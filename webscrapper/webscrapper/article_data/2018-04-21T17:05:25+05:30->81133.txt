NEW DELHI: Vice-President and   chairman M   is likely to take some time in deciding whether there are sufficient grounds to set up an inquiry into charges levelled by opposition parties 
  . 

 
 The VP is expected to consult opinion and seek court records to ascertain 
  adds up to “proved misconduct and incapability” — necessary grounds for the removal of a judge. If he is not convinced, the complaint will not proceed any further. Given the highly politicised nature of the case against the CJI, the RS chair will need to decide whether the complaint can stand on its own. 
 
 Given that the opposition notice against the CJI is “unprecedented”, V-P is expected to be very particular that the legal and constitutional argument in considering, or possibly not entertaining, the notice is well reasoned. 
 
  
  
 
 He will give due consideration to the fact that any decision to probe the CJI can impact public perception of judiciary and the standing and reputation of CJI Misra. Opposition sources indicated that in case the notice is not admitted, they can move the SC seeking a direction to the   chairman to consider the complaint. 
 
 
 
 
 The view in government and BJP, articulated by FM   and BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi, is that the opposition notice is an attempt to keep alive the controversy over judge 
  in order to embarrass party chief Amit Shah. 
 
 This makes it quite clear that NDA constituents will oppose any move to consider the motion and some other parties, like BJD, have also said they will not support any censure of the CJI. ADMK and TRS are also in this bloc and so far TDP has not indicated whether it will be part of the move.
