PITHORAGARH: A candidate of Uttarakhand Kranti Dal (UKD) has promised to shut down all the liquor shops in the villages of Dwarahat constituency if voted to power from there.

  UKD president  , who is the party candidate from Dwarahat seat, has released an affidavit saying that he would help formulate policies to shut down liquor shops in villages.
  He has also promised to address the menace of wild animals, including the monkeys.
 
  “These issues are not limited to only Dwarahat, but the entire hills of Uttarakhand are suffering due to it. If elected, I would definitely put pressure on the government to formulate policies to shut down liquor shops in villages,” Tripathi said.
 
  “I would help put a ban on liquor that are made in homes. I will also ask the women groups to put pressure on the people who give their land to liquor shops. There could be other ways also, like forming of a public movement on the lines of ‘Nasha Nehi, Rojgar Dilao’,” the UKD candidate said.
 
  On man-animal conflict, he suggested wired fences around farmed lands.
 
  “Working with forest department on producing food in forests will be one big step. Next will be sterilizing of monkeys in the hills. Monkeys should not be transported from cities to hills. They should only be transported to reserve forests that have enough food for them,” said Tripathi.
 
  In 2007, Tripathi had won the Dwarahat seat. However, in 2012, Madan Singh Bisht defeated Tripathi by 3,326 votes. Both the candidates are facing each other this time too.
 
  A total 10 candidates are contesting from this seat including Mahesh Negi from BJP, Girish Choudhary from BSP and four independents.
