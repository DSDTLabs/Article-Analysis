BENGALURU: A magistrate court in Bengaluru on Monday gave its go-ahead for subjecting K T Naveen Kumar alias Hotte Manja, who has been arrested in connection with the murder of journalist-activist  , to a narco-analysis test.

 The 3rd additional chief metropolitan magistrate (ACMM) court allowed the Special Investigation Team (SIT), probing Gauri’s killing, to conduct narco analysis after the accused gave his consent to the test.
 
 Advocate A Vedamurthy said Naveen Kumar discussed with him about the impact of narco analysis on Sunday. “He is innocent and has been framed in the case. He has agreed to the test, hoping he will be set free after his innocence is proved. Naveen wants the truth to come out and hence gave his consent,” Vedamurthy told TOI.
 
 Sources in SIT said they may get the test done at the   in Gujarat as there is no such provision to do it in FSL ,Madiwala. 
 
 The court remanded Naveen in judicial custody for 14 days.
 
 Naveen, a   leader from Maddur taluk in Mandya district, was arrested by Upparpet police on February 17 and 15 live bullets were recovered from him. Suspecting his role in the   murder case, the SIT took him into custody on March 2.
