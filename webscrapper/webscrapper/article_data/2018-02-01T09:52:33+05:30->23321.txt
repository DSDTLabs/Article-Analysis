COIMBATORE: The   at the   (TNAU) is working on setting up a knowledge park on   cultivation. The centre has started the initial steps to set up the park, said A S  , head of the department of plant pathology, TNAU, who also heads the centre. 

 “We have planned to complete the park in phases,” he said. “Initially, we are working on setting up cropping rooms for the mushrooms that are cultivated in Tamil Nadu,” said Krishnamoorthy.
 
 The centre, which has been working on UGC-sponsored projects, is also working on to set up a shiitake mushroom cultivation unit in collaboration with a Japanese firm. The park would be expanded in tandem with such projects, Krishnamoorthy added.
 
 The park would showcase the cultivation methods and characteristics of mushrooms which grow in different agro-climactic zones. Also methods to tap green energy for mushroom cultivation would be exhibited in the park, he added.
 
 The centre conducts one-day training programmes on mushroom cultivation on the fifth of every month. It also does a lot of work on tapping other useful aspects of mushrooms. 
 
 Krishnamoorthy said apart from mushrooms being used as food, the spent waste of mushroom cultivation can be used as animal feed and can also be composted and used as natural manure. “We are planning to bring in all such aspects of mushroom cultivation in the park,” he said.
 
 The centre sells mushroom spawns and seeds to cultivators. It plans to setup the park using this self-generated money, Krishnamoorthy added.
