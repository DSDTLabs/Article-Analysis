NEW DELHI: Alert night patrolling officers in Ranjeet Nagar, central Delhi, helped foul a   attempt where an IAS aspirant was attacked on Sunday night. The policemen nabbed the father-son duo in the act as they started to run seeing them. 

 The accused, Tinku (30) and Khajan Singh (50) targeted the victim, Vivek Kumar, while he was walking back home after attending a function at Pusa. DCP (central) Mandeep Randhawa said before Kumar could even do anything, one of the accused choked him while the other hurled abuses and punched him. They then took away his mobile phone from his pocket. 
 
 Two   patrolling the area noticed the men attacking Kumar and rushed to his rescue. Seeing the cops, the accused pushed Kumar and fled, but was chased down later and the phone was recovered. The accused told cops that they had been committing the crime for five years to buy drugs.
