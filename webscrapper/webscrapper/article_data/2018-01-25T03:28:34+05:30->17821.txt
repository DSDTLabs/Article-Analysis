BHUBANESWAR: BJD on Wednesday suspended its highprofile MP, Baijayant Panda, from primary membership, accusing him of indulging in anti-party activities. 

 The decision was announced in Bhubaneswar by party vice-president  , who said the   MP had been trying to weaken BJD in the state and in New Delhi. “Shri Baijayant Panda has been directly and indirectly indulging in activities aimed at weakening BJD, whether it is in Parliament, the state, constituency or media space —no opportunity was missed by   to criticise BJD and eulogise the opposition,” a BJD statement said. 
 
 It claimed that during the panchayat election Panda didn’t campaign for party candidates, not even in his own continuency, and, on the other hand,supported opposition candidates, a behaviour completely against the interest of the party that sent him to Parliament four times. 
 
 Taking all this into account, “party president   has suspended Panda from the primary membership of BJD with immediate effect”, it added. Reacting to the party’s decision, Baijayant tweeted: “I’m shocked at this news Very very sad @Naveen_Odisha didn’t see thru the con-spiracy agnst me led by an IAS ofcr now controlling th party. I vehemently deny the allegations agnst me, they are entirely false & baseless. I will pray to Jagannath for guidance b4 i respond further.” 
 
 In May, Panda, who many in the party feel is moving closer to BJP, was removed as BJD’s spokesperson in Parliament after he alleged a section of bureaucrats were interfering in the affairs of the party and the government.
