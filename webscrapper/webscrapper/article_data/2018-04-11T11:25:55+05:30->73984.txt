HYDERABAD: A day after a four year-old nursery student of Krishnaveni Talent School was allegedly thrashed by his teacher for non-payment of fees, parents and members of the Students Federation of India protested in front of the school at Meerpet demanding action against the management.

 The victim’s parents alleged that Swaroopa, the teacher who allegedly punished their son Nitin, was infamous among students for her temper and claimed this is not the first time she punished the child.
 
 “As soon as Nitin reached home on Monday, he started crying. When I enquired, he said the teacher had thrashed him but he did not know why. The teacher punished him in an inhuman way. There are bruises all over his body. This is no way to treat a four-year-old,” said Nitin’s mother Renuka J, adding they had already paid ₹10,000 towards the fee and only ₹1,000 was pending.
 
 The child’s father Shekhar said he had earlier gone to the school and asked them not beat children. “Nitin was punished by the same teacher multiple times, so were my brother’s children. So, we visited the school and requested them to not beat the children but they still punished my kid and now he is scared to go to school,” said Shekhar, a resident of  , a slum area.
 
 Pointing out he is a plumber by profession and his wife works as domestic help, Shekhar said they had enrolled their sons in a private school as they wanted them to have a good education and decent life.
 
 Meerpet police said they have arrested the teacher, principal, and school director and produced them in court.
 
 “The child seems to have been punished for not performing well in exams. He was thrashed badly. While the case has been registered against the teacher, the principal and director were also made party to it as they failed to take action,” said Ch  , inspector of police, Meerpet.
 
 Activists demanded that the recognition of the school be cancelled immediately.
