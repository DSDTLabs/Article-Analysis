Coimbatore: For the first time in the history of liberalised India, gross as well as net market borrowings of state governments are budgeted to be similar to that of the central government. On an aggregate basis, states’ gross borrowings are budgeted to rise to Rs 5.5 lakh crore or 2.9% of GDP (gross domestic product), while net borrowings are expected to rise to Rs 4.2 lakh crore or 2.3% of GDP in 2018-19.

 This is because states are planning to finance as much as nearly 91% of their deficit through market borrowings as against around 66% by the central government. Gross borrowings by state governments are projected to increase 28.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) during 2018-19. 
 
 Aggregate gross debt of states crossed 25% of GDP, according to revised estimates for 2017-18 from the recent low of 21.7% in 2014-15. It is budgeted to rise marginally to 25.3% of GDP in 2018-19.
 
 States have consistently increased their reliance on market borrowings to finance fiscal deficit in the past few years. 
 
 While the states have increased their reliance on market borrowings, the centre has reduced it during the last five years. In 2018-19, while the states have budgeted to finance 91% of their deficit by market borrowings, the centre has budgeted only 66%. The fiscal deficit of states widened during the past four years with aggregate gross debt or total liabilities also turning unfavourable. 
 
 From its two-decade-low of 21.7% of GDP in 2014-15, aggregate debt crossed 25% in 2017-18, according to revised estimates, for the first time since 2019-10. Aggregate debt is budgeted to increase to 25.3% of GDP in 2018-19. According to the indicative calendar of market borrowings by state governments released by the RBI this month, states are planning to borrow Rs 1.16 lakh crore-Rs 1.28 lakh crore in the first quarter of 2018-19. This would be 21%-23% of gross market borrowings budgeted by the state governments for the full year, according to estimates by Motilal Oswal Securities (MOSL). 
 
 A look at the past trends reveals that states tend to borrow about 16% of their gross borrowings in the first quarter. Overall, the combined gross market borrowings of the centre and states are budgeted to be about Rs 11 lakh crore in 2018-19. States are budgeted to borrow similar amount as the centre for the first time in India’s economic history. Nonetheless, gross market borrowings of the general government (centre and states) are budgeted to fall from 6.1% of GDP in 2017-18 as per revised estimates to 5.9% in 2018-19, according to budget estimates, marking the lowest level in eleven years
 
 Notwithstanding the election year, states’ total spending is budgeted to grow 11.4% y-o-y in 2018-19, marking the slowest pace in 13 years, according to estimates. As many as 10 states, accounting for about 40% of national GDP, will have elections in 2019.
 
 Notably, states’ deficit in 2017-18, according to revised estimates, was 2.8% of GDP, higher than 2.6% budgeted last year. For 2018-19, Gujarat and Maharashtra have budgeted the least deficit of sub-2% of GSDP (gross state domestic product), while Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab have budgeted the highest deficit of over 4% of GSDP.
