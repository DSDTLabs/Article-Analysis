MARGAO: Consumers, at a recent JERC public hearing, opposed the power department’s proposed tariff hike terming it an unnecessary burden on the honest consumer, even as little was being done to thwart  .

 Domestic consumer   alleged non-paying consumers, many of whom own second homes in Goa, contribute to the revenue gap. Others complained of domestic charges being paid for premises utilised commercially. The department is not taking people to task, consumers complained, adding that if a plaint is filed about a consumer using a domestic connection for commercial purpose, the complainant’s identity is revealed to the erring party. Suggestions to form an enforcement wing to concentrate on power theft were also aired.
 
 Cuncolim civic and consumer forum representative   pointed out to power wastage due to street lights left on during the day.
