Panaji: The CBI on Thursday told the high court of Bombay at Goa that there was no delay in registering the FIR in the death case of British teenager   Keeling.

 CBI, is arguing an appeal filed by it challenging the acquittal of two accused by the Goa children’s court in September 2016.
 
 CBI’s senior counsel Ejaz Khan told the court that Keeling’s mother was pursuing the case right from the time the incident occurred at Anjuna in February 2008 and that there was no lapse of time. Khan stated that no two FIRs were filed in the case, and that even if there was procedural or administrative delay, it shouldn’t affect the nature of the crime.
 
 Following an outcry over the matter, the case was transferred from Anjuna police to the CBI. Goa children’s court in September 2016 acquitted Samson D’Souza and Placido Carvalho who were charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. TNN
