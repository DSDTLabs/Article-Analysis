MUMBAI: Mumbai may find a place on the moon. A lunar-related project, led by  , a former student of   in Borivli, has been shortlisted to fly to the moon by TeamIndus, India's first private lunar mission. The project is called Team EARS, short for Electrostatics Active Radiation Shield.

 Vaidya's Mumbai-registered project and another from Italy were declared winners in TeamIndus's Lab2Moon contest on March 15, which had invited students from across the world to design and build an experiment that could be flown to the moon.
 
 Vaidya, who is now employed in Pune, told TOI that the project is aimed to protect future human settlers on the moon from radiation. “The idea is to build an electrostatic radiation shield around a spacecraft and lunar habitat,“ he said. His team members are  , studying in  , and Aniket Kamat of Kolhapur.
 
 Vaidya said the main challenge for the team now is to obtain corporate funding of Rs 4 crore by April 15 to send their project, which weighs a mere 250gm with three vats of power, to the moon. “Once we obtain sponsorship, we have to begin work on the flight model of the experiment, which has to be ready by October,“ said Vaidya.
 
 TeamIndus is the sole Indian participant in the global Google Lunar X Prize competition, which envisages landing a spacecraft on the moon with a rover.
 
 Provisionally, TeamIndus is slated for launch at Sriharikota on December 28, and touch down on the moon's Mare Imbrium in the early hours of January 26, 2018.
