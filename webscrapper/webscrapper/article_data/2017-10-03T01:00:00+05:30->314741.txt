Kareena Kapoor has always handled the media with ease and confidence. And style, of course. Whether she is flashing a smile for the   every time she is ‘snapped’, or she’s flaunting her baby bump with pride, during her pregnancy days. She’s cool about it and that’s why the paps love her. And now, their hot favourite is none other than the little Khan —  . Pictures of him snuggled in his parents’ arms evoke oohh…and awwws out of people. We are guessing that by the time he’s on tiny toes, he will be comfortably basking in the  . Ask papa Saif about his son being a star on   and he says, “I think he will soon get used to being clicked and hopefully, he should get comfortable with it, too. If he grows up to be like me, I think at some point the poor chap will wish no one was watching him. I am afraid; all this just goes with the territory”. He laughs and adds, “Taimur is rather delectable, so I don’t blame anyone. It’s a price he has to pay for it.”
