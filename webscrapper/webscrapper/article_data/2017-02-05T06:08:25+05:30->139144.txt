MUMBAI: Election officials have rejected   of two sitting corporators — Dilip Patel and Pratiksha Ghuge — along with 138 others on “technical” grounds, effectively ending their dream of contesting the   election on February 21. 

 On Saturday, Patel’s nomination was rejected over a 2015 court order. He remained unavailable for comment. Ghuge plans to move court. She alleged her nomination was rejected over a “silly” reason—an affidavit page that was missing from her submitted documents. 
 
 In 2015, the BMC had disqualified senior   corporator Dilip Patel following a court order for submitting a forged caste certificate in the 2012 BMC election. Patel had got a stay on his disqualification and had been attending BMC meetings. He had filed his nomination from Ward 58, Goregaon, on Friday. 
 
 Ghuge had negotiated to get a Congress ticket at the very last moment. She is a sitting NCP corporator from Ghatkopar and was exploring the option of contesting on a BJP ticket. On Friday, though, she learned that the BJP did not intend to nominate her and she contacted Congress. “It is the returning official’s high-handedness. They told us that one of the pages in the affidavit was missing. The rejection was over a technical mistake at their end. We will file a writ in court,” said Pratiksha’s husband Raju Ghuge.
