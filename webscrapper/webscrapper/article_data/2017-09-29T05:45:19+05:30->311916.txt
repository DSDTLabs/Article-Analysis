AHMEDABAD: Does it take 45 days to   on three blocks of   taken for detecting if the   used for city roads met quality standards? Senior   explain that there are a total of nine tests which are conducted on bitumen and seven tests on aggregate to reveal their physical properties and their interaction with water. A cursory glance over these tests reveals that the maximum prescribed time to conduct these basic tests is not more than two days per sample, while in case of old road samples it may extend a day for chemical tests to detect composition of the road the road material.

 On bitumen tests like penetration, ductility, softening point, specific gravity, viscosity, flash and fire point, float, water content and loss on heating, tests are done to judge the quality of the bitumen used. While in case of aggregate, the tests include crushing, abrasion, impact, soundness shape, specific gravity and water absorption. 
 
 “It does not take 45 days to test three samples of road material any way. Most tests are physical tests. Ahmedabad roads have largely broken because of improper road geometry and slopes. Any compromise on these fronts will affect the quality of roads during rains,” says former VC Gujarat University and professor in civil engineering Dr M N Patel.
 
 A senior AMC official told TOI, “There are a few chemical tests performed to detect the composition of material, the rest all lab tests are meant to check physical property of the material used,” says the senior AMC official.
