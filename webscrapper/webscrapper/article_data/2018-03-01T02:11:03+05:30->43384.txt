Chennai/Villupuram: While expressing deep anguish over the series of attacks on dalit people in Villupuram district,   founder leader   urged the Tamil Nadu government to take stringent action against the culprits involved in the crime. 
 
 “I am deeply pained over the series of attacks on dalit people in Villupuram district. The culprits, involved in the brutal murders and sexual assaults, whoever they might be, must be arrested and produced before the court of law. I urge the Tamil Nadu government to take stringent action in an effort to curb atrocities in the name of castes,” he said in a statement. 
  
 He strongly condemned the police for ‘attempting to protect the culprits involved in the crimes’. Police have not arrested anyone even a week after the brutal attack. “Police initially booked a case of suspicious death but were forced to alter it as a murder after the relatives and villagers registered a strong protest against it,” he said. 
  
 An eight-year-old dalit boy was hacked to death, while his mother and sister were brutally attacked by unidentified culprits at Vellamputhur village under Arakandanallur police station limits on February 22. The mother and daughter, who are undergoing treatment at Jipmer, are yet to regain their consciousness.
