Even today, the younger generations of Karnataka as well as other people visiting Bengaluru do not know many things about Sir M Visvesvaraya, his first patent, his contributions to India and the world. This is our attempt to collect details, create records and digitize them. This way, we can also share the same with the public.”
 
 The centenary celebrations kickstart on Saturday, and will go on till Tuesday. A fashion show showcasing the wardrobes of the Wadiyars, the Mysuru rulers, will mark the inaugural. Sunday evening will see the melodious all-women pancha veena players along with dance recitals. The team from Shivamogga, headed by musician  , is among the few who still play the pancha veena, which was played in the times of the Wadiyars.
