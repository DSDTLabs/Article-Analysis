NEW DELHI: The   on Monday directed former Ranbaxy promoters - Malvinder (top) and Shivinder Singh -to maintain status quo on the assets they have disclosed during Japanese pharma major   Sankyo's case to enforce a Rs 3,500 crore international arbitral award against them.

 Justice Jayant Nath said, "Respondents to maintain status quo...till the next date of hearing, February 26." The court also directed the brothers and 12 others, including their family members and companies, to come up with a plan on how they seek to deposit the amount of Rs 3,500 crore. They had disclosed their assets to the court in sealed covers on two occasions in December 2016 and March 2017 during the pendency of Daiichi's plea, seeking enforcement of the 2016 arbitral award passed by a Singapore tribunal against the Singh brothers.
 
 The HC had on January 31 held that the 2016 award can be enforced against the Singh brothers. In 2016, a Singapore tribunal had passed an award in favour of Japanese pharma major Daiichi Sankyo on its allegation that the former promoters of   concealed information about proceedings against them by   (FDA) and its department of justice. Paving the way for enforcement of the arbitral award, HC had noted it was "clearly within the domain of the Arbitral Tribunal to assess damages. The award has given various reasons for having rejected the suggested formula/computation by the respondent."
