DHARAMSHALA: Due to chilling cold in  , hill station McLeodganj is wearing a deserted look lacking tourist activity here. Those in the tourism industry, including chefs, tattoo designers, certain hoteliers and tour operators, are awaiting the end of winter season and focusing on Goa and Rajasthan these days.

 Despite ample opportunities, the concerned departments, including local administration, tourism development board and corporation, have not yet explored any way out to deal with off season. “There are many winged guests in the Pong lake these days and hot water springs can be explored as opportunity to promote tourism in winters but no effort has been made in this direction,” said Dinanath Sharma, a famous chef from Gaggal near here. 
 
 Most of the cafes and restaurants in Dharamkot village are closed these days. Only social activists or students of various disciplines related to Buddhism and other healing therapies are present in town.
 
 The region is also known for cancer treatment after few Tibetan doctors who have earned good name in the country, have been operating here. “This period is considered as off season and particularly after the Republic Day holidays, the movement is zero in this region. It will start gaining pace by February end,” said Parvesh Kumar, a taxi operator in McLeodganj.
 
 Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama, who is a resident of this town, holds major Buddhism teachings, but outside the state due to lack of infrastructure. Otherwise, it could have fetched a good footfall from across the globe. “Some years back, when Dalai Lama used to hold teachings here, people from various countries used to come for long stay. But now, the teachings her are only for two or three days, while major   teachings are being held outside the state,” told Deepak Kumar, a travel agent here.
