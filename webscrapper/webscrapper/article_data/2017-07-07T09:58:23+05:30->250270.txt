 TGSS spokesperson Jay Lal said, “Central government is nervous due to the indefinite strike by Surat traders. Our counterparts across the state are also on strike to protest against police atrocities on the traders. We are hopeful that the Centre will accept our ‘No GST’ demand.”
 
 The TGSS announced a mammoth rally under the leadership of Hitesh Sanklecha, a textile trader from Good Luck Market who is on an indefinite hunger strike for the last six days. Sanklecha was felicitated for going on hunger strike on behalf of 75,000 textile traders. 
 
 Sanklecha told TOI, “We are planning a mammoth rally of traders on July 8. Our target is to gather more than one lakh traders from Surat and other states. I will be on hunger strike for an indefinite period until the government accepts our demand for ‘No GST’ on fabrics.”
