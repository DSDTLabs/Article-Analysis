Mumbai: Senior clerics and community leaders have appealed for a quiet, peaceful   or Night of Salvation on May 11. Shab-e-Baraat, a fortnight ahead of Ramzan, is believed to be a blessed night that should be spent in prayers. Unfortunately, many youths turn it into a night of   and nuisance.

 “The night is an occasion to seek divine blessings and ask for forgiveness. Imams in different mosques have started telling the youths to avoid creating traffic jams and spend time in prayers either at home, their local mosque or dargah,” said Grant Road-based Madrassa Jamia Ashrafia Qadria’s head Maulana Syed Moin Ashraf. He added that cops should deal with the revelers firmly.
 
 Mahim Dargah’s managing trustee   said that youths should avoid visiting different mosques and dargahs during the night. “We have told the youths not to hop from one dargah to another. Celebrations should not create law and order problem and inconvenience to residents or commuters,” said Khandwani. He added that volunteers would help the cops manage traffic during the night.
 
 Maulana  , vice-president, Sunni Dawate Islami said, “Since the Prophet also visited Jannatul Baqih, the famous kabrastan near the holy mosque in Medina, it is desirable that Muslims too visit graves of their parents and relatives and pray for their forgiveness. The night is sacred and it should not be frittered away in meaningless activities like bursting crackers and biking recklessly,” he said.
