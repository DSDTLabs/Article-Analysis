MUMBAI: A senior citizen claimed he was bitten by   during his journey from New Delhi to   by India’s premier train,  , on January 7.

 Brijbhusan Sood (65) was upset with hygiene on the train and the railways’ apathetic attitude in dealing with the medical emergency. The rat bit Sood above his right ear around 11.40pm before the train reached Nagada station, he said.
 
 The ticket examiner was informed but medical help could not be provided as a station was fast approaching. Sood said, “The medical team did not turn up at Ratlam too, even though I was bleeding. Later, a lady doctor arrived at Vadodara station but her visit was futile. My handkerchief had blood marks as I was bleeding during the three-and-a-half hour journey between Nagada and Vadodara.”
 
 Sood said, “She gave me some medicines but I was apprehensive to take them as I am heart patient and was vary of side-effects. She did not show interest in checking the medicines I take for my ailment. She also did not carry any injection, and only on my insistence wrote a prescription, and told me to buy it on reaching Mumbai. The doctor charged me Rs500 for no fault of mine.”
 
 Sood, a senior sale manager with a private firm, said, “A friend took me to a doctor at Grant Road, who administered me an injection so that the infection does not spread. I am regular Rajdhani commuter and rodents are common, but this is the first time that I have been hurt.”
 
 A railway doctor claimed there was no rat bite but the passenger had some rash; also, there were no blood marks on the pillow. Sood said, “I could not find the handkerchief as it was too dark.”
 
 WR’s chief public relations officer Ravinder Bhakar said, “The pest control treatment of the train was done on January 5, and all rat control measures were taken, besides fumigation for rodents which move in the corners of coaches.”
