Surat: A number of organizations have started campaigning for boycott of Chinese products in the city. Some of them burnt Chinese products at different places in the city. An organization asked people to refrain from buying Chinese rakhis for Rakshabandhan festival next month. 

 On Monday, members of Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Maha Sabha burnt Chinese products at Sudama Chowk. General secretary of the organization Pintul Kakadia said, “When the situation on Chinese border is very tense how can we use Chinese products?” He said that they will be going from door to door to Chinese products and torch them. 
 
 A few days ago a youth organization called for the boycott of Chinese rakhis and some leaders of some sections of the society said, “If the situation escalates on border, it becomes our duty to boycott product of enemy nation.”
 
 Recently, state Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki, criticized Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani saying, “On one side Chinese army is intruding into out territory with tensions along the border, on the other hand our CM is signing MoUs with Chinese companies, asking them to set up plant in our state.”
 
 A member of VHP told TOI, “Though we have not given any call till now, we would do so soon if situation on border escalates further.”
