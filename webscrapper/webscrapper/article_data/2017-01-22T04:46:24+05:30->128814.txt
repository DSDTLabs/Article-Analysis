CHENNAI: A 74-year-old doctor was found murdered in his apartment at Shastri Nagar, Adyar on Saturday morning. 

 Police identified him as   and said preliminary investigations revealed no cash or valuables were missing.
 
 Early in the morning, his tenant   noticed Reddy's room open and the man dead with his throat slit. He immediately alerted the police control room. A team from the Shastri Nagar police station arrived at G K Riverbank Apartments on Second Cross Street, Karpagam Garden Avenue, and sent the body to Government   for autopsy.
 
 Reddy had been living alone in the four-bedroom apartment since the death of his wife Usha, also a doctor, in 2011, police said. The couple had no children.
 
 He let out three bedrooms to Chandrasekaran, who runs a business in the city. His tenants used an entrance, while Reddy used another entrance, police said.
 
 Chandrasekaran told police he last saw Reddy in his room at 9.30pm on Friday and then he retired to bed. 
 
 A senior police officer said inquiries with other residents of the apartment block and his tenants revealed that Reddy had stopped practising medicine a while ago. "Instead he was into private financing business in the area," he said.
 
 It is suspected that he may have been killed due to a money transaction gone wrong. Some residents of the complex told police Reddy had sacked his maid, a native of  , 10 days ago over some valuables missing from his room. She had since returned to her native place and a special team has left for that state to question her, an officer said.
 
 Investigators have collected a diary and documents from his house that they believe could throw some light into the slain main's financing business. 
 
 They are also scanning CCTV footage collected from some shops, showrooms and apartment complexes on the street.
