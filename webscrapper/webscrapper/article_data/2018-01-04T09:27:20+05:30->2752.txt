PANAJI: Chief minister   on Wednesday admitted that beach shack policy conditions are being violated. “I agree,” he said, responding to queries at a cabinet briefing.

 Director of   Menino D’Souza said they are in the process of finalising a stragety to curb illegalities by shack operators. 
 
 This paper, in its January 2 edition, had front-paged a report about rampant violations by beach shack operators, particularly along the Baga-Calangute beach stretch.
 
 Most   at Baga   had foldable tents erected on the beach, and also played loud music till the wee hours of morning even as beach shack policy mandates that they should shut shop by 10 pm.
 
 A source said most of the shack allottees did not install tents after the TOI report. Also, police on the intervening night of January 2 made shacks stop blasting music at about 2 am. 
 
 The tourism department has also started conducting a survey to find out how many shacks have fire-fighting equipment installed.
 
 D’Souza said he will receive a complete report on Thursday. The beach shack policy in force requires shack allottees to install fire safety equipment as also CCTV cameras. These provisions have not been strictly implemented.
 
 D’Souza said they have asked shack operators to comply with the conditions.
 
 Tourism department has flying squads to crack down on violators but it is yet to start working.
