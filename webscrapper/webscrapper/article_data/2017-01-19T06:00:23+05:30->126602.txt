AHMEDABAD: Kishoresinh Rathod, the son of ex-MLA Bhavsinh Rathod who is accused in the   seizure case, had met Manoj Jain and Jay Mukhi at a Mumbai Hotel before going to Mombasa in   to meet international drug baron  . Rathod was recently nabbed by Gujarat ATS from the   on the border of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

 ATS sources probing the Rs 270 ephedrine seizure case visited the hotel in Mumbai with Rathod to investigate. “We have a witness who was at the meeting between Manoj Jain, the owner of the factory in Solapur from where ephedrine worth Rs 2,000 crore was seized after the raids in Ahmedabad,” added an ATS official.
 
 After the meeting in Mumbai, Rathod, Jay Mukhi and Jain went to Mombasa and met Goswami. They then struck a deal to smuggle the ephedrine from a Gujarat port hidden in bajra sacks.
 
 “They meet four times in Mombasa before sealing the deal with Goswami. We have also traced the   firm through which Goswami routed the Rs 90 lakh first instalment for the drug deal,” said an ATS official.
 
 In May 2016, Gujarat ATS and city crime branch teams had seized large quantity of ephedrine and arrested Narendra Kacha, who was allegedly hired by Kishoresinh Rathod to make methamphetamine from ephedrine.
 
 A few days’ later, Thane police raided a factory in Solapur and seized ephedrine worth Rs 2,000 crores. Rathod is also accused in the case of the Rs 2,000 crore ephedrine seizure case. ‘Rathod was running his drug racket with help from Jay Mukhi, Punit Singeri and Manoj Jain, who were later arrested by Thane Police and brought by us on transfer warrant in our ephedrine seizure case,” added a senior ATS official.
