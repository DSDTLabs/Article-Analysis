HYDERABAD: Wondering whether fixing stringent norms for testing the ability of a person aspiring to become a teacher can be faulted at all, Justice M S   of the   on Friday refused to stay the ongoing process pertaining to the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) being conducted by the Telangana school education department.

 The judge was dealing with a petition filed by   and seven others from various state districts who were urging the court to stay the TET-2017 citing the raised standards of testing as a reason. B  , the counsel for the petitioners, told the court that the syllubus fixed by the authorities for the test is far in excess of the standards fixed by the   (NCTE). The candidates have prepared themselves keeping in view the existing standards and the changed and difficult standards now fixed have become a huge concern for them, she explained while challenging the state's GO Ms No 51 issued on April 16, 2017. She said that this was the GO that raised the bar of the standards in a unilateral way and sought a stay on the TET exam scheduled to be held on July 23, 2017.
 
 Telangana state counsel Sanjeev Kumar refuted these contentions and said that the eligibility criterion fixed by them is in tune with the existing norms. Moreover, we followed the Teacher Education Rules while fixing the eligibility criterion, he added.
 
 The judge sought to know from both the state and the petitioners if there was any prohibition on raising standards.Why can't a higher standard be fixed for teachers who have to impart quality education, he asked. While issuing notices to the state and school education authorities and directing them to file counters, the judge posted the case to three weeks.
