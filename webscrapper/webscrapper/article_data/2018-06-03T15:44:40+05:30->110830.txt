A fun night out with friends turned into a rather unpleasant experience  . The incident took place recently, when the actor was in Sydney to anchor an event. Post hosting, Sidharth decided to visit a nightclub with his friends. However, he was denied entry and was told that inked men — especially those with tattoos on the neck — are not allowed in the pub. Sidharth says, “I tried to reason it out with them, but it yielded no result. The incident shook me, as it amounted to racism against people with tattoos. How can a person’s character be judged on the basis of his tattoos?”

 Sidharth says that the pub’s decision may have something to do with an Australian gangsters’ group. “Considered to be extremely ruthless, one of the characteristics of these gangsters is the tattoos on their neck. So, maybe, they mistook me to be a bikie. The fact that I don’t have conventional Indian looks could have fuelled their suspicion,” he signs off.
