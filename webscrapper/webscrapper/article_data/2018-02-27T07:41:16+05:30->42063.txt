SURAT: Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre IAS officers and staffers in the Union territories of Daman, Diu and Dadra and   (DNH) observed a two-minute silence at 1.30pm on Monday as a mark of protest against the alleged attack on Delhi chief secretary   by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs a few days. 

 The AGMUT cadre officers extended their support to the nationwide silent protest by their colleagues against the attack. 
 
 A statement issued by them said the attack on the chief secretary was carried out in the presence of Delhi chief minister and deputy chief minister by some MLAs of AAP on February 20.
 
  The entire AGMUT cadre in the Union territory of Daman, Diu and DNH condemns the act of violence against the AGMUT cadre IAS officer. 
 
 It is seen by many as an assault on the federal structure of India. The all-India services, which include IAS, IPS and  , were set up under the Constitution of India to safeguard the federal structure of the country. Hence, the assault on the chief secretary is an attack on the federal framework, top bureaucrats said.
