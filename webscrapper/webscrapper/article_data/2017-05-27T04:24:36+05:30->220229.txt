MUMBAI The four   nabbed from   on March 10 for   four  , had helped five others from the island nation fly to London, similarly, using   earlier this year, the chargesheet filed by Sahar police says.

 On March 10, the eight foreign nationals were caught at the boarding gates of the international and domestic sections of Terminal 2, where the UK nationals gave their boarding passes for a London flight to the Sri Lankans, who, in turn, gave them their boarding passes for an Ahmedabad flight. “The chargesheet mentions that the Sri Lankans had got fake Indian passports in the name of the UK nationals, but with Chennai addresses,” said an investigator. The 678-page chargesheet was filed in the Andheri Metropolitan Magistrate Court on May 12. 
 
 “The racket was busted when immigration officials received a tip-off that a few foreigners had skipped immigration checks and they alerted all boarding gates," said a police officer. "The officials at Gate No. 78 in the international section stopped the Sri Lankans as the boarding passes they were carrying had British-sounding names."
 
 So far, 10 people, including two women, have been arrested. “We are on the lookout for one more Sri Lankan agent and the Indian agent who helped them get fake Indian passports. The four UK nationals —Bower Oliver (27), Quillian Alan (43), Fivehats Captain (56) and Warner Ann (36) — have said they had helped five other Sri Lankans to fly to London using the same modus operandi on January 29, February 11 and February 26,” said Sahar police senior inspector BT Mukhedkar.
 
 The agents allegedly demanded Rs 17 lakh each from the Sri Lankans—Arunasalam Shuthakaran (34), Kannathasan Karththeepan (26), Gajan Chandrabalan (31). Along with the chargesheet, police have attached the fake passports, four boarding passes of the UK flight and SIM cards given to the eight foreigners by the agents.
