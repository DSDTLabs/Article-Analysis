Trichy: A protest against the setting up of a   wine shop near Thuraiyur on the outskirts of Trichy turned violent on Thursday with the police resorting to caning of the protesters including women. In all, 21 people including nine women were arrested with one woman sustaining a mild injury on her hand in the lathicharge. 

 The wine shop at Ammapatti which was opened on May 5 had become the bone of contention between the people of Kamatchipuram, Aswini Nagar, Shanmuga Nagar, Mangala Garden and Mohammadiya Nagar new housing board colony on one side and Tasmac on the other. About 6,000 people were residing in and around these areas. 
 
 On Thursday, as many as 100 people led by a women’s club gathered in front of the Tasmac wine shop at Mangalapuram in Ammapatti panchayat to register their protest against the opening of the shop in the residential area. They argued with the Tasmac officials and the Thuraiyur police that the functioning of the shop caused severe inconvenience to the people residing in the area due to the uncivilized activities of the tipplers.
 
 The talks between the protesters and the officials failed to yield a favourable result with the former demanding immediate closure of the shop and the officials turning it down. With the people trying to vandalise the wine shop, the police stepped in and   the protesters. The lathicharge scattered the crowd with women members also getting beaten up by the police. The police arrested 21 people including nine women one of whom sustained an injury. 
 
 The protesters alleged that Tasmac opened the wine shop despite the resolution passed against it at the grama sabha meeting in the village on May 1. Thursday’s incident was only one among a series of protests seen recently at several places in the district against the setting up of wine shops.
