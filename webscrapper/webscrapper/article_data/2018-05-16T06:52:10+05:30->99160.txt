PANAJI: Central motor vehicle rules mandate that at the time of selling a two-wheeler, a vehicle dealer must supply a protective headgear, in other words, a helmet to the buyer. The practice, however, is rarely implemented by automobile dealers across the state.

 Hence, the transport department has issued a notice to the   asking it to abide by the rule.
 
 “Dealers must ensure that vehicles come along with the helmet. We will approach each and every two-wheeler showroom in the state, if need be, till they are all start following the rule,” a transport official told TOI.
 
 The notice read that riders have been using fake  , an issue that has been highlighted in state and district road safety council meetings. Signed by deputy director of transport, GS Narvekar, the notice mandates that the headgear, a helmet in other words, to be supplied by the dealer, should be ISI-marked.
 
 “This is being done in the interest of the rider. We have noticed that many riders use substandard helmets. Dealers must supply ISI-marked helmets. Riders, who already have helmets, need not purchase a new one,” Narvekar said.
 
 The violation of driving without helmet attracts a fine of Rs 100 for a first-time offender and Rs 300 for the subsequent offence. In the first quarter of this year, i.e., from January 1 till March 31, as many as 432,18 violations were detected.
 
 Roland Martins, a member of  , said, “This is a right decision which was long awaited. We have been raising the issue at earlier road safety council meetings. The notification is a positive step. Now, we have to see the ground reality and review how it has to be taken up further. This move will also have an impact on the sale of fake helmets.”
