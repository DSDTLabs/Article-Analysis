NEW DELHI: As   kicks off this week, here's a look back at the six teams to have gotten their hands on the championship in its ten-year existence.

 
 
 
  
  
 Australian spin wizard Shane Warne proved that he is the best captain that Australia never had as he marshalled his resources extremely well as after 58 matches, it was his team Rajasthan Royals that met Chennai Super Kings in the final at the Dr DY Patil Sports Academy in Mumbai on June 1, 2008.
 
 Yusuf Pathan took three wickets but CSK posted a challenging score of 163/5. Pathan shone with the bat too, hitting fours sixes and three fours in his 39-ball 56 before he was run out by Suresh Raina. The match went all the way down the wire as Rajasthan clinched victory on the last ball of the match.
 
 
 
 
  
  
 Held in South Africa due to elections in India, the Adam Gilchrist-led Deccan Chargers, who were the underdogs in the tournament, faced   Bangalore in the final of IPL 2 on May 24, 2009. Bangalore captain   took four wickets to restrict Deccan to 143/6 built around Herschelle Gibbs' unbeaten 53. But none of the Bangalore batsmen put up a decent score and Deccan won the final by six runs.
 
 
 
 
  
  
 After 59 matches, CSK met   in the final at the DY Patil Sports Academy in Mumbai on April 25, 2010. Batting first, Chennai scored 168/5 riding on Raina's unbeaten 57 that came off 35 balls. Mumbai's run chase got off to a bad start as   removed Shikhar Dhawan for a duck in the second over. Harbhajan Singh failed as a pinch-hitter,   waged a lone battle scoring a 45-ball 48, Kieron Pollard was sent in too low down the order at number eight as Chennai emerged victorious by 22 runs to win their first IPL title.
  
 
 
 
  
  
 India won the Cricket World Cup 2011 on April 2 and IPL 4 started on April 8 and throughout the tournament there were talks of cricket overkill. The tournament began with defending champions CSK taking on Kolkata Knight Riders in Chennai, where the home team won a thrilling match by 2 runs.
 
 After 70 matches, RCB met CSK in the first Qualifying Final at the Wankhede Stadium on May 24. Virat Kohli slammed an unbeaten 44-ball 70 as RCB raced to 175/4, but Raina led the CSK run chase with an unbeaten 50-ball 73 to overhaul the target with six wickets in hand and two balls to spare.
 
 In the final versus RCB in Chennai on May 29, Murali Vijay's 52-ball 95, Michael Hussey's 45-ball 63 supported by captain MS  's 13-ball 22 powered CSK to a mammoth 205/5. RCB never really recovered from the onslaught and when R Ashwin dismissed the explosive Chris Gayle in the first over, all hopes were washed away. RCB ended up at 147/8 and CSK won their second successive IPL crown.
 
 
 
 
  
  
 IPL 5 got underway with CSK taking on Mumbai in Chennai on April 4, with Mumbai strolling to an eight-wicket victory largely due to Richard Levi's 35-ball 50 that helped his team to overhaul the 113-run target in 16.5 overs.
 
 After 72 matches of nerve-wrecking cricket, Delhi Daredevils met KKR in the first Qualifying match in Pune on May 22. After fine contributions from the top order comprising of Brendon McCullum, captain Gautam Gambhir and Jacques Kallis, Yusuf smashed 40 runs off 21 balls to take KKR to 162/4 in their 20 overs. Apart from Mahela Jayawardene's 33-ball 40, Delhi's run chase never really got going and they managed 144/8 in their 20 overs.
 
 In the Elimination final, CSK took on Mumbai n Bangalore on May 23. After Hussey's 39-ball 49 and Subramaniam Badrinath's 39-ball 47, Dhoni took the Mumbai bowlers to the cleaners in smashing a 20-ball 51 that was studded with two sixes and six fours to power his team to 187/5. Mumbai ended up with 149/9 to crash out of IPL 5.
 
 Daredevils captain Virender Sehwag stunned one and all when he chose to rest the tournament's leading wicket-taker Morne Morkel in the second Qualifying match against CSK in Chennai on May 25 and that proved to be an huge error as Vijay struck a magnificent 58-ball 113 to power his team to 222/5. Jayawardene hit a 38-ball 55 but none of the other Delhi batsmen coming good with the bat, the visitors folded up at 136 runs in 16.5 overs.
 
 CSK played their third successive IPL final and were hot favourites to win at their home ground on May 27 against KKR. Hussey and Vijay gave them a superb start and Raina smashed five sixes and three fours in his 38-ball 73 to finish at 190/3. KKR lost Gambhir in the first over but Manvinder Bisla and Kallis added 136 runs for the second wicket to put the run chase back on track. Bisla fell to Albie Morkel after a 89-run knock that came off 48 balls and was studded with five sixes and eight fours. Ben Hilfenhaus dismissed Kallis in the 18th over but Shakib Al Hasan and Manoj Tiwary joined forces to take KKR to their first IPL title.
 
 
 
 
  
  
 The 2013 edition was rocked by the spot-fixing and betting scandals and the arrest of CSK owner N Srinivasan's son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan. But cricket went on to outshine the off-field matters as Mumbai won their maiden IPL title beating in the final a team that had denied them title glory three years ago, with a 23-run victory. Playing their second final, Rohit Sharma & Co. tamed CSK at Eden Gardens on May 26.
 
 It was the lusty hitting by Pollard that had given Mumbai a competitive total to defend. The West Indian, who sent the last two deliveries of the innings soaring for sixes, remained unbeaten on a 32-ball 60 as Mumbai reached 148/9. Rocked early at 3/3 and then 39/6 by Lasith Malinga, Mitchell Johnson and Harbhajan Singh, CSK never recovered and finished on 125/9.
 
 Tendulkar promptly declared his retirement after the final.
 
 
 
 
  
  
 Manish Pandey played a belter of an innings to ruin Kings XI Punjab's maiden appearance in an IPL final at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore on June 1. His hurricane 94 (50 ball, 7x4, 6x6) powered KKR to what seemed like an improbable win. The three-wicket win squeezed out with just three balls to spare was a veritable edge-of-the-seat affair and KKR who kept their nerve at crucial stages deservedly took home their second IPL title. Pandey stole the show and the match from KXIP, much to the delight of a legion of KKR and Shah Rukh Khan fans.
 
 Pandey's knock came after KXIP smashed 116 runs in the last eight overs thanks to Wriddhiman Saha's brilliant unbeaten 115 off 75 balls, the first century in an IPL final. Saha took the KKR attack by the scuff of the neck, but in the end came up second to Pandey.
 
 
 
 
  
  
 CSK faltered in an IPL final for the fourth time as they went down to MI by 41 runs in the summit clash at Eden Gardens on May 24, 2015. Mumbai Indians thus joined KKR and CSK to become the third team to win the IPL twice.
 
 Dhoni read the Eden Gardens pitch horribly wrong and handed MI the advantage by opting to bowl first after winning the toss. On a pitch where the ball came on to the bat nicely, the Mumbai batsmen powered their way to 202/5, the second highest total in an IPL final. Rohit and Lendl Simmons feasted on some ordinary bowling by the CSK after opener Parthiv Patel was spectacularly run out by Faf du Plessis on the fifth ball of the match. But for left-arm pacer Ashish Nehra, who conceded just 18 runs in his first three overs, all others went for plenty in their opening spells. Dhoni had no choice but to fall back on his main spinner, Ravichandran Ashwin, as early as the third over but he hardly made any impact and ended up conceding 12 runs in his first over.
 
 Six-time finalists CSK came under pressure after managing just 31 runs in the Powerplay overs, losing opener Hussey in the process. Dwayne Smith and Raina added 66 runs for the second wicket, but once both departed in quick succession, the writing was on the wall for the Yellow Brigade. In the end CSK laboured to 161/8 in their 20 overs, falling short by 41 runs in what turned out to be one-sided final.
 
 
 
 
  
  
 IPL 9 is best remembered for chase master Kohli whose consistency in successful chases has been quite remarkable. RCB needed to win four out of four matches to qualify for the playoffs and their captain smashed 109, 75*, 113 and 54* to take them to the second spot in the points table. Kohli became the only captain to hit two centuries in a single IPL season as he scored 973 runs at an astonishing average of 81.03 with a strike rate of 152.03.
 
 AB de Villiers smacked a 47-ball 79 after Kohli was dismissed for a duck in the first Qualifier against Gujarat Lions to seal a spot in the final where they met an inspiring Hyderabad side led by flamboyant Australian opener David Warner at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore on May 29.
 
 Batting first after winning the toss, Hyderabad racked up 208/7 riding on Warner's 69, Ben Cutting's unbeaten 39 and Yuvraj Singh's 38. The RCB run chase got off to a fiery start as Gayle and Kohli came out all guns blazing. Gayle smacked eight sixes and four fours in his 38-ball 76 and was ably supported by Kohli's 35-ball 54 and till the time both the openers were at the crease, it looked like RCB will canter to their maiden IPL title. But cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties and the match turned on its head when Gayle and Kohli were dismissed within two overs of each other and AB de Villiers also returned to the pavilion after scoring just five runs. The big guns out, Hyderabad choked the rest of the chase to clinch their maiden IPL title as Warner became the third Australian after Warne and Gilchrist to win the coveted trophy as captain.
