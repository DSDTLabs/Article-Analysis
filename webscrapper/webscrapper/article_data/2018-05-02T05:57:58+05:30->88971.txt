NEW DELHI: Before the fivemember collegium headed by   Dipak Misra meets on Wednesday to decide on Uttarakhand Chief Justice KM Joseph’s appointment as   judge, a retired district judge has moved the apex court with a PIL seeking a direction to the Union government to immediately appoint Justice   as an SC judge. 

 
 The petitioner, retired district judge G D Inamdar, said the Centre’s decision to return the collegium’s recommendation on Justice Joseph smacked of political interference in the working of the judiciary and appeared to be a brazen intrusion into independence of judiciary. On Wednesday, the collegium comprising CJI Misra and Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and   will consider the six-page letter written by law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad listing the reasons behind the Centre’s decision to seek reconsideration of the proposal to appoint   as a Supreme Court judge. 
 
 However, till late at night, the CJI had not intimated the other collegium members about the meeting. With retired judges and senior advocates pitching for Justice K M Joseph’s appointment and sitting SC judge Kurian Joseph informing the media that the collegium was likely to reiterate the Uttarakhand CJ’s name, Justice K M Joseph’s appointment could happen sooner than later. 
 
 The Centre had cited that Justice Joseph was 42nd in the list of all-India seniority of HC judges and adequate representation of Kerala HC in the SC as reasons for sending back the proposal. In his petition, Inamdar said the seniority ground was a smokescreen, when the two judgment of the SC which devised the collegium system and laid down the process of selection, had said merit and integrity would be the prime considerations for selection along with seniority.
