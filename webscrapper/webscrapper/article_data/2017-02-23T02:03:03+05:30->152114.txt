NEW DELHI: Delhi government has plans to extend the mid-day meal scheme to girls in classes above  , to help spread the benefits of the nutritional programme to other sections.

 Government officials told TOI that girls of higher classes are being particularly considered for the project for the coming academic year because in reality, they are from deprived backgrounds and malnourished. “We have several girl students who specifically ask teachers for mid-day meals. Many students who come to   are discriminated against and are malnourished. Some also come from deprived backgrounds, and being a part of this programme will be good for them,” said Atishi Marlena, senior AAP leader. 
 
 The initiative comes at the heel of discovery of two dead rats in a mid-day meal served in a school in Deoli a few days ago. However, to ensure such incidents do not happen again, the government wants to introduce an app that will allow photographs to be uploaded, which can be tracked and   taken to task. The development of the app is in progress, officials said, and is expected to be ready for release soon.
