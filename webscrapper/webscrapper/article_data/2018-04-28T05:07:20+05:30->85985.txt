MUMBAI: Fire inside a passenger cabin is one of the most hazardous situations a cabin crew could encounter mid-air and it demands swift action. A cabin crew member dons a ‘protective breathing equipment’, or PBE , which is a hood with a transparent front built-in with canisters of compressed oxygen. The hood is donned and fastened around the neck within 15 seconds, after which it fills up with oxygen enabling the crew member to breathe when tackling the fire with an extinguisher.

 As with everything on-board an aircraft, there are rules for handling these equipment, and one of them states that inoperative PBE be removed from the aircraft. That is why low-cost airline GoAir is currently under investigation by the   as an A320 aircraft flew around the country for six days with an inoperative PBE on board. Every flight should carry one operative PBE per flight attendant and GoAir did not flout that rule. But A320 (VTWAJ) had an extra PBE that was inoperative.
 
 “It was found to be inoperative on April 8 in Bengaluru. But it continued to fly till April 14, though every commander who flew the said aircraft knew that the inoperative equipment was lying on board,” the source said. Among the routes the aircraft flew were the ones from the city to Delhi, Goa, Chandigarh, Kochi, Bengaluru and Lucknow. “Finally on April 14, it was removed. It was just callousness,” the source said.   spokesperson said:
 
 “The matter is being examined by the  . We are providing all assistance in their investigation.” The PBE has 15 minutes of supply of compressed aviator grade oxygen, said a source. Neither was the inoperative PBE removed nor was it handled in accordance with the   dangerous goods regulations, said the source. Asenior cabin crew member of an international airline said that an inoperative PBE could lead to confusion and delay the fire-fighting.
