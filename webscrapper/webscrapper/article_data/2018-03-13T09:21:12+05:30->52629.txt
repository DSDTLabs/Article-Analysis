CHANDIGARH: With Chandigarh Renewal Energy, Science and Technology Promotion Society (CREST) constantly urging the residents to install solar power plants on the rooftop of their houses, the residents have asked the administration to relax the building bye-laws relating to rooftop access. 

 As per the norms, 'mummity' is not allowed on the marla houses, while solar water heating system, solar photo voltaic power plant are allowed within the service zone. As per official figures, there are around 2.5 lakh houses in Chandigarh of which only around 10,000 are equal to or above 1 kanal.
 
 JS Gogia, general secretary of Federation of Sectors' Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC) said that the residents are facing problem in installing solar power plants due to stringent building bye-laws. He further said that the administration should not force people to get the solar system. "Installing solar power plants should be voluntary. The residents are facing problems in availing subsidy being offered by the administration. At present, the process of availing subsidy takes around 3 months," said Gogia. The Union government had selected Chandigarh to be developed as a 'model solar city' and set target of installing 50mw solar plants, both in residential and government buildings, by 2022. So far, Chandigarh has reached 13.5 mw mark. UT being a land locked city, residential buildings will be pivotal in achieving the target.
 
 CREST in 2016 had set May 18 as deadline for installing solar power plant on residential buildings. With deadline nearing, CREST has launched an aggressive campaign rising awareness among residents about the benefits of solar power plant. The Chandigarh administration is planning to initiate action against owners who have failed to comply with the directions.
