NEW DELHI: An opposition move for an impeachment motion against Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra received a significant boost with   appearing inclined to be part of the initiative that could set the stage for some fireworks during the Budget session of Parliament. 

 Party managers said there has been some coordination among a section of the opposition about bringing an impeachment motion against the   with Congress viewing seriously the issues raised by four senior-most judges of the apex court with regard to the manner in which cases were being allocated in the SC. 
 
 While Congress leaders said they haven’t yet decided on the proposal made public by   general secretary   and NCP’sTariq Anwar on Tuesday, they felt the matter cannot be brushed aside. According to sources, while the proposal is expected to gain momentum in the coming days, a formal decision on Congress’s course of action would be taken at a meeting of party managers that has been called for the weekend ahead of the Budget session that begins on January 29. 
 
 In a media interaction after the four SC judges held an unprecedented press conference against the CJI, Congress president   said there should a full and fair probe into the death of judge B H Loya, who was hearing the politically charged   “fake encounter” case. The senior judges had confirmed the allocation of the petition calling for a probe into allegedly “mysterious” circumstances surrounding judge Loya’s death was a point of contention with the CJI. 
 
 What is pushing Congress towards mulling joint action, a senior leader said, was the “absence of redressal” of the complaints voiced by four SC judges. While refusing to elaborate on the nature of redressal expected, a functionary said “we are disappointed”. 
 
 A source said the impeachment option was sealed on Monday evening after an “assessment of the situation” with the party veering to the view that the Modi government shouldn’t be let off the hook in a situation where allegations had been levelled with regard to a politically sensitive case.
