PANAJI: Goa chief minister   requested Portugal Prime Minister   to safeguard the welfare of the Goan diaspora that migrated using the   route. 

 “We have asked them that we have a diaspora of 50, 000 people, please take care of them,” Parsekar said.
 
 Thousands of Goans opted to surrender their Indian passports for Portuguese citizenship and moved to Britain. Following the BREXIT referendum for Britain to leave the European Union, thousands of Goans face an uncertain future.
 
 Under Portugal’s nationality law, anyone born before December 19, 1961 (the date of Goa’s liberation from Portugal) and the next three generations can acquire Portuguese nationality. Thousands of Goans have migrated and settled in Britain using this law. 
 
 “I feel we Goans should feel proud that a Goan origin person is the head of the country that ruled us for 450 years. It should be a matter of pride for all of us,” Parsekar said when asked how important Costa’s visit was to Goa and India.
