Panaji: Grocery bills have begun adding to citizens’ GST woes, none more than the humble tomato, which peaked at Rs 80 this weekend. 

 Shopkeepers and vendors attributed the rise to a shortage of supply and unfavourable weather conditions. 
 
 “Severe shortage of tomatoes has led our suppliers in Belagavi, Bengaluru, Mysuru, and Kolhapur to hike up prices,” said vendor Asif Nadaf. “Subsequently, retail rates in Goa have also gone up,” another vendor, Jaffar Mokashi, seconded him.
 
 “Rain has played spoilsport this time around, leading to the poor produce,” a vegetable seller, Sadiq Shaikh, said.
 
 Some vendors told TOI that people are tackling this inflation by buying fewer tomatoes.
 
 Some, like Porvorim-based Kishore Ohol, are refraining from buying them altogether. 
 
 “The tomatoes available in the market are not only overpriced but also of poor quality,” he said. “Many are small and unripe. I don’t think it’s worth buying them till rates normalize.” 
 
 Besides tomatoes, prices of carrots and beans, which shot up last month, also continue to remain severely inflated.
 
 “The market has still not recovered from the shortage of carrots and beans, thus leading to the continued price-rise,” said vendor Dawat Dhamani. “The situation doesn’t look any better for tomatoes either. The rates may further go up to Rs 100.”
