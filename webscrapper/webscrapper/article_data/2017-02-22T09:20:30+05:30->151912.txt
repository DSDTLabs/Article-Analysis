 Reports suggest that the actor will play a sub inspector in the movie and it would be a full-length entertainer. However, when we tried to reach out to the team, none confirmed nor denied the reports. Dulquer had earlier played an IPS officer in Vikramadityan but didn't don khaki for the role.
 
 The movie, which will go on floors on May, will also have   fame   as Dulquer’s romantic interest. Duqluer, meanwhile, is busy with Soubin Shahir’s Parava and will resume shooting for Bejoy Nambiar’s Solo from March.
