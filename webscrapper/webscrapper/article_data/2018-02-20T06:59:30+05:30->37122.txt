BATHINDA: Punjab local government minister   and state Congress president Sunil Jakhar held a mock prayer at the foundation stone of the sewerage system at Faridkot laid by then deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal nearly four years ago. Both Congress leaders scoffed at the   (SAD) chief for “only laying stones” and expressed hope that works, for which the previous government had laid stones but had not released money, would be completed now.

 Sidhu and Jakhar said the state government had sanctioned Rs 216 crore for sewerage system and water supply projects at Faridkot, Kotkapura and Jaito towns. The money would be released in a week and work on the projects would start soon, they said.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Sidhu said Sukhbir had laid the foundation stone for the sewerage on February 26, 2014 and had laid stones of 21 projects but no work was done on those projects. “Now the Congress government will complete these projects by March 2019 for which money has been sanctioned,” he said.
 
 Sidhu said the projects that he would start would be completed in time as loan to bear the costs had been secured from HUDCO. “We will never befool people,” said the minister.
 
  chief Jakhar said Sukhbir was blaming Sidhu for stalling the projects of the previous government so he should come forward to give their details. “The Congress government inherited a debt of over Rs 2 lakh crore and 500 gangsters. This government will come out of financial mess and will eliminate gangsters from Punjab,” he said.
 
 Both the leaders inspected the ongoing sewerage works at Faridkot, Kotkapura and Jaito. Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon accompanied them during the visit.
