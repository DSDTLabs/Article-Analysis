AHMEDABAD: In October 1926, textile magnate Ambalal   was faced with the problem of rabid dogs within his mill compound. There were 60 rabid dogs, and Sarabhai ordered all of them killed. 

 This raised a furore. Sarabhai approached Mahatma Gandhi at the   and explained his distress at having been forced to order the destruction of the dogs. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 Sarabhai told the Mahatma, “When the government, the municipality and the Mahajans all alike failed to guide me, I was driven to this course.” In his article in “Young India” published that month Gandhi wrote: “There can be no two opinions on the fact that Hinduism regards killing a living being as sinful. I think all religions are agreed on the principle...The difficulty comes when one proceeds to put it into practice…We recognize the duty of killing microbes by the use of disinfectants. It is violence and yet a duty…To destroy a rabid dog is to commit the minimum amount of violence. A recluse, who is living in a forest and is compassion incarnate, may not destroy a rabid dog. But a city-dweller who is responsible for the protection of lives under his care and who does not possess the virtues of the recluse, but is capable of destroying a rabid dog, is faced with a conflict of duties. If he kills the dog, he commits a sin. If he does not kill it, he commits a graver sin. So he prefers to commit the lesser one and save himself from the graver.”
