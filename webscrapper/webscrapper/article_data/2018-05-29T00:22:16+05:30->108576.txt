NEW DELHI: CBI is learnt to have closed its probe into the appointment of  , daughter of health minister Satyendra Jain, as an adviser to the   on its   project.

 According to top sources, the CBI has not found any concrete evidence to initiate criminal proceedings against Soumya.   and its leaders were accused by former lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung of “alleged nepotism, gross violation of rules and regulations and favouritism”.
 
 “The investigation officer recommended that there was not enough prosecutable evidence to suggest that she took benefits from her appointment, so there is no need to convert the preliminary enquiry into a regular case (FIR). A decision was taken to close it,” said an officer.
 
 After receiving a reference from Jung, the CBI had registered a PE in January 2017 to probe Soumya’s appointment as an adviser to the mission director,  , in the Delhi government to look into health sector reforms. 
 
 The then MD of the health department Tarun Seem and unknown officials of Delhi government were also named in the PE. A PE is the precursor to an FIR in the CBI. 
 
 During an enquiry, the agency determines if there is prima facie criminality requiring registration of an FIR.
 
 It was alleged that as per her application and biodata, Soumya didn’t seem to have any experience of the health sector as she was an architect.
 
 Also, it was alleged that her appointment was in response to her request and not as a result of selection through open and transparent process. It was alleged that Delhi government spent Rs 1.15 lakh on her tours. 
 
 TOI approached CBI for a comment but it refused.
