SALEM: Mettur MLA S   on Saturday said the AIADMK government led by   was likely to collapse at any time and also ruled out the possibility of merger of two factions.

 Semmalai, who was in the city to chair office-bearers meeting of AIADMK (Puratchithalaivi), said, “We have not taken any step to bring down the government. But the confusion prevailing among the ruling faction MLAs will cause its fall.”
 
 Semmalai said the ruling faction was afraid to conduct local body election, fearing defeat. He also said the EPS camp would no more succeed in breaking ranks of OPS supporters by threats, referring to the reports of Kavundampalayam MLA V C Arukutty’s plans to join AIADMK (Amma).
 
 He alleged that the EPS camp might have coerced Arukutty to switch sides by threatening to connect him to the Kodanad murder accused S Kanagraj’s accident case. “People in power might have threatened him,” Semmalai said and added that other OPS supporters won’t fall prey to EPS faction’s designs.
 
 Asked about actor Kamal Hassan’s allegations of corruption in the AIADMK government, Semmalai lauded him and said corruption was deep-rooted in the benami government of Sasikala. “The intolerance of ministers to the actor’s comments underlines it,” he said.
 
 Semmalai also unveiled OPS faction’s plans to press aggressively for an inquiry into the death of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa from August 5. “The movement will see members of EPS faction joining us,” he said.
 
 Former MLAs, mayor and deputy mayor of Salem Corporation participated in the meeting.
