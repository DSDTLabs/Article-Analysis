PATNA: The   (BSEB) on Thursday issued show-cause notices to two Hajipur-based schools –   and   – and also suspended their affiliation for allegedly fudging the age of students.

 BSEB sources said the matter came to light during matriculation exam in March when people complained about many over-age students appearing for the exam from these schools. Based on the complaints, BSEB chairman Anand   asked the   district magistrate to probe the matter, who, in turn, constituted a four-member committee.
 
 “During investigation, it was found that many students who appeared for the matriculation exam from these two schools this year were actually aged between 25 and 30 years, while the school registered these students with the board by decreasing their age to 14-16 years. Of course, there is no age limit for students to appear in board exam. But, it was fishy that many over-age students from these two schools appeared for matriculation exam,” said Kishor. 
 
 The BSEB chairman said he has asked the education officer of Vaishali to lodge an FIR against the principals of the schools and the fraud students. “The exam papers of these students would be cancelled and strict action would be taken against those who cheat the board. The school principals and students tamper date of birth entries for those who need it to get age benefits in appointments, promotion and retirement,” he said.
 
 Sources said during investigation it was found that some students, who had appeared in matriculation exam some years back, were again writing papers by manipulating their age.
