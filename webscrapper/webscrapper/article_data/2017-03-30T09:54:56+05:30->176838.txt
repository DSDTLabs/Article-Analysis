HYDERABAD: Children taking to Vincent’s Cursty (sitting with crossed legs) while watching TV or playing video games, run a higher risk of contracting urinary infections, warn city doctors. Pointing out how this problem peaks during the summers, they say that this modern day lifestyle issue is on a consistent rise — roughly 10 per cent every year — and in a few cases can even result in kidney failure.

 Vincent’s Cursty, colloquially known as ‘pee dance’, is a squatting posture that children in particular use to hold back their urine. 
 
 “This trend is fast increasing over the last five years as children (in age group between 5 and 10) avoid relieving themselves while watching TV or playing video games. It causes pressure on the bladder and intestine, ultimately leading to urinary infections,” said Dr  , urologist with Global Hospital. The problem initially manifests as constipation, but the underlining problem is not clearing the bladder, he added.
 
 Doctors say that number of kids being taken to hospitals with this problem has increased 10 times in the last five years. Among them 70 per cent develop urinary infections while the rest test positive for kidney infections. 
 
 “Children who use this technique are usually active and are called 'dysfunctional avoiders'. Parents should identify it in the initial days as in a rare 2 per cent case it can eventually lead to kidney failure,” Dr A V Ravi Kumar, urologist with   said.
 
 Elaborating on the behaviour of children he said, “They generally hold till the last minute to urinate and even when they do go they don’t clean the bladder completely,” adding, “It is important for parents to differentiate between wetting and this.”
 
 Urinary tract infections, doctors say, are mostly reported among young girls due to their anatomy, though children of both gender resort to  . 
 
 “However, infections caused due to this can be treated if identified early,” Dr G Jyothsna, a nephrologist said.
