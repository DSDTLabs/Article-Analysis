Home loans for buyers from the economically weaker sections will now come cheaper, with the PM announcing an interest subsidy for borrowers with an annual income of up to Rs 6 lakh. Beneficiaries would now receive a 4% interest subsidy on a loan of up to Rs 9 lakh, and 3% for a loan of up to Rs 12 lakh.

 This means that if a beneficiary takes a housing loan of up to Rs 9 lakh with an interest rate of 9%, their EMIs would be calculated 5%. If the loan is up to Rs 12 lakh and the interest rate 9%, the effective rate will be only 6%.
 
 According to quick calculations, the 4% subsidy on a loan of Rs 9 lakh would translate to a discount of Rs 1,98,300 on the principal amount. The EMIs on a loan taken for 15 years would come down from Rs 9,128 to Rs 7,117 . The government already provides a subsidy of 6.5%on home loans of up to Rs 6 lakh under the Prime Minister   (PMAY).
 
 National Housing Bank (NHB) managing director Sriram Kalyan Raman had told TOI that there was a great demand for loan from economically weaker sections. NHB is the nodal agency for disbursing the subsidy to borrowers through banks and non-banking financial companies under the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme.
 
 In Saturdayâ€™s address,   also said that the target for the number of houses to be built for the rural poor under PMAY had been enhanced by 33%. Furthermore, rural families who have a house but want to expand it would get a loan of up to 2 lakh with a 3% interest subsidy, he added. The government has rolled out a scheme to build one crore houses for the rural poor with an investment of Rs 81,975 crore by 2018-19. The government had initially targeted to build three crore houses, the target was reduced due to a fund crunch.
