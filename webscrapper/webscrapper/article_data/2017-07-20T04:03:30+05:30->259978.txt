MUMBAI: The   (BCI) has issued a show-cause notice to the   ( ), Churchgate, for not fulfilling the shortcomings in infrastructure and faculty requirement as was promised in an undertaking last year. In a letter to the  , principal of the college and the state, the BCI has said that the institute’s condition is ‘pitiable’ despite being one of the oldest running government colleges. The letter mentions that the college ‘would be producing sub-standard law graduates’ with these shortcomings.

 The observations in the letter are based on an inspection report submitted by a team, led by a retired HC judge, to the council’s legal education committee. The report says “there are shortages of infrastructure; neither moot court nor legal aid cell is made workable. There is no appointment of permanent principal and librarian on regular basis”. It also states that all social science faculty members at the five-year law course are working on clock-hour basis. And that the university and the college are not taking appropriate measures to upkeep legal education.
 
 Officials said GLC has most of the infrastructure, including a moot court and legal aid cell.  , vice-president of the council, said the inspection team is headed by a retired HC judge from another state and the standing committee is heading by a retired SC judge. “The team sends its report to the standing committee, which sends its decision to the legal education committee. Then the letters are sent to colleges with their deficiencies,” said Deshmukh.
 
 Last year, when the admission process was held up, the principal secretary of higher education gave an undertaking that all the shortcomings would be rectified in a year. But the condition remains the same, said the team. Similar notices will be issued to other government-aided colleges that have failed to meet the requirement in the past year.
