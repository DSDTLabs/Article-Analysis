HYDERABAD: Two Telugus are battling to get their respective parties elected to power in poll-bound Karnataka.   national general secretary Madhu Yashki Goud, who hails from Nizamabad, and   national general secretary  , who hails from Karimnagar, are pitted against each other to strategise plans to propel their parties to victory in the   polls to be held on May

 
 12. Both are Karnataka incharge for their respective parties.
 
 “There is no scope for a hung Assembly. The Congress will once again come to power in Karnataka,” Goud told the media, adding that the election is important as it will have a bearing on the 2019 general elections as well as the Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and   elections before that.
 
 Goud pointed out that out of the six crore population in Karnataka, Telugus account for one crore. “That is a significant number. All Telugu associations have decided to once again vote for the Congress,” he claimed in an interview to a TV channel.
 
 Goud was practising law in the US when he returned to contest the Lok Sabha elections from his home district Nizamabad. He got elected in 2004 and 2009, but lost in 2014 to K Kavitha of Telangana Rashtra Samithi.
 
 BJP’s P Muralidhar Rao hails from   in Karimnagar, but was educated in Warangal. Beginning as an AVBP leader, he joined BJP in 2009 as an ‘attache’ to party president Rajnath Singh. He worked his way up to become BJP general secretary in-charge of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
 
 Muralidhar Rao is confident that Telugus in Karnataka will reject Congress. “Can Telugu people ever forget Congress’ disgraceful behaviour towards them? Telugu people can never forget how they have been insulted, humiliated, neglected & used by Congress,” he said on Twitter. He said that the Congress was decimated in the Telugu states in 2014 due to its attitude.
