NEW DELHI: A case has been registered against a   BJP MLA for saying that an upcoming district poll in the state is a contest between a Hindu god and a Muslim god, or more specifically, between Ram and Allah.

 
 The case filed against him is under Sections 153 (a) and 505 (2) of the Indian Penal Code. The former Section is "promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion," and the latter deals with instances of "promoting enmity, hatred or ill will between communities".
 
 The MLA, Sunil Kumar from the Karkala seat, made this comment in a speech while referring to the upcoming election in  , where the main contestants are the   party's   and   candidate Rajesh Nayak.
 
 "This election is between Allah and Sri Rama. Let Hindus decide whether Allah or a friend of Sri Rama should win," said Kumar, advocating that people, or rather, Hindus, vote for Nayak.
 
 Kumar claimed that Rai had earlier said he won Bantwal with the blessings of Allah" six straight times. 
 
 "The MLA, elected from Bantwal for six terms, has said he won the election with the blessings of Allah. People need to decide who should win in Bantwal. Are you going to elect Allah again and again or choose a person who loves Rama? This is the issue - it's not between BJP and Congress," said the BJP's Kumar.
 
 The Congress party's Rai said elections should focus on issues to do with development.
 
 "The discussion should be focused on whether I've worked for the constituency. However, BJP has always been paving the way for radicals. He should not have spoken in this manner. What is the meaning of his statement? We believe in what Mahatma Gandhi believed in - 'Ishwar Allah Tere Naam...' Our Constitution mandates elections should be held without religious interference," said the Congress MLA.
