KOLKATA: Confusion and chaos reined during the peak evening hours at  , even as tram movement remained suspended in the area for the first time since its inception in the mid 19th century as the Mahakaran Station site was cordoned off on Thursday. Kolkata Police said there were some teething problems on the first day, but by Monday they would iron-out some issues.

 On Thursday, Kolkata Police banned movement of bus along   north, the road in front of the Writers' Buildings. Any bus violating the ban would be fined Rs 4,000. Instead of BBD Bag north, the vehicles will now move along   and then turn right to   to move forward along Old Court House Street.
 
 The ban has put tremendous pressure on India Exchange Place Road and Brabourne Road. During the evening peak hours, the dispersal from Dalhousie was slower than other days. “It was because commuters were confused about where they would get their buses from. According to a sergeant, minibuses coming stra ight on the carriageway instead of the terminus clogged the road. “It took me nearly half an hour to figure out the place from where I could catch the bus,“ said Amrita Sinha, an employee with a nationalised insurance firm.
 
 
 
 
 Some amount of disruption is expected when there is a big infrastructure project happening on the ground. But care should be taken to ensure that the citizen's pain is kept to the minimum. Time-bound completion of this phase of work will also help.
