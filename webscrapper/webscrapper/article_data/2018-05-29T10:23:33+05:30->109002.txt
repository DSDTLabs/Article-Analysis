HYDERABAD: Senior IAS officer  , Shubham Goel, was shot dead in a robbery attempt in Istanbul, Turkey. The body was brought back to India and the last rites performed on Sunday in Uttarakhand.

 
 The incident took place on May 24. Shanshank Goel who is a principal secretary-rank officer in Telangana, rushed to Delhi on coming to know of the incident, according to official sources in the Secretariat.
 
 With help from the Union external affairs ministry, the body was brought to India. The last rites were performed in Roorkee, Uttarakhand on May 27 as the family hails from there. The 24-year-old Shubham Goel, a software engineer, was employed in the US as deputy manager with the Federal Bank of America in California and had come to India to attend the wedding of a relative.
 
 On his way back to California, he planned a trip to Turkey. It is learnt that in Instanbul when he was on a sight-seeing trip with a group, Shubham and a friend were confronted by a group of thugs. They threatened them and demanded that they hand over their money and belongings to them.
 
 When Shubham reportedly tried to resist and not give in to the demand immediately, he was attacked with a knife and also shot dead. Shubhamâ€™s father, Shanshank Goel, a 1990-batch IAS officer, is principal secretary, labour, employment, factories and training. When his office was contacted at the Telangana secretariat, they said the officer had gone to Delhi but could not confirm anything about the incident. However, the local media in Uttarakhand reported the incident.
