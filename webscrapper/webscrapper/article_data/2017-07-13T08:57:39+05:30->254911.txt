AHMEDABAD: World heritage status to Ahmedabad’s walled city comes with huges responsibilities, to ensure adequate funds for conservation and preservation of listed private and institution-owned buildings. A total of 2,696 buildings are listed in the dossier, of which 449 buildings fall in the non-residential category.

 Last Saturday, the Unesco thinkthank,   on Monuments and Sites ( ICOMOS), had clearly stated that the   (AMC) should have a conservation plan and ensure that funds are available for repair of dilapidating wooden havelis.
 
 Senior AMC officials pin their hopes on the sale of trade-able Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) certificates to owners of heritage properties—which translates to the trade of allotted floor space index (FSI) to builders outside the walled city limits. For some 2,690 structures, the funds generated from TDR sale will be around Rs 430 to Rs 470 crore according to some estimates. On average, a Unesco listed property —a haveli or institution building — is about 100 sq m, and its jantri rate works out to average of Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 per square metre, depending on the ward it is in. 
 
 The reality is that just six   have been issued since February 2016, while those for the remaining properties are yet to be allotted. Many TDR certificates are stuck because of the absence of a fast-track mechanism in the AMC. 
 
 Sources in the AMC claim that a fully-functional special purpose vehicle (SPV) called the   will be established, at the Law Garden civic centre, which will help speed up the process.
 
 “The idea of the 2013 TDR policy was that the state government had increased FSI limits for residential R1 zones to 2.7 and R2 to 1.8 and up to 4 for affordable   and along BRTS and metro corridors. Builders in these zones will demand extra FSI, that walled city residents hold. This has to be put on the fast track,” says a senior AMC official.
