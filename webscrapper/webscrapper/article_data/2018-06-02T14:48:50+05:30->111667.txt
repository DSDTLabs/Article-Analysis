SURAT: Though the inaugural Bengaluru-Surat Airbus flight of budget carrier   India received an overwhelming response from Surti passengers with booking to its capacity on Friday, the official ceremony was a low-key affair following the Malaysia-based airline’s Group CEO Tony Fernandes facing corruption charges. 

 
 Fernandes was booked couple of days ago by the   ( ) for allegedly trying to manipulate government policies through corrupt means to get international licence for its Indian venture   India Limited.
 
 AirAsia India officials from Bengaluru had arrived at Surat airport to receive the inaugural flight from Bengaluru on Friday evening. 
 
 Sources said AirAsia India officials were not so keen on celebrating the inaugural flight to Surat as their group CEO is facing inquiry from CBI.
 
 The inaugural flight landed at Surat airport at 6.15 pm and was accorded with the water cannon salute. The Airbus A320 departed from Surat airport with more than 175 passengers to Bengaluru. 
 
 Activist   said, “The Surtis are happy on the air connectivity to Bengaluru, but Air Asia India officials seemingly maintained it as a low-key affair. We are happy that Air Asia has recognized the potential of the Diamond City and will add more destinations in the coming months, irrespective of the inquiry being faced by its CEO.”
