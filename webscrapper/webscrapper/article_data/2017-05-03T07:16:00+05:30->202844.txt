GHAZIABAD: A fire that broke out in the   box of   Preschool in Sector 5, Vasundhara, around 10.30am on Tuesday was put out by the the school’s security staff before the arrival of the firemen.

 The minor fire was triggered by overloading because of multiple electrical appliances in use.
 
 About 72 kids, all under three years, who were present in the school at the time of the fire, were safely evacuated by the firefighters and the school’s guards.
 
 The fire brigade was informed around 10.48am, but by the time the fire brigade arrived, the flames were doused by three fire extinguishers in the school. “The parents, who live in the neighbourhood and had their kids studying in the school, panicked. A crowd of about 60 people had gathered outside the school at the time of the incident,” said a fire department official.
 
 “It’s summertime and too much load on the electrical wiring system leads to overheating that can lead to such incidents. The   emanating from the meter box got really dense. Even though the school was equipped with fire extinguishers to combat the blaze, the presence of really young kids made it a touch-and-go affair. However, the situation was brought under control really soon,” said Ramesh Chand, a parent.
 
 The school is currently operating from a building in a residential society, with the owner living on the second floor of the building.
