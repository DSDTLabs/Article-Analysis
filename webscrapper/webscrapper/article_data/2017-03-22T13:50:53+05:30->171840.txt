NAGPUR: After prodding by chief minister   and Union transport minister  , the   (NMC) has done a U-turn and decided to pay its   to Nagpur   project. 

 In a statement, municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said NMC’s total share in the Rs8,680 crore project was Rs434 crore. Of this, Rs361 crore was in the form of land and remaining Rs73 crore cash. The civic chief said funds for the mega project would be arranged as the project progresses. The process to hand over land to NMRCL has already begun after NMC general body approval. However, the civic chief has not proposed even a single rupee towards NMC’s contribution to the Metro Rail project in the 2017-18 budget presented recently.
 
 Earlier, the BJP-ruled NMC had refused to pay cash, and instead maintained that its contribution should be recovered from transfer of land to Nagpur Metro rail project. Dayashankar Tiwari, then ruling party leader in NMC, had justified the civic body’s stand. “It was not that we had taken the stand suddenly. NMC general body had passed a resolution stating NMC will provide its share of the project in the form of land,” he had said. 
 
 NIT is paying its share in cash. Its land component amounts to Rs434 crore and cash Rs78 crore. So far, NIT has paid Rs48 crore cash.
 
 On Tuesday, Tiwari said the civic body had never stated it would not contribute its cash share. “In fact, we thought that value of land would be enough to meet our share,” he said. He still said that though civic chief had mentioned paying NMC’s contribution in cash, the stretch of land in Orange City Street to be acquired for the project may be enough to pay their share.
