The 23rd episode of the game show began with the rollover contestant,  , who continued his game from question #6.
 
 The host,  , was bowled over by the confidence that the contestant exuded. The Delhi-based Arun Singh Rana tackled all the questions with well-reasoned answers. His well-thought-out approach towards the questions that were posed was appreciated by Big B. Mr. Bachchan, who also held the view that the younger generation can seek inspiration from Mr. Rana's views. 
  
 The two of them also exchanged thoughts on the importance of sports in the overall development of kids in general. Arun passed the second milestone of the game with ease. He secured the minimum prize money of 3,20,000 with ease. His wife was seen cheering for him from the audience's arena. It was very heart-warming to see such display of affection.
 
 On the 12th question, Arun picked his Jodidaar lifeline. After he and his wife couldn't settle on an answer, due to their different opinions on the question, he used t 
  wo more lifelines - 50:50 and the audience poll.
  
 On the 13th question, Arun used another of his lifeline - phone a friend - and with the aid of that, he won Rs. 25 lakh. 
  
 Then Mr. Bachchan called Arun's grandfather, who became emotionally overwhelmed on learning about Arun's progress in the show. Arun threw in the towel at question #14 and took home Rs. 25,00,000. However, if he would have answered that question he would have walked away with a sum of Rs. 50,00,000. Arun expressed the desire to open a sports and fitness bar with the prize money.
  
 Post Arun's exit, Amitabh Bachchan conducted a fresh round of Fastest-finger-first and that brought a new contestant,  , on the hot seat. She will kick-start her game tonight. Stay tuned in for more updates!
