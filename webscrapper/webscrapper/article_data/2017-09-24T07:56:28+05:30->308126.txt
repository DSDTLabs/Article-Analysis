NEW DELHI: An assistant   of Delhi University’s   is facing flak following a   he posted on September 22, which allegedly had   on goddess Durga. 

 The alleged remark has earned the ire of BJP’s student wing,   (ABVP), which is demanding immediate suspension of the teacher, even as a complaint was lodged against him by other teachers of the college.
 
 Kedar Mandal, an assistant professor of Hindi at Dyal Singh College, had allegedly updated his Facebook status where he used derogatory language for goddess Durga. Following this, Mandal’s colleagues, who are also members of the right-wing teacher’s body NDTF, filed a complaint against him at the Lodhi Road police station.
 
 In the complaint letter, the teachers have accused him of “making a mischievous attempt to hurt people’s feelings” and demanded strict action against him. Speaking to TOI, one of the complainants, VS Negi, general secretary of NDTF, said that “this is a disgusting attempt at cheap publicity especially at a time when everyone is revelling in the festivities of Navratri”.
 
 Negi said that he was informed of the post in the morning and was “disgusted by it. We then decided that a police complaint should be made for there is a need to put a stop to such people.”
 
 A senior officer said police were probing the matter.
 
 While the alleged post has been removed from his Facebook page, the ABVP has called for his “immediate suspension”. Accusing the teacher of hurting sentiments, the student outfit said that “he may not believe in Hindu mythology, but nobody gives him the right to disrespect.”
 
 Despite several attempts to contact him, Mandal was not available for a comment.
