Noida   ( ) has set a budget of Rs 5,533 crore for the project that will connect Greater Noida with the rest of NCR. The Aqua line, as this corridor has been named, starts at Sector 71 in Noida and will have an interface with the Blue line extension that Delhi Metro is building from Noida City Centre to Sector 62. The special purpose vehicle to execute the   project was set up in November 2014.
 
 In January, the National Capital Regional Planning Board had approved the release of Rs 1,587 crore as financial aid to the Metro corridor at a subsidised interest rate.
 
 Since the change of government in Uttar Pradesh from the Samajwadi Party to BJP, the Centre has fast-tracked approvals for the corridor, which has already set several records for pace of construction.
