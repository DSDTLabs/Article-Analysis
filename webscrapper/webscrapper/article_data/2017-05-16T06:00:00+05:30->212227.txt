Visakhapatnam: As ‘Win with the Times’ campaign entered the second week, the enthusiasm among commuters knew no bounds as they got awards from the cops for following traffic rules. On Monday morning, around 200 two-wheeler and four-wheeler riders at Kurmannapalem Junction and Urvashi Junction on the National Highway were in for a pleasant surprise as they received gifts from the traffic department. Those spotted with the Times of India and following traffic rules were selected for the gifts. Among the lucky ones was P Satyanarayana, a GVMC employee. “I felt good at receiving the gifts. I always wear helmet when I ride my two-wheeler. It’s a good initiative from The Times of India to encourage people to follow traffic rules,” he said. Another commuter from Kurmannapalem Junction was PT Naidu, a steel plant employee. “It’s good to generate public awareness through distribution of pamphlets, insisting on wearing helmets and seat belts. I feel happy to get the gifts for following traffic rules,” said Naidu. At the Kurmannapalem Junction, traffic department CI T Laxmi and traffic SI Jagga Rao were present on Monday. Organised by The Times of India, the campaign is supported by the city traffic police and Vizag RTA departments and would be held at various junctions in the city till May 26 from Monday to Friday, between 8.30 am and 10 am. On Tuesday, ‘Win with the Times’ will be held at Scindia Junction and Isukathota Junction.
