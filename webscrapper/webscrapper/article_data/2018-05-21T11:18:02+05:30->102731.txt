TIRUNELVELI: The district police have launched a crackdown on illegal   in the wake of the murder of special branch police constable S Jegadish Durai, by illegal sand miners at Parappadi near   last week. During the special drives conducted over the last four days, the police have arrested more than 50 people.

 The district police has formed special teams to check   who are engaged in regular night patrolling.
 
 Superintendent of police of   district P Ve Arunsakthikumar said that during the course of interrogation with the arrested, they came to know that the illegal trade is taking place in four phases. “There are informers or escorts, sand miners, brokers and also buyers who are involved in the chain,” he said.
 
 Informers are fishermen or pretend to be fishermen in the water bodies and keep a watch on police movement. “They inform the illegal miners about police movement and whether they should stop or resume illegal mining. There are brokers who regularly buy the sand and send it to buyers. All the stages are offensive,” he added.
 
 Among the people who have been arrested so far, at least five are brokers. “We are preparing a list of brokers engaged in illegal sand mining. We are gathering details through persons who have been booked for illegal sand mining in the past. Illegal miners are engaged in the act because there is demand for sand,” the SP said.
 
 Arunsakthikumar said that over the years, the focus shifted on miners who were at times also the traders. He added that there was not much focus on the brokers and buyers. For this reason they are planning to arrest brokers and also initiate legal action against the buyers. Some buyers are unaware that they are buying illegally mined sand. But there are buyers who prefer this sand and they are the ones who will be booked by the police.
