A 16-year-old girl out to attend a Dandiya event in   was allegedly raped and bludgeoned to death by a youth and his cousin after she rejected the former's advances.

 Police said on Friday the two had been apprehended.
 
 The deceased had gone to participate in   festivities at a pandal near her house on Wednesday night but did not return home, Anantpura police officer Anil   said.
 
 Her half-naked body was found on Thursday morning in   by a passerby who informed police, the officer added.
 
 The accused, aged 17 years, are cousins.
 
 One of them had proposed to the girl, but after she rejected his advances he went to her house and threatened her family members and also broke some window panes there, Joshi said.
 
 He then left the town and only returned a few days ago. On Wednesday, the accused saw her with another youth during the festivities and later took her to an isolated spot on some pretext.
 
 The two then stuffed her mouth with a cloth to stifle her cries and bludgeoned her to death with a heavy stone after raping her, he said.
 
 The youths were produced before the   Justice Board late on Thursday night, and were sent to a children's detention home.
 
 The girl's body was handed over to her family after the autopsy, he said.
