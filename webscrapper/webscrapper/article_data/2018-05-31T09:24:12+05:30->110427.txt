LUCKNOW: Monsoon arrived early this year in India and if it continues to proceed at its current speed, the currents may touch UP by   and cover the entire state by the last week of June. 

 
 
 This year monsoon arrived in Kerala three days ahead of June 1, the normal date of arrival set by the Met department. The normal dates for arrival in UP and Lucknow are June 15 and 18, respectively. It covers entire UP by June 25. 
 
 
 
 
 According to Met officials, the monsoon has so far covered entire Kerala and many parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The conditions are favourable for further advancement of monsoon into northeastern states by Friday.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 Indian monsoon is a complex weather phenomenon and hard to predict. In the past 10 years, monsoon arrived on normal dates in UP and Lucknow only twice — in 2008 and 2013. But weather office is hopeful that the monsoon currents will reach UP on time this year. 
 
 State Met director JP Gupta said the advancement of monsoon majorly depends on two factors — cyclonic circulations formed over the Bay of Bengal due to low pressure area, and cyclonic circulations generated over the Gangetic plain by hot weather conditions. These circulations push monsoon currents deep into the plains.
