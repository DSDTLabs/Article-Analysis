Surat: The   (SMC) has been installing 11 types of fitness equipment in over 100 of its total 170 gardens in the city for sometime now. These equipment have been procured at a cost of Rs 3.11 crore for use by common people, who visit the gardens for rejuvenation and relaxation. 

 “Three years ago the idea germinated with us to   in   for the good of common people,” executive engineer, SMC,   said. The equipment so far have been installed in 40 gardens and the condition of majority of them is good. The equipment do need some maintenance.
 
 Few people in city can afford membership charges of private gymnasiums. “We thought if basic equipment like walker, hip twister, shoulder spinner, abdomen bender and walking barrel are installed in gardens, it would benefit a large number of people,” said Jariwala adding that besides these, aero rider, forearm spinner, lung extension, abdomen board, leg lift station and chest press, too, are being installed. 
 
 “We made it sure during procurement that the supplier would maintain the equipment for at least three years. Use of such apparatuses is very high in some gardens like   and Piplod. People in large numbers visit these gardens. Use of such equipment is low in SMIMER hospital’s garden because people here come for a different purpose,” a civic officer said.
