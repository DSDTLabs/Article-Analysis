PUNE: The   ( ), the state’s economic survey says, has managed only a slight reduction in the number of bus-related accidents in 2016-17 when compared to 2015-16. However, the corporation has paid more in compensation.

 The transport body, to encourage better driving practices, has decided to double the incentive given to bus drivers who manage to go the entire year without an accident. Currently, a cash reward of Rs 1,000 is given to a driver if he avoids on-duty road accidents for six months. If the driver does the same for a full year, Rs 5000 is given to him. “With better incentives for safe driving, the drivers will be more encouraged. Though the final decision is yet to be taken, we are planning to double the incentive amounts,” an MSRTC official from Mumbai said. He added, “The MSRTC takes care of the buses’ maintenance and frequently trains the drivers. However, to avoid accidents, the drivers need to be more careful and there should be greater stress on the technical aspects.”
  
  
 
 “The economic survey shows there has been an increase in the ‘compenation paid’ amount. This is mainly because, in April 2016, MSRTC had decided to increase the compensation given to the family of victims killed in an accident from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. Whenever an accident takes place, apart from an investigation, the driver is called in for a counselling-cum-training session,” the official said.
 
 On January 28, two men were killed after being hit by the engine maintenance door of a Shivneri bus. More recently, in Nashik, one of the wheels of an MSRTC bus came off and at least 20 passengers were injured. In  , a bus caught fire and the passengers had to be evacuated.
