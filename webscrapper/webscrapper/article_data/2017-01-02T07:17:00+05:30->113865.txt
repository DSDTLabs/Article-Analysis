NAGPUR: At its three-day joint meeting of board of trustees and management committee council that concluded on Saturday, the   ( ) passed four resolutions that seem to have been influenced by the impending elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and three other states in early 2017.

 Most importantly, it passed a resolution demanding uniform common civil code in the country at the earliest. Surendra Jain, VHP joint general secretary who proposed the resolution, told reporters here that Muslim Personal Law Board’s threat that it would never allow outlawing of triple talaq was deplorable. “Some fundamentalist Muslim bodies have threatened direct action and riots if the laws relating to their community were changed. The VHP is ready to counter such threats,” said Jain.
 
 He said that the failure to have a common civil code was an insult to the Constitution and its authors who had talked about ‘one nation one law’. Citing recent violence in West Bengal and other parts of country, Jain added that lack of a uniform law posed a serious threat to the unity and strength of the nation and encouraged fundamentalists.
 
 Among the three other resolution passed, one stressed on expanding activities of the   like trishul dharan, maha-aarti of Hanuman in every village and city. The third resolution was for celebrating ‘Ram Utsav’ from March 28 (Gudi Padwa) to Ram Navami (April 10). The move was aimed at keeping the Ram temple issue alive by mobilizing support of nearly 5 crore people. The last resolution was on month-long functions in January to pay tributes to   founder   and spread his teachings. The Sikh Guru had called for countering attacks on Hindus, said Jain.
