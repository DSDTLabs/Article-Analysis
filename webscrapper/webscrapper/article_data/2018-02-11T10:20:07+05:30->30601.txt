DEHRADUN: Parents, grandparents and teachers converged at an innovative workshop on Saturday to “relearn the fine art of storytelling.” In the workshop organised by a city-based school, participants were taught how they can explain concepts better to kids and bond more with them through interesting rendition of tales.
 
   , founder of Bengaluru-based Storywallahs, who conducted the day-long workshop along with his associate  , said that “story-telling is so much more important nowadays when the relationship among children, teachers and parents has withered due to increasing availability of technology-driven options at the disposal of children.” “While children are still receptive to listening stories, parents and teachers have to be also prepared to tell them. That is where storytelling training comes in play.” He added that “stories not only help in improving a child’s imagination but also help build a robust vocabulary that leads to overall personality development.”
  
  Participants at the workshop said that they were curious about the role that storytelling can play in building better relationships between children and adults. “We have a ten-year-old grand-daughter. We wanted to see if there is any difference in modern age story-narrating vis-a-vis our times. We would love to learn new things for the sake of our granddaughter’s balanced upbringing,” said  ,68.
  
   , principal of Shikshankur - The  , which had organised the workshop, said, “We wanted to revive the age-old method of building a bond between children and parents through verbal storytelling which is almost on the verge of extinction. Through these initiatives, we hope that such time-tested practices which aid in bringing up a child holistically, are revived.”
