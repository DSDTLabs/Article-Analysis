SANGRUR: he district which had registered a case against ASI of the government railway police, Didar Singh, for outraging the modesty of an   girl, was today arrested by the Dirba police.

 Confirming the development, SSP M S Sidhu said after conducting a preliminary inquiry, a case under relevant sections of the law was registered against the ASI at Dirba police station on Monday and as a fallout of this the accused ASI was arrested.
 
 The issues of the cop hurling abuses at the Sikh girl and also using foul language with other passenger travelling in a   bus from   to Patran had even been raised by Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh, who in a statement had demanded strict action against the accused.   chief Kirpal Singh Badungar had also shown concerns and offered legal and other help to Sandeep Kaur, the girl with whom the cop had misbehaved.
 
 The cop had later been thrashed by one Jaswinder Singh, with whom he had got into a scuffle on board the bus after he had objected to his questioning of the religious symbols worn by the girl. In the video of cop- thrashing, which went viral across all social networking platforms, Jaswinder had publically accused the ASI of commenting at the religious symbols of the girl and told her that Kirpans and Kacaherras (worn by the baptised Sikhs) were removed by them in police stations.
 
 The Sangrur police had registered a case under Section 354 (outraging a woman's modesty and 295 A (Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings) of the IPC against the ASI who is posted at Sangrur. The matter was taken up by the   police with the Sangrur SSP as the incident of misbehaving with the girl had occurred in latterâ€™s jurisdiction.
 
 Meanwhile, some of the Sikh organisation which had taken up the cause and had even visited the Patran police station seeking action against the accused cop hailed the development asserting that exemplary punishment should be given men in uniform who use their position to harass commoners.
