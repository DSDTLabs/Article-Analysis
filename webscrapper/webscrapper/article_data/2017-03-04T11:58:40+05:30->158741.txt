PATNA: Despite railways running around 24 pairs of  , Bihar-bound passengers from Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune, Secunderabad, Chennai and other major cities of the country are finding it difficult to get confirmed berths. Holi will be celebrated on March 13 this year.

 A   official said efforts were being made to accommodate passengers in different  . “We have already introduced 24 pairs of special trains to clear rush of passengers during Holi,” he said, adding railways is working on a plan to run identical trains on crowded routes to provide confirmed berths to the waitlisted passengers.
 
 According to sources, an effort was made to provide confirmed tickets to passengers in all classes when   was the railway minister in UPA government. “Talks in this connection were held between railway ministry and Railway Board officials. However, the plan could not materialise due to frequent changes in the railway ministry. The   government, it seems, is serious to give a thought to this proposal,” said a railway official.
 
 The Board had agreed in principle to run identical trains to clear rush of passengers during peak seasons. However, since both passenger and goods trains run on same tracks on several routes, particularly on the New Delhi-Mughalsarai-Patna and Mumbai-Patna routes, many opposed the idea of running identical trains on already congested routes, sources said. 
 
 An ECR official, however, said introduction of identical trains would come as a relief for passengers. The most crowded routes in Bihar are Patna-Delhi, Patna-Pune, Patna-Mumbai, Patna-Chennai-Bangalore, Patna-Howrah and Patna-Cochin-Thiruvananthapuram. “It is difficult to get confirmed tickets on these routes throughout the year,” the official added.
