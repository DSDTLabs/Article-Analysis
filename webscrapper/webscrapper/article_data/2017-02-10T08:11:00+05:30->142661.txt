NAGPUR: Taking a dig at private coaching institutes, Mahatma Gandhi International Hindi University, Wardha, vice-chancellor   on Thursday said just like black money, black education was thriving in the country.

 “Why is education in colleges and universities not good enough to enable students qualify for IITs? Why is so much money being spent on taking coaching? Just like black money, black education has spread across the country,” Misra said.
 
 He was addressing teachers and lecturers during a one-day conference on ‘Perennial Indian Education System: The Past, Present and Future” jointly organized by Indira Gandhi National Open University (Ignou), Bharatiya Shikshan Mandal (BSM) and PG department of Education of Nagpur University.
 
 Misra said, “A lot of aspirants who have failed to join IAS have opened coaching centres for civil services exam. Formal education has become just a formality. Earlier, the concept of coaching or tuition was not there. It started when teachers stopped teaching in the class and began offering private coaching at home for Rs 500.”
 
 He said education was a process and an interactive event between a student and teacher. “My father was a teacher and a pandit. Students used to come with questions to him even at night and he used to work with them. I also saw a few needy students being served dinner at home,” he said.
 
 Misra added educational process involved exploring new questions. “India has a rich tradition of knowledge. But that was deliberately taken away from us and we were handed over a foreign tradition. Now, we are neither here nor there.”
 
 Besides Misra, Ignou regional director P Sivaswaroop, BSM’s  , head of PG education department Rajashree Vaishnav were present. Later, vice-chancellor of Kavikulguru Kalidas Sanskrit University Uma Vaidya and vice-chancellor of GH Raisoni University at   attended the valedictory function.
