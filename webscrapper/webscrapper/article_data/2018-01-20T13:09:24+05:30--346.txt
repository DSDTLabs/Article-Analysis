MARGAO: There was no major impact from the strike called by tourist taxi operators at the   railway station on Friday morning, as yellow-black taxis, auto rickshaws and motorcycle taxis were plying normally. The police and officials from the directorate of transport maintained a watch throughout the day.

 The state government had arranged Kadamba transport corporation (KTC) buses to ferry tourists to the Margao KTC bus stand. While no private tourist taxis could be seen at the station, mini-buses belonging to the Goa tourism department, besides private tour buses were transporting tourists to the railway station. 
 
 Assistant director of transport Sandeep Dessai told mediapersons, “The situation is peaceful and normal. There are no problems faced by passengers at the railway station as arrangements of KTC buses have been made by authorities.”
 
 Meanwhile, KTC also made provisions for direct buses to Calangute for travellers who arrived at the Vasco railway station on Friday. “A majority of the passengers who arrive at the station are those living and working in the state and not tourists, so they weren't affected by the strike,” PC Chacko station manager said. An official from KTC was stationed outside the railway station to lead passengers to buses available. Buses were provided for around 100 people to travel to North Goa. 
 
 Those going to the airport were asked to board KTC buses headed for Margao buses, which stopped on the way for passengers to alight at the airport.   SP   told TOI, “Till 6pm, no untoward incident had been reported.” Colva PI   and Canacona PI Rajendra Prabhudessai said that no complaints were registered in their police stations.
