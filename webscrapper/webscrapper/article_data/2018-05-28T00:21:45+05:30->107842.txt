NEW DELHI:   Anil Baijal’s congratulatory tweet to students of Class XII for an outstanding performance in the Board examinations prompted   Arvind Kejriwal to take on the LG for the recent sacking of deputy CM Manish Sisodia’s advisor  .

 “So, you agree that Delhi government is doing great work in education? Who benefitted when you removed Atishi Marlena? If you stop creating obstacles, wonders could be achieved in many sectors. It will make you also proud. Please support our efforts. Let’s be positive. Please do not create hurdles in everything,” Kejriwal tweeted.
 
 Including Marlena, 10 advisors of the government were sacked for “not obtaining prior approval” of competent authority before their appointment.
 
 LG had on Saturday tweeted: “Heartiest congratulations to all our students of Class XII and their parents for their outstanding performance. Sincere thanks to their teachers. Would advise to follow your dreams with sincerity, dedication and hard work.”
