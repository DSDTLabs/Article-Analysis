Anant Waghmare, PMPML general manager (operations) said, “Earlier, we had decided to replace the passes with the cards from April 1. However, the infrastructure required was not ready. A grace period of a month has now been provided to the people carrying bus passes. However, from May 1, the passes will be invalid,“ Waghmare said.

 The transport utility issues daily, monthly and yearly bus passes, although not many people take yearly passes. On an average, 30,000 daily bus passes, each costing Rs50, are issued. In all, 11 kinds of passes are issued by the transport body in different categories, like students, retirees, and people with special needs among others. “We are setting up data and printing centres for the MI cards; all the bus pass centres will be converted into MI card centres by the end of April. Pass-holders or those looking to get MI cards will have to go to any of the pass centres, and give one photograph and their details -names, identity proof, residential address - which will be fed into the system. Once the pass centres have the data, it will be sent to the Pune and   municipal corporations for verification,“ an official said.
 
 Commuters, while welcoming the move, said the PMPML had already delayed things.
 
 “In almost all its projects, the PMPML delays the execution. They should have planned things quickly so that the deadline was not missed. Even now, they should plan things correctly so it doesn't cause confusion,“  , a daily commuter, said.
