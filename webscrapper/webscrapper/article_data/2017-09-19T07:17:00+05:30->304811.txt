Karwar: Yashwant Raikar, a picnicker from  , was believed to have been swept away in the flash floods at Nagaramadi falls near  , along with six others, on Sunday. The last-minute struggle by the group was filmed by a   and the video went viral. Hours after Raikar’s family too, was certain he had died, the youth emerged alive, with a story to tell. 

 “My wife Ashwini was preparing chicken kebabs near the falls. The water level suddenly increased. When I noticed the rising water, I realised the danger. A young boy who was running to escape the flood fell down. I pulled him to safety and he escaped. But I fell down and was washed away,” Yashwant said. A day after the tragedy, it emerged that six people had been swept away. Five bodies have been recovered while the search is on for the sixth person. 
 
 “I thought I would die, but didn’t give up. I was washed downstream for about 2km and felt nervous and weak. By chance, I caught hold of a tree branch and held on to it. After some time, the water level receded and I came out of the stream and fell unconscious. Some people from a search party arrived there and shifted me to hospital,” Yashwant said. 
 
 When the water level went up, the picnickers climbed on a boulder under the falls to escape the gushing water. Within a few seconds, a person, Raikar, was seen washed away. Six others on the boulder fell in the stream and were swept away too. “Though I know how to swim, it was very difficult in the flowing water. I slammed against boulders and tree branches,” said Yashwant.
 
 Yashwant said his family members and friends told him that almost all news channels in Goa and Karwar had shown him being washed away and declared him dead. “I’m alive,” he smiled, adding, “I never thought the picnic would cost us so dearly. It was a nightmare and I’ll never forget those moments,” he said.
