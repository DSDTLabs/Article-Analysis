NEW DELHI:   launched a   in and around   on Monday night, a day after the   election results were announced. 

 Students were seen roaming around the Jamia area and cleaning up the Okhla Road that runs through the university. They got help from the police for cleaning the papers.
 
 “The winners of the   elections created a ruckus as they moved around the campus and entered residential areas of Jamia Nagar and other localities on the night the results were announced. Along with the noise, the littering of the area was the main problem,” said a resident.
 
 A Jamia law student, Sahil Ahmed, said, “It is our duty to make our campus and country clean. If our elders did something wrong, then it is the responsibility of the younger generation to sort things out.” He added that the students were motivated as the posters and pamphlets had the logo of Jamia, which includes a line from the Holy Quran.
 
 Another student criticised the actions of the candidates and the winners. “The amount of money spent on wasted paper could have been for better things,” said Jawed Malik, another student who helped in the cleaning drive.
