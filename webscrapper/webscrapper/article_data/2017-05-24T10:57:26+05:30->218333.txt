AGRA: An audio tape of BJP   from   in Etah district, Satyapal Singh Rathore, in which he is seen asking a villager to go to an MP of the latter's own caste for development, has been widely distributed online. "Your MP did development work only for people of his own caste. I will also do this. You can go to him," the MLA is heard saying in the audio clip. 

 When Ram Avtar from Dhakpura village told the MLA about the poor condition of roads and school infrastructure in his area, the lawmaker asked him to approach MP   (also from BJP) for help. However, when the villager emphasised that he had voted for the MLA in the recent assembly elections, the latter said that he hadn't done any favour to him. 
 
 "You are talking as if you are behind my victory and that if you hadn't asked people, they wouldn't have voted for me. Ask your MP. Don't ask me. I will look after my caste. Your MP has not spent a single rupee on other castes in the past three years," Singh is heard saying in the tape. 
 
 When contacted, the MLA said, "The audio clip has been tampered with and the context is missing. The tape is two months old and there is no animosity between me and the MP."
