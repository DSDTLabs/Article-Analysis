BELAGAVI: The pornographic pictures posted to a   by   (BJP) on Tuesday evening were much discussed across the district.

 The two-time MLC posted 50 nude pictures of porn stars at 4.17pm to the   group, which includes several senior politicians, government officials and journalists. Many sharply commented on the post while some questioned the morality of politicians. Within minutes of the post, group administrator Mahaboob Makandar removed Kavatagimath from the group.
 
 Makandar said he has known Kavatagimath as a decent politician for a long time. “I don’t know how the pictures were posted to the group. But, I immediately removed him from the group,” he said.
 
 When asked about his culpability as the group admin, Makandar said he couldn’t be held responsible for someone else’s mistake. The question of offence arises when somebody’s image is damaged intentionally after posting of objectionable material. Besides, a police complaint needs to be registered by the person whose image has been damaged. In this case, nobody was maligned, he said.
 
 Kavatagimath, a follower of   member Prabhakar Kore, is known to be a decent, soft-spoken politician. He is a director of the prestigious   and is associated with several educational and financial institutions. He kept his cellphone switched off after he started getting calls by other members in the group and the news was broadcast by the electronic media.
