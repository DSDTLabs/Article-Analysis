Ludhiana: In view of the annual exams of students, Ludhiana deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Kumar Agrawal has asked all the managers of all religious places to limit the sound of loudspeakers up to the boundary walls so that students preparing for exams are not affected. Further, the marriage palaces have also been ordered to restrict the volume of DJs during the functions. 

 The deputy commissioner gave the reference of the letter issued by Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) chairman Kahan Singh Pannu in which he had asked all the deputy commissioners (DCs), senior superintendents of police (SSPs) and three commissioners of police (CPs) to take concrete steps for strictly implementing these orders in their areas. 
 
 Agrawal also mentioned about the edict passed by Sri Akal Takht Sahib on November 23, 2005 in which it had ordered all the management committees of the gurdwaras that no one can use loudspeakers to cause inconvenience to the public and they should limit sound of loudspeakers up to the premises of the gurdwaras or place where the religious function is being held.
 
 He has also instructed the officials to hold meetings with the committees of all religious places for convincing them to keep the sound of loudspeakers within their premises.
