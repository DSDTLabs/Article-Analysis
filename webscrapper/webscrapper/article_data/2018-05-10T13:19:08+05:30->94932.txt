NAGPUR: Around 25 students of   (CIIMC), accompanied by NSUI activists, on Wednesday lodged an FIR against college director Sunil Mishra with the Ganeshpeth police station.

 They stated that Mishra had collected exam fees and other charges from them, and told them that he had deposited those with Nagpur University’s (NU) exam section. Mishra had also taken their original marksheets of Class X and XII during admission, and was now refusing to give them back, the FIR says. The students alleged that Mishra threatened and abused them when they went to demand their marksheets.
 
 On the basis of the complaint by third-year Bachelor of Fashion Designing (BFD) students of CIIMC, the cops have booked Mishra under Section 505 and 506 for criminal intimidation.
 
 On Monday, the students had approached vice chancellor SP Kane, complaining that Mishra held back their original educational certificates and also collected exam fees from them. The NU had expressed helplessness in allowing students to appear in the exam, since Mishra’s authority to verify the exam forms as head was withdrawn, and he didn’t deposit the fee with the exam section. 
 
 Mishra refuted the allegations and claimed that the NSUI activists were intimidating him at the behest of top NU officials, against whom he has filed court cases.
 
 In March, the Ganeshpeth police had booked Mishra after a three-member inquiry panel led by retired judge BC Chandrikapure of   (NU), and a cop was allegedly roughed up by him during the committee’s visit to CIIMC to investigate students’ complaints.
