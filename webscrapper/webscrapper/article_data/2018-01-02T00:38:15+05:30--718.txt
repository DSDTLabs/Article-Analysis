Trichy: Even after three months, the wait seems to be never ending for an ad hoc temporary guest faculty appointed to the Tamil department at the Perambalur government Arts College as he is yet to be formally inducted as a teaching faculty. For the last three months, M Siva Kumar, 38, guest lecturer, has been going to the college like any other teacher. But, instead of taking classes, he spent the whole day in the library and returns home. This has been his routine for the last 3 months as he was asked by the college administration to wait until he is allotted classes by the respective head of the department. Siva Kumar is a victim of the cold war between the college administration and the head of Tamil department M Anbazhagan. The college administration had made appointment based on recommendations from M Manjula, director of Collegiate Education (DCE), but without consulting the respective head of the department. M Anbazhagan who heads the Tamil department refused to budge terming Siva Kumar’s appointment illegal. “I spent about a month under the tree in the college ground. Later I was asked to sit in the library but never allowed to take classes,” says Siva Kumar, who has not been paid from the last 3 months. He was working at a government college in Ariyalur for the last 5 years. After appointment as a regular faculty at the college, he was asked to join the government Arts College at Veppanthattai.  “I have no option but to sit in the college in the hope that differences would vanish one day and I would be allowed to take classes. If I leave, I may not able to get this job again,” says Siva Kumar.
