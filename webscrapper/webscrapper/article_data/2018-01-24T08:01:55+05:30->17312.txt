NEW DELHI: As Prime Minister Narendra Modi hogged the headlines from the   summit, Congress president   reiterated his argument that the BJP government was working only for the rich.

 “Dear PM, welcome to Switzerland! Please tell Davos why 1% of India’s population gets 73% of its wealth. I’m attaching a report for your ready reference,” Rahul tweeted.
 
 He was referring to an Oxfam survey, which said 1% of Indians had cornered 73% of the nation’s wealth. Congress spokesman Anand Sharma said it was a pity that the PM chose “to speak to the rich about the rich” when the World Economic Forum chief himself spoke about 1% controlling 73% wealth.
 
 “He could not take a cue from the WEF head. It shows that it was a rehearsed speech made just for effect,” Sharma said, adding, “It is a matter of serious concern.” Upping the ante, the deputy leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha questioned the PM’s lecture to the global community about the need to create an inclusive society when “there are deepening divisions in India under Modi’s watch”.
 
 “Merely quoting Gandhi and Tagore to the world will not bring about the healing touch that India needs. The PM should practice at home what he has preached abroad,” Sharma said. The jibe aimed to magnify Modi’s participation in a summit that is widely seen as a gathering of big business.
