CHANDIGARH: Throwing norms to the wind, the liquor vends of the city are not issuing invoices on the sale of liquor. This is despite the fact that the excise and taxation department in its excise policy, which came into force from April 1, had made issuance of bill on the sale of liquor mandatory. 

 The department incorporated this clause in the policy after   and   high court on March 8 had issued directions to make bills mandatory for the sale of liquor in Punjab and Haryana. The court had issued the direction after a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a city-based road safety activist,  . The move is aimed at regulating the sale of liquor.
 
 In Chandigarh, there are a total of 89 liquor vends. It was observed that, no vend was issuing bills to its customers. Over the years, the excise and taxation department has also failed to put a check on traders selling liquor on prescribed selling price. 
 
 With little check, every liquor shop now has its own selling price. The department fixes the minimum selling price (MSP), but the majority of the shops do not adhere to the rate.
 
 Wine Merchants Association's president   said issuing bill on sale is practically difficult. "Liquor vends have a high footfall and it becomes difficult to issue bills on every sale during rush hours," he added. 
 
 He, however, said that the traders will abide by the policy and will start issuing bills to all the customers.
 
 To ensure that the traders abide by the minimum retail sale price, the department in its policy has also introduced a penalty. For first violation, a trader will be fined Rs 1 lakh and Rs 2 lakh for subsequent violations.
 
 Talking to the TOI, the UT assistant excise and taxation commissioner   said a meeting was held with the traders in which they were directed to start issuing bills on every sale. 
 
 "We will start conducting surprise checks to ensure that the laid down norms are being followed," said Chaudhary.
