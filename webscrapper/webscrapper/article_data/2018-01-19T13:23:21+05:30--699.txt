NAGPUR: The decision of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory   (MERC) to take away the powers of its two members of hearing fresh cases has been stayed by the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court. The order was passed by the HC while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Suhas Khandekar on behalf of   ( ). The next hearing will be held two weeks later.

 MERC presently comprises chairman Anand Kulkarni and two members Deepak Lad and  . The Commission had passed a resolution on December 15, 2017, taking away the powers of Lad and Khan of hearing fresh cases from January 1, 2018. Only Kulkarni would hear them while the two members would assist the chairman in hearing pending cases. This was a strange and unprecedented decision and was opposed by all consumer organizations including the   (VIA).
 
 MVGS counsel Anil Kilor told the HC that the decision had been taken by the Commission under pressure from state government and was against the interests of consumers. He also charged that there were serious differences between the chairman and the two members.
 
 In exercise of powers conferred by Section 181 of Indian Electricity Act, 2003, the Commission framed the MERC (Conduct of Business) Regulations, 2004. Regulation 29 states, ‘The bench of the Commission shall consist of the full strength of the Commission, including the chairperson, unless otherwise required under the Act. Provided that the Commission may, direct that specific matters or issues be heard and decided by a bench constituted by less than the full strength of the Commission.’
 
 Using this regulation, MERC passed a resolution disempowering Lad and Khan from hearing fresh cases. Kilor contended that what was to be meant for specific cases was made a general rule, which was untenable and illegal. HC then quashed this resolution and fixed the next hearing after two weeks.
