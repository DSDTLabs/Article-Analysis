AHMEDABAD: Recent comparative product testing by city-based   ( ), found traces of pesticides and heavy metals in six supposedly-organic brands of rice. 

 Three brands of rice sold as organic had traces of the pesticide chlorpyrifos, and these were above the safe limit in two brands. All seven organic rice brands tested by CERC, were found to have heavy metals, copper and lead, but these were within the safe limits.
 
 Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry ( ) suggests that short-term exposure to chlorpyrifos can cause changes in behavior or sleeping patterns, mood changes, and effects on the nerves and/or muscles in the limbs.
 
 Contrary to the findings, the packaging of most products carried claims such as ‘pesticide-free’, ‘free from chemicals and toxic substances’, among others, which are misleading, the study concluded. 
 
 “The very rationale for buying an organic product is to buy a product free of pesticides and chemicals. Moreover, consumers pay a premium for organic products and despite this, they don’t get the proper quality. This is because there are no standards to govern the production and sale of organic food products,” said Pritee Shah, chief general manager, CERC.
 
 In the past, CERC urged the   and the   to formulate standards for organic products through a representation. 
 
 CERC further emphasized that the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) certification be made mandatory for organic products and not just processes.
 
 “Currently, NPOP certifies organic process standards; but it should also certify the final product. While we do encourage promoting consumption of organic products, manufacturers and regulatory authorities must ensure that consumers get quality products. India also needs to follow labelling norms according to global best-practices in the interest of consumers,” added Shah.
