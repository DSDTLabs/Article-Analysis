 Q:
 
 
 A: I simply discharged my constitutional duties in the interest of the state and citizens. Guarding the constitution is my responsibility and I would continue to do so.
 
 Q:
 
 A: I feel, the way I stood firmly in rejecting tainted names from the list drawn up by the then Samajwadi Party government for the Legislative Council, was one such decision. I succeeded in making the government follow the letter and spirit of the Constitution. I feel satisfied that I could change the past tradition of putting stamp of approval on decisions of the state government without scrutinising them according to constitutional norms. Another big decision was to stand my ground firmly on the appointment of Lokayukta. Both the decisions were unprecedented.
 
 Q: 
 
 
 A: I seldom respond to political charges made on the Raj Bhawan. But, on a few occasions, I sought clarification from senior leader of the Samajwadi party, Ram Gopal Yadav and he regretted making these his accusations.
 
 Q:
 
 
 A: Everybody knows that if Azam Khan criticizes someone, it is seen as a certificate of honesty and integrity.
 
 Q:
 
 
 A: To assess his performance, we need to give Aditya Nath Yogi at least six months. In the first three months, Yogi has shown determination and commitment to take long term decisions. The adage, well begun is half done, applies to him. I still have cordial relations with Akhilesh Yadav. But he had to pay a heavy price when I pointed out certain anomalies and he ignored. For example, when I asked for a White Paper in the Jawahar Bagh massacre case, he did not respond. There are many such decisions.
 
 I recall an anecdote while talking about Akhilesh. While addressing a meeting of young leaders of his party, Akhilesh asked them to read my book ‘Charaiveti, Chairaveti’, especially the part where I had written that despite my loss to actor Govinda during a Lok Sabha election, I did not stop my struggle and public welfare work in my constituency.
 
 Q: 
 
 
 A: I would reiterate that the new chief minister should be given at least six months to perform, before being put under scrutiny.
 
 Q:
 
 
 A: I have no regrets. Rather, I am more than happy that my colleague, who has worked with me in my committees in the party, has been elevated to the highest position. I never ask for anything, just keep working with honesty and sincerity for the nation and for the welfare of the people.
 
 Q: 
 
 
 A: When I came to Raj Bhawan here three years ago, I had dreamt of turning Uttar Pradesh into “uttam pradesh.” Now, in the days to come, I want to see it as “sarvottam Pradesh” (the best state in the country).
