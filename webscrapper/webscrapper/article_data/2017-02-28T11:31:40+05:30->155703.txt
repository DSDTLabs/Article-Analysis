INDORE: With an aim to keep a check on   (PUC) centres in the city,   has planned to develop software that will connect all   with its online server. However, a final decision in this regard is yet to be taken. 

 Officials with transport department said that there were complaints regarding irregularities in issuance of   certificates. “We have been receiving complaints against some PUC centres. It has come to our notice that some centres issue PUC certificates without conducting any test,” regional transport officer MP Singh told TOI.
 
 If any centre will be found flouting the procedure for checking vehicle exhaust emission based pollution, it will be shut down, he added.
 
 Elaborating about the software, Singh said that all PUC centres will be connected with an online server of RTO office. Authorities can take help of Smart-Chip, a private agency, which handles most of the online work of the RTO. “The system is already followed in states like Delhi and Karnataka. It will eradicate reported mismanagement in the PUC centres operational in the city, said an official.
