Earlier, our students had to wait for at least three months for get text books from the NCERT after academic sessions started."

 The new textbooks with colourful pictures of festivals like Sarhul, tribal hero Birsa Munda, sports personalities like MS Dhoni, Deepika Kumari, tribal revolutionaries, important heritage sites and temples like Maluti temples have developed enthusiasm and interest among students.
