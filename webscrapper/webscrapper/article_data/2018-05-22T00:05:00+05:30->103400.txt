Director Prataya Saha’s latest video, titled Sweet Dreams, is a melancholic song with elements of dark, goth subculture and a touch of  , as he describes it. Though originally performed by British band Eurythmics, the song was later popularized by   in 1995.

  However, Prataya’s take on the song is different. “We have tried to portray the evils of child or female prostitution through the video. So many children and women are abducted on a daily basis across the world. We have tried to address that issue with symbolic representation through the costume design in our video,” says Prataya.
 
  But what prompted him to take up such a project? “Tanushree (Saha), who has lent her voice in the video, asked me if we could do something like this. This is the first time that I’ve done a  . I wanted to do something with a story-telling aspect to it and which is women-centric in nature. So, I said yes. I took my time to understand the lyrics and the music and what they were trying to portray,” says Prataya, adding, “We wanted the video to have a dark ending. It depicts the true nature of how women and children get entangled into the vicious circle of prostitution, and how they are unable to get out of it.”
 
  The video, however, has been inspired by several characters, says the director. “One of the characters has a bright red costume in the video, which is inspired from the film Sucker Punch, whereas the horror aspect has been inspired by Marilyn Manson,” he says.
 
  So, what should the audience look out for in the video? “One of the most important things is the way the entire video has been shot. It’s been shot in a surreal and cinematic manner. It’s a bold step for the indie-film community. It shows the maturity of the filmmakers from this community. We all know the kind of struggle the indie community has due to a lack of funds. We hope that this music video will change that,” Prataya sums up.
