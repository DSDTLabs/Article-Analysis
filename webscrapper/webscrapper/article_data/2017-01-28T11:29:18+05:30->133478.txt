SURAT: Next time you visit the watering hole in the  , it may be difficult to get liquor and beer there. 

 Central excise in Daman has issued   in view of   judgement that   along national and state highways and ordered removal of signages that advertise liquor brands. The licences of bar and wine shops along the highways will be cancelled from April 1, 2017. 
 
 Sources said the Supreme Court’s judgement will affect more than 80 per cent of wine shops, including those selling liquor in hotels, restaurants and bars. Most of these shops are located within 500 metre of the national, state and coastal highways in Daman. 
 
 The central excise notices issued recently say prohibition now extends to the stretches of the highways which fall within the limits of municipal corporation, city town or any other local authorities. The licences renewed prior to the date of the Supreme Court order shall continue until it expires but not later than April 1, 2017. 
 
 All the signages and advertisements about availability of liquor will be prohibited and existing ones removed forthwith from national and state highways. No shop selling liquor would be visible from a national or state highway directly accessible within a distance of 500 metre of the outer edge.
 
 Wine shop owners said the Supreme Court’s judgement will affect more than 80 per cent of wine shops, bars, restaurants and hotels. 
 
 “There are over 500 wine shops in Daman and majority of them will be affected due to the order. This will result in huge unemployment of people associated with the industry,” said wine shop owner, Pramod Tandel. 
 
 Tandel added, “If the judgement is followed strictly then tourists visiting Daman will not be able to get liquor. Daman is spread in just 74 square kilometre area and surrounded by national, state and coastal highways. We had met the administrator to find a solution to this and will soon file a review petition in the Supreme Court.”
