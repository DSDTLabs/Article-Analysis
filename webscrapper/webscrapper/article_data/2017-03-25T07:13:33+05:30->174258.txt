CHANDIGARH: Oman has urged Haryana to share its expertise in agriculture, health, poultry farming, and skill development, and has invited entrepreneurs from the state to set up their ventures in the Middle Eastern country.

 Salim Taman al Mashani, the chairman of Oman-based company   (ICT), called on Haryana chief minister   on Friday to discuss avenues for mutual cooperation.
 
 The CM directed officers concerned to identify agriculture products which can be directly exported to Oman on minimum support price (MSP). He also directed the officials to prepare a list of agriculture projects in demand in Oman, so that they could be exported. He directed them to find out key areas in which skill-development courses could be started so as to generate employment opportunities for youth of Haryana in Oman.
 
 Salim said there was a lot of demand for maize, corn and sugar in Oman for human consumption, and also to cater to the needs of the poultry sector. “Haryana can meet that demand by exporting these commodities. There is a huge requirement for skilled manpower in Oman in the areas of mining, shipping, petro-chemicals, marketing and office staff. Haryana can prepare a trained workforce by providing them skill training as per the industry needs in Oman. Oman and India have a long association of more than 6,000 years and people of Indian community are respected a lot in our country,” he said.
 
 Salim informed that abundance of groundwater is available in north and southern parts of Oman. “There is a lot of potential in agriculture. Entrepreneurs from Haryana can set up agro-industries to promote agriculture and allied sectors. Oman is looking forward to entrepreneurs to set up downstream industries in Ammonia. Oil-related companies and those engaged in mining, limestone, gypsum, marble and petro-chemicals are among the major industries of Oman,” he said.
