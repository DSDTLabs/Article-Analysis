JAIPUR: Taking a strong exception to the support pledged to   in the byelection by   and Rajput Sabha, panchayati raj and rural development minister   on Sunday advised them that social organisations shouldn't engage in politics. “They should focus on social welfare of the community rather than politics. If they focus on politics their image is bound to suffer,” said Rathore.

 Both the outfits have pledged support to the Congress in order to teach   a lesson as the party has not put a nationwide ban on the controversial film ‘Padmavat’. The outfits have put pressure on the BJP by supporting Congress candidates in Ajmer, Alwar and state assembly polls in Mandalgarh. Rathore added, “Every community has people active in politics and in the social sector. They should follow the roles assigned to them.”
 
 He asked the Rajput community that Congress party is against the community as they have not given ticket to Bhanwar Jitendra Singh to contest from Alwar. “Rajput community should teach a lesson to Congress in bypolls. The community will never forget the injustice committed by the Congress on Rajputs,” said Rathore.
 
 He also asked the community leaders that BJP has fulfilled all the promises made to the community during the Anandpal episode.
