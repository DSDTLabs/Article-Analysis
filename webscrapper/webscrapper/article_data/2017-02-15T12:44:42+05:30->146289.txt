PATNA: All, it seems, is not well in the ruling   as the verbal spat between two major allies – CM Nitish Kumar’s JD (U) and Lalu Prasad’s RJD – continued on Tuesday despite RJD chief’s instruction to his party members not to comment anything in public about the functioning of the government. 

 Within hours of Lalu’s instruction, senior party functionary and former Union minister   raised questions on competence of officers posted by Nitish government. 
 
 Earlier in the day, Lalu had asked his party men to directly meet him and discuss problems, if any, in the functioning of the state government. “I have noticed that many party men, including MLAs, speak in public on functioning of the government which is not a good sign. If the party men have any problem, they should come and talk to me,” Lalu said. 
 
 On Monday, Surendra Yadav, RJD MLA from Belaganj in Gaya district, had said, “In Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, a young leader, has been ruling successfully as CM for five years. Time has come now for a young leader from our state, such as Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, to become CM.” He had also said that the RJD would support the candidature of Nitish as PM in 2019 Lok Sabha election. 
 
 Raghuvansh, who has been regularly hitting Nitish government on different issues, including JD (U)’s support to demonetisation and job scam, came down heavily on the CM for “not appointing right officer at right place”. “The government has failed to appoint right person at right place and this has led to scams,” said Raghuvansh within hours of Lalu’s gag order. 
 
 The suggestion of RJD functionaries, however, did not go down well with the JD (U) members. JD (U) spokesman   said the way RJD functionaries are airing their grievances in public is against coalition dharma.
 
 Another JD (U) MLC,  , said, “This is not a good indication for the alliance. Unwanted statements must stop immediately,” said Singh.
