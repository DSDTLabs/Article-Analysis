MUMBAI: Unscruplous   drivers continue to fleece unaware tourists at the Mumbai airports. 

 The   tell passengers that there is a “prepaid auto service” at the   and ask for   receipt. When commuters show ignorance, they offer to ply them for a fixed charge to avoid queuing up.
 
 In the latest incident, a Mulund resident Anmol Bhushan, who landed at the domestic airport on February 7, said, “When I came out of the arrival terminal, an autodriver approached me and offered to take me to Mulund for a lower fare. He said the rate at regular auto stand was Rs 480 and he will charge a fixed amount of only Rs 400.” Bhushan got into the vehicle which dropped him ahead of Western Express Highway in front of another auto and the driver said that the other auto will take him to his destination at the charge agreed upon. 
 
 Bhushan sensed foul play and he found out there was nothing like a “prepaid auto service” at the airport. He noted down the auto registration number and filed a written complaint with the airport police, a copy of which is with TOI. It was also learnt that the normal fare to Mulund would come around Rs 250, while he was being charged Rs 400. 
 
 Commuters alleged that drivers did not have the fear of the law and seemed to be in cahoots with the local traffic police.
 
 Activists have taken up the issue with the joint commissioner (traffic) and senior RTO officials in the past, but in vain. “When we had complained to the police last year, it had stopped for about a week. But now again errant drivers continue to operate with impunity,” alleged activist Dolphy D’souza.
