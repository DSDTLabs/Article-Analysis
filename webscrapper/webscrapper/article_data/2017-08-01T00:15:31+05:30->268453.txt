MUMBAI: The opposition disrupted the state council on Tuesday objecting to former prime minister   being referred in connection with the   in   for Class IX.

 “Rajiv Gandhi was acquitted by the courts. He cannot be called a Bofors accused or connected with Bofors. This is defamatory,” said Congress MLC Sanjay Dutt. He also said Gandhi’s contributions, especially in the IT field, had not been adequately acknowledged. 
 
 The Opposition also said the textbook devoted more space to criticizing former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for her role in the Emergency rather than acknowledging her contributions. 
 
 In response, education minister Vinod Tawde said that the state government would refer these concerns to the committee on textbooks headed by academic Sadanand More. “We do not interfere with or try to influence the committee that writes textbooks,” Tawde said. He also said that the history text for Class IX was only up to 2000 while Rajiv Gandhi was acquitted in the Bofors case in 2004.
 
 The Opposition said that Indira Gandhi’s contribution on the international stage or the India-Pakistan was not adequately acknowledged in the textbook. “Even the Opposition praised her during war but the textbook does not make enough mention of this,” said MLC Kapil Patil. The Opposition also said the book wrongly said the Sikh community asked for the formation of Khalistan.
