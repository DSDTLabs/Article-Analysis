Ludhiana: Putting rest to the ongoing controversy over the three Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETP) whose work has been stalled due to non payment of its share by the Punjab government, the initial amount of Rs 23 crore has been sanctioned by the state government on Wednesday for the Bahadurke Road CETP. A confirmation in this regard was given by deputy commissioner, Ludhiana Pardeep Agarwal. Recently cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had drawn flak from businessmen and opposition parties on his announcement of Rs 130 crore for CETPs of Ludhiana, but the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) denied receiving any intimation. 

 Meanwhile sharing more information on the issue, Agarwal said, “There are about 260 textile dyeing industries in Ludhiana and all these industries have installed their individual effluent treatment plants but in order to monitor the pollution load of effluent of these industries at a single outlet, there was a proposal to install three CETPs with capacity of 50 MLD, 40 MLD and 15 MLD, respectively for clusters of dyeing industries at Tajpur Road and Rahon Road, Focal Point and Bahadurke Road.” And he added, “These projects are being set up at a cost of Rs 135 crore. For the installation of 15 MLD CETPs costing Rs 23 crore, the state government has already sanctioned the amount and work shall start in October, 2017. The other two CETP projects of 40 MLD and 50 MLD, have already been sanctioned and work is likely to be completed next year.
 
 Agrawal also stated that the Punjab government is making all efforts to complete these projects at the earliest. He stated that with the installation of these projects, water pollution in Budha Nallah will be controlled to a large extent.
