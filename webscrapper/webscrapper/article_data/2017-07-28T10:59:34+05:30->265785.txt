 Excerpts:

 
 
 Bihar BJP had nothing to do with the rift in Grand Alliance. It was at a recent meeting of BJP legislature party that at least 27 of 29 BJP MLAs favoured Nitish’s return to NDA. As the central leadership of our party had asked us to assess the mood of legislators, we conveyed to them that conditions are conducive to join hands with JD(U). 
 
 
 
 The alliance is unconditional. 
 
 
 
 No alliance is ever made on bond paper and nobody can guarantee the continuation of a political alliance. The end of Grand Alliance was inevitable because it was an unnatural alliance and Nitish also has anti-Congress component in his blood. However, our alliance is going to be completely stable.
 
 
 
 Nitish-NaMo combine will create miracles in the state and this alliance will sweep Lok Sabha elections in 2019. Chemistry between Nitish and   on issues of corruption and good governance would foster rapid development in Bihar. 
 
 
 
 We were never against any projects of Nitish government. BJP was only opposed to the mode of execution of government schemes. In fact, we always appreciated Nitish’s clear stand on his ideology, transparency and good governance. It’s for the first time in Bihar since 1990 that same alliance is at the Centre as well as in the state. 
 
 
 
 Deliberations would be held on all such issues. As NDA is committed to development of Bihar, the state can get more than what it is expecting from special status. 
 
 
 
 Decision on distribution of ministerial berths will be taken after vote of confidence on Friday. Several MLAs of RJD and Congress are in touch with us, but we don’t require their support as we already have 132 MLAs with us.
