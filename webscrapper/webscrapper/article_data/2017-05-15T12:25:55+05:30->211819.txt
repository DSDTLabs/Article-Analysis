   has become one of the most popular faces on small screen after a winning spree on the reality shows he participated in. The actor, who has also been seen on the fiction show Badho Bahu, recently took a dig at co-judge  's acting career.
 
  He’s a hot headed guy and speaks his mind out and we all have had a taste of it on MTV   Rising. One such instance of Prince’s reckless behaviour was seen on MTV   when his gang was fighting for immunity against Neha and Nikhil’s gang. 
  
  Fights on Roadies is nothing new, and the gang leaders too are a part of it now. They have been fighting tooth and nail and to our surprise.
  
  
 
  
  Three gangs were seen fighting for immunity where   and Nikhil’s gangs ganged up against Neha’s gang. After the task for immunity was over, Neha Dhupia said, “There is one team, I really hope doesn’t make it and I know which team it is! I have got my fingers crossed, that one team really loses today.”
  
  Prince pretty well knew that Neha’s comments were targeted at him. An annoyed Neha sarcastically said, “Prince you have won Roadies, Splitsvilla and Bigg Boss and you know how to strategize” , to which Prince’s response took the entire crew by surprise where he said, “I know the work I have done. I am happy about the fact that people have at least seen the work I have done”.
  
  A shocked Neha replied, “I think I can maintain my respect by not indulging in conversations with him right now.”
