GURUGRAM: Around 100-150   owners and employees protested on Monday morning in front of the mini-secretariat in Gurugram. 

 The shop owners, mainly from the Jacobpura area of Gurugram, where around 25-30 meat shops operate. allege that some ‘anti-social elements’ are trying to disrupt the meat business in the area because the shops are close to a Ravidas temple. 
 
 According to the meat shop owners, most of whom don’t have licences, the shops have been in the area for more than 80 years, much before the temple came up .
 
 Pritam Singh, president of the Meat Shop Owners association in Jacobpura said the temple is being used as a motive to evict the shop owners. MCG commissioner   said it is primarily the residents who are objecting to the meat shops in the area. He said the various factors will be considered while taking a decision on providing licenses. He said it is a matter of rights, between the residents and the shop owners,
