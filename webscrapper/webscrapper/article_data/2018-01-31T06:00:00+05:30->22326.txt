KOLKATA: The   on Tuesday directed police not to arrest BJP leader   in relation to a complaint over the death of his political mentor, Mrinal  , in January 2015.

 Roy, who was then a   MP, was directed by the court to cooperate and appear before the investigating officer as and when asked. The HC directed the state to produce all medical records relating to the treatment of Singha Roy and his death certificate on February 14, the next date of hearing. Roy had moved for anticipatory bail before a division bench of justices   and Rajarshi Bharadwaj. 
 
 Appearing for Roy, his lawyer Asish Sanyal said Singha Roy had met with an accident in 2011 and died in 2015. The FIR against Roy, he said, was the worst kind of political vendetta. State additional advocate general Abhrotosh Majumdar said: “The FIR in this case was lodged by the orders of a magistrate under 156(3) CrPC. Police didn’t lodge any FIR on their own and were merely abiding court orders. How than this be a political vendetta, then?” The court passed orders insulating Roy from any arrest till February 14.
 
 Singha Roy had allegedly met with a road accident on June 8, 2011 around midnight while returning home at Kanchrapara from Halisahar. Singha Roy’s sister Sonali alleged that he was shifted to a Kolkata hospital and, then, was kept in a lodge under instructions of Roy instead of being taken home after his release.
