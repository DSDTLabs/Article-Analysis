BENGALURU: The   ( ) hearing the   case on Wednesday directed the government to submit a step-wise time-bound plan that includes removal of silt, blocking entry points of untreated sewage, cleaning of the waterbody and upgrading sewage treatment plants (STPs). The plan must be presented at the next hearing on Monday, it said. 

 At the hearing,   (BDA) commissioner   claimed the fire that ravaged Bellandur Lake on January 19 was a result of ‘mischievous activities’.
 
 Raging through heaps of garbage and dry grass, the fire started at 10am on January 19 and was doused after 30 hours — around 4.30pm on January 20. Gutting nearly 40 acres of the 910 acre waterbody, it took the collective effort of the fire force and Army personnel to bring the flames under control.
 
 Refuting the BDA’s claim, Namma Bengaluru Foundation’s (NBF) counsel displayed photographs that show the froth in the lake catching fire on previous occasions. Indicating that the government was contradicting itself, NBF said when the lake had caught fire in the past, the government had said that it was caused due to the flow of untreated sewage.
 
 Sridhar Pabbisetty, CEO, NBF said, “The BDA commissioner’s story about arson causing the fire couldn’t stop NGT’s ire towards the agency. The reason for the fire’s long duration and intensity needs to be scientifically established and communicated to all Bengalureans”.
