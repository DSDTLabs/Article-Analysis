While the mornings were all about breakfast in bed, working out with a team of trainers and enjoying the view of the desert from their palatial rooms, the evenings were to be enjoyed over naach-gaana while spirits and conversations flowed. That's what Delhi-based filmmaker-entrepreneur  's three-day wedding to restaurateur   in  's spectacular Emirates Palace was all about.

  
  
 Cousin   who arrived in the Middle Eastern country on Saturday morning, set the dance floor on fire, shaking a leg with the groom, Akshay's brother   and Sanjay and  's son, Jahaan to 'Saturday Saturday'. Then, he coaxed Akshay to groove with his bride and had the guests cheering and whistling.
 
  and her girl gang, including sister, Rhea, designer-friend Shehla Khan and hotelier Samyukta Nair, put up an act for the newly-weds, while   was a picture of elegance in a grey kurta-churidaar. Surprisingly, the choron ka raja and his roop ki rani, sister-in-law   had chosen the same colours and posed for pictures complimenting each other perfectly. Also present were close friends of the groom, Kunal Rawal, Siddhant Kapoor and Jackky Bhagnani.
