Indore: A woman was booked for allegedly feeding her father-in-law mercury in small quantities thereby causing damage to his health in Goyal Nagar area, Tilak Nagar police said on Monday.

 The matter was reported when husband of the accused got suspicious of her intentions and got his father tested for heavy metal poisoning at a private laboratory.
 
 Health of the victim, Vinod Kumar Shrivastava, a retired bank employee, had started deteriorating in last couple of months, prompting his son Amit, to get his blood tested for heavy metals.
 
 The tests revealed high levels of mercury, Tilak Nagar police station in-charge Soma Malik told TOI.
 
 “We have booked Amit’s wife Bhavana Pandey for causing hurt by poisoning,” she said.
 
 Bhavana and Amit had a love marriage some years ago and have a four-year-old daughter.
 
 Vinod’s wife Suman had died in 2011, following which he stayed for a brief period with his elder son in Delhi, before moving to Indore to stay with Amit.
 
 Bhavana apparently disliked Vinod staying with her family, following which she took the dire step, Malik said adding Amit claimed that he got suspicious of Bhavana’s intentions owing to her behavior towards his father.
 
 “We have asked Amit to submit detailed report by the private laboratory,” the inspector said.
 
 The police were in the process of recording statements of the family members and gathering details about the source of mercury.
