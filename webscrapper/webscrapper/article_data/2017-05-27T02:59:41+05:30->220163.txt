NEW DELHI: Facing flak from ministry of human resource development (MHRD),   has written to its colleges to advertise for the vacant permanent teachers’ positions by May 29. The university stated that in case the colleges fail to comply they “shall be solely accountable to face further consequences”. The letter was written to all colleges on May 22, 2017 by the joint registrar (colleges), DU.

 TOI reported on Yogesh Tyagi’s, vice chancellor, DU meeting with HRD minister   over the delay in appointments, where the minister expressed his concern.
 
 The university’s letter to the colleges stated that based on directions of the Delhi high court, a high powered committee has been constituted by the MHRD. The committee is monitoring the status of appointment of various teaching positions in the university and its colleges, and the colleges have been informed of the same several times.
 
 The letter further stated that “Keeping in view of the intervention of the high court, you are once again requested to kindly ensure that all the vacant teaching posts are published and advertised on the website of the College and in the national dailies latest by Monday, the May 29, 2017 positively.”
 
 While some colleges have started advertising the vacant positions, teachers are alleging that positions for physical education are not been advertised.
 
 Apprehending that this will again derail process, according to Ajay K Bhagi, member, executive council, “It is a matter of concern that the advertisement of teaching positions in colleges is without physical education subject, even in colleges where colleagues are teaching for years as assistant professor on adhoc basis. This is a clear deviation from the understanding that the university gave on May 10.”
