PATNA: JD (U) would contest the Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and   assembly elections, party’s national secretary general K C Tyagi told TOI on Tuesday. He said Bihar CM Nitish Kumar would address a public meeting at   in Chhattisgarh on May 30.

 Tyagi said like Gujarat, Nagaland and Karnataka, JD(U) would contest the upcoming elections in the three states alone. “We are not a part of NDA outside Bihar,” he clarified. On being asked about the number of seats JD(U) intends to contest, Tyagi said: “Numbers don’t matter. Our motive is to maintain our identity as a socialist party. Accordingly, we will field candidates in those pockets where people follow the Ram Manohar Lohia’s model of socialist movement.”
 
 Incidentally, JD(U) could not win a single seat either in Gujarat or in Karnataka, where it had fielded 15 and 34 candidates respectively. It, however, managed to win one seat in Nagaland where the party had fielded 15 candidates.
 
 Tyagi also said Nitish did not support The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill tabled in Parliament in August 2016 regarding citizenship to religious minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan in India. The bill has been referred to the Joint Parliamentary Committee upon protests from opposition parties.
 
 A delegation of All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) had met Nitish in Patna on May 16 about the possible adverse impacts of the bill in their state. Sources said Nitish had assured the AASU delegation that he would write to PM   to express his opposition against the bill.
