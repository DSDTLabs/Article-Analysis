 VMC had conducted an extensive razing drive along the   that connects Panigate to Gajrawadi. The gate of the temple had, however, remained a bottleneck. Temple authorities had obtained a stay against its razing when the road line was to be cleared in 1987.
 
 After discussion, it was decided to bring down the gate and other religious structures on the road. A meeting in this regard was held at VMC headquarters on Friday evening. The process to raze the wall began on Saturday morning.
 
 The Swaminarayan temple is located in the heart of a communally sensitive pocket of the city. Work on the temple was completed 140 years back and it is believed that the ‘dela’ or gate came up around the same time as the temple. Earlier, devotees had come together at the temple to oppose the move.
