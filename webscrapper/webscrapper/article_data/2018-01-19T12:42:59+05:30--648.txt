Madurai: Madurai city police handed over 90 vehicles including two autorickshaws to their owners at a function which took place in   on Thursday. It was the second phase of the city police’s endeavour in returning the unclaimed vehicles found in various parts of the city limits.

 Police higher officials including Madurai city police commissioner  , deputy commissioners V   (law and order) and Arun Balagopalan (traffic) and additional deputy commissioner   took part in the function to disburse the vehicles to their respective owners.
 
 Police said that, of the 90 vehicles, 88 were two-wheelers. Some of the owners got their vehicles back after 12 years. A special team formed by the commissioner traced the ownership details to restore the vehicles. On November 14 last year, as many as 88 vehicles were handed over to their respective owners in a similar exercise. They are being restored only after thoroughly verifying the documents produced by the owners.
 
 In a mammoth exercise last year, the city police had brought together a whopping 1,525 to the Armed Reserve ground. They were found on the station premises during the commissioner’s inspection. The vehicles were not only occupying the little space available on the campuses but also posing a health risk as the rainwater used to stagnate on them, providing a breeding place for mosquitoes.
 
 According to the city police, 180 vehicles were found to be from other districts. The respective police heads of the districts were communicated and its ownership details have been collected. Of the remaining 1122 more vehicles, the owner’s address have been traced for 309 vehicles. Soon, the owners would be communicated and the documents pertaining to the vehicles would be checked before giving back to them.
 
 Earlier on August 2017, as many as 501 vehicles were auctioned as no one claimed ownership to them. Rs 14.70 lakh collected through the auctioning was paid to the government.
