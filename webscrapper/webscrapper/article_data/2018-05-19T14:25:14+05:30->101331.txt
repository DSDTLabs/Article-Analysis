QUEPEM: A letter has been submitted to director of municipal administration seeking the disqualification of the chairperson of the  ,   Carneiro, for allegedly misusing her powers and indulging in illegal activities, including issuing an approval for a fish meal plant without a resolution by the council.

 Elvis Almeida, who was among those who protested the no-objection certificate (NOC) issued to the fish meal plant, wrote the letter to the director of municipal administration. 
 
 Carneiro had issued the NOC to the plant on April 24, without taking other councillors into confidence. She was subsequently grilled by opposition councillors and residents, prompting her to revoke the NOC within a matter of hours. 
 
 In his complaint, Almeida claimed that only a chief officer could issue an NOC based on a resolution taken by the council.
