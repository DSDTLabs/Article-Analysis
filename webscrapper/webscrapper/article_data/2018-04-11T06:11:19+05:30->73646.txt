AHMEDABAD: A 40-year-old man died after he was stabbed many times on Tuesday morning while asleep.   police have arrested the victim’s wife and her lover for the murder and also recovered the knife used by the assailant.

 Vejalpur police said that the body of Zafarulla Khan, 40, a resident of Millat-e-Ibrahim Apartment, Fatewadi, was found on the terrace of the apartment on the fourth floor at 2:30 am by his brother Imran Khan and other relatives. Zafarulla’s wife, Rehnuma Bano, informed Imran about the murder. Rehnuma had gone to her parents’ residence near   in Juhapura.
 
  
  “According to Imran’s complaint, Zafarulla was an auto-driver. He and his wife Rehnuma had shifted to their current address just a day earlier from their previous address in Jinnat Park, Juhapura. Here they used to live in a joint family. Rehnuma had been in love with Allarakha Shaikh (alias Shahrukh), a resident of Sankalitnagar for long. The duo used to meet frequently even at Zafarulla’s residence. When he opposed the relationship, Rehnuma had asked him to divorce her,” said a Vejalpur police officer.
 
  
  Zafarulla’s body was found with more than 10 stab wounds on his face, neck, stomach and on his back. He lay on his a bed on the terrace. Imran Khan got suspicious of the circumstances and had brought Rehnuma to the spot. When she was questioned by the police, she broke down and confessed that she had called Allarakha at about 1 am when Zafarulla was asleep.
 
 “Allarakha came with a knife and attacked Zafarulla . After the murder, Allarakha took Rehnuma on his scooter and dropped her at her parents’ home. She had Zafarulla’s phone with which she called Allarakha and later informed Imran about the murder. Allarakha was apprehended from his home within hours of the incident,” said a police officer.
