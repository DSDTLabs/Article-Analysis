KOCHI:  's decision to grant additional weightage in post-graduate medical admissions for MBBS doctors serving in government hospitals in rural areas has been challenged before the  .

 
 A total of 44 MBBS doctors have filed a petition through advocate P   challenging the amendment brought to PG Medical Education Regulations, 2000 on April 5th this year.
 
 While the additional weightage in marks was given to only for in-service candidates serving in remote or difficult areas, the amendment extended the benefit to those serving in rural areas too. All institutions outside the jurisdictional area of municipalities and corporations have been included in the classification of rural area, as per the amendment. For each year of service, in-service candidates are given additional weightage of 10 per cent of the marks obtained in National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), subject to a maximum of 30 per cent.
 
 It is alleged by the petitioners that the definition of rural area is too irrational when compared to the factual position prevailing in the state. Inclusion of 'rural areas' along with 'remote and/or difficult areas' is illegal, irrational, and procedurally improper, the petition filed by Dr   P of Padiyoor near Irinjalakkuda and 43 others said.
 
 They have also contended that the change was implemented by MCI halfway through the selection process and is detrimental to the legitimate expectation of getting selected in the second allotment or the spot admission.
 
 The petitioners are seeking a court declaration that the amendment is illegal as it was announced halfway through the selection process and as the definition of 'rural area' is irrational and illegal.
