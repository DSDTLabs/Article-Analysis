CHENNAI:   heading out of   will soon be able to   without having to depend on buses or autos.

 Metrorail will rent out bicycles for commuters in the underground stations in an attempt to reduce traffic congestion and pollution on road. But passengers may have to wait a bit longer for feeder services to be in place to get last mile connectivity.
 
  (CMRL) has floated tenders for procuring bicycles for the seven underground stations, which were opened for public on Sunday .
 
 According to the tender invite, eight bicycles for men and two for women will be procured. The contractors will have to deliver them to Cmrl within two weeks from the date of reception of purchase order. Commuters who want to rent out a bicycle may have to pay a refundable deposit. According to officials, the idea of renting out bicycles is to improve patronage, as commuters can easily access neighbourhoods without having to depend on other public transport or spend on autos or cabs.
 
 Earlier this year, CMRL launched a pilot plan where commuters could rent out bicycles by making a refundable deposit of Rs 3,000.
 
 “The cycles can be rented for free. They can either take the bicycle and return it the same day or use it for more than a day or two. When they return the bicycle, their deposit would be returned. This service will be quite useful for regular commuters,“ an official said.
 
 In January 2017, CMRL started off on a small scale by stationing 10   for commuters. They had also floated tenders to procure more bicycles.
 
 CMRL is not the only mass transit facility to take the green route. Metros in Delhi and Bengaluru had launched this rental scheme. But the plan did not receive good response in Bengaluru and BMRC introduced bikes in a few stations in mid-2016 where commuters can rent them by the hour.
