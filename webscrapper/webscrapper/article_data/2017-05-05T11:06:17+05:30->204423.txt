THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   on Thursday sought response from Kerala on a plea by Tamil Nadu alleging that the neighbouring state is not allowing it to maintain the Mullaperiyar dam.

 A bench comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D   and Justice S K   issued notice to Kerala and fixed the plea of Tamil Nadu for hearing in the second week of July.
 
 Tamil Nadu, in its plea, has sought execution of the apex court judgment in the case, saying it has been held that Tamil Nadu will have a right to maintain the dam while its security would be taken care of by Kerala. Tamil Nadu has alleged that its officials are not allowed to perform the maintenance work of the dam.
 
 Earlier, the apex court had rapped Tamil Nadu government for seeking deployment of   for ensuring safety and security of the Mullaperiyar dam, saying there cannot be a “perennial `amrit dhara' kind of litigation“, forcing the state to withdraw it. In its May 7, 2014 verdict, the Supreme Court had held that the 120-year-old Mullaperiyar dam was safe and allowed the Tamil Nadu government to raise the water level to 142 feet and ultimately to 152 feet after completion of strengthening measures on the dam. Kerala had later moved the apex court for clarification on its verdict and contended that the water storage should not be increased to 142 feet until all the 13 spillover gates of the dam were operational.
 
 The apex court had earlier too dismissed Kerala's plea to review its 2014 verdict, saying there was no reason to interfere with the judgment of the Constitution bench.
 
 Mullaperiyar dam is a masonry dam and was constructed pursuant to the   Lease Agreement of October 29, 1886 across the  . The construction continued for about eight years and was completed in 1895. The dam, situated in Idukki district, is owned and operated by the Tamil Nadu government.
