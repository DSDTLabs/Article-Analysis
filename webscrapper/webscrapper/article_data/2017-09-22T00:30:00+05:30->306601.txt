Mysuru: The water adventure   facility, proposed by the state government at Varuna Lake, will be developed on the lines of the one in Kutch (Gujarat), said youth empowerment and sports minister Pramod Madhwaraj.

 Speaking after inaugurating the   festival at the lake, which is being organized as part of Dasara, the minister said: “In the last budget, the government has sanctioned Rs 5 crore for water adventure sports at the lake. Developing it on PPP model will enable us to provide more facilities like food court, accommodation and training. The process for the same has already started. The facility will be on a par with the Kutch facility.”
 
 After inaugurating the sporting event, the minister went around in a speed boat and also enjoyed a ride in jet ski. “Before coming here, I was sleepy. But this adrenalin rush blew the sleep away,” he said. 
 
 Rajaneesh Goel, additional chief secretary and Anupam Agarwal, director of DYES, also enjoyed the speed-boat ride.
 
 H J Raghavendra, who visited the facility along with his wife Sreeroopa and two children, said: “It’s a good initiative by the government. Such rides give us a thrilling experience.”
 
 The visitors will get to enjoy jet ski, banana ride, speed-boat ride, kayaking, canoeing and still-water rafting. There are different fare for the six rides, but one can enjoy all of them by paying Rs 800 under the Gethna package. The 10-day water sports, being jointly organized by DYES and General Thimmaiah of National Academy, will conclude on September 30.
