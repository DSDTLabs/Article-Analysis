 Mohit Malik is quite a stickler for perfection. So, it came as no surprise when he enrolled himself in a music class to perfect the part of a rock star in his upcoming show, 'Kullfi Kumarr Bajewala'. Since it’s a musical, the actor is leaving no stone unturned to make his portrayal as authentic as possible. To add to it, Mohit has always been inclined towards art forms, like dance and singing. He has also lost oodles of weight and toned his body to look the part.

His will be the principal character, and his track will result in the culmination of the finite show. Aamir says, “For the first time in my 19-year-long career, I have been asked to keep my grey hair. I am a little sceptical about it, but the look is different from my previous outings. It’s kind of rugged and lends an edgy feel to the character.”
 
 
 
 
 TV show 'Woh Apna Sa', which features   and Disha Parmar, will see a new entry in Kinshuk Vaidya. The actor will play Aakash, a doctor, whose entry will lead to a twist in the tale. Interestingly, Kinshuk started shooting for 'Woh Apna Sa' on March 5, the same date last year when his fiction show 'Ek Rishta Saajhedari Ka' ended. He says, “Basically, it was an year-long vacation for me. Or maybe, I should say that I got that much time to prepare myself for a new show.”
