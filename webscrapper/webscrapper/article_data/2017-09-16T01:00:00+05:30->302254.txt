Music transcends all boundaries and brings people closer and composer   Gupta, has managed, in a coup of sorts, to turn this dictum into reality. He recently composed the river anthem   as an offering for the rally for rivers, (a cause to save India’s rivers).
 
 Some of the biggest names from various fields that got together to be a part of the anthem, include  ,  ,  , Nawazuddin Siddiqui,  ,  , Sachin Gupta, Avanie Joshi, Maniesh Paul,  , Darshan Rawal and others.
 
 It is the first time ever that Sadhguru has lent his voice to a song.Sachin, known for his songs in Prince, YPD2, Mere Dad Ki Maruti and Finding Fanny, is excited about the anthem. 
 
 Talking about the project he says, “60 per cent of India’s rivers have dried up and the situation is just getting worse. This anthem is for a great cause and supports that feeling and the pledge to save and preserve our rivers from now on. It was a once-in-a lifetime opportunity and felt like a direct blessing from the Sadhguru.”
