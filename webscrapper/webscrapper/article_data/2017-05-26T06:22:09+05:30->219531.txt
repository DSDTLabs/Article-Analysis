MOHALI: Appalled by the extremely poor Class X board examination results, Punjab chief minister Captain   on Thursday ordered the Punjab   Board (PSEB) chairman to resign, paving the way for a major shake-up of the education department. 

 This came two days after the CM sought a report from the education minister on the poor results. The CM directed education minister Aruna Choudhary to seek the resignation of board chairman Balbir Singh Dhol.
 
 The interim charge of the board has been handed over to additional chief secretary (school education) and a search committee has ordered to be set up to find a new chairperson in the next 30 days, a spokesperson said. The committee will consist of chief secretary, Punjab, as chairman, and ACS (School Education) & vice-chancellor (Panjab University, Chandigarh) as members.
 
 Dhol said, “I have resigned on moral grounds.“ He was appointed as board chairman in December 2016, but his appointment was challenged. He served as DPI Schools before this.
 
 The spokesperson further said that the CM has sent out a strong message that nobody will be allowed to play with the future of the children of Punjab. Expressing serious concern over the poor Class X results, the spokesperson said the Amarinder has made it clear that he would not tolerate any further laxity in the matter of improving the school education system.
 
 The CM has ordered all con cerned officials and departments to ready a detailed roadmap for bringing the education system in the state on track. He has also directed the education minister to prepare a blueprint for raising the standards of education in the state.
 
 Appointment challenged in Jan
 
 Advocate Hari Chand Arora had challenged the appointment of Balbir Singh Dhol as chairman of the PSEB in Punjab and   in January 2017. Arora said the appointment was made after bending the norms laid by PSEB for appointing a chairman.
