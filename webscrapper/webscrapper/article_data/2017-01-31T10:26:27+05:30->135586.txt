BHUBANESWAR: Pradeep Sethy, chief of Artha Tatwa (AT) Group  , foiled an   of a   from the premises of city court here on Monday. 

 Court sources said as the criminal Shahjahan Khan, alias Patu, was trying to escape, Sethy noticed it and alerted the police personnel. Interestingly, Khan was trying to scale the court wall when Sethy was engaged in a heated argument with some police officers over an issue. 
 
 Sethy was brought from Jharpada jail and produced before the CBI court. As Sethy and Khan were waiting for arrival of court van to return to the jail, Sethy picked an argument with the police officers when they warned him against speaking to the media on the court premises. Sethy was telling the media about involvement of two BJD ministers in the chit fund scam. 
 
 As the police officers were trying to placate Sethy, several lawyers gathered around him. The cops were struggling to control the crowd. This gave Khan an opportunity to try to escape. As he was stealthily trying to flee, Sethy alerted the police, said a lawyer. 
 
 Khan had escaped from police custody in the past too. Khan, who was arrested here on March 2 last year, had escaped from SCB Medical College and Hospital during treatment the very next day. Police arrested him again on November 10, 2016.
