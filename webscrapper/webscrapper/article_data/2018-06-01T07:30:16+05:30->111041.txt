LUDHIANA: A youth stabbed his drunkard brother-in-law to death for beating up his sister in Jalandhar Bypass early on Thursday. 

 The deceased has been identified as scrap dealer  , 32, and the accused as Guddu, 19.
 
 Police said Bhim Thakur, a resident of Dana Mandi, would often thrash his wife, Meera, in an inebriated condition. 
 
 “Bhim’s wife and four children, aged between two and 10, were home when he came drunk on Wednesday night. After an argument, Bhim started beating up his wife. Their eldest daughter ran to the house of her grandfather, who lives nearby, and apprised him of the incident. Her grandfather, along with his son Guddu, rushed to Meera’s rescue. When Guddu saw Bhim strangulating Meera, he took him outside the house and stabbed him twice, in chest and stomach, with a knife,” Salem Tabri police station SHO inspector Vijay Kumar said. 
 
 As Bhim, a native of Uttar Pradesh, died on the spot, neighbours called up the police. Police have arrested the accused and recovered the weapon used in the crime. 
 
 A case under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC has been registered.
