AURANGABAD:  are gearing up to launch  , a specially designed application that will ensure transparency while assigning daily duties to policemen and take attendance.

 The move is an attempt to do away with the frequent complaints of the hazeri major showing favouritism while assigning duties. The app is likely to be launched within the fortnight. It will be android based and can work cross platform on computers as well.
 
 Once the app is launched, all senior police officers including the assistant commissioner of police, deputy commissioner of police and commissioner of police will directly be able to monitor each policeman in the city. 
 
 The hazeri major coordinates and assigns all duties right from the police station to the crime branch, traffic department and special cell. All police units across the state are fraught with the common problem of alleged partiality by the hazeri major. 
 
  of police Yashasvi Yadav told TOI that there are a lot of complaints of favouritism and corruption against hazeri majors. “Sometimes, we find evidence supporting these allegations and initiate action,” he said.
 
 The officer said that each time punishment is not feasible every time and so it was decided to introduce utmost transparency in daily affairs.
 
 He said it will keep track of each and every duty assigned to individuals in a unit. This will evenly distribute daily tasks and those who have abstained from getting any challenging task will be assigned one at regular intervals.
 
 A senior police officer said that including an assistant and deputy commissioner of police have to deal with the complaints against the hazeri majors. “Hazeri majors often go scot free as they work in connivance with their respective police station or branch chiefs,” said an assistant commissioner of police.
 
 CP Yadav said, “Following the application’s launch, human interference in the process would be minimum and check incidents of favouritism and corruption.”
