Actor   has been one person, who has amazed Malayali audience with his effortless performance and sheer determination. That said, while the actor essayed the role of the stammering Sudhi in Su Su Sudhi Vathmeekam, legendary footballer VP Sathyan, his latest role as the transwoman Marykutty in   had literally swept fans off the floor. 

  The song from Njan Marykutty titled Doore Doore, which was out recently, gave glimpses of the journey of the protagonist. While all eyes were on Jayasurya’s awe-inspiring transformation, junior Jayasurya, Advaith’s presence as Marykutty’s younger self captured much attention. 
 
  The little kid has portrayed the dilemma of Marykutty as a child, and how the character could resist from wearing lipstick, sari, bindi and bangles. 
 However, this is not the first time when Jayasurya and team felt that Advaith could essay his father’s childhood in his film like none other. And look how he has aced it! Like father, like son…
 
  The earlier Jayasurya-starrers, in which Advaith was seen are Su Su Sudhi Vathmeekam and Captain.
