AHMEDABAD: Vanita (name changed), a class X student from Ahmedabad, called   — 18002333330 — and told the counsellor that she was under tremendous stress. When questioned, she said that she was not good at mathematics but her parents wanted her to choose the science stream for better career prospects.

 “We told her to hand over the phone to her parents,” the counsellor told TOI. “Later, we had a word with her father and told him that undue stress on the student might prove counterproductive and asked him to find out what she is good at and to let her bloom.” It was not a one-off case for the helpline — run by the Suraskha Setu Society of Gandhinagar Police and Mumbai-based   — as counsellors attend to over 150 calls every day from across the state related to board  .
 
 Pravin Valera, the inspector with the Gandhinagar Police and the coordinator for the helpline, said that the volume increased after the helpline number was given in the receipt for the board exams. “The common complaints we get are about students not remembering what they have read or not being able to concentrate on studies,” he said. 
 
 
  
 
 “Students also talk about stress related to specific subjects such as mathematics and English.” Valera said that this year the thrust is on parent counselling as well. The helpline had prevented two class XII students from committing suicide last year.
 
 Ruwab Khemchandani, a senior counsellor at Jeevan Aastha, said that in about 20% of the cases, counsellors talk to parents when students complain of stress caused by parental aspirations or by overly stringent study regimen imposed by parents. 
 
 “Every student is different and something that works for one might not work for the other,” she said. “We try to assess the real issue from the callers’ complaints and concentrate on how pre-exam anxiety can be addressed in the best way.”
