COIMBATORE:  , who threatened to leave the Sasikala's faction of the AIADMK over the death of two men in a stone quarry, backtracked on Monday after the district administration cancelled the licence of the quarry. 

 Kanagaraj said he had issued such a statement in frustration as he couldn't do anything to stop the irregularities in the quarry, despite being an MLA. "Now that the licence has been cancelled, I withdraw my earlier statement,'' he said.
 
 The stone quarry functioning in 1.6 hectares of land at   near   was licenced to mine stone and gravel. 
 
 The licencee E Anandkumar had allegedly quarried beyond the permissible limits, resulting in a deep pit where water had stagnated. Two workers drowned in the pit on Friday. Sulur MLA  , who inspected the quarry, was upset that none of the officials inspected the quarry though they had been informed about the alleged irregularities.
 
 Soon after the visit, Kanagaraj, a first time MLA, threatened that he would quit the AIADMK and join those who serve people," which was seen as an indirect threat to join the   camp. 
 
 However, in a swift move, the collector cancelled the licence issued to Anand Kumar to quarry stone. "Due to the death of two workers in the quarry, the licence issued to E Anandkumar is being cancelled," said collector T N Hariharan in a statement.
 
 The move came after Kanagaraj's statement created a flutter forcing senior AIADMK leaders to pacify him. "I visited the quarry and informed the officials. Even after that they did not take any action against the quarry owners. I was frustrated that despite being an MLA I couldn't do anything. I didn't know what to do. Also I wanted to attract the attention of the chief minister. Hence I issued such a statement," Kanagaraj said.
