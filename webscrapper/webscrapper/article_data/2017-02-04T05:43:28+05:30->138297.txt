BHOPAL: It was   after breakfast. “I killed her because I suspected her of cheating on me,” said 32-year-old   Das when TOI asked him about live-in partner Akansha’s murder on Friday. After a pause, he added: “I was confused.”

 It was 4am. Akansha’s body had been dug out of the concrete tomb that Udyan had built by hand. The airtight tomb had mummified her remains over the last seven months — police say Akansha was murdered in July, within 20 days of moving in with Udyan, and not on December 27 as he had claimed. Udyan showed no emotion as the girl, who gave herself up for his lies, was carried away in a body bag. The entire room was stinking, littered with soiled utensils, bottles of liquor, thousands of cigarette butts and soiled clothes. A noose that he had tied for himself weeks ago dangled ominously overhead.
 
 Clad in a blue shirt, he looked tired and answered questions in a low voice. “I know Akansha since she was 16 years old and studying at Vanasthali Vidyapeeth near Jaipur. I met her on Orkut after which we came to know each other. I was studying in Delhi at that time,” he said.
 
 When asked what drove him to murder, he said: “I was confused. I thought she was having an affair. She used to receive calls, which made me think she was going around with someone.”
 
 Recalling the day of the murder, he said: “One day (he didn’t say the exact date), we both woke up at 10 in the morning. I made breakfast after which we had an argument as I was suspicious about her. I killed her by choking her with a pillow and then strangling her neck by hand.”
 
 Judge Gaurav Pragyanan granted   police transit remand of 15 days so that the accused can be presented in a Bankura court. Udyan stood silently. Bengal police said in court that they had informed Udyan’s family about his arrest, which he readily corroborated.
