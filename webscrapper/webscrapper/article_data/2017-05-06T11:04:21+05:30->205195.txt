CHANDIGARH: The Union ministry of   development (MHRD) is going to review a proposal for granting central university status to  ,   joint organising   claimed on Friday. 

 Shriniwas claimed that the issue was discussed in a recent meeting between Union MHRD minister   and a delegation of ABVP from PU. ABVP has been demanding central status for PU after it announced a fee hike from the next session for freshers. The central status, it is believed, will resolve the financial crunch the university has been facing for the past few years due to an increase in the deficit in annual budget.
 
 PU has already constituted a special committee for reviewing the pros and cons of it getting a central university status.
 
 A detailed note about the first meeting of PU's panel which has been formed for delibrating on the pros and cons of central status to the varsity, will be tabled in the special senate on Sunday.
 
 The issue of central status to PU has been hanging fire since 2008. On August 26, 2008, the Punjab government had given its consent to the Union human resource development ministry for giving central university status on three conditions. 
 
 The government stated in NOC that the name of the university will not be changed, PU's affiliation to colleges in the state will continue and representation in the senate, which is the governing body, will also continue in PU. 
 
 But, after a week, the state government withdrew the consent and asked the MHRD not to consider PU for central status, following political pressure.
