NAGPUR: The anti-encroachment squad of   ( ) and traffic police finally cleared encroachments by fruit juice kiosks in front of the civic body’s headquarters in Civil Lines. 

 The squad also removed encroachments by roadside vendors from the public help booth at   city bus stop stand.
 
 Recently, TOI reported the encroachments and the news drew the attention of NMC officials and Nagpur city traffic police.
 
 Vendors had encroached upon a public help booth at Maharajbagh, which was meant to guide daily bus commuters through the chaos of the busy bus stand. The encroachments had been there for the past few years, yet no action was taken against them by the NMC or police. TOI had received complaints from passengers about the inconvenience in this matter. 
 
 After the TOI report, the enforcement and market department picked up the issue. 
 
 TOI spoke to passengers who expressed their happiness over the action taken.   said, “The removing of encroachment is good, but it is useful only if the officials actually use the structure for its intended purpose. 
 
 “I request the NMC to make a site specifically for the city bus services with all the information like bus routes, timing etc for our benefit.” 
 
 Another commuter, Sudhir Naidu, said, “A further step would be making a helpline for the passengers to help them and serve better.”
 
 Similarly, the traffic police took cognisance of TOI’s report on mobile fruit juice centres in front of NMC’s headquarters. The police penalized five owners of the kiosks. 
 
 Led by DCP (traffic) Smartana Patil, the traffic police also issued warnings to two eating joints, East India Company and Nanking, on Rabindranath Tagore Marg in Civil Lines for encroaching a major portion of the roads by putting up barricades.
