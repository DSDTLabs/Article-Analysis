KOCHI:   Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday made a short visit to the third edition of Kochi Muziris Biennale. Speaking after inaugurating a seminar on ‘Importance of Sustainable Cultural Building’, he said, “Kerala has always been known for its secular approach towards art and culture. The   is a proud symbol of this approach and the sense of oneness and inclusivity that exists here.”

 He said that events like Biennale add to the state’s rich history and culture and praised the government for its initiatives and contribution to the event. “We need the arts. All over the world cultural activities are easy targets for spending cuts. But if the state is to act as a catalyst then what must be its role? What institutions must be built, and what confidence measures should be taken? The   is a good case study of what is possible when different agencies come together to pursue profound goals,” he added. 
 
  The President later visited Biennale’s main venue, Aspinwall House.
