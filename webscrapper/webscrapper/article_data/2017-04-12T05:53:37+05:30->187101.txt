CHENNAI: Nuclear   of India (NPCIL) on Tuesday said it is confident of   1 of   Project on its own, after   of Companies, a subsidiary Russia’s ROSATOM, having fulfilled its  , relinquished operational responsibility of the plant.

 The first test for NPCIL in running the first phase of the plant and related equipment will be on April 12, when it shuts down Unit 1 without external assistance and commences refuelling the reactor.
 
 “We will shut Unit 1 down for two months to refuel the plant,” Kudankulam site director Hari Narayan Sahu said, adding that their experience in removing old fuel and refuelling the reactor will allow them to conduct both operations without assistance from the Russian firm, which built the plant.
 
 The country’s single largest nuclear reactor, with a capacity of 1000MW, has drawn attention after charges that design faults that prompted changes and other problems, including in insertion of valves, affected the commissioning of the plant and generation of power.
 
 NPCIL is now, part by part, assessing the maintenance of Unit 1. The nuclear power company is confident of maintaining the electrical parts of the reactor and other equipment but could enter an agreement with ASE for maintenance of other major equipment, NPCIL sources said.
 
 “The warranty period showed reliable and safe operation of Unit 1,” a statement by ACE last Thursday said. Operation of Unit 1 will be “the responsibility of the Indian side” from April 12, it said.
 
 Unit 2 will restart operations on the same day that NPCIL shuts down Unit 1. “Power generation will restart from April 12 or 13,” Sahu said.
 
 Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) will have to manage without power from Unit 1 this summer.
 
 A senior Tangedco official said the situation was not new. “Unit 1 has mostly not generated power during the summer months,” he said. “Our dependence on [power from the nuclear facility] has reduced.”
