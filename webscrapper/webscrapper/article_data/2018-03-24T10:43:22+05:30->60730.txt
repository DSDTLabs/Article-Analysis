ZIRAKPUR: With garbage collection staff failing to turn up in Zirakpur for the past five days, dustbins are overflowing and there’s a trail of trash everywhere. The municipal council claims the company responsible for garbage collection has some issue with the environment department and is therefore, not doing its duty.

 Authorities said there is no dedicated area for dumping of garbage in Zirakpur at present. The government acquired 10 acres of land at Samgoli, Dera Bassi where a solid waste management plant will be set up. But as 40 acres of land is under court litigation, the project has not taken off till date. Land has been allocated to the company for garbage disposal and making compost, which is yet to start.
 
 Now that garbage is not being collected, the entire area has started stinking.  , a resident of Savitry said it has become routine for sweepers to burn garbage at night, due to which people, particularly children and the elderly, face acute breathing problems.
 
 Manoj Das, a resident of   said authorities have informed them that the dumping yard near the Zirakpur police station has been forcibly closed by residents living nearby due to the foul smell. He said a few people burnt garbage dumped in an MC dustbin near   and the entire area enveloped in thick smoke. He said he posted pictures to the Mohali deputy commissioner but nothing was done.
 
 Residents alleged that the authorities, including MC officials, DC office or councillors are serious about solving the problem. Complaining about the ignorance of authorities, residents said the garbage situation has rendered Zirakpur vulnerable to disease, choking drains and environmental hazard.
 
 Pradip Sharma, a member of Chandigarh Enclave Residents’ Welfare Association also said the problem has assumed mammoth proportions.
