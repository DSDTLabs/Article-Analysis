 has earned himself a strong place in the   industry. While his movies might at times fail to garner accolades, Sidharth has always remained one of the hottest and talented actors of the new-age.

 Recently,   was present at an event in Goa where he was asked a question on how does he go beyond his "good looks" as an actor. To this Sidharth very politely replied that people love to see good faces on screen. He added that he doesn’t consider himself as more than an average-looking guy. The ‘Ittefaq’   also said that he doesn’t believe that there is anything exceptional in the way he looks.
 
 Considering his non-Bollywood background, Sidharth has come a long way. Whatever he has achieved so far, he has done everything on his own with his talent and self –belief. When he was asked about the celebrity-status that he gets to witness for himself, Sid humbly replied and explained how he has lived a regular lifestyle for 25 years. He added that it takes a lot of hard work to get to this place and so they should also enjoy this much-deserved fame. 
 
 There was also a fun rapid fire round, where Sidharth gave a tongue-in-cheek reply when quipped about his "relationship status". When he was asked whether he is single or committed, he cheekily said that his answer to that would totally depend on who is asking it.
