NEW DELHI: Repeated threats in the past few months to other Test playing nations of not honouring the   ( ) or threatening to withdraw from  's events completely backfired on   ­ which was keen to protect the Big Three financial model ­ at the recently-held meeting in Dubai, sources told TOI.

 BCCI's belligerent stand on the financial model irked the   Full Members so much that they refused to postpone the voting process despite repeated requested by BCCI's representative for board meeting,  .
 
 Sources said Limaye did not take a confrontationist line to force the other Test playing nations into fall in line. His official line was to seek time to suggest changes in the ICC paper, if needed.
 
 However, sources said that at the Asian Cricket Council's meeting on February 3 in Dubai, the other BCCI representatives expressed displeasure at the change in financial model to countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The BCCI officials, however, denied threatening any Test playing nation and said they simply explained that India could lose close to Rs 1800 crore in the next eight years.
 
 “It was a normal conversation, where the members were told that it was BCCI's agreement with those countries to support India on Big Three formulae. The Big Three agreement was made in 2014 after consulting the Test playing nations. If they are backtracking now or coming under any external influence, it's certainly not good news for India,“ a BCCI source explained.
 
 Ironically , the committee of administrators (COA) is not on the same page as the BCCI officials.
