VADODARA/ANAND: A total of 173 students of post graduate programme in rural management (PRM) have graduated this year from the Institute of Rural Management, Anand ( ) which organised its 36th annual convocation ceremony on Saturday. 

 Ritika Goel, who had topped her batch of PRM 36, was awarded the prestigious Kuchibhotla Vasanthi   medal during the convocation ceremony, which was presided over by IRMA’s chairman   while Dr  , senior fellow of the  , Colombo, Sri Lanka, was the chief guest. 
 
 Shah recollected the days when he had worked closely with IRMA’s founder and father of India’s White Revolution late Dr  . 
 
 “The best thing he left behind was his idea of IRMA. IRMA should use every convocation to revive and reflect over the work of that exceptional man. Hidden in his legacy is the idea of IRMA that is even more relevant today than it was then,” he said. To the graduating batch he shared six thoughts for mulling over. These included creating a vibrant and nurturing eco-system around them, never to let perfection be the enemy of excellence, and excellence the enemy of good, respect and cherish productivity, manage by demanding performance from co-workers but also matching it by hand-holding and support. This, he shared, was Dr Kurien’s formula.
