LUDHIANA: Two days after TOI reported that Anil Bhalla, managing director of   (OGTL), will move court against status quo ordered by the Delhi high court on assets, shares and bank accounts of late   (chairman of  ) on case filed by Oswal's estranged son Pankaj against his mother Aruna Oswal, brother Shael and sister Shalu Jindal, Bhalla has fired another salvo at Pankaj by releasing a press statement accusing him of misleading the court.He has also decided to take appropriate legal proceedings against Pankaj.

 In the release sent to the media, Bhalla has lashed out at Pankaj on his claims of being legal heir to his father's property on account of `rasam pagri' ceremony in which the pagri (turban) was tied on Pankaj's head.Soon after Delhi high court had ordered a status quo in the case, Pankaj had issued a release through his legal representative giving details about Oswal's assets.
 
 “From the news released we have got to know that Pankaj Oswal has misled the honourable high court court by including the company's assets in Abhey Oswal's estate.For instance, 3 Tilak Marg is an asset of Oswal Greentech Limited and the court has been mislead to believe it is an asset of Mr Oswal. Post review of the documents filed by Pankaj Oswal, the company will take appropriate legal proceedings,“ the statement read.
 
 Bhalla has further stated, “Oswal Agro Mills (OAM) and OGTL are public companies that are professionally run and operated through board of directors and their operations are not and cannot be subject to any succession battle. Abhey Kumar Oswal, at the time of his death, was chairperson of both companies, a whole-time director of OGTL and a director of OAM. If, director of a public company dies or is incapacitated, a new one is appointed by the current board of directors based on merits of the individual. In this case, the current board of directors by majority appointed Aruna Oswal as chairperson and additional director of both companies on April 2, 2016, on the basis of her capabilities and merits.“
 
 Bhalla has not disclosed when OGTL will challenge the status quo order and whether or not the company will file any new case against Pankaj.
 
 Sachin Deshmukh, legal counsel of Pankaj Oswal, refused to comment on the latest development.
