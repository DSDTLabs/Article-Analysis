TUTICORIN: The traditional food festival organised by the Tuticorin district administration was a crowd-puller at the  . Though the crowd was much less than expected on Friday, the first day of the festival, response was overwhelming on the weekend. Around 50 food stalls were put up at the food festival. 
 
 Among the stalls that drew heavy crowds was one from   that served chicken idiyappam biryani, beef idiyappam biryani and mutton idiyappam biryani and   (chicken) kanji (gruel). Owner of the stall A   said that this is the first time, their more than three-decades-old shop has put-up a stall.
 
 “We sold 150 idiyappam biryani plates in an hour. More than 600 cups of kari kanji (at Rs 20 a cup) was sold in less than two hours. Another item that got sold out completely in just an hour was 500 plates of   sapadu a prominent Muslim wedding food. In this delicacy we serve ghee rice with beef gravy made with crushed badam, pista and figs,” he said.
 
 Traditional snacks such as dum adai kayal halwa and nanakatha biscuit (made of butter and oats) also sold like hot cakes. Games and cultural programmes were organised for the public on all three days. A dog show was organised as part of the events on Saturday.
 
 However there was disappointment as there were not many stalls that had traditional food items. Only one or two stalls had sea food, despite fish being a staple food in the coastal district that has a sizable fishermen population. Leading hotel chains had their stalls in the exhibition and offered popular items such as biriyani and other commonly available food items such as fried rice and noodles.
