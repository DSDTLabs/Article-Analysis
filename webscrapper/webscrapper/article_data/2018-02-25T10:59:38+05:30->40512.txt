OLD GOA: Thousands of devotees from across the state flocked to the   on Friday for the annual feast of the miraculous cross. February 23 also marked the 399th anniversary of an apparition of Jesus on a wooden cross planted at the site. 

 The solemn feast mass was celebrated by fifteen priests in a specially-erected pandal outside the shrine. The main celebrant was Fr  , parish priest of Se Cathedral. There were two earlier masses at 6.30am and 8am, and rice gruel (pez) was served to devotees after every mass. The Fr Mario Dâ€™Costa-led Se Cathedral choir led the singing at all three masses, and rice gruel (pez) was distributed to devotees thereafter. 
 
 The belief in the miraculous cross dates back to the early 17th century. It is believed that some shepherd boys from the locality erected a three-and-a-half-foot tall cross where the shrine stands today. At midnight on February 23, 1619, it grew to six feet, and rays of bright light were seen emanating from the sky and falling on the cross, on which was the crucified Christ. 
 
 Thus began the devotion to the miraculous cross.
