 Participating in the inaugural session of the two-day national seminar on ‘Cashless economy’, organized by the Centre for Mass Communication and Media Studies (CMS) of   (CUSB) here, the academics observed that if properly implemented, cashless economy would bring a revolutionary change in the society and reduce the gap between haves and have-nots.
 
 CUSB vice-chancellor  , in his presidential remarks, drew the similarities between teachers and media personnel as far as mass education is concerned. He asked the members of both these professions to work with utmost dedication to ensure proper implementation of   “Cashless economy is a welcome move and media can play a vital role in making it successful,” Rathore said. 
 
 In his key note address, Prof   said although cashless economy is a landmark step of the central government, there are certain hiccups that need to be addressed properly. “The loopholes of the banking system exposed after the demonetisation drive must be plugged in. Unavailability of internet connectivity in remote areas is causing great hindrances in implementation of cashless economy. The concept of digital economy should be propagated in a right direction with the help of media,” Singh added. 
 
 Earlier, CMS head Atish Prashar welcomed the guests and participants.
