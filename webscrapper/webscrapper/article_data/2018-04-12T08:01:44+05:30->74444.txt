AHMEDABAD: The   high court on Wednesday issued a notice to the divisional railway manager in response to a PIL filed by an association of autorickshaw drivers opposing the new parking system that is to be implemented at the Kalupur railway station.

 The proposed parking system will make a autorickshaw driver pay Rs 20 as parking fee for waiting beyond 15 minutes inside the station area. The president of the association, Abdul Jabbar Ganchi, has filed the PIL before the HC and urged it to direct the railways not to implement the time-based scheme of parking, and to not restrict vehicles from entering the railway station area.
 
 The autorickshaw drivers have said that the new parking system is not just bad for them, but also for passengers. The association members had also staged a protest against the parking system at the station on Monday. 
 
 They argued that the new system would lead to more congestion and hit auto drivers badly. It will make ferrying passengers to the railway station unaffordable.
 
 The HC will hear this matter further on July 4.
