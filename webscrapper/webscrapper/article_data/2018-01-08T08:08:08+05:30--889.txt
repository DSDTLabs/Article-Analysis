HYDERABAD: Road no. 36 in   is one of the highstreet locations in the country where the luxury residential and retail sectors have synced up—shows the latest report published by a   consultant.

 According to the report, Road No. 36, situated in Jubilee Hills’ upmarket residential area, is a prime and upscale shopping street that was traditionally known as a posh residential area. The stretch has transformed into a prime destination for high-street fashion in Hyderabad—reads the   report published by JLL.
 
 Other such locations identified across the country, include   in Bengaluru, Hiranandani Estate in Powai, Mumbai, Mehar Chand Market in New Delhi and Galleria market in Gurgaon.
 
 “In any given location, a certain type of retail follows a corresponding type of housing. An area which primarily houses middle-class families will attract a lot of unorganized or mom n' pop retail outlets, hypermarkets which enable value shopping for daily needs, and malls with a lot of mainstream brands. Likewise, luxury housing destinations are most logically juxtaposed with highend retail,” said Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock Poperty Consultants.
 
 Local developers attributed the growth of the retail market in Jubilee Hills to its proximity to an ‘affluent population’ and the city’s IT hub.“Jubilee Hills has traditionally been known as an upscale residential area and for this reason, has attracted a huge affluent population over the years. Today, its proximity to Hi-Tec City and the footfall it garners from the region is also driving the growth of the retail market,” said MV Rajeshwar Rao, CEO of Confederation Of Real Estate Developers Association of India.
