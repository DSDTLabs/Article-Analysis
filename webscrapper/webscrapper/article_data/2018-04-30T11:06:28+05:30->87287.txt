JAIPUR: Last December, the government informed Rajya Sabha that over 500 lakh toilets had been constructed under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan across the country. At Kamalkheda village in Ganeshpura gram panchayat of Shahabad block in Baran district, however, villagers say the toilets constructed by the government cannot be used. Villager Munni Bai said, “We get water from a private tubewell one km away from where we stay. Water is precious, we fetch it for our families and for the cattle. We can barely afford to have it drained down toilets.” Despite having toilets, the villagers prefer to answer nature’s call out in the open.

 The women walk in the scorching heat of summer to fetch water from a km away. There are tubewells in the village, but none of them work anymore. Firoz Khan, a social activist who travels in these areas frequently, told TOI, “Villagers have petitioned authorities in this matter. Fetching water is an arduous task, and keeps many children and women engaged for several hours each day.” 
 
 Ganeshpura sarpanch Ram Kishen Mehta said, “At present, water is being supplied through a motor installed in the fields. The problem occurs only when the motor malfunctions.”
 
 District collector SP Singh said, “It is not true that water is not available anywhere. We assess the needs and send water. It is likely that there is heavy demand in some areas but this report of water being unavailable is untrue.”
