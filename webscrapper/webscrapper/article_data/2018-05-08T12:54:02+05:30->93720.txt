HYDERABAD: It turned out to be a bittersweet homecoming for speedster  . The Hyderabad lad, who had turned out for Sunrisers Hyderabad last season, was keen on helping Royal Challengers Bangalore stage a comeback in the tournament with a match-winning performance against the hosts on Monday night.

 
 
 
 
 
 Despite a good show with the cherry, the 24-year-old tasted disappointment as   lost a close match by five runs to kiss goodbye to their campaign this season. “This was a very crucial match for us and we needed to win this game but we lost it,” Siraj said on Monday night.
 
 Siraj has plied his wares on this ground and is quite familiar with the surface. “My only plan was to give as less runs as possible,” was his take on the strategy he had in mind. “However, I feel we gave away 20 runs more than what we should have. That made the difference in the end.”
 
 RCB’s bowling has been inconsistent while the batting has been their strength. But on Monday, it was a reversal of fortunes for them as the batting let them down. “It’s a part of the game. Ups and down will always be there. We are hoping to do well the next time,” was Siraj’s philosophical reply.
 
 With just six points from 10 games, RCB are virtually out of the contest. The only mathematical chance for them is to win their remaining four matches. “Whatever it is, we have to take it match by match. We will see what the situation is and take it from there. Hopefully, we get to win a few games from here on,” Siraj said.
