Nagpur: After the code of conduct for the civic elections come into force on January 11, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has chalked out an action plan to track political banners and  .

 As a part of this move, the estate department issued notices to all 13 firms involved in placing advertisements across the city. It has sought details from them on how many political hoardings they have erected and the revenue generated.
 
 “They have been asked to furnish details soon,” confirmed a senior official.
 
 Besides this, additional municipal commissioner Ravindra Kumbhare issued directives all 10 zones assistant municipal commissioners to remove all illegal political hoardings across their jurisdictions.
 
 TOI on Thursday noticed political posters in many localities, especially in north, south-west, east and west Nagpur, greeting citizens on New Year, which bear testimony to the extent to which politicians go to grab people’s attention.
 
 Political parties of all hues place their hoardings in every available space during election time, with the municipal corporation hardly bothering to remove them, even if they are violating the code of conduct. In the past too, the municipal corporation has been slammed for going soft on political parties by not them charging any fee or fine for political hoardings.
 
 The problem is likely to multiply as the election race hots up in the days to come. With only Laxmi Nagar and Dharampeth zones taking some actions, defacement of public property in other areas goes unchecked. With candidates for four seats campaigning in each ward, political parties will find it easy to communicate using banners and hoardings. Going by past experience, illegal hoardings will only increase as electioneering gains momentum.
