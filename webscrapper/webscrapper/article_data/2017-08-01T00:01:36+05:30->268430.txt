MUMBAI: Police arrested four persons for killing a 40-year-old man who intervened in a fight between them and a shopkeeper over non-payment of Rs 125 for an ice-cream they bought from his store in   on Sunday. 

 The four—Mobin Sultan (30), Jahid Sultan (21), Shoyeb Siddiqqi (19) and Mujahid Sultan (23)—fled the spot after thrashing the victim, Muzzamil Shaikh (40), to death and were later arrested from their houses. Another person, Abdul Shah, who too was present at the spot and intervened in the fight, was also beaten up by the accused.
 
 The incident occurred around 8.30pm when the accused and six of their friends—all drivers by profession—went to Sainath Dairy owned by Narpatsingh Rathod. “An argument started over payment of Rs125 for the ice-cream that the group had bought. On earlier occasions too, the accused had bought things from the shop but not paid Rathod,” said Sakinaka police station senior inspector Avinash Dharmadhikari.
 
 In the complaint, Shah said, “As the group was arguing with Rathod, Shaikh intervened and slapped one of the accused. The group then started beating him with rods and sticks. When I intervened, they attacked me too.”
 
 Locals rushed Shaikh to Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar where he was declared dead.
