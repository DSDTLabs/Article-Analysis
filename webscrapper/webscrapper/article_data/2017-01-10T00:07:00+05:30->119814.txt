PUNE: The body of a college student from the city was found in the dense growth near   close to Lonavla on Sunday morning, nine days after he went missing during a trekking expedition. 

 Mundhwa resident   (21), an arts student from a college near  , was part of a group of 15 college students who had visited   fort on December 30. He went missing during this expedition and police suspect he may have fallen off a cliff. 
 
 Lonavla rural police officials said, “A trekking group has been searching the area since December 30 to trace Narale. On Sunday, some local   and villagers were carrying an old canon to the fort when they stumbled upon Narale’s body.”
 
 Police said, “The college group reached Malavli from Pune by train and had started trekking to Lohagad fort on December 30. While climbing up, the group members realized that Narale was missing. The students conducted a long search before reporting the matter to police.”
 
 Lonavla rural police’s sub-inspector   said Narale, while trekking uphill, fell into the valley and nobody from the group realized it at that time.
 
 A group of trekkers recovered Narale’s body away from the cliff. “We found the body about 500 meters away from their trekking route among dense trees,” he said.
 
 Narale’s father is a defence employee posted outside Pune. He has two sisters and his mother is a home maker.
