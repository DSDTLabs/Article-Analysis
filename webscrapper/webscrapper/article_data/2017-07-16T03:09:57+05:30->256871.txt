NOIDA: A   clip surfaced on Saturday showing a middle-aged man choking a mongrel to death by pressing down on the animal’s neck with his foot near a marketplace in Noida. All the while, the man had a smile on his face.

 His wavering gait suggests he was drunk. The man is believed to be in his mid-40s and was wearing a traffic marshal’s uniform. This happened on Friday night near Sadarpur Bazar in Sector 45. 
 
 Police have launched a hunt for the man after a video clip of this cold-blooded cruelty, purportedly shot by a bystander, was widely shared on messaging platforms and social media. The authenticity of the video clip is also being ascertained. 
 
 Just a year ago, the horrifying video of a dog being flung off the fifth floor of a Chennai building was widely shared on the internet. The dog, later nicknamed Bhadra by his rescuers, has now fully recovered.
 
 Local residents said the man in the Noida video was tottering when he suddenly stepped on the sleeping dog, which tried to flee from the spot. The man, however, stamped on the dog’s neck and kept it there despite the dog struggling to break free.
 
 Bystanders made several appeals to the man to remove his foot but he did not. But no one came to the rescue of the dog either. Someone shot the video and shared it. SP (traffic) Anil Kumar Jha ordered an investigation into the man’s identify. Animal rights’ organisation People for Animals filed a complaint with Noida Police. The rights group said it will also complain to Union minister Maneka Gandhi.
 
 Ajay Kumar Singh, SHO, Sector 39 police station, said police were trying to establish the authenticity of the video. “We will identify and arrest the accused if the video is found to be genuine,” he said.
