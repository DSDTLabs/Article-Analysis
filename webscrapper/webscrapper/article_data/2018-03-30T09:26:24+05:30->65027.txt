 LONDON: Undergoing   surgery may not only help you lose the extra kilos, but also trigger a change in your relationship status, a study claims.

 Published in the journal ‘JAMA Surgery’, the research showed that bariatric surgery patients had a higher probability of getting married, separating from their partner or getting divorced. “This new study shows that other more personal aspects of the patient’s life may change after bariatric surgery,” said Per-Arne Svensson, associate professor at   in  .
 
 In the new study, researchers found that individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery are more likely to find a new partner or to get married.
 
 The study also reported an association between the degree of weight loss and the possibility of finding a partner. It showed that separations and divorces are slightly more common after a bariatric surgery.
