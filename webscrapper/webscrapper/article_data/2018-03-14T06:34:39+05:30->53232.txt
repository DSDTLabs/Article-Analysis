NEW DELHI:   chief General Bipin   on Tuesday said Pakistan was under sustained pressure due to the military stepping up its vigil along the Line of Control, while stating that countries in the Indo-Pacific region were looking at India to balance the rise of an assertive China.

 
 With Pakistan continuing to support the “proxy war” against India, the Army has adopted a proactive policy to dominate the LoC with targeted fire assaults and raise the ante for the Pakistan army-ISI combine. “If we want to raise the threshold, we can…We don’t want a ceasefire on their terms. We want it on our terms,”   said.
 
 This comes with the daily cross-border firing duels between India and Pakistan, which has seen light field artillery guns, anti-tank guided missiles and heavy 120mm mortars being used by the two sides, having blown away the ceasefire that came into force along the 778-km LoC and the 198-km International Border in J&K as a major confidencebuilding measure in November 2003. Ceasefire violations, incidentally, have already crossed 500 this year.
 
 Turning to China, Gen Rawat said, “The Chinese have finally arrived. I can say that. They did not forget that military power should rise simultaneously with the economy. ...As China has risen, countries have started looking up to India to see whether we can also become a nation that can balance the rise of China,” he said.
