Nagpur: Former minister and senior Congress leader   will lead around 200 farmers from his native Yavatmal district to New Delhi where a day-long protest fast would be observed on May 18 at Jantar Mantar.

 Addressing a press conference here on Monday, Moghe said the protest in Delhi was aimed at reminding prime minister Narendra Modi of the plethora of promises he had made to farmers at a nationally live telecast from the temple town of Dabhdi in Arni taluka on March 20, 2014. “He was just a prime ministerial candidate at that time. The way he organised the ‘Chai pe Charcha’ inviting farmers from across the country to Dabhdi and then promising them so many things influenced the gullible farming community all over the nation as they watched the live telecast.
 
 “Then, as soon as he became PM with the farmers’ support, Modi conveniently forgot his promises. This amounts to cheating. Not one of the promises he made has been fulfilled,” said Moghe. Farmers from Dabhdi and nearby villages will join the protest fast in Delhi to tell the world about their betrayal, he added.
 
 Among the unfulfilled promises are implementation of Swaminathan panel report on better prices for crops, low interest rates for farmers, setting up of godown at every village, creating processing units for farm produce and exports of garments from cotton produced in Vidarbha.
 
 “He had said he would improve conditions and that would end farmers’ suicides. Today farmers have no option but to end their lives as none of the promises made by Modi have been fulfilled in last three years of BJP government,” said Moghe. “Teen saal, kisan ka bura haal’ (three years of suffering for farmers) will be the slogan of the farmers at Delhi.
 
 Farmers will gather first at Sewagram Gandhi ashram from where they will proceed to Delhi by train.
