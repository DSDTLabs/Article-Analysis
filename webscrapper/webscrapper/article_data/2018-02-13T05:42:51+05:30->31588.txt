NAVI MUMBAI: A 37-year-old woman was allegedly murdered by her estate agent husband at their   home on Sunday. The   came to light after the woman’s sister went to her house on Sunday night to check on her and found her dead. The couple has a 14-year-old son. 

 The accused, Ganesh Nilakh (42), is absconding. He has been booked under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 Senior inspector Ajay Landge said, “We have come to know that Snehal (37) used to conduct private tuitions to keep the house running as the accused did not have a regular source of income and is an alcoholic. The couple fought often and Ganesh assaulted her several times.” 
 
 According to the police, the couple had a fight eight days ago following which Snehal and the child went to her brother’s house in Kamothe. They met again last week in Vashi at the funeral of Ganesh’s neice but after that, Snehal went back to her brother’s house. On Sunday, she went to the couple’s house in Vashi to collect her clothes and Ganesh reportedly again picked up a quarrel and beat her up. 
 
 “The accused hit her on her head with a grinding stone and stabbed her face with a pair of scissors. When Snehal did not receive her brother’s call, he asked his other sister who resides in Kopar Khairane to go to Vashi and check on her. The murder came to light around 8.15pm and the police was informed,” said Landge.
 
 Inspector (crime) Kisan Gaikwad said, “Ganesh has been booked as residents of the building saw him leave the flat in the afternoon. The victim’s brother, Yogesh Gadge (30), a Kamothe resident, is the complainant. The accused is untraceable as he has switched off his mobile.”
