Corporate companies often subscribe to the HR policy of not hiring siblings in fear that they may gang up on the rest. But then, who feels the need to corporatise Tollywood? This is where everyone who doesn't believe in the jhanda, gets the danda. The reins of an entire industry rest with the Biswas brothers with rhyming names -Arup and Swarup. They are the ultimate conscience keepers of Bangla cinema. When on Friday , state minister   chaired a night meeting with eight film industry representatives, there was a sense of relief. After all, even trash films have an ending and who wouldn't want a closure to the month-long drama over the ban imposed on the Dhanukas by the   technicians and Workers of Eastern India? Though   has officially no stake in  , the Tollygunge MLA has long been the de facto chief of the film industry and has had warring parties kiss and make up. I hear that even He Who Must Not Be Named had to hug bete noire  , when Big Brother wanted it. After hearing everyone out, Arup suggested that the Dhanukas apologise to the Federation, headed by Swarup, and persuade him to get the ban lifted. I am hoping Swarup is ready to patch up, as that's what Big Bro wants, it seems. It looks like this might be the (un)happy ending to the drama for now. Moral of the story? Big Brothers are closely watching you.
