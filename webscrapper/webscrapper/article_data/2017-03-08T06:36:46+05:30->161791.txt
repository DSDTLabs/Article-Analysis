 The complaint of  , 43, a resident of Isanpur and owner of a chemical unit in Narol, says he came across Stavan Altisa scheme on the 100 feet road by Sambhav Infrastructure, in 2013. The firm, owned by Mihir Desai and his wife Toshal, agreed to sell a unit at Rs 70 lakh and Yagnik made the first payment of Rs 10 lakh by cheques.
 
 “Yagnik says that when he went to the scheme in 2015 after its completion and insisted on getting the sales deed, Desai asked him to wait,” said an investigator. “In the meantime, Yagnik visited the unit and was shocked to learn that someone else, later identified as Malhar Mehta, was already living there.” When Yagnik confronted Desai, the latter said that he needed money and was forced to sell the unit. 
 
 “Desai, however, promised to compensate him and give him another unit in another scheme Stavan Parishram,” the investigator said.
 
 But Desai’s cheques bounced and Yagnik checked the legal status of the new unit he was being offered — that too had been given to someone else. Anandnagar police said that probe had been initiated.
