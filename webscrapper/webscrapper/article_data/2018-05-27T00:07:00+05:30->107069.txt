What makes you feel comfortable and beautiful. Wear what feels nice to you, not to impress. 
 
 
 A good pair of jeans is a must, white T-shirt, black dress, flat cool shoes that you can walk/run in as well, comfy jacket to keep you warm when needed – especially if you’re taking a flight. 
 
 
 
 A cotton dress is my go-to option. 
 
 
 
 I take a friend who knows my style, go to a particular store and shop for an hour. If I’m not done, I come back another day – but as a rule I don’t 
 shop for more than 1 hour at a stretch. 
 
 
 Drink plenty of water, get eight hours of sleep and laugh your heart out. I do believe that laughter is the best medicine – it cures everything. 
 
 
 I don’t know why but I can’t get myself to like animal prints. It’s a strict no-no. 
 
 
 
 I have never committed a big blunder – thank god! But no one is perfect. I have had my share of bad days. During an event, when I suddenly realised that the dress doesn’t quite fit the way I would have liked it to, but I had no option but to go with it... bad reviews for my look on that very day didn’t help!
 
 
 Going OTT is very passe. I like to keep it natural and carry my own attitude. That’s always a winner. 
 
 
 
 Just don’t pick (the pimple)!
