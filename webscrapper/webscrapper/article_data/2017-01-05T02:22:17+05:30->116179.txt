NAVI MUMBAI: Panvel City Municipal Corporation will start implementing Local Body Tax (LBT) from January 1, said civic chief Dr Sudhakar Shinde. A meeting was held on Tuesday with NMMC’s   department.

 But the   has opposed the move, as ‘implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) will make LBT null and void’. The Taloja MIDC units were paying tax at a very low rate to the gram panchayats. Taloja Manufacturers Association president Sandeep Dongare said that   insists to go ahead as it wants to show the state and Centre the LBT revenue receipt amount. “Once LBT is replaced, they will claim the amount as compensation,” he added. The eligible units will have to register with the   to pay LBT.
