It was not just another red carpet fashion showdown at the  , as Hollywood’s biggest and brightest stars turned up in all black to support the  , an anti-sexual harassment initiative. But it was not just the women, but also the men, who did their bit to stand firm for the movement and proudly wore lapel pins and ditched the white tuxedo shirt in favour for an all-black suit.

 Everyone from  ,  , Common,  ,  , Chris Hemsworth, Robert Pattinson, Golden Globe nominees   and Denzel Washington, among others stuck to the dress code as they attended the event held at the Beverly Hilton, in Los Angeles, California.

 While many have lauded the men for standing up for the cause and supporting the movement, there have been a few who questioned what the fuss was about, keeping in mind that the men ‘already wear black’ to award shows. “I’m so inspired by men wearing black to the Golden Globes, an event to which they’d normally wear black tuxedos. It’s part of the storied man tradition of making the least possible effort but expecting credit anyway,” read a tweet.
 
 Others kept a watchful eye on the carpet to see if stars like Matt Damon (bashed for his insensitive comments on the on-going sexual harassment debate), Casey Affleck (accused of sexual abuse in the past), Jeremy Renner (infamous for refusing to speak about pay disparity in Hollywood), among others, attended the show in all-black.
