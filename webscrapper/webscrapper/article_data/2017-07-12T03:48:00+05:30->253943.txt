Panaji: Meat traders in Goa have welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision to suspend the ban on the trade of   meant for slaughter.

 The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended Madras High Court’s order to the rest of the country, putting an earlier notification on hold.
 
 The Centre had issued a notification banning sale and purchase of cattle from animal markets for slaughter on May 23. The environment ministry had notified the stringent ‘Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Markets) Rules, 2017’ under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.
 
 The move, however, received backlash from meat traders across India, many of whom moved court demanding that the rule be scrapped.
