Ahmedabad: Highlighting the importance of a balance between affordable healthcare and quality services, experts at the 12th edition of a three-day conference organized by the Indian Society of Hip and Knee Surgeons (ISHKS) said that the Indian drug price regulator must take into consideration the quality of healthcare services. As for the decision of the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) to impose caps on the ortho-implant prices, ISHKS members believe that the regulator must review the decision so that it does not hinder the advent of new technology in India.

 Dr Rajesh Maniar, president, ISHKS, said: “The regulatory body has a positive intent. However, one must understand that there are premium implants available across the globe and a price cap regulation may be a hindrance in introducing them to the Indian market.”
 
 Dr Daniel Berry, a consultant at the department of orthopaedic surgery, Mayo Clinic in the US, said: “It is important to attain a balance between access to affordable healthcare for the masses and the availability of new technology that suits the patients. It is important that patients don’t lose out on quality healthcare due to regulatory issues.” ISHKS 2018 was organized in Ahmedabad for the second time. The conference drew more than 500 orthopaedic surgeons and experts from across the country. “The motive of such meetings is to train, educate and guide doctors and identify newer technologies available in the market and make them available to patients,” said Dr H P Bhalodiya, a joint replacement surgeon and organizing chairman of ISHKS 2018.
 
 Bhalodiya said that the government must make it it mandatory to build a registry for joint replacement surgeries so that adequate information about patients as well as quality and effectiveness of implants can be identified. Currently, ISHKS is maintaining such a registry through their members.
