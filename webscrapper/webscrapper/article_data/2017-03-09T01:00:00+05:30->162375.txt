 While the students enjoyed thoroughly, faculty members also had a great time playing games like football, volleyball and dodge ball. Not only did they participate in these games, they also played other interesting games like lemon and spoon race, three-legged race, sack race, dahi handi and hoola hoops, among others. Swati Singh, an Economics teacher from the college, said, "It’s always fun to be a kid again. While students are having their fest and rightfully investing in sports activities, why can't we be kids again?”
