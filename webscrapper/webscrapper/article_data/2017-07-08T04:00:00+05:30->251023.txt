Vadodara: The city cops went into tizzy when a man called up the police control room and said that his brother had opened fire on him in Wadi area on Friday morning. However, it turned out there was no firing incident. 

 After receiving the call from Naresh Kanojiya, the control room passed on the message to the concerned cops patrolling in the Wadi area who rushed to the spot. But they couldn’t find Naresh. The police then called up on the mobile number from which Naresh had called. 
 
 “Naresh picked up the call and said that he was near SSG Hospital. The police rushed there but he had disappeared. The cops again called him and this time he said that he was near a private hospital on Sindhwai Maata Road. The police team then went there,” the police said. 
 
 The cops called him again but he didn’t respond to the phone calls. He was finally nabbed when he reached a police chowky in Wadi. When questioned, Naresh said that his brother Rajendra had entered into fight with someone. 
 
 He told the police that when he refused to intervene in the fight, Rajendra fired at him on Dabhoi Road. When Naresh gave them two different locations of firing, the cops got suspicious and questioned him further.
 
 Naresh then told them that he was under medication in the mental hospital. The cops believe that he is mentally unstable. He was later handed over to his family but no offence was registered.
