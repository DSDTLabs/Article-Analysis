Theatre was what occupied his mind, even while   was working as an advertising professional abroad. 

 One fine day, he realised that his passion mattered to him more than anything else, and he quit his job and returned to Kerala. The first thing he did was make a social media post, inviting freshers who love theatre, to form a theatre group. To his surprise, he received an overwhelming response. After conducting a few rounds of auditions, Sujith formed Kapila, composed of a handful of theatre aficionados. Among them are IT professionals and businessmen.
 
 Kapila now has 15 artistes, three of whom women, and will stage its first play   in Kochi, tomorrow. “Probably, it was for the first time that there was a casting call for theatre via social media,” says Sujith. “Except for me, all our artistes have day jobs in various fields. So, we have been meeting in the evenings for the past few months and doing rehearsals. A workshop was also held for them soon after the auditions, as most of them are new to theatre,” says Sujith. The team plans to take Hamlet to stages even outside Kerala in the future.
 
 Service professional Akhil A P, who does the protagonist’s role in the 1-hour-30-minutes production, was previously part of the comedy TV show Thatteem Mutteem. However, it’s his first attempt at theatre. “I applied seeing the ad in social media and it has been an exciting experience. The workshop in particular taught me how to behave, react and conduct myself on stage.”
 
 The costumes for the play have also been put together by the artistes themselves. “I believe that’s how it should be, so that everyone’s genuinely involved in the whole process,” Sujith says. The team is planning a play based on mythology next and hopes to give it a better reach than Hamlet.
