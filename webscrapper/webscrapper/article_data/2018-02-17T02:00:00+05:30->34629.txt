Siliguri: Union minister and Darjeeling BJP MP S S Ahluwalia threw his weight behind fugitive Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief Bimal Gurung in a desperate bid to renew support of Gurung loyalists in the Hills before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

 “I stand by Bimal Gurung and will oppose extra-judicial efforts to eliminate him,” the Union minister said on Friday in the foothills at Matigara. Ahluwalia will inaugurate a Passport Seva Kendra on Saturday. 
 
 Ahluwalia’s comment drew flak from Gorkhaland Territorial Administration chairman Binay Tamang, who demanded his resignation from the MP’s post. “Ahluwalia is coming to his constituency after eight months. He should first tender his resignation and seek apology from the Hills people, failing which he might face protests,” Tamang said. 
 
 Ahluwalia held that Gurung-led GJM is still a BJP ally and promised to provide all help to save him. The Tamang-led GJM called it the Union minister’s ploy to gain back a foothold in the Hills. Tamang supporters pointed out that the Darjeeling MP had gone missing when the Hills people passed through their worst of times during the 104-day agitation in the Hills. 
 
 Even other leaders such as Harka Bahadur Chhetri had openly questioned Ahluwalia’s absence and said during the agitation that BJP has to pay a price for leaving the Hills people in the cold.
