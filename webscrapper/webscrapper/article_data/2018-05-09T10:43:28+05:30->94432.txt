VIJAYAPURA/KOPPAL: Prime Minister   
  said the Congress had lost faith in its chief Rahul Gandhi’s ability to win elections, and has roped in his mother,  , to at least save its candidates’ deposits.

 
 Addressing an election rally at Sarwad village in Vijayapura district, Modi said he had 
  watched an interview of a Congress leader who said the son (Rahul) “will not be able to do anything." 
 “If you bring the mother (Sonia) to Karnataka and she does something, then maybe deposits can be saved. This is what Congress leaders have started saying,” he said.
 
 Hitting back at political pundits for predicting a hung assembly in the state, Modi said instead of preparing the survey report sitting in AC rooms, they should come out and see the huge crowds braving the scorching heat at the rally. “It indicates BJP will emerge the single largest party,” he said, adding that Congress was already finding fault with 'faulty EVMs' for its 'impending defeat'.
 
 Three ministers of state, who don’t know anything about Basavanna’s principles, camped in Delhi to divide the religion and retain their seats. Stopping short of taking names, Modi said, “The irrigation minister has looted money conniving with contractors, who travel by helicopters. This shows how corrupt they are.”
 
 Later, addressing a rally in Koppal, Modi accused the CM of caste discrimination. “While BS   had developed Hampi to promote the rich heritage of the region, Siddaramaiah discriminated among children and only children of a particular caste were taken on an educational tour to Hampi and other places. The government also neglected the development of Hampi,” he alleged.
 
 The PM said the Centre has come out with Swadesh Darshan Scheme and earmarked Rs 5,000 crore for it. “Anegundi and Hampi will also be developed under the scheme,” he said.
