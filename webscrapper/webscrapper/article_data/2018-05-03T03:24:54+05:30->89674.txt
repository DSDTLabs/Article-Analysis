NEW DELHI:   on Wednesday restricted the movements of a   by women students, after he refused to leave the campus. 

 The court directed the JNU to ensure Professor Atul Kumar Johri doesn't take charge as warden of any hostel housing women and that he refrains from interacting with students. It also asked the professor not to visit laboratory no. 409 of the department of life sciences where the students work. The directions came after JNU's counsel informed the court that Johri had resigned from administrative work and was no more the warden of any hostel or member of any committee. Justice Rajiv Shakdher questioned the varsity on absence of any women in a fact-finding committee set up by the vice chancellor to probe the professor's alleged misconduct. "In my view, it is also in the interest of the professor to reduce the chance of interaction with the complainants or potential witnesses," the judge stressed, telling the university to consider if Johri can be sent out of the campus once the fact-finding committee gives its findings.
 
 "These directions are made on the stand taken by JNU's counsel to provide a safe working environment to the petitioner students," the court noted, while hearing a petition filed by several women students seeking suspension of the professor, against whom eight FIRs have been lodged alleging sexual harassment. tnn
