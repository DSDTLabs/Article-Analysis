Tirupur: After a major fire broke out at a shop selling chemicals used for making fireworks on Eswaran Koil Street on Wednesday, the district administration has directed tahsildars to identify such shops across the district. However, the administration is not likely to shift the two shops selling the chemical situated on the busy street as demanded by local residents. It was not mandatory for the shopkeeper to obtain the required license as barium nitrate and potassium nitrate sold in the seventy-year-old shop fall under non-explosive category, a senior revenue department official told TOI. “The chemicals, which could be used as ingredients for making fireworks, are not dangerous if they remain separate from explosive materials. The fire did not cause much damage to even the adjacent buildings. It shows that the chemicals stored there were not dangerous,” he said. “However, the district administration has sought a report about the shops selling such chemicals across the district. They plan to sensitise shop owners on the importance of adapting precautionary measures to prevent fire accidents. Also, fire safety drills will be conducted at such places,” the official added. The authorities would have reacted differently if the fire accident caused deaths or injuries, Aam Admi Party spokesperson S Sundarapandian said. “Those two shops may have been operating for many years but the population in the area has gone up. It is risky to allow them function on such a busy market,” he said.
