NOIDA: A 22-year old man suffered injuries after allegedly being shot at by two bike-borne criminals in Noida's Sarfabad village on Friday, police said. 

 Mohit, a resident of Sector 22, Noida, was returning home from a hotel when the attack took place, police said. He was rushed to Kailash Hospital for medical treatment.
 
 "He was returning on a bike when two persons on a scooty started following him. They asked Mohit to stop but he refused. The criminals then opened fire. Mohit has sustained injuries in his leg," a police official said.
 
 Mohit lost balance and fell off the bike. Some locals alerted the police and informed his family about the incident. The attackers, meanwhile, managed to flee the spot. 
 
 "Prima-facie it seems a case of personal enmity. We have registered a case against unknown persons. We are scanning the CCTV footage of nearby areas to identify and arrest the criminals," Abhinandan, circle officer, Noida, said.
