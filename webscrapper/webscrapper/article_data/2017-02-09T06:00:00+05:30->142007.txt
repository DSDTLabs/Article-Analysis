Tomorrow is going to be a special day,” said Virat Kohli, speaking at the press conference after the team’s practise session on Wednesday morning.
The members of Team India looked to be in high spirits as they went through their paces under the watchful eye of Indian coach  . After a warm-up session, the players were seen going through the fielding drills. 
 Having beaten England convincingly in the recently concluded test series, the Indian team is the clear favourite in the match. But Virat believes it will be an equal contest. “You can’t discount Bangladesh, they have some quality cricketers. They did exceedingly well against   scoring 350 runs in a day recently. One session or one hour of good cricket can change the match. We have been able to win games because of our persistence and discipline and we will focus on doing the same,” added Virat.
