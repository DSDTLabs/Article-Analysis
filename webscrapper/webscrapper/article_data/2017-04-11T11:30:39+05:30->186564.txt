PANAJI: National Fishworkers’ Forum on Monday decried shipping minister Nitin Gadkari’s allegations that protest from environmental activists led to the halt on capital dredging at   (MPT) causing losses worth Rs 250 crore to the exchequer.

 According to   members, capital dredging work had commenced in the MPT navigation channel to deepen it from about 14 metres to 19.5 metres over a approximately 0.25km to 10 km area, although environmental clearance had allegedly been granted only for maintenance dredging.
 
 NFF vice-chairperson Olencio Simoes and Old Cross Canoe Association Owners Co-operative Society Limited president Custodio D’souza pointed out that the work was halted after   (NGT) on September 2, 2016 quashed the exemption from public hearing granted to the dredging project by the ministry of environment and forests (MoEF), saying it was illegal.   had noted that the exemption was arbitrary and in violation of the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006. 
 
 The mandatory hearing will now be held at   in Vasco on April 28.
