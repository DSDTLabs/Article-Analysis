National award-winning director Srjit Mukherji, who makes his Bollywood debut with ' ', the Hindi adaptation of his Bengali film ' ', is known for being extremely thorough with his research. While shooting the Vidya Balan-starrer, he decided to keep the look of the characters real. And for that, the cast was advised to use minimal make-up. 
However, some of the girls would cheat and turn up on the set with an evidently caked-up face. Srijit, being the taskmaster that he is, would notice it instantly, and check everyone’s make-up before shooting. Srijit recalls, “It became a ritual for a few days. I was like a school teacher who would check make-up and nails. I used to sit with wet tissues and wipe off all the extra make-up. Since the story is set in a different world, I didn’t want them to have heavy make-up and manicured nails.”
