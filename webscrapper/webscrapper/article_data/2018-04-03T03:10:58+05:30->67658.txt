DIALGAM (J&K): It was a six-hour denouement that ended in a hail of bullets, and a young man, barely out of his teens, dead inside a house surrounded by security personnel while his parents who had tried to talk him into surrendering waited nearby for news of the inevitable.

 Rauf Khanday, believed to be a   militant, was killed on Sunday at Dialgam village in south Kashmir's   district.
 
 The beginning of his end started around 11 pm on Saturday when the police wireless buzzed. It was an intercept about the presence of two terrorists inside a house. After ascertaining the identity of the terrorists, the house was cordoned off by security personnel and they were asked to surrender, said an official.
 
 One of the militants did so immediately leaving young Khanday inside, cut off from the rest of the world. Then followed the hours of trying to talk to Khanday reason with him and even bringing in his parents so they could convince him to surrender.
 
 "I tried everything that is possible to make him surrender. But every effort of mine was stonewalled by the young boy, who had been brainwashed," said senior superintendent of police, Anantnag, Altaf Ahmed Khan.
