MUMBAI: Israel has proposed a radical upgrade of security at  , from where five dreaded gangsters escaped exactly two years ago. The March 31, 2015 jailbreak prompted a survey, the results of which have now come in.

 The report was submitted to the Maharashtra government by a joint team of Israel’s defence ministry and the Israel   Services (IPS). The recommendation is for a new system comprising advanced gadgets, dogs, double fencing, and electronic bracelets for prisoners.
 
 The prisoners’ escape from the 151-year-old   jail had led to the suspension of then jail superintendent Vaibhav Kamble. The five had earlier, led by gangster Raja Ghouse, fled from an MP prison.
 
 The Israeli survey was done between July 10 and 15, 2016 to map threats according to local and global trends. The team found existing security— CCTV cameras, an alarm system, wireless communication, etc —at the jail to be inadequate. 
 
 It mapped three major threats affecting the prison: inmates’ attempted escape; smuggling of drugs and contraband into jail campus; damage to security by inmates.
 
 A senior jail official said, “Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis visited Israel in April 2015. There, he also discussed the issue of jailbreaks and poor security in Maharashtra‘s prisons. Now that the Israeli report has been submitted, it is likely to be implemented soon.”
 
 Feedback has been sought from jail and home department authorities.
 
 The survey’s report suggests breaking inmates’ routine, and initiating operations against suspected terrorist activity without warning. Such operations will increase uncertainty among inmates and prevent them from making joint plans, the report says. The recommendations include establishment of a jail intelligence system, an inmate assessment system, a physical security ring, a system to monitor prison entrances, check guards’ alertness, and a canine squad.
