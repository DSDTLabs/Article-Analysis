IMPHAL: In a challenging task to bring about   across the state in the next five years, the state cabinet has decided to launch a mission to provide employment, housing and drinking water for each household by 2022. These points were voiced by   leaders during their hectic canvassing in the just concluded assembly polls. 

 A cabinet meeting convened on Wednesday evening, with chief minister   in the chair, resolved that the mission will be based on three pillars - community mobilization, transparency and universal coverage - with the primary focus on cluster based approach. Funds will be leveraged under various centrally sponsored schemes.
 
 A statement issued by   information and public relations said the mission aims to provide 100 percent employment, housing and treated tap water in selected clusters of villages covering all the blocks of the state. The mission is proposed to be implemented in five phases, with a total tentative target of covering around 7.5 lakh households in terms of providing gainful employment, 86,000 households for housing and 4.6 lakh households for treated drinking water, said the statement.
 
 At present, there are over 7 lakh educated unemployed youth in the state, out of a total population of 28 lakh. The focus group for enhancing income levels through employment would be about 3.47 lakh households. The state is among the worst performers in the north-eastern region with regard to living conditions and access to drinking water, with just 16% households having access to piped water.
