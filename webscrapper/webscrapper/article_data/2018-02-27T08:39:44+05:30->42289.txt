CHANDIGARH: The   and   high court on Monday observed that it was in favour of creating a corpus   for Panjab University (PU) to cope up with its financial exigencies.

 
 While making these observations, a division bench comprising Justice A K   and Justice A S   was also of the view that such corpus would help the university in managing its finances without turning to the Central or state governments for funds.
 
 Meanwhile, the Punjab government also informed the bench that the state would pay this yearâ€™s deficit of Rs 17 crore to PU. The court was also informed by Punjab that the state government has agreed to an annual 6% increase to its share. The bench asked the state authorities to ensure compliance of these assurances.
 
 
 The matter is pending before the high court in the wake of a suo motu cognizance taken by it on September 8, 2016, about financial troubles in PU. The cognizance was taken on a detailed note of Justice Mahesh  .
 
 
 In his detailed note, Justice Grover had asserted evidently if the doom was predicted so soon, the institution must be in a state of decay already. Justice Grover, who is also a PU alumnus, had also observed in his note that he was venturing to take suo motu notice of the serious state of affairs, particularly the apprehension of the vice-chancellor on shutting down the university for lack of funds.
