SRINAGAR: Terrorist outfit   (LeT) threatening Kashmiri women on Monday to be prepared for “consequences” if they did not observe the “Islamic dress code”. 

 It circulated handwritten posters, asking women to follow a “Taliban-type dress code” — that is, a burqa, which leaves just the eyes exposed. “Kashmiri women, particularly from   district, are resorting to waywardness. 
 
 So they need to observe Islamic dress. Even the hands of the women should not be exposed,” read the posters, which bore LeT stamps. Police didn’t make much of the posters, but said they would keep an eye out for “for any kind of mischief against girls in south Kashmir”, a senior officer said.
