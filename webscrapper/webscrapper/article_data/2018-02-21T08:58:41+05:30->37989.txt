SURAT: Police arrested a 19-year-old youth from an area under the limits of   on Monday for his alleged   to copy data of   and provide them to   in Mumbai. The scamsters used the stolen data to develop cloned debit cards to steal money from bank accounts of customers. 

 Police arrested a resident of Sarthana Sagar Dhameliya on Monday night. The accused was going on a scooter when the police stopped him near Moti Nagar Circle. Police found a device in his scooter, which he told them was meant to be installed in an automatic teller machine. Dhameliya was booked at Sarthana police station for trying to fix an exterior device to an ATM on a complaint lodged by Dena Bank manager Ramesh Chaube.
 
 He told police that he was paid a salary of Rs 60,000 per month for two months to fix the device as per the directions received from a person named Raj, who was based in Mumbai. 
 
 Dhameliya used to install the device in the ATM’s debit card slot and instructed to remove it after two or three transactions. He targeted the ATMs where no security guards were present.
 
 The device recovered was a sophisticated instrument that got fixed into the debit card slot of the ATM accurately. The debit card data reader was embedded in the device and when an account holder swiped his card into the slot, the data got copied from it. The accused used a mobile phone and pasted it above the ATM keyboard to take video of an account holder entering his or her PIN while using the ATM. 
 
 “The accused was provided the device by a man based in Mumbai and earned per month salary of Rs 60,000. Once the other accused are also arrested, it will become clear how many frauds together they have committed,” deputy commissioner of police, zone I, R P Barot said.
 
 Dhameliya, who has studied up to class IX, earlier worked as a diamond polisher. His father still is a diamond polisher. He got in contact with Raj through a common friend named Rushi from the city.
