PATNA: Expressing grave concern over the reported apathy of the authorities of the state government as well as   (PU) towards university’s centenary celebrations, the   has urged   to intervene in the matter and use his office in expediting the celebrations at the earliest.

 Association convenor Nawal Kishore Chaudhary said, “It is a good thing that the state government is celebrating the centenary year of Gandhi’s Champaran satyagarh on a grand scale. But, at the same time the government should also have taken pains to hold the centenary celebrations of PU, the seventh oldest university in the country. The celebrations should have commenced on October 1 last year, but it is yet to commence owing to the authorities’ indifference. The history of PU has been the history of the growth of higher education in Bihar as most of the present-day institutions have come out of the womb of PU.” 
 
 Loknayak Jayaprakash Narain, poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, the first chief ministers of Bihar and Bengal, namely, Srikrishna Singh and B C Ray, besides a galaxy of freedom fighters, politicians, bureaucrats, legal luminaries, and academics have been its alumni. 
 
 “Union ministers like Ram Vilas Paswan, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Jagat Prakash Nadda and Upendra Kushwaha besides chief minister  , RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, education minister Ashok Chaudhary, chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh have all been the alumni of this premier university, but they did not take any interest in holding its centenary celebrations,” he said.
 
 Chaudhary said it is high time PU is accorded the status of a central university and its ancient glory is restored.
