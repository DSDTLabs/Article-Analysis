KOLKATA: The   government is moving to bring sweeping changes in the state's   procedure.

 The government plans to remove all private adoption centres in the state and replace them with authorised government adoption homes. The   department has already started formulating plans in this regard.
 
 Initially, four government homes will be transformed into state adoption agencies. This step is being taken keeping in mind the frequent instances of child and newborn   which has been plaguing the state.
 
 West bengal has 28 adoption centres but they are all privately-owned.
 
 At present, the   (CARA) oversees child adoption process throughout the country. Recently, CARA released a report which pointed out a startling discrepancy between the number of orphans in the country and the number of children in orphanages and adoption centres.
 
 In light of this alarming data as well as the recent cases of trafficking, the state women and child welfare department decided to change the existing norms.
