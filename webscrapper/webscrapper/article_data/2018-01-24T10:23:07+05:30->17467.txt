BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh government sent out mixed signals on   after Supreme Court rejected MP's bid to reinstate a ban on the release of the controversial film. While chief minister   said that it's not a question of law and order but "public sentiments", home minister Bhupendra Singh Thakur said the administration will abide by the SC order. 

 "We have filed a review petition in the honourable Supreme Court to reinstate the ban on the movie in Madhya Pradesh. We have pleaded that this is not a law-and-order problem but a question of public sentiment, therefore we should be heard," Chouhan told reporters in Bhopal on Tuesday. After a pause, he repeated that it's only because public sentiments are involved that the state is seeking a review. 
 
 "We have pleaded that sentiments of the public and community should be respected," said Chouhan. He reiterated his stand during a programme in Jabalpur later in the afternoon.
 
 On the other hand, Bhupendra Singh, who had earlier said that even playing the songs of Padmaavat is "violation of rules", assured on Tuesday that the government will follow the SC order. "We shall abide by the SC verdict on the screening of the movie. We will also maintain law and order in the state after the release of the film," he told reporters in bypoll-bound Mungaoli. The apex court has made it very clear that states are obliged to maintain law and order after the release of the movie.
 
  For all its talk about the ban, the MP government is yet to issue a formal order prohibiting the release of the film.
