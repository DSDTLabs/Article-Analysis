LUCKNOW:   candidates who fought the Assembly elections in UP have advocated going it alone in future in the state, beginning with the civic polls due in June, a press statement issued by the UPCC in Delhi, said. It was issued after a meeting of these candidates with the party’s central leadership in the capital.

 Congress had fought the polls in UP in alliance with the  , fielding candidates on 125 seats.
 
 The AICC had called a meeting of the defeated candidates of the party to Delhi to ascertain their views on the party’s humiliating performance in the assembly elections and how to go to the civic polls in the state. The party was reduced to seven seats from 29 in a state where they have been out of power since 27 years.
 
 The UPCC release stated the view of majority of candidates was that the party should go to the civic polls alone.
 
 National general secretary and UP in-charge   and the UPCC president Raj Babbar had a more-than-four-hour-long interaction with the party’s candidates who had lost the elections. “We have apprised the central leadership that the decision to go for an alliance with Samajwadi Party, while neglecting district and state level leaders proved suicidal. It should not be continued and we should contest the forthcoming civic polls on our own,” a few candidates who attended the meeting in Delhi, told TOI over phone.
 
 The views of the participants of the meeting would be presented to national vice-president Rahul Gandhi for a final decision, said UPCC spokesperson Dwijendra Tripathi.
