CHENNAI: A   developed on the   in Thousand Lights here on Tuesday due to the   boring work. 

 The crack was spotted close to the median where the road caved in on Sunday. A bus and a car were trapped in the crater on Sunday.
 
 After the crack was spotted on Monday, the area was cordoned off and repairs began. 
 
 Traffic slowed down because it happened during peak hour. However, police had not diverted vehicles. 
 
 Officials said the crack developed because of settling of soil due to boring work underneath the road to build tunnels to DMS. 
 
 Traffic moved at a snailâ€™s pace on Anna Salai in the morning.
 
 Those motorists proceeding to Egmore and Beach were caught in the traffic jam for a while in the morning. But traffic was normal in the afternoon.
 
 "Since the crack was developed near the median on Anna Salai, motorist were not affected much" said a senior police officer.
 
 "They were bit hesitant to cross the stretch in the morning. However,   authorities have rectified the crack applying cement" the officer said.
 
 
 
 
 
 Chennai Metro Rail is working to finish the last 1.7km of tunnel between Thousand Lights and DMS on the Washermenpet-Saidapet underground line.
 
 A statement from CMRL said workers were drilling the spot to find out if there was a hollow underneath the cracks. Grouting using concrete mix would be done on Tuesday night.
