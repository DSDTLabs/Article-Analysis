KOLHAPUR: The   ( ) has launched a special drive to keep a check on illegal passenger transportation, overloading of vehicles and non-possesion of   (PUC) certificates in this region.

 The national highway passes through three districts—Kolhapur, Sangli, Satrara—all of which come under the purview of Kolhapur RTO. The special drive has been launched till March 31.
 
 Illegal passenger transportation is rampant in the industrial areas and to keep a check on these activities is a major challenge before the transport office. It has a direct impact on revenue of services like   (MSRTC).
 
 Talking about the special drive, regional transport officer D T Pawar, said, “Apart from the regular action against illegal transportation, we have launched a special drive against vehicles that lack permit of passenger transportation. 
 
 Stricter action will be taken against overloading of vehicles. We will check compliance of vehicles with pollution norms. We will keep a watch on compliance of security norms in the school buses.”
 
 He further added, “Passengers should avoid travelling in illegal vehicles. They must enquire about the vehicle’s transportation permit as illegal vehicles do not have insurance. Such vehicles hardly comply with fitness norms.”
 
 Despite the action taken by RTO, illegal transportation continues to flourish in the rural parts of these districts. The negligence of RTO officials has led to the rise in illegal transportation.
