THANE: Though a slight nip in the air was felt just two months ago, the cold winds have already started retreating from the   and surrounding areas.

 Meteorologists attribute this rising   to the recent cyclonic circulation in the north western region of India coupled with the increase of the warm south easterly winds coming in this direction.
 
 Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at a private Indian company that provides weather forecast, said, “There has been a cyclonic circulation of the cool northerly winds in the Rajasthan area over the past few days. These winds usually blow towards the south, cooling this area in the process. Instead, the western pockets in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region are now receiving the warm easterly winds coming from the Bay of Bengal.”
 
 Palawat added, “While these winds have made the climate here warmer, the mercury levels will have a slight drop of around two to three degrees Celsius for the next 24 hours before ascending once again. This is an indicator of the slow fading of the winter season. As the onset of the winter season was delayed up to late December and it is already showing signs of retreating, this is one of the shorter winters this region has seen.” 
 
  From a minimum temperature of 16.2 degrees Celsius earlier this month to a consistent minimum temperature of 23 degrees Celsius this week, the mercury level has already begun its ascent. Meanwhile, the maximum temperature touched 37.2 degrees Celsius on early this week. 
 
 Hrishikesh Sathe, a 26-year-old bird watcher and resident of Kopri, said, “This has been a very short winter. It not only started late, but also had a couple of fluctuating hot and humid days because of the cyclones, depressions in the Bay of Bengal and other such reasons. The winter migratory birds usually stay here during the cool weather right up till March. However, with the temperature rising, they may leave soon this year.”
