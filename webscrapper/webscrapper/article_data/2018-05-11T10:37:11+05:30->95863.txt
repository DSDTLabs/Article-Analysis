KOLHAPUR: A 56-year-old man was duped by two unidentified persons who posed as cops before him and looted his gold jewellery worth Rs 62,000, taking the total tally of such incidents to three in one week. 

 The modus operandi in all three incidents is same. The suspects impersonate as police officers by showing their identity card to the victims and ask them to remove their jewellery and cash for safety reasons.  , a resident of Talsande, Hatkanangle taluka, fell into a similar trap on Wednesday morning. He was passing on a road near a bridge adjacent to Wathar bus stand when two unidetified people on a motorcycle approached him and projected themselves as police officers on patrolling duty. 
 
 The suspects told him that a gang of chain snatchers and robbers are roaming in the area and asked him to keep all his valuables in a bag as a precaution. Todkar agreed and removed the gold jewellery he was wearing-a gold chain, two rings, a watch. The duo helped him remove the valuables including the Rs 12,000 cash that Sarjerao had on him, tied all the valuables in a handkerchief and handed it over to him. As he was on his way towards home, he checked the handkerchief inside which he only found his watch. Realizing that he has been cheated, he rushed to Peth Vadgaon police station and lodged a complaint. 
 
 "We have registered a case against unidentified persons under section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 170 (poersonating a public servant) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. We are gathering information about the incident and will nab the culprits. We have also alerted other police stations in the district to keep a vigil on those riding a motorcycle, wearing posh clothes and roaming suspiciously on less travelled roads," said a police officer attached with Peth Vadgaon police station.
