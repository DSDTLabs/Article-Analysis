NEW DELHI: Spotting a man with a liquor bottle may not be an unusual sight for the police in Delhi. However, a young officer recently used it as a lead to reach the den of two women bootleggers in northeast Delhi who used to smuggle hundreds of bottles of illicit liquor from Haryana and sell them in Delhi through their associates. 

 Posing as a customer, ACP (Seelumpur) Shashank Jaiswal asked the man to show him the place from where he had bought it. The IPS officer also informed the   and arrested both from their houses in Welcome. One of the accused, aged 38 years, has 56 FIRs lodged against her under the excise act while the other, who is 40 years old, was involved in four cases. The police said 384 bottles were recovered from the accused. 
 
 “On Thursday, around 2.30am, Jaiswal was out on patrol when he noticed a person riding his bike at a very slow speed while drinking,” said Ajit Kumar Singla, deputy commissioner of police (northeast). All policemen are taught the principle of ‘roko-toko’ but few implement it, he said. “But Jaiswal stopped the youth who eventually led him to the bootleggers.” 
 
 By the time the officer reached the spot, the woman who earlier sold liquor to the youth had shut all doors to her house and the police team, including women constables, had to jump the boundary wall of the adjacent house to get to her house. Getting scared, the woman let the police in and confessed about her crime, said Singla. She also told the team about the other woman who lived two houses away. “She was apprehended as well,” the officer said.
 
 They said they used to get liquor consignments from Haryana and sell them to bootleggers in Delhi and UP border areas.
