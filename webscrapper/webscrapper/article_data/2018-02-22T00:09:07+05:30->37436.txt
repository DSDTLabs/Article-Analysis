Indore: Applicants for driving licence will not be able to use same vehicles for driving tests which have been used by other applicants earlier.  The Regional Transport Office (RTO) Indore has restricted such usage after it was found that private agents were giving vehicles to licence applicant for driving tests after charging them a certain amount.  “Most of the vehicles being used by driving licence applicants belonged to private agents. They were providing the vehicles to their clients and charging fees for it,” said RTO Jitendra Singh Raghuvanshi.  He said that they have instructed the staff engaged in conducting driving test not to allow any applicant to sit for the test if he or she is using a vehicle which has been already used by any other applicant on the same day or day before appointment.  “The appointment of aspirant will be cancelled if they will be found using any such vehicles. They will have to re-apply for the test,” added Raghuvanshi. Officials said that it had become an avenue for the agents to generate revenue by offering both four wheeler and two wheelers on rent to aspirants of driving licence who were not able to arrange vehicles.  Sources said that the agents were charging Rs250-500 for providing vehicles to their clients. “The practice was common especially for applicants of four-wheeler driving licence,” they pointed.  RTO staff have also been instructed to make sure that vehicle has all compulsory accessory such as rearview mirror and registration number plate with clear marking of its registration numbers on it. “Using a vehicle without number would also lead to cancellation of the appointment,” they said.  On an average, around 120 people apply for driving licence at Indore RTO. It includes 60 percent applicants of two wheeler category while remaining 40 percent are of four-wheeler category.
