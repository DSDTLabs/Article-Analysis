Panaji: The meteorological centre at Altinho, Panaji, has issued an   alert to state government agencies, warning them to be prepared for any eventuality.

 The centre is expecting heavy to very heavy rainfall in varying proportions across different parts of the state till Wednesday morning and has alerted state authorities about it. “The colour code gives an idea of the type of preparedness required,” M L Sahu, director, meteorological centre, said.
 
 While a red alert warns the state agencies to be “ready”, taking into consideration the severity of weather conditions, the orange alert is issued when rainfall is heavy to very heavy.
 
 A red alert has been issued along the Odisha coast in view of the atmospheric depression along the coast and Bay of Bengal, urging authorities to initiate action. 
 
 While a yellow alert signifies that the agencies should be watchful, a green one conveys that there is no warning.
 
 On the IMD website, the colour-coded alerts are shown on the map of the country. “While we send messages by mail and fax, the colour code instantly conveys the type of preparedness required,” Sahu said.
