JAIPUR: ' ' - the catchphrase of Rajasthan tourism department proved true for a few Taiwanese tourists travelling on Palace on Wheels (POW) on a four-day trip till Jodhpur from Jaipur. The Taiwanese tourists who were eager for a royal experience on the famous Palace on Wheels (POW) were in for a rude shock on Thursday when they were forced to put up in a normal AC 2-tier coach as the super luxury train was over-booked. 

 The 17-member Taiwanese group, accompanied by interpreter  , boarded the train from Jaipur. They had booked tickets for a four-day royal journey to Jodhpur via Chittorgarh and Udaipur at the rate of $1300 per person per night.
 
 "However, in Jaipur, an old POW coach was attached next to the generator van which did not even have electricity and water. Subsequently, we were put up in a normal AC 2-tier coach. It was only well past midnight on Thursday that we were allotted three cabins in POW. But these accommodated only six persons," said Yadav.
 
 "POW is a very expensive experience in terms of money. But look at my room, it is so small, has no shower,'' complained Wu-Wen-Chin, one of the tourists, in broken English. 
 
 He said he will complain to the Taiwanese embassy once he reaches Delhi. Till Friday night, the group managed to get eight of the nine cabins they had booked. Wu-Wen-Chin and Yadav are still waiting for their cabin. 
 
 Pradeep Bohra, consultant general manager of POW, however, denied that the tourists were cheated. TOI on Thursday had carried the story, "A 1st: Extra coach for overbooked Palace on Wheels", wherein   had euphorically claimed that the POW was overbooked for the first time and an extra coach from the   on Wheels' (old POW) was added to accommodate 84 passengers against its capacity of 82.
