NEW DELHI: A private   carrying schoolchildren turned turtle in Mangolpuri of outer Delhi around 8am on Tuesday. The van was going towards   in Rohini with 15 primary class students when the   took place. Two kids suffered grievous injuries and had to undergo surgery.

 A preliminary probe has revealed that the driver of the Maruti Eeco, bearing registration number DL 8C AW 3092, was signalled by a traffic policeman to stop for checking of documents. In his bid to escape, the driver steered the car towards the right, lost control and crashed into the divider near Mangolpuri furniture market.
 
 The speeding car turned turtle and the kids got trapped inside it. Locals rushed to the vehicle and pulled out the children after breaking open the rear windshield. They were taken to a nearby hospital where most of them were discharged after being provided first aid.
 
 However, two of the students — Kanishka and Vansh — suffered serious injuries and were rushed to Jaipur Golden Hospital. Kanishka was treated for injuries sustained on the face, while Vansh was operated upon for a head injury. Both are out of danger.
 
 Family members of the children rushed to the spot after getting news about the accident.  , a resident of Mangolpuri whose six-year-old son was in the van, said, “The accident occurred barely 15 minutes after the van had left our place. My son didn’t suffer any injuries, but three of his friends were injured.” He added that the driver usually ferried 18 children to the school.
 
 Senior police officers said that the van driver has been arrested for dangerous driving and causing hurt. The vehicle also had a roof carrier on which the schoolbags of the children were kept. This also made the car lose balance easily.
