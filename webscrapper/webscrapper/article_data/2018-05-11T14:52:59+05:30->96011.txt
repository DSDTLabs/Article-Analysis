PANAJI: The Goa   on Thursday sought to differ with PM Narendra Modi and BJP president   on their assurances on the   issue during the poll campaign in Karnataka.

 Addressing a press conference at the party’s state headquarters in Panaji on Thursday, state BJP spokesperson and South Goa MP   said the Goa BJP had faith in the inter-state water dispute tribunal which is adjudicating the dispute.
 
 Asked to react to Shah’s promise at a poll rally in Hubballi that the dispute would be resolved within six months of BJP assuming office and that water from the river would flow into Karnataka, Savoikar said, “He (Shah) has said the issue will be solved immediately after (BJP forms the government). As far as we are concerned, the matter right now is before the tribunal. We will rely on the tribunal award. Both states have placed their say before the tribunal”.
 
 The tribunal is set to deliver a verdict in a few months. Mahadayi originates in Karnataka and meets the Arabian Sea in Panaji after flowing through Maharashtra.
