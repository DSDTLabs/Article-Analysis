KOLKATA: The West Bengal   set up by the   government in 2012 for recruitment of staff to Group B and C posts, may be merged with   (PSC) for cost curtailment and better utilisation of manpower. Recently, the state finance department asked for a merger of 20 state undertakings and restructuring of 46 public sector undertakings. 

 The state government has not appointed any chairman for the selection commission after IAS officer K S Rajendra Kumar’s tenure ended on April 30. Kumar said the method of applying for jobs and interaction with the commission was simplified for the applicants.
 
 According to a sources, the decision to merge is being considered as the PSC has enough manpower and expertise in recruiting, though a part of its power was curbed in the past five years. An official said the selection commission act has provisions for dissolution of the body, while PSC is a constitutional body. 
 
 The selection commission was set up to accelerate the recruitment process, however, the completion wasn’t always quick. An official pointed that the state government is not keen on appointing a new chairman, though an IAS officer is under consideration.
