NEW DELHI: Expressing deep concern over the fraud detected in  , a Parliamentary panel has said that the supervisory and regulatory roles of the board of the bank and the   needs to be looked at.

 
 Parliament’s standing committee on finance, which submitted its report to both Houses of   on Friday, also urged the finance ministry to take corrective measures and bring regulations to plug loopholes and ensure that such incidents do not take place.
 
 The panel said, “In such a scenario of regulatory failure, the current re-capitalisation exercise of banks may end up as throwing ‘good money after bad’.”
 
 Last month, finance minister   had slammed regulators, along with bank managements and auditors, for their failure to detect frauds, saying “politicians are accountable but regulators are not” — a statement interpreted as signalling the government’s displeasure over the RBI’s failure to scream fraud in the Rs 12,600-crore PNB case.
 
 While urging the government to instil confidence of customers and investors in the credibility of state-run banks, the panel also said there is a need to “rub aside the cry to privatise PSBs”. It also said the time has come to ensure scrutiny of large loans in the cooperative sector.
