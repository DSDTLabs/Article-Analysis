COIMBATORE: Whistleblower S Jeyaraman has petitioned the governor and other senior officials saying the original documents and proof he had submitted before the Coimbatore   have gone missing. Nearly a year ago, he had filed 10 cases with the consumer court and submitted the documents with original proof on October 24, 2016.

 The 70-year-old man had over the years filed more than 150 cases. “I have filed several cases and such an incident has never occurred. We often submit case bundles with original proof. The head clerk produces them before the judge and then we are given a serial number. The documents are returned to us. But this time, I got only seven bundles back. When I questioned, they said they would check and let me know. Later, I was told that I submitted only seven bundles and not 10. But I had taken photocopies of all the documents I submitted,”   said.
 
 When TOI contacted the clerks at the consumer court, they said, “We have held an internal enquiry but we could not find the bundles. There is no proof that he submitted 10 bundles.” 
 
 They added that the case bundles that has allegedly gone missing were small cases related to consumer complaints on shopping markets. tnn
