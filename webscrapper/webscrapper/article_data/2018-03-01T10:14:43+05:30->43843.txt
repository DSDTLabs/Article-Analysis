HYDERABAD: The   (TRS) has charged the   at the Centre with neglecting farmers. "The Centre does not even have the minimum knowledge that MSP for different farm produce was fixed 12 years ago. It is not even conscious that it has to revise it. This only goes to show the anti-farmer policies of the BJP-led NDA government," government whip in the council Palla   said. 

 As much as 40,000 TMC of water is going waste in the country only because the Centre has not even thought of taking up irrigation projects, he said. "The Centre is showing showering sops on states which are going for polls. This is what we have seen. Is this the way the Centre should function?" he said. 
 
 Rajeshwara Reddy said the TRS and the BJP had no relationship whatsoever. "We will not tolerate injustice against Telangana and we will fight it out. We are for Centre-state relationship as enshrined in the Constitution. We will continue to demand for our rights," Rajeshwara Reddy said. He said it was shocking that the BJP and the   were being critical of farmers' association meetings that were being organised by the Telangana government. "Their criticism only reflects how much they are against farmers' interests being protected," he said. 
 
 The TRS leader charged Congress leaders with adopting 'rowdy politics'. "How dare they describe farmers coordination meetings as 'rowdies' coordination meetings'? This shows what regard they have for farmers," he said. "Both the BJP and Congress should not be allowed to come to power at the Centre. It will only be detrimental to the interest of the people of the country," he said.
