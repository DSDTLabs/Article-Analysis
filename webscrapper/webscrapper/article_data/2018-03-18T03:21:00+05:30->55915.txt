Vasco: The Goa   Owners Association has decided to block the Mandovi river navigation channel on Monday to protest the government’s failure in providing relief post the Supreme Court order that brought mining activities in the state to a halt.

 The association’s president, Raymond D’Sa said, “We will be joining the protest along with the North and South Goa associations of truck owners. We shall be blocking the navigation channel at Mandovi river for a day.”
 
 Eighty barges will participate in the protest. D’Sa said, “We went to the ministers and almost begged for help. This is the crucial time for business, especially due to loans.”
 
 Asked whether the protest will not affect the casinos, D’Sa said, “Goans are badly affected due to the SC order. Casinos are run by outsiders. There is no harm if their business gets affected for one day. The government should also realise our sufferings.”
 
 D’Sa said banks have started troubling them for repayment of loans. 
 
 Association member Chandrakant Gawas said, “We are only showing our concern and requesting that mining resume soon.”
