NEW DELHI: Police have arrested a 21-year-old youth who allegedly used to issue challans to commuters by posing as a   police constable in north Delhi’s Kotwali area. Police said the imposter, Vicky, was issuing challans at traffic signals for a week. “He posed as a traffic policeman and usually operated in the evenings. He even had a   ID card,” said Jatin Narwal, deputy commissioner of police (north).

 Police said a sub-inspector on Saturday noticed something fishy about Vicky’s behaviour and confronted him. He asked him for his ID card and, on closer examination, found it to be fake. “He tried to escape but was stopped,” said Narwal. 
 
 The accused is a resident of Gonda in Uttar Pradesh. He admitted that he hoped to earn a quick buck and had procured fake IDs and dress. “He had looked up for images of identity cards on the internet and got one made accordingly. He brought his uniform from Kingsway Camp. He managed to earn about Rs 500 every day,” said a police officer.
 
 Police are trying to get more details about the case and also looking into whether Vicky operated alone or was a member of a bigger gang.
