Surat: Humiliated by local district officials for his continuous follow-up on taking up Swachh Bharat Abhiyan at Bahumali building, RTI activist Rajesh Modi has now knocked on the doors of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for justice. 

 Modi has lodged a complaint with the Prime Minister on the central public grievance portal for gross negligence by Surat district administration on maintaining swachhata at Bahumali building in Nanpura, which houses key government offices. Modi wrote that he has been following the issue with district collector and the revenue secretary of the state for the last six months, but no action has been taken. 
 
 After repeated attempts, district collector Mahendra Patel deployed a team headed by deputy collector MM Parghi to inspect the building on April 3. Modi, who was invited by the administration to be with the team, was literally humiliated after he gave suggestions. 
 
 Modi told TOI, “Around nine out of 10 people living in the city have to visit Bahumali building as it houses key government offices. It is pathetic to observe the building from inside. I wrote a series of emails and letters to top authorities, but no action has been taken. I felt it is the duty of government officials to work on PM’s Swachh Bharat Mission, but the officers felt offended.” 
 
 The moment you enter Bahumali building, rows of unused government vehicles can be seen rotting inside the premises. It is interesting to stare at the dead old furniture rotting either near the gangway or at the side of the staircase. Many offices looks like a junkyard. The uneven flooring at the premises provides little parking space to the visitors. One comes across filth and muck lying on the staircase and the sidewalls are painted with paan and gutka spittings. At times, a peculiar smell of urine emanates from each floor of the building. There is no emergency exit on the top floors.
