Trichy: With drainage and sullage continuing to merge in the Uyyakondan canal, an environmentalist group has planned to file a public interest litigation (PIL) to draw the attention of various stakeholders to its rampant pollution. Claiming that apathy towards safeguarding the “freshwater body” has affected the quality of cultivable lands relying on the canal in Trichy and Thanjavur districts, the environmentalist lamented that development works taken up at an estimated cost of Rs 11 crores in Uyyakondan a few years ago had failed to safeguard the 1,000-year-old canal. According to the eNGO Thanneer, Trichy corporation as well as the public works department (PWD) had altogether failed to prevent drainage from residential and commercial establishments merging with Uyyakondan at at least 8 major points. “Corporation claims that beautification drives are going along the Uyyakondan banks whereas the quality of water in the canal is at its worst. Since the stakeholders are not taking any action against the buildings letting out waste into the canal, we have planned to lodge a PIL,” K C Neelamegam, secretary, Thanneer said. The organisation pointed out that funds worth Rs 11 crore were spent on rebuilding the canal between 2014 and 2016 raising questions on the outcome of redevelopment works except for the fencing provided along a stretch of the canal. “The monthly review meeting of Uyyakondan Protection Committee to discuss the proactive measures taken by the stakeholders has not been conducted for months now. We have demanded that the district administration convene the meeting,” Neelamegam added. The environmentalist also lamented that no action was taken against defaulters at points where drainage and sullage merged with Uyyakondan including Lawson’s road, Raja Colony and Palakkarai. Reacting to the demands of the NGO, sources in the district administration said that efforts were under way to convene Uyyakondan Protection Committee within a fortnight.
