NAGPUR: Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court reserved the plea filed by ousted leader of opposition (LOP) in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)   for judgement.

 The division bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and   heard arguments from all sides at length before closing the case.
 
 Earlier, former advocate General  , appearing on Tanaji Wanwe’s behalf, defended divisional commissioner’s move to appoint Wanwe, who ousted Mahakalkar on May 19, claiming support of 16 out of 29 Congress corporators in the NMC. Subsequently, Kumar appointed Wanwe on the basis of numbers of corporators supporting him.
 
 The commissioner in his affidavit to the court informed that he received application on May 16 which shows that voting took place in election of Wanwe as new LOP. In the process, out of 29 elected members, 17 voted in Wanwe’s favour. Even if 16 members signatures were verified, still the majority were with Wanwe, he said.
 
 Subodh Dharmadhikari, who pleaded on behalf of Indian National Congress (INC) and   committee (MPCC), contended that political party in municipal corporation would always be an affiliate of original political party at centre or state. He also questioned mayor’s powers to recognize Wanwe even as Mahakalkar was unanimously elected by all the corporators earlier.
