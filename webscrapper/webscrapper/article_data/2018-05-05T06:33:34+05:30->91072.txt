PANAJI: Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited ( ),   operators and the directorate of transport have begun coordinating in order to improve the efficiency of public transport in the state. The three stakeholders agreed to coordinate over bus timings on various routes in the state to ensure that there are no clashes, and that public are not inconvenienced.

 At the first meeting of the coordination committee held on Friday, KTCL and private bus operators agreed to submit a consolidated list of all its bus routes and timings, along with permits, to the transport department to check for clash of timings, as well as identify routes where there are a lack of buses plying. “We also want to find out where these gaps exist, so that passengers don’t suffer,” general manager KTC   said.
 
 The problem of private buses not plying on Sundays and holidays was also raised, and suggestions were made as to where buses could ply on rotation basis so that passengers are not left stranded. The transport department asked private operators to be more disciplined and stop overloading passengers, if it wanted the directorate to stop issuing them challans. The issue of noise pollution was also raised at the meeting, and drivers were asked to use their horns sparingly.
