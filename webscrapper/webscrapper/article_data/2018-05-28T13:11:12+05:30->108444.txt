KOCHI: Police have taken a couple into custody after the body of their child was exhumed from a compound close to the   inspector’s office on Sunday morning.

 
 Earlier on the day, the woman had approached the police alleging that her husband had killed the three-monthold and buried the body. Police had taken him into custody based on the women’s claims.
 
 However, the couple was inebriated and kept changing statements, said the police.
 
 The couple has been identified as Sudha (27) of   (32).   claims to be from Palakkad and speaks both Tamil and Malayalam.
 
 “The woman told us that the child had asphyxiation when she was feeding him milk on Saturday night. The husband had then buried the child after finding that the baby was dead,” said the police.
 
 “We have not believed their version. We are waiting for a forensic surgeon to conduct a postmortem,” said a police officer.
 
 Ernakulam Rural SP Rahul R Nair had visited the spot.
 
 Biju Paulose, local ward member, said that the couple has been wandering in Angamaly for over a year.
 
 “They used to sleep in front of shops. We have seen them making ruckus often after getting drunk,” said Paulose. Police have registered an FIR under unnatural death.
 
 “The inquest was done under the supervision of revenue divisional officer. Postmortem will be conducted on Monday,” said Angamaly subinspector Noble P J.
 
 Officials said that no visible injuries were found during the inquest. Police said that the couple is under custody and further action will be initiated only after receiving the autopsy report.
