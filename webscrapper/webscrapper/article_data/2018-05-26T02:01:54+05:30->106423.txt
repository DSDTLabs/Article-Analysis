GHAZIABAD: A   of Rs 15 lakh has allegedly been sought from the wife of an   engineer, who had gone   from ALT crossing on the night of May 23. The 35-year-old   was working with a software major in Ghaziabad. A   team, including a circle officer has been rushed to Haridwar, the hometown of the engineer, said sources.

 According to the police, the engineer, a resident of Nandgram’s Radhakunj, hired a cab from his office in Sector 126 around 11pm and got down at ALT crossing around 12.30am to board a bus to Haridwar on the night of May 23. He was going home to celebrate his 35th birthday with his family. His wife and two children had left for Haridwar a few days ago. However, soon after getting off from the cab, he became untraceable as his mobile phone was switched off.
 
 On Thursday morning, the engineer’s brother-in-law, a resident of Patel Nagar, filed a missing complaint at Sihani Gate police station. Later, around 10.50pm, the engineer’s wife received a message from her husband’s mobile number which read that she had to deposit Rs 15 lakh if she wanted to free her husband.
 
 Police tried to locate the engineer’s location by going through the footage of the CCTV cameras installed in the area from where he had to board the bus. However, it is still not clear whether the engineer boarded the bus to Haridwar or not.
 
 The police department as well as the engineer’s family are tight-lipped about the entire incident. The case is being handled with caution to ensure the safety of engineer. Several teams are simultaneously working to locate the engineer, said a senior police officer.
