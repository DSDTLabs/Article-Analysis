LUCKNOW: Patient care services at King George’s Medical University’s urology department remained disrupted on Sunday for a few hours when resident doctors of the department asked   of a 22-year old patient to take him away, for alleging that the doctors had conducted an improper operation on him. Following chaos and intervention of department seniors, it was decided that the patient will be re-operated on Monday.

 A resident of Basti and son of a farmer, Vijay Shanker was operated by junior doctors of the department last week for stones in kidney. Post-surgery ultrasound, however, revealed the stones were still present and another operation was required. Panic gripped the attendants and grew further when the patient’s urine started leaking from the tube in the kidney and the staff allegedly refused to change the dressing. Attendants too claimed that junior doctors had given them forcibly a discharge slip citing attendants’ choice to do so as reason. 
 
 The hassled attendants contacted police on the UP100 number but when seniors from the department and   administration intervened, calling it a miscommunication between residents and attendants, police were kept at bay. “I was informed about the disruption and contacted immediately the head of the department,” said Dr  , medical superintendent, KGMU. “I had a word with the residents. There has been a problem but we will sort it out and give best treatment,” said Prof S N Shankwar, head of the urology department. 
 
 Dr  , who treated the patient, said, “Sometimes it happens that kidney stones are not found in the first operation and a second setup is done. A gap is required between the two operations. In the meantime there was some leakage from the tube drilled in the kidney and it caused panic. There was just miscommunication between operating junior doctors and the attendants.”
