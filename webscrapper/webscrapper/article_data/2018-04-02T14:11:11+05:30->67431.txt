PANAJI: Acquiring information about cartazes or permits issued to ships and shipmen in the Portuguese regime will no longer seem like gaping into an abyss of the past. Detailed and systematic indexing of this information is being done by the archives department as per dates and details of visitors furnished in the centuries-old files.

 “These records will give us an idea of the kind of trade that took place between Goa and the tradesmen. We are carefully studying the cartazes before indexing them so that research scholars will be able to trace the required information with ease,” said archivist  .
 
 A total of eight volumes of such cartazes, each spanning hundreds of pages, are found in the archival treasure trove of the department.
 
 Besides guaranteeing the licence and security of a ship, the cartazes served as records in the Portuguese period to document who was coming into Goa and for what trade. These records specified which place the applicants were from and whether they were affiliated to any ruler. The cartazes, therefore, served the purpose of a kind of visa.
 
 “The Portuguese-ruled Goa had trade relations with the Saunde kingdom and the Sawants of Wadi. Merchants from the kingdom of Tipu Sultan, Hyder Ali and the Mughal dynasty also traded with Goa via the sea route and so did local players from Mangalore, Surat and Cochin. These permits reveal vital information about the same,” said Shenoy.
 
 The indexing done so far has revealed Goa’s trade relations with Armenians and Turks, besides traders from   (in Iran).
 
 The department is also in the process of indexing 120 files detailing the work of freedom fighters in Goa’s struggle for liberation from the Portuguese. These files contain proceedings against freedom fighters, reasons for trial and durations of imprisonment among other details.
