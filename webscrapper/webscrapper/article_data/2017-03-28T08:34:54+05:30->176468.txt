 Rakesh Chand Gehlot was pushing a barricade away near Aerocity around 10pm when a Honda Amaze driven by one Sanjay Kumar hit it. The impact flung Gehlot backwards and he crashed on the ground, neck first. 
 
 CCTV footage from the area revealed that Kumar pulled over and checked on the injured policeman. Thinking him to be dead, perhaps, Kumar dragged Gehlot to one side of the road. A PCR van passing by saw him and signalled him to stop.

 Kumar told the police during interrogation that he had left home after having a few drinks. 
 
 Family members of Gehlot said he had been promoted as a head   only a few months ago, after 27 years of service as a constable. He was previously posted with the security unit of Delhi Police. Only six months ago, he was transferred to the airport police station.
 
 Traffic policemen having increasingly come under attack from errant drivers. Only a few months ago, a 27-year-old traffic constable was crushed by a speeding truck in Mahendra Park, northwest Delhi. The driver was trying to flee when flagged down during an anti-drunk driving check.
