Pallavi Sharda, who grew up in Australia, and shifted base to Mumbai in 2010 to be a Bollywood actress, admits that despite being an NRI, she wanted to be a Hindi film actress since the age of three. The actress who will be seen playing a sex worker in Srijit Mukherjee’s 'Begun Jaan', revealed, “I grew up watching 'Lamhe' and 'Chandn'i. I was inspired by   Dixit and  . They were my Goddesses. My uncle used to call me Pallavi Devi after Sridevi’s character in 'Lamhe'. My father was a film buff too. I have actually grown up watching classics like 'Chupke Chupke', 'Teesri Kasam', 'Madhumati', 'Do Aankhen Barah Haath' and 'Sangam'. Bollywood films were magical to say the least.”
