Visakhapatnam: Beach nourishment plays an important role in restricting coastal erosion, particularly during summers. Beach nourishment, or beach filling, is the practice of adding sand or sediment to beaches to combat   and increase beach width. 

 The rate of coastal erosion rises during pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, owing to inclement weather conditions such as formation of low pressure, depression, deep depression and even cyclones. From April to June in India, the pre-monsoon or cyclonic seasons as per India Meteorological Department (IMD), Bay of Bengal witnesses such weather conditions. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, IMD director (forecast) Dr K Naga Ratna said that during the pre-monsoon season, particularly in April and May, sea conditions are rough under the influence of low pressures and cyclones. 
 
 In the 2017 pre-monsoon season, the cyclonic storm Maarutha formed over south Bay of Bengal and was relatively short-lived. This was followed by cyclon Mora, which too was short-lived. Besides, low pressure systems were also formed over the sea that led to high tides. Rough sea conditions lead to abnormal wave movements that is one of the prime reasons for coastal erosion at places like  , said a senior scientist from the department of oceanography.
