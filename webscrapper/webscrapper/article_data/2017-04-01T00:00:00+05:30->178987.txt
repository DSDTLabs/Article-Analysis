Actor   is known for undergoing drastic makeovers to perfect his roles. 

 After beefing up and growing a beard for  , the actor is now on a crash diet to cut off those extra pounds, to enact a 63-year-old. He will play M T Joseph, the father of child prodigy Edmund Thomas Clint, in his biopic titled Clint. 
 
 The film has Unni playing two time frames of Joseph’s life, as a 35-year-old and a 63-year-old. The first schedule of the film, in which he is seen as the younger Joseph was completed last month and now Unni is preparing to shoot for the older version. The actor has already lost eight kilos. Ask him how and he says, “From 84 kg, I am now down to 76 kg. I wanted to specifically reduce my facial fat and get rid of my double chin so that I can do justice to the older look of Clint’s dad. To add perfection to the look, the team is working on my outfits. I will be wearing loose clothes so that I will look leaner.”
 To shed the flab, Unni is now doing a one hour workout daily, which includes jogging, in addition to a strict diet. “I have stopped taking sugar, rice, meat and dairy products. My breakfast is oats, badam and honey. I eat roti and fish curry for lunch and salad for dinner. In between I have fruits and salads,” Unni says.
 
 The actor’s other projects include Avarude Ravukal, Bhagmati and Ajay Vasudevan’s Mammootty movie.
