LUCKNOW: Commuters had a narrow escape at   railway crossing in   when an overhead electric wire (OHE) broke down after coming in contact with a dumper on Saturday. 

 Around 7am, a dumper loaded with mud crossed the railway level crossing after the gates were opened. But while crossing the tracks, the high angles fitted on the roof of the dumper broke the OHE and it came crashing on the tracks.
 
 At that time scores of vehicles were passing through the crossing, but none came in contact with the broken OHE. The gateman at the Magarwara crossing immediately informed the Northern railway control room and the movement of trains was stopped on the route. 
 
 The movement of 15 trains, incluing 11 Memu, between Lucknow-Kanpur was affected as it took railway staff more than six hours to repair the broken overhead electric wire. 
 
 Most of the trains were stopped midway near Orai, Gonda and Barabanki route. 
 
 The four prominent trains that got delayed were Bhopal-Lucknow Express, Amritsar-Howrah (9 hours late), Kota-Patna (8 hours late) and   (6 hours late).
