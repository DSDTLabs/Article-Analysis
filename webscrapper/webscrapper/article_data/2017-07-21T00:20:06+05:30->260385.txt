Thiruvananthapuram: The talks convened by chief minister   here on Thursday succeeded in ending the stalemate between the private hospital managements and nurses. The 22-day-long strike by nurses was called off after it was decided to ensure a minimum salary of Rs 20,000 to those working in hospitals with a bed strength up to 50.

 “The government has not taken a decision on minimum wages to be implemented in hospitals with bed strength above 50. For this, the government has agreed to appoint a four-member committee, which will submit a report in a month,” Vijayan told reporters after the talks.
 
 The committee, which will have the health, law and labour secretaries besides the labour commissioner as members, will also fix the training period for nurses and look into the revision of their stipend.
 
 Around 80,000 nurses in the private sector are expected to benefit from the decision. “The salary structure will be fixed by the minimum wages committee in the coming days after discussing with the managements’ association,” Vijayan said.
 
 Earlier, the chief minister held separate discussions with the hospital managements, nurses and industrial relation committee members.
