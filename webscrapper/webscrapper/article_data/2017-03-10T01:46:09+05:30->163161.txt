Patil had bagged nearly 15,000 votes which was way ahead of his rival from the Shiv Sena who was lagging behind with 9,000 votes in the recently-concluded 2017 civic polls.
 
 The suave corporator is also known for his aggressive style in the House when debating issues and was also vocal about the recurring incidents of corporators being targeted, following builder Suraj Parmar suicide case.
 
 Patil has set his eyes on the issue of water mismanagement and dilapidated buildings plaguing the areas that come under the corporation. “Along with forming a strong opposition that will keep a tab on the ruling party and the administration, I also plan to pursue the fast implementation of cluster development in Thane and solve water management issues,” he said.
