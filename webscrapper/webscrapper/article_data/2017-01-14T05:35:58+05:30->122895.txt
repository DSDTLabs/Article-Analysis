LUCKNOW: Barely 72 hours before nomination papers are to be filed for the first phase of polls, the Election Commission’s move to reserve order on SP’s symbol has left leaders and workers in a quandary. Even opposition parties are in a fix over the stalemate in SP as they are not able to plan their campaign.

 Both warring factions of the SP admit that they are running against time as they have little time left to hit the campaign trail. Candidates announced by both factions are a worried lot as there is no clarity on the symbol yet. “We have   as the face of the party, but we need to have a symbol soon,” said an   whose name figures in the list released by both Mulayam and Akhilesh.
 
 Political observers say the internal fight for the control over the party has sent other parties into a tizzy as well. Except BSP, no other major party has come up with its list of candidates.
 
 “Our political rivals are yet to release their lists. However, we have already given away half of the tickets,” says SP spokesperson Juhie Singh, who supports Akhilesh as the party’s national president. Admitting that the rift has hit the party’s campaign, she said, “The SP will begin the campaign once the   announces its decision.”
 
 Mulayam camp admitted that the deadlock had taken its toll on the campaign. “But the ground work is done and we will start our campaign as soon as the EC comes up with its decision,” says SP spokesperson  , an aide of Shivpal Yadav.
