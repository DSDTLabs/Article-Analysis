Renowned Indian author, economist, and journalist   launched his new book Anita Gets Bail at the   in Delhi on Tuesday, May 1.

 The event was a star-studded affair with former Chief Justices of India, R.M Lodha and A.P Shah being present. Veteran jurist Fali K Nariman released the book, published by  , in which the former Union minister deals with various judgements from the apex court to trial courts. Celebrated journalist   read out excerpts from the book. 
 
 Shourie's latest 
  is a book concerning the judiciary system of the worldâ€™s largest democracy that cannot survive without a fiercely independent and hugely efficient judiciary. Shourie's book explores how the demand for justice is vehemently increasing. The book charts out how Indian citizens have had enough of injustice and are hankering uproot all of the wrongs inflicted by the State, its authorities, or even by other citizens. 
 
 In a relevant discussion around the book and its theme, AP Shah termed the recent verdict of the apex court on the death of special CBI judge BH Loya as "utterly wrong, and jurisprudentially, incorrect on so very many counts". 
 
 He said that the apex court in the judge Loya case verdict had called it as a veiled attempt of attack on the judiciary and asked "How is asking for an investigation an attack on the judiciary?"
 
 "The system as a whole has evolved into something cold-hearted. Even with all this, the judiciary is still one of the last institutions that are respected, but that is changing," he said. 
 
 Shourie said if CJI Misra has to "say repeatedly that he is the master of the roster ... this already means that he has lost the moral authority".
 
 He also advocated that the executive should be checked in order to prevent "totalitarian control of every institution" and said "if you do not stop them, they will go on. Most institutions are eroded from the inside".
