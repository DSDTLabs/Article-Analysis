Even as she’s busy with Suriya’s film with   and Karthi’s film with debutant Rajat Ravishankar,   Singh has signed her next in Kollywood. She will be playing the lead opposite   in his sci-fi film with Ravikumar of Indru Netru Naalai fame. A source in the know says, “Rakul has had a narration and she was blown away by the script. Her role is different from what she has done before and is quite interesting. The concept of the film is different and it will have a universal appeal — something that will be liked by both, kids and adults, alike. Ravi’s last film,too, was liked, so she’s confident of this film as well. This genre — sci-fi — is also new for her.” The film is in the prep stage, and is likely to go on floors by June-July this year. The AR   musical is likely to hit the screens in 2019.
