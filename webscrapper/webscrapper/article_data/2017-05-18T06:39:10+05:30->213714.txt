HYDERABAD: While thousands of people   for  , many may not even be aware of what they are getting into. The lure of large sums of money tempts subjects to participate with little care for the consequences.

 For clinical trials, subjects have to give their permission, which is video recorded. Their signatures on required papers are also taken and video-captured. There are at least eight   in the city where drug trials are conducted, and all of them do take the consent of the volunteer on record.
 
 It is another matter whether subjects read the document that are given to them. TOI is in possession of a 31-page document that volunteers are expected to read and sign. While the   without even trying to understand the content, subjects with some knowledge on the matter go ahead and sign it as if the content is not important. Protocols that are to be in place are listed in the document.
 
 "All this is because of the money that volunteers are offered. There is no hard work involved for the subject. Sometimes the subject is required to stay in the laboratory for three days during which drug dosage is given. They may also be asked to come back for more dosages two or three times," a subject of a clinical trial said.
 
 There is also a clause that makes it clear that the subject should not have participated in any drug trials in the last three months. According to the protocol, people are supposed to keep details about their clinical trial drugs a secret.
 
 They are also not supposed to give out information to any other company or organization.
