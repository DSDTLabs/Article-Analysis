LUCKNOW: The   government faced strong criticism by the Opposition for its much publicized open defecation free (ODF) programme after the   Aradhana Mishra sought a detailed reply on the quality of construction of toilets in the state, cost of construction and lack of water in the newly built toilets. 

 As soon as the panchayati raj minister   informed the House that the cost of construction of one toilet was Rs12,000 and the state would be free of open defecation by October 2, 2018 as nearly 35 lakh toilets would be built in the next few months, members of the Congress, BSP and the SP stood up, challenging the quality and the number of toilets and also asked about the mechanism of constructing 35 lakh more toilets before October. Mishra argued that an amount of Rs12,000 was not enough to build a toilet. "Also, the government should check whether water is available in such toilets or the toilets are being made just for the sake of achieving targets. I have inspected a number of villages and districts and found that poor quality toilets of the government are not being used and people are still forced for open defecation despite government squandering so much funds for this programme".
 
 The panchayati raj minister, amid uproar in the House, clarified that funds were being released by the central as well as the state government from time to time and the state would be made open defecation free on October 2, 2018, as announced by the government of India.
 
 The BSP and the SP members also attacked the government by saying that the toilets were being built but there was no arrangement for availability of water, which was making this entire exercise redundant and asked the minister whether the government will sanction extra funds for the availability of water.
 
 The panchayati raj minister said there was no such plan for any special funds for the toilets being built by the government.
