Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation has gone soft on the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System Limited (DIMTS) and reduced its bank   from Rs5.39 crore to Rs3.25 crore. 

 Last month, DIMTS had approached the NMC’s transport department requesting its inability to deposit the agreed Rs5,39,62,772 and instead it stated that it may deposit only Rs89.96 lakh. 
 
 TOI recently reported that as per NMC’s agreement with DIMTS, the company was to monitor the city bus service for six years. The   guarantee was calculated on the basis of a monthly revenue of Rs6 crore from ticket sales which is being handled by DIMTS. 
 
 The firm was to ensure that 487 buses (including 55 green) ply and also 9 bus depots become functional. But, currently, only 310 buses (including 5 green buses) and four depots are being operated. 
 
 Both DIMTS and NMC’s transport department officials were not forthcoming on the reduced amount.
 
 The transport committee formed a five-member committee headed by mayor Nanda Jichkar, which on Thursday gave the nod to the legal adviser’s proposal to calculate the bank guarantee as per the current status of buses in operation and functional bus depots. 
 
 According to it, the bank guarantee comes to around Rs3,25,71,823. “This was accepted by DIMTS and the transport department,” said the source.
