MARGAO: In a late-night   on Friday, two individuals were arrested for their alleged involvement in flesh trade in a   bar. A 22-year-old resident of Hubballi, Karnataka, was rescued and sent to the state women’s protection home.

 Margao Town PI Kapil   said he was informed by his sources that a sex racket was being run in two basement rooms of Goa Lords Bar and Restaurant, that is situated at Salgaonkar Chambers, behind the   (MMC). 
 
 “We kept a watch for the last eight days, and on Friday at around 7.20 pm, we raided the premises and found the accused Justina D’Souza, 64, running the brothel in her bar. D’Souza had made two cubicles in her bar,” Nayak said.
 
 “The woman called up girls when she received requests from clients. Along with D’Souza, we nabbed Mohammad Anowar Rupin Ali, 22, a resident of Barpeta, Assam. Ali, who works in a hotel in Betalbatim, was found in a compromising position with one of the girls,” the PI added.
 
 The duo was arrested under provisions of the IPC and Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act 1956. The bar is close to a prominent girls-only convent school.
