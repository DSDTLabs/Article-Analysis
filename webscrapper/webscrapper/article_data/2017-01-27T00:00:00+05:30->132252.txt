In the last quarter of 2016, Bengalureans rolled up their sleeves and protested the construction of a proposed   from   to   for a number of reasons — destruction of heritage buildings, environmental concerns, and more. The #SteelFlyoverBeda campaign has reduced in intensity since then, so a few concerned citizens have attempted to revive it, albeit in a novel way — with a mockumentary.
Conceptualized by actor   and  , the six-and-a-half minute satirical video was released on January 25. It features comedian  , cricket commentator   and a few other Bengalureans who play fictitious characters who ‘support’ the construction of the flyover for bizarre-yet-funny reasons. Speaking about the video, Rajeev says, “We got the idea for this concept around mid-December, and chose   to get our message across for two reasons — one, because people had already chosen other mediums such as serious protests, short films and humour to show their contempt for it, so we wanted to do something different, and two, the kind of sarcastic, British humour in the video is something my team and I are good at. We also felt that now was the right time to release the video because the protests have kind of fizzled out and the government is going ahead with it, and we don’t want that to happen.”
 While the satirical nature of the video is entertaining, will it strike a chord with our politicians? “The authorities already know what the public’s stance is. This is just our medium of communicating the same. We like the fact that this video is sort of in the grey zone, and its interpretation is left to the viewer. While it’s not designed to confuse people and the authorities about our stance, if it so happens that we come across as supporting the flyover, then it’s a win for us because the underlying message is quite clear,” adds Rajeev.
