NAVI MUMBAI: The illegal burning of waste generated from civic gardens, instead of scientifically disposing it has irked the locals and activists in   taluka. 

 On Friday, the staff in charge of the Cidco Five Science Garden in sector 2, Kalamboli, had set a heap of trash inside the park on fire, leading to a lot of smoke and air pollution.
 
 “I have requested PCMC and Cidco to ensure that there is proper composting inside the gardens since that is the best way to take care of the solid waste which is mostly organic in nature inside the parks. However, it is disturbing to see garden waste being burnt leading to smoke and air pollution,” said activist  .
 
 After being informed about the illegal burning of waste at the  , the activist was told by the PCMC gardens in-charge, Tejaswini Galande, that the Cidco authorities are looking after this park as it has still not been handed over to PCMC.
 
 The Cidco executive engineer at Kalamboli, Girish Raghuvanshi said. “I will ask my officials to check if the waste had been set on fire. Then we will instruct the staffers to follow the proper procedure.” 
 
 Chauhan added that composting is done in all NMMC parks and gardens and the same should be undertaken in Cidco and PCMC areas.
 
 Composting involves the digging of a pit in one corner of the garden where all the organic waste like leaves, twigs are put and then covered with earth. After a certain period of time, the waste turns into manure, which can again be recycled for the garden thereby leading to an eco-friendly procedure.
