CHENNAI: The ongoing Candidates tournament in Berlin has been a keenly contested one. For  , it was yet another day of holding on to his slender lead as he heads to the final phase of the battle.

 
 The 25-year-old Italian-American Grandmaster drew with Ding Liren to be placed on 6 points at the conclusion of 9 rounds in the competition late on Tuesday evening. Caruana, who played with white, had to dig deep and put his best foot forward to split points against Liren in a battle that went on for 67 moves. Clearly, both the players gave it their all and it was only fitting that the honours were shared between the two. Liren is on 4.5 points.
 
 Caruana’s draw means he has a 0.5 point lead over Azerbaijan GM Shakhriyar Mamedyarov. Shakhriyar, on the other hand, had to settle for a 41-move draw with Levon Aronian. Along with Wesley So, Aronian (both on 3.5 points) occupy the bottom places in the eight-member field. Joining the two will be former World champion Vladimir Kramnik. He had to endure a loss at the hands of Sergey Karjakin. The 41-move affair saw Sergey - who was playing with the white pieces - up the ante when it mattered and script his win. While Karjakin is on 4.5 points, Kramnik remained on 3.5. Tuesday’s loss is bound to hurt Kramnik’s chances of giving the top prize a shot.
 
 In another match, it took 34 moves for Alexander Grischuk to split 0.5 points with Wesley So. Grischuk is third in the standings with 5 points. In the next round, Caruana will lock horns with Mamedyarov in what is being billed as the clash of the toppers.
