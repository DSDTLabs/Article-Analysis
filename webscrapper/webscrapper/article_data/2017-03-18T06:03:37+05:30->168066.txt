The Open Secunderabad Cantonment All Roads (OSCAR) community on Friday demanded a   probe into ‘grave’ irregularities in road closures and illegal constructions. 

 The association said that the   (LMA) in Secunderabad, and officers of the   (SCB) and the   (DEO) have been describing the closed roads as ‘military roads’, ‘A1 roads’, ‘internal roads’ to wrongly suggest that these are not public roads.
