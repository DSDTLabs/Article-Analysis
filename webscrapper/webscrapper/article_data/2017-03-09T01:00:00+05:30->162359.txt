The track will get spookier after Dhanu gets possessed by the ghost. It’s now left to Dinanath ( ) to rescue her with the help of Tanu and Manu.
Mohini is on a quest to track down her killers. She possesses Dhanu’s body as she is under the false impression that the Chauhans were responsible for her death. She does this as she recalls a car used by the Chauhans present when she died and tries to scare Dhanu’s husband, Shaurya ( ) and mother-in-law Suhasini (Dhurvi Haldankar). But when Mohini realises that they are innocent, she starts targetting other members as all of them had used the same car on the day of the accident.
 Says Anita, “Mohini is a South Indian girl and audiences will connect with her because of her accent. It was fun shooting this episode as Mohini creates horror-comedy in the show. I love doing comedy and this show has given me an opportunity to explore more of that genre. It was fun to work with the Trideviyaan. I hope my fans enjoy this new character.”
