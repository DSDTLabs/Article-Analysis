AGRA: Five students of   -- a   that gives diplomas to students who want to work in the leather industry -- in Agra have been   for allegedly sodomising their junior during a   and then continuing the assaults for months after that.
 
  The first instance of abuse had taken place in September last year, but the victim, a teenager, was too petrified to report the matter immediately to the authorities. Only after it became too much for him to ignore the violence did the boy confide in his parents, who then approached police some days ago. Acting swiftly, cops arrested three of the students on Tuesday afternoon. They are on the hunt for the two others. All of them hail from various parts of UP and have been charged under
  IPC sections 147 (rioting), 323 (causing hurt), 377 (unnatural offences), 504 (breach of the peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), 120 (concealing design to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) and the POCSO Act.
  
  Investigating officer in the case Sudhir Kumar said, “In the written complaint, the 15-year-old victim, hailing from Jhansi, had claimed that he was physically and mentally harassed. His seniors used to extort money from him and force him to strip and drink liquor.”
  
  Kumar added, The incident first took place in a private hostel that the victim and the accused lived in. The seniors harassed him for several months and sodomised him. After returning home on January 24, the victim narrated the ordeal to his parents, after which they filed a complaint with police.”
  
  The boy's mother said: “We met the principal of the institute and told him about the harassment they (the students) caused my son, but he refused to take action, saying the incident took place outside the institute.”
  
  Several attempts were made to contact the principal of institute, Bharat Singh, but he failed to respond.
