For  , the best thing about working in the television industry is that she can dabble in different formats of programming. The youngster, apart from producing shows, has also done anchoring and given voice-over for shows.

 Umera says, “I have produced shows like  , and given voice-over for Cinima. I have been anchoring   and   for  . I also get to host special programmes, like World 2017 and Kalloori Pongal. I think this is the biggest advantage of working on a versatile medium like the television.”
 
 Ask her if she has to prepare differently for the shows depending on the format, and she quips. “If I have to present news, then I need to be very formal and have a serious tone. But if I’m anchoring fun shows or giving voice- overs, then I can adapt a casual tone. Actually, there’s not much difference; I’ve to look into the front camera in the former, and it’s the back camera for voice-overs.”
 
 So, does she prefer anchoring over being a voice artiste? “My friends have told me that I’ve a good voice and that I should try doing voice- overs. I love doing both, though I’d like to do a lot more anchoring,” she signs off.
