Trichy: Public Works Department (PWD) has taken up the project to repair the integrated collectorate complex of Trichy, inaugurated in 2010 by former chief minister M Karunanidhi. The complex has been in need of repair work due to the poor method of construction in several parts of the building even though it has been only seven and half years since its inauguration. The inferior quality of the construction had already come to light few years back with the plasters coming off gradually.  The collector office sources said that there was a hurry to complete the construction of the building on about one lakh square feet space at the cost of Rs 12 crore in 2010 before the assembly elections in 2011. The former deputy chief minister M K Stalin had laid the foundation stone in February 2009. A senior official on the condition of anonymity attributed the lack of interest shown by the stake holders to inferior construction of the building. The leakage in the toilets led to peeling off of cement plaster posing danger of seepage of water into the walls that could eventually cause serious damage if not repaired. PWD, buildings division, Trichy which has been taking care of annual maintenance of the integrated collectorate building has been asked to attend to the problem. Out of the Rs 27.43 lakh being allotted for the annual maintenance of the collector office, PWD had around Rs 15 lakh after the expenses incurred on the maintenance of toilets, water supply and security services this year. An official refusing to be quoted pointed out the damage of tiles in the corridor and some of the places. As a part of the major repairing work, PWD found it necessary to replace 14 cubicles of the toilets in the damaged areas and whitewash the area.  The whitewash for the entire building was expected to be taken up later in the next allocation.
