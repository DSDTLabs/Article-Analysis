 For a mess-free eye make-up look, apply scotch tape on the sides of your eyes as shown.
  Then, start with a primer and use cool brown shade to add depth on the creases. Layer it with a light hue on the creases and a darker hue on the outer corners. Top it off with some shimmery hue in the centre.
 
 Next, use a highlighter or a nude base shimmer shadow on the brow bone and the inner corner of the eyes.
 
 To achieve the flawless wing eye, apply your liner from the inner corner to the outer corner. Complete the look with a coat of mascara and if you wish to curl your lashes, do it before applying the mascara.
 
 
 
 And for your face, start with a concealer—use an orange based one to combat dark circles and blemishes. Next, apply concealer and foundation in patting motion, without removing the orange concealer underneath.
 
 To highlight the eyes, try the baking technique like Chandni and use a translucent powder below your eyes. 
 
 If you don’t want to go heavy on contouring, just use a bronzer on the jawline and cheeks diagonally like shown. And later, add a pop of colour using a natural hue of blush. To highlight the cheeks, use a highlighter or a strobing cream on the cheekbones.
 
 
 
 And now for your lips, trace your natural lip line—always start from the outer corner to the centre for the upper lip for the perfect shape. Once, you’ve lined your lips, top it off with a layer of lipstick or a lip gloss.
