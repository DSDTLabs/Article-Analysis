PUNE: It is not difficult for   to become  . All it takes is for the civic authorities to take a zero-tolerance stance, says chief municipal officer of Vengurla, Ramesh  . 

 Kokare is in the city for the ongoing  , where he will receive the Vasundhara Mitra award bestowed upon activists. 
 
 Speaking at an interaction at  , Kokare said the belief that it is tougher to eliminate plastic in bigger cities when compared to smaller ones, is just a mental barrier among the people. 
 
 “This is a psychological barrier which residents of bigger cities need to overcome. All it does it to make it seem like more of a daunting task than usual,” he said. “It is wrong to think that making a big city trash-and-plastic-free is more difficult,” he added, while speaking about the challenges involved in such a task.
 
 As the chief officer of Dapoli municipality, Kokare transformed it into a plastic-free region. Later in 2015, as chief municipal officer of Vengurla, Sindhudurg, he pushed through various sustainability-based projects, resulting in it becoming an open defecation-free town in October that year.
 
 To stop open defecation and promote recycling, Kokare and his team patrolled the town every morning from 6 to 9am. “We fined anyone involved in untoward acts. We had support from the local police. There will always be opposition to any new idea, but the people there stand witness to the town’s transformation,” Kokare told TOI.
 
 As a part of his drive, Kokare said he also visited schools and tell the students to write letters, pledging to segregate their garbage, and keep their surroundings clean. “This also trickled down to the parents. We also conducted dhol-tasha announcements to make sure the message reached everyone, and it did,” he added.
 
 Kokare, along with filmmaker Subbiah Nallamuthu, water activist Ayyappa Masagi, Pune-based Central Water and Power Research Station will be bestowed honours at the closing ceremony of KVIFF on Wednesday.
