Chinese food is comfort food for most. Yet, most argue over this usually pocket-friendly cuisine because of the use of flavour enhancers, which aren’t good for health. Addressing this concerning in the legislative assembly, Bengaluru Health Minister   recently was quoted as saying, “Successive governments have failed in controlling the rampant use of flavour enhancers such as Mono-Sodium Glutamate ( ) in the preparation of Chinese dishes such as Gobi Manchurian and Fried Rice. It is taking a toll on the people’s health, we are thinking of prohibiting the usage of flavour enhancers in food.”
He further added, “I have directed my department officials to submit a report on the usage of MSG and other flavour enhancers. Following the report, we will decide on the next course of action.”
 
 
 It was in the late 90s that Gobi Manchurian, Veg Noodles and Veg Fried Rice moved from the Chinese restaurant kitchens to fast food restaurants and street stalls. Priced around `15 a plate, these became a hit for outings for students and even families when they were too lazy to cook. Food and beverage consultant   says, “Street food is intrinsic to any city’s foodscape. They not only cater to low price eating for fun but are also means to daily sustenance for many. The now popular Indo-Chinese cuisine made its foray in Bengaluru because people were fascinated to have something 'foreign' when they went out. It became easily accessible and also grew popular as it was affordable. But, to add a certain amount of X factor to their food, they used flavour enhancers like MSG. Of course, these made people flaunt it more, despite people talking against it and highlighting the health issues. Most of the Oriental restaurants have found replacements that are not as harmful. These smaller vendors also need to be made aware about the same to ensure everything is back to how it is meant to be. It is hard to keep street food out of bigger metropolitan cities like Bengaluru.”
