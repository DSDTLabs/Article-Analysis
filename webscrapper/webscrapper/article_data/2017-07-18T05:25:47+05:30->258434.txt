MUMBAI: A 30-year-old man holding a master's degree in business administration (MBA) from London was arrested from Vapi in Gujarat on Monday for allegedly cheating a 27-year-old Vile Parle resident of her diamond-studded ring worth Rs1.25 lakh by masquerading as a prospective groom. Charged with theft, he is now in custody.

 The police said that the accused,  , befriended the woman through a matrimonial site. He had put up his profile using a fake name, Aryan Patel.
 
 Apolice officer said that Panchal and the Vile Parle resident got chatting on social networking sites and WhatsApp. Last week, he asked her to meet him at a coffee shop at Carter Road in Bandra (west). There, he told the woman that he wanted to gift her a diamond ring. “He asked for the ring she was wearing to get the right size,“ said   Nandkumar Gopale.
 
 At that moment, Panchal's phone rang. The woman's complaint says that he stepped out of the coffee shop, gesturing to her that he would be back after finishing the phone conversation, but disappeared with her diamond ring, said police inspectors Dinesh Kadam.
 
 An officer from Khar police station said that some “unfortunate turn of events“ in the family forced Panchal to resort to cheating. Deputy commissioner of police   said he was tracked down using his cellphone location.
