NEW DELHI: Former finance minister   and his family members are in more trouble, with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) registering a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against   in connection with the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance given to INX Media of jailed former media magnate  .

 The case has been registered on the basis of a CBI FIR that alleges that Karticontrolled companies received at least Rs 3.5 crore from INX Media for influencing an FIPB clearance by the finance ministry, then headed by his father. Sources said the ED would probe the alleged “proceeds of crime” generated in this case and may also attach assets of the various accused.
 
 Earlier this year, the ED had claimed that it had opened a money laundering probe against the former FM in the Rs 3,500 crore Aircel-Maxis case related to the 2G spectrum scam. In yet another case involving the violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) rules, the agency has issued a showcause notice to   asking him to explain gains in Vasan Healthcare Pvt Ltd, where he first acquired shares for Rs 50 lakh and within a year sold them to an investor from Mauritius for Rs 22.50 crore, allegedly through a front entity.
 
 The agency had said its probe against Chidambaram in the Aircel-Maxis case was related to the former FM allegedly bypassing the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in giving approval to the company to bring in Rs 3,500 crore. According to the ED, Karti and a company controlled by him, Advantage Strategic Consulting Pvt Ltd, have been issued showcause notices for FEMA violations of Rs 45 crore in the Vasan Healthcare case where the agency is probing several foreign companies for their alleged transactions with companies linked to Karti.
 
 Chidambaram and Karti have denied all charges.
