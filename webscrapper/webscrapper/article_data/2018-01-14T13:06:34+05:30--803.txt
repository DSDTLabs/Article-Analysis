NEW DELHI: Delhi' s wicketkeeper-batsman  , who was sacked from state captaincy after having led the team to Ranji Trophy final only a week before, blasted an unbeaten 116 off just 38 deliveries against Himachal in a North Zone T20 League (Syed Mustaq Ali Trophy) fixture leading his team to a crushing 10-wicket victory on Sunday. 

 Chasing a target of 144 set by Himachal, Pant got to the triple-figure mark in just 32 deliveries - the second fastest in T20 history - and along with Gautam Gambhir (30 not out off 33 deliveries), chased down the target in just 11.4 overs. 
 
 Chris Gayle still holds the record for the fastest century in the format when he clubbed 100 off just 30 deliveries against Pune Warriors in an Indian Premier League match back in 2013.
 
 During his maverick innings, Pant clobbered 12 sixes and eight fours to add to his tally of four catches behind the stumps earlier in the match. 
 
 For Himachal, Nikhil Gangta top-scored with 40 while opener Prashant Chopra scored 30 off 33. Delhi skipper Pradeep Sangawan claimed two wickets while Navdeep Saini, Pawan Negi, Kulwant Khejroliya, Lalit Yadav and Subodh Bhati top one wicket each. 
 
 A day before, the former captain had made short work of a below-par Jammu & Kashmir with a 33-ball 51 helping Delhi to an eight-wicket win. 
 
 Pant had earlier broken the first-class record of the fastest century by an Indian batsman with a blink-and-you-miss 48-ball ton, his second of the match, against Jharkhand during the 2016-17 Ranji Trophy season. En route his record breaking ton, Pant eclipsed a 28-year old record set by former Tamil Nadu opener VB Chandrasekhar, who reached the three-figure mark in 56 balls against Rest of India during the Irani Cup match of the 1988-89 series. 
 
 The same season, he hammered 308 off 326 balls against Maharashtra with the help of nine sixes and 42 fours to become the youngest wicketkeeper to score a triple century in first class cricket. 
 
 During the previous edition of the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Bangladesh, Pant, the vice-captain of the team led by Ishan Kishan, slammed the fastest fifty in Under-19 World Cup history, off 18 balls in a seven-wicket win over Nepal in the group stages. The day turned out to be even sweeter for Pant as he was picked up for a whopping Rs 1.9 crore by Delhi Daredevils for the 2016 IPL season. 
 
 After a successful 2016-17 domestic season, Pant was rewarded with an international debut in the third and final T20I between India and England in Bangalore.
