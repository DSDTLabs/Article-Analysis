PANAJI: After a spate of thefts from ATMs across the state, the   have issued fresh guidelines to banks to prevent such occurances. The police have suggested that banks install night vision cameras outside ATMs and instructions printed that ask customers to cover the PIN pad when entering their number. The advisory also states that banks need to take additional measures for ATMs in relatively lonely areas. 

 “Attempts have been made by criminals to install debit/credit card cloning devices and cameras to capture PINs, etc,” the advisory states. “Several accused, including foreigners, have been arrested in this regard. Since ATMs are installed in the open and also at areas where there is hardly any footfall, they are more vulnerable to crime.” 
 
 
  
 
 The advisory asks bank officials to depute a responsible person to check the   twice a day, in the morning and evening, to check if the blinking light of the slot where the card is inserted is hidden. This shows that a skimmer has been fitted on top of the card slot. “They should also check if any spy cameras are placed, especially above the keypad of the ATM machine,” states the advisory.
 
 Banks have been told to ask the private agencies to whom the work of ATM operations is outsourced to ensure that there is no cloning device added to the card reader slot. 
 
 The advisory also states that the police should immediately be informed if any cloning devices or cameras are detected, and that the local bank manager responsible for ATM operations should be available on call 24x7 so as to respond to emergencies.
 
 “The feed of CCTV data should be preserved at least for one month,” the advisory says. “In case of any suspicious interference at an ATM, transactions should be stopped forthwith. Banks must ensure that cloning-proof ATMs are installed.”
