Jalandhar: With UK national Jagtar Singh ‘Jaggi’ Johal having spent over 100 days in jail in connection with investigations into targeted killings in Punjab, a British MP, Martin Docherty, in whose area Jaggi and his family have been living, has again asked the UK government to ensure that the rights of its citizens detained abroad are protected.

 Docherty is the MP from West Dunbartonshire, Scotland. “The longer my constituent spends in custody without charge, the more concerned we are about his physical and mental well being. Our message to @BorisJonson is clear: the UK government must do more to ensure the rights of British citizens detained abroad are protected,” Docherty tweeted on Tuesday evening. He had tweeted on Monday also to mark 100 days of Johal’s detention.
 
 The MP also joined Johal’s family when it later addressed a press conference on Monday to highlight that he Johal had been in custody of Punjab Police for 100 days, without being charged. Jaggi’s brother Gurpreet Singh, an advocate, said, “We are not able to do anything, just sit here. The UK government has not helped us to get any kind of justice.”
 
 Docherty had earlier raised the issue in UK parliament also. He has been tweeting under #FreeJaggiNow. 
 
 Gurpreet said Jaggi had not done anything wrong and if he had done anything wrong, the Indian government would have charged him by now. 
 
 The issue has been making headlines in Britain, after Punjab Police arrested Jaggi in Jalandhar on November 4.
 
 Even British Prime Minster Theresa May had said in third week of November that she was aware of Jaggi’s detention.
