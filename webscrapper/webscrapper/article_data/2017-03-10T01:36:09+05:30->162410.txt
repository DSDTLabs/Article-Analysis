Mumbai: BMC commissioner   on Thursday warned all ward officials that he would hold them responsible if roads develop   this year. The ward officials have been told that strict action and inquiry would be initiated against them if potholes spring up on roads in their wards in large numbers. 

 Last year, the civic chief had got the flak from people after craters surfaced on roads during the rains.
 
 Earlier this year, officials of all wards were asked to submit a list of roads in their wards that needed to be repaired on a priority basis. At a marathon meeting with ward-level officials on Thursday, Mehta said that as lists of roads requiring pre-monsoon repairs have been submitted by the ward officials, there should be no potholes on any other roads. 
 
 A   who attended the meeting said, “We have been asked to ensure that unlike last year, roads do not develop potholes as we have identified roads that required repairs. It has been made our responsibility if there is any pothole on roads this year.” 
 
 In September last year, a huge pothole near the state-run JJ Hospital killed a 21-year-old youth, Rizwan Khan, while he was returning home with a friend after buying ice-cream for his family. The BMC, which had long ignored the pothole, swung into action after the accident and filled it up the next morning. 
 
 At present, 538 project roads are being laid in the city while several pre-monsoon road works have also been taken up. “We are focusing more on pre-monsoon preventive road works this time. We aim to complete the works by May 15,” a road department official said.
