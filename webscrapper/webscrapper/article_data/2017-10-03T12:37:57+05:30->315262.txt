Jada Pinkett Smith's motorbike is up for grabs. 

  
  
 
 The 46-year-old actor's husband   had gifted a red and black Yamaha Vstar 650 to her in 2011. 
 
 Jada had nicknamed the vehicle 'Lil Beast', but she drove the bike fewer than 100 miles before she sold it barely two years later. 
 
 The motorcycle is now being sold by   for USD 5,000, a USD 1,000 more than its market value - based on its current low mile usage and its former famous owner. 
 
 Earlier in 2013, Jada had shared her picture with the bike, writing, "I am saying goodbye to my 'Lil Beast'. I'm only sticking to my three-wheelers from now on, but it sure has been fun. She's been good to me."
