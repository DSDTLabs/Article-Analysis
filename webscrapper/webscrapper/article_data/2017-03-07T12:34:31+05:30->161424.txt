GUWAHATI: One of  's tallest  , chief minister  , has not just set high standards as far as work culture in   is concerned, but is himself leading from the front. 

 He reaches office sharp at 9.30am.
 
 "What can government employees do but be in office if the   himself reaches at 9.30 in the morning?" a government spokesperson said on being asked about the new work culture.
 
 The 81-year old chief minister, who recently took charge of the state, spelt out his work mantra a day after being sworn in on February 22. "He means business; he also means to stick to the mantras he dictated...be punctual in office, set it in order and give the best of your service to the public," the spokesperson added.
 
 "Not many government employees at the secretariat or the directorates are known to reach office on time, nor are they known to stay till 4pm. But when the chief minister is ready by 7am and raring to go to office, a new era in governance is ushered. The timings of thousands of government employees - at least, in the secretariat - are about to be changed drastically," he added.
 
 "Government employees are paid a salary and they are required to attend to their duties for a specific period of time on all working days," he said, quoting the chief minister. Liezietsu has told his aides that if traffic congestion was the reason employees could not reach office on time, they should leave home early.
 
 The chief minister has also instructed his security officials to make sure that his movements through the city did not inconvenience any member of the public.
 
 "I am a public servant and I have no right to inconvenience the people I serve while moving through the city," he has told his officer on special duty (security). Liezietsu insists that his convoy wait it out in traffic jams like any other motorist caught in the morning rush.
