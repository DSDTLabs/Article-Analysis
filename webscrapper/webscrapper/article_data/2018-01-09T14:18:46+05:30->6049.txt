MUNGER: Chief minister   will be here on Tuesday to review the progress of schemes under his seven resolves programmes besides many other   and the state launched earlier in the six districts of   division. 

 The review meeting will be held in the renovated conference room of the Munger museum which has been developed as an attractive auditorium. The park of the museum has also been decked up with multicoloured flower plants and fountains. 
 
 The district magistrates of Begusarai, Khagaria, Jamui, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura and Munger besides the top officials of different departments will participate in the review meeting in the presence of the divisional commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pal, who took charge only a week back.
 
 Sources said the CM is likely to focus on the disposal of cases under Right to Public Grievances Act, which is the CM’s brainchild. “A few aggrieved persons had complained to the CM through letters that the grievance redressal forum found no public authority guilty for the delay in disposing of applications. The CM is likely to take up the matter during the review meeting,” a source said. 
 
 Munger district public relations officer Dinesh Kumar said there was no public meeting of the CM. “He will return to Patna after the review meeting,” Kumar said.
