HYDERABAD: Amid conflicting contentions about the amendment of the by-laws to make the   acceptable to the Lodha Committee, the Hyderabad High Court posted the PIL on HCA to Monday for further hearing. The bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Shameem Akther on Thursday elicited the opinions on appointing either an administrator or an observer to oversee the affairs of the HCA in view of the intense infighting being witnessed on who should represent the HCA in the ensuing IPL season.

 The bench inconclusively heard the arguments in the PIL filed by Govind Reddy. The bench wanted all the parties to the case to address on the petition made by the BCCI requesting the court to appoint an administrator or observer to facilitate smooth functioning of the forthcoming IPL matches. HCA incharge president suggested to the court that it is acceptable to them if the court appoints former   judges like Justices B P  , P   and M Jagannadha Rao as observers. The bench too said they are great legal authorities but expressed a doubt whether they will convey their consent to do this job.
 
 When the counsel for HCA secretary sought to make light the allegations on HCA's excessive spending on food in the recent Indo-Bangladesh match, the bench told him that spending Rs 75 lakhs on food alone cannot be taken so lightly that too when the whole money was shown as spent on food in just four days. The counsel for the HCA's adhoc committee urged the court to declare them as an authorised signatory to deal with BCCI and Franchise for the ensuing IPL matches.
