AHMEDABAD: Union Minister of State for Social Justice   on Sunday batted for   alleging that the neighbouring country is habouring terrorism on its soil and instilling unrest in Kashmir.

 Speaking before reporters in the city about achievement of Prime Minister   led NDA government, Athawale admitted that   were about to go for a war recently but it could be avoided. However, there is an urgent need to call a war against Pakistan, he said.
 
 “There was 99.99% possibility of war between India and China recently. China was taking us lightly believing that we are still the India of 1962 but they soon realized that we are the India of 2017. When they realized that, then the war could be avoided. But war with Pakistan cannot be avoided. There is an urgent need to call a war against Pakistan,” Athawale said.
 
 Athawale said that Japan and India recently issued a joint statement condemning terrorism being flourished on the soil of Pakistan. Even America has also toughened its stance on Pakistan considering its activities, he said.
 
 “Pakistan should keep good relations with India by indulging into business treaties to improve its economy rather than violating ceasefire and harbouring terrorists in Kashmir. I believe the time has come when Pakistan must be taught a lesson,” Athawale said.
 
 Athawale also hailed the decision of making Nirmala Sitharam country’s first woman defence minister and said, “Nirmala   has been made the new defence minister to teach Pakistan a strong lesson. Only a woman can teach a good lesson to Pakistan.”
