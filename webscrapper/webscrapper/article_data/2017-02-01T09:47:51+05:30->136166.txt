VISAKHAPATNAM: Indian Coast Guard’s (ICG) long-pending plan to set up an air enclave in the port city is likely to become a reality by the end of 2018 as issues pertaining to land close to INS Dega were sorted out recently. 

 The plan was mooted by the central government six years ago, but several hurdles pushed the proposal into the back burner. Now, 10 acre of land from the   (VPT) close to INS Dega would be given to them. The air enclave will have an air squadron of four maritime surveillance aircraft like Dornier aircraft or bigger. According to sources, ICG has already obtained the necessary permission to set up the air station and construction works are likely to begin from June this year. 
 
 Presently,   District-6 (Andhra Pradesh) does not have any aircraft, except an ALH chopper. According to sources, in emergency situations, ICG is forced to depend on either Chennai or   stations for Dornier aircraft. 
 
 “The air squadron will be able to help in checking intrusions into Indian waters and along the AP coast. If the aircraft spots any suspicious movement near the coastline, the coastal security police will swing into action based on inputs given by the aircraft. They will also help in preventing smuggling,” a senior ICG officer told TOI. 
 
 Coast Guard DIG at Vizag   said a no objection certificate has already been given to them for setting up the air enclave.
