NOIDA: An   has been lodged against the owner of Grand   after an inquiry conducted by Meerut divisional commissioner revealed the land on which the mall was built had been categorised for a park and not commercial use.

 A Greater Noida-based advocate, Brij Mohan Sharma, who is also one of the investors in the mall, has filed a complaint against the owner, Monty Bhasin, alleging that the group had persuaded government officials to change the category of the land from “park use” to “commercial use”. The FIR was lodged three days ago.
 
 A spokesperson for the mall denied the allegations.
 
 Kasna SHO Brijesh Verma said Sharma had attached a copy of the report of the inquiry conducted by the commissioner. “He had complained to the commissioner around six months ago. The inquiry report states that in 2007, the mall management got the land category changed from park to commercial in connivance with government officials. We have lodged an FIR against the owner of the group,” he said.
 
 The FIR has been lodged under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record).
 
 Sources said the commissioner had written to the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation (UPSIDC) to cancel the land allotment of the mall. Arunvir Singh, the CEO of YEIDA, said the land belonged to UPSIDC.
 
 A spokesperson for the mall claimed the land on which the mall was built was for commercial use. “The complainant is resorting to arm-twisting tactics. A case was lodged because there was a written complaint,” the spokesperson said.
