NAGPUR: Sarathi, a social organization, has demanded strict laws for citizenship and implementing   properly. The organization raised the issue in the backdrop of alleged bogus voting in recently held elections. 

 Addressing a press conference in the city on Friday, Amar Vazalwar, Sarathi founder, said that in our country anyone without valid credentials can get  , become   and can apply for passport and voter’s card. 
 
 Aniruddha Vazalwar, co-founder of Sarathi, said, “The common man is not aware of norms for citizenship. We request the government to frame proper rules.” 
 
 Vazalwar appealed that everybody must enrol the names of their new born for citizenship and get certificate affixed with a photo. Government must also ask individuals about their background for 15 years and also seek details of parents. 
 
 “Also, documents like Aadhaar card and driving licences, facilities like water and electricity supply must be given only after a valid certificate of citizenship is produced,” Vazalwar said.
