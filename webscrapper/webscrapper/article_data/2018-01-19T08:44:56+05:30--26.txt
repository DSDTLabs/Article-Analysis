CHENNAI: Refusing to grant any relief to over 200 families of   in  , who had allegedly encroached a tank poramboke, for nearly 50-years, the Madras high court has directed the authorities to remove the encroachments within 30 days.

 A division bench of Justices M   and Justice S   passed the order while dismissing a batch of plea moved by the residents seeking direction to forebear the authorities from evicting them from Kayidhe Millath Nagar, in Anankaputhur.
 
 According to the petitioners, the properties they reside are shown as stony grounds in the revenue records and on the said land, nearly 200 family members have been residing for more than 50 years.
 
 They periodically made representations before the revenue authorities seeking patta to the said land and the same are pending. 
 
 However, the respondent issued a notice dated November 2, 2016 under the   Protection of Tanks and Eviction of Encroachment Rules, 2007, to some of the residents asking them to clear the encroachments.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing, the bench said, "By getting an order from this court, the petitioners are trying to continue to stay in the tank bund. This court will not be a party to such illegality. During 2015, several persons were affected on account of floods and many persons were removed by the government from water bodies, as their life need to be safeguarded.
 
 Hence the authorities are directed to remove the encroachment within 30 days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order."
