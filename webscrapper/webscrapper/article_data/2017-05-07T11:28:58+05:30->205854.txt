It’s been a gruelling few months for   – hopping from sets to sets. The actor, who recently received the National Award from the President of India in Delhi, has now headed to   to enjoy some quality time with his family.

 We hear that the superstar will now be back next week and would immediately join the sets of Lal Jose’s movie in Trivandrum. The film will have an extensive schedule at the city with shooting mostly at St Xavier’s College in Thumba. 
 
 Mohanlal would then join the schedule of VA Shrikumar’s Odiyan, which also has Manju Warrier and Prakash Raj, in the lead. Most of the film’s shooting will be in Palakkad.
