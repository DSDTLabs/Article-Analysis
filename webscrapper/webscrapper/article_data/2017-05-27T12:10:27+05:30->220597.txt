  : A complaint filed on Friday by one Sangeeta Bhosle before the Mormugao mamlatdar, claimed that a former deputy sarpanch of Chicalim panchayat, Kamla Prasad Yadav, and his wife,  , hold two EPICs each; one registered in   and the other in Goa. 

 Both, Kamla and Savita, have filed their nominations for the upcoming elections to the Chicalim local body from ward Nos. 4 and 6 respectively. Similarly, one Arjun Naik complained that a former Chicalim sarpanch Neelam Naik, had filed her nomination from ward No. 7, reserved for   candidates, although she belonged to the creamy level. Mamlatdar Satish Prabhu said decisions on the three nominations would be taken on Saturday.
