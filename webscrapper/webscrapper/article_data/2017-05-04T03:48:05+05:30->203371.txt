GURUGRAM: Residents of   are likely to get reprieve from frequent power cuts. Power discom DHBVN has installed a 1.45-km-long   in Sector 43   to aid the overloaded power system in the area.

 Discom officials told TOI that A, B C and D blocks of   Phase-1 are prone to power disruptions. The new feeder, according to officials, is going to directly benefit around 10,000 consumers across the area.
 
 “There was the problem of overloading. The load running on the existing feeder that supplies power to the area is around 370 ampere. Ideally one feeder should only carry a load of 300 ampere,” said Kuldeep Nehra, sub-divisional officer, DLF City.
 
 “We have named this new feeder Vyapar Kendra feeder. Already we have an 11 kv line that emanated from 220 kV substation in Sector 52. This is the line that supplies power to this area. But it’s overloaded. To give it relief, we have added the new 11 kV feeder emanating from 66kV substation in Sector 43,” he added.
 
 Nehra said due to the problem of overloading, the area witnessed frequent outages. 
 
 “The discom has already installed over 19 transformers during winters to strengthen the system and is now augmenting the 66 kV Sikanderpur substation in Q Block of DLF so that the infrastructure supports the increase in demand,” he said.
 
 According to sources in HVPN, the currently supply across Gurgaon stands at 191 lakh units per day.
