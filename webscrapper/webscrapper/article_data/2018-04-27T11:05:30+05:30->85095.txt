BENGALURU: Surveillance cameras are not much of a deterrent to   as a businessman found out much to chagrin. Thieves outsmarted the businessman by disconnecting a camera and took away the digital video recorder (DVR) that stored footage shot by   installed in his Jayanagar IV ‘T’ Block home. They walked away with more than Rs 1 lakh in cash besides silver ornaments and the DVR.

 Sikandar, a fruit merchant, told police the burglary occurred sometime between April 15 and April 22 when he and his family were away on a tour to   and Kashmir. He had installed four CCTV cameras outside his house. The cameras covered the front and back doors besides passages on the side. He has also linked the DVR to his mobile phone so that he could watch footage regularly, police said.
 
 “Sikadnar and his family left for Jammu and Kashmir on April 15,” police said. “Every day he would scan footage of his house on his phone. All seemed okay till the morning of April 20,” police said. Police say on the night of April 20, Sikandar had no access to footage on his mobile.
 
 “He put it down to a technical issue and didn’t think much about it,” police said. “But he kept trying — unsuccessfully — to restore the link between the DVR and his phone. When he and his family returned home on April 22, they found the camera that covered the back door had been disconnected. His worst fears came true when he found his house had been burgled.”
 
 Police said the thieves had removed the hinges of the door and entered the kitchen. From there, they accessed other parts of the house. “The DVR was kept in the hall. Aware that it would contain footage of their entry, the miscreants took it away,” police said.
