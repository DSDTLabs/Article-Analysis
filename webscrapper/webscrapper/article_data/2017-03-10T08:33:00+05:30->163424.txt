MUMBAI: A   was found hiding in the   assembly of a   on Wednesday night. Unlike the other passengers on board the aircraft, this particular passenger had no travel documents, which was probably why it flew away soon after it was detected.

 “The native owl flew into the landing gear while UA49 BOM-EWR (Mumbai-Newark) was parked at the gate. It was safely removed by our maintenance team and the aircraft departed four minutes early,” said a spokesperson of United Airlines.
 
 Based on the photograph, a wildlife expert identified the intruder as a barn owl. Barn owls are the most widely distributed species of owl and are found in Eurasia, Africa, America and Australia. 
 
 Early in the day, there were speculations that the bird had flown into India as a stowaway onboard the aircraft. But unlike passenger cabin, in the landing gear compartment, temperature, pressure and oxygen levels are not maintained at comfortable levels, so it is almost impossible to survive such a long journey.
