In general insurance, motor and health continued to be the biggest contributors to sector growth.  Of total gross direct premium generated for 2016-17 of Rs 1.28 lakh crore, motor contributed Rs 50,250.53 crore (40%) and health contributed Rs 34,526 crore (27%). Premium from other segments contributed 24% (Rs 30,895.72 crore) primarily because of the growth of crop insurance. “According to a Mckinsey study India spends 4% of its GDP on health care. Of this roughly 9% is financed by insurance arrangement, 30% is financed by public expense (Government and NGO’s) and rest 61% is self financed. This level of self financing is bound to have negative consequence,” said Pankaj Nawani, VP, Max Life Insurance Co. “Last decade and a half has seen very rapid expansion of health insurance coverage in India. In 2003-04 the total premium for health insurance in India was Rs 1,370 cr ore which has risen in FY 2016 to Rs 21,000 crore. This is a CAGR of nearly 30%, making health insurance the fastest growing segment in the Indian Insurance sector.”
