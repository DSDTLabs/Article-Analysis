 Citing poor mobile network in the region, Shekhawat has drawn the attention of the Central government to the issue.

 “The population in the desert region was so scattered leading to very low population density and the parameters of the BSNL for installation of mobile towers appeared quite impractical in this region,” Shekhawat said.
 
 He said that the the Prime Minister has given relaxation in this condition in the Eastern states for the same reason by bringing it down to 2,000 connections for one mobile tower.
 
 He said that mobile network is a big issue in desert region and in present era, mobile network was not just a means of communication but has emerged as a major tool for achieving goals like Digital India, Cashless India and likes.
 
 “And if the there was no adequate and quality mobile network in the remote areas of the country, realization of these goals will be faced with stumbling blocks,” he said.
 
 Referring to these issues, Shekhawat has demanded relaxation of the mobile tower to mobile connection ratio in Western Rajasthan, so that the people of this region could avail the benefits of consistent network.
