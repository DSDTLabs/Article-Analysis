DHARAMSHALA: In a major jolt to   (CTA), another major   which was planned in Delhi in April has been deferred. Tibetan parliament deputy speaker   confirmed the development but refused to give any details.

 It is a second major Delhi slated Tibetan event to have been called off. Earlier, Thank You India event to mark 60 years of the exile of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama was scrapped following the Union goverment’s directions to senior dignitaries to stay away from it.
 
 Now, ‘Global conference on Tibet’, which was to be held from April 26 to 28 in New Delhi, has been deferred. “The event has been postponed. It was to be hosted by the CTA in Delhi and parliamentarians from 30 countries were to participate it,” said Kangra MP Shanta Kumar, who was also to attend it.
 
 Repeated attempts to contact the Tibetan administration remained futile but well placed sources said no further dates have been announced for the event.
 
 He averted querries on reasons for the change of plan. Tibetan parliamentarian   denied any knowledge about the development this. Another Tibetan MP Lobsang didn’t respond to calls on the phone.
