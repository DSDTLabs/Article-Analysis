Chennai: Giving   to those who had participated in the anti-Hindi agitation would amount to encouraging agitations against a particular language, said the  , adding, “If the trend is allowed to continue, integrity of the country would be at stake.”

 Justice R Suresh Kumar dismissed a plea of S Chokalingam seeking pension on the ground that he had been jailed thrice for taking part in agitations in Tirupur and Avinashi.
 
 In 1983, the government brought in the TN Payment of Pension to Tamil Scholars Miscellaneous Provision Act to grant pension to persons who participated in the agitation to safeguard the interest and richness of Tamil language.
 
 The judge said since the government stopped giving benefit to those who participated in the agitation no order could be passed against this policy decision of the government.
