AHMEDABAD: A former Ranji Trophy player from Porbandar on Friday filed a PIL in Gujarat high court, seeking implementation of the   recommendations in the   ( ) to free it from the “super control” of former secretary Niranjan Shah.

 The petitioner, Rajesh Jadeja, urged the HC to direct the   ( ) to implement the recommendations in their entirety, by asking the SCA to give voting rights to all former first class cricketers as life members from the day they became members of SCA. He has also demanded equal voting rights for all 16 district cricket associations for equal representation. He has also demanded appointment of an independent administrator to manage SCA affairs and hold elections in the association.
 
 The petitioner alleged that Shah, his family and friends have controlled the SCA administration for the last four decades, and funds received from BCCI are transferred to the Saurashtra Cricket Trust. These funds are meant for all districts of Saurashtra and Kutch, but the money is mostly restricted to Rajkot.
 
 Complaining of nepotism, the petition gives the example of Shah’s son Jaydev, who has been captaining the team for the last 10 years and is the trustee, member of governing body and in-charge of the SCA cricket stadium at the same time. The petitioner also alleged that Jaydev’s performance has been very poor, but he continues as a player and captain of the team. Complaining that Shah’s control over SCA vitally affects the game of cricket in all of Saurashtra, the petitioner demanded complete execution of the Lodha commission’s suggestions as directed by the SC, which would automatically render most of the office bearers disqualified.
