When it comes to Met Gala, one of the biggest red-carpet events of the year, the party doesnâ€™t stop there. The fashionistas give us more dose of fashion as they play dress up again for the after-party. From alluring gowns to party dresses, this day's outfit swapping always gets our attention. 

 
 
 
 And when it came to our homegirl,  , she gave a whole new twist to her 
 . Her 10-foot dramatic train for Met Gala, needed a lot of help to get her up to the stairs, out from the car and she still managed to pull it off with elan. 
 
 For the after-party, Priyanka was spotted in the same Ralph Lauren trench coat with the popped collar, rolled up sleeves but without the extra-extra-long train. And surprisingly it was the same coat which was not altered at all! The custom-made coat dress was actually made like a short dress with a detachable long train. Well, this genius style is clearly one of the best red carpet 
  after-party outfits!
