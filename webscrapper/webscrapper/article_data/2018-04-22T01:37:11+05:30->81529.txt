NEW DELHI: Days after a   lost   worth approximately  , its  , Amitabh Saxena, has joined the  . Cops said Saxena was asked to come in for questioning when he was planning to leave for Australia from Mumbai.

 A team led by additional DCP (Cyber Cell) K P S Malhotra has initiated the technical investigation into Coinsecure’s complaint that the firm had lost 438 bitcoins from its wallets.
 
 Investigating officers said that apart from tracing the lost bitcoins through its blockchains — which gives a trail where the lost currency is being transferred to — cops are also going through the communications the company had with its clients after receiving individual complaints from them. 
 
 One of the complainants had said he had been investing with the company for the past 18 months. A day before the company reported the theft to its users, the businessman said, he had found that the company’s website had become inoperative.
 
 “I wanted to get some money withdrawn by selling some bitcoins but the website stated that they are updating. After sometime, I got suspicious and contacted the customer care where I was informed about the theft. I lost approximately 9 bitcoins worth Rs 40 lakh.” 
 
 Another customer, Delhi-based lawyer Prakhar Deep, said he had filed a criminal complaint against the company. “It has cheated its users by intentionally shutting the website,” Deep said. He got suspicious as the website shut its operations just days after   issued a circular prohibiting banks to deal with cryptocurrency exchanges.
 
 A similar doubt was raised by another customer, Diwakar from Andhra Pradesh, who had kept Rs 6 lakh. “I had started investing in August 2017. Now I have been told to wait for three-four days more as they are creating a new website to transfer the money kept in INR.” 
 
 The company’s founder and CEO, Mohit Kalra, told TOI that if the money could not be fully recovered, the firm is working on a mechanism to pay its customers.
