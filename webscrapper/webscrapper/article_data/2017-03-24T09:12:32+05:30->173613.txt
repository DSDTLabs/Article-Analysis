THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As the Supreme Court has issued an ultimatum for construction of   to check the flow of waste water into   pond, the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) is set start its work on Friday. As per the ruling, the deadline for the same falls on May 15.

 A 272-metre-long sewage line would be constructed on the northern side of the temple pond. The household waste from the neighbourhood has been contaminating the water body for quite long.
 
 Sources said that some of the houses in the areas lacked proper sewage connectivity and it was directly disposed of into drains. The sewerage system is also found to be in a dilapidated condition.
 
 Now, KWA has awarded the work worth Rs 27 lakh to construct the sewage line. The SC has asked the water authority not to outsource work in order to avoid delay in issuing and awarding tender. The work was awarded through a negotiated tender so as to avoid the delay, KWA officials said.
 
 KWA has requested the works department for permission to cut tar for laying the sewer lines. The KWA has completed the preliminary works such as digging of trail pits on Thursday.
 
 Though the Supreme Court has entrusted KWA with the task of cleansing Padmatheertham, it is worth noticing that the water authority itself has contributed to the plight of the pond.
 
 According to retired KWA official Pankajaksha Kurup, the release of sewage from pumping station at Pippinmoodu to Killi river was one of the reasons that led to the contamination of the pond more than a decade ago.
 
 The connection between Padmatheertham and Killi river dates back to Malayalam year 949. “A weir was constructed across Killi rat Maruthamkuzhi during the reign of Sri Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma, to bring water from the river to Padmatheertham using a canal named ‘Kochar’. The canal was closed after it was found that polluted water was reaching the pond around, 10 years ago,” he explained.
