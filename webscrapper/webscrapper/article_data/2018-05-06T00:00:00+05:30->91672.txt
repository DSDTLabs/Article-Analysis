Fact: Everyone  . So, everyone gets those dark, yellow patches. Agreed that there’s nothing more embarrassing than flaunting a yellow-stain on your shirt, but there’s a way to avoid them. Here are tricks you need...

 
 
 A lot of us wear vests. But a lot of us don’t, because they’re not cool anymore. But undershirts soak up the sweat, as it trickles down, saving your top layer of all the sweat. Likewise, underarm pads —available at a good local pharmacy — will help you avoid staining your shirt from the pit sweat.
 
 
 
 Fabrics like cotton, linen, voile etc. are your best bets. Any other synthetic fabrics are your enemies – shun them. 
 
 
 
 You don’t need an expensive one. But use it daily – especially after your morning shower. Dry your armpit skin before applying, spraying on wet surfaces will do no good. Pick a water-based deodorant, it’s better for your skin. 
 
 
 
 Athletic wear prevents excessive sweating or ensures quick absorption. Go to a sports goods store and invest in performance wear.
 
 
 
 Wash your clothes frequently, and add a quarter cup of bleach to the washing. But bleach is only for plain white fabrics; or it will make the   run. If you don’t want to use the chemical, go for natural supplements like lemons and white vinegar. Drying clothes in the sun removes stains. 
 
 
 
 Darker shades will have less visible stains, unlike greys, blues and bright hues. While venturing out, pick colours that won’t show or embrace sweat stains.
 
 Vests soak up sweat, saving your top layer.
