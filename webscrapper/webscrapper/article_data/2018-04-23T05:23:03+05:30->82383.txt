NEW DELHI: Around 5,400 people died in only 8,800 road accidents in   while 4,300 people were killed in 6,000 accidents in Punjab last year. Compare this with   or   where the ratio of accidents to fatalities was wide unlike the first two states.

 
 This huge difference in the ratio of accidents to fatalities has exposed how state police might be registering only those cases where someone is killed or left with major injury, and not every accident reported to them. Capturing the actual data is going to be a major area of thrust during the National Road Safety Week, which will kick off on Monday.
 
 The issue came up at two recent recent meetings of state transport secretaries and ministers. “The group of transport ministers (GoM) which met last week was informed how official data could be misleading and there is a need to work on this issue,” an official said.
 
 Traffic and transport experts have been highlighting how official data on road accidents do not capture the real picture and making policies or strategies based on flawed data could hardly bring any improvement.
 
 The data for 2017 shows Delhi recorded only 6,637 accidents despite the national capital having the highest number of vehicles. “The data provided by most states is rubbish. How can one accept that states like Bihar, UP or Delhi have such few accidents? Police simply don’t report them. Unless we bring reform and there is proper recording of accidents and their causes, the entire exercise is futile,” said  , former transport commissioner of Kerala.
 
 Kerala and Madhya Pradesh are the only states where a police officer is appointed as transport commissioner.
 
 Road safety expert   said faulty accident data has not helped in coming out with solutions. “We have to make the data collection system robust with proper investigation of accidents to zero down on the causes to find solutions,” he added. Over one-tenth of road deaths in the world happen in India.
