CHENNAI; Twenty-five-year-old K Prithika Yashini, India’s first   sub-inspector of police, on Friday became one of the 1,028 trainees of the rank to complete the year-long course at  .

 The newly-minted officers took part in a ceremonial   at a function held at the academy in Oonamanchery, Vandalur.
 
 Tamil Nadu chief minister  , who distributed certificates to the sub-inspectors, urged the state   to to be proactive and people-friendly, but to act tough with anti-social elements. He asked them keep updating their computer and internet skills to combat white collar crimes.
 
 Palaniswami said the policemen should develop both physical and mental strength to be able to counter crime.
 
 Listing out the welfare measures for police personnel that former chief minister J Jayalalithaa introduced, the chief minister advised the young police officers to maintain good health, both physical and mental, to effectively tackle difficult situations.
 
 Palaniswami said policemen should not be prejudiced in the execution of their duties because only then would members of the public feel free to approach them.
 
 “Policemen should realise that law is not a weapon, but an effective tool for the safety of people,” the chief minister said.
 
 Prithika Yashini — who endured several trials to become the country’s first police officer from the transgender community — later told reporters that she very happy to complete her training.
 
 “Both men and women training to be sub-inspectors were very cooperative, helpful and friendly with me,” she said.
 
 Yashini fought a long legal battle to write the   Uniformed Services Recruitment Board examination and the Madras high court ruled her eligible to be selected as a sub-inspector of police.
