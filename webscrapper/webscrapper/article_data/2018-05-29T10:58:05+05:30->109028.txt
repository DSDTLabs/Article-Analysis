 is the indisputable evergreen star of Bollywood. However, did you know that this beauty has a star named after her? Apparently, Madhuri has a celestial body named after her in the   constellation. The actress, in an interview, revealed that a group of her fans made an effort to get a celestial body named after her. 

 
 
 They apparently approached the   Network, a charitable organisation that provides people with an opportunity to buy a star in the sky and gift it to anyone they want. Madhuri's fans gifted this particular star to her. Interesting much? 
 
 The certificate from the Star Foundation reads: “A celestial body in the sky above has been named in honour of Madhuri Dixit-Nene and is officially located in the constellation Orion.”
