GURUGRAM: A 40-year-old   and mute man suffered serious injuries in his arms and legs after a   attacked him in Kendriya Vihar on Saturday. 

 Ashish Bhartia, a resident of Block C, was rescued by neighbours after they found him lying on the blood-strewn landing being mauled by a dog. His family has lodged a complaint with Sector 56 police station, MCG and Kendriya Vihar RWA.
 
 Madhu Bhartia, Ashish’s mother, said, “My son went out for a walk around 8.30pm. A black dog attacked him near Block C. He tried to run away and call for help, but couldn’t. Neighbours spotted him and managed to free him.”
 
 “It must have been a horrific experience for my son, as he was unable to shout for help while the dog repeatedly bit him. He suffered grievous injuries in his arms and had to receive several stitches. The dog has attacked several children in the society, but the RWA has taken no action in the matter,” she said. 
 
 On Sunday morning, after residents approached the municipal corporation, a dog-catching squad arrived at the society and took the dog away.
 
 In a statement, Kendriya Vihar RWA said it informed police and MCG through the municipal councillor after it was informed of the incident. The dog is being kept under observation.
 
 The city witnesses approximately 17-20 cases of stray dog bites every day. “We have hired an agency, Friendicoes, which has been undertaking sterilisation drives across the city. However, in most cases, people want the dogs to be relocated instead of being sterilised, which is not permissible under law,” said Y S Gupta, additional municipal commissioner, Gurugram.
 
  According to a response to an RTI query by city based activist Aseem Takyar, 7,113 dog   cases were reported last year.
