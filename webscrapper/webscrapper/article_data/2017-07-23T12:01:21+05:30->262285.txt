Recently,   fans were taken aback when reports about the megastar getting arrested in Kochi airport started circulating on social media.

 However, sources close to the actor has now clarified that Mammootty was not even in Kerala meanwhile. One of the sources posted a few photographs of the actor, who is currently in Singapore, and said, "He has been in Singapore for a week now. Then how would he be caught in Kochi? When you make fake news, please be vigilant about the timing too," he said in jest.
 
 Mammootty is seen posing with a crowd and even alone in the photographs, which shows that he was having a great time in Singapore for sure.
