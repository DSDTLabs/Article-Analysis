KANPUR: In a boost to the state's tiger population, tigress   gave birth to at least two cubs in   on Friday afternoon. The cubs are Trusha's fourth litter in a span of six years. 

 The royal Bengal tigress and the newly-born cubs have been segregated and kept in an enclosure. For next three days, no one except veterinarians would be allowed to go close to the tigress and her cubs. 
 
 Kanpur zoo director, Deepak Kumar said, "Tigress Trusha is in a good condition and is taking care of her cubs. This time too Trusha mated with Prashant, who has been brought from Farukhabad in 2011. The birth of these tiger cubs is always special keeping in mind their dwindling tiger numbers in recent years. We have remained successful in captive breeding of the   especially those who are schedule-I animals and are endangered." Trusha was brought to Kanpur zoo from Junagarh zoo in 2011. This is the second time Trusha has mated with Prashant as the latter had fathered three cubs with the tigress, earlier in 2014. All the three cubs survived and two of them are still in Kanpur zoo. 
 
 Kanpur zoo vet Dr RK Singh said Trusha will be given chicken meat and the cubs will feed on their mother's milk. He also mentioned that Trusha will continue to get vitamins, tonics and other supplements to keep her active, fit and strong as this will help her in raising cubs.
