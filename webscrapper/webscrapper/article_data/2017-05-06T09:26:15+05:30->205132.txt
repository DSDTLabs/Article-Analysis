CHENNAI: With merely two more days to go for the highly contentious   (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test), the city saw the coming together of activists, politicians, lawyers, film personalities and parents alike at   on Friday for what could be one final protest before the national   on Sunday.

 Staged by the Federation for Protection of Education Rights on Friday, the NEET protest saw a slew of speakers, including the General Secretary of Common School Platform for Schools, Prince Gajendra Babu, Justice D Hariparanthaman and R S Bharathi, party member of DMK, who spoke against the exam from the state's perspective.
 
 Maintaining that the curriculum designed by the state government remains a cause of concern for those giving NEET, Hariparanthaman stated that students who apply for NEET exams are forced to invest huge amount of money in tuitions and coaching to be trained for the CBSE-styled NEET exam. “Having classes for 17 to 18 hours a day eventually leads these students to deal with psychological depression,“ he said, adding that the center should take immediate steps in this regard, before Sunday .
 
 “Around 98% of students who apply for MBBS are from state government schools and only 2% are from CBSE education system, so this NEET entrance exam system will affect the majority,“ remarked CS Rex Sargunam, President,   Health Development Association (TNHDA).
 
 Representatives from Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) and Students Federation of India (SFI) also participated.
