BENGALURU: With the   failing to pay the electricity bills of thousands of  , most students studying in these institutions are being denied computer science education and even basic facilities like fans. Apparently, there is no provision in the school budget for electricity bill payment. 

 Chairperson of Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child’s Rights (KSCPCR), Kripa Amar Alva, wrote to energy minister D K Shivakumar on Monday, seeking his intervention in the matter. “Over 90 per cent of the schools have electricity connections but they have no provision to pay bills,” the chairperson said in the letter, a copy of which is with TOI.
 
 The commission has taken up a ‘government school enhancement program’ with an objective of providing basic facilities to school students and improving the attendance rate. “During my visits to government schools in 28 districts, I have interacted with senior officials in the education department. I have noticed that most of the schools don’t have computer systems and fans due to the department’s failure to pay the bills. The department has to make provision for the payment of government school electricity bills in its budget,” Alva said. The commission is trying to ensure government schools get computers and fans with the help of philanthropists.
 
 “It’s not a problem in one or two schools, but all government schools in Karnataka. The schools should be provided electricity supply at a subsidized rate,” said Alva, who wasn’t aware of the total outstanding bill amount.
 
 Commissioner for public instruction C Sowjanya denied Alva’s allegations. “There is a provision for schools to pay electricity bills through the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan,” Sowjanya said.
