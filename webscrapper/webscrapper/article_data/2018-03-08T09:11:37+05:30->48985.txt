BENGALURU: In the early hours of the day, one can spot pourakarmikas struggling to gather fallen leaves strewn all over roads and footpaths. The rhythm is the same every time: sweep, stoop, gather, repeat. 

 While some of this waste finds its way to landfills, most of it is left behind and burnt near the roads. This has been deterring a lot of citizens from venturing out in the morning to catch some fresh air. The problem was worsening in  , which has been ranked 121 on the air quality index report released by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board( ) recently.
 
 However, the unveiling of a Leaf and   in the BBMP park near Domlur signal on Wednesday is all set to be a game-changer for the residents and professionals of the area. 
 
 The project was undertaken by the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) committee of city-based   in association with   (BPAC).
 
 The Leaf and Garden Waste Processing Centre can compost 1.2 tonnes of garden waste in 24 to 48 hours, which can be stored till it becomes manure. The whole process takes just about 15 days. This effectively means that the pourakarmikas in the area need not burn the garden waste/leaves and instead can deliver the same to the centre for processing.
 
 Revathy Ashok, managing trustee and CEO, BPAC, pointed out: "It is also important that such initiatives are sustained over a long time". 
 
 Rajiv C Mody, chairman, MD & CEO,  , said, "We embarked upon this initiative in a short time to better the living conditions of people in the locality and are committed to support this project."
