GURUGRAM: Long   and chaos at Kherki Daula  , in the two days since NHAI revised toll rates, attest to that fact that lack of change — particularly for Rs 5 — is a major headache.

 Commuters are complaining they have to queue up for longer than before, as Rs 5 change is hard to find. Delhi resident Krishan Yadav said, “I often cross this toll plaza, as I work in Manesar. Since yesterday, length of queues have gone up drastically. During peak hours in the morning, you could spend more than an hour in one.” 
 
 Yadav spoke of the unavailability of Rs 5 coins becoming a headache for all. “We don’t carry change in our pocket. Toll operators also don’t have Rs 5 change, so they make us wait,” he added. There are commuters who said they have started to forego the change. 
 
 Toll operator   said these are initial hiccups, and everything will be normal in a few days. Toll plaza manager Satish Chander said, “We knew we would face this problem, so we are giving extra change to all booths. Queues are long, but there’s no dearth of change.”
 
 The worst affected are   drivers, said Rakesh Sharma from Manesar. “I cross the toll regularly. Paying Rs 5 extra is asking too much from a truck driver. The queue at the toll has become longer since the toll fees were raised on Sunday,” he said.
 
 NHAI has planned a toll plaza with 40 lanes at Sehrawan, but land acquisition at this new location is stuck because of non-availability of forest clearance. Some commuters said the government is not serious about relocating the toll plaza. Ashish Vashisht, resident of Ananda, DLF Phase 2, said, “Why should we pay Rs 5 extra? Is the government unwilling to shift the toll?” 
 
 The latest rate revision was implemented from April 1.
