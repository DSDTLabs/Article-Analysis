Panaji: The state election commission machinery has given candidates for the June 11 panchayat   one week to file their nomination, from May 18 to May 25, barring May 21, which is a Sunday. 

 State election commissioner R K Srivastava told TOI that the model code of conduct will also come into effect with the start of the nomination process. 
 
 “As per the official notification, the code of conduct would also come into effect from that day, which will stay in place till June 13, which is the counting day. The spending limit on candidates this time has been raised from the earlier Rs 25,000 to Rs 40,000,” Srivastava said. 
 
 The upcoming panchayat   will see 186 panchayats going to polls. 
 
 Just like the state assembly polls, the state government will be barred from making new announcements for projects or recruitments while the code of conduct is in place. The rule will be strictly followed for areas coming under the panchayats. 
 
 The government can add new names in state-run schemes only if the people are living in municipal areas. The corporation, however, cannot recruit new people as they are still a government-aided body.
