Tellytown is abuzz with rumours of the popular duo   Sheikh and   of ' ' going through a break-up after dating for a couple of months.

 The two shared a great camaraderie when they first met on the sets of the show, and were reportedly in a relationship. A source said, “Shaheer was in a   with an Indonesian singer Ayu Ting Ting earlier, but split with her and found comfort in his friendship with Erica. Guess things did not go down well for the couple as they split around the time of the first anniversary celebrations of the show. At the anniversary party a month ago, the two avoided each other and refused to cut the cake together. Even after it was cut by other cast members, they refused to feed each other the cake.” Sources also confirmed that they share cold vibes on the set and do not talk to each other. 
 
 However, when we spoke to Shaheer and Erica, they surprised us by refusing that they were ever in a relationship. Shaheer said, “Erica is a great co-actor and she is fun to be with. I don’t understand where the break-up story came from because I never dated her. We share a great friendship on the set. All these talks are false.” Erica, too, denied that she dated Shaheer. She said, “People have nothing to do these days. Idle mind is a devil’s workshop. I have never dated Shaheer, so how is there any split?” Well, we may never know what the truth of the matter is, but we hope the two 
 continue to be friends at least.
