NEW DELHI:   will soon be   with the Delhi government set to notify rules to this effect in a month, revenue minister Kailash Gahlot told the assembly on Wednesday. Sikh   are currently registered under the Hindu Marriage Act.

 The issue came up for discussion after   MLA Manjinder Singh   expressed concern over how Sikhs were still registering their marriages under the Hindu Marriage and said that the House must resolve to ensure that they got their due as a minority. He urged members to adopt a resolution for a separate Sikh identity, for which “a minor constitutional amendment” was required.
 
 Sirsa said Buddhists, Jaina and Sikhs must be “equated” with Hindus “as these are separate religions”. 
 
 He went on to explain that Article 25 is an article of faith in constitution, incorporated in recognition of the principle that the real test of true democracy is the ability of even an insignificant minority to find its identity under the country's constitution.
 
 He appealed to the members of the House that to pass a resolution “so that the discrimination done to Buddhist, Jain and Sikhs should be removed and the Parliament of India should duly amend the Article 25 of the constitution of India because welfare of the people is the ultimate goal of all laws and state action and above all the constitution”. He also appealed the Speaker to adopt his resolution for passing in the assembly and gave notice for the same.
