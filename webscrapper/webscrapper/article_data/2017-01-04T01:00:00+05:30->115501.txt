 Dastur, itâ€™s believed, has a challenging and pivotal part in the Jackie Chan-Sonu Sood movie, Kung Fu Yoga'. The actress plays a spy in the Indo-Chinese venture. For one of the scenes, Amyra was required to fool her co-stars. She disguised herself in such a way that she slipped in with the people around on the set. And when she was called for the scene, none of her co-stars, including Jackie, could recognise her. According to a source from the set, when her co-stars asked her about her get-up, she told them that she had picked the outfit and jewellery from a local market in   to get into the character. Talk about walking an extra mile for the role!
