MUMBAI: A total of 295 departures and 117 arrivals were delayed at the Mumbai   on Monday, according to data collected by flightradar24, a live flighttracking website, at 10pm.

 
 Since   on hold to land are given preference over aircraft waiting to depart, departures were delayed by an average of one hour and arrivals by 30 minutes. The airport’s instrument landing system, a navigation aid that allows air-traffic control to stack arrivals close to each other, is switched off on runway 27 since May 17.
 
 It will remain switched off till June 5 for an upgrade. With only basic navigation aid available for pilots coming in for approach to land, air traffic movement has slowed down, leading to longer circling time over the city.
 
 “With no ILS, the separation between aircraft on approach to land has gone up and so runway 27 is not as efficiently used. But slowly the quantum of delay has been going down,” said an air traffic controller. TNN
