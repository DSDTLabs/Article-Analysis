Vadodara: A resident of Pavi Jetpur was arrested by local crime branch (LCB) of Chhota Udepur police for creating a fake account on Facebook to defame a hardware trader and a girl whom the accused liked.

 Complainant Irfan Khatri approached Bodeli police after he learnt that an FB account in the name of one Neha Gaekwad had uploaded some morphed photos which Khatri had earlier uploaded on his profile. 
 
 Police said that the arrested accused Kamlesh Luhar, who was operating the fake account, had merged Khatri and a girl’s photo in a single frame and commented that the duo was in love. Khatri, who is married, told the police that the girl is one of his friends.
 
 The case was cracked when the police found a mobile number in the fake profile. When tracked, the number was in the name of one Ranjit Luhar. Cops found Luhar, told the police during questioning that his brother Kamlesh had bought the sim card in his name. Police then picked up Kamlesh for interrogation.
 
 Kamlesh admitted that he used the number earlier and had created the fake profile. “Kamlesh said that he liked the girl and since she was friends with Khatri, he had instructed her not to talk with anyone except him. But the girl did not heed to him and therefore he decided to disgrace them,” said A V Katkad, police inspector, Chhota Udepur LCB.
 
 Police also said that Kamlesh was under the impression that if Khatri and the girl are defamed, they would stop talking to each other.
