Vadodara: The District Rural Development Agency and panchayat officials in Dahod has launched a probe into the alleged irregularities in Indira Aavas Yojana (IAY) at Fatehura taluka in the district. It has come to light that aid under the housing scheme was given to 163 persons who had never applied for it. The alleged scam was conducted after a grant under the IAY was disbursed earlier this year. The grant was for applications that were made when the IAY was still under implementation. The scheme was scrapped in 2016. While senior officials were not available for comment, Fatehpura taluka development officer Ramesh Rohit said that the process for disbursement of the aid was to be conducted online. He added that the online registration of 163 persons was done wrongly. The 163 dubious beneficiaries were given aid from the grant that should ideally have been distributed to beneficiaries of the year 2013-14 who had applied when the scheme was still in force. Rohit said that the irregularities came to light when the details of the disbursement of the grant were checked online. Sources said that the incident may not be a goof up, but an attempt to swindle the funds. The total amount that has been distributed to dubious beneficiaries amounts to Rs 75lakh. Rohit said that an offence will be registered regarding the incident and further investigations will take place. The officials, meanwhile, suspended a taluka panchayat accountant Vimala Charpot in connection with the alleged scam. Sources said that the disbursement of grants for the financial year 2013-14 has been done earlier this year in other talukas too. In the case of Fatehpura taluka, the amounts to be disbursed to each beneficiary ranged from Rs 45,000 to Rs 70,000.
