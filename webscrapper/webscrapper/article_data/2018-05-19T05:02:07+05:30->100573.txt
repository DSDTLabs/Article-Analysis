NEW DELHI:   Anil Baijal and   Arvind Kejriwal are embroiled in a fresh confrontation over the   crisis looming large over the city. Kejriwal on Friday said that the LG has not responded to his note, letter and text message through which he sought his help to prevent the crisis.

 
 Baijal hit back saying that the CM should have discussed the matter with him earlier rather than spending time on “dharnas without reason” outside the LG office and sending frantic letters and messages at this late juncture when the matter has escalated to a critical stage.
 
 The LG told Kejriwal that he has already taken up the matter with both the Centre and Haryana. Since water is the only portfolio Kejriwal holds, he should follow-up the matter with Upper Yamuna River Board and other stakeholders for finding a sustainable solution. tnn
