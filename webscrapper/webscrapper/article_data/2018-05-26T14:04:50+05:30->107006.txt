PANAJI: Goa police on Saturday cracked the Betalbatim gang rape case and arrested three accused, all residents of Madhya Pradesh.

 Speaking to TOI, inspector general of police Jaspal Singh said that all three accused are involved in the gang rape case. 
 
 TCP minister Vijay Sardesai said, "Kudos to Goa police for quickly cracking Betalbatim gang rape case with the arrest of all 3 accused from Madhya Pradesh. A case of blackmail, rape & robbery by “tourists”! I have always stressed that quality of tourists should be our focus."
 
 Superintendent of police Arvind Gawas had said the accused stopped the duo at around 9.30pm and started demanding money from the 22-year-old man, who parted with Rs 200. Unsatisfied, they assaulted him and molested the survivor. The trio then bound him and ‘raped’ the girl.
