PANAJI: The state government would issue a clarification on the Supreme Court’s new order of reducing the distance of   near highways to 220 meters from 500 meters in towns where the population is 20,000 or less by Tuesday. 

 The clarification is likely to take forward the   order to close bars within 220 meters of state and national highways. This would allow 1,100 more bars to operate. The state government had earlier identified 3,200-odd bars, which came within 500 meters of highways, whose licences were not to be renewed.
 
 The government is also likely to allow the affected bar owners to relocate their liquor shops outside the ambit of 500 meters and renew their licences with the same documents.
 
 Speaking to TOI, commissioner of excise Menino D’Souza said that the new order is being analysed and necessary clarifications would be issued soon. “We have not renewed any of the bar licences within the distance of 500 metres and they should not operate until government comes out with clarifications,” he added. 
 
 Nine local bodies including Panaji, Margao Vasco, Ponda, Mapusa, Curchorem-Cacora municipalities and Taleigao, Sancoale and Curti-Khandepar panchayats have a population of more than 20,000.
 
 When asked how bar owners, whose licences were not renewed, would dispose the liquor with them, D’Souza said that the government will come out with a necessary order regarding that. 
 
 He added that as the bar owners do not hold the licence to sell liquor any more, the government would allow them to return the liquor to liquor companies. 
 
 The state government is examining the apex court order before they decide to ask for relief from it.
