PANAJI: Garbage fires keep flaring up in the city and other parts of the state despite a ban on burning of   by the   (NGT) in December 2016, raising doubts about its enforcement by authorities at various levels.

 Two garbage fires in the city in the late evening on Thursday and another on Friday evening sent fire services personnel rushing to the site. “Fire to the dry waste of branches mixed with plastic shows it is done as a means of disposal,” Avertino Miranda of  , said.
 
 The flames engulfing the waste threatened to burn trees nearby. The arrival of fire services personnel to douse the fire saved several trees from burning. 
 
 Remains of burnt plastic near the same spot indicate that garbage had been burnt on an earlier occasion, too. On Friday evening, a fire tender was seen rushing to put off another fire of mixed waste at the football stadium, near Kala Academy at Campal.
 
 With similar incidents being reported in other towns, citizens allege that workers of municipal councils are setting fires with least regard to the NGT ban while authorities have adopted a lax attitude to the problem.
 
 A Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) official stated that the local self-governing bodies should monitor the scene within their jurisdiction, as they have been informed to control burning of waste.
