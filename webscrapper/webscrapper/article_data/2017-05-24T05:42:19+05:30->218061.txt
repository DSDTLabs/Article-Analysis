CHENNAI: Usha is 32, a single mother and unemployed for five years. “I had to quit my last job because the medicines I was prescribed made me severely drowsy after 6pm,” she says. And there was no way she could tell the HR manager she was schizophrenic.

 So, when volunteers of   (SCARF) where she has been availing   decided to bring down   on Tuesday, Usha, and many others like her, readily turned up. 
 
 Arun M, owner of Thanya Enterprises, one of the companies in the recruitment drive, has been absorbing SCARF’s clients to work at his petrol outlet for many years now. “There’s no trouble. What it takes is granting them impromptu breaks or off days at times they are not doing too well,” he says.
 
 But the same reason also seems to have deterred many companies – especially big corporates – from opening their mid or top-level positions to these people. 
 
 Thirty-two year-old Bhaskaran, an MSc and MPhil with over three years of teaching experience at a city college, says his offers at the fair included those of a sales executive at a Reliance supermarket and a fuel station — neither of which he was too enthused to take up“I resigned from my teaching job after I was diagnosed with the Schizophrenia in 2015. I have attended ten interviews since, but there’s been no luck,” he says.
 
 Dr Mangala of SCARF says although they were able to rope in companies with lower level jobs, it has been a challenge getting engineering or IT vacancies. “We must accept that the illness takes a toll on one’s productivity,” she says. 
 
 However, there are employers such as Krishna Kumar and Sundaram Constructions who are willing to give it a fair try.
