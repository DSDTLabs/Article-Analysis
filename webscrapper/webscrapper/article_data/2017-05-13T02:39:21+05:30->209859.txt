NAVI MUMBAI: The Navi Mumbai crime branch team probing the ‘OneCoin’ ponzi   that was busted in April have trailed the money transactions to 35 bank accounts in Delhi, Rajkot and Koparkhairane. While the cops have found only Rs 24.57 crores in nine bank accounts, the scamsters have withdrawn around Rs 75 crore from the remaining 26 bank accounts, which now have nil balance.

 DCP (crime)   said, “We are probing if Rs 75 crore have been transferred by the accused to international bank accounts. If that has been done then recovery of investors’ money might be difficult.”
 
 He said, “Out of the nine bank accounts tracked so far, a collective sum Rs 24 crore was deposited in a Delhi and a Rajkot branch. Rest of the seven bank accounts had smaller amounts ranging from Rs 5-10 lakh.” Eighteen promoters of the scheme were arrested on April 22.
