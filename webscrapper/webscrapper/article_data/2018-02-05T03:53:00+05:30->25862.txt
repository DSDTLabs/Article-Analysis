Vijayawada: Telugu Desam Party president and chief minister N Chandrababu   has asked his MPs to protest in the parliament over various issues, including the meagre allocation of funds to AP in the Union budget.

 In a meeting on Sunday, the CM said this would send a strong message that not enough is being done for the state after bifurcation. Naidu directed the MPs to not stress on the issue of reorganisation of constituencies in AP. He told them that the   is demanding that only because it was part of the AP Reorganisation Act (2014). He asked them to take up raw deal the state has got in issues such as special package, and Polavaram project, much to the anger of people.
 
 “More than anything else, interests and sentiments of people are important to us, and not the politics,” he told them in a parliamentary meeting held on Sunday. Speaking to the MPs, he said that all these days he was urging the Union government to “allocate more funds to state as it deserves more hand holding than other states, and allocation of money should not be on par with other states”. 
 
 He even told Union minister of state Sujana Chowdary that he waited for four budgets for justice to be done. “How long can I wait?” he asked Chowdary. He told the MPs to take up the protest without hesitation. 
 
 Ex-MP and former AP representative in Union government, Kambhampati Rammohan Rao, who also participated in the meeting, told TOI: “The CM was very clear on issues like Polavaram, railway zone for Viskahapatnam, Amaravati, and the special package. He said the TDP should tell the people about the injustice done by the Centre.” Union minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju could not attend the meeting as he is unwell.
