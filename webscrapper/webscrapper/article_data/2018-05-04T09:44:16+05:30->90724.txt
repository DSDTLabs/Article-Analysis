 (Mysuru): In an unfortunate incident, a 60-year-old   named Bakra by the   officials, died when it got trapped inside a ditch at Dammanakatte Haadi in Heggada Devana (HD) Kote taluk on Thursday.

 Ironically, the ditch that Bakra fell into was dug to prevent elephants straying into the village. Residents of the village said that the tusker fell inside the ditch around 2am on Thursday. “Owing to the force with which the   fell inside the ditch, its tusks stuck in the mud. With its legs trapped in the slush, it was unable to move. Bakra tried to heave himself up, but he was unable to do so since the ditch was full of mud,” a Dammanakatte Hundi resident said.
 
 Locals said that the elephant could be found roaming at Antarasanthe, Metikuppe and Belleguppi villages. “We named it Bakra because of its tusks, which were long and round in shape,” they said.
 
 ‘Tusker tried to kill forest watcher’
 
 The residents recalled a five-month-old incident wherein Bakra had allegedly tried to kill forest watcher Cheluva. “Thankfully, he escaped with a few injuries since the elephant was not in a position to chase him,” the villagers said
 
 Assistant conservator of forests for Antarasanthe AC Povaiah said, “This was the eldest tusker in this range. Bakra was larger than the Dasara elephant Arjuna. He grew weak owing to age-related problems.”
