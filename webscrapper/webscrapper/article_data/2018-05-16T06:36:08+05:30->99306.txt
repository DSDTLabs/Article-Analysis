RAIPUR: After Congress's below par performance in the   assembly polls, former chief minister  's son and   leader has poked fun at   president   ahead of his proposed visit to Chhattisgarh on Thursday by using a series of emoji expressions.

 
 "Among all these emojis, which one will be your facial expression when you come to Marwahi?" Ajit Jogi's legislator son Amit tweeted on Tuesday, referring to Congress president Rahul's who is set to visit the assembly constituency represented by him.
 
 Marwahi assembly constituency in Bilaspur district is considered as a traditional stronghold of the Jogis as former CM Ajit Jogi had earlier represented it when he became the state's first CM after Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh in November 2000.
 
 Later, his son Amit won the Marwahi seat, which is reserved for ST candidates.
 
 With Rahul scheduled for a two-day visit to Chhattisgarh from May 17, Janata Congress stumped the main opposition party in the state by booking all the grounds in the town for three days for their own public meetings. Janata Congress has announced that Ajit Jogi would hold simultaneous events when Rahul visits Pendra. Janata Congress also alleged that Congressis trying to storm the traditional stronghold of the Jogis in Pendra.
 
 Stung by Janata Congress's move, Congress apparently planned Rahul Gandhi's "Jungle Satyagraha" at Kotmi in Marwahi assembly constituency, where Congress is expected to mobilise a large number of tribals to attend the event. Janata Congress also sought to embarrass Congress by saying that the venue is part of a graveyard.
