Celluloid and the small screen have always had a healthy exchange and it isn’t uncommon for our Sandalwood celebrities to make appearances at small screen events and TV shows. Here’s a dekko at the fashion statements made by the hotsteppers of the   industry the past week. 
Manvitha Harish
 The actor sizzled in an off-shoulder 
 number when she went as a guest on Shivarajkumar’s new chat show —  . What’s more, she even twinned with her choice of colour with her co-star and the show’s host as is evident in the picture.
 
  N Simha and  
  
  
 Men of the moment   and   were also on a chat show recently and surprised us with their impressive choice of ensemble. While Dhananjaya chose to be dressed in a rare shade of grey and light pink, Vasishta looked dapper in a bandhgala.
 
 Rashmika Mandanna
 
  
  
 She has been on a roll this week and upped the hotness a notch higher by going ethnic for an award function on Saturday. Clad in a 61-year-old sari that was handed down by her grandmother and mother, the actor chose to be attired the traditional Coorgi way for the big day. 
 
 Ashika Ranganath
 
  
  
 The Mugulu Nage & Raju Kannada Medium actor has a clear knack of picking up vibrant and chic outfits and was togged in one such number for her 
 appearance on Majaa Talkies. Perfect in pink, yeah?
