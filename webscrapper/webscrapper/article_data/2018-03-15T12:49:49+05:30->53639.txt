TRICHY: The fire that ravaged Theni’s   hills claiming 11 lives has thrown a spanner in the works of the railways’ annual two-day trekking expedition scheduled to commence on March 30. With the government imposing a ban on trekking in the summer months,   authorities are not hopeful of securing permission this year.

 The annual exercise is mainly intended to de-stress employees and this time they had planned to trek to Ooty. All department heads were asked to finalise the list of candidates who had registered themselves for the camp planned at Ketti near Ooty. A hundred campers from all divisions / workshops were proposed to participate in the programme. The campers had to be medically fit and pay a camp fee of Rs 1,000 towards boarding, catering and transportation expenses. Ten campers from each division and the headquarters office and five each from workshops were to be accommodated. The campers were to report at the office of the station superintendent in Coimbatore on March 30 at 6 am, stated a Southern Railway circular. 
 
 With neighbouring Kerala and Karnataka governments also temporarily imposing a ban on trekking in forest areas, officials are sceptical of going ahead with their Ooty plan. While senior officials in the Trichy railway division said that they had not come across any trekking expedition plans, sources in   division confirmed that trekking programme for employees of five divisions such as Chennai, Trichy, Madurai, Salem and Palakkad was planned.
 
 As the trekking had already been scheduled (dated February 19, 2018) there would not be any change, they claimed. It would not be a risky one as the programme was planned as a refreshment for the employees, they added.
