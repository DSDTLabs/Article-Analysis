NEW DELHI: A 37-year-old man was arrested by the Customs for allegedly trying to smuggle into the country   valued at about Rs 57 lakh at   airport. Sleuths say that the gold was in the form of gold bars and had been concealed in a roll of electric wires to avoid detection.

 The incident took place on Wednesday night, when the accused, arriving from Riyadh on flight GF 134, was intercepted by Customs sleuths after he crossed the green channel. Officials said something ‘suspicious’ was detected in his luggage and a detailed examination of both the passenger and the luggage was subsequently conducted. The examination revealed gold bars which had been concealed inside a roll of electric wires hidden inside his luggage.
 
 “Eight gold bars weighing 2 kgs were recovered from the baggage. The gold bars were wrapped around with a thick electric wire roll so as to avoid detection,” said a customs official.
 
 The passenger was placed under arrest under section 104 of the Customs Act and the gold has been seized, officials added.
