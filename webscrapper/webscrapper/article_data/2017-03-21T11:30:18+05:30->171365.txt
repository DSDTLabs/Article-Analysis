HYDERABAD:   found driver Nagaraju had a  , probably caused by a brick or a blunt object, and died after the hit. But even 48 hours after   allegedly killed Nagaraju, police are yet to ascertain the motive behind the murder.

 Police were pursuing the case from all angles, including sodomy. Investigators said neither  's son Sukruth, an LLB second-year student, nor victim Nagaraju knew anyone at   where the murder took place on terrace.
 
 Jubilee Hills police said Sukruth went with driver Nagaraju to the five-storied apartment on Friday night.Finding there was no watch man, they went straight to the terrace and started drinking. None in any on the flats noticed them.
 
 During their booze session the two reportedly had a tiff and Sukruth allegedly hit the driver with a brick. As Nagaraju fainted, Sukruth panicked and left around 11 pm. But he returned around 1 am. Realising that Nagaraju had died, he used a big plastic sheet to cover the body and left the premises.
 
 He later returned wearing a T-shirt and shorts around 9 pm on Saturday to move the body and reached the terrace with a towel in his hands. He had hardly moved the body to the fourth floor when one of the flat owners came out and saw Sukruth dragging something. On being questioned, he gave vague answers. But the flat resident smelt something fishy and came out. He saw the body in the plastic cover and immediately alerted other occupants and called the police.
 
 As people gathered, Sukruth fled from the location.His father Venkateshwar Rao was reportedly waiting in an auto outside the apartment complex to help his son dispose of the body.
 
 â€œCCTV footage at the apartment helped us in identifying the victim and the culprit. Nagaraju knew Sai Kalyan apartment's earlier watchman and had consumed liquor on the terrace earlier too. The victim had been working as driver for the culprits' mother for the last six years,'' deputy commissioner of police (West Zone) A Venkateshwar Rao said.
