RAJKOT: By hoisting a flag and silver chhatra (canopy) over Somnath Mahadev temple and participating in ‘arti’ ritual, Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) convenor   wound up his three-day tour to   on Saturday. 

 Arriving at Somnath with a cavalcade of 182 cars Hardik performed a puja before lord Somnath Mahadev.
 
 “Hardik urged the Mahadev (Shiva) to do justice to Patidar community. On Friday, Hardik’s rally was given a grand reception at Virpur and Kagwad Khodaldham, where he performed a puja before Khodiyar Mataji, invoking the goddess to give an impetus to the Patidar stir and make it successful,” a senior PAAS leader said. 
 
 On Friday night, there was a massive road show organized to welcome Hardik’s rally at Keshod in Junagadh district. “After the termination of the rally at Somnath, Hardik held a long meeting with PAAS leaders to chalk out future course of action,” the PAAS leader added.
 
 Meanwhile,   MP from Porbandar Vitthal Radadiya, who is also a prominent Patidar leader, lambasted Hardik and his close aides calling them a disgrace for the community. “He (Hardik) has no right to call himself a community leader. He is not worth of it. People need to identify real community leaders (ahead of elections). We are the ones who spoke for the community in difficult times,” he said.
 
 Radadiya was speaking at a function to inaugurate several projects in Jetpur on Friday night, and about the same time Hardik’s cavalcade reached Keshod.
 
 The MP also used abusive language for Hardik and his aides and said PAAS was a group of cheaters. “Who is this Dinesh Bhambhaniya (close aide of Hardik)? Ask the people who he has cheated. He has siphoned off crores of rupees of traders in Jasdan. Now he wears a cap and calls himself a PAAS leader. People need to look at his background first,” said Radadiya, who had last year tried to mediate with Hardik over reservation demands when the latter was lodged in prison in Surat.
