CHANDIGARH:   councillor   was taken into judicial custody on Monday after losing his challenge against guilty verdict in a case related to the allotment of sheds at the Sector-26 Grain Market.

 Additional district and sessions judge  , who upheld the lower court’s sentence against Babla, will pronounce the quantum of sentence on March 31. In August 2009, police had booked former market committee chairman   and grain market arhtiya (commission agent) association president Rakesh for cheating, forgery, and criminal conspiracy after detecting irregularities in the allotment of 69 vending platforms. On July 22, 2014, a civil judge (junior division) had convicted Babla of cheating but released him on a year’s probation.
 
  
  
 
 After preliminary investigation based on complainant Suraj Parkash Ahuja’s affidavit, the FIR (first-information report) was registered on August 19, 2009. Babla was then chairman of the market committee and signatory to the forged papers of allotment of places for selling vegetables under the new sheds. During the auction on July 24, 2009, the market committee led by Babla accommodated 10 ineligible bidders. Babla was booked after a fallen shed had to be re-allocated.
 
 The Congress leader surrendered on December 28, 2009, after a local court ordered him to either appear or be declared a proclaimed offender. In February 2010, a special investigation team (SIT) of   submitted the charge sheet against Babla. Key witness and marketing committee assistant secretary G R Pillai retracted his police statement during the trial, but another witness, market committee official Ranjit Singh, corroborated the allegations, to which the defence tried to attach political motives, saying the objective was to ruin Babla’s political career.
