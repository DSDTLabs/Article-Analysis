CHANDIGARH: With outnumbered   fielding candidates for all the three posts in the mayoral elections, the party is hoping against hope.

 Devinder Singh Babla will contest for the post of mayor, while Sheela Devi and Ravinder Kaur are vying for the seats of senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor, respectively. All the three candidates filed their nominations on Tuesday.
 
 Having just four councillors in the house of 26, hopes of the party hinges on cross-voting by unhappy   ( ) councillors and nominated councillors getting back their voting rights, which have been quashed by the Punjab and Haryana high court.
 
 The BJP is divided into two groups led by   and Sanjay Tandon and both are locked in a tussle over the mayor’s post. The internal tussle has come to fore on many occasions, with cross-voting by its members in different elections, the latest being when one of its five candidates, Heera Negi, lost the election of the   and   (F&CC) to Babla. Cross-voting cost the party dear in 2015 mayoral elections, when Congress’s Poonam Sharma bagged the mayor’s post despite BJP having a majority with 16 councillors. In 2000,   Goel of Congress went on to win the mayor election despite the party not having majority.
 
 The Congress is also hoping the nine nominated councillors get back their voting rights. Their fate will be decided on January 5 in the Supreme Court. According to sources, if the nominated councillors are allowed to vote, Congress will try to exploit the factionalism within BJP. The majority of the nominated councillors support Sanjay Tandon.
 
 Chandigarh Congress president Pradeep Chhabra said the BJP has past of its members voting against their own party. “We have secured victories even when BJP was in a majority. They have history of going against their own candidates,” Chhabra said.
