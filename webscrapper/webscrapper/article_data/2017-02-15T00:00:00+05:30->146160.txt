Now, all it takes is one single click to have a   violation registered against you. The   police now have an app installed in the phones of traffic constables, who can use it to click photographs and videos to record any cases of violations. This app also will help as evidence for any   cases. All these will be stored in the Traffic Monitoring Centre ( ). 
Hubballi commissioner   says, “We are using it to detect cases pertaining to violation of traffic rules. We also plan to use this app to maintain law and order during procession and other cases. 28,500 photographs have been recovered in the TMC, out of which around 9,500 notices have been generated. We are in the process of generating more and because of the initial stages, the procedure is slow. Our target is to curb traffic violations, especially those by autorickshaw drivers and private vehicles. We also will use photographs and videos taken as evidence for law and order cases, which are reported and everything will be stored in the TMC.”
