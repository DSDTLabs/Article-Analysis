Kannada superstar   announced the official launch of the   ( ), a   tournament that will bring talent from the industry and the media together to figure out who’s the best.

  An idea that evolved during his days with the celebrity cricket tourney, for which he led the Sandalwood side, Sudeep explained that the KCC would give talent from across different fields of filmmaking — be it producers, directors, editors, lyricists, etc, — who were hitherto ineligible to play other tournaments, a platform to showcase they their cricketing skills. As for the ladies from the industry, Sudeep said that they would be welcome to extend their support in whatever means possible, like, for instance, commentary, etc., and eventually, maybe even form teams to play the tournament. KCC, he said, would be conducted twice a year, in a T10 format, to enable maximum number of matches during the two-day tournament, the first of which is slated to be conducted in early April.
