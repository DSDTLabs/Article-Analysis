The easiest   is by popping a pill. It takes just a few seconds and you are finished. But pills cost money and often have side effects. Fully relaxing your body and your mind for a few minutes a day could lower your systolic   (the top number of a blood pressure reading) by 10 points or more—at no cost, and with no side effects.
 
  Researchers with the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind-Body Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital compared a stress management technique called the relaxation response with education about lifestyle changes such as sodium reduction, weight loss, and exercise. They found:
  
  • Blood pressure decreased more in the relaxation response group
  • 32% of the volunteers in that group were able to eliminate one blood pressure medication and still keep their blood pressure under control, compared with 14% of the lifestyle group.
  The relaxation response has been shown to reduce heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and muscle tension. Here's how to do it:
  • Select a word (such as "om" or "peace"), a short phrase, or a prayer to focus on.
  • Sit quietly in a comfortable position and close your eyes.
  • Relax your muscles, progressing from your feet to your calves, thighs, abdomen, and so on, up to your neck and face.
  • Breathe slowly through your nose, silently saying your focus word, phrase, or prayer to yourself as you exhale.
  • When other thoughts come to mind, don't worry. Simply return your attention to your focus word, phrase, or prayer.
  • Do this for 10–20 minutes.
  • Sit quietly for a minute or so, and then open your eyes.
  • Practice the relaxation response once or twice a day.
