MUMBAI: Discharged from   hospital in Mumbai on Thursday morning, NCP leader and former deputy chief minister  , who was recently granted bail in the   case, said the truth would be out soon. NCP president Sharad Pawar was the first to speak to him over the phone after he was discharged. 

 "I was arrested for corruption in the allotment of contract for construction of New Delhi's Maharashtra Sadan, but no one has doubted the quality of the construction. In fact, whoever visited Maharashtra Sadan, including the Prime Minister, has showered praise on the landmark building," Bhujbal said.
 
 "I was in jail for more than two years. For the last three months, my health has not been good. I was taking treatment at KEM and, after a few days, will be admitted to   hospital. I may have to undergo certain procedures and surgeries. If doctors permit, I will attend NCP's June 10 convention in Pune," Bhujbal said.
 
  Bhujbal said that in politics, certain "inevitable" events take place, but the skies have now cleared. "Sooner or later, people will know the truth. The media should have probed the allegations against me," he said.
