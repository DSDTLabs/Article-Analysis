RAJKOT:   activists demanded land from the government, for members of the community to be empowered, and called on Patidars and OBC leaders to help secure the release of this land if they really mean it when they say that they are with dalits in their fight against the government.

 Martin Macwan, dalit rights activist, while addressing ‘Dalit Swabhiman Sammelan’ in Rajkot on Thursday at   ground, said Patidar leader   and OBC leader Alpesh Patel have expressed their support for dalits.
 
 “If they say that they are really with dalits, I ask them to help dalits get their  . Why they are silent on atrocities committed by members of their own community on dalits?” Macwan asked.
 
 Various dalit leaders including Jignesh Mevani attended the gathering. 
 
 Mevani had to be escorted off the stage for his own safety after he criticized dalit leader and BSP supremo Mayawati on certain issues. Supporters of Mayawati were up in arms and rushed on to the stage, demanding that Mevani apologize for his statements. Mevani was no able to speak again and had to be escorted off for his own safety.
 
 Macwan tried to pacify the angry BSP supporters saying that if they wanted to thrash Mevani, they would have to thrash him first. He cited the example of Dr B R Ambedkar’s fight against the caste system and asked dalits to stay united in times of crisis.
