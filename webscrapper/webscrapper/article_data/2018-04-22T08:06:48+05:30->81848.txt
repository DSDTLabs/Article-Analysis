HUBBALLI:  , (in pic), the JD(S) candidate from   constituency demanded an inquiry over properties owned by former chief minister and opposition leader in assembly Jagadish  . 

 Speaking to reporters here on Saturday, Koravi said that there are several allegations against Shettar that he owns properties at various places and added that an inquiry will reveal the fact. "Allegations that Shettar owns properties near the airport, has a role in the Gymkhana issue and others are serious," he added.
 
 "There is a positive wave in favour of JD(S) in the constituency. People who are willing to see the change are expressing their ire against Shettar. In the past three months, we have reached out to people from 11 wards under 'Mane Manege Kumaranna' programme. More such programs have been planned to reach out to more people. After filing the nomination on April 23 a night stay programme will be organized in each of the wards that fall under the constituency," he said.
 
 "During the previous assembly election,   candidate Dr   got over 40,000 votes just because of anti-incumbency against Shettar and not due to the former's individual capacity," said Koravi.
 
 "C M Nimbannavar, who was disappointed with BJP after he was denied a ticket, had approachedour party chief H D   for a ticket. But as Nimbannavar's followers urged him to contest as an independent, he has decided not to join JD(S)," said Koravi.
 
 Damayanti Annigeri, Suresh Patil, Shivanand Sunagar, Shankargouda Patil and others were present.
