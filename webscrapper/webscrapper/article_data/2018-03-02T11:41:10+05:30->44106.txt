TRICHY: As Class XII state board exams began on Thursday, coaching centres in the city started aggressive promotion and marketing for ‘crash courses’ they would be offering ahead of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test ( ).

 Representatives from several coaching academies stationed outside the exam centre premises with pamphlets and brochures, which they had handed out to the Class XII students. NEET is scheduled for May 6 and Class XII board exams will get over in the first week of April. 
 
 Coaching centres zeroed in the first day of board exam as the perfect time to intensify marketing their one-month crash courses. Several schemes like scholarships, discount in fees and free course materials were included as special offers. 
 
 The demand for crash courses is more than the year-long NEET courses and that is the reason why coaching centres are trying to tap as many candidates as possible, said T Pugazhendi, director of   & Engineering Entrance Exams. “It’s because many parents and students have the mindset that it’s so hard to clear NEET and they don’t really concentrate on it till the board exams get over. Naturally, parents get tempted to admit their children for NEET coaching during the 34-day gap between board and NEET exam,” the director told TOI. 
 
 He also claimed that only less than five percent of students in the city have been preparing for NEET exam throughout the year. His academy only does SMS marketing and not pamphlets and brochures promotions, he added.
