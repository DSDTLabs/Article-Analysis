JAIPUR: The Union government is gradually giving everything into private hands with the sole aim of finishing reservation in the country, accused social activist  , stating that its chief planning body,   is working to achieve the aim by promoting jobs through private recruitment agencies. 

 "Niti Aayog has prepared a three-year action plan which was approved in a meeting chaired by Prime Minister   last week. The plan says that outsource service delivery where possible and to reduce dependence on government administrative machinery wherever possible," said Roy while address a gathering at Mela Ground in   to mark the International May Day on Monday. The event was organised by   (MKSS).
 
 She added that they will be using Aadhaar-based identity verification to allow private channels to provide services wherever possible. "Identification of such services should be taken up and PPP models to provide those services should be explored," said Roy.
 
 She also spoke about the dangers of cow vigilantes, love jihad and said that targeting one community is posing a threat to law and order in the country. Braving the heat, over 500 villagers, mostly labourers gathered at Bhim. The chilling tales of labourers suffering from the silicosis facing government apathy has shocked the audience.
 
 Nikhil Dey of MKSS questioned the Union government for making Aadhaar card mandatory in social sector schemes when   ruling says that card can't be made mandatory for any government scheme? "Here in the mela several women have told us that they were denied work due to Aadhaar card which they didn't produce," said Dey. 
 
 The villagers were seen united against the ban on liquor in the state. Most of the speakers have talked about the liquor ban which received nod from the audience. Two panchyats - Madawar and Barjal in Bhim block informed about the movement they have launched for ban on liquor shops in their area.
