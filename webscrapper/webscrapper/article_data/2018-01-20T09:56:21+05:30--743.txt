 Broadly, there are two ways to get an internet signal onto something that is 35,000 feet above ground:
 
 1. Ground-to-air
 -Technology uses ground-based mobile broadband towers
 -Aircraft installed with antennae on the fuselage pick up signals from ground towers that are closest to flight path
 -The technology isn't highly reliable for on-board connectivity on flights that fly over vast water-bodies like the oceans
 
 
 2. Via satellite
 -Expected to be more popular in the future
 -Satellite technology overcomes the hurdle of receiving signals over vast water bodies
 -Aircraft antennae connect to satellites in geostationary orbit (satellites that rotate along with the Earth and so, in effect, remain stationary with respect to the Earth) using receivers and transmitters
 -All information between ground and aircraft is passed via satellite
 -Once the aircraft's antennae pick up signals, on-board routers distribute the   signal throughout the aircraft
 -Satellite connection can offer speeds of about 12 mbps
 
 
 
 
 1.  , a British satellites telecommunication company, predicts that over half of the world's aircraft will be equipped for in-flight wifi within six years. This is set to become a billion-dollar revenue sector by 2020
 
 2.   estimates the global market for connected aircraft at $7 billion and a rapid wifi adoption by nearly 25,000 planes by 2025. Honeywell's JetWave hardware connects aircraft to Inmarsat's GX Aviation service to provide   service with speeds up to 50 mbps
 
 
 
 
 1. In-flight connectivity is much more expensive than on-ground connectivity
 
 2. Most airlines charge based on use - whether wifi is used on phone, tablet, or laptop
 
 3. Laptop connectivity is the most expensive
 
 4. Gogo, a popular US-based in-flight broadband internet service provider that gives service to 17 airlines, offers a 'monthly airlines plan', valid on domestic flights in the US, Canada and Mexico
 
 
 
 
 Such airlines include:
