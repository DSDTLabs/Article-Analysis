CHENNAI:   (2014) Kailash Satyarthi, who delivered a lecture in the city on Sunday, appealed to the public to defend the rights of children and fight for their education. Satyarthi was speaking at the Rotary   Literacy Summit which was inaugurated by Union HRD minister   on Friday and attended by representatives from SAARC nations Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. 

 Recalling his interest in child rights, Satyarthi shared an anecdote from his days in Vidisha district, Madhya Pradesh. The young activist had been 11 when he came across children in his neighbourhood not going to school as they did not have books. Satyarthi said, "It was the year 1965 when I shared this idea with a childhood friend. We decided to rent a vegetable cart and go to different neighbourhoods requesting people to donate used books. Within five hours, we managed to collect nearly 2,500 books."
 
 Satyarthi who has fought to protect the rights of nearly one lakh children from more than a hundred countries recalled tales of horror during attempts to rescue children under bondage. 
 
 "Three days ago, at   (which he runs), I noticed that a 10-year-old boy was not able to walk. He had been freed three weeks ago, along with a dozen other children 13-14 years old. When I approached him, he told me that he had been forced to work sitting in the same posture for 22 hours a day in a   in Delhi."
