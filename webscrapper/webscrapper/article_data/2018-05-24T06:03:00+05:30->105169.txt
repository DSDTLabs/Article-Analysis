Kolkata: The swearing-in of H D Kumaraswamy as Karnataka CM in Bengaluru on Wednesday went far beyond the formation of a state government. The event at Vidhana Soudha turned out to be a dress rehearsal for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, throwing up insights into how the anti-BJP alliance will shape up and who will be the major players in its formation. 

 Trinamool Congress chief   Banerjee batted for regional parties and held that her party was working for a federal set-up. “Congress will say what they want to. We have nothing to do with what Congress says. We will keep in touch with all the regional parties so that we can work for the development of the nation, development of the people and development of the federal set-up also. This is the victory of a regional party,” she said, trying to carve out a route different from that of the national-level coalitions led by national parties earlier. 
 
 Lalu Prasad’s son and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav touched Banerjee’s feet while she was talking to TDP’s N Chandrababu Naidu.
 
 A closer look at the optics corroborated her view. The West Bengal CM was more at home with regional players such as BSP’s Mayawati, SP’s Akhilesh Yadav, DMK’s Stalin and Chandrababu Naidu than with Congress seniors Sonia Gandhi and Rahul. She didn’t lack the courtesy of wishing Congress president Rahul or greeting Sonia when they met her while walking to their seats, but the Trinamool chief was seen walking away from a joint photo session with Naidu until Kumaraswamy brought her back to the middle of the line-up.
 
 Banerjee had pledged her support to Kumaraswamy ahead of Karnataka polls. “We are present here to support Kumaraswamy-ji and his government and we hope for the best,” she said.
