LUCKNOW: Terming opposition parties as “dream merchants“ and “opportunists“,   national president   Yadav on Sunday criticised them for playing with the sentiments of people for political gains.

 Attacking the NDA government, Akhilesh said the BJP had promised achhe din but failed to deliver unlike the SP which fulfilled the promises it had made before coming to power in 2012.
 
 “BJP had promised achhe din. It's been three years, but people are still waiting for the good times. They promised achhe din but ended up giving brooms in people's hands in the name of Swachh Bharat,“ Akhilesh said.
 
 He said the BJP needs to define `achhe din' so that people can decipher what they have got. “We have fulfilled all the promises that we made in our 2012 manifesto and completed projects which were not (even) promised,“ SP president said.He said those who promised good times made several attempts to whip up communal passions in the state but such efforts were thwarted by the UP government. Now, in the midst of elections, the BJP-led NDA government might come up with a new promise, Akhilesh added.
 
 Lambasting BSP for luring Muslims, Akhilesh said the party is desperately working on caste alignments and trying to mislead the people. Mayawati has given tickets to 97 Muslims for the assembly polls, the highest ever fielded by BSP in UP elections. Targeting BSP chief Mayawati for constructing monuments and parks in her regime, Akhilesh said, “Woh patthar jo Lucknow aur Noida me lage hain, yaad dilaate hain agar sarkaar ban gayi to isse bade bade haathi laga diye jayenge (The statues installed in Dalit parks in Lucknow and Noida remind people that if the BSP returns to power then it will install bigger statues of elephant).
