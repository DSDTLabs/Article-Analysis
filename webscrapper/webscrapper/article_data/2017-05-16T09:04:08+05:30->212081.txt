Panaji: With the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) deciding against renewing consent to operate documents till further air quality monitoring is done at  , Sattari, operations at 12 of the 13 mining leases there will continue to be suspended. GSPCB member secretary Levinson Martins confirmed the development. 

 The next board meeting is likely to held on Friday.
 
 The decision was taken after GSPCB officials compared two separate sets of data collected from the ambient air quality monitoring stations installed by the board and by the mining companies, and found that the numbers did not match.
 
 “We have also decided to collect bank guarantees from 27 mines before the leases and consent to operate documents are issued to them,” an official of the GSPCB told TOI. A total of 39 mines have approached the board to obtain consent to operate.
 
 On April 28, the board had put a stop to mining in Sonshi village, and refused to permit 12 mines to operate in the area. The move had come after it had issued showcause notices to 13 mining companies on April 27 for causing significant air pollution in the vicinity of the village.
 
 The high court of Bombay at Goa had also said there should be no mining-related traffic on Sonshi’s road till the showcause notices issued by the GSPCB are decided upon.
