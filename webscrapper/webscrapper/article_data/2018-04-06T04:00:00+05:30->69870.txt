Surat: If all goes well, the Diamond City will get more flights to different destinations in the country. 

 After Air Asia’s plan to commence flight services between Indore and Surat by April end, Indigo Airlines is planning to launch services to destinations like Guwahati, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Delhi by end of May or early June. 
 
 Sources said Indigo authorities are yet to decide on the probable sectors to be included in Surat’s fly list, but they plan to operate three ATRs (Regional Air Transport) and an Airbus. The airline authorities had visited the airport for the time slots and they are likely to seek permission of the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) for launching services from Surat. 
 
 Recently, a delegation from Air Asia led by head of commercial services Kiran Jain visited Surat and organized a series of meetings with the stakeholders from trade and industry, private organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and airport groups crusading for increased air connectivity from Surat. Sources said the airline had conducted a survey for operations at Surat and it revealed vast potential of passenger traffic from Indore to Surat. One of the most important reasons for air traffic is trade ties between the two cities.
 
 Besides diamond, Surat is also a textile manufacturing hub. Traders from both sectors move frequently between Indore and Surat. Earlier, the railways was planning to introduce a train between both cities, but the plan failed.
 
 A member of We Work for a Working Airport at Surat (WWWAS) said, “We hope that Surat will get more air connectivity from May with the arrival of Air Asia and Indigo Airlines. At present, only Spice Jet and Air India are operating from the airport.”
