Dharamshala: A police investigation in a missing persons’ case led to recovery of a body near a farm house at Kandbari area of Palampur in the Kangra district on Saturday, following which a murder case was registered and further investigations initiated. The victim has been identified as Anoop Attri (60), the owner of the farm house.

 Earlier, Attri’s wife Bhawna Kumari, resident of Dari near Dharamshala, in her police complaint had stated that her husband had gone to their farm house in Kandbari on Saturday, September 9, and had not returned since.
 
 Police started investigation at the farm house and recovered blood-stained bedding. Investigating officials combed the nearby forest for two days to look for the missing persons, suspecting that they might have gone to hunt.
 
 Superintendent of Police (SP) Ramesh Chajta said for lack of evidence, the police kept working on the missing complaint. “We collected clues about other persons present in the farm house. Then a team was constituted and sent to Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday. We succeeded to trace one person on Saturday. He was arrested and based on his information, the police have recovered the dead body of the owner of the farm house,” said Chajta, adding that a murder case would now be registered.
 
 “This is not a case of missing persons but domestic helps having killed their employer,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, the body has been sent for postmortem and results are awaited.
 
 The police have refused to disclose the identity of the other accused citing security reasons. “We cannot disclose the names of accused in this case,” said the SP.
