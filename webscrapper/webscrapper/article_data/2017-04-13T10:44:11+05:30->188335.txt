GHAZIABAD: The man who is believed to have committed an identity   and claimed, falsely, that he was driving the   involved in an accident in which four people died in   on January 28 this year, has been arrested in Mumbai.

 Syed Imtiyaz Qadri had gone missing from his Bareilly home ever since it became apparent that he had impersonated Ishak Ahmad, a truck driver who lived in the same house, in a Ghaziabad court and submitted a copy of Ahmad’s driving licence to surrender.
 
 Qadri’s arrest has, however, nothing to do with the Audi accident case. He was arrested for mobile theft and has been booked under Section 392 of the IPC. Mumbai Police wasn’t aware he was the same man Ghaziabad police are looking for in the Audi accident investigation.
 
 Ravinder Badgujar, senior inspector at Mumbai’s Nala Sopara police station, said, “On Wednesday afternoon, we arrested a man identified as Syed Imtiyaz Qadri on the charges of mobile theft. When questioned, he said he hails from Ratnagiri district and lives in Mumbra. We had no idea the Qadri we arrested is wanted by Ghaziabad crime branch. We will contact our Ghaziabad counterparts.”
 
 The case’s investigating officer in Ghaziabad, Jaipal, said he was not aware of the arrest. “This is news to me. We will get in touch with Mumbai police as soon as possible and will ascertain his true identity and seek his transit remand.”
 
 The crime branch of Ghaziabad police has recommended criminal charges against the owner of the Audi, Dr Manish Rawat and Qadri, for manipulating the investigation, providing false information and criminal conspiracy.
 
 Four people travelling in an auto, among them 38-year-old software engineer Rinky Yadav and the auto’s driver, were killed after a head-on collision with the Q7 a little after midnight on Hindon canal road in Indirapuram.
