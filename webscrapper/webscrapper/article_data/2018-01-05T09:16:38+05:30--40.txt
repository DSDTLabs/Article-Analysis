HYDERABAD: In a fresh order that is sure to boost the public healthcare sector, the state health department has asked all new   to get a training of ultrasound machines as many   and other delivery points do not have radiologists to conduct these tests.

 Under such circumstances, patients have to travel long distances to get these tests done at   or at privately-run facilities by paying a huge sum.
 
 The step, envisaged as per the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act and Supreme Court guidelines, is expected to ease congestion at district and teaching hospitals.
 
 Also a ‘state-level, high powered expert committee’ comprising top health department officials and state medical council representatives as members has been constituted for the implementation of the Act.
 
 The committee will meet once in three months and supervise activities related to the six-month doctors training. The committee will also be responsible for “preparation of syllabus, manuals for both theory and logbook assessment/practicals and preparation of question papers and other materials,” reads the order.
 
 The order also gives special powers to the committee to involve officials from other disciplines as well as non-officials, if deemed necessary.
 
 MBBS candidates will be selected from the Directorate of Public Health and Family Welfare and from the T Vaidya Vidhana Parishad.
