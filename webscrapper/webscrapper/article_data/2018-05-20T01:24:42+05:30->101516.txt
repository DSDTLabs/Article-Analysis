GHAZIABAD: A 22-year-old woman, a resident of  , has alleged she was abducted and raped by three men on May 6. 

 
 The woman also levelled allegations against the police for refusing to register an FIR on the night of the crime. The police, however, stated that in her initial complaint to the police, she had not mentioned rape by anyone.
 
 The woman, in a complaint to the SSP’s office on Wednesday, stated that while she along with one of her relatives was returning home from a market on May 6, one Javed, a resident of   colony, stopped a white van in front of her and pulled her inside.
 
 According to the complainant, there were two more persons sitting inside the vehicle and they allegedly raped her inside the car after drugging her. Later, she was dumped near her house around 10pm. 
 
 “I went to the local police station the same night, but neither an FIR was lodged nor a medical test conducted. When I went there the next day, the cops present there got my signature on blank paper and told me that an FIR would be lodged against the accused,” she further claimed.
 
 When contacted, SHO, Sahibabad, R K Singh refuted the allegations levelled by the woman against the cops. “An FIR was lodged against Javed and one unidentified person for abducting her on May 7 itself. It was based on her statement to the police. There was no mention of rape at all. Later, when she mentioned rape by Javed while recording her statement in front of a magistrate, Section 376 (rape) of IPC was added to the FIR. Now, the woman has alleged rape by three. We will get the further investigation done in the case,” Singh said.
