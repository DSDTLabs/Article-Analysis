BHOPAL: Taking cognizance of a complaint filed a by a city resident the Ministry of Human Resource Development ( ) has directed Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology ( ) authorities to order an enquiry into an alleged embezzlement to the tune of Rs 45 crore in developmental works at the college. 

 A Comptroller and Auditor General ( ) report had reportedly unearthed financial discrepancies at MANIT between 2013 and 2015. The report, of which TOI possesses a copy, found disparity in construction of badminton court, academic building, classrooms, barracks, purchase of books for library, outsourcing of employees.and miscellaneous works reviewed by the auditors.
 
 Sources said that the complaint was first received at the PMO which directed MHRD to investigate the case. 
 
 According to the agreement, the work was supposed to be completed in seven months after it started on November 16, 2010. However, the work was delayed, as the concerned construction agency was given fresh deadline of September 15, 2011 with 10% extra cost above the original cost. The deadline was extended repeatedly, with the last one on December 31, 2014. It was found that even the penalty for the delay in work was charged less than the prescribed amount. The CAG has questioned the payment of extra Rs 14.64 crore for the construction.
 
 The MHRD has sought a reply along with the authentic copies of all documents. 
 
 Acting registrar, Prof N D Mittal said the issue is under consideration of the MANIT board . “Finance Committee is also looking into the matter. Let them probe the issue. It is true that inflated bills were submitted. MANIT has stopped the payment till further notification,” said Mittal. He, however, refused to comment on the suspects.
 
 However, Director, MANIT, Prof Vinod Kumar Singh, said, “I have asked the officials to look into the matter. But, I have not yet received a letter from MHRD.”
