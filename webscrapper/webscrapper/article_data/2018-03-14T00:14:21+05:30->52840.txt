Pune: Wind energy equipment maker Suzlon Group has bagged a order from an independent power producer that will help deliver energy to over 45,000 households at its peak.

 While the company did not specify the deal size, industry estimates suggest that the 75MW order could be worth over to Rs 500 crore, including the end-to-end maintenance cost.
 
 The company said in a statement on Tuesday that it has installed and commissioned the largest wind turbine generator in the country – with a rotor diameter of 128 metres. This is an improvement over its 111 metre diameter rotors, and the company claims that this can provide a better performance in low wind sites.
 
 “The S128 series offers about 33% more swept area and is expected to deliver about 32% more energy generation compared to the S111,” the statement added.
