Margao: After receiving numerous complaints from the public with regards to the illegal mobile hawkers causing traffic congestion on the roads in Margao town, the Margao municipal council (MMC) has finally decided to crack the whip on those violating the law. 

 Many of these handcarts selling eatables near the KTC bus stand in Margao, especially near the parking lot, are found occupying parking space for two-wheelers, throughout the day.
 
 “The problem is that these hawkers violate rules that stipulate them to remove the carts after their business comes to a close for the day. I have asked market inspectors to ensure that no carts are found on the roadside or parking lots during the morning hours,” MMC chief officer Agnelo Fernandes said.
 
 The MMC is also in the process of identifying areas to be designated as vending zones, the MMC chief offer said. “Vendors selling fast food items would also be relocated to these zones,” he added.
 
 Handcarts selling food items are often found to be violating all norms of hygiene and sanitation. Though the authorities have drawn guidelines to regulate mobile eateries, the rules are usually flouted. 
 
 Providing packaged drinking water to consumers, using disposable plates and spoons and storing potable water for cleaning utensils in stainless steel vessels fitted with taps, are some of the guidelines that are violated with impunity. 
 
 Besides, the food waste, which is usually found disposed of in the open, attracts stray dogs, adding to the menace. While there are 152 licensed handcarts in the city, an equal number of handcarts are operating on the sly. The chief officer has assured of taking strict action against the illegal handcarts.
