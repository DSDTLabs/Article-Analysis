JAIPUR: As the new   turns his focus on creating jobs within the country and building walls to protect its interests,   is stepping into the vacuum extolling the virtues of globalization and trying to capture the global leadership role.

 While the external manifestations of China’s economic power and military might do give the impression that its ambitions are not overly misplaced, China watchers feel that the internal dynamics in the country can make it harder to attain the goal.
 
 Speaking at a session on whether the 21st century belongs to China,  , author of ‘Street of Eternal Happiness: Big City Dreams Along a Shanghai Road,’ said that while the exponential economic growth in China over the past 30 years has lifted 650 million people out of poverty, the debt-financed construction-led growth after the global subprime crisis was creating multiple challenges for the leadership.
 
 “There’s another 650 million people who are not consumers and the policy shift from exports to consumption is not working as expected. In fact, unemployment too is rising. To quell protests, lawyers are being imprisoned. Internet freedom is curtailed,” said Schmitz.
 
 The Chinese President Xi Jinping is reaching out to rural areas where corruption is rampant and opportunities are less. Schmitz said the president’s policies were very popular in rural areas unlike in urban China. “The leadership knows that it needs to improve the condition of people in rural areas to check the outbreak of collective anger.”
