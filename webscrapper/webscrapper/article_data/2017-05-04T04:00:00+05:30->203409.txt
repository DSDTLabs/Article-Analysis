Surat: An inquiry has been ordered by city police commissioner Satish Sharma against police sub-inspector P M Amin for alleged misconduct as he has been accused by a woman, who lives in an area under Dindoli police station limits, of rape. 

 The woman had earlier submitted a written application to Dindoli police station which after a preliminary inquiry refused to register her complaint. Police inspector of Dinoli police station had given it in writing to the woman that her complaint cannot be registered since she had willingly developed a relationship with the cop. 
 
 “The woman said that she had a relationship with the police officer since he had promised to marry her. Now he has gone back on his words to marry her. This is not a case of rape since there was free consent between the parties concerned,” Satish Sharma said.
 
 “I have ordered an inquiry by a deputy commissioner of police to see if there is any misconduct on the part of the police officer. Action will be taken against the officer if he is found guilty of misconduct,” Sharma said.
 
 The woman came in contact with Amin when he was posted in Dindoli police station. She had gone to lodge a complaint of theft of jewellery when she met Amin. They began to meet regularly during investigation and a relationship developed. 
 
 The woman, who was already married, alleged in her application that he had promised to marry her. The woman claimed that she had filed for divorce from her husband to marry Amin but he now spurns her advances.
