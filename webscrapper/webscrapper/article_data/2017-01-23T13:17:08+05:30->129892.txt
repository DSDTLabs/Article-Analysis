MANGALURU:   has thrown its weight behind "kambala" – the traditional folk sport of coastal part of the state. Recognising the fact that   has its own time tested tradition spanning more than 1,000 years with socio-religious-economic connotations, party has expressed hope that the Karnataka High Court will take due cognizance of these facts when it hears the issue on January 30 and provide justice to practitioners and organisers of this folk sport.

 Batting for the sport, state unit chief   said kambala was caught in the crossfire of a Supreme Court ban on ‘jallikattu’ celebrated in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. “With the case now coming up for hearing on January 30, I am certain that the court will take a holistic view in light of developments that have taken place with regard to jallikattu,” Yeddyurappa told reporters, adding that the need to resort to agitation, protests in this case is unlikely to arise.
 
 The party will also represent nuances of the folk sport to union minister for law and justice and information technology Ravi Shankar Prasad when he visits the state mid-week for official function. “We will impress on the minister about what this folk sport means to the state in general and coastal Karnataka in particular,” Yedyyurappa said adding that the party will impress on him to ensure that laws are suitably amended to allow this folk sport to be held as usual.
 
 The issue was also discussed at the just concluded state executive committee meeting held at Kalaburagi, Yeddyurappa said adding the party is united in backing the sport and ensuring that traditions connected to this sport are held as usual. With the courts clearing the decks for holding of jallikattu in face of massive protests in Tamil Nadu, there is no reason that the courts should not hold a similar view for kambala, he said and hoped for favourable judicial outcome.
