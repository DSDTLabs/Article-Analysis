MANGALURU: Former minister   has described a statement by  , chief whip of the government in state legislative council that PM   must be sent to jail for his demonetisation move as heights of foolishness. Ivan should first understand that 90 per cent of people have supported move by the PM to demonetize 86 per cent high value currency of the face value Rs 500 and Rs 1000 in circulation across India as on November 8.

 Assailing Ivan’s statement last week, Srinivas Poojary said when nations such as Russia, North Korea, Myanmar carried out similar exercise, people of these countries had expressed their lack of confidence in their leadership that took such a decision. Such remarks belittling post of a PM only shows Ivan in poor light, he said reminding Ivan that people have accepted Modi’s decision that has effectively stopped all Congress backed violence in the Kashmir valley.
 
 It is imperative that no one politicise issues concerning economy and defence of the country and this has been time tested tradition in the country, Srinivas Poojary said adding PMs move on demonetisation is a surgical strike on forces that are inimical to nation’s economic progress. Just as the cross border surgical strike on terror launch pads, this move is seen as a surgical strike on the black money economy that was flourishing in India, the former minister noted.
 
 Urging Ivan to ascertain reasons why his party ministers Ramesh Kumar and Kagodu Thimappa have hailed Modi’s demonetization move, he said it is the action of a few unscrupulous elements including corrupt state government who ensure that fresh currency released by the government did not reach the people. Rather than hail PMs sops to the poor in his new year eve address and speak so haughtily will bring its own consequences and people will answer this, he added.
