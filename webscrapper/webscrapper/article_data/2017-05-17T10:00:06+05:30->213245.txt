LUCKNOW: A local court here on Tuesday gave anti-terrorist squad of UP police 12-day custody of   alias Sadiq, the alleged   operative who was arrested from Indo-Nepal border on Saturday. 

 Sleuths had yet to know whereabouts of the second terror operative   who came along with Naseer from UAE but went missing from Maharajganj on Saturday. Naseer had concealed a Pakistani passport in his socks while crossing the Sahastra Seema Bal checkpost. The passport was found when he was frisked. 
 
 ATS IG Asim Arun said, "We need to find out if he got arrested so he could reach Lucknow jail where more than 12 terrorists are lodged. His assignments are also not known yet," said Arun. Naseer was a native of Ramban in Jammu and Kashmir but moved to Pakistan in 2003 after his name cropped up in terror activities. He was trained by Hizbul Mujahideen and worked under its commander Sayeed Salahudeen. Intelligence agencies have been able to gather so far that Naseer was being sent to the Valley for a mission but was caught. 
 
 Naseer reached Sharjah from where he boarded a flight to Kathmandu and reached on May 10. Sleuths recovered air tickets and other documents which helped them trace the route he took. Shafi was from Kupwara. As the men are from Kashmir, central intelligence agencies and local IB unit are expected to join ATS.
