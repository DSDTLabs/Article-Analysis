HYDERABAD:   government and   ( ) authorities have mutually agreed that the state government will take up the challenging task of constructing entire portion of road over bridges on railway crossings in the state on its own.

 All these years, railways used to construct only part of bridge over railway tracks with state governments executing works on remaining part of the bridge on either side of the tracks. Construction of the bridge over railway tracks needs specialised railway engineering expertise.
 
 
 SCR general manager   and Telangana roads and buildings minister   have come to an understanding that the state government would need to take railways’ approval for designs and structural stability of the bridges over the railway portion. “Taking railway approval is mandatory as safety of passengers is on top of the agenda of railways and state government,” an official said.
 
 A senior official from the roads and buildings department told TOI that Telangana government will hire services of experts in construction and maintenance of railway bridges and also retired railway engineers.
 
 The decision to hand over construction of road over bridges to the state government was taken to avoid delays and put an end to coordination problems between multiple agencies. “Of 460 rail crossings in Telangana, 52 ROBs will be taken up at an estimated cost of ?2700 crore in the first phase. Railways and state government will share the cost of the project 50% each,” the official said. SCR has also given an in-principle nod for four-laning of ROBs as important highways are being expanded to four-lanes.
