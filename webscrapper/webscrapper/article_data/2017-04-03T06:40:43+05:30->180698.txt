Gurgaon: Over two months after they were stationed here from across the country to prepare for another round of   quota protests, the strength of paramilitary forces deployed in the state has been cut to half. With the   in Haryana deferred, and only nine symbolic sit-in sites-cum-offices for leaders of the   (AIJASS) now functional, authorities sense the tension to have reduced, which is why, the strength of the forces has been cut.

 Over 12,000 paramilitary troopers, in addition to over 20,000 cops from the state police force, were deployed across the state since the Jat agitation began on January 29 this year. Of these, over 5,000 paramilitary troops and 7,000 cops were deployed to guard the highways and the border between Delhi and Haryana. But since the March 19 meeting between AIJASS leaders and chief minister  , the protesters are continuing with only symbolic sit-ins at nine locations. Also, sources revealed intelligence reports have confirmed the agitation has subsided for now.
 
 This is why around 5,500 paramilitary troops have now been relieved off their duties. “These include the 5,000 troopers who have been guarding NH-2 (Delhi-Faridabad) and NH-8 (Delhi-Gurgaon). District police has been assigned the duty to ensure law and order on these highways,” said   Sibash Kabiraj, inspector general (highways).
 
 Divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners, several of whom were submitting a written daily report to the state government as part of the exercise, will no longer be required to do so. Similarly, district police chiefs, including police commissioners and superintendents who were also reporting thrice daily, are now required to do it only twice.
