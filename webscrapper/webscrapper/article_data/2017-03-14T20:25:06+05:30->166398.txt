AGRA: A report by the   (CAG) has revealed that excess liquor was withdrawn from   (URCs) and was allegedly being illegally sold in open market.

 Out of 35 URCs, 20 had drawn over Rs 5.16 crore worth 5,14,369 liquor bottles in excess of their entitlement from November 2013 to January 2016.
 
 URCs are run by Regimental Units from non-public funds and are the interface between CSD and consumers.
 
 Based on the audit, CAG hinted that there was a strong possibility that the excess drawn liquor could be illegally sold in the open market or to unauthorised persons.
 
 According to CAG, “During the performance audit of CSD carried out in 2008-09, excess drawal of liquor by the URCs was observed, after which MoD submitted a report to parliamentary action committee (PAC) in December 2011, stating the measures taken to control the illegal sale. However, in spite of such assurances, cases of excess drawal continued.”
 
 Citing complaint of illegal   in the civil market, CAG claimed,”A Court of Inquiry found that 1,55,502 units of liquor were drawn in excess of entitlement and out of this 97,432 units was sold to unauthorized personnel during February to April 2011 in Delhi.”
 
 CAG also claimed, “URCs were obtaining the liquor license from excise department based on the posted strength of the service personnel, but a copy of such permit was not available with the CSD depots to establish their genuineness.”
 
 In response to the  , the CSD Directorate assured that “Necessary instructions would be issued to all concerned HQs and URCs. In addition, the liquor license may be taken on the basis of actual posting and not on the sanctioned strength.”
