CHENNAI: As a  ,   has influenced many artists over the years, in   Now, Chennai-based software engineer-artist  , is going a step ahead, planning to draw 13 important scenes from the famous play 'Duryodhanavadham' on large canvases.

 Each 6ft canvas will represent important scenes of the play that starts from the `thiranokku' of Duryodhana to the killing of Dushasana. A month ago, Sajeesh finished the 11th scene depicting the killing of Dushasana. That would be his first work in the project that may take at least five years to complete.
 
 “I want to contribute a healthy and aesthetic life to so ciety through colorful strokes. Every finished work of mine aims at portraying a long-forgotten culture and tradition. I have taken Kathakali because it is a vibrant art form. Painting is generally a form of communication and I found it's the best medium through which we can express our feelings and thoughts to society,“ he said.
 
 Written by Vayaskara Moossatu, `Duryodhanavad ham' is of the Mahabharata's main parts. Pathinjapadam, Thiranokku, Choothu, Vasthrakshepam, Doothu and Viswaroopam are some of the important scenes Sajeesh plans to finish next. Of these 13 scenes, “choothu“ (gambling) scene will be the most difficult. “I have to accommodate eight characters with various minute expressions and emotions in a 14ftwide and 10ft-high canvas. It's challenging,“ he said.
 
 `Killing of Dushasana' re cently won a merit award from Bengaluru-based Prafulla Dahanukar Art Foundation. “Recognition is always good, but my aim is to complete the project. I want to conduct an exhibition of all the 13 works in Paris or the US.The art form should reach more people,“ said Sajeesh.
