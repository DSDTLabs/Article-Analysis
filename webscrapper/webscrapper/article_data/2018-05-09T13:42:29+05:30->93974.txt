SALEM: Stanley Reservoir is filling fast, thanks to the continuous rain in its catchment areas in   since Monday. According to officials, the water inflow to the reservoir has seen a steady rise in the past two days.

 “The inflow to the dam has gone up by 1,449 cubic feet per second (cusecs) from 512 cusecs,” a senior   (PWD) official told TOI. According to him, the inflow started increasing from Monday evening following the heavy rainfall near   in the neighbouring state.
 
 The water inflow to the dam was less than 500 cusecs on Monday morning. It rose to 512 cusecs on the same evening.
 
 The water level in the dam, meanwhile, stood at 34.77ft on Tuesday morning. PWD officials said the water level would increase further if the heavy rain continues to lash the catchment areas.
 
 “The water level will cross 40ft before month-end,” the official said.
