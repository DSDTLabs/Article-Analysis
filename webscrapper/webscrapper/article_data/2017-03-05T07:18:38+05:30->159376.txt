NEW DELHI: Former   director A P   is likely to be booked under the stringent Prevention of   Act (PMLA) and may soon face attachment of his properties by the   on alleged money laundering charges. The charges stem from his involvement with controversial meat exporter Moin Qureshi.

 In a separate money laundering case registered against him, the meat exporter has already been questioned by the ED on his dealings with the former CBI director and some other public servants. A senior ED official said the agency is in the process of registering a case under PMLA based on “concrete evidence” against Singh who has already been booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act by the CBI in February last week. Singh headed CBI from 2010 to 2012.
 
 A team of CBI officials had raided Singh’s premises, besides those of two other individuals including a Hyderabad-based businessman and co-accused Moin Qureshi, on February 20. The action followed a communication from ED that a probe has been initiated against the former CBI chief. ED director Karnal Singh had last year written to CBI requesting registration of a case against Singh for his “dealings” with Qureshi.
 
 A separate case against the former CBI chief would help the agency attach his properties and later confiscate them on approval of the adjudicating authorities.
