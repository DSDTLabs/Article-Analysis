If you do things in a loop, you are definitely getting old. Only last year, crafty kaku   was forced to give credit to   for  , sequel to his successful Bong Connection, after he developed a full-blown story out of Joy’s one-liner and pitched it to the Dhanukas. And Dutt’s in repeat mode. I hear he had bounced off the story of his recently announced film, Finally Bhalobasha with the tagline ‘Hormones run faster than emotions’, with producer   before selling it to another production house. This after Pavan had given his nod to the film in a jiffy. Now they claim that there’s no bhalobasha lost between both, as Dutt is avoiding Pavan. More often than not, hormones do run faster than emotions.
