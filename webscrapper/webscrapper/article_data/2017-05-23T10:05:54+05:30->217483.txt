PANAJI:   levels in the five major reservoirs of the state have fallen further, with four of them storing water less than half their capacity. The storage levels may be low, but the safety mark is yet to be breached and the water resources department maintains that there is adequate backup. The current volume is expected to suffice the state’s   till the monsoon showers start from June onwards. 

 Data provided by WRD officials shows that the present reservoir level at Selaulim dam on Monday was 30.75 metres, holding 5,557.20 hectare metre (HAM) water. It’s safety level has been set at 20.42m. The reservoir is built to store 23,436 HAM water.
 
  Similarly, water levels at Anjunem dam are at 74.59m, holding 843 HAM water. The reservoir is capable of storing 4,483 HAM. Panchwadi dam’s levels have fallen to 21.09m, holding just 164 HAM of water against its full capacity of 4,470 HAM. 
 
 Despite the receding levels, officials have said that there’s nothing to panic about. 
 
 “The levels are still above the safety mark. Even if that is crossed, we have provisions for dead storage situations. There are other sources as well from where we can draw water ,” a senior WRD official said. 
 
 Previous years’ water levels of the five major reservoirs are similar to the water levels recorded during this period in the last two years.
