Most sec tribution. Most second-year residents, from January to June, are directly responsible for daily patient care. They also have to teach first year students and balance work and academics, found the study by MBBS student   which was guided by Dr  , head of department of psychiatry.
 
 Beside this, doctors working in clinical branches were facing more stress, depression and anxiety than their counterparts in non-clinical work. The prevalence of depression in lence of depression in clinical work was 29.8% and 20.38% in non-clinical work. The percentage of stress in clinical work was 26.74% and 15.33% in non-clinical work but this difference is not statistically significant.
 
 Similarly, 35.81% of junior doctors in surgical work were in depression against 25.59% in non-surgical work. Doctors who worked more than 12 hours were also at risk of depression, stress or anxiety. The study found that resident doctors who perceived their departments as strict and felt less job satisfaction were at a higher risk for depression, anxiety and stress.
