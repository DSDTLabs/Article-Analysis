NEW DELHI: When the   and   did not turn up for a   on   on Tuesday, the education minister took   at them. 

 Comparing certain officer unions as the patriarchal mothers-in-law who keep their daughters-in-law from coming before their fathers-in-law, Manish   said it’s not the work of the directorate officers but a certain section of the bureaucracy that’s keeping officers from reporting to work. 
 
 “There is a fear of the mother-in-law in orthodox traditions. And if the mother-in-law says that the father-in-law is coming home, the daughter-in-law doesn’t show her face. Our department has a similar situation these days. Some unions have put themselves in place of the mother-in-law and warned them against turning up in front of the minister,” Sisodia said in Hindi. 
 
 “Nobody asks the daughter-in-law or the father-in-law, but just that the mother-in-law has issued a diktat,” he added. 
 
 The seminar was organised by State Council for Educational Research and Training, with paper presentations by teachers of the directorate of education and other institutions across the country. The seminar was being planned for several months by SCERT and the education department. The keynote address was delivered by Sonam Wangchuk, an engineer and education reformist from Ladakh.
