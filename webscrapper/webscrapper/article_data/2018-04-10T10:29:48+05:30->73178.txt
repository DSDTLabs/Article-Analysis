CHENNAI: The   returns to Chennai after two years on Tuesday with   taking on Kolkata Knight Riders and the franchise has left no stone unturned to make it a smooth occasion despite the air of uncertainty over the   issue.

 
 "The matches at Chepauk are on and we have got the assurance from the state government that we will get enough security," Chennai Super Kings CEO Kasi Viswanathan told TOI. The city police, too, in a release issued on Monday, said that there will be four-layered security cover for the stadium. At least 2,000 police personnel including 13 deputy commissioners, seven additional deputy commissioners, 29 assistant commissioners and 100 inspectors will be at work.
 
 On Sunday, superstar   had asked the   team to wear black armbands protesting Centre's decision not to form the Cauvery Management Board. But while the CSK authorities chose to play it safe saying they "won't make a statement on the issue", the police said that fans should not wear black or carry any black-coloured material or cloth with them to the ground. "Our security cover will ensure that ticket holders who come clad in black clothes will not be given entry into the ground. We do not want to take any risk regarding security of our spectators and everyone involved in the game," said a police official.
 
 The city police has also decided to cordon off Wallajah Road from Triplicane police station to keep things under control near the venue. "Commando force personnel, swift action group and rapid action force personnel will also be kept ready for any emergency," an officer said.
 
 While the state government and the CSK management are doing their best to ensure a smooth conduct of the matches, the  , on its part, made it clear that they want the games scheduled for the city to go on without any hiccups.
