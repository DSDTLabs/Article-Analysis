MYSURU: The   is fielding   in   assembly constituency for the second time. The 53-year-old Nagendra started his political career in 1993 and is a three-time corporator. He served as the president of the state BJP’s Slum Morcha. During the BJP government, he was made the   chairman as the post was vacant for three years after JD(S) leader Sa Ra Mahesh relinquished the office. 

 In 2013, he secured around 27,000 votes. He was given the BJP ticket after sitting MLA H S Shankaralingegowda, who was elected from Chamaraja for four consecutive terms, quit the party just two months before the elections and joined the JD(S). Shankaralingegowda was upset after being denied ministerial position in the state BJP government. It was, however, Congress candidate Vasu who won the election.
 
 
  
 
 Excerpts from an interview with Nagendra:
 
 
 
 
 There is good response from the public. People still remember the development works which I carried out as a corporator for three consecutive times and as MUDA chairman. I’m making all efforts and I’m confident of winning the election with a huge margin.
 
 
 
 
 The campaign by PM Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah was a great success in Mysuru. I believe that my votes will rise by 5% after these leaders’ visit. During door-to-door campaign, I see people watching television programmes of PM Modi. This shows how people are influenced by Modi and the programmes initiated in the country.
 
 
 
 The BJP government at the Centre and B S Yeddyurappa’s government (when it was in power in the state) have given a lot of welfare programmes to Mysuru and the segment. It was during the BJP government that Dasara was declared as “Naada Habba”. Modi released Rs 7,360 crore for the development of Bengaluru and Mysuru and Rs 178 crore for Amrut Yojana.
