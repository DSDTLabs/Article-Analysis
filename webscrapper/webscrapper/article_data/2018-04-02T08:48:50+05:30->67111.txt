GURUGRAM: Parts of Delhi and   are likely to receive light rainfall and thunderstorms on April 3 as a result of a western disturbance approaching northern parts of the country, according to Regional   Forecasting Centre (RWFC) officials. 

 Officials, however, added that there won’t be much respite from the heat. Mercury is expected to go up to 37-38 degrees Celsius by the end of this week. While skies will remain clear on Monday, on Tuesday, they will remain mostly or partly cloudy the days after.
 
 “We are not expecting any significant rainfall, although the city is likely to witness thunder and lightening,” said a senior RWFC official. “Two developments are responsible for this. Firstly, a change in wind direction is imminent. We are currently receiving easterly winds, which will gradually give way to north-westerly winds. Secondly,a western disturbance is heading towards northern parts of India like Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Both these developments will trigger cloudy conditions, lightening and thunderstorms across different parts of NCR on Tuesday,” he added.
 
 Officials, however, said a respite from the rising temperatures is not likely. The maximum   at Palam observatory reportedly touched 40 degrees Celsius on March 28 — the highest at this time in eight years.
 
 Officials said that the upward trend of mercury will continue. “By the end of this week, we will have maximum temperatures hovering within the range of 37 – 38 degrees,” an official said. Minimum temperatures are also likely to reflect an upward trend now, making the nights comparatively warmer.
 
 On Sunday, the maximum temperature in Gurugram touched 35 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature was recorded as 20 degrees.
