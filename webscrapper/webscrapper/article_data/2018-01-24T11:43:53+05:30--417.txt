When the episode starts we see Neil rushing off with a trolley in hand. Ballu catches him. In the prison, Jailer asks Avni to clean up the cabin before dinner. Gurumaa calls Ballu and enquires about Neela when she comes to know that Neil, who was in disguise, has fled off with Neela and Mishti. 

 The jailer then confronts Avni and threatens her to put her in a solitary confinement and tells the authorities that Avni tried to escape again. Avni pleads for help. Mausi doubts that somebody has tried to frame Avni falsely. Tara and Sitara also believe Avni and fight for her.
 
 The card falls down. Mausi bends down to pick it up but falls. In a quick span, Avni informs Sunehri that Neela and Mishti aren't safe and she should inform DD. Avni is confined to a dark cell.
 
 
  
 Neil, Neela, and Mishti are stopped midway when goons attack. Ballu aks Neil to come out of the car. We see Vidyut enter the scene.
 
 Neil and Vidyut break into a fight. Vidyut goes to Mishti, who doesn't want to hug her. Neil tells him that she doesn't want a father like Vidyut who then points a gun at him. Neil and Vidyut agree to fight it out alone. They both get injured in the fight.
 
 Sunehri pleads with Avni to run away but she ignores. She says she promised Neil that she would find a right way soon.
