NOIDA: Eldeco Aamantran in Noida’s Sector 119, which houses around 500 residents, had no power for over seven hours on Thursday after the cable box of the power line got burnt due to overheating.

 Power was cut off in the residential society at 6.50am and supply was resumed for some time at 1.45pm. “We woke up to the beep of the power backup, and thought power supply would return in a few minutes. As the weather is still cold there is not much pressure on supply. We had to rely on backup for nearly the entire first half of the day. The power backup comes with high costs, and it’s not even summer,” said a resident of tower MP-1. 
 
 A direct line from the substation in Sector 115 supplies power to the society. When contacted, sub-divisional officer Rahul Pandey maintained that the cable box got burnt because of some internal fault. “We tried to fix it and supply was resumed by 4.35pm,” Pandey said.
 
 According to Mukul Singhal, PVVNL superintending engineer, it’s normal for a cable box to suffer some wear and tear and maintenance work takes some time to be fixed, which is why the long outage took place.
