MELBOURNE: The focus was on  's abbreviated service motion. The locked elbow, the missing swing and the sharp snap of his wrist that saw him send down four aces in his first competitive match in six months. The Serb, six-time   titlist, beat American   6-1, 6-2, 6-4 in one hour and 51 minutes in the first round, demonstrating that he can still sting.

 "I'm happy with the second serve, it was good. First serve was kind of up and down," he said. "When you come back after a long time, obviously things are a bit exaggerated. All in all, I'm quite pleased. I know that it's going to take a little bit of time for me to work my way in and get used to the changes that I've made in my service motion."
 
 Djokovic's serve looked way better in the match than it had in practice, smoother and fuller, even without the full rotation. "I was also dealing with nerves in this comeback game. I had various emotions, mostly good ones, excitement, joy, gratitude for being able to have an opportunity to compete. About three weeks ago, I didn't know whether I'm going to play Australia or not," he said of the storm within.
 
 "I was looking forward to get out on the court and compete. I did feel nerves and I did feel a bit skeptical whether I'm going to be able to continue playing well as I have the last couple weeks in practice sessions. But I thought I controlled it well."
 
 Just before the 30-year-old Serb walked onto the Margaret Court Arena, he was seen giving a patient ear to his superstar coach Andre Agassi, with his second coach the cerebral Czech  , standing close, while his trainer pulled on a skin-coloured sleeve on his right hand. Djokovic also appeared a tad heavier. He was apparently directed by Agassi to put on some extra pounds, which showed every time he pulled up his tee to wipe his face, but more importantly in the weight of shot and serve as he belted 33 winners.
 
 Ninth-seeded Swiss Stan Wawrinka, who underwent knee surgery last year, also missing six months of action, battled through the pain to put out Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis 6-3, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-2).
