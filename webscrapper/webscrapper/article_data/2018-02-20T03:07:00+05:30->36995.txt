Visakhapatnam: A team of officials from Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (Vuda), which recently wrapped up a two-week study tour of developmental projects across several cities in the country, has preliminarily handpicked a few projects that can be replicated back home in   limits.

 Some of the projects include a futuristic underground parking facility in the city along the lines of a similar one in Jaipur, a ‘food bazaar’ that will highlight unique delicacies of the state, development of an outer ring road in Srikakulam, and developing town planning schemes for urban pockets within the limits of the proposed Visakhapatnam Metro Region Development Authority (VMRDA).
 
 Vuda will also work on a strategy to transform its 800-acre land on Yarada hill into an integreated tourism project that will have a botanical garden, golf course, club house, and resorts.
 
 The heads of eight urban bodies in the state, including from Vuda, had gone on a study tour in January to observe best practices in urban planning and development implemented in cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, and Noida among others.
 
 Vuda vice-chairman P Basanth Kumar, who led the delegation, said they gave a powerpoint presentation to chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and municipal administration and urban development minister P Narayana. 
 
 “The chief minister has directed us to prepare an action plan in the next one month on how we can adapt these best practices in Vuda limits. Even though no feasibility reports were prepared, we have zeroed in on some projects from these cities which can be implemented in Vuda limits,” Basanth Kumar said.
 
 Basanth Kumar was all praise for the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority’s (AUDA’s) 128 development plans with focussed development on certain sectors.
