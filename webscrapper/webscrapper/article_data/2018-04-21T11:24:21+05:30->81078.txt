CHANDIGARH: As many as 151 residents of Sector 38 (west) have objected to the communication from their area councillor   to see him at his place for verification of membership forms of the   of their area. According to them, if required, the   staff should visit them to verify the same.

 On Thursday, these residents received a letter from their area councillor in which he stated that he has received application forms seeking community centre memberships. He stated that somebody might have collected those from the residents by claiming to get them memberships of the sector’s community centre.
 
 He added that as per latest bylaws no such person is authorised to collect membership fees from the residents. The forms can be verified by elected area councillors only and deposit with the caretaker of the community centre. The councillor asked the residents to visit his home with self-attested photocopy of their addressproofs.
 
 Pankaj Gupta, president of resident welfare association, Sector 38 (west), said the residents have an objection to the councillor wanting them to visit his house for the verification when actually the MC staff is supposed to do the same. “As the forms submitted by the residents are self-attested, I don’t think there is any need for the residents to visit him for the verification.”
 
 
 
 
 I have received application forms from the MC commissioner’s office. After this, I have sent a communication to all the concerned residents so that they can get these forms verified by me. This is the norm of the corporation. I have also specifically mentioned the time to visit me in the letter, so that the residents can plan accordingly. I have also decided to be present at the community centre on Saturdays and Sundays for the same.
