 The 27-year-old woman and her husband had been running from the pillar to post for the treatment of their only son, a six-year-old who is suffering from leukemia. Her husband works as a manager at a factory in Kolkata. The duo had spent their savings on the boy's treatment with no or little improvement.
 
 Around four months ago, their neighbour in Howrah's Joypur asked them to take the boy to the ayurveda practitioner who had “miracle potions“ for different ailment. Accor plessness, Kuttus kept a condition that shocked her. “Kuttus assured me that he would cure my son in six months. But, he told me that he could waive the fees if I agreed to have sex with him for the next six months," the woman alleged in her FIR.
 
 Worried about her son's he dingly, the couple knocked on the doors of the practitioner who runs a chamber in Amta, off National Highway 6. “The ayurved said he would cure my son with some herb that would cost Rs 5 to 6 lakh,"said the woman's husband. When the couple pleaded to make the treatment affordable, Kuttus asked them to visit another day .
 
 With no idea about his sinister motive, the woman went alone to his chamber. Taking advantage of the woman's hel alth, she reportedly agreed and let Kuttus have his way for the past three months. Kuttus would exploit her at his chamber whenever she would go there with her son.
 
 But things turned worse on Saturday , as Kuttus asked her to entertain more men, saying some of his friends were turning up at his chamber. When the woman refused, the accused allegedly assaulted her. Hearing the woman's cry for help, locals reached the spot, beat up Kuttus and called police.
 
 “We have booked Kuttus under sections 376 and 506 IPC.He will be interrogated soon,“ said Howrah
