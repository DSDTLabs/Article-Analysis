VIJAYAWADA: The body of 25-year-old techie Govindu Nagasai, who went missing on April 8, was found in the   barrage here on Monday evening. 

 Police confirmed that Nagasai committed suicide, but didn't specify reasons for his extreme step. The suicide remained a mystery even for the Nagasai's family.
 
 Nagasai, who worked for Canadian   (CGIT) in   in Hyderabad, hailed from Vijayawada.
 
 Since last one month, he had been working from home in   on the outskirts of Vijayawada. Nagasai was last seen by his family at around 3 pm in his house. He sent a text message to his brother, saying: "I am going to my dreamland, bye bye." Nagasai's father Govindu Nageswara Rao told TOI on Sunday that "neither Nagasai was the type of a person to commit suicide nor he was mentally unstable. Everything was fine till we last saw him. We suspect that there could be something wrong at his workplace as he barely spoke about it." 
 
 In fact, police realised during searches that he had been active on his cellphone and facebook till Sunday night. He first informed his family through WhatsApp to collect his scooter from Durga ghat and the father even recovered the vehicle from there.
