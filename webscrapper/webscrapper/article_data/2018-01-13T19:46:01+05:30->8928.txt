The fest season on campus has begun. It started with the inaugural ceremony of Symphony, the annual cultural festival of   (JDMC). The highlight of the first day was Munadi, the annual street play competition organized by Anubhuti, the street play society of the college. While some colleges chose topical themes, others chose to show the round-up of 2017. There were some offbeat topics like emotional hygiene and issues as relatable as body shaming were also presented through the plays at the competition.

 Abhinay, the dramatics society of Maharaja Agrasen College, presented Ek (Terms And Conditions Applied), its annual street production focusing on five aspects mainly separatism, secession, nationalism, ignorance and child soldiers. "We chose this theme because nobody was talking about these in DU’s theatre circuit. And we wanted to show that these five aspects are really important. We gave examples of Kashmir for separatism, Telangana for secession to support our theme. In one of the scenes, we talked about P Chidambaram's statement when he said that Kashmir deserves greater autonomy. He had definitely faced a backlash, but the way his statement was used by the media was something that we highlighted in our play. Another issue that we have highlighted in our play is child soldiers. We compared their childhood to a normal kid's," said Shashwat Gupta, a member of the society.

 Rahnuma, the dramatics society of Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women performed The Lost Clown at the competition. Ditching the usual kurtas for street plays, members of the society dressed as clowns. They chose emotional hygiene as their theme, contrasting it with the lives of clowns who are expected to laugh all the time. It was highly appreciated by the audience. "People take serious themes like nationalism, politics and what not. But we wanted to show everyone that this is important for all of us. One of our team members came up with the idea of doing a play on this theme. Emotional hygiene is to be aware of our anxiety, trauma or emotional despair and treating it the right way. Our play shows a contrast between a normal office-going person and a clown who is expected to make people laugh all the time, As he loses the capability to make others laugh, he is made to leave the profession because he isn’t funny anymore. But nobody, realizes the emotional pain that he is going through, not even he himself. Through our play, we want students to accept the way they are and talk to others if they feel something is bothering them," explained Nipun Soni, Vice President of the society.

 The dramatics society of Lady Shri Ram College for Women presented The Trial Room, its annual street production. The play focused on body shaming and they also targeted the fairness cream advertisements that give false hopes to consumers. In the first scene of the play, a member of the society removed her kurta to show the comments that girls as well as guys face if they do not meet the criteria of being 'beautiful' and 'handsome'. "We are sure that there are other extremely relevant issues, but this topic was something that was more close to us. We showed two issues mainly, one was body shaming and the other was how people expect you to be a specific body type; how fairness creams show that a person can get a job on the basis of their fair skin, and not based on someone’s capabilities, how the society questions your masculinity and femininity. Through our play, we wanted to show that it is very important for people to accept the way they are," said  , one of the directors of the play.
