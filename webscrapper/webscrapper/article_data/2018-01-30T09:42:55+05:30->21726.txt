CHANDIGARH: A private company or any government agency should pay   for taking people’s data for a study or other purposes to curb the practice of unnecessary  , suggested Dr N S  , additional chief secretary, development,  .

 Kalsi made the recommendation during a workshop on the study of Justice B N Srikrishna Committee paper on data protection from a national security perspective held at   (PEC) in collaboration with The Times of India on Monday.
 
 
  
 
 Various speakers raised the issue, pointing out it had become a practice among agencies to collect data of citizens without any specific reason, increasing the risk of data breach that can expose people to grave dangers.
 
 Kalsi suggested the Central government should come up with a policy that as and when any company or agency collects data, they have to pay tax to the government. “The company should fill a form stating the purpose for collecting the data, where it will be saved, who all can access it and how it is going to be utilised,” he said.
 
 P C   former director,  , and member, National Security Advisory Board, suggested the tax imposition will discourage companies from going on data collection spree without setting any goals.
 
 Panellists, who were part of the discussion, agreed to the proposal saying if the tax is imposed, many firms and agencies will not collect data of no use to them and prefer to utilise that which is already in public domain. The control of the government on data collection through taxation will also secure data storage with the companies, as the higher authorities will monitor its security, the panellists recommended.
