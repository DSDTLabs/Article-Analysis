PATNA: The All India Road Transport Workers’ Association (Bihar unit) and   have decided to increase  , city bus and mini bus fares across the state by 20% from April 1. The state transport department, however, is yet to clear the proposal.

 Members of the two associations met state transport commissioner   on March 20 and demanded an immediate increase in fares.
 
 All India Road Transport Workers’ Association (Bihar unit) general secretary   said a final decision in this regard would be taken by the transport department.
 
 “According to Motor Vehicles Act, transport department has the right to bring changes in fare. As far as diesel or fuel prices are concerned, the change is decided by the central government. However, syndicates are now increasing fuel prices. What we pay in the morning for diesel is different from the price paid in the evening. Also there has been a sharp increase in fuel prices in the past three years. Diesel, which was available for Rs 51.33 per litre in 2015, is now available at Rs 68.57. Hence, we should be allowed to increase autorickshaw and bus fares,”   said.
 
 He added hike in prices of tyre, battery and other parts of a vehicle, increase in road tax, jump in registration cost as well as increase in insurance premium and cost of consumer goods also necessitated the fare hike.
 
 Jha said a fare assessment committee headed by transport commissioner reviews the fare. “The government should either allow us to increase the fares from April 1 onwards or permit us not to ply vehicles until a final decision is not taken”, Jha added Jha. 
 
 Transport commissioner Anupam Kumar did not respond to queries raised by this reporter.
