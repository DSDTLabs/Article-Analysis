VIJAYAWADA: Agiripalle police busted a nine-member cricket   racket at   - a sleepy village in Krishna district - on Tuesday night.

 
 The punters were betting on the   match between   and Sunrisers Hyderabad.
 
 Upon getting a tip-off over the betting activity, Agiripalle sub-inspector V Yesobu along with his team raided a house belonging to one Vallabhaneni Haribabu. The police found eight others in the house conducting betting on the IPL match and seized Rs 3.28 cash, nine mobile phones, four bikes and a TV from them. While Haribabu was the organiser of the racket, others were punters who placed bets on the match.
 
 The cops also identified that Haribabu was conducting betting by leasing a ‘dedicated betting line’ from one Purna, a native of Vijayawada. While Purna acts as the main bookie in the racket, Haribabu runs a local racket with interested punters from nearby areas. Haribabu takes the bets based on instructions from Purna who updates the odds.
 
 Police said betting rackets continue despite awareness programmes conducted by police.
