 After the stupendous success of the film, Gautham had confirmed that a sequel is on the cards. But the project never took off and Menon got busy with other commitments. Nearly after 17 years, the director is all set to reunite with his ‘Minnale’ star   for ‘Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya 2’, in which he will essay Karthik’s role played by Simbu. 
 
 In a recent interview, Gautham said that the story will take place eight years after where the first part ended. If reports are to go by, ‘VTV 2’ is about Karthik and his three friends from Bangalore, Hyderabad and Trivandrum. 
 
 Reports suggest that the sequel will be a multi-starrer featuring leading actors from all the southern states. The film is likely to have music by AR Rahman. On the work front, Menon is currently wrapping up ‘Dhruva Natchathiram’ with Vikram. Touted to be an action-thriller, the film is likely to release later this year.
