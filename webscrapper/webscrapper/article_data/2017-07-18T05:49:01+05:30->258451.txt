AHMEDABAD: At least 380 cases of vector-borne infections, mainly malaria caused by  , were reported in Ahmedabad in the first fortnight of July. 

 Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s weekly health report released on Monday, stated that there were 369 cases of malaria, three of falciparum and one case of chikungunya, in the first fortnight of July at hospitals run by the civic body.
 
  “The number of cases indicate a downward trend and are in line with those seen in June. We have intensified activities to curb mosquito breeding. Some 300 additional workers have been hired for fogging,” said  , in-charge medical officer of AMC’s health department.
 
 From June 1 to July 15, more than 1,200 cases of vector-borne infections have been reported. Come August, the number of cases may increase sharply, as intermittent rainfall this month will create conducive conditions for mosquito breeding. 
 
 Dr V K Kohli, assistant entomologist with the AMC said, “As mosquito breeding will increase, mosquito density (i.e. the number of mosquitoes per room) will rise and it is therefore likely that the number of cases will rise too. Citizens must be extra careful and exercise caution to not only prevent infection but also to curb mosquito breeding.”
 
 General practitioners have already begun reporting cases of vector-borne infections, particularly malaria. “The number of malaria cases is particularly high, with four or five   being admitted to our hospital every day. While there are no major complications related to the malaria cases, a spike in vector-borne infections is likely in the days to come,” said  , head of the medicine department at BJ Medical College.
