INDORE: The district collector has no authority to pass guidelines regulating private schools in the city, the Indore bench of high court has said while allowing a petition moved by private CBSE schools of the city. 

 The guidelines by the collector which were challenged by the petitioner have been quashed through the order passed by a division bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice  . 
 
 The petition had been moved by the   through   against the collector’s guidelines dated July 22, 2015. 
 
 The court has also directed the state guidelines regarding similar issues to be kept in abeyance as there is no legal backing for passing such guidelines. 
 
 “We had submitted that the collector does not have any power to frame guidelines in respect of private schools either affiliated with CBSE or MP Board,”  , petitioner’s counsel said. 
 
 The schools had also stated before the court that under the garb of the guidelines, an attempt was being made to bring all the private schools under the administrative control of the collector, even though the collector is not the competent authority under the regulations framed by CBSE or state government.
 
 The court while disposing the petition accepted the petitioner’s contentions and quashed the district collector’s guidelines. 
 
 The state government had also issued similar guidelines to ensure the private schools do not charge exorbitant fees from students.
 
 Two separate petitions had been filed by the schools’ association, which had been clubbed for analogous hearings by the court. Both the petitions were disposed by the court on April 11.
