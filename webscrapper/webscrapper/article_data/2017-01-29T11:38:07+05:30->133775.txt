PUNE: Unidentified thieves took advantage of the absence of security guards and working CCTV cameras to break into seven shops in a small shopping complex at Bibvewadi on the night intervening Friday and Saturday, raising concerns about rising crimes in the city.

 The burglaries came to light on Saturday morning when the shop owners in Purple Plaza Commercial Complex at   found the shutter locks of their establishments missing and the doors bent open.
 
 Medical practitioner   (42) of Bibvewadi lodged a complaint with the   police station on Saturday. Awari told police that his wife runs a clinic in the complex which remains open between 10am and 10pm.
 
 She shut down the clinic as usual around 10pm and reached home. When she went to the clinic the next morning, she realized that Rs 300 in cash and a digital video recorder (DVR) of the closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras worth Rs 10,000 were stolen.
 
 The burglars broke-open a neighbouring laboratory and stole Rs 3,400 in cash, while another shopowner informed the police that the thieves took around Rs 700, all in loose coins from his shop. A video parlour operator said the suspects stole Rs 2,000 in cash from his establishment.
 
 The suspects did not find anything valuable in the other shops, which they broke open.
 
 Bibvewadi police said, “After spotting CCTV cameras installed at the clinic, the suspects took away the DVR.”
 
  senior inspector of Bharati Vidyapeeth police station told TOI the DVR, which the thieves took was non-functioning. “The other CCTV cameras and DVRs installed in the commercial complex are also not functional, as such, no footage of the break-in is available. The society and commercial complex members had not even hired security guards to keep a watch on their properties,” Gaikwad said.
