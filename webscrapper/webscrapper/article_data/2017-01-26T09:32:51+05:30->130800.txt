AURANGABAD: Shri  , a registered charity organisation that manages the famous   here, has decided to start a public meal facility at nominal price soon. 

 Addressing media persons here on Wednesday, Chandrakant Mule, chairman of the sabha, said the service aims to help students and relatives of patients, besides other needy persons.
 
 “The area in which our temple is located houses several hospitals and relatives of patients admitted in these hospitals often find it difficult to get proper food. Also, the city is home to many outstation students and many of them do not get quality meal two times a day due to lack of money. These people, along with others, will benefit from the move,” he said.
 
 Manoj Padalkar, secretary of the organisation, said, “We will run the meal facility on no-profit no-loss basis. We will charge nominal rate so that we can manage the expenses.” 
 
 Trustees of the Ganesh Sabja also announced that they were contemplating to start a health centre and a reading room for students in near future. Established in 1971, the sabha completed construction of the temple in 1981.
 
 It has also announced a range of programmes to celebrate  , falling on January 31. The celebrations will begin from January 28 with Ganesh ‘mahayag’. On January 31, a ‘keertan’ programme will be conducted, along with ‘mahaprasad’, said Prakarsh Pinge, treasurer of the sabha.
