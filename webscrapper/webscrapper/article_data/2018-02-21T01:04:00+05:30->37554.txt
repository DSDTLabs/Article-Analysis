Tuticorin: Tense moments prevailed here as a clash broke between the police and a section of the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) cadre at the party’s Red Flag rally here on Tuesday. It is learnt that around 10 people including a few police personnel were injured in the incident that took place in the evening.

 Thousands of cadre participated in the rally that was organised on the final day of the 22nd state level conference of CPM, which was flagged off by the party’s national secretary Sitaram Yechury. As the tail end of the rally was nearing Anna Nagar Main Junction, police tried to regulate the rallyists who had occupied the entire stretch of the road.
 
 An argument broke out between the cadre and the police led by assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Selva Nagarathinam. It is learnt that a few cadre sprayed water from packets on the police. The latter lost their cool and started attacking the party cadre with wooden logs they gathered from a nearby construction site.
 
 The cadres too retaliated by counter attacking the police with the logs.
