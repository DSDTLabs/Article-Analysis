Keri: After stopping work on the Kalsa project for more than two weeks, Karnataka has started clearing debris near the inspection bungalow in Kankumbi. As soon as the Goa government filed an application before the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal seeking necessary orders against Karnataka for continuing work of the Kalsa project, Karnataka stopped work for the last two weeks. Recently with the slow pace, Karnataka started clearing debris. B G Gurupadaswamy, secretary of Karnataka’s water resources department in his affidavit pertaining to the replies to Goa’s application, mentioned that Karnataka has not carried out any construction work in the non-forest area except maintenance works so that the vents of the Kalsa canal are not damaged by accumulation of silt and debris. Nanda Gaonkar, deputy sarpanch of Kankumbi told TOI, “Presently all the work of the interconnecting canal has been stopped by Karnataka. The machineries involved in the work have been removed from the site and the shed constructed before the office of DRN Infra Company also has been dismantled and very few workers remain.”
