  : Three people were arrested on Sunday for assisting triple murder accused Udyan Das in selling house of his mother   at Sundar Nagar through fraudulent means. 

 The three accused, Suresh Dua, Sandeep Shrivastava and Shankarlal Ratre were produced in the court, following which, they have been sent to jail for 14 days.
 
 According to police, Udayan had prepared a fake death certificate of his mother from Ratlam in   in 2013, which he used to get the house transferred in his name. 
 
 He later issued power of attorney to Suresh Dua and got the house sold off on his mother's behalf.
 
 The power of attorney given to Suresh Dua was an act of fraud in itself as it was prepared and notarised on 19 February 2013, which is one month prior to the ownership of house being actually transferred to Udyan's name on March 19, 2013. The other accused, Sandeep Shrivastava and Shankarlal Ratre were witnesses to the transfer of power of attorney and investigations revealed they were very much aware of the fraud being committed to sell off the house.
