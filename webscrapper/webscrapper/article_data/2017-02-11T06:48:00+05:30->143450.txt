 A date close to March 11 has been issued by  .
 
 Speaking to TOI, Mayor Ashu Verma said, “This project will be extremely cost effective for   and we’re not even spending a penny for it.”
 
 LED lights are greatly energy efficient too. 
 
 “All the formalities like awarding of the contract, deriving NOCs and the state government’s approval, planning work were completed by the end of December itself. Now, only the culmination of elections is awaited,” said D K Sinha, additional municipal commissioner, Ghaziabad.
 
 Verma said that under this scheme, the contract was awarded to White Placard technologies, a Jharkhand-based firm, which will install and replace all the streetlights in the district at their own expense. “Our bill for a year of electricity consumed by streetlights accounts to Rs 16 crore, which will be reduced to 2/3 of it after this project is implemented. This firm will change all the lights in a period of three years and will also take care of their maintenance for seven years, which will save the GMC a lot of money.” 
 
 “However, by the end of that time period, out of all the cost savings 75% of that money will be kept by them and 25% will remain with us,” he added.
 
 The area that will be the first one to witness the change has not been chosen as yet, according to Verma.
