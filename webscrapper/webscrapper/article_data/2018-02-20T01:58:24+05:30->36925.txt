MUMBAI: The Bombay high court (HC) has rejected a petition filed by  's Gilbert Mendonca, challenging the election of   MLA   on the ground that it was presented in court not by him, but his lawyer. Mendonca had lost against Mehta from Mira-Bhayander constituency in the 2014 polls. 

 Justice   on February 9 gave his verdict on Mehta's plea to reject Mendonca's petition for non-compliance of a mandatory provision of the Representation of the People Act, which renders the petition not maintainable. 
 
 Mehta's advocates argued that Mendonca was not present at time of presentation of the petition in the HC's registry and had not attested it to be a "true copy" of the petition.
