Chennai is fast becoming one of the popular fashion destinations in the country, and the fact that several renowned designers, both from India and abroad, are showcasing their designs here is testimony to the fact. Recently, the city saw the launch of yet another designer boutique, which was attended by some of the biggest names in the social circuit.   While director Ameer dropped by to check out the latest collection, Isha, dressed in a floor-length black number, was spotted browsing through the designs. With Vincent Asokan and Tina playing perfect hosts, Meenakshi, Priya, Kiran and Michele and Ron were seen enjoying the evening.
