Ludhiana: Fourteen days after an LPG cylinder exploded at a house in Giaspura, a 28-year-old man succumbed to the burns on Wednesday. 

 Like many of his neighbours, Surinder Kumar, who worked as a labourer at a factory, had rushed to Ashok Yadav’s house as gas leak triggered panic on April 26. But the cylinder exploded, leaving 34, including Surinder, injured. 
 
 The Giaspura resident had received 80% burns. He was undergoing treatment at Christian Medical College and Hospital, where he breathed his last. With this, the death count in the blast incident has climbed to 12. 
 
 Jag Narayan, his father, said, “Surinder’s wife, Seema Rani, is shattered by the news of his death. They had tied the knot three years ago. The incident has destroyed many families, most of which have lost their sole breadwinners. My son had gone to Ashok Yadav’s house to help him, but the blast claimed his life. Now, who will look after us?” 
 
 The blast had claimed the lives of house owner Ashok Yadav, his wife Sunita, son Raj, neighbours Ram Naresh, Shashi, Ashok Kumar, Amarnath, Meena Devi, Pawan Kumar, Kamlesh Giri and Rakesh Kumar.
