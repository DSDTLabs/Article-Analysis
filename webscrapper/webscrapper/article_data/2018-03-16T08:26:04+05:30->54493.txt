 Total 14 cops from   and ATS reached the city early on Thursday. They immediately joined in the investigation and helped Surat DCB with their technical expertise. Despite recovery of closed circuit television ( ) footages from several sources, Surat cops are yet to get any concrete clue.
 
 Investigations revealed that the robbers had fired two rounds on a car in which victim Vijay Miyani, an employee of Glow Star Diamond, had arrived with two other colleagues to deposit the diamonds in Katargam Safe Deposit Vault.
