PATIALA: Two sons of a Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) councillor from Samana town,  , were booked on Tuesday for allegedly molesting a 14-year-old girl.

 They have also been charged with criminal intimidation for threatening the minor on January 9 evening. Police, however, are yet to arrest the duo. Both accused are in their 20s.
 
 In his complaint, the father of the girl alleged that his daughter was returning home from tuition when the accused held her arm and abused her. He alleged that they had been stalking her for the past few days and tried to take advantage of the dark on the day they held her hand.
 
 The SAD councillor,  , has termed it a case of politics, saying that it was registered at the behest of Congress MLA Rajinder Singh Kaka. “This is a clear case of political vendetta. The Congress MLA wanted me to join his party and I refused some time ago. Already, we are fighting two cases in court against the family of a girl who had alleged molestation. My both the sons,   and Gautam Kumar, are married and have children,” he said.
 
 He added that both of them owned own business. “Akali workers have already gathered in Samana. We will soon hold a protest against this," he said.
 
 When contacted, Samana City police station SHO Karnail Singh said the girl and her family had approached them on Monday. “We have registered a case under sections 341 (wrongful restraint), (criminal force outraging woman's modesty), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 509 (words insulting modesty of a woman) of Indian Penal Code and Section 8 (sexual assault) of Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act,” he said.
 
 When contacted, Kaka refuted the claim of getting a case registered against the councillor’s two sons. "I have never even seen this councillor. I just came to know of his sons torturing a family a few days ago and that’s it,” he said.
