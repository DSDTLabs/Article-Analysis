SHILLONG: The   ( ) has demanded action against errant taxi drivers in the city, alleging that many of these cabs refuse to ferry passengers to certain areas within the city and to the East Khasi Hills district. 

 
 
 "They are more interested to get full booking, especially from Iewduh, Mothphran and Khyndailad. This causes inconvenience to the general public, especially women and children," CSWO president Agnes Kharshiing alleged. "There are drivers who charge Rs 250 from passengers who book cabs from Mothpran, Iewduh to Polo. This is clear extortion," she added.
 
 "Permits are given for public transport by the state government to help people commute. If these cabs do not want to travel to the required destination, or are overcharging passengers, then the transport department should take away their permits and give them instead to others who will gladly serve the people," Kharshiing said.
 
 "There are certain maxi cabs which would only take passengers in the evening to   but not pick up anyone who wants to go to Lumshyiap or the adjacent areas. This is because the fare to Mawpat is Rs 20 while that to   is Rs 10. The Maxi cabs are financed by the government and many women are complaining about a particular maxi cab that refuses to take them to the Lum Shyiap area from Mothphran. CSWO, therefore, urges the government to ensure the availability of public transport. The permits of those cabs which do not want to take passengers to destinations of their choice should be immediately seized," she added.
