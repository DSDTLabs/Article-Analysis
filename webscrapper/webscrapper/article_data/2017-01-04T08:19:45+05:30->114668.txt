CHENNAI: Social activist  , who had won the admiration of the Madras high court on numerous occasions for his crusade against corruption, on Tuesday drew its ire for a noisy argument in connection with a   filed by him.

 He was removed from the court for not heeding to the Chief Justice’s appeal to maintain decorum.
 
 Ramaswamy’s PIL alleged that the inspector of police, Teynampet, had threatened and used obscene words against him when he tried to enter the Poes Garden residence of late chief minister   and prayed that the court issue directives to the state government to take stringent action against the police officer.
 
 Pointing out that there were more than 250 police personnel still guarding the residence of the former chief minister and that several roads leading to the residence were heavily barricaded, Ramaswemy wanted the court to direct the authorities concerned to remove the large posse of police along with the encumbering barricades.
 
 The first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice M Sundar then asked Ramaswamy to explain why he had, in the first place, attempted to enter the Poes Garden residence of the former chief minister. It asked if he was a resident of the Poes Garden neighbourhood.
 
 Following this an agitated Ramaswamy raised his voice and started arguing vociferously with the bench. The Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, however, kept his cool and asked the activist-petitioner around half-a-dozen times to speak in an orderly manner, befitting the decorum of the court. But, Ramaswamy refused to relent and continued to put forth his argument. The Chief Justice then said the court was not a place where he could raise his voice, and the bench dismissed the PIL.
 
 An unrepentant Ramaswamy, however, came out of the court hall and continued to shout, following which the Chief Justice directed the court officials and security officers to take him away from the premises.
