Mandya: BJP activists have complained against social activist Prabha Belavangala alleging she had posted sleazy photographs of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath. She is said to have uploaded these photos on a social media platform to tarnish the CM’s image. BJP activists claimed they were hurt by it. Siddarajugowda, a complainant, told TOI some so-called progressive leaders had made it a habit of maligning Hindu activists and religious leaders. “Uploading morphed photos of Yogi Adityanath should be condemned. Social activist Prabha Belavangala, who uploaded these photos, should be severely punished,” Siddarajugowda said, who claimed he had sent an email about it to the Bengaluru cyber crime cell. However, the Bengaluru cyber crime cell said it had not received any such complaint.
