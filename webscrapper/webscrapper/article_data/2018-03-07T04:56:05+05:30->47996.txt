MUMBAI: After   examiners called off their boycott on assessment, the state   has turned the heat on   examiners. The state board’s Mumbai division board has told school and junior college heads not to burden   and moderators with non-assessment work or grant them leave to ensure HSC and SSC results are announced on time.

 In a letter to school and junior college heads, Subhash Borse, in-charge secretary of the board’s Mumbai division, said, “As per high court directives, HSC and SSC results have to be declared on time, hence examiners and moderators must dedicate their time towards assessment. They must not be granted leave during this period and they must not be given any work during this period.”
 
 HSC examiners had until Monday boycotted assessment work, creating panic that it could delay results. The board’s diktat has not gone down well with SSC examiners. “We had not even participated in the boycott. We have been cooperating with the board even though it has not revised assessment remuneration for many years. The board cannot instruct our school heads to not allow us to go on leave,” said Rajesh Pandya, vice-president, Teachers’ Democratic Front.
 
 Assessment work begins on day one of the examinations and teachers are expected to assess 150-300 papers in 10-12 days. Borse clarified, “The letter is only a reminder for schools not to burden teachers with extra work in this crucial period. We obviously will not restrict anyone from taking leave in case of an emergency.”
 
 HSC examiners on Tuesday started assessment but corrections will begin after a day, once meetings of chief moderators are complete.
