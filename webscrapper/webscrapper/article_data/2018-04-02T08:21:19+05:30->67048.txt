These properties, designated enemy property, included land, buildings, firms, shares, bank balance, provident fund, and so on. These properties are administrated by the Custodian of Enemy Property for India. The properties were seized in response to 'enemy' countries failing to compensate Indians whose property was seized or who fled these countries because of the war.

 In the 1966 Tashkent Declaration following the war between India and Pakistan, a clause was included that the two countries would discuss return of property and assets taken over by either side in connection to the conflict.

In India, such properties continue to be under the control of the Custodian of Enemy Property.
 
 
 
 Together, UP and West Bengal have over 80 per cent of these immovable properties. Over 98 per cent of it belongs to Pakistani nationals.
