Nagpur: Three people died while 21 others were injured as three vehicles collided with each other on Monday at the Ridhora phata, on the Hyderabad national highway near Medhshi on the outskirts of Akola. The deceased are identified as Dilip Jadhav (32) from Karanja, Anadeem Anbi (19) and Shakeel Sheikh from Madhya Pradesh.  According to the cops, a speeding luxury bus coming from Mumbai towards Nagpur rammed into a stationed truck parked in front of a dhaba after the bus driver lost control. Following the dash, another mini-truck coming from the same direction collided with the bus. Cleaner of the mini-truck along with a bus passenger died on the spot while another passenger succumbed to injuries while being rushed for medical treatment. Passers-by helped the injured by pulling them out of the damaged vehicles. The magnitude of the collision could be assessed from the fact that the head of the cleaner was decapitated after the accident. Akola cops rushed to the spot as soon as the incident was reported. Cops, with the help of villagers, took the injured to Medhshi and Malegaon. Two people, who were severely injured, were shifted to Nagpur and 19 are receiving treatment in Akola. After sending the injured for medical treatment, cops cleared the traffic by removing the bus and mini-truck with cranes.
