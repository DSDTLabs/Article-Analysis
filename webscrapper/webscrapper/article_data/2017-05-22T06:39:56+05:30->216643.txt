VISAKHAPATNAM:   authorities who had recently installed the biometric   have sworn to get tough with   it and coming late to work. 

 Vice-chancellor professor G  , who made a surprise check at the University administration block on Saturday, was livid with rage when he found a number of employees missing at 10 am.
 
 Nageswara Rao issued a public statement on Saturday stating that strict action would be taken against all erring employees of the university. The administrative block has over 120 employees including the computer section and the vice-chancellor visited the S3 wing, CDC and Computer Centre after 10 am. He also checked the attendance list. 
 
 “If anybody is taking the (biometric) system for granted, we will come down hard on them. People cannot walk in and walk out whenever they please. We will keep a watch on the   and anybody breaking the rules will be punished,” the vice-chancellor said. He, however, refused to divulge the number of violations discovered. 
 
 “It is not just the administrative block. Even professors and lecturers coming in late for their classroom sessions will not be spared. The same rule that applies to students will also be applied to teachers and staff members of the university,” he said.
 
 The vice-chancellor has ordered an enquiry. Earlier, he had done the same with students who were were found lazing around in their hostel rooms instead of attending classes. 
 
 Andhra University will entirely switch to the biometric system in the next academic year.
