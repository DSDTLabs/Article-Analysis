CHENNAI:   spokeswoman   on Tuesday revolted against the party and threatened to team up with the dissident group led by O Panneerselvam. A former TV newsreader, Nirmala walked out of a meeting organised for party spokespersons and platform speakers after she earned the wrath of leaders for saying rebels like   must be brought back to the party and that they were not enemies. 

 Former minister P Valarmathi and party spokesperson C R Saraswathi took objection to her remarks and apparently strongly criticised Nirmala for supporting OPS. "All star platform speakers were asked to come to the party headquarters on Monday at 6pm. We did not know the issue for which we were asked to come," Nirmala told TOI. Soon after the meeting started, minister  , former minister P Valarmathi and others started speaking to the platform speakers about the R K Nagar byelection. 
 
 "When I got a chance to speak, I said we should also include Panneerselvam group as they are not our enemies. Immediately, Saraswathi as well as Valarmathi started abusing me," said Nirmala. Nirmala threatened to walk out of the meeting. "Even as I was leaving, Saraswathi once again used abusive words. I said I will speak to the party leadership and left the meeting," said Nirmala.
