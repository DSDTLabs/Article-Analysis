NAGPUR: Three students from the city —   (13),   (13) and   (12) have returned victorious from the second national aero-modelling championship organized at Shikarwadi, Rajasthan from February 2 to 5. 

 The event was conducted at the private runway owned by Prince of Mewar,  , who is also an aero-modeller. 
 
 The first national championship was conducted in 2016 at Amreli, Gujarat. Patel, a Std VII student from Podar International School, bagged first position in spot landing competition in remote controlled glider event. 
 
 Gedam from K John School at Asoli stood second in the endurance event. In this event, the flyer has to run the motor of the glider for 35 seconds during which it should attain maximum height and then the electric motor is turned off. Radake, also a student of K John School, bagged third position in the same category. 
 
 All three of them are students of Aerovision, an aero-modelling academy in the city, and share a passion for aviation since their childhood. Aero-modelling Association members Laxman Sutar and Lft Col Amit Sharma judged the competition.
 
 The championship had 11 categories. “The participants had to perform various manoeuvres using jet remote. There were about 40 participants this year, of which nearly seven were juniors,” said Rajesh Joshi, aeromodelling instructor of Aerovision, emphasizing that this sport needed more funds and exposure.
 
 “We first practised with a software in order to prepare for the championship. Joshi sir used to monitor our progress. We even made models of planes and gliders,” said Patel, who has been practising since he was eight years old. Expressing his happiness, Gedam’s father Nagesh recalled that his son was also lauded by President Pranab Mukherjee at an event in Jabalpur.
 
 Joshi, who is associated with aero-modelling for the last 31 years, has penned a book on titled ‘The wonders of model aviation.’ It was released at World Book Fair in Delhi in January.
