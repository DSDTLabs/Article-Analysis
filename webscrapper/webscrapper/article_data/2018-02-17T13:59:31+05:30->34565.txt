Tirupur:  , laden with imported sand from  ,  

 The sand, imported through   port, was being taken to Palani in Dindigul district. The trucks were seized as the government has recently banned the direct sale of imported sand. However, the importer was presumed to have obtained permission to import and sell the sand within Kerala.
 
 As per the Tamil Nadu Minor Minerals Concession Rules, 1959, no one should procure sand from the other states and sell them in Tamil Nadu without the permission of the public works department (PWD), which will give nod only if quality of the sand satisfies its specifications, and vice-versa.
 
 Recently, the Thoothukudi district administration seized the sand imported from Malaysia, forcing the importer concerned to approach the Madurai bench of the Madras high court. So, keeping the public safety in mind, the state government passed an order dated December 8, 2017, banning direct sales of imported sand without the nod of PWD, said a senior official from the geology and mining department.
 
 “We noticed that nine trucks bearing Tamil Nadu state vehicle registration numbers were carrying the imported sand. Further enquiries revealed that a Kerala-based company imported the sand from Malaysia and they were being taken to be sold in Palani,” Udumalpet tahsildar Thangavel told TOI. 
 
 Since it was illegal to sell the imported sand without the knowledge of PWD, the trucks, which contain 3 units of sand each, were seized by the Udumalpet revenue divisional officer as recommended by the geology and mining department, said Thangavel.
 
 “The importer was presumed to have paid GST on the consignment and also obtained permission to sell them within Kerala. The trucks were too having transit passes but it was illegal to transport the sand without waybill of the state’s PWD in Tamil Nadu,” explained another revenue official.
