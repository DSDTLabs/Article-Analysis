Rajkot: Gujarat Pradesh   Committee ( ) chief Amit Chavda on Tuesday demanded the resignation of chief minister Vijay Rupani after visiting the family members of  , the 30-year-old Dalit ragpicker, who was lynched by five persons in Rajkot’s Shapar industrial area on Monday. 

 
 Chavda met Vaniya’s family at Parnara village of Limbdi taluka in Surendranagar. He said that the   government had failed to maintain law and order in the state.
 
 After meeting the victim’s family, Chavda told media persons, “Incidents of Dalit atrocity have increased during BJP’s rule. The state government on one had has failed to protect the Dalits, but has been protecting those responsible for the atrocities. This incident has happened in CM’s home town. Taking moral responsibility, Rupani should step down.”
 
 Congress also gave Rs 1 lakh to Vaniya’s family. Party general secretary Rajiv Satav blamed the BJP government at the Centre for diluting the SC/ST atrocity act.
 
 “Dilution of the atrocity act has benefited people with casteist mentality. They have no fear of law. What the BJP government has proposed, favours such people indirectly,” said Satav.
 
 The Congress delegation also demanded 5-acre land in the name of Vaniya’s wife so that she can earn a living. They also demanded that the government pay for the education of Vaniya’s children and bear the cost of his wife’s treatment as she is suffering from a liver disease. 
 
 Chavda was accompanied by SC/ST cell convener Ravindra Dalvi, Danilimda MLA Shailesh Parmar, Soma Patel, Naushad Solanki and Lakha Bharvad and other leaders.
