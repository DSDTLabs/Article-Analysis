HYDERABAD: The   team management believes in the horses for the courses strategy. In a must-win situation against  , the Sunrisers pulled up an ace from their sleeve by playing Afghanistan all-rounder   in place of the inform Kane Williamson. The move, which had the potential to backfire as they sacrificed a batsman for a bowling all-rounder, turned out to be a masterpiece as the hosts romped to a seven-wicket win.

 "We have players on the bench who can straightaway come into the playing XI and perform," Laxman said. "Nabi is someone very good not only after the Powerplay, but also in the Powerplay. That was the rationale behind getting Nabi in. To come and straightaway be in excellent rhythm and also execute the strategy which we had for the opposition batsmen was really good to see. Those first two-three overs set the tone for the match."
 
 "We know that Mumbai Indians are a very good side. So, we had a certain game plan and strategy. Even our combination was changed based on the kind of players they got in their line-up," said team mentor  . "It was more about the left handers in Mumbai Indians line up. Some of them in good form, starting with Parthiv (Patel) and also Nitish Rana at number three."
 
 Laxman also said that they have limited options regarding the overseas players. "But, when you have only four overseas players who can play, you have to work out what is the best combination on that particular day, against the particular opposition keeping the conditions in mind," he said.
 
 The team mentor was happy that they are spoiled for choices this year." "This year, unlike the previous two years, we are spoilt for choices. Sometimes, it is good. This year we got various options and they can just walk in the playing XI and perform just the way Nabi did on Monday evening," he said.
 
 Was there any concern on  's injury? "He should be okay."
