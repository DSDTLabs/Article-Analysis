LUCKNOW: Be sure to check the status of your   registration or you may be asked to evacuate.

 The stamp and revenue department will impose a fine on a builder or property owner if found handing over the property to a buyer without registry.
 
 Assistant inspector general stamp and revenue SK   said the revenue department has received hundreds of complaints in the past week in which people have mentioned that builders have given possession to them without registry. When the buyer demanded registry of the property, the builder told them to pay an extra amount, which was not mentioned anywhere in the documents during the deal of the property.
 
 People have complained that builders demand around 5% of the total amount of property for registry.
 
 District magistrate   said the administration has ordered all magistrates and revenue department officials to impose section 64 of Transfer of Property Act, 1882.
 
 Under this, a builder will be booked if they give possession to any buyer without registry.
