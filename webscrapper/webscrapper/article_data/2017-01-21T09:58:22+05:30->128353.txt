BHOPAL:   to electrocution on Thursday night — the first death this year and 33rd since 2016. What’s worse, its three cubs are nowhere to be found.

 The carcass of the tigress — coded T1 — was found near   in  . It is close to Banas River and Sanjay Gandhi National Park. This is the seventh   death in the country in the first three weeks of 2017.
 
 “It seems the tigress had crossed over into human habitation. Electrocution cannot be ruled out,” said R P Singh, chief of STF (wildlife). “She must have died three days ago. We are now worried for its three cubs. Search teams are out,” said Singh. Sources say the tigress had deep wounds on the eyes and burns on its tail.
 
 Declared a ‘Tiger State’ in 1995, Madhya Pradesh has achieved the dubious distinction of having the highest number of tiger deaths in 2016 — 33, including one mowed down by a train in Hoshangabad on December 29.
 
 Of the 95 tiger deaths last year, 31% were recorded in MP alone. Tigers are either getting killed in battle for territory or after moving out more than 200km from their place of birth, officials say.
 
 Twenty years ago, MP had nearly 20% of India’s tiger population and 10% of the world’s, but now the tiger death toll is alarming. Sources say tiger corridors are being disrupted by continuous movement of heavy vehicles, especially for mining.
