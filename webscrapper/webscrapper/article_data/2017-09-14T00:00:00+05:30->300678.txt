Few things come close to matching the energy of college students enjoying live performances in an outdoor auditorium after a long day’s labour. The OPPO   Fresh Face 2017 auditions brought out the best in the student contestants of New Horizon College, Kasturi Nagar, who put up a spirited show that brimmed with enthusiasm, talent and oodles of confidence. Right from the very first contestant to the last, everyone had something interesting to offer, making it really challenging for the judge — model and actress   — to zero in on the winners.
For the first round, the students put up a mix of talented performances that included singing, dancing, beat boxing, tabla and even solo acting. Contestants such as   (dancing), Archana (singing), Apoorva (dancing) and beat boxers Pramod PK, Harsha and Shawn Micheal stood out with their performances. 
 After witnessing the contestants’ many talents, Ekta chose five girls and five boys for the final round, for which tricky questions were put forth to them to see how witty and street-smart they were. Kulsum Javeed’s mellifluous singing ensured that she emerged as the winner, while tabla player Rahul RK, along with his confident replies, finished first among the boys. Dancer Sneha P and singer   finished as the first runners-up, and dancer/artist Sangeetha N and beat boxer Ayyappa OS took home the second runners-up spot among girls and boys respectively.
