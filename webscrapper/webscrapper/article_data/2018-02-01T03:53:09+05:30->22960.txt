NASHIK: Maharashtra   minister Vinod   on Wednesday said the state government is planning to reduce the load of non-academic work of the teachers in the state.

 “Teachers are assigned   work since years and not only during our government’s tenure. In fact, we are framing a policy not to assign clerical tasks to teachers. This process will take some time but teachers will get less non-academic tasks from now onwards,” Tawde said.
 
 The education minister was in the city to attend the four-day ‘Shikshanachi Wari’, a divisional level convention of teachers organized by the education department. The aim of this event is to make teachers aware about new technologies in the field of education. More than 4,000 teachers from 12 districts of Nashik, Pune and Mumbai are participating in the event.
 
 While addressing teachers, Tawde assured that the decision of his department to shut down more than 1,300 government schools which have less than 10 students will not affect a single student or teacher in the state.
 
 “Schools will be closed only after students and teachers are transferred to other nearby schools which will be preferably 1km away from the existing schools. The government will frame solutions if students have to walk more than a kilometre to go to school. Neither will any teacher lose a job, nor will any student be deprived of education. Students will be shifted to schools where their performace will significantly improve,” Tawde said.
 
 He further added, “More than 1.25 lakh teachers have become technology-friendly in the last three years. Data says that 25,000 students have shifted from English medium private schools to Marathi medium government schools in the last 3 years,” said Tawde.
 
 He praised teachers who have come up with innovative ideas which in turn has contributed to the educational reforms in the state. “Nashik’s ‘Shikshanachi Vaari’ is one positive example of this commitment,” he said.
