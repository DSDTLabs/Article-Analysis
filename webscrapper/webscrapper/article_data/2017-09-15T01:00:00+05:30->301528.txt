PATNA: A massive fire broke out in a plastic furniture factory at   industrial area in   district on Wednesday. After six fire tenders failed to control the blaze, 24 more fire tenders from Patna, Danapur and   were sent to the spot which took more than 24 hours to douse the flames. There was, however, no report of any casualty, Vaishali SP Rakesh Kumar said on Thursday.

 “Two adjacent furniture factories were badly damaged while the third one, a beverage factory in the vicinity, was partially burnt. Property worth crores of rupees was destroyed in the fire. The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained,” the SP said.
 
 Smoke and flames could be seen emanating from the factory from a distance, fire department officials said.
 
 District magistrate   and other senior officials also reached the spot to assess the situation on Thursday. Many families working in both the factories lived in quarters behind the factory’s premises. When the fire started, around 100 workers were working in the factory. The workers and families left their homes for safer place after the factory caught fire. Their belongings, however, were reduced to ashes.
