New Delhi: Doctors at   are examining two-year-old   joined at the head, and will assess whether a surgery can be performed to separate them.

 The twins —   and Balram — from Kandhamal district in Odisha, were brought to the institute on Friday. Dr A K Mahapatra, chief of neuro sciences centre at AIIMS said the children will undergo a series of tests such as MRI, CT scan, and angiogram, to see the extent to which the veins in their brains are fused and whether a surgery was feasible.
 
 “They are craniopagus twins — those connected at the head. This is a rare condition. It is very difficult at this stage to say if a surgery is feasible to separate them. They will undergo several tests in the next 10-12 days and then we will decide,” Dr Mahapatra said.
 
 Dr Deepak Gupta, professor of neurosurgery, said the twins suffer from a rare condition which afflicts one in 30 lakh children, of which 50% die either at birth or within 24 hours of birth. Surgery has been feasible only on 25% of the survivors while the rest continue to live with the condition.
 
 “Also, there is less than a 20% chance of survival among those who undergo the surgery. Such operations are extremely challenging and doctors from plastic surgery, paediatric surgery, anaesthetists and radiologists, among others, will be involved,” Dr Gupta said.
