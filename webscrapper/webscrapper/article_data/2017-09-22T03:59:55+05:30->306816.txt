NEW DELHI: Condemning the attacks on Rohingyas in   and calling upon the Centre to show empathy towards Rohingya refugees and not deport them,   Ulama-i- Hind on Thursday led a demonstration at   in the national capital. 

 The minority organisation has called upon the international community, especially the UN, to take action against the Myanmar government over the ongoing attacks on Rohingyas “instead of merely passing buck and statements condemining the violence”. Speaking at the protest, Maulana Mahmood Madani, general secretary of Jamiat Ulama-i- Hind urged the international community to impose economic blockade against the Myanmar state like it did in the case of  .
 
 “We strongly condemn the current ethnic cleansing and genocide targeted upon Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar which has resulted in deaths of about a thousand innocent civilians, burning of their houses and properties, and forcing as many as 2,70,000 people to flee to neighbouring   in the last three weeks,” it stated in a memorandum. 
 
 The minority organisations want that an international inquiry be instituted into the recent violence in Myanmar and to grant free access to humanitarian aid groups and international media. They have also demanded that uprooted families be rehabilitated. 
 
 Jamiat Ulama-i- Hind has submitted the memorandum to the office of the secretary general of  , Union minister of home affairs   and the ambassador and embassy of Myanmar at New Delhi.
 
 It is pointed in the memorandun that the forced migration of Rohingyas from Myanmar has increased the burden upon the countries where the Myanmar refugees have taken refuge. “Instead of accommodating the ever increasing numbers they are closing their gate and India is even trying to deport such refugees being unable to cope up with the humanitarian demands though it goes against the basic moral fabric for a country like India to not do its part to provide support and shelter to persecuted Rohingya Muslims,” Jamiat Ulama- i Hind emphasised.
