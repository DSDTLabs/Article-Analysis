PANAJI: To promote zero-emission vehicles, the state government has decided to exempt electric vehicles from road tax. 

 Goa is one of the few states in the country to exempt electric vehicles from road tax, transport director   said. “This is an attempt to control pollution by promoting electric vehicles,” a transport official said. In 2017, about eight to ten EVs have been registered in the state, he said. 
 
 Last month, the auto industry body,   (SIAM) had suggested reduction of GST on electric automobiles to 5%, besides one-time I-T deduction of 30% of vehicle price for non-financed buyers.   had also sought exemption of road tax for EVs to promote in India.
 
 A notification signed on Friday states, “In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (2) of Section 11 of Goa,   and Diu Motor Vehicles Tax Act, 1974 (Act 8 of 1974), the government of Goa exempts electric operated vehicles (EOVs) from the payment of tax. The notification shall come into force from the date of its publication in the official gazette.”
