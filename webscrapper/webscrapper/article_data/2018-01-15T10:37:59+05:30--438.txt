PUNE: Lieutenant General D R  , the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Army  , said jointmanship in the armed forces is important to fight the enemy, as no single service can fight a war alone today.

 Talking to media on the sidelines of a wreath-laying ceremony at the   and   on Sunday, Soni said, “The next war is not going to be fought by either the army, the navy or the air force alone. War can never be fought by a single force. It has to be a joint endeavour. Integration of armed forces is a gradual process. But it is a sure process and it is happening. We firmly believe we must fight together to ensure that no enemy can stand in front of us.”
 
 A doctrine of the Indian armed forces released last year too called for a joint approach. “The nature of future warfare requires a harmonious and synergetic application of land, air and sea forces. Joint operations are the most essential requirements of future wars and we have to focus on the seamless application of all available resources to shock, dislocate and overwhelm the belligerent,” the doctrine says.
 
 About the Southern Command’s capacity-building efforts, Soni said, “The command has been working towards professional upgradation of its men, machine and equipment in order to prepare for future wars.”
 
 He also touched upon the issues faced by the veterans. “Though there were some welfare issues in the past, we have enough resources to resolve them,” he said.
