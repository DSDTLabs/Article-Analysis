AMRITSAR: Aam   (AAP) candidate Major General Suresh   (retd) on Thursday filed his nomination papers for the   seat, the byelection for which is scheduled for October 11.

 Khajuria was accompanied by   president and Sangrur MP Bhagwant  , leader of the opposition  , secretary Gulshan Chhabra, party’s district president Gurpartap Singh Khushhalpur and alliance partner and president of Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) Simarjit Singh Bains. He went to file the nomination papers in the office of Gurdaspur district election officer Gurloveleen Singh Sidhu.
 
 Earlier, talking to media persons, Mann said the Gurdaspur assembly constituency was a border district of Punjab and it was the most neglected constituency by all political parties.
 
  He alleged that the BJP government at the Centre and the   government led by Capt   in the state, neither waived off the agricultural debt of the farmers nor paid them the dues of the sugarcane crop as promised by both political parties before the assembly elections.
 
 He alleged that industry in Gurdaspur , Dhariwal and Batala had totally collapsed under the earlier governments.
 
 Meanwhile, Khaira said, “The people of Gurdaspur should reject the political parties which have been luring the voters with money or liquor. The AAP has always tried hard to cleanse the political system and that’s why we have nominated a clean and transparent candidate like Maj. Gen. Khajuria.”
 
 Taking a dig at the BJP and the Congress, Khaira alleged that the candidates para-dropped from Mumbai and Abohar, would never be able to commit full time to the service of Gurdaspur voters.
