Ludhiana: Turbidity has been found in one of the three water samples collected from Government Primary school (GPS) in Sidhwa Bhet, even as all three samples had passed bacteriological tests. In one sample of tap water, turbidity was found higher than the permissible limit.

 District epidemiologist Dr Divjot Singh said: “Water samples are declared potable only if they pass bacteriological tests. So, the samples were passed, but turbidity was found in one of the samples, which could have a bad effect on health in the long term, particularly on kidneys and liver. If samples fail bacteriologically, the effect is immediate in the form of diarrhoea, which could also be severe. One of the reasons for high turbidity could be over-chlorination of water. Now, routine water sampling from GPS in different blocks has also started, and samples are being collected and sent to the state lab in Chandigarh. Ten more samples have been collected from different blocks, while three have been collected from Central Jail, to see if the water is potable or not.”
 
 Commenting on turbidity in water, Dr Divjot Singh said: “Since a   that had high turbidity was cleared bacteriologically, it should not be consumed because it has long-term effects on kidneys and liver, even though it has no short-term effects. MC is aware of this problem, and is taking steps to rectify the tests.” 
 
 Apart from this, three samples were collected from GPS Maulad, one from Sudhar Block, and two from Pakhowal Block. Civil surgeon Dr Hardeep Singh added: “With this regular sampling, chances of outbreaks are very less, as precautionary measures are taken before hand itself. If the water sample from any place fails, the municipal corporation will be informed, so that corrective steps and measures can be taken, after which resampling will be done.”
