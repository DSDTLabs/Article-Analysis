GURUGRAM: Shifting entry and denotifying highways are not the only ways to bypass the ‘500-metre liquor ban’. Illegal  , strategically parked near arterial roads and highways, are proving an ingenious way to circumvent the order.

 The trend came to light on Tuesday when a truck, carrying liquor, was seized in the   of   by the forest department. Mobile thekas are illegal prefabricated structures, often on trucks, that act as liquor vends and have a carrying capacity of 10,000 bottles. Operators usually set up base at a spot and keep changing it as per convenience and demand. These thekas are generally placed in forest areas close to highways and arterial roads. 
 
 While forest officials said the trend was not new, locals told TOI the number of mobile liquor vends has risen over the past week, in the wake of the court order.
 
 “The demand for mobile thekas has gone up, especially after the removal of liquor vends along national and state highways. There are three colleges around Pali, making mobile thekas a profitable business in the area,” said Sarabjeet Kumar, a student and resident of the area.
 
 Jitender Bhadana of  , a Faridabad-based environmental NGO, who raised the alarm on the liquor truck in Pali, said, “Truck operators keep the trolley covered while moving from one place to another, and mostly operate on roads in the forest area, flouting all norms.”
 
 “Ever since the ban, people from far-off places like Gurgaon and Delhi are visiting these trolleys to buy alcohol,” said another resident of Pali requesting anonymity.
 
 Sneh Lata from the Faridabad excise department, too, acknowledged the rise in number of mobile thekas in the area in the past week. “These vends are operating illegally; no such vend has ever been granted permit. I’ll approach the police commissioner to form a team for night vigilance, in a bid to nab the offenders.”
