HYDERABAD:   said that the government would construct one lakh two bedroom (2BHK) houses in   and two lakh houses in the rural areas in the 2017-18 financial year. If the government fails to construct two lakh houses by the end of this year,   would not seek votes from the people in the coming elections. 

 He said construction of about 30,000 houses are in progress and the delays were because contractors were not coming forward. Replying in the Assembly on the budget, the chief minister said opposition leaders are levelling various allegations on budget allocations without any evidence. He said the government was coming up with schemes like sheep rearing and had allocated several thousands of crores for Backward Classes in 2017-18 budget to strengthen the rural economy. He charged the opposition parties with misleading the general public on various issues.
 
  reiterated that the TRS government would not go for early elections as the people have given mandate for five years and faulted Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N Uttam Kumar Reddy for spreading rumours.
 
 On the issue of allocation for Most Backward Classes (MBC) in the budget, he said about Rs 1,000 crore has been set aside for them for 2017-18, adding that the BC Commission will be tasked with identifying the MBC communities. 
 
 Responding to a query from TDP member R Krishnaiah, KCR said the government was in favour of increasing mess charges and scholarships to BCs. A cabinet sub-committee comprising deputy chief minister Kadiam Srihari and minister Jogu Ramanna will make their recommendations soon.
