Almost four years after receiving his own portrait from artist  , former   Pranab Mukherjee made an appearance at the preview of his exhibition, Eyes Say It All, recently. While the former president, who inaugurated the exhibition, expressed his admiration in just one word, "wah", visitors found themselves recalling popular   songs based on eyes.
Dipak greeted everyone at the entrance and took them around, explaining the thought behind the 60 portraits. He said, "My first coloured portrait was of my sister. A person’s eyes always interest me. When I talk to somebody, for me, it’s his/her eyes that tell the story."

 There were many who recalled Bollywood songs at the exhibition. Mayank Bhargava, a visitor, said, "We all have heard songs describing the beauty of eyes, like Teri Aankhon Ke Siva Duniya Mein or Aankhon Mein Kya Ji, and when you look at these portraits you realise that eyes can speak a lot about a person and Bollywood has not overhyped it." Agreeing, another visitor, Suparna Biswal, said, "Eyes speak a lot and we need more such exhibitions to remind us that it’s not emoticons but eyes which express emotions."
