  : The   Assembly on Friday passed the Criminal Laws (Arunachal Pradesh) Amendment Bill 2018 which now empowers the state to award a death penalty or rigorous imprisonment of at least 14 years to anyone found guilty of raping a minor girl below 12 years. 

 "Whoever rapes a woman below 12 years will be punished with death, or rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 14 years but which may extend to imprisonment for life," a clause in the Bill states. Home minister  , who had introduced the Bill on March 9, said this will ensure stringent punishment against perpetrators of crimes against women. 
 
 The bill was brought following a series of recent incidents of rape and murder of minors in the state. Between 2015 and November 2017, 225 cases of rape were reported in the state. 
 
 The public frustration with the rising cases of rape came to the fore on February 19 when Sanjay Sobor (30) and Jagdish Lohar (25), accused of raping and murdering a five-year-old, were beaten to death by a mob which stormed into the Tezu police station in   district. 
 
 Prior to this, an 8-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a 23-year-old government employee at Daporijo in   district on February 14. The accused was subsequently forced to walk naked across the town and later handed over to police. 
 
 On February 22, a six-year-old girl student in Upper Siang district was allegedly raped by her teacher.
