RAKOT: The anti corruption bureau (ACB) nabbed a tax assistant of Kandla Customs House red-handed accepting a bribe of Rs 4,000 in the port town Kutch on Friday. 

 Satya Prakash Mahendra Kumar Gupta, a native of Sawai Madhopur district in Rajasthan, demanded the bribe from a woman to deposit Rs 40,000 as transfer expenses, which otherwise was a part of his duty. The woman approached the ACB and lodged a complaint.
 
 Police inspector, ACB Gandhidham, P V   said, â€œThe woman working in the custom department was recently transferred to Kandla, while Gupta works in the administrative wing of the department. He had to make the bill of Rs 40,000 as the transfer expenses for which he demanded 10% of the amount as bribe. 
 
 ACB sleuths laid a trap and caught him red-handed taking the money.
