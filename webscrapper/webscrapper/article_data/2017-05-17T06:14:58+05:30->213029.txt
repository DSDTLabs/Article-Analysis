MUMBAI: For students of BSc (IT), who were told by university officials that they would not clear their papers, revaluation   that put them in the green came as a sigh of relief.

 The case goes back to February when all barring one student from the   and Open Learning (IDOL) cleared the fifth semester BSc (IT) exam. Some of them shocked at their scores approached the IDOL head who conveyed her helplessness. Students then reached out to vice-chancellor  , asking him to order a recorrection of the entire batch's answer scripts, he in turn promised them to ask the controller of examinations to do so. “The last dates for photocopying and revaluation passed and we never heard from the university,“ said a student. But some candidates on their own applied for revaluation.
 
 On April 3, students once again trekked to the university to get a grip on the status. “The IDOL head told us that she had not received any answer papers for re-assessment. When we went to the exam house, we were given a letter which read that another teacher had assessed the papers and had opined that the revised marks were almost same or lower than the previous scores,“ said another student.
 
 The students then approached the state and asked them to request the university to once again open the dates for applying for revaluation. The university obliged and candidates then took the revaluation route. Two days before the re-exam, of those who had on their own applied for revaluation earlier received their results.Two girls from among the freshers and eight from among the repeaters had passed. The rest have taken a re-exam and are awaiting their revaluation result. Exam controller   said he had followed instructions and asked for a rechecking. “I had only conveyed the subject chairman's order that the marks would remain the same,“ he added.
