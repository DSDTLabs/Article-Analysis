AHMEDABAD: Seven dalit families have been subjected to   of Kheralu taluka of   district after an   eloped and married an adult girl from an OBC community in the same village on January 1 this year.

 The girl (23) from Prajapati community fears that she and her husband will become victims of honour killing. She apprehends that even her in-laws might get killed. The girl has approached the state police and social justice and welfare department for protection.
 
 “I belong to Rohit community (dalit) and I had eloped with the girl and married her on January 1 after which the villagers have stopped all kind of dealings with my family. They are not allowed to use village roads, grocery and milk products from village shops and cannot even use transport in the village. Why are they harassing my community members for my decision to marry a non-dalit girl?” the boy (28) told TOI.
 
 Mahiyal has seven dailt houses and the Prajapati community has about 80 families living in the village which is located some 50km from Gandhinagar.
 
 When contacted, the girl told TOI, “It’s akin to Khap Panchayat. The marriage has become an issue of prestige and honour, so they would not hesitate to kill me, my husband and my in-laws. I have been getting threats from a member of my community panchayat therefore we are running here and there seeking asylum from the casteist goons. I am an adult girl and I have the right to marry a boy with whom I was in relationship for 10 years.”
 
 Village sarpanch Avchal Chaudhari admitted that the dailts have been facing social boycott after the Prajapati girl ran away with the Rohit community boy. “The Prajapti community is in anger so they have asked the villagers not to deal with the dalits but the anger will melt away in near future. No dalit was subjected to violence,” said Chaudhari.
