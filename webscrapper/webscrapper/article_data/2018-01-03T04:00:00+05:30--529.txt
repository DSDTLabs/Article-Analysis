Rajkot: A 46-year-old undertrial died in Surendranagar jail after suffering a heart attack on Tuesday. 

 Zakir Mohammed Shahmadaar, who was arrested three days ago with a stock of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), fell ill on Monday and was first taken to the Surendranagar civil hospital. From there, he was referred to Rajkot Civil Hospital where doctors treated him and sent him back to Surendranagar jail.
 
 However, he felt uneasy on Tuesday morning and died in the jail. 
 
 While police officials maintained that Zakir died of cardiac arrest, his family members alleged that he died due to non-availability of doctor on time in the jail. 
 
 Jailor R C Chaudhary said that there was no permanent doctor for the jail. Three days ago, a murder accused Jasu Jadav, had also suffered chest pain and died in the jail.
