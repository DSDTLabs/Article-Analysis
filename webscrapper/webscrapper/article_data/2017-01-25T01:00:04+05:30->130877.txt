SULTANPUR:   described on Tuesday the recent feud within the SP’s first family as a struggle to uphold “socialist” values in interest of the people at a rally at Motihar area in   Sadar. 

 This was Akhilesh’s first rally after taking over as the party president. “The battle was long and fought at various levels, but it had to be done to uphold socialist values,” he said. “Other people (read opposition) have their own interpretation of it, but for us it was for the sake of samajwad… this was a struggle in your interest,” he told the crowd.
 
 Akhilesh was in a bitter battle with his father and party patriarch   and uncle Shivpal Yadav for the control over the party and its symbol for over four months. On January 16, the Election Commission recognised Akhilesh as the party’s president and gave him the symbol.
 
  However, on Tuesday, minister   — one of the key reasons for the family war — was present on the dais when Akhilesh addressed his first rally. The family feud broke out in September when Akhilesh sacked Prajpati allegedly for irregularities in mining department he was heading. However, he was reinstated later on Mulayam's insistence and was given a different portfolio.. 
 
 Appealing for support to party candidate and sitting MLA Arun Verma, Akhilesh also sought support for Prapjapati, the sitting MLA from Amethi. “He is in the fray from a very important seat so he also needs your support,” Akhilesh said.
