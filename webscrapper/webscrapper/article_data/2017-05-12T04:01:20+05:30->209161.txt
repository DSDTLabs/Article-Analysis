NEW DELHI: Preeti Aggarwal from Rohini will soon be the   of the   while Vijay Kumar Bhagat — from  , a Badli ward located near Bhalswa landfill site — will be her deputy.   has also decided to send the name of Tilak Raj Kataria from Shalimar Bagh to be the chairman of the standing committee — a body where the proposals and policy documents are deliberated upon before being forwarded to the house for final approval.

 Thursday was the last day for filing of the nominations for the posts of mayor, deputy-mayor and six standing committee members including its chairman. The nominees are all likely to be elected on May 18 when the first meeting of the house will be held.
 
 Aggarwal, while talking to TOI, said that her immediate agenda would be to improve the sanitation situation of the city. “We will soon have meetings with the veteran councillors to understand and learn about ongoing projects,” she said. BJP state general secretary Kuljeet Singh Chahal accompanied the nominees along with Sanjeev Nayyar, the outgoing mayor.
 
 BJP has nominated seven people, one extra as a cover candidate, while one nomination each has been filed for the post of standing committee chairman by AAP (Vijay Goel from Wazirpur) and   (Seema Tahira from Walled city).
 
 Apart from Kataria who has been nominated for the post of chairman of standing committee, BJP has fielded Ramesh Kumar Valmiki (East Patel Nagar) as deputy- chairman of standing committee; Jai Prakash (Sadar Bazar), Jayendra Kumar Dabas (Rani Khera), Adesh Kumar Gupta (West Patel Nagar) for the membership of standing committee. State BJP politicians said that an additional candidate, Adesh Kumar, has been fielded because they still see the possibility of getting an extra seat in the standing committee.
 
 While BJP has decided to go with a list which is heavily dominated by people from Baniya and Punjabi community, the party has also tried to accommodate Dalit and Jat faces.
