Who would have thought that a selfie could win you a prize from cops? Well, namma Bengaluru City   is offering citizens that opportunity, but with a catch — safety has to be top priority. As part of its   drive, city cops have launched a contest, #SelfieOnSkywalk, to get people to stop jaywalking on busy roads and instead use pedestrian   dotting town.
The   comes less than a month after the state government announced 100 new skywalks in Bengaluru, following which, Bangalore Times had done a random spot-check at a few existing ones, only to find that hardly anyone ever uses them.
  The campaign’s video has a man holding up a placard that reads ‘You are awesome for talking the skywalk’ to anyone actually using it — much to their amusement. He is also seen at intersections next to skywalks with a placard— ‘Don’t risk it, use the skywalk’ — aimed at those darting through peak hour traffic.
 #SelfieOnSkywalk is on till April 7 and the five best images sent on Twitter or Facebook will be awarded by the DCP East Traffic.
 
 There are so many skywalks, but no one uses them. You can’t force people, They have to be convinced and, hence, this campaign 
 — Praveen Sood, Commissioner of Police
