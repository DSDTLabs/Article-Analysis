MUMBAI: The trial in the   murder case resumed on Tuesday with the cross-examination of key accused  's former assistant Kajal  . 

 During the hearing, Sharma denied the defence's suggestion that she had given a false statement to the   in a bid to save herself from a fraud she had allegedly committed by withdrawing money from Indrani's bank accounts without her knowledge. 
 
 Denying the suggestion put forth by Indrani's advocate Sudeep Pasbola, Sharma said, "It is not correct to say I have withdrawn amounts from Indrani's accounts without her permission. All her bank accounts are linked to her phone. The bank managers have always contacted her before giving money." Sharma further stated that a weekly balancesheet was maintained and Indrani had knowledge of any money spent.
 
  "I didn't do any galat kaam. I was not aware about Sheena Bora...ki wo nahi thi...Main blindly boss ke instructions follow kar rahin thi," Sharma said.
