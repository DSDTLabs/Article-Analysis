 who has inspired many generations of actors with his impeccable acting talent has revealed one of his weaknesses that he will never be able to direct a film.

 Amitabh Bachchan was interacting with media along with  , Jimit Trivedi director   and writer Saumya Shukla at success meet of recently released film   on Thursday in Mumbai.
 
 Bachchan has acted, produced, sung songs and composed songs for numerous movies, so when asked if he will turn director for a film, he said: "I don't know direction and I'll never be able to do that. Actually that's a question, I always wanted to know why and what goes through a director's mind when he has to place a camera in a particular angle and position."
 
 Recipient of four national awards and many other awards when asked whether he feels relaxed before release of every film after working in film industry over almost 49 years,   said: "No... It's always a fear. Much before the film's actual release that's what we talk about. What is going to happen? How many theatres? How much do we expect?are they going to accept the film? 
 
 He said your first weekend collection (Friday- Sunday), if it is say, 10 crores and if you multiply it by 3 that is the estimate which your film eventually will do so, I don't understand that much but if that's the assumption that we take mathematically so, we are on good ground with '102 Not Out'"
 
 Amitabh Bachchan next will be seen in  's film followed by  's triology  .
