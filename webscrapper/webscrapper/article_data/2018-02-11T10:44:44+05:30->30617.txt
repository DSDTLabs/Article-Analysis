SHILLONG: Taking on chief minister   directly, National People's Party (NPP) president   on Saturday vowed to end "Congress misrule forever" in the state. Addressing several rallies under Bajengdoba constituency to campaign for NPP candidate Pongseng R Marak, Conrad Sangma said the chief minister will lose in both the seats he is contesting, Ampati and Songsak. 

 Speaking at a rally on Saturday after welcoming more than 600 Congress workers from different areas of Bajengdoba and Kharkutta constituencies into the NPP fold, Conrad said, "People have realized that there is no future in the Congress. We are extremely confident that with united support, NPP will be able to form the next government in Meghalaya."
 
 Pointing to poor development indices achieved by the ruling government, Conrad said, "Congress has failed to ensure transparency in implementation of different central schemes and the end result has been that people have suffered a lot. We have to end Congress misrule forever and choose a party that will work to create a new Meghalaya."
 
 He lambasted the chief minister and his government for allegedly failing to implement the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and make roads in interior areas of  . "As chief minister of Meghalaya, Mukul has focused only on Ampati, but the fact remains that he could not even develop his own constituency. It is time that we wake up and ensure the end of Congress once and for all," the Tura Lok Sabha MP said.
 
 Saying the Congress has been creating a false fear that religious institutions and minorities will face harassment if NPP comes to power because it is an ally of the BJP, Conrad said the ruling party is not daring to raise other 'relevant' issues. "NPP has always raised its pitch for the indigenous people and minorities. We have been working with the Centre to ensure that development reaches not just Meghalaya but the entire northeast," he said.
