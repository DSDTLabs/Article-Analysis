Pimpri Chinchwad: Councillors from Alandi Municipal Council (AMC) have threatened to launch an agitation against Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation for its alleged failure to take proper measures to curb pollution in Indrayani river. The councillors said that people in the area were suffering from gastroenteritis and jaundice because of release of effluents into the river. AMC councillors Smita Raikar, Pratima Gogavale, Prajakta Ghundre, Shaila Tapkir and Snehal Kurhade recently submitted a memorandum to municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar to reduce flow of effluents into the river and provide clean water to people in Alandi. AMC chief executive officer Samir Bhumkar maintained that water is supplied to citizens after it is chlorinated. Lakhs of devotees from Maharashtra and Karnataka visit Alandi, a popular place of pilgrimage for being the resting place of 13th century Marathi Bhakti saint Sant Dnyaneshwar, to take a dip in Indrayani river. In 2014, AMC had submitted letter to the municipal corporation for providing 5 lakh litres of water through pipeline. However the project did not materialise because residents in the municipal corporation limits were not getting adequate water, the corporators said. There is water hyacinth along Indrayani river. Effluents are mainly released through canals at Chikhli, Talawade and Moshi.  Though there are sewage treatment plants at Chikhli and Moshi, the civic body wants to augment their facilities. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, while attending a function at Alandi in March 2017, had said that the pollution in the river was because of discharge of untreated effluents by the municipal corporation.
