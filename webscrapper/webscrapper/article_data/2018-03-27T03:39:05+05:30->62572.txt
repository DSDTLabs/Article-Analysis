MUMBAI: A child's bicycle, which lay abandoned on the railway track between   and   stations, delayed train services on the Harbour line during morning peak hours on Monday. 

 Commuters on Harbour line faced inconvenience for the second day in a row, after Sunday's nine-hour traffic block.
 
 On Monday, around 7.40 am, the motorman of a train spotted the bicycle lying on the track near Sanpada station and halted the train. "He alerted the control room after which the bicycle was moved away from the tracks," said a railway official.
 
  inspector Sanjay Burma said: "Slum-dwellers trespass onto the tracks as there is no boundary wall between Sanpada and Juinagar." -Somit Sen & George Mendonca
