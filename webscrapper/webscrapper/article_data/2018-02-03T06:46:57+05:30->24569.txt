AHMEDABAD: The   run by homeopath,  , is all set to get bigger as   on Friday arrested two women agents, Vanita Patel and Kushboo Patel, for   for ovary eggs that would be extracted by a doctor who is not authorized to do so.

 Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) zone -5, Himkar Singh, said both the women agents had persuaded around 30-35 women promising them Rs 15,000 per egg to be extracted by homeopath Piyush Patel.
 
 “Vanita, the main agent, used to get Rs 1,000 per woman. Khusboo was getting Rs 500 for the same work,” DCP Himkar Singh said. 
 
 “They used to take an undertaking from the women they brought for “donating” eggs,” he said. “But they were breaking the law by taking the women to a doctor who was not authorized to administer even an injection,” the DCP said.
 
 Inspector of Ramol Police station said a woman home guard jawan, Sonal Parmar, was sent to Dr Piyush Patel for donating eggs after promising her Rs 15,000.
 
 “She was taken to different places in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan many times and even given an injection by Dr Patel,” said the police inspector.
 
 “Parmar died of kidney failure in October 2017. Her brother had then submitted an application of complaint with us. We had sent the complaint and details to the medical board which determined that Dr Patel was a homepath and not authorized to give even an injection” said the inspector of Ramol police station.
 
 DCP Himkar Singh said that as Parmar was taken to different places out of the state, they would soon be dispatching a team to those places to verify whether the doctors there were authorized to conduct such surgeries.
 
 “We have also summoned Dr Nisarg Patel who is a practicing allopathic doctor for recording his statement. We have also recovered some documents from Dr Piyush Patel’s clinic which include names of persons who had received the donated eggs,” DCP Himkar Singh said.
