Lucknow: ‘UP ko yeh saath pasand hai’, the slogan raised after the alliance between then ruling   and a beleaguered   Party, neither proved true in the assembly elections, nor is likely to be repeated.

 “We have decided the Congress will contest the forthcoming urban civic polls in Uttar Pradesh alone, without allying with any party, including the Samajwadi Party,” informed UP Congress Committee president  , speaking to the TOI after a series of meetings with the UP leaders in the last one month.
 
 Babbar said before taking any decision it was important for the party leadership to view the alliance, so there were meetings with district level workers, the winners in the elections and those who secured more than 1 lakh votes. 
 
 “The exercise was to find the cause of the most humiliating defeat at the hands of the BJP while the other agenda was to discuss the urban civic polls in the state and it was decided that the party will contest without any alliance with any political party,” said Babbar.
 
 State leaders have been told to focus on the elections and mobilise committed workers and supporters who can devote time and energy for the party, said Raj Babbar, whose decision of going to polls alone would be another setback to the Samajwadi Party president and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, who is already struggling to recover from the shock of defeat in assembly polls.
 
 After all three meetings, Congress high command held with the district/city chiefs, the seven poll winners as well as losers nearly 100, it was decided that the party should not enter any alliance with the party.
 
 Raj Babbar said every political party wants to consolidate itself and that is why, for the first time, even the Bahujan Samaj Party is contesting the civic elections on its symbol in Uttar Pradesh.
