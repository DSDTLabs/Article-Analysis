CHANDIGARH: PGI is one of the first institutes to find a stem treatment for what   was suffering from, a motor neuron disease known as ALS (Amyotrohic Lateral Sclerosis). The renowned physicist died on Wednesday. He was diagnosed with the disease at the age of 20. Hawking had given permission to the Annals of neurosciences, a PGI journal, to print a biography about his disease. In the biography, he said he survived on ventilator for 24 years. 

 Dr  , who retired as the head of the department of neurology, was the principal investigator of this stem cell study. He has now started monitoring ALS patients who have been given a medicine mainly approved for dementia and stroke. “Stem cell therapy stopped the progress of the disease by 1.5 years. However, we are now seeing the effect of a drug usually used to treat other neurodegenerative disease on the progression of ALS,” said Dr Prabhakar.
 
 In India, there have been no such clinical trials, while China, Japan and Korea have conducted them. “ALS deteriorates and wastes muscles, but does not affect the brain. A person can live for long if care is taken. Till now, there is no cure for ALS. We can only slow down the progression,” said Dr Prabhakar. The motor neuron disease leads to muscle wastage and in the end, the person dies. There is no treatment for the disease. The malady progresses from muscle wastage of the lower limb, resulting in frequent falls, spreading to the upper limb to slurring of speech.
 
 Walter G Bradley, an authority in ALS, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami commented on Stephen’s biography and said, “Prof Hawking writes eloquently about his approach to life with ALS. In fact, he indicates that the diagnosis of the disease gave him the jolt that launched his eminent career.”
