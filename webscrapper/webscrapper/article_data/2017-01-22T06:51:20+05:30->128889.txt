CHENNAI: Jallikattu is all set for a grand return in   on Sunday with an ordinance issued for conducting the bull taming sport after a three-year-long ban but protesters on   beach and elsewhere refused to end their agitation unless a “permanent“ solution is found.

 Tamil Nadu governor Ch   Rao promulgated on Saturday an ordinance for the conduct of jallikattu, after getting sanction from the President as envisaged under Article 213 of the Constitution. A Raj Bhavan press release said, “Owing to protests against the ban on jallikattu from students and from people of all walks of life in Tamil Nadu and considering the sentiments of Tamils and to protect their cultural right, the governor had decided to promulgate an ordinance.“
 
 Chief minister O   said jallikattu would take place on Sunday in Alangallur in Madurai and the rest of the state. “Our dream of having jallikattu this year has been realised,“ he said, promising to flag off the event in   at 10am on Sunday. State ministers will preside over similar events elsewhere, mainly in southern and western parts of the state.
 
 Even after the Centre and the state government worked feverishly on the ordinance to negate a Supreme Court order, the agitators, mainly comprising youth and students in the “Marina uprising“ and elsewhere, have rejected the ordinance route as a “temporary solution“, and threatened to continue their agitation until a permanent solution was arrived at. Many protesters said they were not happy with the ordinance since it can be challenged.
 
 Panneerselvam assured that the state would introduce a bill replacing the ordinance on Monday, the very first day of the assembly session. He explained that the state did not want to delay a proper law as the maximum validity of the ordinance is six months.
