PATNA: The absence of RJD president   and his sons -- deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and health minister   Yadav -- from the inaugural   function at   on Wednesday, has prompted the opposition to say that all was not well within the ruling grand alliance.
 
  Former deputy CM and BJP MLC   said on Thursday that there was tension in the “alliance of compulsions”. “A fortnight back, the road construction department headed by Tejashwi organised a function in Vaishali and its ads did not have the photo of Bihar CM Nistih Kumar. The invitation cards of the Bihar Diwas function, organised by the education department headed by  , did not have the photo and name of Tejashwi,” Modi pointed out.
  
  He said Tejashwi, who is in charge of Saran district, also did not attend the Bihar Diwas programme organised in the district while his elder brother Tej Pratap, who is in charge of Vaishali, stayed away from the function in Vaishali.
  
  “The entire Lalu clan boycotted the Bihar Diwas programmes because they were not invited with due respect,” the BJP functionary said.
  
  Tejashwi evaded question on the issue while his mother and former CM Rabri Devi also ignored the questions asked by newsmen.
  
  However, RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari said not carrying the deputy CM’s name and photo on the Bihar Diwas invite was a grave mistake. He also urged the education minister to probe and fix the accountability for this mistake.
  
  “At the same time, I would like to put it on record that the deputy CM could not attend the function because of personal reasons,” said Tiwari.
  
  Failing to hide their annoynace, both Tiwari and RJD MLA Bhai Birendra also recalled their strength in the alliance. “We have 80 MLAs,” said Bhai Birendra.
  
  The two other allies -- Nitish Kumar’s JD (U) and Congress -- have 71 and 27 MLAs respectively.
