KOLKATA: A Calcutta high court order has left 2,000-odd members of Cine Central, Calcutta, in the lurch. With the court ordering all occupants of 2, Chowringhee Road to vacate the premises within a fortnight, the largest film society , which had Satyajit Ray as its founder vice-president, of the country is now staring at an uncertain future.

 When Cine Central, Calcutta, was founded in 1965 with veteran director   as its president, it had ushered in good news for the city's cine enthusiasts. In absence of internet or DVDs, the screenings hosted by this film society provided cine buffs with a rare opportunity to watch good foreign and regional cinema. In 1980, Ray had inaugurated its week-long festival commemorating 25 years of `Pather Panchali'. British film critic Marie Seton had come to this office to hold a meeting. More recently , Nawazuddin Siddique came down to shoot at this office for  's ` Anwar Ka Ajab Kissa'.
 
 “This address was originally known as Bristol Hotel. During World War II, it served as the officers' mess of the US Army .Currently , there is a dispute regarding the ownership of the building and the 40 tenants are caught in the crossfire. Where do we get the funds to shift?“ wondered  , the general secretary of Cine Central, Calcutta. Former chief justice Shyamal Sen is the current honorary president.
 
 Some years back, the film society had donated 100 prints of movies to the Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute. Yet, a lot still remains at this address. That apart, the office has rare books and a collection of the print edition of the famous `Sight and Sound' magazine before it went digital. “It also has rare print issues of `Films and Filming', which has great archival value for students of serious cinema. We are exploring legal options. If we have to move out, Cine Central, Calcutta, will fade into oblivion,“ Mukherjee said.
