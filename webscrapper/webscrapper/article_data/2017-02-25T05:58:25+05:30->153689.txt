NEW DELHI: After mediation proceedings for six days in the Supreme Court, tennis ace Leander   and his estranged partner   failed to sort out their differences for an ‘out-of-court’ settlement. The mediation was done on the direction of the apex court which had asked the couple to sit together to explore ways to come to an amicable resolution of their dispute. 

 Both Paes and   personally appeared before the SC’s mediation centre where six rounds of proceedings took place for over 18 hours.
 
 The couple is locked in a legal battle over maintenance and custody of their 11-year-old daughter since 2014 when Pillai had filed a case of domestic violence and harassment against Paes and his father in a magistrate’s court in Mumbai. She had sought maintenance but her plea was opposed by Paes who claimed that he was not married to Rhea, and hence, she was not his wife.
 
 While hearing an appeal filed by Pillai challenging the order of Bombay HC which had refused to grant her relief in the dispute, the SC on January 13 asked the couple to go for mediation. Earlier too, on the direction of the HC, they had tried mediation but had failed to resolve their differences.
