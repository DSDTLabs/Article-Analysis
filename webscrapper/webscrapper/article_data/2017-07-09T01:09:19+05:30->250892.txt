Thanjavur: After visiting   village and   oil wells on Saturday, social activist ‘Traffic’ K Ramaswamy said that since the ongoing oil and gas extraction was conducted against the wishes of Kathiramangalam villagers, a case will be filed against ONGC in the Madras bench of Madurai court, requesting the court to instruct ONGC to vacate the village. He also demanded action against the police who arrested 10 villagers during the protest.

 While briefing the reporters, Ramasamy alleged that the villagers had every right to demand ONGC to leave their hamlet, as pipelines have been established without getting proper permission and without informing the sons of the soil.
 
 “Residents are scared, not knowing what might happen and farmers are yet to receive the compensation assured by ONGC. In order to expel ONGC from the village and get due compensation for the farmers, who handed over their fertile land to the corporation, I have decided to file a case soon,” he said, adding that he himself will appear before the court to argue for the villagers.
 
 He asked the people not to return their identity cards like Aadhar, Voter ID and ration cards to the district administration, in protest. He said that would not bring any fruitful solution, as the district administration never takes any action.
 
 “Police have been preventing the family members of the 10 villagers, who were arrested, to meet them at Trichy central prison. There is also a plan to approach the court demanding action against the police officials", he further said. 
 
 Earlier, Ramaswamy visited the farm lands reportedly affected by oil spillage, held conversation with the villagers and assured some action for their cause. 
 
 Meanwhile, the protest entered the eighth day on Saturday with traders still shut down, opposing ONGC.
