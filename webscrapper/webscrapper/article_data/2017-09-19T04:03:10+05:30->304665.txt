Ghaziabad: A 27-year-old woman, working as the head of human resource in a Noida-based electronics firm in Sector 63, committed suicide in her flat on Monday after a tiff with her husband. 

 The body of Deepti Bhardwaj (27) was retrieved by police after breaking open the the door of her eighth floor apartment in Panchsheel Wellington housing society in Crossings Republik.
 
 The woman lived in the rented flat with her husband, Varun (28), a sales manager with a Noida-based construction firm, ever since her marriage in March 2016.
 
 According to police, Deepti did not open the flat’s door on Sunday when Varun returned from office. Varun spent the night in the flat of his brother-in-law, Arun Kumar, who lives on the 12th floor of the same society.
 
 Police said the couple started quarrelling barely a few months into their marriage. Following a quarrel in the recent past, Varun had emailed a complaint against her to police. 
 
 “Varun had complained that Deepti had thrashed him during a fight. Two cops had gone to their flat on Sunday for counselling but she refused to open the door saying Varun was not at home. Varun went directly to the police station for counselling after he returned from office. He called Deepti on her mobile phone from the police station but was verbally abused by her. When Varun returned home, Deepti did not open the flat’s door. She did not open the door either for the maid or for Varun on Monday morning. Finally police broke open the door at around 1.30 pm,” Arun Kumar told TOI.
 
 Police said Deepti was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her bedroom with a stole around her neck. 
 
 Varun has claimed that Deepti had been undergoing treatment for psychiatric disorders, which is being examined. “A case will be registered against the woman’s husband and in-laws since the couple had not completed seven years of marriage. The body has been sent for post-mortem,” said SHO, Vijay Nagar, Naresh Singh.
