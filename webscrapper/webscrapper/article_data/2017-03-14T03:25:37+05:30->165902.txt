MUMBAI: Expect a shortage of   and   cabs on Tuesday as   plan to stay off roads for the second time in four days. 

 On Monday, the Action Committee of Maharashtra, a group of tourist taxi drivers’ unions, said that the aggregator cab   will participate in a   at   to demand more incentives and better earnings. While sources in aggregator firms said a majority of the drivers have decided not to join Tuesday’s  , they may not ply if there’s a law and order situation. During the agitation on March 10, several drivers were threatened and told not to ply cabs. 
 
 “On Tuesday, we will assemble at Azad Maidan from 10am for a rally that will be addressed by several union leaders,” said Raju Patil of Sangharsh Tourist Chalak Malak Sangh. “On March 10, we had taken a morcha to the Ola office in Andheri and the Uber office in Kurla (W) and submitted our demands. But it seems that our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. If our demands are not met, the drivers plan to go on an indefinite strike from March 21.” 
 
 While both Ola and Uber officials refused comment on Monday, on March 10, Uber had issued a statement “regretting the disruption caused to our rider and driver community by a small group of individuals”. 
 
 A L Quadros of the Mumbai Taximen’s Union said: “We have appealed to all black-and-yellow taxi drivers to ply on Tuesday and cater to the passenger demand in case there’s a second strike by the aggregator cab drivers. We do not support the strike.” Also see, P4
