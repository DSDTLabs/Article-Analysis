NRI affairs minister K T Rama Rao on Monday urged Union external affairs minister   to make available a list of fake universities in different countries so that students are not taken for a ride. At the meeting in New Delhi,   said that a large number of students from Hyderabad go abroad for studies. “If the names of fake universities are put up on a website, it will help them avoid applying there,” he said.

 KTR also urged the minister to appoint Telugu translators in all the embassies in the Gulf. If necessary, the state government itself would send translators from the state, he said. This well help several migrants as they usually are unable to explain their situation at the embassy due to language issues. tnn
