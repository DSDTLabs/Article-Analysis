BEHRAMPORE: A day after the bus accident at Murshidabad’s  , divers recovered six more bodies from the creek, taking the toll to 42. The accident has left the state thinking whether it would revoke the bus franchise system as private operators often run state transport undertaking (STU) buses on a long-term lsease in exchange of monthly royalty through this system.

 The bus, which plunged 25ft into a creek from the Balirghat bridge, was also being run by a franchisee. Ironically, North   State Transport Corporation ( ), which owned the bus, did not receive any royalty from the  , to whom it had given the bus on January 8, 2017.
 
 Preliminary inquiry revealed that NBSTC had given two buses in January 2017 to the Behrampore Municipality. The municipality had then handed them to a private operator — Behrampore Tours and Travels — that ran the buses on Karimpur-Malda and   routes. According to the agreement, the municipality used to receive a monthly royalty of Rs 22,000 and Rs 19,000 from the operator. The agreement had expired in September 2017.
 
 Since then two youths, Sentu Sk and Mintu Sk, took over to run a bus. Both had reportedly paid Rs 10,000 to the municipality for running the vehicle. “Both Sentu Sk and Mintu Sk were killed in Monday’s accident,” said Berhampore SP Mukesh Kumar.
 
 CM Mamata Banerjee also indicated an inquiry to ascertain the reason behind the accident. Left and Congress, however, demanded a judicial inquiry led by a retired judge into what they called a “man-made tragedy”.
 
 Also, there are some basic criteria for a driver of a bus run by STUs and none of them were met. Transport department will carry out an internal audit to find out the exact number of franchisees with five STUs.
