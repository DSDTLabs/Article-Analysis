BENGALURU: 
 

  
 
 
  We have requested Siddaramaiah to treat both Datta Peeta and the dargah separately. In fact, revenue records clearly state the same. The distance between the two is 5-6 km by walk. We want the government to set up a fact-finding committee that will dig into old records and ascertain facts. 
 
  
 
  We continue to remain aggressive in our fight; only the language and tone is different now. Earlier, we wanted the tomb to be removed from near Datta Peeta, now we want it to be given to the dargah. There is no change in our stand that Datta Peeta should be recognized as a place of Hindu worship. 
 
  
 
 
  We ar e for communal harmony. But pseudo-secularists have been misleading all by defending encroachment of the shrine. The encroachments haven't been done by Hindus. This is precisely why we have been saying that the government should take a decision on the basis of revenue records, else admit that encroachment of the Hindu shrine is acceptable. 
 
  
 
 
  Development issues are important and we have never slipped on that front. I have undertaken many works in my constituency, but we cannot leave this issue behind. We are demanding justice, not any favour. 
 
  
 
 We could not as the matter was in the Supreme Court. Now that the court has told the Siddaramaiah government to find a solution, it should be done.
