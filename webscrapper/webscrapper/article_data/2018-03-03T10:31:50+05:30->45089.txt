KOLHAPUR: The   state (permanently) unaided schools action committee has asked the headmasters of the schools to abandon the assessment process and intimate about the same to the respective secretaries of the division.

 Khanderao Jagdale, vicepresident of the committee, told TOIthat they have been waiting for government to take some action on their demands; however, they have been getting mere promises.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 “We met education minister   on Monday. He told us that they are going to take a call on our demands soon. But they have been telling us the same thing for past few years and it is not at all acceptable,” said Jagdale.
 
 He added that they have been agitating for the past few weeks in Mumbai. “We are not going to budge. There is no question of taking anyone holding students at ransom during the exam period. If anyone is guilty, it is the government,” he said.
 
 The committee plans to intensify its agitation through an indefinite hunger strike from March 5. “Unless the government comes out with a concrete solution, we won’t be calling off our agitation. This is surely going to impact the paper assessment process,” he said.
 
 The committee has around 70,000 members from across the state and 20,000 of them are involved in paper assessment process. “Timely intervention can ensure that every answer sheet is assessed properly,” he said.
 
 Despite approving the 20% grant step-by-step to the eligible schools, they have not been paid. By natural growth, permanently unaided schools should have got 40% aid by now, but that is not the case.
