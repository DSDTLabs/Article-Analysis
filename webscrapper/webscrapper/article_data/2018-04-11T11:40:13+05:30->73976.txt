BHUBANESWAR : The   government suffered a setback as the   ( ) has pulled out of 'Make in Odisha Conclave 2018' as an industry partner.

 The state government said the move not to partner for the 'Make in Odisha Conclave' in November was "disappointing" as CII was designated as the industry partner for all investment promotion activities.
 
 The government had proposed to organise the biennial showpiece conclave for investments from November 11-15.
 
 "On April 4, CII, represented by Chairman,  , informed the industries department regarding its inability to partner for the conclave in view of prior engagements during the proposed dates of the conclave. The response of CII is particularly disappointing keeping in view the fact that in 2015, the Odisha government designated CII as the Industry Partner for all investment promotion activities," said a government statement.
 
 It said the state government had been engaging with various stakeholders including CII to discuss the modalities of organising the event.
 
 In February, CII shared draft conditions of partnership and a list of proposed CII coordinators for various committees to organise the various events as well as the proposed budget.
 
 CII had been working until recently with the state government officials towards planning for the event, it added.
 
 The government, however, said it remains committed towards the successful organisation of 'Make in Odisha Conclave 2018' in coordination with various stakeholders.
 
 In a related development, CII Chairman (Odisha chapter) Arun Misra and its Vice Chairman   tendered their resignations.
 
 CII had partnered with the Odisha government at the inaugural edition of 'Make in Odisha' conclave organised in November 2016.
