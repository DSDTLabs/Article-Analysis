NEW DELHI: BJP president   is set to decide candidates for around 70 eastern UP assembly constituencies after senior party members from the state held a meeting with him and home minister   on Thursday ahead of the party’s central election committee meetings.

 The party will finalise candidates for most constituencies after the two meetings in which PM Modi will be present. In the first list on Saturday, candidates for NCR and west UP will be declared, followed by another on Monday for candidates from central and parts of eastern UP and Bundelkhand.
 
 Sources said Shah will review the state election committee list of probables for constituencies in Varanasi, Azamgarh and Gorakhpur where he had worked extensively during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. “The party chief will decide on eastern UP candidates in consultation with the PM and the home minister,” said a senior party member.
 
 Polling in the three divisions will take place in the final three phases, giving BJP enough time to decide the candidates. Sources said the party had to take all factors into consideration including caste permutations. The two alliance partners,   Rajbhar-led Bharatiya Samaj Party and Anupriya Patel’s Apna Dal, also have presence in the eastern region. Rajbhar might get five-six seats whereas Patel might get around 10 .
