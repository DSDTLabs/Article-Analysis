PANAJI: While the Congress said the contentious issue of a pre-poll alliance was pending with AICC president  , the United Goans Party (UGP) maintained that it was on track.

 Notwithstanding the consistent stance against an alliance with secular parties for the February 4 state assembly election, the Congress did a U-turn and agreed to an alliance with   (GFP), UGP and the Nationalist   (NCP). But the seat-sharing arrangement did not find favour with GFP, which has now threatened to pull the plug.
 
 With barely 20 days to go for ballot day, the uncertainty has served to muddle what appears to be an interesting election. Amidst the dust swirling around the alliance talks, Monserrate appears to be the only sign of clarity.
 
 Confident that the alliance would go ahead with GFP and NCP, Monserrate said a formal announcement was due on Saturday. “GFP is not going to pull out. I think talks have just stalled, as far as GFP is concerned, over the Velim seat,” he said.
 
 Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardessai is adamant that GFP’s candidate, the two-time ZP member Anthony Rodrigues alias Babush, should contest from Velim, a seat the Congress has already allotted to Filipe Nery Rodrigues.
 
 “As far as Velim is concerned, we have announced our candidate and he has started his campaigning. It would not be fair to stop him,” a senior Congress leader said.
 
 With both parties not willing to back down, Monserrate felt an understanding would be reached, where both candidates could be allowed to contest in a ‘friendly fight’, a concept already put in play at Cortalim.
 
 UGP candidate, Ramakant Borkar, will contest in Cortalim where Congress candidate, Gilbert Mariano Rodrigues, will also stand. 
 
 “The matter is pending before Sonia Gandhi and it would not be proper for me to comment,” Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president  , said.
