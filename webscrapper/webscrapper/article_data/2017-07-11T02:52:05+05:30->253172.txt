MUMBAI: The   group   meeting on Monday decided to give 3,000 sq m of an amenity   in Vakola to a private   from Bengaluru to use as a   kitchen. 

 The Congress opposed the proposal but Shiv Sena leader Yashwant Jadhav said the NGO offered to provide free meals. “Initially, it will provide a meal to 5,000 civic school children and over time increase it to 50,000 children,” he said.
 
 The Congress said tenders should have been invited. “Besides, the Vakola plot is an   space which the   took back from a hotel after a lot of struggle, then why give it to an private entity again?” Congress   leader Ravi Raja in the BMC said.
