BENGALURU:   as age and identity proof may soon be made mandatory for player entries at national-level meets conducted by sports federations.   hopes this will curb age fraud to a great extent.

 As a first step, the ministry has asked   ( ) to follow the example of the   (SGFI) and develop a system to accept competition entries online within three months.   plans to make Aadhar compulsory from this season not only for entries to national-level competitions but also for registration of new players.
 
 “In a bid to streamline and adopt a transparent method in selection of players teams in competitions... it is desirable to accept entries of players teams online.All NSFs are required to develop and migrate to online systems within three months. After that, sending and accepting entries should be done online only and in no case should entries be accepted physically ,“ the ministry said.
 
 Besides the basic details of a player, the ministry is keen that all federations make the unique ID compulsory so that age and identity of athletes are established.
 
 “We were impressed by the software developed by SGFI and the way it has put certain checks and balances in place. It has made Aadhaar mandatory and will implement it in its camps and while receiving entries for its meets. It will also ask its state units to follow suit. It is a progressive move and we thought of extending it to other federations as well. Aadhaar will help us root out age fraud. The biometric details that Aadhaar has will help federations identify proxies in tournaments,“ sources told TOI.
 
 When told that Aadhaar too relies on documents such as birth certificates, the sources said: “We are aiming at uniformity .Aadhaar is an ID backed by the government. It is better than many other documents whose veracity is questioned at some stage or another. In any case, if a player is still found to be overage, federations will fall back on age determination tests.“
