 It was at the resort that Sonam asked Sharma about the friends, but he claimed that they were on the way. Thereafter, Sonam was offered water mixed with sedatives for the second time and she fell asleep once again. She woke up only to find herself naked in the bed.
 
 Sharma somehow managed to pacify her before leaving her at Poonam Chambers later in the day.
