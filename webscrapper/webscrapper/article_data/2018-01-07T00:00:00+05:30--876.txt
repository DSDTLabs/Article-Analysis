The annual   bash is one of the most awaited evenings in the social calendar of Bengaluru’s gourmands and social butterflies. And needless to say, the city’s swish set ensured they kickstarted their year on a super chic high at the 2018 edition of this event. In case you missed it, here’s bringing you the low-down on all the fun things that made this evening a night to remember!
We really couldn’t help notice the city’s fashion royalty   and   chatting constantly when waiting to present awards. We’re sure that would have been one spicy and interesting table to have been seated at! The evening saw many people dressed in black, the safest for an evening out.
