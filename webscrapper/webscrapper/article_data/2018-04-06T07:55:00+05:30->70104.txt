LUDHIANA: The Ludhiana police on Thursday detained a Congress councillor and his 13 supporters after they marched towards the house of   (LIP) leader and MLA, Atam Nagar Simarjit Bains, in Kot Mangal Singh. The Congress councillor from Ward No.48, Parvinder Lapran, claimed he and a large number of his supporters were prevented from marching towards the LIP leader’s house to seek his answer on the recovery of heroin from a candidate fielded by him, and an apology.

 Eyewitnesses said Lapran and his supporters were holding placards in their hands and heading towards the LIP leader’s house in Kot Mangal Singh, when they were stopped about half a kilometre before his residence and whisked away. “Police lathi-charged us and I received a minor injury. Later, 13 of us were detained and brought to Sadar police station,” said Lapran.
 
 He added that he and his supporters were marching peacefully towards the LIP leader’s house to seek his explanation on his partyman’s arrest for drug smuggling. “It is not me seeking an answer from him, but over 1.64 lakhs voters of his constituency to whom he is accountable.”
 
 However, Bains said Punjabis living across the world knew about his credentials. He alleged that the protest was pre-planned and stage-managed. Taking a swipe at chief minister Captain  , he said the government had failed to fulfil its promise of making Punjab drug-free.
 
 Meanwhile, additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP)   refuted allegations that the police resorted to lathi-charge. He said Parvinder and his supporters were booked under sections 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation) of the IPC, which is a non-bailable offence. He added that those booked in the case were at large.
