Vijayawada: Nidabrolu and Eluru railway police limits within Vijayawada division have witnessed as many as six deaths in the last one week alone - making it almost one death per day.

 Back on March 24, Bapatla police recovered two bodies in Nidabrolu area where they managed to identify a youngster while another sexagenarian was yet to be identified.
 
 In the first incident, a 20-year-old youth died after falling off a fast-moving train behind PBN College area. In the second incident, a 62-year-old unidentified man was killed on the spot after being hit by a speeding train while he was crossing the tracks at Nidabrolu railway station.
 
 Just a couple of days later, another mishap occurred on the same Nidabrolu stretch of tracks. This time too, police failed to identify the body that was reportedly disfigured beyond recognition. On April 2, an 18-year-old youth named P Pradeep, who worked as an auto-rickshaw driver, reportedly committed suicide in Gannavaram area under Eluru railway police limits. 
 
 “Mishaps mostly occur at places where the trains move at a faster speed. Youngsters aboard trains need to be cautious and not stand near the door as even a little peek out of the door can result in a fatal accident,” superintendent of railway police KV Mohan Rao said.
