BHOPAL: Central India's only weather doppler radar — a critical component in the accurate forecasting of weather events — has been put to rest due to the   season.

 
 
 The   circle of Meteorological department fears that the high-tech apparatus may develop a snag due to the high temperature in the city as its air conditioners are not working at the “optimum capacity”.
 
 Weather officials said that the doppler radar would be more in need during monsoons for precise readings of thunderstorms and shower spells — and so they are not taking any chances.
 
 The radar set up at the seventh floor of the   building in Bhopal has been switched off. When TOI asked why not fix the air conditioners, rather than switching off the radar, officials said that the ACs will be repaired only after the money is released from the head office in Nagpur, adding that they do not have financial autonomy and have to depend on the headquarters for funds.
 
 “We have prepared a proposal to repair air conditioners and sent it to our headquarters. It is a matter of just few days and the doppler will start functioning again. There is no issue with the doppler,” said director of meteorological department, Bhopal circle, Indrajeet Verma. There are 10 air conditioners around the radar out of which four are not working properly. Officials said they have sent a proposal of Rs 50,000 and soon as it would be sanctioned, ACs will be repaired.
 
 The Rs 22 crore weather doppler radar was set up in Bhopal in 2013. The radar ensures advanced weather prediction, and is helpful in agriculture and disaster management.
