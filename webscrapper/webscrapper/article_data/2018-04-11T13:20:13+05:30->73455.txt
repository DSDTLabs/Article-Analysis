PATNA: Police on Tuesday arrested the private security guard and the driver of the billionaire elderly couple, who were found strangulated inside their residence located under the Town police station area in   on Monday.

 Sadar SDPO Kumar Vir Dhirendra said primary investigations revealed that the guard, Mukesh Kumar, and the driver, Mintu Kumar, were involved in the twin murder.
 
 The bodies of the couple –   (75) and Mandvi Devi (70) – were found lying on sofa inside the hall of their residence. The two were owners of several movable and immovable properties worth crores in Sitamarhi and other districts.
 
 The matter came to light after the couple’s neighbours found the private security guard lying unconscious in the house. The couple’s car and hard disk of CCTV were also taken away by the killers. However, the car was later found abandoned on NH-77 under Bathnaha police station area in the district.
 
 “Mintu fled from the spot after the killings. He was detained from his residence at   in the district,” the SDPO said, adding all the five suspects were known to the elderly couple, who were probably murdered on Sunday night.
 
 “Mintu dropped the killers on NH-77 using the couple’s car. He later abandoned the car on the highway and fled. The guard, on the other hand, got himself injected with a drug to avoid suspicion,” the SDPO said, adding the elderly couple were murdered as the killers intended to grab their huge properties.
 
 SHO of Town police station, Sitamarhi, Anil Kumar Sharma said the couple’s only son Pushkar Anand Prasad had been informed about the incident. “He lives in Sydney, Australia,” the SHO said, adding the bodies of the elderly couple were handed over to their close relatives after autopsies.
