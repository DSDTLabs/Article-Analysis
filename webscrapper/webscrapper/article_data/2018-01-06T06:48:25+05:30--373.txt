NEW DELHI: PM   on Friday used the first function at the newly inaugurated   in the capital to emphasise his government’s commitment to backward districts and urged officials to focus on inclusive and all-round development for transformation of the nation. 

 Modi held a long interaction with the collectors and officers-in-charge (‘prabhari officers’ appointed by the Centre) of the most backward districts on Friday, underlining the fact that upliftment of these districts is a top priority of his government. The Centre will deploy two professional executive assistants to support the collectors of 115 backward districts to help in faster transformation of these areas. 
 
 Modi said the system and officials showed that “it is possible to electrify villages at a record pace and it is possible to build toilets in our cities as well as villages at historic speed”. 
 
 The PM also announced that he would visit the district that will mark maximum progress on April 14, Bhimrao Ambedkar’s birth anniversary, in a bid to encourage a healthy competition among the administrative heads of these districts. 
 
 “On April 14, we celebrate the jayanti of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. Let us devote these coming three months to pioneering innovation in the less developed districts and transform the lives of the poor,” he said. 
 
 The choice of venue —   — for the function is significant given the recent allegations levelled against the Centre of being indifferent to the plight of Dalits following the unrest in Maharashtra.
