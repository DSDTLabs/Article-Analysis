On his 127th birth anniversary, B R Ambedkar is more alive than ever. 

 With   politics and self-assertion gathering force, political parties of all hues declared their commitment to the architect of the Constitution. But the real celebration was among those who lived by his anti-caste thoughts. 
 
 Parliament Street in Delhi was a sea of blue, with DJs playing songs that celebrated moolnivasi and dalit identity, and anti-caste literature being sold. 
 
 
  
 
 “This is our national festival. It reassures us that we have arrived too,” said 23-year-old Pramit Pal, who had travelled from Seelampur, and was wearing an Ambedkar T-shirt with a pair of blue goggles. He took a selfie with the Constitution’s preamble.
 
 Several thousands — veteran activists, families and young people — gathered in cities across the country. 
 
 Noida’s Dalit Prerna Sthal was buzzing with people. In Jalandhar, the “Chetna March” witnessed a much bigger turnout this time. 
 
 Interestingly, a replica of the Bhima Koregaon memorial also figured for the first time in the procession. 
 
 
  
 
 In Parliament Street, there was palpable anger at the Ambedkar statue desecration incidents, and the deaths during the recent Bharat bandh organised by Dalits. 
 
 “So many people were martyred in the Bharat bandh, but we showed our strength. We are organised enough to seek justice, people should know that,” said 20-year-old Rahul Mandrai, a student who also works as a driver.
