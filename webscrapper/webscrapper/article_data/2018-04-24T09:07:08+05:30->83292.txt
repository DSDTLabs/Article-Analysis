DHARAMSHALA: Nearly two weeks after 24 children lost their lives in a road accident near   in   on April 9, the villagers of Malkwal, where the accident took place, started constructing a small temple and performed prayers in memory of the deceased on Monday. 

 While the villagers have already started constructing the temple, the district administration is yet to put in place safety measures at the accident spot.
 
 Erosion on the side of the road had led to the bus falling down a 100-foot-deep gorge. "We are going to construct a temple here. Mass prayers were organised for peace to the departed souls," said Neeraj Kumar, a resident of Malkwal.
 
 Kangra superintendent of police Santosh Patial said they were awaiting the forensic report of the driver.
