 The initial fears we had about our security after the auto drivers of the Tolly gunge-Garia route threatened us as we headed home from the   are now gone.
 
 My mother visited our local police station—Bansdroni—on Thursday night even though the cops had offered to visit our residence. We had identified a couple of auto drivers who stay near our home and who had openly threatened me and my mother on Wednesday night. The police have identified the group leader and we were told not to worry. A case has now been registered at the   station against auto driver Kelo and others for threatening us. We saw Kelo at the police station and we were told he would be questioned.
 
 On Friday morning, my mother and I went to the court to record our confidential statements. This, I was told, was one of the most important elements to ensure conviction. We completed the process without any hiccups. The whole idea was to ensure that the perpetrator goes behind bars and I am happy that the process has begun.
 
 While in court, our neighbours informed us that cops were at our gates. Initially, I wondered why. But the office-in-charge of the Bansdroni police station himself called up and said he had arranged for picketing for our safety. The two cops, we have been informed, will be deployed for 24 hours till things normalize. I am extremely grateful to the police-—from both the police stations—for standing by us when we needed them the most.
