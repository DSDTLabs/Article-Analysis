CHENNAI: Senior   officer and   director general   has finally won her legal battle against the Tamil Nadu government’s “vindictive disciplinary action”.

 The   (CAT) on Tuesday upheld her petition and directed the state to implement its order within one month.
 
 After recommendations from TN in 2012 and 2013, the Centre in February 2014 appointed Archana   additional director. Three reminders later, when there was no response from the state, the Centre on May 7, 2014, ordered Archana to join the post, with a copy to state chief secretary Mohan Chunkath.
 
 Archana handed over charge to the next in command at TN  , informed Chunkath, the home secretary and state police chief and joined CBI in New Delhi on May 8. The same night, Tamil Nadu served her a suspension order and demanded that the Centre send her back. On May 16, the Centre wrote back, refuting the state’s contentions and pointing out its inaction from Feb 7 to May 7. 
 
 In June, TN framed charges against Archana, alleging desertion. Archana appealed to the Centre which in April 2015 quashed the suspension order. The state then moved the the Delhi high court which dismissed it.
 
 Separately, Archana moved the CAT against the TN government’s “vindictive disciplinary action” and triumphed.
