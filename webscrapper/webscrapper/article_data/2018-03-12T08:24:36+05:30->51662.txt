LUDHIANA: Traffic came to a half for 45 minutes around the city bus stand on Sunday afternoon, as members of various teacher unions staged a massive protest against CM Amarinder Singh-led Congress state government.

 The protesting union included teachers of   ( ) and   (RMSA). The protest was staged against the state government’s decision to have a three-year probation period, with a basic pay of Rs 10,800 a month, before regularising the services of contractual teachers in the education department.
 
 Manraj Singh, a member of a union of teachers employed under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, said the state government was in a mood to play foul with teachers and union members by giving them an option to enrol as a permanent employees of education department, with just one-fourth of their present salaries, even after serving for more than 10 years. “The state government should think before implementing the decision. Some of the teachers have been working for many years and have shaped the youth of  ,” he said. “But instead of resolving all issues, they are creating more problems for teachers and now giving them an option to works on Rs 10,000 salaries, instead of their present Rs 45,000/month salaries.”
 
 Another protesting teacher,  , questioned how could a teacher feed their entire family at such a salary. “Look at the expenditures these days. How can a family survive in just Rs 10,000?” he said. 
 
 Another protester,  , a computer teacher in a government school, said the state government had earlier formed a sub-committee to resolve the decision under the guidance of state education minister, local bodies minister, and finance minister, but it had passed the decision to regularise services with a “paltry” basic pay. “We had taken up the matter with the principal secretary, but to no avail,” he said.
