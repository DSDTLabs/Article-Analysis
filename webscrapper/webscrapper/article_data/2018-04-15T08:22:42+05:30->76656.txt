CHENNAI: Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal has directed the   ( ) to pay a compensation of Rs 3.35 lakh along with interest to the relatives of a 76-year-old man, who was killed in an accident involving the transport corporation’s bus in   seven years ago.

 According to petitioners, the accident occurred on May 3, 2011, when S Devadoss, a security guard at an apartment complex, tried to board an MTC bus at the Ration shop bus stop on LB Road, Thiruvanmiyur. They stated that the bus’s driver drove in a rash and negligent manner, which resulted in the elderly man slipping off the bus’s foot board. The subsequent fall resulted in fatal injuries leading to the death of the septuagenarian.
 
 
 The petitioners, D   and D  , daughter and son of the deceased, sought a compensation of Rs5 lakh from MTC. However, the MTC, in its counter petition denied the allegation that their driver drove in a rash and negligent manner and argued that their management is in no way liable to pay any compensation.
 
 Principal special judge  , who perused the documents from both the sides, ruled in favour of the petitioners. “No evidence is available to prove that the driver drove in a normal speed except for his testimony,” the judge observed and directed the transport corporation to pay a sum of Rs3.35 lakh as compensation, with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from 2011. The son and daughter of the deceased are entitled to half the compensation amount, Rs1.67 lakh each.
