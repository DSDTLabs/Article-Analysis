NEW DELHI: Chief Minister   has accused CAG of becoming a political tool in the hand of the Centre. Reacting to the CAG audits that accused the government of having wasted public funds, Kejriwal said: “Earlier the CAG used to unearth 2G scam and irregularities in power companies. We are disappointed that the CAG is doing politics. We know why the CAG is doing this. I think CAG has been named in some wrongdoings which is why it is doing this.”

 Kejriwal said CAG should restrict itself to carrying out audits and leave politics to politicians. “We had requested CAG to conduct a 10-year audit of the Delhi Commission of Women, but instead it audited only the two years of Swati Maliwal. What is the friendship between CAG and Sheila Dikshit? What is the friendship between CAG and BJP? I want to ask CAG to stop doing politics and do just audits,” the CM said.
 
 Responding to the observation that the government had spent the taxpayers’ money in false advertising, much of which had been spent on giving ads outside Delhi, Kejriwal asked if there were any rules to say that a government cannot advertise outside the state. “We have ensured ease of doing business in Delhi and would like businessmen in Mumbai to know about it. We don't spend crores of rupees on small programmes to talk about our achievements but inform people through advertisements. The Centre is giving ads in foreign countries. Haryana government’s ads are visible all across Delhi as are those of the UP government. Why isn’t the CAG auditing all these governments? We will continue to give ads outside Delhi,” said Kejriwal.
 
 He added that he had written to CAG, asking it not audit only the advertisements of   but also those of other states. “However, CAG has chosen to focus only on Delhi government,” he said.
