NEW DELHI: Any refugee crisis impacts the host nation in a number of ways, placing sudden pressures on its land and economy. Most refugee crises break out in developing nations and the neighbouring countries that need to take the responsibility for providing relief to the fleeing   are also more-or-less equally poor. 

 Here, countries whose land area, population demographics and economy are most impacted by refugee influx.
 
 
 
 According to UNHCR, there are over 65 million displaced people in the world. There are 80 countries that host over 10,000 refugees or stateless persons each. 
 
 LEBANON | With over 1 million refugees, mostly Syrian, the west Asian country has the highest density of refugee population 
 
 JORDAN | Another major host of Syrian refugees following the civil war 
 
 RWANDA | Itself with a gruesome history of civil war, the central is home to people who have fled Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi during and after series of conflicts in the 1990s
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Typically, refugees compete for the lowest-paying local jobs.
 
 This can create tension in countries where resources are already scarce, often leading to anti-refugee politics at the very least.
 
 If allowed to integrate however, refugees contribute positively to local economies, several surveys/ studies have shown Latvia and Estonia too have high proportion of stateless persons â€” mostly citizens of former USSR who possess no citizenship and are issued non-citizen/alien passport, and have limited rights.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Chad, which hosts refugees from Sudan, where civil war raged for two decades, and Central African Republic, that witnessed conflicts in the 2000s, has the highest burden of refugee per million dollars of its GDP.
 
 Similarly, Uganda, with refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Somalia, and South Sudan, with refugees from Sudan, are overly burdened.
