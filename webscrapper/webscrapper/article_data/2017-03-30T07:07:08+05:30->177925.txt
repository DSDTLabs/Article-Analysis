 I have been a resident of R K Nagar for the past 40 years and I know the people and every street in the area. I know all their problems too. Unlike other candidates, I do door-todoor campaign and it helps me meet every voter.
 
 
 First and foremost is clean drinking water and sanitation facility. Trans port facility is pretty bad. The constituency needs a bus stand, train connectivity, playgrounds, parks, and place for garbage segregation and disposal. I promise to provide all these to the voters.
 
 
 People were carried away by the promises made by the AIADMK. Every Tuesday, people used to assemble at designated places to give representations to government officials for multifarious reasons. The illiterate among them had spent money to get their representations written by others.Some others had taken leave and stood in queue thinking that being chief minister's constituency, help would be forthcoming without any delay. But none of those representations were attended to by the AIADMK government.
