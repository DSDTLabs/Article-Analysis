KOLKATA: While agreeing there has been a rise in incursions across Line of Actual Control (LAC) by People’s Liberation   ( ) of late, Lt Gen Abhay Krishna, GOC-in-C, Eastern Command, on Monday said the Indian Army had succeeded in dealing with the situation effectively. 

 In Arunachal Pradesh’s Tuting, the Chinese were allowed to take back road building equipment from the Indian side of LAC only after they apologized for the transgression and promised not to try to cross over again, the Eastern Army commander said.
 
 “There has been status quo at   since August 28, 2017. If one goes by statistics, there has been a slight rise in the number of incursions in recent times but we have given it back to them and they now realise that we are well prepared. At Doklam, we have drawn the red-line clearly and told them not to cross it. So far as Tuting is concerned, all areas can’t have adequate infrastructure. But the Army doesn’t require roads to reach a place. We are trained to smash through forests and hills....We have all areas under surveillance,” Lt Gen Krishna said.
 
 The Army commander laid a wreath at Vijay Smarak at   on Army Day. “On this day in 1949, Field Marshal K M Cariappa (then a Lt Gen) took over as the first Indian commander-in-chief of the Indian Army,” he said. 
 
 On the occasion,   CM   greeted the Army. “On Army Day, my salute to all Army personnel for their exemplary sense of duty to the nation,” she tweeted.
