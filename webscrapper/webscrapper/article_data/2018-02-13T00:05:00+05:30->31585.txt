In a bid to raise awareness about the plight of   in the country, independent filmmaker Anshul Sinha screened his film, Mitti — Back to the Roots, recently at two educational institutes in the city. The 120-minute long   covers about 20 different issues that farmers in the country face, says the Hyderabadi filmmaker. Anshul, who is a recipient of over 100 awards at 40 film festivals, has been vigorously promoting his films through roads shows and screenings. “The news of farmers in India committing suicide made me take up this subject. I did research in four states — Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Punjab — to learn about the agrarian crisis. I even approached the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA) to learn agricultural science,” he says.

 The film, says Anshul, tries to highlight the agrarian crisis and provides solutions to agricultural scientists. But why screen it at educational institutes? “We are doing roadshows and are screening the film in apartment complexes. So, why shouldn’t we screen it for   students? It is important that we spread the message. It is important that students learn about the plight of farmers. They must know how and where they get the food on their plates,” says Anshul, adding that screening the film in colleges has generated positive results. “After the screening at one of the colleges, one person agreed to dub the film in Kannada. What better way to reach out to the masses than this,” Anshul sums up.
