 The nomination of Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) two other candidates - Sanjay Singh and Sushil Gupta - for the biennial elections to the Rajya Sabha were approved on Saturday.
 
 The scrutiny of nomination of ND Gupta was deferred following Congress complaint with the returning officer Nidhi Srivastava - its second complaint - saying that Gupta had not resigned as chairman of the audit committee of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) Trust.
 
 In a letter to the returning officer, Delhi Congress chief   had said that   was appointed as the chairman from September 8, 2015 and "Gupta has not resigned from the post till date".
 
 First, the Congress had alleged that Gupta had been appointed as trustee of the NPS on March 30, 2015. Following the complaint, the Returning Officer had written a letter to Gupta.
 
 In his detailed reply, Gupta referred to various exemptions under the office of profit and also said that he had resigned from the Trust on December 29, 2017.
 
 Three Rajya Sabha vacancies had come up in Delhi due to the end of tenure of Congress members later in January.
 
 AAP is set to win the three seats due to its majority in the Delhi assembly.
 
 The last date of withdrawal of candidature is Monday.
