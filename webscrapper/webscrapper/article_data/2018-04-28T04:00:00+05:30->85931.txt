Rajkot: A fishing boat from Mangrol was hijacked by Pakistan Maritime Security Agency off Jakhau coast near the international marine border between India and Pakistan on Thursday night. “There were five fishermen on board the boat,” secretary, National Fish Workers’ Forum, Manish Lodhari said there are 550 Indian fishermen languishing in Pakistani jails.

 Last month, PMSA had apprehended 70 Gujarat fishermen and seized their nine boats from near the International Maritime Border Line (IMBL) off Kutch coast.
 
 In February, the PMSA had abducted 42 fishermen from Gujarat and seized eight of their boats. Earlier, in January, the Pakistan agency had arrested 17 fishermen for fishing illegally in Pakistan’s territorial waters. The PMSA had apprehended 400 fishermen and seized around 65 of their boats last year.
