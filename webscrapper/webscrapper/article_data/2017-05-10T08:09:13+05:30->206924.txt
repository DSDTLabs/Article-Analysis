PUNE: The   is set to have a separate   and machinery to crack down on illegal constructions. At present, 18,000   are under its scanner.

 New PMRDA chief   on Tuesday said a separate action plan will be drawn to initiate action against these such structures. He added that the PMRDA has also initiated a “land mapping pattern” software that will provide it with real-time data on the use pattern of use of land in the area.
 
 “The software is ready and it will provide a geographic information system (GIS) mapping of the entire area and also data on if the buildings are approved. Work on it has been on for the last 10 months. With the technology, there will not be any need to send out people to check and re-check such constructions. The launch of the project will be announced soon,” he said.
 
 With the state keen on amending the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act to allow legalising of unauthorised buildings by paying a premium or a compounding fee,   said they would have to keep a check on these structures. The new rule will be applicable for buildings constructed before December 2015.
