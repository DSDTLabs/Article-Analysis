MYSURU: Gram panchayat (GP) member Mariswamy, who told   during a roadshow in Chamundeshwari segment on Wednesday that he is backing the JD(S) and not the CM, was heckled by villagers minutes after the   leader left the village.

 When Mariswamy was speaking to a Kannada TV news channel in the afternoon at his Hale Kesare village, some youths supporting the CM gathered at the place and objected to his behaviour. “How can you speak arrogantly when a CM has come to our village? You have brought bad name to our village,” one of them told him.
 
 Mariswamy was taken aback and kept quiet and cut short his interaction with the news channel.
 
 Earlier, during the roadshow, Mariswamy had told the CM: “JD(S) has promised to make a Dalit the deputy chief minister. The Congress denied deputy CM’s post to Dalits. So, I will support JD(S).”
 
 Nanjappa, Mariswamy’s colleague in Siddalingapura GP, said Mariswamy need not have spoken “so rudely” to the CM.
 
 
 
 
 CM Siddaramaiah said on Wednesday that   and JD(S) have entered into a tacit agreement to take on Congress in many constituencies, including Chamundeshwari and Badami.
 
 He said denial of BJP ticket to BY Vijayendra from Varuna will not make any difference to Congress because it would win even if state BJP chief BS   were to contest from the segment.
