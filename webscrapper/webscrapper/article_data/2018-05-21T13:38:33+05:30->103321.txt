MEERUT: In a strategic shift from the issue of development, BJP MP  , an accused in the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, on Sunday said that the grand alliance had made Azam Khan, a “key conspirator in riots”, as its start campaigner.
 
  Talking to TOI, Balyan claimed that he was “instigated” to raise the issue after a senior RLD leader blamed BJP for “masterminding the riots”.
  
 “A senior RLD leader had recently blamed BJP for the riots. He also claimed that if the grand alliance candidate,  , wins in Kairana, they will help in striking a compromise in riots cases involving Muslims,” the MP said.
  
 Meanwhile,   retaliated with another scathing attack. “Azam Khan hasn’t yet campaigned in Kairana. He never came here during the riots. All this hate mongering is unfounded. Balyan is himself an accused in riots cases,” Sanjay Lathar, SP’s in-charge for Kairana bypoll, said.
  
 Balyan, however, maintained that BJP has been projecting the revamped law and order situation to the public to seek their vote. “We have turned around things in Kairana. Law and order was a major issue and it has been addressed to a great extent. We are going to the people with this message,” he said.
