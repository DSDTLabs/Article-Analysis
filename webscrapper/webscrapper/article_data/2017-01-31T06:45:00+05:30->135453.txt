BHATINDA: Aam Aadmi Party MP   has refuted the reports of being under the influence of liquor and falling down during an election meeting at Moga on Saturday night.

 Mann, who is contesting against SAD president   from Jalalabad, said, “I was not inebriated as is being claimed. There was a big rush of people who had surrounded me and kept on shrieking so I could not speak for over five minutes only because of immense love of the crowd for me. I had not fallen down due to liquor and it is a totally false allegation.”
 
 The MP was mobbed by people at an election rally at Moga and reportedly fell down while trying to address the participants. He could not speak for over five minutes as he was surrounded by the people and he was throwing flying kisses to those around him and slipped while leaving the venue, according to news reports.
 
 There were reports alleging that he was under influence of liquor, a charge Mann denied vehemently. On Monday, he also released a two-minute video and blamed a vernacular daily for wrongly reporting the incidents without checking the facts or taking his version.
