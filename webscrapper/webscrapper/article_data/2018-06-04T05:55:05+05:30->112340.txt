NAGPUR: Passion, willingness to work hard, investing time in a particular idea and meticulous execution with adequate funding are the factors necessary to become successful entrepreneurs, said  , founder of General Eduinfra, at Jaivik Hall of Orange City Hospital and Research Centre, on Saturday.

 
 Guiding youngsters at a seminar on starts-ups, organized by Saraswati Vidyalaya Alumni Association, Chand, a chartered accountant and a mentor, said that the mindset of people is needed to be changed as the number of start-ups in India is much less when compared to the   and Japan. Most youngsters fail to set up own businesses as they lack funds. It is the responsibility of parents to support their children when venture out, he remarked.
 
 “There are many sources of funding like angel investors, venture capital and bank loans. Using these resources wisely decides the future of start-ups. There is no gain without risk is the mantra every aspiring entrepreneurs should keep in mind,” Chand said.
 
 Chand blamed the present education system for killing the innate creativity children possess. Development of product or service, looking for constant improvement and employing talented people in a marketing set-up are necessary for achieving the desired results, he added.
 
 According to him, risk taking capacity is what separates an entrepreneur from the rest. “If you truly believe in doing something concrete in life, put all your efforts into it and keep fighting negative thoughts to succeed.” 
 
 Young entrepreneurs should keep studying what customers need and identify problem areas so that they could get new ideas and solve them by applying creative ideas in real time, Chand said. Observing how their competitors function and raising standard are key to success, he added.
