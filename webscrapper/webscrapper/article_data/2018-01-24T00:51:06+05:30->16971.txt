Ajmer: Congress state spokesperson Pratap Singh Khachariyawas on Tuesday alleged that police has booked 500 Congress workers under probationary law but not arrested any BJP worker.

 The Congress took out a procession of ‘gas cylinder funeral’ from Raja Cycle to Ghandi Bhavan to protest against the hike in LPG price.
 
 He said that 500 Congress workers have been booked under the probationary law as police doubt that they can disturb peace and are making rounds of executive magistrate courts.
 
 Khachariyawas said that Congress visited different polling booths and found many of them sensitive and reported to the election office but they are not doing anything on the issue. Meanwhile, Union minister of state for law and justice and the ministry of corporate affairs P P Choudhary told media that BJP is seeking votes on the basis of work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Vasundhara Raje. He said that the major work done by BJP in last four years was to remove corruption in governance and provide LPG to down-trodden sections of society.
