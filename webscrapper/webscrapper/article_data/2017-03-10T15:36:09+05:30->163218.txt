PANAJI: With the election commission’s ban on   making it difficult for psephologists to make any sort of prediction about the results of the February 4 assembly election, anxious netas are turning to divination for solace. In a trend that transcends religious lines,   are being paid anything between Rs 10,000 and Rs 1 lakh for a peek at political fortunes.

 As the netas would like to keep their consultations a secret, they are visiting soothsayers in Karnataka and Maharashtra. Belagavi and Mangaluru in Karnataka, and Banda, Malvan and Kolhapur in Maharashtra are the most frequented locations.
 
 “We visited the same astrologer before the election to seek his guidance. Now I went to find out whether I will win the polls,” an   told TOI on condition of anonymity.
 
 Besides human intervention, divine intercession is being keenly sought at every leading house of worship in the run-up to counting day, March 11.
 
 Sources close to a candidate from Tiswadi said that the candidate had visited the Damodar temple at Zambaulim to find out whether he will win, but did not reveal what the ‘god’ had told the candidate via the ‘prasad’.
 
 Another candidate from the Bicholim taluka visited an astrologer in Mangaluru to learn about his prospects. Sources close to the candidate said a win has been predicted for the candidate. 
 
 Sources present with another candidate during his visit to an astrologer, said during the interaction the astrologer sometimes tells politicians what mistakes they made and the reasons for their defeat. 
 
 “The last time around, an astrologer from Mangaluru predicted defeat and that is exactly what happened,” sources close to the politician said, and added that this time around, though, he has predicted victory for the candidate. 
 
 Thirty-one days ago, as many as 259 candidates contested the election to the 40-member Goa state legislative assembly.
