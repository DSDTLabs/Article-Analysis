Nagpur: In a setback to MLA Krishna Khopde’s sons, the Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court on Wednesday, stayed the ongoing trial in the Cloud 7 bar case allegedly involving them and directed the government to reply on dropping of attempt to murder charge against the siblings, within six weeks. 
 
 A division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and   issued notices to the respondents, including Abhilash and Rohit Khopde. The duo was booked under various IPC Sections — 326, 427, 143, 145, 147 and many others. 
  
 The HC’s directives came while hearing a plea by Cloud 7 bar owner   through counsel Mir Nagman Ali accusing the Khopde brothers of attacking him with hockey stick along with their friends that left him with serious head injuries. 
  
 The petitioner contend that when he lodged a case against Khopde brothers and their friends, an attempt to murder charge under Section 307 was specifically mentioned, but when charge-sheet was filed, it was apparently dropped under obvious political pressure. 
  
 HC’s last chance to ABWI to reply on dogs rehab 
  
 Upset over Animal Welfare Board of India’s (ABWI) failure to reply on steps taken to rehabilitate dogs serving in the bomb disposal and detection units of armed forces, after their retirement, the high court granted it a last chance and also issued a bailable warrant to its secretary based here. The court was hearing a sou Motu plea based on TOI report of June 22 last year, exposing absence of measures for rehabilitation of canines serving in the bomb disposal and detection units. It had appointed Ravi Sanyal as amicus curiae who submitted TOI report highlighting plight of one such canine named ‘Reno’ and lack of rehabilitation plans or services rendered to such sniffer dogs serving in the Railway Protection Force.
