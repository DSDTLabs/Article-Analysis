BHOPAL: Two cousin brothers abducted a 17-year-old girl from Gandhi Nagar locality and took her to an under construction building in Eintkhedi locality where they attempted to rape her. 

 When the girl resisted to their advances, one of the accused attacked her with a knife and injured her. She managed to run away after jumping off the first floor of the building and later reported the matter to Eintkhedi police where a Zero FIR was lodged on her complaint and the case was later transferred to Gandhi Nagar police station.
 
 Investigation officer ASI Laeeq Khan said that the survivor hails from Ujjain district and presently stays alone at Nayapura locality in Gandhi Nagar. She left her husband and her two-year-old daughter resides with her in-laws. She works as sanitation worker at a private hospital.
 
 She told police that she met accused Shoaib alias Michael, 19, a resident of Chandbad, at the hospital and both exchanged cell phone numbers. They used to talk over the phone occasionally. Around 6.30 pm on Thursday, Michael called the girl and asked her to meet him for coffee. When she agreed, he reached her house along with his cousin Salman, 19, a resident of Abbas Nagar. Both took her on their bike to a roadside dhaba at Acharpura Bypass Road in Eintkhedi and had tea.
 
 Later, they lured her and took her to an under-construction building where they forced her to make sexual relations with them. When she denied, the accused Michael took out a knife and attacked her injuring her waist and neck. She managed to free herself from their clutches after jumping off the first floor of the building, but sustained injuries. 
 
 Later on Friday, she reported the matter at Eintkheri police station where a zero FIR was lodged and the case was transferred to Gandhi Nagar police station. Police have registered a case under relevant sections of IPC and POCSO Act against the accused and arrested them.
