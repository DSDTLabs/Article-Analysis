The bench stated that: “No one would like to enter a manhole for cleaning purposes, but there are people who are forced to undertake such hazardous jobs with the hope that at the end of the day they will be able to make some money and feed their family.” Taking a strong view of the deaths of manual scavengers, the Delhi high court in August 2017 summoned the heads of all civic bodies in the capital.
