HYDERABAD: The   will decide on February 6 the need to have an administrator for   (HCA) to oversee the Test between India and Bangladesh on Feb 9. 

 After hearing at length various claims and counter-claims as to who really represents the HCA, the bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Shameem Akther made it clear that it would confine itself to the question of administrator for now and all other issues would be decided in the final hearing on the PIL filed by advocate M Govind Reddy seeking HCA reforms.
 
 In Friday’s hearing, there were several lawyers representing sections of HCA: Senior counsel Surender Rao appeared for HCA’s senior VP   claiming that Goud was the acting HCA president; senior counsel Vedula Venkata Ramana appeared for HCA and said that there was no need for an administrator as a BCCI general manager was there to oversee Feb 9 match; another senior counsel   appeared for another VP S K Agarwal and opposed court interference; and B Vijaysen Reddy, counsel for HCA secretary John Manoj, too opposed having an administrator and told the court that there were 13 office-bearers with collective responsibility. 
 
 But senior advocates S Niranjan Reddy for the petitioner and D V Sitarama Murthy for a functionary from   sought the court’s intervention. Another counsel also appearing for HCA told the court that the alleged amendment of HCA by-laws was rejected by the registrar of societies.
