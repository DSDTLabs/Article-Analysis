 Chandigarh: The rain on Thursday came as a respite from the scorching heat but led to waterlogging and traffic jams on many roads in the city. People were stuck for hours on the main connecting roads as rain brought the city to a standstill.
 
 Traffic on the Sector 8 road leading to ISBT 17 derailed the schedule of CTU buses travelling across the Tricity, as they were stuck for hours. People could not take cars and two-wheelers on flooded roads as water level reached the brim of car gates and tyres on the Sector 8-9 road. 
 
 People were seen walking to ISBT 17 to catch buses as traffic was blocked in sectors 17, 34 and 22 for an hour. “I waited for half an hour when the bus was stuck in traffic. But finally, I had to walk to Sector 22 market from JW Marriott as there was no scope of the bus moving for an hour or so”, said Kanwal Preet, a resident of Sector 34.
 
 Sectors 29, 31 and Industrial Area Chowk were choked as water accumulated on all sides, leading to a traffic jam lasting about two hours. In Industrial Area, the road outside Elante Mall and Sector 36 traffic was blocked for about 2 to 3 hours.
 
 Traffic was blocked for an hour at the Zirakpur main road connecting to Chandigarh during the initial hours of rain. “It took me an hour to reach Sector 26 from Zirakpur in the morning at around 10 and I never came across such bad condition of roads during the rain before”, said Sakshi Mittal, a resident of Hallo Majra. 
 
 Vehicles queued up for 2 kilometres on the main roads of Sector 14, connecting with UIET and Sector 15. Street vendors were worst hit as they had to walk through flooded roads with water at waist-level. The two-hour traffic jam from PGI to Sector 10 road extending to Madhya Marg slowed vehicles down.
