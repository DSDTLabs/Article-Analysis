MUMBAI: The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) have decided to revoke the   ban on 30  , including some  , imposed last year. The two-year ban on Zomato, one of the leading restaurant search firms, was also lifted at a recent meeting of the   (AIPC) of   held in Kanpur. 

 The IITs had barred these firms from participating in the placement process after they revoked their offers or deferred joining dates. The decision to lift the ban was taken as students continued to show keen interest in start-ups. With fewer firms visiting the newer IITs, they could not afford to have a blanket ban on companies, said an AIPC member. While the ban on one of the firms (Crayon Data India Pvt Ltd) was lifted last year, some of the other banned start-ups have already shut shop, said the member.
 
 The banned firms also included healthcare start-up Portea and Indus Insight, which are preferred by students.
 
 “Many students, interested in setting up their own business, want to work in start-ups and understand how they function. We do not want them to lose out on opportunities,” said Kaustubha Mohanty, AIPC convenor. He added though some of the banned companies had approached him, it was decided to lift the ban on all firms.
 
 Placements at newer IITs have been a concern for the AIPC for some time now. “Only about 60 per cent of the batch in these institutes is getting placed. Bigger firms prefer to pick candidates from the established IITs,” said an AIPC member.
 
 While banning firms on campus for flouting norms has been a regular feature at IITs, it was the first time a decision was taken to ban a large number of companies at one go last year.
