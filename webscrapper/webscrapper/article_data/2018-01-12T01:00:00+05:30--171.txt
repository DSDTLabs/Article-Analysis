GAYA: The   district administration will present the aerial view of Gandhi Maidan encroachments before a Patna high court bench comprising Justice AK Tripathi and Justice Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, on Friday. 

 The bench is hearing a contempt petition filed by a Gaya-based citizen group Pratinjya for alleged government move to regularise the encroachments/unauthorised construction on the maidan land. As per estimate, nearly 500 lakh square feet area of the 72 acre maidan has come under encroachment and unauthorised concrete structures have come up.
 
 Earlier, on December 15, while hearing the contempt petition, the HC, according to lawyer Brajesh Kumar had asked the DM to explain the anomaly that permits senior officials to live in sprawling bungalows spread over several acres of land and allowing unauthorised constructions to come up on the only major open space available to the Gayaites. The maidan, it may be recalled is regarded as the town’s lungs as the highly congested city is almost devoid of open space.
 
 According to information provided by the Gaya Municipal Corporation to RTI activist Brajnandan Pathak, the Gaya DM's official residence is spread over 14.77 acre. The market value of the land is estimated to be Rs 472 crore. The divisional commissioner lives in a relatively smaller bungalow spread over 9.74 acre. But on account of its location, the market price of the land for commissioner’s bungalow is almost the same as that of the DM.
 
 All eyes are now fixed on the HC to provide succour to Gayaites desperately looking for sources of fresh air.
 
 While disposing of the original writ petition in 2013, the HC directed the chief secretary to address the issue and take effective steps. As per the petitioner's complaint, almost nothing has been done to remove encroachments rather a move is on to regularise the encroachments. The high court came down heavily on the government on the regularisation issue.
