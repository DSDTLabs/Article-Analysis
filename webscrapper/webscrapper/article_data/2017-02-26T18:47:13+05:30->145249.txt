Musical duo   tried to make no-pants dress code while receiving their first ever trophy for 'Stressed Out' at the 59th annual Grammys. 

 After winning the award in the best Pop duo/group performance category, the members Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun immediately got up from their seats and removed their pants, choosing to walk up to the stage in their boxers. 
 
 "This story, it starts in Columbus, Ohio, it was a few years ago and it was before Josh and I were able to make money playing music," Tyler said during his speech. 
 
  
  
 "I called him up, and I said, 'Hey Josh, want to come over to my rental house and watch the Grammys? As we were watching, we noticed every single one of us was in our underwear, and seriously, Josh said to me, and we were no one at the time, he turned to me and he said, 'If we ever go to the Grammys, if we ever win a Grammy, we should receive it just like this'," he added. 
 
 The 28-year-old singer's speech earned laughs and applause from many stars sitting in audience. 
 
 
  
 Tyler concluded his speech with an inspirational message for all the budding artistes, saying, "I want everyone at home whose watching to know that you can be next. So watch out, OK, because anyone from anywhere can do anything." 
 
 Twenty One Pilots defeated The Chainsmokers and Halsey's 'Closer', Lukas Graham's '7 Years', Rihanna and Drake's 'Work' and Sia and Sean Paul's 'Cheap Thrills'.
