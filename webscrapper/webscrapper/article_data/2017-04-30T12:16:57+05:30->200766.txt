  :  , daughter-in-law of freedom fighter  , had never imagined that an opportunity to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and being felicitated by him would turn into her worst nightmare. 

 After seeing her son Babula in the ICU of   medical college and hospital, she is regretting her family's decision to come down to Bhubaneswar from her village in   to attend the felicitation ceremony.
 
 Standing outside the ICU, Sujata stole a glance into the room where his ailing son Babula is recuperating. 
 
 "I am not able to talk to him as he is not conscious. But doctors have told us that his health condition is improving and I trust them. I am praying to God to make my son healthy so that I can take him back home," said Sujata. 
 
 Researcher Anil Dhir brought Sujata and Surendra and other family members to Cuttack to meet the ailing Babula.
 
 "It is heart-wrenching to see my son in this condition. He was not suffering from any disease and neither had he had any kidney related problem. Before coming to Bhubaneswar he was completely fine. I don't know how he became so sick," Sujata added. 
 
 However, she refused to blame anyone for Babula's condition or for the pain her family had to undergo in the past few days. "I don't want to say anything on this issue," she said. 
 
 Babula is the eldest of the four sons and worked as a street vendor.
 
  "I will never go to Bhubaneswar to attend any ceremony in the future," Sujata exclaimed. 
 
 Doctors have meanwhile claimed Babula's condition is improving. "He is responding well to the treatment and he is in a stable condition now," said Dr Siddartha Das, principal of SCB. 
 
 Babula had gone missing on April 17 from Bhubaneswar railway station and was recovered by the police 10 days later, lying near a drain in a semi-conscious state at the   locality of Bhubaneswar. 
 
 Babula's aunt Renuka said the family got separated at Bhubaneswar railway station as they could not locate which train to board to return home.
