WASHINGTON:  's moon Charon may be significantly reducing the loss of atmosphere of the icy dwarf planet by creating a shield and redirecting much of the solar wind away , according to a new study.

 Pluto's relationship with Charon is one of the more unusual interactions in the   due to the moon's size and proximity . It is more than half of Pluto's diameter and orbits only 19,312 kilometres away . To put that into perspective, picture our moon three times closer to Earth, and as large as Mars, the researchers said.
 
 The study by researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology , US, provides additional insight into this relationship and how it affects the continuous stripping of Pluto's atmosphere by solar wind.
 
 When Charon is positioned between the Sun and Pluto, the research indicates, the moon can significantly reduce atmospheric loss. “Charon does not always have its own atmosphere. But when it does, it creates a shield for Pluto and redirects much of the solar wind around and away ,“ said Carol Paty , a Georgia Tech associate professor.
 
 When Charon does not have an atmosphere, or when it is behind or next to Pluto, then Charon has only a minor effect on the interaction of the solar wind with Pluto.
