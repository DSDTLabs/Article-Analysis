INDORE: Four doctors, who were suspended by the Medical Council of India after being found guilty of clinical drug trial, told the Indore bench of high court that the   had not specified even a single ground for taking action against them.

 The submission was made in four of the eight petitions, filed before two different benches. Justice Rohit Arya ordered for the petitions to be listed analogously for the next hearing which will be held after summer vacations. 
 
 The submission regarding the MCI’s report was made before the court through a rejoinder submitted by Dr  , Dr Abhay Paliwal, Dr VS Pal and Dr  . They claimed that the MCI had not mentioned any provisions violated by the doctors and had not submitted the deliberations by the ethical committee. 
 
 The MCI, however, has said that procedure has been followed. It was a case of clinical drug trial and, therefore, the challenged order has rightly been passed, claimed the medical council. 
 
 “The court had also directed MCI to submit on record the deliberations of the ethical committee which decided the matter. However, it was not submitted by them,” advocate Amol Shrivastava counsel for the four doctors said.
 
 The doctors who had been suspended by the MCI were Dr Rastogi, Dr Pal, Dr Sardesai, Dr Paliwal, Dr Anil Bharani, Dr Ashi Patel, Dr  , and Dr Hemant Jain. 
 
 The MCI, through its order dated July 26, 2017 had removed the doctors from the Indian Medical Register for 3 months as they were found to have been violating Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002. 
 
 The court had granted a stay on the operations of the order through an interim order passed in September 2017.
