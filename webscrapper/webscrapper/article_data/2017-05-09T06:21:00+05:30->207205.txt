NAGPUR: The   (SCSI) is demanding equal travel concessions as the thalassaemia and haemophilia patients for the   (SCD) as well in the railways. The society claims all these being blood disorders, the concession to patients suffering from any of the three diseases should be the same.

 Sampat Ramteke, president of the society working for the cause of   patients in Vidarbha and Central India for over two decades, told TOI that as per the GR dated April 18, 2012, sickle cell patients have been granted 50% concessions for travelling for treatment to any government hospital and back in sleeper class, AC Chair Car, AC-3T and AC-2T.
 
 The thalassaemia patients get much higher concession of 75% in sleeper class, first and AC-3T, Chair Car, AC-First and 2T. The thalassaemia patient also are allowed an escort whereas there is no such provision for the sickle cell patients. “Why this discrimination between patients of different blood disorders? Why the difference between AC classes allowed? Patients (a majority of whom are in Vidarbha and Central India) suffering from these diseases are poor and would not normally travel in AC. We would be happy even if concession is given just for sleeper class,” said Ramteke.
 
 He also stressed these concessions could be given directly by the station masters. He said in fact very few sickle cell patients were even aware of the concession and hence were not availing it. “The GR said government (the railway board) should give wide publicity through various media at regular intervals. Zonal railways may arrange to send specimen copies of certificate to government recognized hospitals and advise them about the concession. Health departments of concerned state may also be advised in this regard. Unfortunately, railway board has not done anything like that,” Ramteke said.
