Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday dismissed a plea that wanted to stop the release of the film titled ‘Akilandakodi Prammanda Nayagan’.

 Advocate Palanikumar from Ramanathapuram district filed a petition. The petitioner’s counsel said that there was an apprehension that the movie would cause disrespect to Goddess Andal. 
 
 In this situation, director Ragavendra Rao and producer S Durai Murugan of Joshika Films have dubbed their Telugu movie in Tamil as ‘Akilandakodi Prammanda Nayagan. The director and producer had been advertising the film’s release on social media by using the photograph of Vairamuthu and by mentioning that the poet realised the greatness of Andal and he sensitised her. Actually, the poet had no connection with the movie. 
 
 The government counsel told the court that the petitioner did not raise objection. Following it, the court dismissed the plea.
