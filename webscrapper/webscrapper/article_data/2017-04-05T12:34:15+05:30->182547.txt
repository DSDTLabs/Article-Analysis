IDUKKI: The Congress on Tuesday said it will not support those who have encroached the government land in Munnar. Addressing an UDF-led agitation in Munnar, KPCC interim president   said an explanation would be sought from party secretary A K Mani, who attended a meet organized to protest the eviction move. 

 Taking a dig at V S Achuthanandan, the 93-year-old chairman of the state administrative reforms commission, Hassan said the veteran Marxist had not yet visited Munnar, which exposed his double standards. Hassan also pointed out that power minister M M Mani was supporting S Rajendran, MLA, who had "encroached" the KSEB land at Ekka Nagar.
