BHUBANESWAR: A day after the Biju   sought the resignation of the party's suspended MP   from the   for allegedly lying in his election affidavit, Baijayant on Saturday dismissed the allegation as 'bizarre' and dared BJD leaders to either move the   or the Orissa high court on the issue.

 The BJD on Friday demanded Baijayant's resignation stating that the industrialist-politician had concealed information on receiving a salary from Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys Limited (IMFA) - a company controlled by Baijayant and his family - in the affidavit that he had submitted while filing nomination papers for the LS polls in 2014.
 
 "Some experienced and educated MLAs have made some bizarre allegations," Baijayant said in Puri where he visited the Jagannath Temple and Biju Patnaik's memorial. 
 
 The four-time MP was suspended from the BJD on January 24. On Saturday he said he had faced such an action because he spoke the bitter truth in his party's interest. "Had   (Biju Patnaik) been with us, he would have welcomed my views. People who consider Biju babu as their ideal would never remain silent," he said.
 
 A statement issued by Baijayant's political secretary, Jyoti Prakash Ghose, quoted Baijayant as saying that the party was running smoothly, but indiscipline had crept in three or four years ago. "Some people took the party in their control and have been using it to further their interests," the statement said. Baijayant has been raising the issue of bureaucratic highhandedness in the running of BJD's affairs for quite a while now.
