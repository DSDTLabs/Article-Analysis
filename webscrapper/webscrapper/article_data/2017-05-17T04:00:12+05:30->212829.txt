NAGPUR: Guardian minister   on Tuesday asked   (MADC) to train the Mihan project affected persons (PAPs) on lines of Mahagenco. The minister gave these directions to   vice-chairman and managing director Suresh Kakani during a meeting in Mumbai.

 Bawankule told Kakani that the government had recently given Rs100 crore for rehabilitation of Khapri village. However, as the   officials did not have administrative powers, the funds remained unspent. He asked Kakani to come to Nagpur for three days and resolve all the issues related to Mihan.
 
 Bawankule had recently organized a janta darbar for knowing the problems of Mihan PAPs. Large number of PAPs had submitted their grievances to the minister in writing. The minister directed Kakani to immediately address these grievances. He also asked the VCMD to chalk out a time bound programme for solving the problems related to Mihan.
 
 There are 800 houses in Khapri. Of these, residents of 500 houses have been rehabilitated. As 300 houses are on government land their rehabilitation is pending. Bawankule asked MADC to build cheap houses for residents of these 300 houses and rehabilitate them.
 
 The minister also said that residents of   had been given land in Chinchbhuvan. While roads had been built on this land other amenities had not been provided. A tender for a digital school should be floated. Houses for 400 families, whose houses are on government land should be built.
