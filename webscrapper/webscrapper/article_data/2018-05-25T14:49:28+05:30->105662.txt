VISAKHAPATNAM:Though the dreaded   virus (NiV) is far from the city’s shores, residents of the city are calling on the government to take precautionary measures in locations where bats are found in large numbers in order to prevent an outbreak of the disease.

 
 The Nipah virus has killed nine people in   so far, including a nurse who was treating the patients.
 
 With bats identified as a vector, authorities are considering to place warning signs in areas where the mammals roost such as caves, old buildings, palm and banyan trees. Experts said installation of caution boards would be helpful for visitors, particularly in areas like   which is home to thousands of bats.
 
 Speaking to TOI,   divisional tourism officer   said they are yet to take steps like installing caution boards at tourism places like Borra Caves.
 
 “We will definitely take steps after consulting with the right authorities as to what kind of measures we have to take at Borra Caves, which houses bats,” he said.
 
 Visakhapatnam district medical and health officer Dr Ronanki Ramesh said there is nothing to worry for those visiting Borra Caves. 
 
 The department has clearly instructed staff in all these areas, particularly those that have many bats, to take special measures.
 
 “We have a sub-health centre at Ananthagiri close to Borra Caves. Our staff will be available 24x7 to attend to emergencies and conduct awareness camps among tourists,” Ramesh added.
