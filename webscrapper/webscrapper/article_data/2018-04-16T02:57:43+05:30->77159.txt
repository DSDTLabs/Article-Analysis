MUMBAI: In one of the city’s biggest heroin seizures, police arrested a   man, Mangilal Kajodmal Meghwal (40), with 4.1kg heroin worth Rs 6 crore in  . Meghwal was to hand over the consignment to a taxi driver who was to deliver it to a woman in south Mumbai. The police said the drugs seem to have been smuggled from a neighbouring nation. 

 
 
  
 
 DCP Shivdeep Lande said they had a tip-off that Meghwal, a resident of Kota, was to come to Matunga on Saturday evening. “We arrested two persons in October 2017 with heroin worth Rs 2 crore. We picked up the thread from there,” said Lande. Meghwal has been booked under sections of the NDPS Act. He has been remanded in police custody till April 18.
 
 “We have the woman’s residence address but her house is locked. We are looking for her,” said an anti-narcotic cell official. The seized heroin has been sent to the   in Kalina. “Drug cartels operate in the ‘Golden Crescent’ of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, and ‘Golden Triangle’ of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos. We are trying to find out where this one came from. The FSL report will tell us about its purity, and then we can connect the dots,” added the officer.
 
 Lande said Meghwal is a ‘seasoned’ carrier who tried to evade police at various points. “He has claimed he is unmarried and his mother died long ago. He has made five trips to Mumbai. For each trip, he would get Rs 20,000-25,000. He would be given a contact number, food and travelling expenses. He has said that the woman never came to pick up the drugs and always sent a taxi driver,” said a source.
