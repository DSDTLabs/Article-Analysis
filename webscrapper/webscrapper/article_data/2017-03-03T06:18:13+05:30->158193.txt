KOCHI: Even as the government is preparing to present yet another budget, many road projects which were announced in earlier budgets remain on paper. 

 Pullepady-Thammanam-Arkkakadavu-Infopark Road, which is supposed to be corridor between IT hub and the city centre, a four-lane road connecting Infopark with Kochi-Madurai NH at Puthenkurisu and the four-lane connecting   with Perumbavoor via Kizhakkambalam and Pattimattom are some of the projects which figured in the earlier budgets but havewhich failed to take off.
 
 Given the fact that the extension work of metro rail to Kakkanad would soon start, Pullepady-Thammanam-Arkkakadavu-Infopark Road project assumes much significance. "If the government doesn't allot funds for it in the budget, traffic congestion may lead to the district headquarters getting cut off from the city centre. The  , which connects the city with the district headquarters is already congested. Once the metro work begins, the situation will get worse," an official with an IT project at Kakkanad said. "As the alignment of the road is through paddy fields, which remain uncultivated for years, land acquisition for the road may not be a major issue," said a source.
 
 Speaking at a review meeting of SmartCity just before the inaugural of the IT project's first phase in 2015, former chief minister   and the then works minister V K Ebrahimkunju had assured that the works on four-lane roads connecting SmartCity to other parts of the city and the district would begin immediately. 
 
 However, the UDF government did nothing for making the promise come true. When the LDF government assumed power, it also has failed to take steps to start the work.
