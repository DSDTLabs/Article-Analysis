KOTTAYAM:   premises became a warzone as protesters laid siege to the station from Monday morning. It being a poll day, the news gained political importance. Almost all   arrived in the district to join the protest. Protesters booed the IG and tried to manhandle the Kottayam SP. Traffic was disrupted and most of the channels aired the entire proceedings live though bypoll was progressing in  .

 
 It began around 10.30am when Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan visited Kevin’s house and declared a protest strike. Soon Youth Congress and KSU activists arrived to show their support. Soon BJP and CSDS launched their agitations. As the protests intensified, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala arrived. He talked to officers and left for Kevin’s house. Congress leaders sought a probe led by the ADGP.
 
 Meanwhile, YC activists did not allow IG Vijay Sakhare to enter the police station and this led to a mild clash. Talks between the IG and Radhakrishnan also did not produce a result. Amid the chaos, there was an attempt to manhandle Kottayam SP Mohammed Rafique.
 
 Tension outside the police station increased as no decision was taken by the police. However, there was a strict directive to the police to abstain from provocations. Even as the IG discussed the issue with higherups over the phone, Oommen Chandy, Joseph Vazhakkan and K Sudhakaran arrived and KC(M) chairman KM Mani too joined the UDF leaders.
 
 The protest did not slacken despite the rain. Finally, UDF leaders called off the protest after it was declared that the case will be investigated by a team lead by Vijay Sakhare. BJP, BDJS workers continued their protest. BJP workers dispersed after the arrival of party general secretary MT Ramesh. The traffic through Gandhinagar-Medical college road was disrupted till the protest was called off. Normal traffic resumed only after 4pm.
