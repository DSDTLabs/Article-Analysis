SURAT: The   (SGCCI) will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the   for the development of Rs 1,800 crore worth of mega   during the Vibrant Gujarat summit. 

 SGCCI president B S Agarwal said that the mega textile park is the dream project and it will change the face of Surat’s textile sector. The chamber will be signing an MoU with the Gujarat government for allotting 70 lakh square metres of land at Pinjrat near Olpad. 
 
 SGCCI office-bearers said that the presentation has been prepared by IL&FS and that it was well received by the senior government officials. The SGCCI has appointed around 15 directors to head the SPV for the mega textile park.
 
 The mega textile park project conceived by the SGCCI is worth over Rs 1,800 crore. The park will accommodate around 100 textile processing units, 40 water jet weaving units, around 225 garmenting units and other  , attracting a total investment of Rs 10,000 crore.
 
 As per the proposed plan, the mega textile park will house giant textile processing units, each having average capacity of manufacturing over 3 lakh metres of fabric per day. Around 50 per cent of the fabric manufactured in the processing units will be converted into home textiles and garments. The rest of the fabric will be sold outside the state. 
 
 At present, the textile sector contributes around 40 per cent of the synthetic cloth in the country 
 
 But its share in export is quite meagre, because the export market requires huge quantity of cloth of same quality which cannot be supplied by the processing units in Surat.
 
 Agarwal said, “Processing units in Surat are located in Pandesara, Kadodara, Palsana and Sachin industrial, each having one CETP plant. At present, all CETPs are working to its fullest capacity and they are not allowed to expand, because tthey do not have further capacity to dispose the effluent. Thus, these processing units could be shifted to the mega textile parks.”
