HYDERABAD: Telangana chief minister   came down heavily on   in the Legislative Assembly G   for claiming that the state government was using central funds for promoting its sheep rearing scheme. He stressed that it was a state government scheme and it was not using a single rupee from the Centre for the scheme.

 He said the National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC)’s scheme is different from the state’s plans to distribute sheep at 75% subsidy. The NCDC scheme provides loans at 10.33% interest rate, he explained.
