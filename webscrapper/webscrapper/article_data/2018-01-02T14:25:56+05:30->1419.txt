CHENNAI: The Centre is swallowing the rights of states, and the latest example for this is the National Medical Commission (MNC) Bill and changes being proposed in issues licence to motorists, said   working president M K   on Tuesday.

 "Across the country, doctors are on a warpath against the   which is proposed to be set up in place of Medical Council of India. After the fraud committed by former   chief Ketan Desai, several committees were set up. Even before getting their reports, the Centre appointed another committee under a joint secretary of the Prime Minister's Office. The measures being taken is only based on the PMO joint secretary report," said Stalin in a statement.
 
 He said the proposed NMC would hit students aspiring to do medicine. "The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) has affected students from the lower strata. Only after clearing the  , a student can enter any medical college. The new medical Bill proposes entrance for PG courses also. Thus at each and every stage of medical education, there is a hurdle which the students will have to cross," said Stalin. 
 
 The NMC was against social justice and would bring back the licence raj, he said.
 
 Stalin said the new Motor Licence Bill was another attempt to usurp the rights of states. "In the name of bringing down the accidents, the Centre is taking up all the rights of states and acts like a big brother. The Centre must give up tough conditions being proposed for a person to get a driving licence and instead lay some needed conditions alone. Stringent measures will affect the drivers and their families and the automobile industry," he said.
