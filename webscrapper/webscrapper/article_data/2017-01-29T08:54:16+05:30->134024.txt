PUNE: The State Election Commission has directed collectors and   to work out the means to allow   while filing nominations for the forthcoming  . 

 Candidates have complained that the deposit amount - Rs 5,000 for candidates contesting open seats and Rs 2,500 for those contesting reserved seats - is demanded in cash. 
 
 "I will direct all the district collectors and commissioners to streamline this system," state election commissioner J S Saharia told TOI. 
 
 However, election officials from the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) maintained that at the moment, they don't have the e-payment facility. "Right now, we told the candidates who are  , to pay the amount in cash, and enter the same in the form. If any new directions are given, we will follow them," said the official.
 
 Candidates said it was ironic that they were being asked to make the payment in cash in the wake of the government's push for a cashless economy post-demonetisation.
 
 "It is an unnecessary waste of time," said a candidate, who has yet to file his papers. He said he was planning to approach other candidates, so that they can together contact the election officials to make this a cashless system.
 
 "The system should change. We should be able to simultaneously file our nominations and the deposit amount (online)," said another candidate.
 
 It was only for this election that the SEC took the system of filing nominations online. Under this system, candidates are required to submit soft copies of all the necessary documents on the online portal. Following this, a printout needs to be taken to the designated ward officer for a signature and entry into the system. 
 
 As per election officials, the system was implemented during the recent municipal council elections. It was observed that the number of rejections was minimal.
