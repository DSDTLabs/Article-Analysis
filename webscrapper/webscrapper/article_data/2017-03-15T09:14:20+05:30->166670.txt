CHENNAI: With some schools phasing out their fleets of buses or increasing fares due to  , more private vans - a popular choice of many parents as they come cheap - are set to hit city roads. 

 This will further compromise the safety of children since vans are not bound by any safety guidelines.
 
 Even with 28,000 fitness certificates issued to school buses running in the state, private vans continue to grow in demand especially in the last few years with several private schools hiking bus fees. With vans all set to become more ubiquitous, the debate on safety looms large. As new schools crop up every year in the city, many parents rely on these private vans which are run entirely independent of the school authority’s purview. 
 
 However, Rajesh, who is in the business of ferrying children in vans, said, "We try to bring in sufficient safety features, just like in a  . We have first aid kits, proper seating and a lady attendant to ensure the children are safe, and board and de-board properly." Another van operator said most private companies use safe vehicle models and alert parents in case of a breakdown or other emergencies.
 
 Yet, the issue of accountability remains unanswered as vans neither have a checklist of safety features nor a committee to inspect efficiencies. Currently, school buses are mandated to be inspected periodically by a ‘special committee’ comprising four members who can give the ‘safety seal’ - one motor vehicle inspector, PTA member, police and local education authority. This is the gap vans fail to bridge. 
 
 A   official said, "It is not possible to regulate privately operated vans."
