Model-actress Emily   said she will only do movies where her character has more to do than just be a   of the male lead. 

 The 26-year-old star said she always applies the   test, where two or more women speak about something other than a man, when considering her roles.
 
 "I'm always looking for scripts that pass the Bechdel test and this is definitely one where, for the first time, you see my character in their own world and their story through their perspective - not just a male perspective, and that's exciting for me," Ratajkowski said.
