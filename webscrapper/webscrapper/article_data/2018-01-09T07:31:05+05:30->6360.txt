AHMEDABAD: Thieves burgled six flats at   in Vatva on Saturday night. Rajnish Rai, the occupant of one flat, has lodged a complaint with Vatva police station while other five residents got their statements recorded by police.

 According to police sources,  , cash and other valuables have been stolen from the flats. According to Rai’s complaint, while he with his family was staying at their flat in Maninagar, he got a call at about 5am from his neighbour, informing him about a theft in his flat.
 
 “Rai rushed to Shakti Gardeniya and found that the lock on the main door was broken and the house was ransacked. He reported that jewellery and cash were stolen from his house. We were also informed that five other flats were burgled in different blocks of the same apartment complex. We have recorded the statements of the other victims and are hunting for the gang,” added a senior police official.
 
 Thieves usually target shops and showroom in the winter as roads are empty due to cold at night. “However, this is new trend, where the flats burgled were all locked and their occupants were out. Normally houses and flats are burgled on summer nights, when occupants sleep on the terrace or have ACs on, which allows thieves to operate under the cover of the noise from ACs,” added a senior police official.
