BENGALURU: The batting exploits of   and   has added impetus to India's sagging campaign. After the day's play, India's batting coach   dwelled on the team's plans. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 The batting group got together and had a chat about how our approach had been. We also looked into the past, on how we negotiated spin and what were the areas we could have adapted better in the first innings. It was a good chat and we came up with solutions. I think the batsmen really applied themselves (on Monday), used their feet well and were trying to get to the pitch of the ball as much as they could, and also playing on the back foot.
 
 
 
 
 We have fought really well in the last few days. After the setback of not scoring runs in the first innings, clawing back, the team has stuck together, not letting the game run away from us. I think what lies ahead could be exhilarating stuff.
 
 
 
 
 It will be a tough surface for both teams and the cracks are going to get wider. How they adapt to all the surface and conditions is important. The game is in the balance.
 
 
 
 
 I don't think it has gone to that extent. We are new to DRS and the rules have been tweaked a bit. It is very much the umpire's call, which becomes really, really crucial. We haven't really sat down and evaluated about it. We are in the learning process regarding the decision reviews.
 
 
 
 
 What was happening is that since we got out cheaply in the first innings, bowling fast bowlers a lot was part of Virat's plan to bring the run rate down. (This is why) the pacers had an extended spell on Sunday. Left-handers were batting at both ends and we tried to bowl Ashwin from over the wicket.
