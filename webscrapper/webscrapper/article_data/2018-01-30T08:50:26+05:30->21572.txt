 Sources in the traders’ community said that the decision of Gujarat government will go a long way in curbing the problems faced by the textile traders regarding the generation of e-way bill for the intra-city and intra-state movement of the textile fabrics. However, the traders will continue to demand the extension of the national e-way bill for another six months.
