JAMSHEDPUR: At a time when fuel prices are on the rise, particularly after introduction of dynamic pricing which came into effect in May 2017, an association of the Sikh youths has come forward with a unique scheme of helping denizens avail funds to purchase fuel. 

 Under the scheme, any person willing to secure the loan will have to make a down payment of Rs 14 per litre of petrol and deposit three signed cheques of Rs 20 each.
 
 To avail the loan, one has to carry his or her aadhaar card and bank passbook to the Sakchi-based office of   (AISYF). 
 
 "On the first day, three persons availed the loan at our inaugural camp (organized in Sakchi)," state functionary of AISYF, Satnam  , said. 
 
 Explaining the thought behind the scheme, Gambhir said they did not have any business motive but wanted to extend help to the needy. 
 
 AISYF also aims to draw attention of the government to the fact that fuel prices have reached exorbitant levels and neither the Centre is intervening nor the state is ready to reduce VAT. "The Centre should scrap the policy of decontrolling fuel price administration," Gambhir said, adding that the oil companies' role in determining the fuel prices has not benefited the consumers at all.
