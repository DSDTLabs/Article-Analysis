GURUGRAM: Villages surrounding   in Sohna will soon be given lessons on how to coexist peacefully with wildlife in the wake of recurring instances of leopard-human conflict on the outskirts of Gurugram recently.

 The wildlife department is planning to carry out camps in three villages to spread awareness among the inhabitants about the dos and don’ts for reducing man-animal conflicts. 
 
 District forest officer (wildlife) Shyam Sunder said, “We have been meeting sarpanches in four to five villages to organise a conflict management programme. Villagers too have shown interest in such camps,essential to avoid any panic situation in villages.”
