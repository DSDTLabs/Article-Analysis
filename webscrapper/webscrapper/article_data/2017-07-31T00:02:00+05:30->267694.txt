Pune: Eco-friendly immersion of Ganesh idols will be a lot easier for citizens this year. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will provide ammonium bicarbonate, a solution used to dissolve the idols made of plaster of Paris (PoP) to the distributors of idols so that it is easily available for citizens. 

 The National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) has developed the solution. “ This method can help promote eco-friendly ways of immersion. It can be a good precedent. So we have decided to make it available to citizens at the time of buying the idols,” Suresh Jagtap, head of PMC’s solid waste management department, said.
 
 According to NCL, dissolving a one kg idol requires an equal quantity of the compound to be stirred well in five litres of water. The proportion is 1:1. After placing the idol in the pot or tank filled with water one needs to stir the water four or five times at intervals for the idol to dissolve in two days.
 
 Elected members have supported the move. The standing committee recently approved a proposal to procure 100 tonnes of ammonium bicarbonate from Raigad-based Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers Limited (RCF).
 
 It has been increased by 15 tonnes with an expected increase in demand. Last year, the civic body had distributed around 85 tonnes of bicarbonate in societies through ward offices. The individual households as well as housing societies had purchased it.
 
 “Steps should be taken to make the festival progressive and eco-friendly. Such new methods can help in doing so. They should be promoted,” mayor Mukta Tilak said.
 
 According to PMC’s data, around 25,000 idols were dissolved using this method last year. A group of activists have opposed the move saying that it was against tradition.
