Panaji: The state government has been dragged to court over delays in setting up of a state   transplantation organisation (SOTTO). A voluntary organization, Mango Foundation has filed a writ petition in the high court of Bombay at Goa highlighting the failure of the government to set up a SOTTO. The petition is likely to come up for hearing in the first week of June after the court re-opens post the summer break.

 The petitioner said that not having SOTTO in Goa has directly resulted in prospective patients losing out on opportunities to undergo organ transplantation. A wait list has not been created either as the SOTTO has not been set up though   ( ) and hospitaldespite being SOTTO being notified a while ago.
 
 The petitioner’s counsel,   stated in the petition that it is deeply disturbing that despite the Transplantation of Human Organ Act (THOA), in force since 1994 and the updated rules being formulated in 2014, the executive has missed its duty in implementing the same.
 
 The petition pointed out that GMC being the only registered transplant centre in Goa, has been corresponding with state health secretary for setting up SOTTO. It sent a proposal for the same to the health secretary for approval on January 10, a month after it was identified as SOTTO. “The secretary replied to the proposal on March 13 asking trivial questions. The GMC sent its reply on April 16, while the health secretary has been sitting on the proposal. The proposal is yet to be finalized and instead sent to Regional Organ and   (ROTTO) to allow it to be notified as SOTTO,” the petition stated.
 
 The petition also mentioned about the recent case where organs retrieved at a private hospital were allocated to patients outside Goa in the absence of a wait list, since there was no state organization in Goa.
