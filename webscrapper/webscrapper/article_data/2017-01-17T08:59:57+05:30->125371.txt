BENGALURU: The Lokayukta institution seems to be jinxed as   on Monday returned the recommendation of the government to appoint former   Justice P Vishwanath Shetty to the post.

 According to sources, the governor is said to have advised the government to go into the merits and demerits of the candidate it recommends for the institution. It is learnt the governor took cognizance of allegations made by social activist   against Justice Shetty and has sought a response from the government.
 
 Hiremath had alleged that Justice Shetty had bought a site in Bengaluru's Judicial Layout by submitting a false affidavit and had lodged a comp laint with the governor demanding an inquiry into Justice Shetty's assets. Sources in the CM's Office said: “Since a few clarifications have been sought, we will refer the matter to the advocate general, seek the official response and will communicate it to the governor.“ Justice Shetty emerged as the unanimous choice at a high-level meeting of the collegium on January 9 to pick the new Lokayukta.
 
 The anti-corruption watchdog has remained headless ever since former   left suddenly in December 2015, with ruling and opposition parties sparring over the choice of candidate.
 
 In earlier meetings of the high-level committee, the government failed to reach a consensus with members of the collegium. Chief minister Siddaramaiah is the chairman of the collegium.
 
 Unlike in the case of justice SR Nayak whose appointment as Lokayukta was opposed by the opposition, Justice Shetty's name was accepted by opposition BJP leaders without queries.
