It's in May, 2017, that the historic initiative from Malayalam cinema, Women in Cinema Collective aka   came into being. 

 As they reach the first year mark, WCC is organising a 'cinema and conversations' platform in Kochi today. The programme, titled 'Punarvayana,' will also have the screening of the renowned Ketan Mehta movie 'Mirch Masala.' The post-cinema conversations are to be moderated by K K Shahina, renowned media personality. 
 
 The forum came into being after the infamous case of actress assault shook the world of movies and raised questions about the safety for women in the industry. Bina Paul, Manju Warrier, Parvathy,  ,  , Remya Nambeesan and Indu Namboothiri were among the few who met the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan last year, seeking support for the initiative.
