CHENNAI:   Governor (incharge) C Vidyasagar Rao must immediately appoint the state election commissioner, said DMK working president M K Stalin on Wednesday. "The post of the   has remained vacant since March 22 after (the then commissioner) P Seetharaman retired. No step has been taken by the state government to fill the vacancy," he said in a statement.

 Stalin said the replies given by the state election commission to the Madras high court on holding the civic body polls showed that both the SEC and the state government were not ready to go by rules. 
 
 "The SEC in a careless manner told the high court that it would not be possible to hold the local body elections before May 14. The high court adjourned the case after warning the SEC that it would lead to contempt of court. This shows the lackadaisical approach of the headless SEC and the state government," said Stalin.
 
 "The state government must immediately send the concerned file to the   who has the power to appoint a new state election commissioner. If the state government does not send the file, the Governor, using his powers under Article 167(B), call for the file from the government and appoint a new SEC," he said.
