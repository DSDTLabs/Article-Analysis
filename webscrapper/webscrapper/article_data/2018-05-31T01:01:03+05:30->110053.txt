Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of former commissioner of the Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) P Dhanapal in the temple idol-casting case.

 Justice T Krishnavalli heard the case filed by Dhanapal and dismissed it.
 
 The idol wing police registered a case for alleged misappropriation of gold collected by way of donation for making the processional idol of the famous Lord Sri Dhandayuthapaniswamy temple, Palani in 2004. He is one among the accused in the case. According to the FIR, an estimated 200kg of gold was collected for the idol but only a small quantity was used and the remaining had been misappropriated.
 
 The petitioner contended that the case had been filed 14 years after the idol was made and pleaded that he had no connection to the case. 
 
 Police have so far arrested four people, including two officials of the HR&CE and a sculptor, in connection with the case. TNN
