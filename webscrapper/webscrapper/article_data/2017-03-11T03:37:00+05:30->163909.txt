Panaji: Highlighting the huge increase in the number of paramilitary personnel inducted by the home ministry, director of the national institute of public finance and policy (NIPFP), Rathin Roy, said that a 300% hike in numbers has virtually ruled out the possibility of reducing the country’s fiscal budget to zero.  “There are around one million paramilitary personnel right now. Majority of these are not guarding industrial sites or borders, but are embroiled in counter insurgency operations within the country. You throw bullets at the people, you pay the fiscal price for it. We cannot touch allocations assigned for the armed forces as they say that the money is vital for the country’s defence,” Roy said.  He added that the country is currently spending 25% of the total revenue on just paying interests and 20% on subsidies.  Talking about the measures taken by the government to improve the situation, Roy pointed out that considering the critical nature of the economy the government has prioritized in increasing allocations for affordable housing and roads.  “The central government is almost broke and its public investment capability is limited now. Therefore, the finance ministry prioritized in allocating money for affordable housing and construction of roads. Sectors like agriculture, health and education have been trimmed,” he said.  He added that the country has to increase the size of the economy to accommodate all the sectors adequately.  Roy praised the performance of state governments, who have successfully replaced the central government as becoming the primary public investor.  “Majority of states, including Bihar and West Bengal, are performing positively in the role of public investments through joint ventures with neighbouring states,” he said, adding that the introduction of GST would not affect the state economies as long as their purchasing capacity is good.
