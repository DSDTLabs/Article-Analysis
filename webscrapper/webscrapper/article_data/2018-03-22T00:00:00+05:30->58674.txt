With the Commonwealth Games around the corner, the national men’s hockey team is training hard at the   (SAI), Bengaluru. After a gruelling training session in the morning, the Men in Blue travelled all the way across town to meet with Team BT recently, even though all they wanted to do was go back to their rooms and rest. The fun bunch of talented guys — captain  , vice-captain  ,  ,  ,   and Sumit — showed us that they are not just sporty on the field, but off it as well. Not once did they hesitate when it came to posing in the middle of the busy MG Road for a photo shoot, or climbing into (and onto) an autorickshaw. Although weary after their morning practice session, they were full of energy when it came to talking about the game and each other.

 
 
 “We’re practicing hard for the Commonwealth Games next month. Practice sessions are always intense before any tournament and training in Bengaluru, with the weather changing every few months, is a bonus, since we get used to playing in all kinds of situations,” says captain Manpreet. The men will take on Pakistan in their maiden match at the Games. Considering such matches grab a lot of eyeballs, do they feel any added pressure? “To us, it is just another match. Of course, we are aware that the emotions among fans is high when we play Pakistan, but we don’t think about that when we are on the field,” adds Manpreet.
 
 After battling a knee injury, goalkeeper Sreejesh had a great outing in the four-nation tournament in   recently. After coming back to the squad, the senior player says that he views his game as ‘pre-injury’ and ‘post-injury’. “I am actually enjoying my game now more than I ever have before. The injury was a lot to take physically and psychologically, but I am back and raring to go. Earlier, I used to work hard, but now, I work smart,” he says. 
 
 
 
 The Indian men’s hockey team received the Team of the Year award at the Times of India Sports Awards. What makes them such a powerful team? “We work together as a team and spend a lot of time with each other. In fact, we spend more time together as a team than we do with our families, so we have become a family. More than on the field, we have a good bond off the field as well, which translates to good performance overall,” says Rupinder. But is communication ever an issue, considering they are all from different parts of the country, speaking different languages? “Even though we speak different languages — such as Punjabi, Haryanvi, Kannada and Malayalam — we have decided to converse in Hindi, since it is a language that we all understand. It helps when we are playing matches, since the other teams can’t understand what we are saying,” says Manpreet. But that wouldn’t work with Pakistan, would it? “For them, English is enough,” says Sreejesh, evoking laughter all around.
 
 
 
 The team has been training at SAI for the longest time. While their week is packed with training sessions, they get some time off on the weekends. That is when you are most likely to spot them at malls, restaurants and cafés across the city. With the spotlight shining bright on these strapping young sportsmen, how are they handling all the attention, especially from the opposite sex? While Manpreet and Rupinder — the two who the team says are most popular with the ladies — are polite and patiently pose for pictures, Sreejesh says that since people know that he is married and is a father-of-two, they approach him with, ‘Hi, brother. How are you?’ Sunil, who got married recently, is quick to add that he doesn’t get any female attention (we doubt that, though). Unfortunately, he hasn’t been able to give his new bride much attention either. “I’m spending all my time at the camp. Ours is an arranged marriage, so she knows about my schedule and is okay with it,” says Sunil. Sreejesh adds that it is hard to strike a balance between family and sports life, but having an understanding wife makes all the difference. “My wife raises our two kids and manages everything without me. Whenever I go home, I try to spend quality time with them. This time around, luckily, my family is here with me, so I don’t feel homesick.”
 
 
  
 
 
 But how do the others deal with homesickness, considering that they spend nearly all their time away from home, training in Bengaluru or being out on tournaments? “They may be away from home, but they are all very close to their girlfriends,” jokes Sreejesh. On a serious note, Rupinder adds, “This is our family. When we go back home for a few days, we get bored. That’s when we miss this family (the team). These guys are my family and friends.”
 
 
 
 Like all young men, the hockey team likes going out and having a good time, but the game is and always will be their first priority. Sreejesh sums it up well when he says, “Hockey is always our first priority. We definitely need to have fun outside as well, because that’s a distraction from hockey. It’s important to get away from the game momentarily, so that when you are back on the field, you are refreshed. Fans approach us, and that’s a good thing. We take all the attention that we get in a positive way. We are the brand ambassadors of hockey, so we need to promote the game in every way we can — through fans, by playing well, and by coming for interviews like this. And with good looking guys like these (points to his teammates) as the brand ambassadors of the game means that we will only widen our fan base.”

 Most sportspersons are known to be superstitious and have some ritual that they follow before any big match. And the hockey team isn’t any different. While Sunil wears the same shoes for every match (he told us that he does wash them), Sreejesh and Rupinder don’t change their grips till the stick breaks. Sumit, on the other hand, changes the grip after every match. All of them call their parents before every match; Manpreet plays football video games before each match, and Sunil prays to 13 Ganesha idols. Sreejesh, on the other hand, does nothing apart from drink a cup of coffee before each match, which he says fuels him on the field.
