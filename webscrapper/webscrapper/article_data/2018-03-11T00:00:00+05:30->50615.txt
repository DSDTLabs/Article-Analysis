 are in vogue as research proves that setting the right colour tone on your table can make your food taste better.

 Did you know that   is the new home haute couture? As kitchens become the centre point of our homes, we are looking for more creative options in tableware. The   is colourful mismatched ceramics – we are talking green glasses, pink plates, blue bowls and more. The choice of colour, tone and texture are key words when selecting new tableware. Ceramic designer Rekha Goyal says, “Food looks nicer on coloured plates. In summer, people like to enjoy their food from different summery plates – like a dull yellow for snacks, mint green for dessert or a bright blue cup to enjoy coffee.”
 
 
 Interestingly, researchers from the University of Oxford discovered that the colour of utensils you eat in have a big influence on what you taste. Need more reasons to pick colourful crockery? A UK-based hygiene products company SCA did an in-house ‘brain tracking’ experiment on diners to find out if they reacted to colour. They found that green had a positive effect on their wellbeing while yellow induced feelings of fun. 
 It may even help you stick to your diet! A Cornell University study published in the Journal of Consumer Research found that a high colour contrast between food and plate makes you eat less. In the study, participants who were served pasta Alfredo on a white plate ate 22 per cent more than those who were given red plates. But go for it for the fact that mismatched tableware looks trendy. “There’s a lot of experimentation with new colours in ceramics,” Goyal adds. Pick your playful plates now.
