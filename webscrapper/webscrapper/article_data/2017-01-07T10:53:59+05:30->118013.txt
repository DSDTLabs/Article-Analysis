CHARMINAR:   and dangling electrical wires along   roads pose a threat to lives here. 

 Residents said   authorities have not secured power lines despite their requests. The open transformers and hanging wires pose a danger to pedestrians. Residents said Telangana Transco installed the transformers at a low level across Old City. 
 
 "Live cables are just few feet or more above the ground at Puranapul road," said a Puranapul shopkeeper  . Two transformers were installed on the ground level without enclosures at   recently, he said. "This problem has been persisting across the Old City for the past several years, but the authorities do not seemto pay any heed to the matter or to our complaints.

 Though high tension wires were removed from some areas, the problem still exists in several localities.
