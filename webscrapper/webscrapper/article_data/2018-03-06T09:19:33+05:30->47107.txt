SALIGAO: The Aldona village panchayat has taken a resolution to recover house   arrears and also to initiate action against households failing to pay monthly rent to the panchayat. This decision was taken at the gram sabha of the panchayat held on Sunday.

 The gram sabha, which was scheduled to start on time was delayed by half-an-hour due to lack of quorum. Raising objections to the extraordinary gram sabha, a villager questioned the sarpanch as to why notices about the meeting were not published as per the Panchayati Raj Act. 
 
 The sarpanch said that the date for the gram sabha was announced in the church well in advance and even e-messages were sent to all members of the village development committee.
 
 The meeting also proposed a budget of Rs 1.76 crore for 2018-19 after incorporating changes suggested by the villagers. A villager, Marie D'Souza, demanded that house tax assessment be done and that dues be recovered from the defaulters. The sarpanch said the panchayat has data and time will be given till March 31 to defaulters to pay house tax dues, or else, action will be initiated.
