GREATER NOIDA: The   of   welcomed chief minister Adityanath Yogi’s announcement of debt waiver and of a proposal to buy back stacked-up wheat produce.

 The twin announcements have given hope to the community which has been reeling under financial distress over the last three years because of the cash crunch and crop damage. Yogi’s announcement on wheat purchase made in Gorakhpur, came soon after his announcement on farmers’ debt waiver. Both moves are being seen in a positive light by the farming community which was badly hit by the Union government’s demonetisation drive in November which crippled crop sales.
 
 “We welcome the goodwill being extended by the CM towards the farmer community,” Dushyant Nagar, convenor, Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, said.
