LUCKNOW: The imperfectly applied red nail paint on nine-year-old  's tiny nails brings back only horror for the little girl. 

 
 On Thursday morning, she survived a deathly attack on her by a pack of ferocious   in   village of Sitapur district. 
 
 In between staring blankly at the ceiling of the ward at King George's Medical University's trauma centre, Sangeeta murmurs something amid tears coupled with fear. 
 
  "Nail polish subah subah lagaya tha usi din; tab kaatis nahi tha kutta (I had applied nail paint on the morning of the  , just before it happened)," she said. Having undergone a stomach surgery on Thursday night following the attack, Sangeeta added after a pause, "I had just gone to relieve myself in the fields after applying nail paint. I didn't even see the dogs. They just started attacking me from somewhere suddenly." 
 
 There were four of them, she said, her eyes full of fear.
 
 Sitting beside her, Sangeeta's uncle   said, "It was around 7am that she went out. The field is our own and barely 800 metres from our home. We were fortunate that my uncle and I were present in the vicinity. We rushed as soon as we heard her screams. In barely a few minutes, dogs much larger than normal village dogs were on top of her. We started throwing whatever we could find around us at the dogs and they ran away. She would have been dead had any more time passed."
