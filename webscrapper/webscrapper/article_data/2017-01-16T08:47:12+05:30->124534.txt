With each passing year, the marathon seems to be inspiring Mumbaikars to get fitter. Fewer marathoners required hospitalization or advanced medical aid on Sunday, despite the   levels not being conducive for a long run. Doctors called it a mark of rising awareness as well as preparedness among runners.

 “We treated 2,500 participants this year as compared to 4,000 last year. It means participants are better prepared and well-trained,” said Dr Vijay D'Silva, medical director of   (AHI). Doctors of AHI managed 11 aid stations and two base camps along the course of the run. The 2,500 participants sought help for dehydration, muscle cramps, sprain and exhaustion. Eleven people had to be taken to nearby hospitals but mostly for observation. Nisar Tamboli (47), a DCP from Aurangabad who collapsed, was rushed to Jaslok Hospital in  , where doctors found him to be disoriented. “He regained full orientation within a short time after we started him on intravenous fluids,” said cardiologist Dr Shoaib Padaria. Tamboli has been kept under observation in ICU. 
 
 “With the memory of gynaecologist Dr Rakesh Sinha losing his life due to a heart attack while training for the marathon still fresh, we were alert in managing all cases,” he said. Six of the ten patients were admitted to Bombay Hospital while Hinduja in Mahim and Lilavati in Bandra treated two each. 
 
 In 2014, a banker had suffered a stroke during the run and died after being in coma for nine months. A 52-year-old businessman from Powai had to be revived with cardiac shocks metres before the finish line in 2015. “The   has come a long way from there,” Dr Vijay D'Silva said adding that a pleasant morning temperature could have been the reason for lesser incidence of dehydration. Runners, however, said they took extra 30-45 minutes to complete the race because of humidity.
