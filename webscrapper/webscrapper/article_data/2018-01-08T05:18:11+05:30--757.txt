NEW DELHI: Demand for athletic gear in India has always surged during December due to millions of people making a New Year resolution to head to the gym. But this time, sportswear firms saw up to 100% growth in sales in December, thanks to early end-ofseason sale across the country.

 “We did twice of what we usually do in other months,” said Rajat Khurana, MD of Japanese footwear maker  . “While New Year resolutions have always helped us get good results in December, we could rake in better numbers in 2017 due to end-of-season sale and marathons.”
 
 End-of-season sale for the last quarter of the calendar year traditionally used to take place in January but in 2017, it was brought forward to December.
 
  
  
 
 Similarly,   MD   said December was a high-traction month for the German sportswear firm. “Sports and fitness are clearly getting more prioritised and are topping New Year resolutions,” he said. “We have seen a substantial uplift in consumer demand during December this year. Across channels, our sales is 30% more than the average monthly sales for the year.”
 
 Categories such as running, training and fitness usually do well for sportswear companies during the end of the year, while at other times, companies bank on athleisure (active wear that people can wear outside a gym) for a bulk of their volumes.
 
 Several industry experts that TOI spoke to said e-commerce companies are disrupting traditional shopping patterns in the country due which end-of-season sales, even for sportswear makers, are being rescheduled.
