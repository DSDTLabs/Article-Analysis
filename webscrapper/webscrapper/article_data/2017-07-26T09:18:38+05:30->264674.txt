GUWAHATI: In a fresh salvo against Hindi speaking people, the anti-talk faction of ULFA asked   government to evict the   living in   and   districts of Upper Assam and rehabilitate those indigenous people who have lost their land house in the current wave of flood.
 
  Hindi speaking people refers to people settled in Assam from Bihar, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Assam forest minister, Parmila Rani Brahma have stated that she had made attempts to rehabilitate some of the landless indigenous people of the state at Tarani reserve forest area under Doomdooma forest range, which was opposed by some local people.
  
  Anti-talk Ulfaâ€™s publicity secretary Arunodoi Asom stated, "It is a matter of concern that such a conspiracy is being hatched not only to destroy the reserve forests of Assam but also to make the indigenous people fight against each other. Thousands of bighas of lands in Tinsukia and Dibrugarh district of Assam alone have been illegally encroached upon by non-Assamese and Hindi speaking people. The government must think of evicting those lands and rehabilitate the genuine landless indigenous people who had lost their lands due to flood and erosion."
