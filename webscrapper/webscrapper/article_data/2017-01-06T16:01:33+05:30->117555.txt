 In a statement to news agency ANI, Banerjee said, "In current situation a national government should be formed with another BJP person at helm. He (Modi) has to go."
 
 Lashing out at the prime minister, Banerjee said, "To save country, let a national government be formed. Advaniji, Rajnathji or Jaitleyji can head it. Current situation is unacceptable." 
 
 A national government is a coalition government, especially one subordinating party differences to the national interest in a time of crisis, as in Britain under Ramsay MacDonald in 1931.
