THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Senior Congress MP   on Saturday denied showering praises on Prime Minister   after the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) had issued him a show-cause notice.

 Thomas, representing   in the Lok Sabha, blamed the media for the “erroneous reporting of the English speech at the Kerala Management Association (KMA) meeting” here on Friday.
 
 Besides the show-cause notice served by KPCC president M M Hassan, leader of the opposition in the state assembly   and other Congress leaders, too, sought clarification from Thomas.
 
 According to reports, Thomas, while inaugurating the national management meet organized by Kerala Management Association (KMA), had lauded the prime minister’s performance and management skills.
 
 Thomas reportedly said Modi has the knack to convince people while making harsh decisions.
 
 Compared to other   leaders, Thomas felt comfortable communicating with Modi, reports quoted the MP as saying.
 
 “Though there are political and ideological differences with Modi, his management abilities cannot be ignored,” he reportedly said.
 
 Thomas posted the clarification on his Facebook page on Saturday.
 
 “I said that Modi had taken some anti-people decisions and implemented them with his management skills. I asked management students to probe how he has been able to make use of the management skills to mislead public on important matters. This way, he has been able to influence media and even judiciary,” his post read.
