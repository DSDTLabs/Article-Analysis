JAIPUR: The   of   in big cities like Jaipur and Patna is not even enough to   of their employees, forget them having funds of their own to   or improve services.

 This was revealed in a study conducted in 21 big municipal corporations by advocacy group Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy (JCCD).
 
 Among other cities in the list are Kanpur, Ranchi, Chandigarh and Ludhiana.These cities not only depend highly on financial support from their respective states but also use funds earmarked for development work and services to pay salaries of their employees. According to JCCD's rth annual survey on fourth annual survey on `India's City Systems', the salary component of em ployees of   is 320 per cent more than its total earnings. For Jaipur, the figure is 199 per cent.
 
 The findings come at a time when the central government is pushing for building `smart cities' in which the financial health of municipal bodies has a key role to play.
 
 The report exposes how none of the 21 cities surveyed have policies to check on violations of planning norms, something evident from the rise in slums, unauthorized colonies and other illegal constructions.
 
 All the 21 cities scored a perfect `zero' on this account as against the score 9.1 and 10 for London and New York, respectively.
