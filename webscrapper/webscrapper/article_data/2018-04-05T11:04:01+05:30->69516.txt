LUCKNOW: To decongest Charbagh railway station,   (NR) has proposed to remodel   station into a satellite station at an estimated cost of Rs 26 crore.

 The revamped station will have extra track lines, waiting lounges, lifts and escalators. As of now, there are only three platforms and four tracks at Alamnagar station. They are used to halt and pass trains.
 
 While only a few trains halt at the station, more than 35 pass through the section on a daily basis. According to divisional railway manager (DRM) NR Lucknow division Satish Kumar, “Two extra tracks will be constructed along with an island platform. These tracks, which will also be interlinked with Utretia Junction, will be used for arrival of Mail and Express trains.”
 
 
 Kumar added that during rush hour at Charbagh railway station, the tracks will be used to refer freight trains also. This will help in checking train delays, he added. The station will also have a modern waiting lounge,  ,  , one lift and two escalators. LED lights will illuminate the station. Besides, a new signalling system will be installed to check delays. Construction has already begun.
