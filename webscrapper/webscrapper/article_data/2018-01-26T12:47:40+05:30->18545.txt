PANAJI:   has approached   challenging the order of the high court of Bombay at Goa that dismissed its disqualification petition filed against health minister  . The development is likely to create a fresh headache for   who quit the Congress in a huff and joined the BJP.

 Goa pradesh Congress committee president Shantaram Naik said that he was unaware of the move to file a petition in the Supreme Court. Justices G S Patel and Nutan Sardessai had dismissed the disqualification petition filed by Congress before the high court against Rane on the grounds that a disqualification petition was already filed before the assembly speaker. Speaking to TOI, Goa desk-in-charge A Chella Kumar said, “On behalf of AICC and GPCC, I have filed the appeal on January 20. The party cannot compromise on this issue because after all we are fighting for a cause and not against a person.”
 
 Opposition leader Chandrakant Kavlekar also claimed to be in the dark over the development, giving rise to suspicions that the Congress was a divided house on the issue. “The move was discussed,” Chella Kumar said.
