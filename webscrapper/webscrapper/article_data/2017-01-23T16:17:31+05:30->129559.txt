NEW DELHI: Underlining the severe shortage of judges in the lower  , a   report claimed there were 16 judges to address the needs of every million, whereas there were 42 police officers of the rank of inspector or above available for the same population.

 In terms of total strength, Group A civil servants across the country numbered 91,501, police officers 51,523, but the number of judges in the lower judiciary stood at just 20,174, according to data from 2015.
 
 The report prepared by the apex court’s  , said judges’ strength needed to be at least doubled in the next 10 years to handle the increasing number of cases being filed in lower courts. If this “crying” need was not addressed, it warned the lower judiciary would be in danger of crumbling under the twin pressures of shortages of judicial officers and lack of proper infrastructure.
 
 
  
 
 “The role of robust judiciary in a nation’s development is pivotal. With development and a corresponding growth in litigation, more judges would certainly be required to handle the same so that justice is done in its truest possible sense,” the report said and recommended that judges’ strength be increased to 40,000-80,000 by 2040 to handle the rising number of cases awaiting adjudication. 
 
 Making a compelling case of how citizens’ basic right of access to justice was being affected, the report compared the strength of police officers and bureaucrats and concluded that the lower judiciary was the most understaffed organ of the state. It said proper infrastructure in terms of court rooms and residential accommodations for judges was not available, making it difficult to deliver timely justice to litigants.
 
  “Based on the study and keeping in mind the future growth in institution of cases, it is found that the present judge strength is insufficient to deal with a huge figure of pendency of cases, which is a cause of concern,” the report said.
