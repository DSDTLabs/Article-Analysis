BAREILLY: Expressing his disappointment over the complaints received against   —   hired by the   to provide   —   (enforcement) S P Singh has instructed the agency to stop opening of new common service centres (CSCs) in the district with immediate effect.
 
  CSCs are being opened in both rural and urban areas to provide quick services to citizens in redressal of their grievances and for providing certificates for their caste, income and status which is needed for filing applications for jobs or admissions in schools and colleges.
  
  The ADM also slapped a fine of Rs 2 lakh on the agency for missing the deadline set for opening of CSCs in every village.
  
  The ADM said in each of 1,843 villages of the district, a CSC was to be opened, but the firm could open only 60 centres, that too, mostly in the urban areas.
  
  Meanwhile, the ADM has also received complaints against the agency from the applicants who could not get a chance to own CSCs despite completing all formalities.
  
  “We have received complaints that the agency has charged extra fee up to Rs 5,000 for allotting CSCs to applicants. The actual fee for applying for a centre is Rs 15,400 but, according to complainants, they paid Rs 21,000 for the same. An inquiry has been marked into the allotment of CSCs in the district and a report will be sent to the government to take action against the agency,” said the ADM.
  
  The ADM said he had asked the agency to furnish a written explanation.
  
  Kamal Sharma, an official at national information centre at collectorate, told TOI, “Vayamtech has won the tender to set up CSCs in Bareilly and Devipatan divisions. These centres were supposed to be started by December 2016, but the progress in Bareilly district is very poor, which disappointed the ADM and he not only slapped a fine of Rs 2 lakh on the agency, but also stopped them from working in the district.”
