KOCHI: Following its decision to eliminate unmanned level crossings earlier this year, the railways is now planning to not have new manned level crossings and gauge conversions.

 An order dated May 18, 2018 from the executive director of   and structures, railway board, addressed to general managers of all zonal railways states said: “Instructions were issued that no new unmanned level crossings should be introduced on the system. In continuation to these instructions, it has been further decided that no new manned level crossings will be permitted in new line and gauge conversion projects.”
 
 However, Southern Railway officials said that no instruction to this effect has been given to them. “The target to remove all unmanned level crossings by September is in place. However, no directions pertaining to manned level crossings have been issued so far,” the railway divisional manager,   said.
 
 Doing away with manned and unmanned level crossings would mean the construction of under and over bridges at all level crossings, which would be a costly process.
 
 “Directions have been given to collect and compile the number of manned and unmanned level crossings in the division and study about the feasibility of possible interlockings in the lines. The board needs the data to understand how many of such level crossings can be eliminated, and how many will need overbridges,” south zone principal chief engineer said.
