PATNA: Preparations for the closing ceremony of the 350th   of Guru Gobind Singh have begun in the state capital. Around 15,000 devotees from across the country and abroad are expected to visit Takht Sri Harmandir Sahib to attend the celebrations from December 23 to 25 this year.

 At a recent meeting of the DM, civic body commissioner, Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee members and tourism and urban development officials, it was decided that devotees would get similar facilities that were provided to them in Patna City last year, albeit on a smaller scale.
 
 “The district administration is gearing up to welcome visitors from all over the world. In a bid to provide better facilities to them, we are likely to set up a tourism facilitation centre at the Kangan Ghat near the Patna Sahib Gurdwara like we did earlier in January this year,” a senior official said, adding the facility would be ready by November-end. 
 
 According to sources, a tent city, consisting of the Diwan Hall (makeshift gurdwara) and Langar Hall and spread over an area of 45 acres of land, will come up at the Kangan Ghat for the devotees. Accommodation facilities will be made in colleges and schools near the ghat in case the tent city lacks space. Besides, ‘Gatka’ (Sikh martial arts performance), horse race and other cultural activities will also be organized in the state capital.
 
 For the main closing ceremony on December 25, a Diwan Sahib will be developed to accommodate 5,000 devotees at the Patna Sahib Gurdwara.
 
 While Patna Municipal Corporation workers will clean the area where arrangements for Langar (community meals) will be made, the Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited will provide transportation services from the city airport and the railway stations.
 
 Unlike the inaugural ceremony which was funded by the Centre and the state government, the closing function will be completely funded by the state government.
