NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party ( ) has asked   for Women to take action against   state chief   after a video surfaced, showing Tiwari allegedly misbehaving with a teacher during a public event. 

 Deputy CM   tweeted the video clip of the incident and said : “Bhakton, see how your state chief is insulting a woman teacher. Where is RSS and where is culture? Why are all teachers association affiliated with BJP and defenders of nationalism now quiet at the insult of this teacher?"
 
 Later he posted another video of Tiwari, tweeting: “After insulting a teacher, Tiwari is asking whether she has committed suicide.” 
 
 
 
 The party also accused BJP of being anti-women. Party’s Delhi convener Dilip Pandey said: “We strongly condemn Tiwari’s action and request DCW to take strict action against him. The people of Delhi will teach a suitable lesson to BJP and its anti-women members.” He added, “The teacher had, very respectfully, requested the MP to sing. He usually sings a few lines on his own but the way he reacted to the request shows that he is high on power,” Pandey said. 
 
 The teacher met Tiwari on Saturday and reportedly said that she was shocked that the matter, which was sorted after she apologised, was being blown out of proportion. Responding to the charges levelled by AAP, Tiwari said that the teacher concerned had violated protocol but he had asked the authorities not to take action against her since she had apologised. He said: “The teacher asked me to sing. All I told her was that she should respect the constitutional post I hold. I’m an MP”. 
 
 He hit back at Sisodia and said that it is the AAP government that is threatening teachers and not fulfilling its promises.
