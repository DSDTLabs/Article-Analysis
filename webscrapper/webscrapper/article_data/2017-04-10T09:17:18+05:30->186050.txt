HYDERABAD: One swallow does not a summer make, but   has proved that his performance in the first match of the IPL-X was no flash in the pan. His encore at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on a hot Sunday afternoon handed the   their second consecutive defeat of the tournament.

 For the second time in three days, the Lions lost it in the powerplays, reduced as they were to 402 and ultimately to 1357. The   needed no second invitation, and courtesy 21 runs conceded by Lions' skipper Suresh Raina in the third over, cruised to 591 in the first six and finished the match at 1401.
 
 The nine-wicket victory was an emphatic statement by the Sunrisers after their 35run win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the season opener and skipper David Warner (76 no; 45b, 4x6, 6x4) - who completed 1000 runs at this venue - made sure he didn't miss out like he did in the first dig with the two common denominators being Man of the Match Rashid and Moises Henriques (52 no; 39b, 4x6).
 
 The 18-year-old leggie was the toast of the town after he scythed through the Lions' top order when summoned into the attack in the fourth over with Jason Roy on the ascendancy. The Englishman was the initial aggressor till his partners  , Aaron Finch and Raina succumbed to the wiles of the Afghan.
 
 If his first spell of 3-0-12-3 was magical, his second (1-07-0) was no less as he sent down 11 dot balls in all ­ Rashid also scored a direct hit from mid-wicket to run out Dhawal Kulkarni -and but for a 56-run partnership between   (30; 32b, 4x2) and Dwayne Smith (37; 27b, 4x4, 6x1), the Lions would have had much less to show for their lacklustre batting performance.
 
 It was in complete contrast to the Sunrisers batting as they made light of Shikhar Dhawan's dismissal in the fourth over to finish guns blazing. While the last five overs saw the Lions add a paltry 33 runs to their total, the Sunrisers never took their foot off the pedal during the unbroken 108­run second wicket stand between Warner and Henriques.
 
 It was Warner's 23rd half century for SRH, ninth at this venue, and with scores of 74*, 24 and 93* before this encounter, he gave no respite to the Lions.
