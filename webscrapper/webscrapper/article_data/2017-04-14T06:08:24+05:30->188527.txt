PUNE: The defence counsel in the   kidnapping, gang-rape and murder case concluded his final arguments on Thursday, insisting that the accused be given the   as there was no strong evidence against them. 

 Pujari, a software engineer with an IT firm in Kharadi, was kidnapped on the evening of October 7, 2009 and her body was found two days later in the Zarewadi forests in Khed taluka. The Yerawada police arrested Yogesh Raut, Mahesh Thakur, Vishwas Kadam and   in connection with the crime. Chaudhari later turned an approver and is among the key witnesses of the prosecution. 
 
 In his concluding remarks, defence counsel Biju A Aloor argued before additional sessions judge L L Yenkar that the circumstantial evidence brought on record by the prosecution was not strong enough to merit conviction of the accused. 
 
 He submitted that the accused have denied all the allegations and taken a specific defence that the victim was raped and murder by the accused-turned-approver and his two aides. 
 
 Special public prosecutor   will reply to the   on April 15. 
 
 The conclusion of final arguments takes the case further close to the judgment.
