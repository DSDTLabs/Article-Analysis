Panaji: Defence minister   urged the state administration to resolve the   of Mayem issue by issuing 70-80% of the provisional sanads to the verified residents. Paarikar also suggested that the state could utilize several strategies to speed up the process.

 The state issued provisional sanad certificates under the Goa Abolition of Proprietor ships, titles and grants of lands to 62 individuals on Monday. “This is around 18% of the total claims. This year, we should try settling 70-80% of the cases, maybe by hiring retired officers to resolve the issue. We can also ask the high court to take up the case earlier and resolve it so that these people don’t have to worry about the judgment,” Parrikar said.
 
  The government has received 1,141 applications for sanads with 1,123 sent for scrutiny. The   collectorate has processed 202 applications of which 62 sanads were issued by Parrikar.
