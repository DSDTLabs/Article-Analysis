NASHIK: The general body of the Nashik Municipal Corporation on Friday set up three special committees and appointed members to these committees. The special committees will function independently of the 'prabhag samitis'. 

 The committees - law committee, city development committee and medical assistance and health committee - were approved by the general body members after heated arguments of nearly an hour. Since the Congress-NCP failed to provide members from their parties, mayor Ranjana Bhansi said that as per the party strength, MNS members would be appointed in the committees. 
 
 Setting up of the committees were approved unanimously during the last general body meeting. On Friday, only the names of the members for the committees were to be declared. But many corporators objected to the purpose of having the committees, when there were prabhag samitis in each of the six divisions, while some questioned about the functioning of these committees. 
 
 Group leader of NCP, Gajanan Shelar questioned the need for such committees and was said that the proposal should have come from the civic chief rather than from BJP corporator Sambhaji Moruskar.
 
 Moruskar said, "The proposal was approved in the last general body meeting with the approval of the opposition leader. There is no government order that says there should be no other committee if there were prabhag samitis."
 
  corporator Hemlata Patil wanted to know the budgetary provision for the committees. 
 
 Corporator Dinkar Adhav said, "These committees functioned from 1992 to 1996 and their rights were also defined."
 
 BJP corporator Shashikant Jadhav said there was provision in the law for the mayor or the municipal commissioner to form such committees. Group leader of  , Vilas Shinde said his party approved of the committees. The members were welcomed by the mayor.
