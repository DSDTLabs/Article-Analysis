Recently, when   had a session at the   (NSD), he told the audience that he was accepted by the academy in his first attempt.   director   added that more than the people who get through, it is those who are rejected by NSD that understand what it means to be accepted in their first attempt. So, for the next interaction at NSD, the speaker was someone who was rejected multiple times –  .

  
 
 Bajpayee, who is also a guest lecturer for third-year students at NSD, told the audience, "I did theatre for three years before applying to NSD for the first time, but I was rejected. I reapplied several times par inhone mujhe liya nahin. Inke nahin lene se itna toh hua ki meri intensity (towards the craft) badhti gayi," and after a pause, he added, "Thank you NSD for not selecting me."
 
  Among the audience were students of other colleges as well, and some complained about how difficult it is to get into NSD. One student said, "NSD ko toh haua bana diya hai. Sirf 26 seats hain." To which Manoj replied, "Shikayat mat karo, koshish karo." Replying to a question about the unfair economic returns in theatre, Bajpayee said, "Agar aap kisi guarantee ki khoj kar rahe hain, toh guarantee kahin nahin hai. Gaurantee toh aapko NSD ke director bhi nahin de sakte. The only thing that can be guaranteed is your happiness. I can guarantee that you will be happy, because it will be your choice."
 
  When a student asked him how his parents reacted when he decided to pursue theatre, Bajpayee said, "I still have a letter that my father wrote to me, saying that ‘Mujhe pata tha tum abhineta hi banoge."

 In reply to a question about how to get over a character that an actor plays, he said, "I did a film called Shool. I could not get over that film for a long time. I used to start shouting suddenly, and felt like I was suffering from a nervous breakdown. I had to go to a psychologist finally."
