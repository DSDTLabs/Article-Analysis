BHOPAL: A single-judge bench of MP high court reserved its verdict on the release of Sanjay Leela Bhansalis film 'Padmaavat' following arguments from both sides.

  The petition has been filed by producing company of the film, Ycom18, contending that the company is incurring heavy losses due to non-release of the film in the state. 
 
 
  
 
 Counsel for the company said that the Supreme Court had lifted the ban on films release in four states, including MP, but cinema halls and multiplexes are not screening the film because they are not being provided adequate security. In addition to chief secretary and principal secretary of home,  , the body of film distributors in MP, has also been made a party in the petition. 
 
 Appearing on behalf of the state government, advocate general Purushendra Kaurav said that the petition should have been moved before the Supreme Court and not high court because order to screen the film was that of apex court. After hearing both the sides, Justice Vandana Kasrekar reserved her judgement on the petition.
