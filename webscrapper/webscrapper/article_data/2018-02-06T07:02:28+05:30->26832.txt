LUCKNOW: With just two weeks to go for   and a large segment of micro, small and medium enterprises feeling that the focus was on big industries only, the government has decided to hold day-long talks with industrialists in Kanpur. Indian Industries Association, the umbrella organization of MSMEs in UP, had recently carried out a study of possible investments from   to assess the extent to which small industries could contribute to the state. 

 The government was quick to deny that MSMEs were not being given due importance. "Kanpur is an important industrial town and government is committed to promoting local industries. They are our real brand ambassadors," said industrial development minister Satish Mahana. 
 
 IIA had earlier expressed concern about its limited role in the summit. IIA president   said, "We met IIDC   recently and raised the issue. He assured us that we are in fact the brand ambassadors of the state. We are now happy that we are being given attention," said Vaish.
