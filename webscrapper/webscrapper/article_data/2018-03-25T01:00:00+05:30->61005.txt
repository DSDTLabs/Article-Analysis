BHAGALPUR: The CBI on Saturday arrested Dr Vinayak Chandra Diwakar of Bhagalpur in connection with the   in Madhya Pradesh.

 A CBI team from Bhopal interrogated Dr Diwakar, a 2010-2015 batch MBBS student of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (JLNMC), at his residence at Barari in Bhagalpur for nearly five hours before producing him in a district court and seeking his remand. He was later taken to Madhya Pradesh by the CBI team led by inspector Shiv Kumar Jha.
 
 According to CBI sources, Dr Diwakar is allegedly involved in the scam that has rocked Vyapam (Vyavsayik Pariksha Mandal) of the Madhya Pradesh government, which conducts examinations for admissions to professional colleges in Madhya Pradesh.
 
 The sources said Dr Diwakar, a native of Pahunasi village under the Kursakanta police station area in Araria district, was living in a tenanted accommodation at Barari after completing his MBBS and internship from JLNMCH.
 
 JLNMC principal Dr Hemant Kumar Sinha told TOI Diwakar completed his MBBS in 2015 and internship in 2016. “I do not know anything more than this,” he said.
 
 The Vyapam scam, involving selection and admission of medical students and Madhya Pradesh government employees by rigging its competitive examinations, came to light in 2013, when the Indore police arrested some students who had come to impersonate pre-medical test candidates. Later, a PIL was filed in the high court in Madhya Pradesh following reports that more than 300 ineligible candidates made it to the merit list of medical entrance test.
 
 The CBI sources said several bright medical students of different colleges in Bihar and other states were under the CBI scanner for allegedly impersonating medical aspirants in the Vyapam examinations.
