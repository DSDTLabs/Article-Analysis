VADODARA: Gone are the days when one needed to wait weeks for the perfect photograph. Now, smartphones have made clicking selfies and videos at press of a button. 

 But few have wondered about the detrimental effect selfies have on people’s mental and physical health. A panel discussion on ‘Expression: Me and My Selfie’ followed by an exhibition on the same topic on Saturday at M   (MSU) discussed such aspects at length. The event was organized by Faculty of Family and Community Sciences, Women’s Studies Research Centre and   and Communication. The panellists included eminent speakers such as associate professor from MICA, Ahmedabad Dr  , director of Indian Psychology Institute Matthijs Cornelissen and social media expert Dr Khushboo Pandya.
 
 Pandya said, “Selfie is now a craze among people of all ages and everyday you find innumerable selfies posted on social media platforms. However, there is a need to understand the phenomenon and also know where to draw a line. Like everything, it also has both positive and negative effects and one has be to aware about that. To take your own self portrait is a good thing but similarly you should know the boundaries. We saw many accidents in clicking those selfies and also in long term it affects the mental and physical health of the selfie-taker.”
 
   , dean of faculty of journalism and communication, said, “As a faculty of journalism, we try to provide holistic experience to our students. We wanted them to understand what lies behind the selfie manifestation and a deeper understanding of self.” Post, the panel discussion, students from the faculty happily clicked selfies and put them on display, which were later judged and winners were handed prizes.
