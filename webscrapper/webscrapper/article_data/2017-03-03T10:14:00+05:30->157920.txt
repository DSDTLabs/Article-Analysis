PUNE: Two men posing as   of a   robbed a 62-year-old   of gold jewellery worth Rs 1.8 lakh in Khadki on Wednesday after making her smell some gel-like substance.

 The incident occurred around 11.30am when the woman was alone at her home. “The woman lives on the ground floor of a building on Mula Road in Khadki. At the time of the incident, her husband, daughter and daughter-in-law had gone to work. Even her son, who had taken leave from work, had gone out to pick his son from school,” S B Bhosale, sub-inspector of the Khadki police station, said, adding that the woman’s brother-in-law also stays in the same locality.
 
 Around 11.15am, the suspects approached the woman’s brother-in-law, who did not entertain them. “The duo then made their way to the woman’s house and asked her to check out the products newly launched by the company,” Bhosale said, adding that the woman initially showed no interest and asked them to leave.
 
 The duo, however, convinced the woman to check some of the products. “One of the suspects took out a tube and applied some gel-like substance on the woman’s left hand and requested her to smell it,” the officer said.
 
 As soon as the woman smelled the gel, she started feeling dizzy. “The woman then remembers of going inside the house before blacking out,” he said.
 
 After regaining her senses, the woman noticed that her gold chain was missing. “She also found that two of her bangles and two rings were gone too,” Bhosale said. She immediately approached her brother-in-law to enquire about the duo. Meanwhile, one person standing near the woman’s house told her that he saw two men rushing out of her house. Police have registered the offence under section 420 (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the IPC.
