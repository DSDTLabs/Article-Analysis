BENGALURU: Following an order from the  , and several representations from parents and students, the ComedK (Consortium of Medical, Engineering and Dental Colleges of  ) had to reschedule the process of its second extended round of counselling on Sunday late evening. The extended counselling was closed for students who had been allotted seats in the second round.

 Citing innumerable representations and appeals from parents and their wards, the committee directed the ComedK to throw open the   of counselling to students who had already accepted allotments in the second round. The students should be allowed to upgrade their colleges and the time should be extended till August 5, the committee said.
 
 A ComedK notification said in view of the committeeâ€™s order, those who had participated in second round of counselling are eligible to participate in the extended round. The allotments will be made based on the options already made by them. Candidates who were not allotted any seats in the second round of counselling will not have any limit while entering options. If these candidates get an allotment, these candidates have to pay the entire tuition fee at the colleges since there is a shortage of time.
 
 Students who are allotted seats in the second extended round will have to report at colleges till August 7 or before for document verification and complete the admission formalities. The detailed process will be published on website on July 31.
 
 Citing the orders of the Supreme Court, the ComedK had earlier refused to organize any more rounds of counselling after the second round, leaving hundreds of students and their parents worried across the state. The   ruling said the counselling for engineering should be finished by July 31.
