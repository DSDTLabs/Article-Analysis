What do you call an enemy’s enemy? Friend, of course! After their relationships with director   soured,   and  , who couldn’t see eye to eye till a few months back, have become friends. On her birthday this February, Mimi was in Bali with her parents, but once the actress returned, her friends threw a cosy bash for her. I was surprised to hear that chilling out at the party was Subhashree, who dropped by to wish Mimi well. The party was a lesson in girl bonding.
