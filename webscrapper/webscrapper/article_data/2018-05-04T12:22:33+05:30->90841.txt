AGRA: A letter from the former deputy registrar of Dr   (now retired) Harish Chandra, threatening to reveal a certain CD that could malign the exam controller, KN Singh, was recently found by the university registrar, Ravindra Pal Singh.

 Singh, who has been taking up issues related to corruption since his appointment earlier this year, subsequently issued a notice to Chandra on Wednesday, asking him to hand over the CD in question within the next three days or provide a proper explanation. The notice also said that if Chandra failed to comply, his pension would be stopped. Dealings of the examination controller have also come under the scrutiny of the registrar. 
 
 “You know I have your CD. If I send it to the state government, you will never get promoted to the post of registrar,” the letter, which was written during the tenure of the former deputy registrar, said. According to sources, the deputy registrar retired on August 31, 2017. He had objected to certain actions of the exam controller.
 
 The university registrar said, “A letter from the former deputy registrar, mentioning a CD which would have stopped the promotion of the examination controller was recently found. I have asked him to hand me over the CD.”
