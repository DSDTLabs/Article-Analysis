VIJAYAWADA: While there has been a 16 per cent overall   in the state in the   registered under Special & Local Laws (SLL) in 2017 compared to 2016,   has witnessed a substantial   in the number of these cases filed under the special acts. 

 In terms of the cases registered under Andhra Pradesh Gaming Act and   and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS), the city saw 11 per cent and 184 per cent increase. However, the rise in the number of the cases under SLL resulted from the special enforcement drives, but it does not indicate scientifically that the crime rate under this category has gone up.
 
 Not just in Vijayawada, other district police units like Vizianagaram, Nellore, West Godavari, East Godavari, Visakhapatnam city and Rajahmundry Urban saw a sharp increase in the cases against gambling and cricket betting. This rise is due to the ban imposed last year against cock fighting and enhanced enforcement against cricket betting. Vijayawada also took up complaints of copyright infringement and duplication last year. 
 
 The major crackdown by the police can be significant in the circulation of duplicate painkillers, and both the distributors and manufacturers were arrested.
 
 Other cases registered under the SLL include the Excise & Prohibition Act and the Immoral Trafficking Act. Under these crime heads, the number of cases registered is much less, compared to other rural police units like Kurnool, Vizianagaram, Ananthapur and Vizag Rural. 
 
 Vijayawada has been a major transit hub for ganja smuggling from the agency areas towards Tamil Nadu and Kerala. 
 
 Durga Prasad, a senior member of Bezwada Bar Association said that more awareness is needed on the   among the police department to ensure better efficiency while charge-sheeting such cases.
