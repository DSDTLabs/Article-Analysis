HYDERABAD: Congress leader and former MP V Hanumantha Rao, who is seeking action against Hyderabad Central University   P Appa Rao in the suicide case of research scholar  , surprised everyone on Monday by urging the high court to make the President of India a party in the case. 

 The former MP's counsel C Damodar Reddy told a bench of Justice V Ramasubramanian and Justice J Uma Devi that section 8 of the Central University Act makes it imperative for the President to order an inquiry against the University authorities. 
 
 The President is the visitor of the university and in this capacity, he has powers to cause an inquiry into the affairs of the university, the counsel said. 
 
 The bench was reluctant to grant any such order at this stage and sought the production of the copy of the said Act and postponed the case. The bench, however, allowed the   to implead itself in the case as a party following an application by the association.
