Keeping in pace with the city’s celebration mood, the   district police have included a new feature called ‘Track Alagar’ in their mobile   ‘Madurai Kavalan’ in view of the Chithirai festival when   will be visiting the city. 

 The feature will be useful to public during the festival time since they can track the route of Lord Kallalagar and the current road blocks for his journey. With this information on their mobile, people can plan their travel accordingly and need not worry about traffic congestion.
 
 The feature will cover the entire schedule of Kallalagar’s visit from his departure from Alagarkoil to his return to the temple. Apart from using the feature to learn about traffic arrangements, people can also know where he is travelling at present and visit the deity to offer their prayers. 
 
  could be downloaded free of cost from   Play Store for all android mobile phones and the users who had already downloaded it can update the application in Play Store to get this new feature.
 
 Launched in December 2017, Madurai Kavalan mobile app provides facilities like e-complaint portal, police stations and officers’ details. Recently another feature, Locked Home Monitoring System was launched in the application and so far the police have received more than 2,000 responses.
