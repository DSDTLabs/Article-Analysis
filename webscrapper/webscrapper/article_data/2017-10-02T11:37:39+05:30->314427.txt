KOCHI: The   ( ), a public sector company, is set to computerize its operations. This will be the first step in rolling out several new features and the company will issue a comprehensive tender in this regard later this year.

 H  , managing director of Bevco, said the company has been trying to digitize their operations for many years but they have not been able to execute it successfully due to several hurdles.
 
 He said they received the approval of the state government a few months ago and now the company has been engaged in the process of preparing the tender based on its requirements.
 
 Venkatesh added that digitization was a key step towards incorporating several new and innovative features to the services of Bevco, which they could not implement at the moment due to the lack of digital infrastructure.
 
 "Post digitisation, customers can check the availabi lityprice of a particular product via online. Also, we could get information like day-to-day sales, which brand is selling well, which brand is not moving, etc," said Venkatesh, who pointed out that introduction of card payment via point of sale systems at certain outlets of Bevco has been a success, with a significant number of customers opting for digital payment.
