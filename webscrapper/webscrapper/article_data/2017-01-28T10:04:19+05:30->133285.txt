BATHINDA: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) member   on Thursday had to face the wrath of residents of Chandbaja village in Kotkapura assembly segment in Faridkot allegedly for using harsh words against village sports club members. Mand was confined in a house in the village for nearly four hours and set free only after he apologized.

 The SGPC member had gone to Chandbaja along with Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Mantar Singh Brar, who is contesting from Kotkapura constituency. They were campaigning in the village when Mand had an altercation with village sports club president   and villagers who raised slogans against the Akali Dal. The villagers also accused SAD of not being serious in solving the acts of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib.
 
 Chandbaja youth sports club president Lakhwinder said, “A couple of months back,   had announced a grant of Rs 2 lakh to the sports club for organizing a cricket tournament. On Thursday, we demanded money when Brar and SGPC member Mand came to our village for campaigning. The MLA tried to convince that money had been sent, but Mand used derogatory words. Angry over his act, villagers confined Mand in the house of an Akali supporter and released him only after four hours as he tendered an apology.”
 
 Mand termed the incident as a political conspiracy at the instance of opposition parties. He said, “I had not used any derogatory words against anyone.”
 
 MLA Brar said, “The youth sports club had an issue with me over the grant of Rs 2 lakh. I had assured them to release the money and returned. Later, they had an altercation with SGPC member Mand. The issue was later settled after SGPC member felt sorry for using some harsh words.”
 
 Faridkot senior superintendent of police (SSP)   said, “There was some misunderstanding between villagers and the SGPC member. The issue was settled later on. As no formal complaint was lodged from any side, no case was registered in the matter.”
