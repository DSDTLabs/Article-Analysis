New Delhi: A BJP delegation led by the party’s Delhi unit chief Manoj   met election commissioners A K Joti and Om Prakash Rawat on Tuesday and submitted a complaint against alleged irregularities in AAP’s   records.

 The BJP functionaries alleged that the donation figures put up on AAP’s website and those submitted to the EC and income tax department in 2014-15 and 2013-14 were different.
 
 BJP claimed that prima facie it was a clear case of violation of the Representation of People Act, 1951, and Election Symbol (Allotment & Reservation) Order, 1968.
 
 “We have requested the EC to order a thorough inquiry into the matter,” Tiwari said. BJP also demanded de-recognition of  .
 
 Referring to corruption complaints lodged by suspended AAP   with CBI, Tiwari sought CM Arvind Kejriwal’s resignation. “The allegations (against the CM) have been made by a former minister. Kejriwal should resign from his post,” Tiwari said.
 
 Meanwhile, BJP youth wing members staged a demonstration near Kejriwal’s residence, demanding resignations of the CM and his cabinet colleague Satyendar Jain. Mishra had levelled corruption charges against the two. 
 
 The protesters marched from Indraprastha College towards CM’s residence in Civil Lines. Heavy security arrangements were in place to stop them from reaching Kejriwal’s residence. Police had to use force and water cannon when some protesters tried to scale the barricades. 
 
 “Priya Dabas and Anmol Rana are among those who suffered serious injuries,” said BJP functionary   who led the protesters. “People of Delhi are feeling cheated because they thought Kejriwal is a symbol of honesty but he has been accused of accepting bribe of Rs 2 crore from his colleague and helping his relatives in getting land worth Rs 50 crore.” He alleged that the Delhi government was involved in corruption and was protecting the corrupt.
