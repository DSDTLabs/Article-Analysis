GHAZIABAD: The   of six students of   in Indirapuram (Shakti Khand) staged a protest outside the office of the Basic Shiksha Adhikari ( ) on Thursday, demanding action against the institution for barring their children from attending   for non-payment of fees.

 The parents alleged that the school was taking from them “annual charges” apart from tuition fees. They claimed that according to an order passed by UP government in 2016, private school cannot charge annual fees from students. They added they would pay the annual charges if the school management was willing to give them in writing in this regard.
 
 Sapna Garg, whose two children study in the school, said: “The school management is not willing to give us anything in writing. How can we pay any arbitrary charges to the school? My two boys, who study in Classes V and VI, have not been promoted. The school has not even issued their report cards.” Arushi Sharma, another parent, said: “The BSA had two days ago written to the DPS principal asking her to allow all six children to attend the school. Despite that, the school is adamant on annual charges. On Wednesday, some students had gone to the school with the letter issued by the BSA, but the principal did not allow them to sit in the upper classes.”
 
 DPS principal Meeta Rai said: “We’ve not issued the report cards as their parents have not paid annual charges. We did not say anything to children through the year, but we cannot allow them in the new session if they do not pay the charges. There is no such order which stays annual charges.”
