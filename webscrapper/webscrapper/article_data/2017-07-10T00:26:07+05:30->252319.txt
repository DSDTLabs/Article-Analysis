She may be a well-known name in the television circuit today, but   confesses that in her heart, she will always remain indebted to theatre and that’s also where her passion lies. “Which is why I never let go of an opportunity to star in a play or do some sort of theatre whenever I get time off from shoots,” says Supreetha, who plays a prominent role in the daily soap Kulavadhu.
 This month will see Supreetha playing notable roles in three acclaimed plays — Mysooru Mallige,   and  . “Theatre is where my life began; it’s been 14 years now. All these three plays are extremely dear to me and in two of them, I will be sharing the stage with my husband Pramod Shetty,” she tells us and laughs as she adds that she will be playing mother to her husband. “In fact, on Saturday, we performed   to a full house and the excitement of donnig make-up, waiting for our cues to go on stage, the greenroom banter and hearing the audience clap after a particularly good performance offers a high like no other,” she says.
  She feels that if her acting skills are spoken about today, she owes it all to theatre. “There’s no better training ground for an actor than theatre. There’s no luxury of retakes. The emotions are raw and the performances unedited and passionate. Every aspiring actor should go through the wonders of this medium. Even today, after so many years in television, I learn something new each time I perform in a play,” she sums up.
