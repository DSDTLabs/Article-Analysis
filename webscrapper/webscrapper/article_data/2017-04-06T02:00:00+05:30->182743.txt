PATNA: Thousands of devotees on Wednesday participated in Shobha Yatras while chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram’ with ‘Ram Ji Ki Nikli Savari’ playing in the background. 

 Altogether 28 yatras were taken out from different parts of the city. They all assembled at the Dak Bungalow crossing which was decked up to welcome them and other devotees. 
 
 Once the chariots reached the Dak Bungalow crossing, flower petals were showered on them. Huge portraits of Lord Rama and Hanuman along with idols of different incarnation of Lord Vishnu were placed around Dak Bungalow roundabout.
 
 From Dak Bungalow, all the Shobha Yatras moved towards the famous Mahavir Mandir near Patna Junction. Huge chariots displaying pictures related to the Ramayana story gave a spectacular look to the yatras. Santosh Kumar, who was participating with his friend Amit Kumar in one of the yatras from Lodipur Sai Temple, said, “We eagerly wait for this day. It is a part of devotion as well as fun. Even women folk participate in the yatra in large numbers and we ensure no one faces any problem.”
 
 Another attraction on the occasion was the ‘shankhnaad’ by Bipin Mishra, who had come all the way from Madhubani. 
 
 BJP MLA Nitin Navin, who is one of the members of Ram Navami   Abhinandan Samiti, said the Shobha Yatras started eight years back in Patna with just eight groups. “This year, we have 28 yatras from different parts of the state capital and we aim to make Shobha Yatra of Patna one of the best in the country,” he said.
 
 Navin said Banke Bihari from Punjab and local Satender Dube were called to sing bhajan on the occasion. ‘Prasad’ was also distributed among the devotees near the Dak Bangalow roundabout and other parts of the city.
