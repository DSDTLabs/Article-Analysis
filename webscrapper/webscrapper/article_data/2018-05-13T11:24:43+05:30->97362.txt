KOCHI: The container truck drivers say it is unfair to blame them for continuing to park vehicles along the Container Road. They want authorities to either provide free   or bring the down the parking fee rates in existing facilities.

 
 "I have two trips a week and for four or five days the truck has to be parked somewhere. Personally, I don't have the money for the pay and park. It would cost me between Rs 750 and 1,000 per week. The truck owner doesn't give any allowance for it either. I park the truck on the roadside, go home and return only on the day I have a trip." said  , a truck driver from  .
 
 The pay and park facility isn’t completely secure either. “The   or a   being stolen is the same, whether I park besides the road or in the parking yard,” added Uthaman.
 
 Restroom facilities are also not yet operational. This has forced drivers to rent rooms in the nearby areas. "Our employers give a parking allowance of Rs 150 per day for 20-feet trucks and Rs 200 per day for 40 feet trucks. But these yards do not have toilets. We must rent a room nearby to avail that facility. It still costs us about Rs 2,000 a month per person." said Sarath S, a driver using the facility provided by Arpitha parking yard near   road.
 
 “The activity on the container road gives some security during night for trucks parked here. It’s very difficult to steal without anyone noticing. In the yard, night security is minimal. The parking fee is spent from my own pocket. Since there is no water or toilet facility in the pay and park yard, I have to rent a room. Accidents on Container Road are due to rash driving by people,” said Shibu S, a container truck driver.
