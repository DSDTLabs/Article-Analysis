DEHRADUN: Tiger numbers have swelled in reserves of Uttarakhand with both Corbett Tiger Reserve and   registering an increase in the population of the animals in the latest census, results of which were announced by chief minister   on Wednesday. According to the tiger estimation exercise, Corbett now harbours a minimum of 208 tigers, a rise from 163 in 2015, while Rajaji is home to 34 big cats, up from 16 in 2015. Forest department officials have attributed the increase in tiger numbers to enhanced security measures undertaken in the recent past. 

 The census, which estimated the minimum number of tigers, was based on camera trap method and was conducted as per National Tiger Conservation Authority protocols.

 Corbett director   said that a more concentrated approach was adopted this year and tiger population was monitored every 2 sq km rather than the usual 4 sq km following a grid pattern. "We obtained 3,892 photographs from camera traps out of which 2,539 photographs were used for analysis. The data showed 99 tigers in Ramnagar division and 109 tigers in Kalagarh division," Mehra said. 
 
 According to Rajaji director  , camera traps were installed every 1.5 sq km of the reserve that spans an area of 1,075 sq km. Around 562 camera traps yielded 620 pictures from which 34 tigers were identified. Wildlife Institute of India and WWF aided Rajaji authorities in the exercise.
