Mangaluru: The principal district and sessions   on Monday sentenced a Ghanaian national to two year rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 15,000 on him for overstaying his visa period and also dealing in narcotics drugs. 

 Chikozhi Francis Christopher was arretted by city crime branch police while he was attempting to peddle cocaine near Lobo Road on January 16, 2017.
 
 CCB team led by PSI Shyam Sunder had recovered 11.5grams of cocaine with a street value of Rs 5.5 lakh from his possession. Interrogation of the accused revealed that Francis had overstayed illegally in the country and that his visa had expired. A case had been registered against him under sections 121B and 175 of the IPC, NDPS Act, section 14 of the Foreigners Act, and section 12 (1) (b) (c) of the Passports Act in Mangaluru East (Kadri) police station.
 
 K S Bilagi, principal district and session judge found Francis guilty of charges filed against him under Foreigners Act and Passports Act while finding no evidence to sentence him under the NDPS Act. Francis will have to undergo six months of rigorous imprisonment and pay a fine of Rs 5,000 under the Passports Act and two years RI and fine of Rs 10,000 for offense under the Foreigners Act and additional 30 days imprisonment in default of paying fine.
 
 Since the accused has already been in judicial custody since his arrest, this period will be set off from his above sentence. The judge also directed the Dakshina Kannada district administration to extradite Francis back to Ghana at his own cost once he serves his sentence. Maruthi G Naik, police inspector, Mangaluru East police station had filed the chargesheet and Pushparaj Adyanthaya appeared on behalf of the state.
