 MC superintendent Vivek Verma said, “After depositing the property tax, you will get a receipt on which ‘QR’ is printed. The property owner as well as the MC can scan the code and check property number, the amount deposited and other details. It will also help check duplicity as every receipt will have a unique code. Residents can download ‘QR code scanner’ from the application store. It will enable them scan the code of their properties.”
