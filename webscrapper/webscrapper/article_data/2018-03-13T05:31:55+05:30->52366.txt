NEW DELHI:   got more than one-third of the total road stretches that were declared national highways in the past four financial years, according to data provided by the road transport ministry to the Rajya Sabha. Maximum stretches of state highways --- 8,000 km-- were notified as NHs during 2016-17. Data shows till January this year about 2,330 km of more roads in Maharashtra were notified as NHs. According to the ministry, a total 30,268 km was declared national highway since 2014-15 and Maharashtra’s 11,455 km roads were included in this list. Highways minister   is from Maharashtra.

 
  
 
 Tamil Nadu and   are the two other states where more than a 1,000 km each of state roads have been notified as NHs. Sources said the declaration of state roads as NHs is done based on certain criteria such as road connecting important places, tourist destinations, industrial areas and backward regions. “If there is greater coordination between the state and the Centre, the chances of getting NH tag for more roads increases,” said an official, who did not wish to be named. He recalled former highways minister T R   could not get more NHs since his rival party was in power in Tamil Nadu. However, during his regime more NH stretches were widened.
 
 Once a state road is declared as NH, the Centre becomes responsible for its maintenance and it also paves the way for the Union government to take up expansion and strengthening work.
