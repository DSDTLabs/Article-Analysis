RANCHI: After a few days of  , temperatures in Ranchi and across the state are expected to rise in the next two days. 

  The Ranchi observatory of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday said that day and night temperatures will remain normal in the next 48 hours but will rise further over the week till January 22. 
 
  While Ranchi recorded a temperature of 5.8째C on Friday and Saturday, night temperatures rose marginally above normal on Monday (10.6째C). Jamshedpur and Daltonganj recorded a temperature of 9.4째C and 8째C respectively, a little under normal. 
 
  Binay Mondal, chief weather scientist at Ranchi IMD, attributed the rise in mercury to the weakening of western disturbances in Northwestern India. "The western disturbances have weakened and have moved towards the Northeast," Mondal said, adding that the western disturbances had caused the cold northwesterly winds to flow into  ,   and West Bengal, further causing the mercury to plummet. 
 
  Mondal also said that a fresh western disturbance was developing over Jammu and Kashmir and its adjoining parts in Pakistan and could possibly move eastwards into Northwestern India. "In that case, Jharkhand will witness a cold spell accompanied by rain but not before January 22," he said. 
 
  However, due to the cold weather conditions, the city is witnessing a rise in the number of cold and fever cases. "Most of them are cases of common cold, cough and fever. Commuters, school children must take adequate precautions in the early hours of morning and evening," Dr JK Mitra, head of medicine at Rims, said.
