 “I loved watching cricket since the age of three. I watched matches on tv and also saw many videos,” Ansh said. His father Pradeep got him in the   and saw him play cricket. He recognized Ansh’s talent. “When he turned 10, I brought Ansh to Ahmedabad and met former India coach, Anshuman Gaekwad. He saw Ansh and asked us to wait till he turned 12. So I again met Gaekwad in 2012 who said that Ansh has potential,” Pradeep told TOI.
