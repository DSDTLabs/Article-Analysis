NEW DELHI: Healthcare services at various city hospitals were partially disrupted on Tuesday when   went on a strike in protest against the controversial National   Commission  .

 Emergency and critical care departments, however, functioned normally throughout the day. In many hospitals, including AIIMS and Bhagwan Mahavir hospital, doctors wore black badges to work.
 
 The situation eased later in the day when the 12-hour nationwide stir called by Indian Medical Association was called off after the Centre agreed to refer the proposed legislation to a parliamentary standing committee. 
 
 The National Medical Commission Bill, which was tabled in   on Friday, seeks to replace the Medical Council of India and also proposes allowing practitioners of alternative medicines, such as homoeopathy and ayurveda, to practice allopathy after completing a “bridge course”.
 
 “We called off our strike as the Bill has been referred to a Parliamentary Standing Committee, which has members from diverse fields and there should now be a fruitful discussion,” said IMA’s KK Aggarwal, who was spearheading the stir.
 
 Terming the Bill as “anti-people and anti-patient”, IMA said that the bill purported to eradicate corruption is instead “designed to open floodgates of corruption.”
 
 Concerns have also been raised about the lack of representation of medical professionals in the regulatory body. Many doctors say they fear bureaucrats dominating the show at NMC.
 
 However, experts are also questioning the silence of the medical fraternity on the commercialisation and corruption in the running of medical colleges and hospitals under the current system.
