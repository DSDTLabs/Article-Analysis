BENGALURU: Many customers who visited banks a day ahead of the polls had to return home empty-handed. Even ATM users were left disappointed as many machines ran out of cash.

 
 Servers were down at most bank branches on Friday, except a few in the Bengaluru's central business district (CBD). Also, many were understaffed because employees had been deployed on election duty.
 
 M Mohan Reddy, convener of the State-Level Bankers Committee (SLBC), told TOI that most employees of nationalised banks had been roped in for poll work. While this had affected services, things would return to normal Monday onwards, he assured.
 
 At the Chandra Layout branch of  , officials said they weren't able to carry out transactions as the server was slow. "A few minutes after we started work, it crashed," an official said. Nagendra S, a customer in  , said, "I visited SBI to transfer money but officials said they couldn't help me as the server was down."
 
 In Koramangala, many ATMs ran dry. "I went to the   ATM, only to find it had no cash. Though netbanking and online transactions are of great help, we do need hard cash for our daily needs and medical emergencies. We can't entirely depend on e-wallets," said, Noopur Dalal, an architect from   who was hugely inconvenienced.
