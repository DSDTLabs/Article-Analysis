For the financially stressed Rajasthan,   has brought some amount of relief. The state will receive Rs 2,078 crore more from the net proceeds of Union taxes and duties for 2016-17. It also witnessed an increase of 10.2% in its total share from the Centre for the financial year 2017-18.

 In its revised estimates, Centre has increased the share of Rajasthan to Rs 33,555 crore from the divisible pool. In the budget estimates, the amount provisioned was Rs 31,477 crore.The divisible pool is that portion of gross tax revenue which is distributed between the Centre and the states.
 
 From the pool, state has so far (till February) received Rs 24,731 crore and is supposed the get another instalment of Rs 6,676 crore in March. However, with an additional amount of Rs 2,078 crore, the last instalment will be of Rs 8,754 crore.
 
 Similarly, as per the budget estimates for 2017-18, Rajasthan will get Rs 37,228 crore from the Centre. This is an exponential increase of more than 10% when compared with the amount state will be receiving in the current financial year.
 
 The extra amount will provide cushion to state government to plan out schemes in the budget. Moreover, income generation from its own resources has seen significantly low for the current year. “We have an additional burden of nearly Rs 5,000 crore of UDAY. Along with implementation of seventh Pay Commission, if announced, will cost Rs 10,000 crore. But on the revenue side, we are facing some serious challenges, particularly oil royalty lingering around at Rs 1,750 crore till December,“ said an official.
