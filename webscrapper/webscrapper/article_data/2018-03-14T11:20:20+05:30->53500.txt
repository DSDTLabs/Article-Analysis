KOCHI: Doctors at   have developed a surgical procedure that makes it easier to reconstruct the voice box that is surgically removed due to cancer. 

 With this, instead of a complex two-staged surgical procedure 'tracheal auto transplantation' for reconstructing the voice box, there is now a less complex single-staged procedure. Tracheal auto transplantation is the process of taking tissue from an area of one's own body and transplanting it for use in another part of the body.
 
 This is especially helpful to patients whose voice box must be completely removed due to advanced cancer with one half of larynx or hypopharynx not responding to medical or radiation treatment. Reconstructing the voice box is needed to preserve swallowing, breathing and speech.
 
 In the two-staged surgical procedure, tissue taken from the forearm is wrapped around the windpipe by a surgery in the first stage and two weeks later the cancer affected half of voice box removed. "Here there is inability to reconstruct larger defects, besides causing physical morbidity to the patient and the high financial burden," said Dr  , consultant head and neck surgical oncologist,  , who has led the team that developed the new technique.
 
 With the new procedure, called Tracheal Advancement with   flap for partial Laryngopharyngectomy defect reconstruction, cancer-affected half of the voice box is removed and reconstructed by separating windpipe from larynx and advancing it up to the level of voice box, but the continuity of windpipe is left undisturbed thereby avoiding the need for taking tissue from forearm or microvascular surgery. 
 
 Also tissue from the inner part of the cheek with its supplying blood vessels is taken for treating even large defects.
