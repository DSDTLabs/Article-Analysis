JAIPUR: A 22-year-old youth,   (name changed), went into   when his beloved broke up with him. He decided to commit suicide but he dropped the idea when he thought of meeting a psychiatrist as a last chance.

 “He had already written his suicide note. Some days ago, while he was passing by, he saw my board and decided to talk about it with me,” Dr RK Solanki, head of the department (psychiatry),   said.
 
 Dr Solanki said that if Mukesh had not talked about it, he would have taken his life. This year, the   (WHO) set the theme of World Health Day 2017— Depression, Let's Talk.
 
 “Let’s talk means if you are sad or you have gone into depression, just talk about it. Otherwise, depression is a leading cause for suicide,” Dr Solanki said, adding that the 22-year-old, who was about to commit suicide, is leading a happy life now.
 
 He said that people often become sad due to certain reasons. Their sadness may end in a few minutes or hours or a few days but if they continue to remain sad for over two weeks, they can go into depression. A person in depression fails to concentrate on his work. He does not eat food on time and goes into a shell. At that point of time, he requires counselling and treatment. He often thinks of committing suicide, which is key symptom of depression.
 
 Now, more psychiatrics are recommending those who went into depression, apart from giving anti-depressant medicines, to go out and interact with friends and family. They also advise them to change their lifestyle, like wake up early and go for a morning walk, eating healthy food and also interacting with their loved ones. This helps in overcoming depression.
 
 Every year, at least 3% to 5% more cases of depression are reported in the state as awareness has also increased.
 
 Besides, the government is also taking serious steps in upgrading healthcare services in the state. Centre for excellence in mental health is coming up in   and Jaipur.
