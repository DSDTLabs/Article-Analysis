VADODARA: The office of Vadodara district   (DEO) continued to witness rush of parents who are demanding changes in schools allotted to their wards in the city under the Right to Education ( ) Act 2009. 

 It is since Monday that the DEO office is witnessing such rush of parents. While on Monday scores of them had alleged that their wards were being denied admissions by schools despite directives from state government; since Tuesday, the office is witnessing representation from various group of parents who are objecting to the schools allotted to their wards under RTE. The admission process for 25% reservation in private schools under RTE has become online from this academic year. DEO M L Ratnu has ruled out allocation of schools as per choice of parents. “There are clear guidelines on what category students should be given priority. For instance, orphans, destitutes and children of migrant workers have to be given priority after which students of   category are allotted schools,” he said. 
 
 Parents, however, also highlighted some technical goof-ups in allocation of schools which was done through centralised process. 
 
 For instance, a student who had applied for admission in English medium school was allotted admission in school that offers Gujarati medium and so on. 
 
 “In such cases, we have asked the parents to submit written objection letters to us on Thursday. We will take up the issue with our   office for re-allotment of schools to such children,” he said, adding that the office will personally take up the matter and get it resolved. 
 
 Of the 4,200 admissions granted under the RTE this year, the DEO office has received 952 applications from parents seeking change in schools.
