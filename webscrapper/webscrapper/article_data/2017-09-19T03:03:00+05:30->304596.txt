Margao/Karwar: The bodies of three more people who had gone missing at the   falls near Karwar on Sunday, were recovered on Monday. 

 They were identified as those of Marcelina Estibeiro, 38, from Curtorim, Sameer Gaude, 32, from Keri-Ponda, and Siddu Chari, 22, from Vasco. Gaude’s and Chari’s bodies were recovered after district authorities, with the help of local people, went on a search operation. A group comprising members of the General Thimmaiah Adventure Academy, led by Prakash Harikantra, Jilla Janashakhti Vedike, Madhav Naik and others, recovered them from the Seabird area, almost 5km from Nagarmadi falls. 
 
 Estibeiro’s body was found near a prawn-rearing farm. All three were moved to Goa following a postmortem examination at Karwar. 
 
 While the bodies of Frenzila Pires, 21, and Fiona Pacheco, 29, were located on Sunday itself, search operations to trace the sixth missing personRenuka Naik from Borda, Margaoare still on. Sources said her body may have been swept into the Arabian Sea.
 
 The authorities, meanwhile, are trying to put a finger on what caused the flash flood. They said that while water passes through two large boulders at Nagarmadi, resulting in the falls, it is suspected that a log may have gotten wedged between the boulders, causing a large quantity of water to build up.
 
 The bodies of Pires and Pacheco, both from Raia, were brought to Goa late Sunday night after a postmortem exam at the Civil Hospital, Karwar. They were laid to rest on Monday.
