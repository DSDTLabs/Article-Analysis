HYDERABAD: After the Peacock   turning toxic,   (UoH) students are now up in arms against the discharge of sewage water into a pit near the School of Life Sciences. They fear that the rising levels of pollution in the trench will endanger wildlife on campus.

 According to students, contaminated water discharged from a swanky residential complex located in the vicinity, has been draining into this pit for the last few days.
 
  
  
 
 “We don’t understand why the university is acting as a sewage collecting agent. The groundwater in north campus has already been polluted due to the discharge of waste water by the   stadium, IIIT, Hill Ridge Villa, Ella Hotels since 2002. Now, this housing complex is doing the same to the south campus. They have directly constructed a sewage sump within the varsity land and are pumping the sewage water,” said  , founder of  , a wildlife protection group at UoH pointing out how this contaminated water is making its way into other areas too as pipeline at this point is damaged.
 
 He added: “The peacocks and spotted deer on campus are consuming this polluted water. Such activities will ultimately destroy biodiversity at UoH.”
 
 In their defence, varsity authorities said that the water being collected in this trench is treated sewage water and poses no threat.
 
 As per a survey conducted by the Wild Lens team, there are over 200 species of birds, apart from spotted deer, hare, rabbits, wild boars, monitor lizards and mongoose within the university.
