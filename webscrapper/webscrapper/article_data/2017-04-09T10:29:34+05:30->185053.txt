PANAJI: The   has started the process of renewing liquor licences of vends, that fell within the prohibited area defined earlier, following a clarification issued by the government.

 An excise official confirmed renewal of licences of distributors and wholesalers who have been exempted by the government.
 
 In its March 31 order, the   held that the 500 metres parameter will not be applicable to towns with a population of 20,000 and less.
 
 This means that the excise department is now at liberty to renew licences of liquor vends located beyond 220 metres of either a state or national highway, provided that the town in question has a population 20,000 or less.
 
 The government held that since wholesalers and distributors are not selling directly to consumers, licences at such stores be excluded from the ambit of the   order.
 
 Some 3,200 licences were not renewed due to the SC order., but there was some relief when the SC modified its earlier order on Friday.
 
 The excise official said they have instructed excise inspectors to renew licences of vends that are situated beyond 220 meters of a national or state highways, in villages with less than 20,000 population.
 
 “Excise officials have been given lists of liquor vends within their respective jurisdictions and exact location of their vends,” said the excise official, adding, “The department would know the exact number of licenses renewed only next week.”
