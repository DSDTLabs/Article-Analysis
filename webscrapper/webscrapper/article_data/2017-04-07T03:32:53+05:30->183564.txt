NEW DELHI: NDA ally Shiv Sena threatened to boycott the NDA meeting and dinner scheduled to be hosted by PM   on April 10 unless the flying ban imposed on its MP   was successfully resolved. 

 The Sena posture came after its MPs raised a ruckus in   coming close to roughing up civil aviation minister Gajapati Raju. There was some speculation over the ban being lifted and later it became clear that Gaikwad had regretted his action. The boycott threat was announced by Sena MP and spokesperson  , who said it was a decision taken by party chief Uddhav Thackaray.
 
 As Lok Sabha was caught up for the day with parleys on the Gaikwad episode, Speaker   held a meeting with TDP and Sena MPs including Raju and Geete and with Union home minister Rajnath Singh to seek a compromise, after adjourning the House.
 
 According to TDP sources, Mahajan expressed displeasure over the behaviour of Sena MPs inside the House, saying it is "not acceptable". After her meeting, Mahajan said, "I am not a judge and cannot pass judgement on this issue. But, the matter should be resolved amicably".
