The incomplete syllabus due to a strike by teaching and non-teaching staff at   (STES) has resulted in a relay   by the students. The   students have chosen to go on strike at the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) campus, to ensure that the authorities take the issue seriously and resolve the matter by Tuesday, failing which, they have threatened to go on an indefinite hunger strike.

 Last week Pune Times reported that an ongoing strike by the teaching and non-teaching staff of most of the institutes under the society, resulted in barely 10 days of lectures over the past two months. The staffs have been on strike since December 18 because of salary arrears. Now, the students have demanded a solution to the issue between teaching staff and the institute. 
 
 “Despite promises to solve the issues on time by  , the vice chancellor and N Umarani, Pro VC of SPPU, there has been no resolution as yet. So we have decided to go on a relay hunger strike. If the problem is not resolved by Tuesday, we will be forced to go on an indefinite hunger strike,” said Nasiroddin Sayyed, a student of Sinhgad Institute, Narhe campus.
 
  
 SPPU has formed a committee that is visiting the STES campus and preparing a report regarding the issues. Following this, the university will take a decision. “The varsity had called the management of STES for a meeting. In the first meeting they promised to pay the due   in a few days, but failed to do so. Following this, SPPU has sent their representatives to look into the matter. The varsity will be taking a decision based on their report,” says N Umarani, Pro VC of SPPU.
 The teachers, who have grown weary of waiting for their salaries, have threatened to join the students in the hunger strike. Sachin Shinde, a representative of the staff says, “We are hopeful that there will be solution soon and will wait till Tuesday. If there is no solution, will will join the students in the hunger strike.”
