MUMBAI: Scamsters who pose as bank representatives, seek account details and siphon off money have not spared   ( ) employees too. 

 On Wednesday, a senior   lost Rs 10,000 after he shared his account details with a ‘bank telecaller’, who threatened to block his debit   for not updating his know your customer (KYC) details. Police said that after the 32-year-old assistant general manager shared his bank details, the fraudster used it to make two online shopping payments worth Rs10,000. “The victim shared the details as he got scared his card would get blocked. He did not bother to verify the caller’s authenticity,” said an officer from the BKC police station.
 
 The victim, a Navi Mumbai resident, learnt about the fraud when he received transaction alerts on his mobile at 1.52pm. He said that the fraudster had called him around 9.30am when he had just reached office. In the complaint, the Sebi officer said, “I was at my workplace when I received a call from a woman who claimed to be a bank tele-caller. She identified herself as Priya. She informed me that my debit card was about to be blocked and asked me to share my three-digit CVV number.”
 
 “After receiving alerts for two transactions—Rs4,985 and Rs4,987, the victim called up his bank and got the card blocked before lodging a police complaint,” said the investigators.
 
 A case under Indian Penal Code sections 419 (impersonation) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property); and under IT Act’s Section 66 (D) (cheating by impersonation using computer resource) has been registered against the unidentified person.
