 The 34-year-old, who last played the titular role in the ‘Ben-Hur’ remake, is being considered to play the part. The producers of the hugely successful series are reportedly on a hunt to find a “great actor” to take the franchise forward. Jack, being the right age and having proved his acting capabilities, is believed to have what it takes to carry the series forward- should he do a good job playing the part. 
 
 Before Jack, Golden Globe award winning actor   was rumoured to be the front-runner to play the spy. Actors Michael Fassbender, Tom Hardy, Tom Hiddleston were also reportedly in the running to play the iconic role.
