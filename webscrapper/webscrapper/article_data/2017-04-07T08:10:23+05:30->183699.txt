PUNE: A further 30,000 consumers in the city will have access to low-cost piped natural gas (PNG), with the Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited ( ) set to lay an 25-30 additional kilometres of PNG pipeline by this month-end. 

 In the last two years, MNGL has expanded its network to areas like Kothrud, Model Colony, Shivajinagar, Vimannagar and Kalyaninagar. "This year, we plan to expand further not only in these areas, but also to Sinhagad road, Bibvewadi, Baner, Pashan, Bavdhan and Balewadi," A M Tambekar, MNGL's managing director, told TOI. 
 
 According to MNGL officials, the   granted permission for the pipeline only towards the end of March, prompting MNGL to request an extension of the deadline to June 15.
 
 "The working period for all utilities in Pune is from October 1 to April 30. However, since we received the permission quite late, we requested an extension. The Centre has a target of 1 lakh PNG connections in the current fiscal, so we expect cooperation from the civic body," Tambekar said.
 
 MNGL will consequently lay the proposed 25-30 km PNG network during this month, benefiting 25,000-30,000 customers. "We urge the PMC to consider the time lapse of six months in issuing the permission, and grant us the extension," Tambekar said.
 
  Promoting green fuel 
 
 To promote green fuel in Pune, the MNGL has conducted awareness campaigns through various media as well as through housing society meetings, door-to-door visits and interactions with people. "MNGL has spent Rs 18,000-20,000 per household to ensure that people in the city get to utilize green fuel and thus reduce pollution," he said.
 
  No freebies, says MNGL
