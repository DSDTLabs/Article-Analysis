JALANDHAR: Union HRD minister   said on Saturday that public and private sectors in education could coexist. Speaking at the Management Conclave-2017 and annual honouring ceremony being held at   (LPU), Javadekar said the Union government was working on public-private partnerships ( ) where competition and collaboration between the two would bring out the best of India.

 “We feel, whether government or private, only good institutions will flourish and bad will go. More good an institution, more autonomy it will have. Survive through competition and that is only the 21st Century India,” he said.
 
 However, he admitted that it was a real challenge to improve government education sector and the government was striving for that. “Here I can say that both public and private sectors can co-exist and make India prosper. We want good education to all,” the HRD minister said.
 
 Laying stress on innovation and research, Javadekar asked all teachers and students to bring out new ideas. “We are the fastest growing country in the world. To keep up pace, innovate what is not existing. Research and develop and have as many patents as you can for the betterment of the society. We have great merit based scholarships for our students to retain best of brains in the country by following ‘brain gain and no brain drain’.”
 
 Meanwhile on this occasion,   Ashok Mittal held that the minister’s visit to a private university affirmed the confidence government had in the private sector. “We shall never betray this faith,” he said.
