NEW DELHI: Opposition parties on Tuesday boycotted   in the post-lunch session, protesting Chairman  's decision to adjourn proceedings for a longer period due to disruptions, saying their voice was being muzzled in Parliament. 

  With the opposition keeping away, Naidu defended his decision and said he was deeply concerned about negative perception in the public due to repeated adjournments and that of the 42 zero hour submissions admitted in the last three working days, only one could be made. Sufficient warnings had been issued before the House was adjourned till afternoon, he said. 
 
 Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad led the charge and said Parliament worked according to "rules, regulations, procedures and conventions" and not "according to one's whims".
 
 He was supported by other opposition leaders, including  's Naresh Agarwal,  's Derek O'Brien and CPM's  . Deputy chairman P J Kurien said the chair's decisions could not be questioned in the House and aggrieved members should meet him in the chamber.
 
  At this, an enraged Azad announced that the opposition was boycotting the House for the day and the entire opposition walked out. Kurien adjourned the House till 3 pm. 
 
 MPs from Congress, TMC, NCP, DMK, Samajwadi Party, CPM, CPI and AAP stayed away from the House when proceedings resumed at 3 pm after two adjournments during the day.
 
 In his remarks later in the day, Naidu said, "Leaders of several parties have conveyed their anguish to me over how they are being deprived of their right to raise issues of concern to them as some parties strategise for disruptions leading to forced adjournments."
 
 Opposition MPs were not present when Naidu spoke.
