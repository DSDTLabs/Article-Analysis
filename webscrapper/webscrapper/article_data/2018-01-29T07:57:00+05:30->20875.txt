NOIDA: Around 4,000 home buyers in an apartment complex in Noida’s Sector 110 have launched a campaign on Twitter to protest the alleged delay on the part of the developer to hand over flats.

 The buyers of flats at   said the campaign — #4000HomelessFamilies — was a run-up to a demonstration they had planned on February 3 outside the houses of two of three of the directors of the company, 3C. The home buyers had recently demonstrated outside the house of one of the directors in Delhi. 
 
 “There are three directors in 3C and we have protested in front of the houses of one. We want to take this protest further. So, on February 3, we will hold silent demonstrations outside the houses of the two remaining directors,” said Amit  , a buyer.
 
 Most buyers who participated in the social media campaign over the weekend have asked for a clarity on the delivery of the flats.
 
 Of the 30 towers of Lotus Panache, only 9 have been handed over so far. These nine towers house around 1,000 residents. Around 4,000 flats are awaiting delivery.
 
 The builder had earlier said the construction of the flats was in progress and they would be delivered in time. In the RERA registration, the builder has committed to a 2022 deadline.
 
 “We have sought the chief minister’s attention on the issue. We want the   to disclose to the public all details found in a research conducted by them on some builders,” Chauhan said.
 
 “The social media campaign has been successful in its outreach. We will sustain it. Most buyers are paying an EMI and a rent and are under financial pressure,” said Arpit Kapoor, another buyer.
