Actress  , who was noticed for her performance in Jos Thomas' Swarnakaduva, is all excited about bagging yet another plum role, in Ranjith's Mammootty-starrer Puthenpanam.

  And playing a central character in a film that has prominent personalities of M-Town in it has definitely been an icing on the cake, says the actress. While she is not sure how much details she can let out, Ineya says hers is a role which runs parallelly with that of  's character, and she also has combination scenes with him. 'I play the role of Sundari, a traditional Tamil girl, who is one of the central characters of the film,' she says.
 Ask her how she fetched the role and Ineya explains, 'It was Swarnakaduva which paved the way for the role. After watching the movie, its scriptwriter Babu Janardhanan got a call from Ranjith sir, asking for my number. Babu sir later wished my luck.'
 
 And how was it to act with Mammootty? 'He is generally very serious but one can never predict when he would turn witty. He treats everyone with dignity, and his persona instills in others a sense of respect towards him.' 
 
 The shoot of the film started off last month, in Ernakulam. Parts of the film are being shot in Tamil Nadu as well to match the Tamil background.
 In the pipeline for her is her Tamil project Sadhura Adi 3,500, and a Tamil-Telugu project, which is not titled yet. Her horror flick Pottu, alongside Bharath is prepping up for a release.
