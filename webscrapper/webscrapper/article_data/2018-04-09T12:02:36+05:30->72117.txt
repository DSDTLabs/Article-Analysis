RAJKOT: A fortnight-long quarrel between two persons over selling grass resulted in brutal double murder near Kotharia Solvent on Sunday.

 The victim   Shiyaliya (45) and his cousin brother Veja Algotar (35) were attacked by around eight persons armed with knives, sickles, swords, pipes and sticks when they were having tea at a stall tea opposite the former’s roadside grass kiosk at   Crossroads.
 
 Jesing and Veja were rushed to the civil hospital where the former died within few hours. Veja, who had suffered suffered serious head injuries after being hit by the sickle, died in the evening. 
 
 Rajkot taluka police arrested the assailants   (41), his son Vishal alias Lalo (19) and brother   (27) when they were going in a car towards Junagadh on Gondal Road. Other accused   alias Gigo Bharwad and two unidentified persons are still on the run.
 
 The victims as well as the assailants are residents of Rasulpura.
 
 Police said that Jesing was selling green and dry grass near Dholra crossroads for past eight years. Fifteen days back,   Shiyaliya also started the same business near Jesing’s kiosk. This resulted in friction between the duo as Jesing requested him not to do business near his place. Both are distant relatives.
 
 There used to be heated altercation between the duo almost daily over selling grass there. Mela then decided to bump off Jesing and attacked him brutally.
