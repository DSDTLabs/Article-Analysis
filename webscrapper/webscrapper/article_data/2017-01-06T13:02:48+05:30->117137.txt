 The department is going to closely monitor the flow of money in the run-up to the elections, besides investigating the cases related to black money and conversion of banned currency notes after demonetisation.
 
 Speaking to TOI, a high-ranking officer of the department said, “The elections have been announced at a juncture when we are looking into the offences post demonetization. It is definitely not going to be easy, especially in the wake of amended standard operating procedures (SOPs) but we are used to such challenges.”
 
 Unlike the previous elections when only cash seizures above Rs 10 lakh were reported to the I-T department, this time it has been made mandatory for police and   to share info about any cash interception with the Income tax department regardless of the amount.
