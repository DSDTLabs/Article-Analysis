AHMEDABAD:  , 39, resident of Satyam Apartment in Shahibaugh was nabbed by the   for theft of around eight scooters from different areas of the city. The police have recovered all the   as Jain used to abandon them after use. 

 How Jain took to stealing vehicles is another story. Police said that about 11 years ago, Jain used to own a small business. 
 
 “He fell in love with a girl and even married her,” a crime branch official said. “They had a happy married life until about two-and-a-half years ago when they started quarrelling over petty matters. His wife had enough of it and one day she left her husband for her parent’s house with her two daughters.” Inspector of crime branch Sahil Tandel said that after that Jain took to alcohol and lost his business too. “He started stealing scooters,” the inspector said. “He would drive the vehicle until its petrol was exhausted and then abandon it. He would then steal another scooter from the same place and ply it till it ran out of fuel.”
