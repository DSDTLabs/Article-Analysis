MARGAO: Even if the rivals don’t score,   will somehow conspire to concede one of their own. FC Goa’s shambolic defending was the centre of attention again as   had more than just a foot in the semifinals of the   after registering a 1-0 victory at the   in Fatorda on Thursday.

 
 Inigo Calderon was eventually credited with the 52nd minute match winner but the goal could have so easily been credited to FC Goa’s defence. The home defenders simply left   unmarked and then appeared to make a mess of the clearance as Bruno Pinheiro and Narayan Das got tangled amongst themselves. In the confusion, Pinheiro appeared to direct the ball towards his own goal where Calderon, unwittingly, got the final touch.
 
 
 The goal was enough for Chennaiyin to pocket three points and take a giant leap towards the playoffs with 27 points from 15 matches.
