GHAZIABAD: Markets and   are all decked out to cater to the youngsters a day ahead of Valentine’s Day. Various stores have come up with exciting offers,   and discounts. 

 While some youngsters have their plans in place for the day, many youngsters in the city seem to have let Valentine’s Day celebrations take a backseat. Speaking to TOI, Shweta Sanyal (28), a resident of Shipra Sun City, said, “I am not doing anything special. My husband and I find this occasion highly overrated. We have been married for four years and like to call every day a ‘Valentine’s Day’.”
 
 However, despite the prevalent mood of pessimism, foodies and fashionistas did not fail to make a mark. 
 
 “I work with a British firm in Gurgaon and I love fashion. I am here to visit my boyfriend and have bought a special dress to wear on the occasion,” said Vijaya Sundaram. 
 
 Dunkin Donuts in Shipra Mall is serving a special range of Valentine’s Day-inspired doughnuts. “We have three new types of doughnuts and have a special assorted box to accommodate them with a special place on the box to write your love message for your beloved,” said Keerty Bhatnagar from Dunkin Donuts.
 
 Apart from offering two burgers at a discounted Valentine’s Day price of Rs 99, an offer that has been up for grabs since last week, Burger King has also sponsored a game stall whose winners will be awarded with desserts.
 
 From multilayered cards, to soft toys, to small knick-knacks to gigantic teddy bears, premium gift store Archies Gallery has left no stone unturned. 
 
 On the security arrangements in the city, Deepak Kumar, SSP  , said, “More than 80% of our entire police force has been busy with elections and currently we have a dearth of police personnel. However, those who are available will be deployed around colleges, malls and other public places. We will take the help of the UP 100 services and alert them in case of any emergency.”
