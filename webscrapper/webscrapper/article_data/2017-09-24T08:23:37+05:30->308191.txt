AHMEDABAD: After promising   high court of completing vigilance inquiry and finishing the task of road resurfacing quickly,   ( ) is now seeking 45 more days to place its vigilance report.

 In its application, AMC has expressed apprehension that the inquiry at this juncture could disturb engineers who are answerable for the potholed roads and it might derail resurfacing of roads.
 
 AMC has stated, “It would be in the interest of things if the first concentration is given for the work of resurfacing of affected roads as soon as possible, and if the same officers are subjected to recording of their statements etc. by the vigilance committee, it would certainly affect and/or derail the work of resurfacing at site. Further, looking to the volume of work and the nature of inquiry, which is prescribed, the vigilance inquiry would take its own time.”
 
 Interestingly, AMC has suspended seven engineers over this issue. Since July 27, when the municipal commissioner ordered a vigilance inquiry, AMC has been able to analyse only three samples from 13 affected roads out of 90 roads that it has randomly selected to analyse construction quality. There are 231 roads in the city that have been badly affected during the rains.
 
 After promising quick vigilance inquiry, AMC has given another reason for delay in the inquiry, “If monsoon is on and if the material is not dry, it is not advisable and/or proper and/or permissible to take such samples, as the result of the laboratory test will not give perfect result.” AMC did not supply measurement books as directed by the   and could not show the action taken after the HC order. “AMC has acted absolutely in tune with the directions issued by the HC in its Aug 10 order and further actions are under process so as to reach to ultimate goal to surface all affected roads in city limits,” the application reads.
 
 The HC is likely to hear this application on Monday along with the PIL demanding inquiry and action on the potholed roads.
