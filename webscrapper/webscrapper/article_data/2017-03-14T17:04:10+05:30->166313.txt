MANMAD: Responding to a request made on Twitter,   promptly arranged milk for an infant who was feeling hungry while travelling in   on Sunday. 

 A couple, along with their 5-month-old baby (Kartiki), boarded the train on the way to Tirunelveli, when the milk they bought for the infant curdled due to the heat.
 
 Unfortunately, the trains next halt was at   station which was a few hours away. And to make matters more complicated, the train pantry was out of milk. 
 
 While the toddler continued to wail in hunger, a co-passenger Neha Bapat tweeted about the situation to her friends. Soon help started pouring in from Neha's friends across Mumbai, Pune, Ratnagiri and Nashik.
 
 One of Neha's friends, Anagha Nikam-Makdum sprung into action and tweeted the matter to Konkan Railways. 
  
  
 The railway officials immediately responded to the Tweet on social media and the couple was handed over a bag of milk at   station.
