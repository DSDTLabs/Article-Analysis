HYDERABAD: A banana seller in city's Moosarambagh, who never went to school, has joined the country's digital revolution. The 34-year-old who has been selling bananas on his pushcart for 18 years at Dilsukhnagar bus depot is suddenly a class apart at the Kothapet fruit market.

 A father of four, Ahmed Pasha, has begun accepting payments through   for even sale of a dozen bananas. A display board on his cart conspicuously draws customers. It has been a month since he embraced this technology. Speaking to TOI, Pasha said, "Every day, at least one or two customers want a  . When I realized that cash crunch was preventing people from buying the fruit, I decided to provide them the Paytm facility."
 
 While the cashless transaction facility has given him an edge among competitors, the   has left him embroiled in a problem.
 Hailing from a small village, 10 km from Bidar in Karnataka, Pasha sold land and deposited money in a bank. "There's such heavy rush at banks in Hyderabad that I deposited it in my village. Now, the bank is not allowing me to withdraw my own money," Pasha said. The bank, according to Pasha, has sought proof on ownership of land he sold. "I told the bank officials, I was willing to do that, but they froze my account. This is my plight. I have gone cashless, but I am unable to access my own money," he said.
 
 A look at his Paytm account shows Pasha has made transactions of even Rs 2, Rs 10, Rs 15 from sale of bananas.
 
 Though Pasha adopted cashless transactions, he is unable to pay the banana wholesaler digitally.
