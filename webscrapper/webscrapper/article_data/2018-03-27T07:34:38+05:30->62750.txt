CHANDIGARH: Snatchers have found a new way of disposing of the snatched and stolen jewellery. Besides directly approaching jewellers in the city or in neighbouring states, they now go to finance companies and banks and take loan against the jewellery.

 Police said the accused take loan against snatched gold chains from small jewellers in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab as well. The accused mostly offer the chains at half rates. Usually, drug addicts sell chains to jewellers.
 
 Last year, police arrested three members of Bawaria gang and recovered 21 gold chains from them and solved 40 cases of  . During their interrogation, the accused had revealed that they used to sell gold in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli in UP. Police said hundreds of jewellers purchase chains from snatchers, but it is difficult for cops to recover them as they mostly melt the gold or change the design.
 
 Cops said there are several small jewellers in Zirakpur, Mohali, Hallomajra and Raipur Khurd who accept gold chains from snatchers. Police had arrested some of them in the past.
 
 Police said drug addicts sold chains directly to drug peddlers to fulfil their habit. The crime branch had arrested two brothers Naman and   of Jalandhar who used to snatch chains to buy drugs. Both were involved in more than 15 case. The snatchers used to sell gold chains in small pieces so that they could not be arrested.
