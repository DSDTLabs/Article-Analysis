INDORE: If you have not   for the past three months, expect a recovery team from Madhya Pradesh   Company Ltd (MPPKVVCL) playing dumroos in front of your home, demanding to cough up the cash. 

 Faced with low collection and mounting pending bills, the company has started resorting to embarrass defaulters publically. Discom has come up with this unique 'Dumroo System' to shame defaulters into clearing their dues.
 
 'Dumroos' would be provided to each recovery team and they have been instructed to play it in front of the defaulter's house for at least ten minutes. Instructions were given to disconnect the supply and paste a notice stating that legal action would be issued if the bill is not paid. "Our recovery team has been instructed to play Dumroo (small drum) in front of the house of such defaulters," said superintendent engineer of discom  . The company is giving a clear message - "Pay up or it will send its ' ', and then everybody will know what you've done wrong." 
 
 The new system has started giving positive results. "There were defaulters who had not cleared their bills for the last six months and when our staff approached them playing dumroo, within hours they issue cheques to settle their arrears," they said while talking to TOI.
