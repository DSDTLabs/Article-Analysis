GHAZIABAD: A 30-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself in her parents’ home in Indirapuram on Monday.

 The woman, identified as Shivani Singh, was living with her parents Rajdev and Geeta Singh in Shipra Sun City, Indirapuram. Shivani had returned from Brisbane, Australia in November last year after divorcing her husband Sumit Kumar. No suicide note was found in the spot. The deceased was the only child of her parents.
 
 According to the police, Shivani was alone at home on Monday morning. “Mother Geeta was away in Meerut from Sunday while father Rajdev said he had gone to Vasundhara to file house tax on Monday. When he returned home around 11.45am, he found the main gate of the house open. Inside, he claimed he saw Shivani hanging by a belt from the upper latch of a door. He then informed the neighbours and the police,” said Balram Singh Yadav, sub-inspector, Shipra Sun City .
 
 Family members said Shivani was depressed ever since the breakdown of her marriage. “My daughter got married in 2011 and moved to Brisbane with her husband. They had a troubled relationship and she divorced him in 2016 and came back to live with us,” Rajdev told TOI. However, he refused to divulge information about her in-laws and their whereabouts.
 
 A case of suicide was registered at Indirapuram police station on Monday. Pradeep Traipathi, SHO of Indirapuram police station, said, “We found this case suspicious. The woman was not taken to hospital when her body was discovered. By the time we reached, her body was lying on the floor, so her body must have been taken down by her family members. There was also an injury near her mouth. When we offered to send the body to a hospital for a postmortem, her parents refused, and said they did not want any investigation into the matter.”
