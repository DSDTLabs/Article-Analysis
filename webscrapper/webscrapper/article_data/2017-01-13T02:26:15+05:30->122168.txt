MARGAO: Away from the spotlight and officialdom, the first Prime Minister of Indian origin to head a European country, Portugal’s  , sat down for a quiet five-course preplated meal at Margao’s Rua Abade Faria, in the house where his father   da   grew up.

 For the next two-and-ahalf hours on Thursday afternoon, over stories and memories, Costa spent time with his father’s family. “It was a relaxing meal. Two-and-a-half hours weren’t enough, but we managed to catch up with the good old times,” Anna Kaarina Jussilainen Costa, his first cousin told TOI. This was Costa’s second visit to his ancestral home — he last came here in the late ’70s.
 
 “We took him on a tour of the house and memories came flooding back to him. He recalled which corner of the house he would curl up to read when the family was taking a siesta. They stayed for around a month at that time,” Anna Kaarina said. From tiger prawns to pork loin and Malabar crab cake on top of mini utthapam to faux caviar with fish liquid centre, Costa relished everything, turning down alcohol to just sipwater. “I was amazed when every plate came back clean to the kitchen,” said chef Mahesh, whom the family had roped in from Radisson Blu, so that they could spend some time with their ‘Babush’.
 
 Not very comfortable with the security, protocol and media attention, Costa’s 78-year-old paternal aunt Sinikka Jussilainen Costa, was happy to spend some family time with her nephew whom she last met more than a decade ago. “This is exactly what he badly needed with his hectic schedule. I’m looking forward to visiting him again in  , whether he is in the same position or not,” Anna Kaarinasaid.
 
 If the family exchanged stories and memories, friends and well-wishers in the neighbourhood sent him stacks of books. The family also got a surprise in the morning, when the postman delivered two letters addressed to him from his fans, which were handed over to Costa.
