PANAJI: The random police checks conducted by   on instructions of the   ahead of the February 4 assembly election has been causing major inconvenience to commuters exiting the capital city over the past few days.

 On Saturday, Panaji police began checks at around 9pm at the Santa Monica jetty. They were looking for liquor, money, etc, being moved from one place to another to woo voters.
 
 Since checking of each vehicle can take several minutes, the result is a massive traffic jam that can reach the old secretariat and even beyond. Commuters complained that it took over an hour to cross the nakabandi.
 
 Shabeeb Ahmed, 23, a resident of Panaji who was stuck in traffic for more than an hour, told STOI that due to these random checks, people are facing major inconvenience. “I was travelling to Mapusa to attend a friend’s birthday. Since 9.30pm, I’ve been stuck in this jam,” said Ahmed. 
 
 Darshan Sangodkar from Porvorim complained about the slow pace of police checking. “They should have deployed more police staff for checking, so that the process is streamlined,” Sangodkar said adding, “They should have found other ways to speed up checking.” 
 
 Several commuters STOI spoke to said they had cancelled their evening plans thanks to the jam, and were instead just waiting to get out of it. 
 
 The checks have affected tourists too. A tourist from Mumbai lamented that the jam has thrown her plans into disarray — she had to get back to her hotel to leave Goa for the metro. 
 
 Others questioned the point of the operation. “What’s the point in checking if it’s being done only at one point,” Roque Carvalho, a commuter, asked.
