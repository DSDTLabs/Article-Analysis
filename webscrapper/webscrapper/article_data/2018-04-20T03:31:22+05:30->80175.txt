NAVI MUMBAI:  , the state's apex industrial development agency, has for the first time signed a tripartite agreement with individual industrial units in the   cluster and the operator of an effluent treatment plant to fix responsibility for treating waste entering water bodies. 

 Paving the way for MIDC to take over the worst maintained among the 25 common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) in the state, units in Taloja on Thursday agreed to shell out their share for upgradation and expansion of the plant. Taloja   members will contribute 25% or over Rs 18 crore of the approximately Rs 74 crore estimated cost to restore the non-performing plant. MIDC is in the final stages of giving the official nod to a bidder, for the maintenance of the project. It is imperative work begins at the earliest as a foul odour hangs over the entire area. The defunct state of the CETP has resulted in a pile-up of the effluent sludge from the cluster.
 
 Chairman of Taloja CETP's administrative board B D Ahire had convened an extraordinary general body meeting for the MIDC takeover of the CETP society and to ensure members contribute for the project.
 
 The apex green regulatory body for the state-Maharashtra   (MPCB)-had directed the MIDC to take over seven CETPs last year. MIDC superintending engineer Rajesh Zanzad, who is overseeing the Taloja CETP takeover, told TOI, "The Taloja plant will be modernised and it will have automatic checks for the quantum of COD at the inlet point of the CETP. This will help proper and ambient treatment of toxic waste ensuring green compliance as per MPCB norms.''
 
 Ahire, meanwhile, will filie an appeal in Supreme Court against the NGT order asking the cooperative society which was running the CETP to deposit Rs 5 crore with a magistrate before the next hearing on May 11.
