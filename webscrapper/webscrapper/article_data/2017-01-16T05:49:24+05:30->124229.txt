BENGALURU: The labour market in India is highly fragmented and unorganized, and that’s exactly the challenge that startups are tackling. Home services aggregator startups are building platforms that link citizens seeking services with semi-skilled professionals.

 Chief operating officer of home services aggregator Housejoy, Saran Chatterjee says, "The overall size of the industry is massive. There are many unorganized workers and the number of online platforms like ours are few. It is not enough to increase the number of job seekers on the platform.We created a huge supply by aggregating many service providers and later realized the demand is yet to catch up."
 
 These startups are trying to become the default option for people.  , co-founder of Timesaverz, says, "We focus on on-time quality service with no hidden costs. We’re trying to standardize the pillars on which the market stands—onboarding of service providers, quality of service delivered and remaining transparent about the price."
 
 Saran says pricing will be a big factor for startups in the segment. "To remain fair and transparent will be a challenge. Customers have choices and we should be careful to fix rates that are not just reasonable for the customer but also worthwhile for us," he says. "If we cut prices too much, quality of service will suffer." 
 
 All these startups do background checks on the service providers. "They act as deterrents and keep them from doing anything that puts them or the companies in legal wrangles," says Upadhyay.
