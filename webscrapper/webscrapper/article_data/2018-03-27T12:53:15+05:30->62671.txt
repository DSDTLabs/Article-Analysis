NAGPUR: Dismissing Archeological Survey of India’s (ASI) contention that entire area of ‘old HC building’ is a ‘monumental structure’, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Monday directed state PWD to demolish canteen and servants quarters on the premises within 48 hours to create parking space. The government was told to furnish compliance report by Wednesday. 

 The court’s directives came while hearing a PIL (No 67/2015) by petitioner Manoj Sable through counsel Shreerang Bhandarkar, praying for directives to the PWD for construction of additional infrastructure like courts and bar rooms at ‘Suyog’ building premises for convenience of lawyers and litigants.

 “We find that contention is without any substance. It is only an old HC building, which can be considered as either monumental or heritage structure. If ASI contention is to be accepted, the servants quarters would also be considered as monumental or heritage structure,” a division bench comprising justices   and   stated.
 
 The judges asked additional government pleader   to communicate the order to various authorities for compliance.
