MUMBAI: An   A320neo aircraft, which was operated on the Kochi-Delhi sector on Sunday, was grounded on landing following a technical problem with the left engine.

 
 The aircraft (VT ITK), had an ‘oil chip’ warning, which led the airline to ground it, said a source. The Pratt and Whitney manufactured engines of IndiGo A320neos, inducted from March 2016 onwards, have been hit by a number of technical problems, which have led to in-flight shutdowns, among other issues.
 
 An IndiGo spokesperson confirmed the grounding. “As part of troubleshooting, the aircraft was withdrawn at Delhi. This is a known issue with a prescribed solution and not an engine failure. Including this aircraft, IndiGo now has seven neos grounded,” the spokesperson said.
