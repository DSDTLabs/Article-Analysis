The government has complete majority in Parliament yet it has not been able to do enough for the protection of cows,” Togadia said. He then referred to Shaktisinh Gohil’s ancestor Hanubha. “Hanubha had sacrificed his life for the protection of cows and even today every child remembers him for this sacrifice,” added Togadia.
 
 Togadia also demanded a Uniform Civil Code in the country. “The Supreme Court has asked for a Uniform Civil Code yet nothing is being done. Instead a law against triple talaq was made. The government does not understand that if a common law is made then triple talaq will automatically become illegal,” he said.
 
 On Ram temple, Togadia said, “It was the wish of every Hindu that if a majority government of BJP comes to power, then Ram temple should be built. I believe I can tell this to my elder brother Narendra Modi,” he said told mediapersons here.
