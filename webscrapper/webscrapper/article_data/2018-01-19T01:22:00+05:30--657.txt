Chennai: Three service vice-chiefs who are in Chennai to participate in a meeting of industries and the defence ministry have appreciated the prowess of small and medium companies in Coimbatore. They said they were not aware of the organisation called Coimbatore District Small Industries Association ( ) when it was mentioned at a meeting of FICCI, CII and Assocham and defence ministry officials recently in New Delhi. 

 “A few months back we had an interaction with the industrial associations and at that meeting we were asked about Codissia and none of us including me had any knowledge about it,” said Army vice-chief Lt Gen Sarath Chand. He said Codissia was a grouping of 5,000 small companies in one district and the largest of its kind in the country. 
 
 “Codissia on its own has come forward to establish a Rs 100-crore defence industrial complex without any external support. The state government must take a cue from Codissia and establish a special defence manufacturing zone on the lines of special economic zone to facilitate production of defence needs,” said Lt Gen Chand. 
 
 “Coimbatore has enormous skill and along with Tamil Nadu’s enormous intellectual resources must be put together for products in metallurgy and solids. My office is open to clear any doubts MSMEs may have on producing products for defence equipment,” said Air Force vice-chief Air Marshal S B Deo. An MSME had provided platform booster for ISRO which was a great achievement, he added.
