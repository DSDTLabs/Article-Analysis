PATIALA: The   (NIA) on Monday formally arrested Dharmender Singh alias   in connection with the murder of right-wing Hindu leader Amit Sharma and produced him before special   court in Mohali. He was sent him to six-day police remand.

 Guggni is named as an accused in the targeted killings that took place in Punjab after it was discovered that he arranged weapons used in the crimes. A leader of the organisation called ‘Hindu Takhat,’ Amit, had been gunned down by two unidentified assailants near Durga Mata Mandir in Ludhiana on January 14, 2017. The case is now being investigated by the NIA.
 
 The NIA also produced Amit Kala, manager of Ludhiana-based petrol pump owned by Guggni’s family, who is already under arrest and sought his remand. The agency’s plea was dismissed by the court and Kala was sent back to Ludhiana jail.
 
 Kala was arrested after the Moga police carried out a raid at the petrol pump owned by Guggni’s family and seized some illegal weapons from there. Amit Agnihotri, counsel for Guggni and Kala, said they did not oppose the petition moved by the NIA as they wanted to fully cooperate with the investigating agency. Following the court hearing, the NIA took Guggni to Delhi headquarters for interrogation.
 
 Name of Guggni, from Meharban village in Ludhiana, had cropped up in investigations conducted by the state police into the targeted killings, after the cops arrested Jimmy from IGI Airport on October 31. His interrogation brought out the names of Jagtar Singh Johal alias Jaggi and Guggni, who was at that time lodged in Nabha maximum security jail.
