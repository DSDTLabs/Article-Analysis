VISAKHAPATNAM: The state government is taking steps to tackle the   issue that has been threatening RK Beach and has also been posing danger to visitors. The government has already approached experts from Netherland-based  , who will, in collaboration with the National Institute of Ocean Technology, conduct a study to propose remedial measures to the problem. The institute will also help implement those measures. The   will be contributing Rs 100 crore towards this project. 

 NIOT has previously restored one of the beaches in Puducherry.
 
 Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), NIOT and Deltares will be hold a meeting in the next couple of weeks to sign the final agreement.
 
 In the last four years, erosion has emerged as a major threat to the beaches in the city. The problem was first reported in 2013 at RK Beach. 
 
 “The wave conditions and others aspects will be studied for four seasons (12 months) to know the exact cause of the erosion. But we are asking them to complete the study as early as possible. Earlier, experts had proposed to build an underwater wall to check the erosion. But Deltares ruled out the idea,” district collector   told TOI. 
 
 A senior revenue officers said that the measures suggested by Deltares can arrest beach erosion. However, other sources claim that local authorities will find it difficult to implement their suggestions. 
 
 According to sources, the measures to check beach erosion will be implemented from next year. The inclusion of NIOT in the study will help them learn the subject and attend to similar issues in the country.
