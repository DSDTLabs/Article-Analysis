QUEPEM: Three separate mishaps were reported in Quepem taluka on Friday.

 In the first incident, a mentally disturbed woman set a house ablaze at Igramoll. The woman, identified as  , set fire to a house during the wee hours when the family had gone to Canacona. A good half of the front portion of the locked house was damaged. The fire was noticed by a neighbour at around 2.30am, and the Curchorem fire station was informed. The fire-fighting personnel arrived at 3am and immediately doused the fire. Curchorem station fire officer   told   that the loss is estimated around Rs 20,000 but the cause of fire was not known.
 
 However, neighbours caught Onton, who admitted to the crime. The owner of the house did not register any police complaint since the lady is known to be mentally disturbed. 
 
 In another incident, students from Pope   high school had a miraculous escape as a dry tree on the edge of   canal got uprooted and fell on the road leading to the school, just before school hours. At some point during the night, unknown persons are suspected to have set fire around the tree which is inside the retaining wall of the irrigation canal. The wall was built for the safety of the school children. 
 
 Parents of school children blamed the irrigation department for the incident as the department failed to identify and cut trees that are dying to avoid any disaster.
 
 In the third incident, a truck proceeding to Curchorem rammed into an electricity pole near the Quepem civil and criminal court, disrupting the traffic. No injury was reported. Quepem police said that the accident occurred around 5am when the driver lost control of the vehicle.
