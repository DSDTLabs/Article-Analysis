NABINAGAR (AURANGABAD):   head constable Rajesh Singh took extremely   as an SPG commando before joining the security force, but when it came to real test, it was ‘banguri dao’ (a wrestling trick) that helped him overpower a distinctly superior challenger Balvir Singh, the CISF constable who ran amok on the   premises on Thursday, killing four of his colleagues.

 Narrating the incident, Rajesh told TOI on Friday that it was not the commando training that helped him overpower Balvir, but the wrestling trick. “My father was a wrestler who transferred some tricks of the trade to me. One such trick was ‘banguri dao’ that targets the rival’s elbow to floor him,” Rajesh said. As the scuffle between Balvir and Rajesh continued, Rajesh suddenly recalled the ‘dao’ (trick) and floored Balvir, whose   rifle too fell some distance away. Once Balvir was floored, the other cops, who were hiding for safety, emerged and handed him over to the Aurangabad police.
 
 Acknowledging Rajesh’s bravery, CISF officiating DG R K Mishra on Friday announced a cash reward of Rs 25,000 for him. Mishra, who visited Aurangabad to take stock of the situation, did not reveal much. He said only the investigating officer of the case can ascertain the cause of the killings.
