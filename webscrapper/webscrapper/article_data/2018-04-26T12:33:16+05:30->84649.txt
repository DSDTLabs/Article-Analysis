VADODARA: The Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train is expected to have two terminals in the western and eastern parts of the city. 

 TOI had earlier reported that Vadodara is one amongst three stations of bullet train project in   where the train will stop during both its limited and standard services. While the western terminal will come up at near platform six on the Alkapuri side, the eastern terminal is expected to come up towards the Sayajigunj side. 
 
 Officials from   (NHSRCL), the implementing agency of the project, said that the plan of setting up the eastern terminal is expected to get a final nod in a couple of days. Once approved, 24,000 sq m land will be required to set up this terminal, which will be larger than the one on the eastern side where ther is space crunch.
 
 Officials said that a major parcel of this land belongs to the railways while nearly 5,000 square metres land will be provided by the   (VMC) by vacating the   area. 
 
 “There will be multi-layer parking and booking facilities available on both the terminals,” said a NHSRCL official. 
 
 From the eastern terminal, passengers will be able to reach the boarding point near the platform number six using a walkway. To ensure smoother traffic flow, there will be circular traffic movement near the eastern terminal while the VMC has proposed to widen the   railway underbridge so that more traffic can move towards to and fro from the terminals.
