CHENNAI: A day after CITU and 9 other trade unions in   announced indefinite strike from February 16, state power minister P Thangamani requested the CPM-affiliated union to participate in the talks on February 12 and withdraw the strike call.

 The CITU and government are at loggerheads over the wage settlement as the unions want the agreement to be finalized immediately. Government, on the other hand, wants to finalise the work load of each employee before announcing the hike.
 
 The   government, which accused the DMK of instigating transport workers to go on strike last month, today praised the DMK-led union in TNEB for behaving responsibly and accepting the interim relief. He said the DMK-led union had accepted the interim relief and did not announced any protest, taking into consideration peoples’ welfare.
 
 “CITU and   have some ulterior agenda and want to bring bad name for the government. There are no fissures between the government and unions and all are working for salary hike and the CITU must give up its strike call and participate in the talks,” Thangamani told reporters at the secretariat.
 
 He denied charges of NGO Arappor Iyakkam on the import of coal. “We import coal at $ 92 per tonne whereas   gets it at $ 116 per tonne. The import is done only through MMTC. CBI has not charged TNEB though some private companies have been charged,” said Thangamani.
