NEW DELHI: With   scrapping their disqualification, the 20   MLAs will now be able to exercise all the powers that they are entitled to on their post. The first sign of this was seen when many of the legislators attended the ongoing budget session of Delhi assembly after the court judgment.

 The MLAs will now be able to return to their constituency functions and can also access their local area development fund.
 
 When the disqualification notification came into effect on January 20, the legislators were immediately stripped off their powers to direct the executive to carry out development or policy-related functions. Even their salaries were stopped. They couldn’t participate in any meetings of the assembly committees where they had been nominated as members.
 
 At that time, the AAP government had emphasised that the disqualified MLAs will work as volunteers in their area. While no administrative work has been disrupted over these two months, sources in the government said that the fact that 20 assembly constituencies were without MLAs was a cause for concern.
 
 Some of the problems that emerged were that the disqualified MLAs could not reach out to the public and give them assurances in an official capacity for local development works or address their problems. “Now that their offices will open again, people will be able to reach out to them with their concerns,” a senior AAP functionary said.
 
 The legislators felt that people had become restless in the past two months as they didn’t have a representative to approach on problems like sealing. Also, people seeking recommendations had to be turned away and this upset them. TNN
