AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat Fair Price Shop Owners’ Association on Monday held a protest march against the government, alleging that their long pending demands including higher commission from   have not been considered by the state regime.

 Prahlad Modi, the president of the Gujarat Fair Price Shop Owners’ Association, on Monday was at the rally in the Amraiwadi and Hatkeshwar areas of the city along with hundreds of fair price shop owners. Fair Price Shop owners are on indefinite strike since March 1.
 
  
  “We submitted a list of demands to the state government, including raising commission from foodgrain sales to bring it at par with states like Rajasthan, Delhi, Maharashtra, Kerala and Goa. However, the government is not only turning a deaf ear to us but it has also instructed the concerned DSOs (District Supply Officers) to cancel licences of all shop owners who have joined our protest,” said Modi, the brother of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 The commission given to fair price shop owners in Gujarat is Rs 85 per quintal. It is Rs 200 in Rajasthan and Delhi, Rs 220 in Kerala, Rs 150 in Maharashtra and Rs 230 in Goa, added Modi.
 
 Modi said the shop owners had been deprived of income due to the policy of the Central and state governments to reduce the use of kerosene and instead supply gas under the Ujjwala Yojana.
 
 Fair Price Shop owners also demanded that the government provide financial assistance for the education of their children.
