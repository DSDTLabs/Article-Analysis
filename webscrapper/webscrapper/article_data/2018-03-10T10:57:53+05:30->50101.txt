SURAT: A 50-year old diamond worker was booked for allegedly assaulting his wife, daughter and son-in-law in   area late on Thursday.

 Accused Ravji  , who lives in Chamundanagar Society, wanted to throw them out of the house so that he could bring his paramour to live with him.
 
 Kapodara police station officials said Rangani had been forcing his wife   to return to her native town   near Rajkot after his mother died four years ago. However, she refused to go and continued to live on the ground floor of their two-storey house.
 
 Early on Thursday morning when Chanda, his daughter   and her husband   were asleep, Rangani attacked them with knife and stabbed them. He fled from the house after attacking them. However, they received minor injuries.
 
 He was booked for attempt to murder. “Rangani has a second wife, who lives outside Surat and he wanted to bring her home. Chanda knew about this and refused to return to Jasdan,” the police said.
