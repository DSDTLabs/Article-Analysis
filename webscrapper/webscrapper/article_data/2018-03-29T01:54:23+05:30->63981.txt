NEW DELHI: A gang involved in theft of   from the newly operational   of   has been busted. Four men, all of whom worked at   sites, have been arrested for committing thefts. Police said that the men worked as daily wage labourers at the sites and were aware of the entry and exit points, which helped them in making away with the cables.

 Police said that the accused were Dilshad (22), Ali Hasan (23), Imran (27) and Saddam (24). Dilshad and Ali Hasan were ex-labourers of a project company of DMRC, police claimed.
 
 DCP (metro) Pankaj Singh said that in the last month, many incidents of cable thefts were reported from the metro line, due to which the DMRC had been facing difficulties to continue the operations. On March7 , a DMRC official Praveen Gupta got five cases of cable theft registered and stated that all those occurred from between 23 January and 5 March. “Cases were registered and we immediately formed a team,” said Singh.
 
 Police received information that the accused would come near Kalindi Kunj, from wthe men arrested. The men were, at that time, going to dispose of the stolen cable in a Mahindra Tempo. Two country-made pistols were also recovered from them.
 
 During interrogation the gang leader Dilshad told the cops that he along with Hasan were both involved in petty thefts of iron ore and scrap that got collected while working at the site. After completion of the project, they took to cutting   and stealing them. The cables would be transported through Saddam’s tempo, and delivered to Imran.
 
 Police said that they are looking for the rest of the accused men.
