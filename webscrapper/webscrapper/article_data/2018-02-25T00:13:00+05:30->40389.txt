Trichy: Buoyed by the success of existing microcompost yards which are playing a vital part of decentralised solid waste management (SWM) in collecting, segregating and recycling process, the Trichy Corporation has planned to open seven more microcompost yards in all four zones.

 The civic body’s pilot project was first established in Pookollai near Gandhi Market in August 2016. After its success, the corporation launched 23 microcompost yards with funding from central and state governments across the four zones covering around 40 of the total 65 wards in the city.
 
 Corporation officials said each of the 23 units is provided with compost pits with water facility, shredding machine and incinerator to identify, segregate and process biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. Biodegradable waste would be converted into compost in 45 days and subsequently sold to farmers and residents interested in terrace gardening at free of cost. 
 
 The non-biodegradable waste segregated would be sold to scrap dealers for a price which would be distributed among sanitary workers. Microcompost yards already are believed to have brought down 50% of the city’s daily domestic waste heading to the corporation’s massive dumpyard in Ariyamangalam through decentralised waste collection and disposal.
 
 “We have planned to increase the number of microcompost centres from 23 to 30 this year. By doing so, we can ensure at least 50 wards are covered under the microcompost centres through which waste would be collected at door step,” corporation commissioner N Ravichandran said. Locations for the seven compost yards are said to be identified in Srirangam, K Abishekapuram, Ponmalai, and Ariyamangalam zones. Trichy Corporation has also planned to bring down the number of bins at public spot gradually in the wards where microcompost yards were established.
