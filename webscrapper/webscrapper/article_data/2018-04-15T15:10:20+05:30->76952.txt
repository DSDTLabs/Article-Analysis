 is enjoying a quiet   with her fur babies and good food keeping her company. "My family is in   so I'm spending Poila Boishak with my bundles of joy at home. It's been a lazy day so far. I gorged on luchi and aloo-r dum in the morning followed by pulao and mangsho in for lunch. Now I'll have one big bowl of ice cream and sleep," said the actress. So, is it a cheat day, we ask her. "I don't even think about diet on this day. We Bengalis are big foodies and the first day of the year should be spent with good food and loved ones. I have a get-together to attend in the evening and I'm looking forward to it!"
