GURUGRAM: Residents of   have complained that builder   is not running the third transformer even though the occupancy rate has gone up in the township, increasing the power demand.

 According to the residents, the occupancy in the flats has reached around 80% and power demand has increased by over 33% in the past one year. They said last year too, overload let to   and if the third transformer is not switched on, the problems will recur this summer too. The residents said last year they witnessed around half a dozen blackouts.
 
 “Our RWA had to urge Unitech maintenance team to balance the correct load between the two existing transformers to mitigate the situation but nothing happened,” said Sumit, a resident of Nirvana Fresco. 
 
 Nirvana Fresco has 830 apartments across 16 towers, of which around 700 are occupied.
 
 “Currently, Fresco has only two operational transformers of 1,500 kWA,” said Nilesh Tandon, RWA president,  . “Since last year, we have been taking up the issue with Unitech and various government authorities. Two transformers cannot bear the increasing load of the township and therefore making the other transformer operational is necessary. Besides, since past six years, no maintenance work has been carried out on these two transformers.”
 
 The residents said that in the last two years, two more towers – 11 and 16 – were thrown open for residents resulting in an increase in occupancy as well as power consumption.
 
 The residents fear that “inadequate” power infrastructure capacity will pose problems in coming months as residents will turn on air conditioners that will draw more power.
 
 “The maximum load that one 1,500 kWA transformer can take is 1,668 amperes so combined load that the two transformers can take is 3,336 amperes. However, as a standard, not more than 80% of their capacity should be run,” said Rohit, another resident.
 
 When TOI called up Unitech project head of Nirvana Fresco, he refused to comment on the matter.
