NEW DELHI: The housing and urban affairs ministry told Lok Sabha on Wednesday that 708 government bungalows in the Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone (LBZ) are “considered structurally unsafe against earthquake”.

 In response to a written question, minister of state   informed the Lower House that the assessment of unsafe bungalows was done by the   (CPWD). “Razing/ refurbishment/replacement of such bungalows are considered in a phased manner,”   responded in the written reply.
 
 There are about 1,200 bungalows in the LBZ. About 740 bungalows of them of different sizes are owned by the government. These bungalows were built between 1912 and 1930. In 2014, the CPWD had mooted a proposal to rebuild about 480 of these bungalows and a   proposal was prepared. The estimates prepared during UPA indicated requirement of around Rs 3,000 crore for this task.
 
 Though after coming to power, the NDA government had moved a proposal to redevelop the LBZ, it has remained in cold storage. The housing and urban affairs ministry has prepared a draft proposal and had also invited suggestion and objections from the stake holders.
 
 Sources said the decision of development of the LBZ has to be taken by the political leadership. “The plan to rebuild or redevelop the bungalows will be decided only after government takes a decision on the redevelopment of LBZ,” said a source.
