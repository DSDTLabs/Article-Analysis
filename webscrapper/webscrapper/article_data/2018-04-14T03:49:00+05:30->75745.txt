Porvorim: Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte on Thursday suggested that the pulse time of traffic signals on the Panaji-Mapusa and Mapusa-Panaji routes be reduced by three seconds, and that of the Sangolda-Porvorim and B B Borkar-Sangolda signals be brought down by five seconds. He also recommended that the red, amber and green lights be converted to numerical format. 

 The suggestions came after the legislator observed how traffic was moving at the Oâ€™Coqueiro junction in Porvorim following the removal of barricades that were earlier installed there. DySP (Traffic) Dharmesh Angle, who was also present at the inspection, told Khaunte that motorists proceeding towards Defence Colony, Torda and Panaji found it difficult to turn right at the roundabout due to its small diameter. He also said that when the   drops, motorists station their vehicles on the zebra crossing, making it difficult for pedestrians to cross. tnn
