NEW DELHI: Two   contesting for the position of gram   in Sambhal district in UP have been arrested on Saturday for stealing vehicles and committing robberies in the capital. The two, along with an associate, targeted more than a hundred stores with designer clothes to impress the villagers and fulfil the demands of their female partners.

 Police said that the accused were identified as Nem Chander (27), Hem Singh (22) and Chander Prakash (23). All three of them belong to Sambhal, cops said. 
 
 Hem Singh and the kingpin of the operation Nem Chander are brothers. They came to Delhi a few years ago and took up pick-pocketing and petty thefts. Soon they graduated to committing burglaries and lifting vehicles, said Shibesh Singh, DCP (Dwarka).
 
 The three stole motorcycles and sold them in and around Sambhal, police said. One gang member was arrested two weeks ago and several motor cycles were recovered from his possession. Police said that the three would conduct reccee of shops and houses before committing burglaries.
 
 Police said that they have a long list of criminal involvements in and around west Delhi. The kingpin Chander nurtured political ambitions and desired to contest the next election of   pradhan at Sambhal. To gain popular support, he used the money to support folks of his village in kind and financially as well.
 
 Police said that further investigation of the case is in progress and efforts are being made to ascertain their involvements in other cases and to affect more recoveries.
