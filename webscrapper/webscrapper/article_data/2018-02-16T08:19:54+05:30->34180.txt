AMRITSAR: A Hindu pilgrim from Pakistan, who had come to Amritsar as part of a ‘jatha’, left his group and suddenly disappeared on February 12, creating panic among cops in the city and other members of the jatha.

 However, it later turned that the man had met an Indian woman from Vadodara on Facebook and had promised to meet her in Amritsar on Valentine’s Day. The two lovebirds were tracked down in a hotel in Amritsar to the relief of the cops and other jatha members.
 
 The Pakistani man is a resident of Baluchistan province. Pakistanis visiting India are given visas for specific cities and can’t visit any other part of the country. The jatha the man had come with was given a visa to visit only Amritsar.
 
 As soon as the man arrived in Amritsar through the   crossing on February 12, he left his group and was nowhere to be found. Given the tension between the two countries in recent months, this created panic among the rest of jatha members who rushed to the police to track him down.
 
 “One of the man’s relatives had taken him along to a hotel near the  , but the police have found him and he is back with us,” said Mukesh Rana, president of the Shri Guru Seva Welfare Trust, Karachi, who is leading jatha to India. “It was a misunderstanding which has been resolved.”
 
 Deputy commissioner police   told TOI, “The man has joined the jatha for the time being. We are questioning him and trying to get as many details about his disappearance as possible. If we find anything suspicious, we will take appropriate action.”
 
 Rana said that he and the rest of the jatha members had no clue that the man had fallen in love with a Gujarati girl as a result of which they panicked and informed the cops.
