CHARMINAR: The   (AIMMO), on Thursday, demanded the Telangana government fulfil its promise of providing 12% reservation to   in the state, safeguards Waqf properties and takes stern action against land grabbers occupying them. 

 While reminding chief minister,  , about his assurance on reservation, M A  , former member of the AP State Minorities Commission pointed out how nothing has been done, on this front, in last four years.
 
 "Before the formation of Telangana,   had promised that Muslims will get 12% reservation. But all that they have got are hollow words. That is why Muslims are angry with his leadership. If the chief minister fails to keep his promise, he shouldn't expect anything from Muslims in return as well," said Siddiqui.
 
 AIMMO members also rued the land survey carried out by the government wasn't up to the mark, and urged the ruling party to appoint an official as endowment commissioner to protect land belonging to the state Waqf Board.
 
 "Our demand is to protect Waqf land which is spread over more than 70,000 acres. Of this 57,000 acres is reported to have been encroached upon. We want the government to give judicial power to   (STWB) so as that it can reclaim all the encroached land," said the AIMMO chairman, Syed Muqtar Hussain.
