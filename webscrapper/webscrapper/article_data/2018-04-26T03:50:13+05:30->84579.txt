GURUGRAM: A   boy’s joyride in his father’s Alto on Wednesday ended on an unpleasant note.

 The boy was intercepted by   police for driving without licence while the father was fined Rs 1,000. The father also got an earful from the cops and was made to promise that he would never allow his ‘underage’ son to drive the car.
 
 Police said the boy was waiting in the car just outside Kendriya Vidaylya on Old Delhi-Gurugram road in Sector 14 around 1pm when traffic cops intercepted him. The cops, led by ASI Arvind Kumar, were busy managing the traffic flow in front of the school and the car was blocking the road.
 
 As ASI Kumar went to the car, he saw a minor boy sitting on the driving seat. He asked the boy for his licence, which he did not have.
 
 “When enquired about the car, the boy said it belonged to his father. He further said that there was no one at home, so he brought out the car to take his brother and sister home from the school,” said Kumar.
 
 Kumar then called his father, who claimed that he was in office and was not aware that his son had gone to the school in the car. On this, Kumar asked his father to send someone, who has a driving licence, to take his car and son home.
 
 “Two of his neighbours came in an Innova. We issued them a challan of Rs 1,000 in the name of the boy’s father for driving without licence. They paid the fine on the spot. Finally, we handed over the car to one of them. The father of the boy also promised us that he would never give his car to his son before he gets a driving licence,” Kumar added.
 
 Lately, the Gurugram   have been on vigil to check any kind of traffic rule violation on the city roads. Last week, the three youths on a Bullet were arrested for creating ‘silencer blasts’ on Sohna road. Though the three were later released on bail, the police said the arrests were aimed at sending across a message to all road rogues.
