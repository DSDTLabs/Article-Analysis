Filmmaker  , who became a father via   to twins named   and  , said he doesn't want them to grow up on film sets.

  
  
 
 "I am not a big fan of taking my children to a place of work...They should enjoy. I don't want them to grow up on a film set. I don't want them to grow up with that you have to be a part of a film industry only," Karan said.
 
 The filmmaker, 45, said he wants them to make their own decisions when they grow up.
 
 "Let them make their own decisions in life. I will not force an atmosphere on them," he added.
 
 Karan said his life has not changed much after becoming a parent.
 
 "The schedule of life has changed. The mornings start from two beautiful faces and ends with two beautiful faces. How am I balancing it (work and personal life) I have always done six things at one time. So for me I am doing seven things at one time now. It's no different," he said.
 
 But parenthood is a huge responsibility, he said.
 
 "Being a parent is a huge responsibility and I am so happy that im co-parenting with my mother. It's a blessing that she's at home with the babies everyday. It's a beautiful feeling," he added.
 
 He welcomed his twins in March 2017. The daughter Roohi is a rearrangement of his mother's name   and the son has been christened Yash on Karan's late father's name.
