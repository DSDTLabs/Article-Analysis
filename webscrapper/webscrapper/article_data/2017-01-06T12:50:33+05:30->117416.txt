CHANDIGARH: Ending speculation over his candidature for the Punjab assembly elections, Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) president and deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal has announced to contest from his current constituency Jalalabad. He will be facing   (AAP) MP Bhagwant Mann.

 Meanwhile, his father and Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal has also decided to contest the next assembly election from his tradtional seat of Lambi. AAP has announced the candidature of its Delhi legislator Jarnail Singh from Lambi.
 
 SAD secretary Daljit Singh Cheema said on Thursday that the CM would contest from Lambi — a constituency he won in 1997, 2002, 2007 and 2012. Sukhbir will contest from Jalalabad, from where he won the 2009 byelection and then in 2012.
 
 Jarnail, a former journalist, is an MLA from Rajouri Garden. He first hit the headlines when he hurled a shoe at then Union minister P Chidambaram at a press conference in 2009. Congress is yet to announce candidates for the two high- profile constituencies.
 
 SAD has so far declared names of 89 candidates, out of the 94 it’s going to contest. Its alliance partner   is going to fight on the remaining 23 seats of the total 117 in the state. The Opposition Congress has declared 77 candidates and is yet to decide on the remaining 40.
 
 On the other hand, new entrant to Punjab politics AAP has announced candidates for 109 seats.
