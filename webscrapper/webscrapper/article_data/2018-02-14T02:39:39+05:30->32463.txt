NEW DELHI: The   has filed two FIRs to probe alleged   of about 30 acres of prime  , worth hundreds of crore, in south Delhi’s upscale Saket area to private individuals through alleged tampering of records.

 The gram sabha land, under the control of Delhi government in Asola village, was transferred to private individuals in connivance with revenue department officials, CBI claims.
 
 It is alleged that some officials of the revenue department tampered the land records to insert the name of one Mahesh as the land owner (Bhumidar) of these government properties. Mahesh later sold these properties to a woman, Raman Mehra, at prices which were alleged to be just a small fraction of prevailing market rates, CBI said.
 
 After the scam surfaced, an inquiry was ordered by the office of LG Anil Baijal.
 
 “Since, Mahesh is the main beneficiary as he received Rs 1.40 crore from Raman Mehra by selling 10 bighas gram sabha land, he is also responsible for this conspiracy out of the said tampering,” the inquiry report said. The report was cited by Ankita Chakravarty, the then SDM (Saket). 
 
 Mahesh allegedly sold 10 bighas of gram sabha land to Mehra for Rs 1.40 crore, the report said.
