VISAKHAPATNAM: Even as incessant rainfall has led to floods in several areas of the state, it has come as a boon to   district which has registered a rise in the   levels. The average groundwater level in July is 7.15 metres, but this year it has risen to 7.74 metres from the surface during the same period.
