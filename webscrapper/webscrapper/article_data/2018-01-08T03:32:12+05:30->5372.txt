NEW DELHI: Armed with “favourable” legal opinion from   lawyer  , Jamia Millia Islamia students are hopeful of their first union election in 12 years. With Hegde saying that Jamia is “free to hold elections and that, in no way, does it count as any kind of contempt of court”, the students are claiming a big victory.

 To counter the university administration’s opposition to political activities on the campus, several student organisations had formed a joint action committee to work in tandem with the authorities and possibly effect a change of thought. With consensus elusive, the students started a hunger strike in October, prompting the administration to form a five-member committee, which recommended that legal opinion be taken as the matter was sub judice.
 
 The strike was called off after assurances from the varsity administration.
 
 “Going through the case, I found that there is no bar in HC proceedings on conducting elections. There is no such order in the petition that polls should be kept on hold.” Hegde added that Jamia “has the option to file an application for direction, informing HC of its schedule of elections and plans put in place therein,” Hedge said on Sunday.
 
 Calling it a “victory of our struggle”, JAC members warned that if “the administration does not stand by its promise, then we will conduct a more vigorous struggle. The administration cannot run away from its duty, citing legal cases. We expect the VC to be sympathetic towards our demand and allow the union election,” Laraib Ahmed, a member of JAC, said.
 
 Jamia media coordinator Saima Saeed said the university would get the opinion vetted by its own legal expert and have a discussion when the new session commenced.
