 Addressing the media outside the house, Dakha MLA and the Leader of Opposition   along with LIP's Bains brothers accused Congress government of making a last-minute change in Tuesday's schedule on the governor's address.
 
 "The copies of schedule distributed to the members on Friday clearly mentioned that debate on governor's address under vote of thanks to be held at 2 PM on March 28 but the whole schedule was changed in morning today. I am surprised to learn that the government is cancelling moving of motion of thanks on the governor's address and wants no discussion on the same in this session," said Phoolka.
 
 AAP accused Congress of a fearing scrutiny over unconstitutional appointments of 13 OSDs to Punjab's new chief minister   and the ministerial ranks to five of them.
 
 "The Congress and Amarinder fear there will be strong opposition by us on the floor of the house over OSD appointments which is another burden on Punjab's finances. The Congress has murdered the democracy by not assigning even a single minute to the elected representatives to raise the issues of public concern in Vidhan Sabha," said Phoolka.
 
 The AAP walkout triggered a wave of reactions from the Congress benches, with several party leaders following the CM in attacking the principal opposition party .
 
 Local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu said, "Let the time come and we will give them suitable response on everything," Sidhu told the house.
