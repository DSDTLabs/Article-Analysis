 Opening up on how life has changed post motherhood, she said, “I think motherhood is a wonderful feeling. It changes your personality. I think I have become more responsible. And obviously, your world starts revolving around your baby. Even when I am recording songs at the studio or travelling for work, I first think of my baby and what he is up to. My hands are always on my phone to check what Shivaay is doing.”

 Tulsi said that she tries to give maximum time to her baby. “While picking assignments, I am making sure that I don’t get overburdened with work and I can dedicate most of my time to Shivaay. This has completely been my decision. I feel what works for one new mom may not necessarily work for another, so it’s better to find one’s own path,” she said.
