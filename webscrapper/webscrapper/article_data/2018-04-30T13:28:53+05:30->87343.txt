UDHAGAMANDALAM: In a rare occasion, the heritage Nilgiri Library in Ooty saw an author chairing its monthly book club meeting on Saturday. ‘Shifting Sands’, a book of compilation of seven novellas authored by  , was chosen for discussion. Radha, who released her first book at the age of 68, took questions from the audience. According to her, age is no bar to become a writer.

 Shifting Sand was released in July 2017.
 
 Radha, a debutant author, while addressing the book club members of the Nilgiri Library, said, “The book dwells with relationships not only of men and women but among families and friends.”
 
 Born in  , Radha is now settled in Chennai. She has the habit of scribbling her thoughts and ideas. Earlier, she had written, at least, 10 short stories. “When my family and friends asked me to compile the stories for publication, to my dismay, I found the original manuscript missing. It was a big shock to me. This happened when I was in my thirties.”
 
 Ten years ago, Radha who is very passionate about travel and reading, re-started her writings and thus the seven novellas were born. “All the seven stories talk about a shift in life in connection with relationships. One of the stories is about homo-sexual relationships,” she said frankly, adding, “One cannot be judgmental when it comes to relationships. Life should be seen as we see it. The ultimatum of any relationship is happiness”.
 
 When asked why most of the stories were set against the backdrop of Kerala’s culture and tradition, Radha said, “They were not intentional. It happened, maybe I am from Kerala.”
 
 “Shifting Sand is an easy read and it doesn’t convey any message but talks widely about nuances in any relationship,” she said. 
 
 Talking about the characters in her book, Radha said, “I wouldn’t say my characters have been depicted as strong ones, but they are not afraid of to be themselves.”
 
 Presently, Radha is into writing two novels.
