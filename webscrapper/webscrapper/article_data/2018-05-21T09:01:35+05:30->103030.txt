HYDERABAD: Former Union minister   of the Bharatiya Janata Party charged at Telangana chief minister   on Sunday for getting closer to the Congress in the name of his proposed federal front.

 
 “Why TRS leaders would be attending the swearing-inceremony of HD Kumaraswamy in  ? They should tell the people of Telangana. TRS MP   should realise that the scope of forming a stable government by regional parties is less compared to national parties,” Dattatreya told a media conference here.
 
 Lashing out at   Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, the   veteran leader said   had no moral right to criticise BJP’s attempt to form government in Karnataka, it being the single largest party. “How can   who has wooed the YSRC MLAs into the TDP can even talk about BJP,” he said.
 
 Terming the post-poll alliance of Congress and JD (S) as unholy, Dattatreya expressed doubts about the alliance continuing for long.
