 Animal welfare officer Bimlesh Navani said she informed the police on Wednesday and also instructed the dog's handlers to get it medically treated at the Parel animal hospital, BSPCA. Utilizing the services of an ailing animal as a guard dog is considered animal cruelty.

He is just not fit enough to be assigned a guard dog's work at the busy   station," said Navani.
 
 She added that the security firm has assured her that Marshal's treatment will begin soon at BSPCA.
 
 Navani said she has told the security firm to keep her posted about Marshal's health, progress. "If not, I have told them that I will file a police case of animal cruelty against them. They have said they will comply."
 
 Another official of the security company, Force One Dog Security, Vinayak Patil, told TOI: "The dog is now resting and not being assigned security duty. Its medical treatment is on." 
 
 Dr Nilesh Dagli of Bombay Veterinary College, Parel, who examined the dog said he is suffering from eye opacity, but it is not exactly cataract. It seems to be curable with regular treatment."
