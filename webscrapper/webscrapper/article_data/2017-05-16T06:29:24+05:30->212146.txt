NAGPUR: The   is mulling over one-door entry rule to prevent students from illegally occupying its   off   at Law College Square. The rule will ensure entry-exit records, entry to only students with ID cards and sealing of all other access points. 

 On Monday, vice-chancellor SP Kane convened a meeting in this regard. It was attended by warden Prakash Shedmake, engineering section officials and others.
 
 The hostel has been grappling with the problem over the years due to insufficient guards and low height of the compound wall. Most of the blocks of the over five-decade-old structure spread over one acre are in a dilapidated condition. More than two students were found in most rooms. Water pipelines are leaking and corridors are filthy.
 
 On May 15, TOI reported that the   had found that many students are staying illegally in the boys’ hostel. Pro-VC Pramod Yeole had submitted a report to Kane in which he taken up security and sanitation issues at the hostel. 
 
 According to the report, the illegal occupants were students who were denied admission to the hostel, thus highlighting the need for NU to augment the intake capacity of the hostel.
 
 Shedmake said the engineering section has been asked to prepare a plan. When asked if redevelopment of the hostel was discussed, he replied in the negative.
 
 Kane referred queries on the meeting outcome to public relations officer Shyam Dhond. Yeole and Students Welfare director  , who is part of the committee, didn’t answer TOI’s calls.
