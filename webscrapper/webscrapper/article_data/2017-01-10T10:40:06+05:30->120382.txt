GURGAON: Four men were arrested for allegedly kidnapping a head constable and thrashing him in Bhondsi, Gurgaon, on Sunday. Police said the incident was apparently the outcome of a   over a   brokered by the cop. 

 Anand Kumar, a resident of Berka village who is currently posted at IRB Bhondsi, was going to work on Sunday morning when six persons in two cars kidnapped him right in front of his house. They took him to a petrol pump, where he was thrashed inside a room.
 
 In the meantime, Anand’s mother called the police, who promptly tracked his mobile phone location and reached the petrol pump within an hour. The police arrested four persons and seized one of the two cars. Two of the criminals, however, managed to give police the slip. 
 
 Raghubir, Tejpal, Neeraj and Arjun, all residents of Berka village, were produced in a city court while two of their accomplices are still absconding. The four, who have been booked under sections 365 ( ), 323 (causing hurt), 307 (murder attempt) of the IPC, have been sent to judicial custody.
 
 “We are conducting raids and will arrest the absconding duo soon,” said inspector Narender Khatana, SHO, Bhondsi.
