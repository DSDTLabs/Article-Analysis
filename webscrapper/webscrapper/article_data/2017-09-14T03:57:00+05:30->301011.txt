Vasco: Around 70-80 houses that may face demolition on Friday wrote to the state governor and other authorities on Wednesday to halt the demolition as they have filed a civil suit before the civil judge senior division, Vasco. ‘These houses at Baina have been in existence for the last 30-40 years in which about 400 people live,’ states the representation.  The residents have applied for regularization of structures under the Goa Regularization of Unauthorized Construction Ordinance of 2016 before the South Goa collector.  However, when they came to know that their structures were in danger, the matter was taken up before the Mormugao municipal council and all 25 councillors unanimously resolved that the structures should not be demolished until the civil suit is heard. “We are not asking to stop the demolition, but just requesting to halt the demolition till the matter is finalised in the civil court, Vasco,”Congress functionary Sankalp Amonkar told TOI.
