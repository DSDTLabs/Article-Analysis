AHMEDABAD: After  , poppy sellers have approached   against the state government’s complete  .

 A single-judge bench in the HC has already turned down the   filed by the addicts, to quash the government circular issued in 2015 on total prohibition of poppy capsules and sought directions to the authorities to allow to continue the supply of poppy capsules. They have now approached a division bench and their appeal is pending.
 
 Meanwhile, five poppy capsule sellers who held licenses have moved the HC against the government’s ban on poppy capsules. They requested the HC to stay authorities from destroying the stock with them. They have also sought directions to the authority concerned to take a quick decision on their applications for renewal of licenses for poppy sale.
 
 The HC is likely to hear this petition on March 9.
 
 Last year, the HC rejected the argument put forth by poppy addicts that access to poppy capsule was their right. The HC said, “There cannot be a right to consume a particular substance like poppy straw, much less the same can by any stretch be viewed or claimed as fundamental right flowing from Article 21 of the Constitution. The concept of ‘life’ encapsulated under Article 21 signifies healthy, rich and contentful orderly life.”
 
 The high court had further said, “Right to health is recognized as part of Article 21. Consumption of intoxicant or narcotic or psychotropic substance is antithetic to the concept of health…Right of such nature cannot be claimed as fundamental.”
