BENGALURU: This election is unlikely to be a star-spangled affair. With the exception of one or two, most actors looking to take the electoral plunge have either retracted or been denied party tickets.

 
 Actor  's bid for a political debut seems to have fizzled out at the very beginning. He quit the newly launched party   last month owing to differences with party founder Mahesh Gowda. "We heard he has returned to films and wish him the best," said Gowda.
 
 Actor Bhavana Ramanna, who was nursing ambitions to contest from   on a   ticket, made way for senior leader Dr H A Shanmukappa.
 
 Shashi Kumar, who had won from Chitradurga Lok Sabha seat in 1999, wanted to contest from Molakalmuru seat this time, but he too failed to get the party nod.
 
 The BJP reportedly wanted to field Tara, an MLC, from any constituency in Bengaluru, but the actor declined. "I wasn't prepared. I'll campaign for our party," said Tara.
 
 Malavika Avinash is an aspirant for a BJP ticket from Krishnaraja in Mysuru where A Ramadas is a contender. "Fingers crossed, but I still hope to get the ticket," said Malavika.
 
 Jaggesh is said to have been asked by BJP to contest from Yeshwantpur while the comedian wanted a seat in Tumakuru district. The Congress wanted to field MH Ambareesh from Mandya but he is reluctant.
 
 The only actor left in the fray is minister Umashree, who will seek re-election from Terdal in Bagalkot.
 
 Actress Amulya, who joined JD(S) on Tuesday, is likely to campaign for the party as her father-in-law G H Ramachandra is tipped to be the candidate from Rajarajeswari Nagar. She's likely to face off with Darshan, who may campaign for Congress candidate N Muniratna.
 
 BJP's Kumar Bangarappa, who had played hero in several films years ago, is taking on brother Madhu in Sorab.
