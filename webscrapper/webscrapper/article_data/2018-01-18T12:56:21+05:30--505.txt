CHARMINAR:   is making lives of people in   miserable.

 The residents of   area complained that their routine has been affected due to only half an hour’s water supply during the day. Though several complaints were made with the  , officials concerned have not taken any initiative to restore normal supply.
 
 One of the residents, S Kumar told TOI that the situation has worsened with most people at home owing to festival holidays. He said that there is no ample water even for cooking.
 
 “Water crisis in the Mochi colony has become a challenge for residents. We are suffering a lot due to this problem for the past one year. While many complaints have been lodged, no efforts have been made to give us respite from water woes,’’ said Kumar, resident of the same colony.
 
 People living in the locality said supply for half an hour daily was not sufficient. Around 300 houses are deprived from potable water due to apathy of the officials concerned. The residents are forced to buy or fetch water from outside.
 
 “We fetch water from nearby localities due to insufficient supply in the colony. This way, the residents are compelled to wait for water till late in the night. We have expressed our resentment and registered protest against the negligence several times, but it has failed to yield any result,” another resident stated.
 
 Residents have now requested officials to take corrective measures.
