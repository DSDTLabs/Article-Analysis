SHIMLA: The BJP has sought governor Acharya Devvratâ€™s intervention to hold the Shimla Municipal Corporation elections before June 4 in a   to him. The corporation, which was elected in 2012 is nearing the end of its term. The BJP has apprised the governor that delaying the municipal election is against the provisions of the constitution and Municipal Corporation Act.

 A BJP delegation led by former chief minister and leader of opposition   demanded the removal of state election commissioner P Mitra from his post for working against the provisions of the constitution. Dhumal said both the Congress and CPI(M) are not willing to hold the civic body election after seeing the overwhelming rush in the recently held rally of Prime Minister   in Shimla. The Congress is trying to delay the election as it is afraid of losing, he added.
 
 Dhumal alleged that double face of CPI(M) has been exposed as on one side it is demanding revision of electoral rolls and on the other it is protesting against the delay in holding elections.
