NAGPUR: The sudden heatwave has started taking a toll on birds too, especially the young ones that are falling out from their nests.

 In the last one week, over 40 cases of birds collapsing due to heatstroke have been reported by bird rescuers. Though different bird species like house sparrow, spotted owlet, Asian Koel, Laughing Dove, and Black Kites are getting hit due to the rising temperatures, the juveniles of house swift are the worst affected as it is their nesting season.
 
 Founder director of Wild-CER and veterinary expert Dr Bahar  , who is engaged in treating sick and injured birds, said that the   were probably trying to fly out to escape the heat in the nest. “Swifts build their nests using mud and saliva. Their nesting season is usually between February and late March,” he added.
 
 Baviskar said the heatwave was the prime reason for sudden collapsing of flocks of young birds. “Due to the heat, the young birds get uncomfortable in their nests and start flying. As they can’t fly long distances, they end up exhausted and collapse,” he said.
 
 “Urban birds like house sparrow, laughing dove, red-vented bulbul, and robin struggle the most for survival during summers as natural water sources dry up. Hence, we always appeal to the people to keep bird baths in their balconies and gardens,” Baviskar said.
 
 Till now, almost 80% of the birds were released after treatment. “We are getting rescue calls from different areas of the city like Pardi, Central Avenue Road, Shankar Nagar, Ramdaspeth, Seminary Hills Jaitala etc. Instead of bringing the collapsed birds to vets, rescuers should give them immediate first-aid by feeding water. This is more effective,” said Baviskar.
 
 He added the cases of heatstrokes had started coming up early this year. “We started getting calls from March end itself. The cases will increase with the rise in mercury,” Baviskar added.
