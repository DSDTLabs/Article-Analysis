CHANDIGARH: Punjab deputy chief minister and Shiromani Akali Dal president   on Tuesday said the bomb blast at Maur was the result of a nexus between AAP and radical elements.
In a statement issued here, he said, “We have been asking the Election Commission to take note of the manner in which AAP convenor Arvind Kejriwal is consorting with extremist forces. Today's bomb blast proves that our apprehensions were correct and that radical elements have infiltrated into Punjab in league with AAP".
 
 The SAD chief said the manner in which the bomb blast was staged was also a hallmark of blasts done during the days of terrorism. “It has been reported that there were twin ED devices and that the scooter and car used for the attack sported fake number plates and even the numbers of their chasis and engine had been struck off“.
 
 Badal asked the EC to keep a strict watch on radicals who had become active in the state after long. “It would be best to watch the activities of undesirable elements who have entered the state in the name of canvassing for AAP. These people are being funded to foment trouble. If they are not nipped in the bud, there could be more such incidents."
