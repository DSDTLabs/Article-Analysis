AHMEDABAD: Canadian prime minister   said on Monday that there was vast scope to improve   with India which currently stands at an annual USD 8 billion, of which USD 2 billion came from investments in IT services and natural resources. Trudeau was speaking at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, (IIM-A) as part of a discussion on ‘Education and Investment Opportunities’. “We do a USD 2 billion business with the United States every day. There is a lot to be explored to improve trade ties and people-to-people connections with India,” Trudeau said. 

  
  
 On the personal level, Trudeau said that he was a feminist. “It comes with the understanding that empowering women is not just ‘the right thing to do’ or ‘the nice thing to do’ but it is the smart thing to do,” he said. “Today, we are underperforming as communities because we are not giving women the opportunities to contribute to our economy. We are not allowing them to achieve their potential.” While drawing attention to the sexism and discrimination women face in everyday life, Trudeau said: “Any comments about how a man looks isn’t even an eyelash worth of the systemic discrimination women face.” He went on to say: “As a man in business and politics, I had lots of advantages and I didn’t face the discrimination, sexism, superficiality, and judgement that women go through every day.”
 
 On Canada’s relationship with America, Trudeau said that he always emphasizes how he and US president Donald Trump are similar in their approach towards the future. He said that while they differ in their approach to solving problems they are working for the uplift of the middle-class. He said their policies have worked for Canadian and US economies.
