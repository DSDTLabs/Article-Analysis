GUWAHATI: The state government on Monday constituted a one-man inquiry   to investigate the death of one   (42) who was allegedly killed in an   in   on December 28 last year. 

 Narzary's death had led to a huge public outcry in the districts under the Bodoland Territorial Areas District (BTAD), forcing chief minister   to promise a high-level probe.
 
 An official statement from the government said, "The inquiry committee will be headed by Ahmed Hussain, commissioner, lower Assam division and central Assam division and commissioner & secretary of the general administration department. It will submit its report within 30 days."
 
 At the time of the incident, security forces had claimed Narzary was an NDFB (Songbijit) rebel. Following the killing, hundreds of villagers from the Bengtal area had staged a rally alleging foul play. They had claimed Narzary, a father of three, had not been involved with any rebel group. The protesters had shouted slogans against the 'encounter' and had gheraoed the Bengtal police outpost, too.
