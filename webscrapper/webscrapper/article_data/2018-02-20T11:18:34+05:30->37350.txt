The car business magnate   recently shot into space will likely collide with Earth or Venus eventually, scientists say. “It will likely end up colliding with Earth or Venus, but there’s no need to panic since the probability of that happening even within the next million years is very small,” said   of the   in Canada.

 The car, now classified as a near-Earth object, is being tracked by  . 
 
 After running a series of simulations, researchers have determined the probability of it colliding with Earth or Venus over the next one million years to be 6 and 2.5%, respectively. 
 
 While they only ran simulations for the first three million years of its space journey, the most likely outcome for the   is a crash into Earth or Venus in 10 million years or so.
