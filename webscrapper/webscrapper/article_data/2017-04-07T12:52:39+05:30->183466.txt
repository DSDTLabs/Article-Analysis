Over a stage career spanning 27 years, city-based   got to explore and perform the works of several Urdu poets, namely, Mirza Ghalib, Mir Taqi Mir, and Daagh Dehlvi to name some. But somewhere, she felt that the works of women still wait to be heard. “There are some wonderful works by Urdu poetesses, so I thought, why not have an evening dedicated solely to their work,” says Neerja.

 Teaming up with kathak dancer Rujuta Soman and classical singer Gayatri Sapre Dhavale, she will present ‘Seher Hone Tak’, an interesting amalgamation of shayari, music, acting and dance, on April 8, at Shadja, Rutuja Park, Baner, at 6.30 pm.
 
 While finalising pieces for the performance, it was a challenge finding works of poetesses from the 16th and 17th centuries. “We managed to source three poems of   (she wrote under the pseudonym, ‘Makhfi’). Besides this, there are pieces by celebrated poets, like  ,  , Dr Zarina Sani and  , including one by city deputy collector, Monika Singh,” says Neerja.
 
 The evening will be presented in the style of mushaira (a poetic symposium). But, there are no musical instruments; just Rujuta’s ghungroos and an app that will produce the sound of the tanpura to accompany Gayatri as she renders ghazals. “This is to say that we are the instruments, and we will create the mood for the evening,” says Neerja. Rujuta says, “While the concept is novel, it was challenging interpreting and setting the ghazals to dance.” Gayatri adds, “Producing the right sur and emotions becomes all the more exacting when there’s no proper accompaniment.”
 
 The format demands for a very intimate setting, which is why the concert is being held at a bungalow. “The theme ‘Seher Hone Tak’ (till morning comes), likens a woman to a candle that helps you make it through the night. Whatever be her role in life, she will walk beside you, supporting you when you need it most,” says Neerja, signing off.
