Panaji: Erratic rain this season has left many wondering when the showers are likely to intensify. Some days there is active rain with intense showers while on others prolonged breaks call for a humid day. This fluctuation of intense rain and prolonged breaks is affecting the rain pattern in India, said Ramesh Kumar, chief scientist at National Institute of Oceanography, Goa. He was speaking at Museum of Goa (MoG) on Sunday on ‘Weather and Climate of India’. Kumar stated that one of the factors for prolonged breaks this season is due to moisture transfer moving away from the peninsular area of India during the monsoon.  “The temperature has warmed by almost one degree celsius in the past 57 years. This is a substantial increase which has resulted in more moisture coming out in to the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean. This is one of the reasons for the prolonged breaks in monsoon,” he said. Elaborating further he explained that within a monsoon cycle there are several active and break spells. Of 122 days (June 1 to Sept 30) it does not rain every day in the same manner. Some days heavily; this condition is called active monsoon condition. On other days, there is no rainfall on most part of the subcontinent, except Tamil Nadu and the foothills of the Himalayas. Such a condition is called break in monsoon condition. Studies by NIO reveal that this erratic pattern started in the past few decades, and has continued ever since. Kumar further added that the prolonged break is an unfavourable weather condition. We require spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall throughout the season for a stable climate. “The peak monsoon period is from July to August wherein 61% of rainfall occurs. We can hope that the rain showers are continuous during this period so that there is some stability in the pattern,” he added.
