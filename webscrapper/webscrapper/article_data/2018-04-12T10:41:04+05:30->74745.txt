IDUKKI: A   and report on ecologically sensitive areas (ESAs) based on the Kasturirangan report have been submitted to the central government, said   MP  . 

  As per the new report, the total   has been reduced to 8,683 sq.km in the state. Earlier, the   government had appointed a committee led by Oommen V Oommen who studied the Kasturirangan report and submitted recommendations to the government. As per the earlier report, the ESA in the state was 9,993.07 sq.km. But as per the new report, the ESA has been reduced by 1,310 sq. km.
 
  The new report has excluded the Cardamom Hills Reserve (CHR) areas from the ESA list, said Joyce George. A meeting on February 2, 2017, called by the chief minister had decided to exclude farm lands and human living areas from the ESA list.
 
  "Now, most of the villages in Idukki district have been excluded from the ESA list. In the district, only 1,838.18 sq.km forest land has been included in the ESA list. Peermade, Kokkayar and Peruvanthanam villages are totally excluded from the list," said Joyce George.
 
  "We welcome the government decision to reduce ESAs in the state. This will help the farmers living in areas bordering forests. The central government should publish the final notification of the Kasturirangan report at the earliest," said  , general convener, High Range Samrakshana Samiti.
 
  The Kasturirangan report is one of the burning issues in Idukki that has affected the district's life and politics for the last five years and there is another uncertainty over it as the central government is yet to publish its final notification.
 
  It was in 2014 that the HRSS and Idukki diocese organized large protests against the Kasturirangan and Gadgil reports.
