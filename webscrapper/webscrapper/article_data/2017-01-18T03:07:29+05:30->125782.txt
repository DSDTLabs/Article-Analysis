NEW DELHI: In a move intended to make it difficult for   makers to flout price caps soon to be notified by the government, the   has made it mandatory for companies to disclose detailed pricing data and information about their products by January 31.

 As it moves to finalise   mechanism for stents, the   (NPPA) has asked for disclosure of such data to bring in more transparency and clarity in   pricing.
 
 In a notification issued on Tuesday, NPPA has directed all stent manufacturers, marketers and importers to submit detailed pricing data related to maximum retail price (MRP) as well as price charged to distributors, stockists, hospitals and retailers. “Companies will have to update this information regularly,” an official said.
 
 Any company not submitting such information will attract action from the regulator under the Drug Price Control Order, 2013, NPPA said. The move is aimed at curbing profiteering and opening the economics of manufacturing and retailing of stents to public scrutiny.
 
 Apart from monitoring the pricing situation, the data is expected to help NPPA fix the ceiling price. NPPA has recently proposed different formulas that add up to 50% reduction in the MRP of life-saving drug eluting cardiac stents from February. Classifying stents primarily under —drug eluting stents (DES) and bare metal stents (BMS) —NPPA has suggested a series of options to fix prices.
 
 The options include calculations based on fixed percentage margins over average price to distributor, hospital and on production cost and landed cost for imported products. For instance, while most of the proposed DES ceiling prices are in the range of Rs20,000-Rs40,000, the highest of Rs 67,272 has been calculated using the average price of the stent to the hospital topped with a 16% margin. 
 
 The NPPA is expected to take a final decision after its authority meeting next week.
