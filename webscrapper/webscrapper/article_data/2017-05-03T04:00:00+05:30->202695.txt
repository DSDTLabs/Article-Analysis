Vadodara: The bail application of Pratik Singh, who is currently lodged in Vadodara Central Jail in connection with a murder case of 2015, was rejected by sessions court here on Tuesday.

 Singh had murdered Abhimanyu Patel, a resident of Karelibaug, in 2015 in Alkapuri after a brawl. Singh, who is currently in jail, had applied for bail last month.
 
 Opposing Singh’s bail, police filed an affidavit in the court. Cops told the court that there are enough evidences with them which prove Singh’s involvement in the offence. Police also argued that Singh had been carrying a knife with him and therefore there were possibilities of his committing a crime again. 
 
 Public prosecutor submitted that since the trial is on, several important witnesses have to be examined along with complainant Nisarg Sheth. After the arguments, additional district judge H N Trivedi rejected Singh’s bail on the grounds that he was involved in a serious offence.TNN
