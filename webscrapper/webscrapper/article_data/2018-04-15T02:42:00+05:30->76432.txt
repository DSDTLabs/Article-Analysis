Vijayawada: As the capital city’s work is set to start soon, the state government is tiding up the work on the prestigious Kondaveeti Vagu project, to prevent flood threat to Amaravati city. 

 The Kondaveeti Vagu – stream – poses greater flood threat to the capital area, which was raised by the Green Tribunal in the past following which the state took up flood management task to Rs 222 crore of estimation.
 
 The Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited (MEIL) took up the work on January 30, 2017, setting up a six-month deadline to July 29. However, due to procedural issues and handing over the site caused the delay in the completion of the work, which has now been rescheduled to be completed by April 30, this year. According to the proposed plan, the work will delink the rivulet with the Guntur channel that will river water to the Guntur district.
 
 The project is aimed at pumping out the flood water from the stream into the Krishna river to prevent flooding of the capital area. 
 
 “We have almost completed the construction work and the motor pumps are ready for installation which should take about two weeks from now,” a senior representative of MEIL said.
 
 The AP Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) also proposed the construction of 2-3 reservoirs in the Amaravati to divert the flood water from the Kondaveeti Vagu and use them as water bodies for tourism promotion. “The widening and deepening of the existing stream will have a greater inbuilt storage capacity. The reservoirs will take in the additional water and still if there is a flood, the pumping system should drain it into the river,” said Minister for Water Resources, Devineni Umamaheswara Rao, during his inspection at the project site early this week.
