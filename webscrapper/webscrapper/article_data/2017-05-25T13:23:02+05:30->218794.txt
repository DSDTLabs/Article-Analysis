AHMEDABAD: An eight-year-old girl on Wednesday was able to   after seven years as a   at   successfully performing a rare operation called ‘gastric pull up with esophageal reconstruction’. According to the doctors, a gastric pull-up involves bringing up the stomach from the abdomen into the chest area, and attaching it to the remaining portion of the esophagus (food-pipe).

 The girl, called Neha Ramprakash, who belongs to Mau district of Uttar Pradesh, had mistakenly consumed acid when she was just 1.5 years old. Since then, she was being provided food through a pipe which was inserted in her intestine for over seven years. Her parents, who are daily wagers in UP, had tried various hospitals in Uttar Pradesh and also in Gujarat to find remedy for their daughter, but no hope was seen at all.
 
 Earlier this month, Neha’s family reached the gastrosurgery department at VS hospital for treatment. Doctors at the hospital found that her internal organs had been damaged by the acid consumed. So they decided to make a pipe which attaches the food-pipe to gut so that the girl can swallow food in future.
