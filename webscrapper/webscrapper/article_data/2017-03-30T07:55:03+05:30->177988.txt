These ratings are given to distribution companies by rating agencies engaged by   each year. As many as 40 utilities are assessed by the   every year. 

 Officials say these ratings are important for  . Poor ratings hurt the chances of raising adequate and cheap funds from both government and private investors and also in the form of loans sought banks and other financial institutions. 
 
 In the past two Integrated Ratings for State Power Distribution Utilities, the agencies said the key concerns for both Telangana Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSPDCL) and the Northern Discom (TNPDCL) was absence of tariff proposals as well as delays in filing of the ARR. In addition, delays in finalization of audited accounts and other issues are also hurting the ratings of the two power distribution companies. As many as 40 utilities are assessed by the Ministry of Power every year.
 
 In 2016, TSDCL achieved an 'A' rating by improving its performance over 2015, the year for which it received a 'B+', considered a moderate rating. On the other hand, NPDCL has stuck with a B+ rating for the past two consecutive years. The ratings of both the power distribution companies are likely to dip this year due to high power purchase costs and non-filing of ARR with the TSERC within stipulated time limit.
 
 The state discoms have to file their ARR in November every year, i.e., 120 days before the new financial year begins in the subsequent year with TSERC along with their tariff proposals. The Commission then completes procedures that include receiving of objections and suggestions over the proposals as well as conducting public hearings before issuing its orders before March 23.
