NAGPUR: The   has extended the deadline for citizens’   till February 28. Earlier, the deadline for the feedback was February 12. Confirming the news, a senior officer from the NMC said that citizens’ feedback constitutes 30 % marks of the survey. 

 Though the urban development ministry released a list of 10 cities where it is getting good feedback and they include Visakhapatnam, Gwalior, Indore, Mysore, GHMC, Warangal, Jabalpur, Bhopal, Ranchi and Chandigarh, Nagpur failed to find a place. Even TOI recently carried a report about citizens’ poor response to ‘Swachhata MOUD’, an app launched in December through which they can get their problems related to door-to-door garbage collection, sweeping of roads/streets and unhygienic public toilets, addressed.
