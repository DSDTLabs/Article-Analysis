Coimbatore: To mark the  , a group of students from the   in   conducted ‘Elephants are Missing’, a skit, at the   at   on Saturday. 

 As many as 36 students from the school participated in the performance organised by environmental NGO Osai. The children began with a chorus on elephant population —“There were 10lakh of them 40years ago, but now, only 36,000 remain.”
 
 The students recalled the recent events of human animal conflict in Coimbatore. They re-enacted a popular debate programme on a famous Tamil television channel, but with a difference. It had animals explaining the distress and difficulties they face because of human intervention in forests. An ‘elephant’ said, “In Coimbatore alone, nearly 95% of elephant paths for fodder have been destroyed for development. What have come up there? Colleges!" 
 
 The ‘elephant’ went on to say, “What do you expect us to do? Go and study in those colleges?” The elephant, portrayed by a lean girl, added, “The lack of food has resulted in a bulky elephant like me become a lean animal!”
 
 Another character, who caught the attention of the audience, was that of a popular Tamil rapper, who spoke for the animals.
 
 The half-an-hour play demanded humans look at animals’ problems from their point of view. The skit was accompanied by a choir of six, including a boy playing mridangam.
