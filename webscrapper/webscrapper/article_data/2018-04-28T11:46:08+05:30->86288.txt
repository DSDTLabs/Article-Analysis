LUCKNOW: The state government is aiming to construct around 1,000 hospitals in the state in public private partnership mode to provide good healthcare facilities to people.

 
 Health minister Sidharth Nath   said that leading consulting firm Ernst&Young has been asked to prepare details of the project, an extension of central government’s Ayushman Bharat scheme.
 
 “We have almost identified two community health centres in each district. Their land, about 3 acres each, will be given on a long-term lease to private company which will construct a 100-bed hospital, along with an operation theatre and diagnostic centre. The government will reimburse them for   while the   will cover the in-patient department,” Singh said.
 
 “I have already held discussions with some wellknown hospitals in Delhi and in south India and am expecting the project to take off by November this year,” he added. The minister said that he will move a proposal in the cabinet to set a basic minimum module (BMM) for filling posts of doctors in district hospitals. “There is a rule for the same at present which is not being followed. Transfers of doctors are taking place erratically. Once the cabinet clears BMM, it will become mandatory for establishment of certain posts in all hospitals. For example, there will be posts for ENT, paediatrician, gynaecologist, orthopaedic, etc. Unless all these posts are filled, no arbitrary transfers from this hospital will be permitted,” he said.
 
 Singh added that in case there is a shortfall of doctors, posts will be filled on contract basis. “We will issue a tender to hire doctors on contract.” he said.
