MUMBAI: The   put the 2018-19 BEST budget on hold on Thursday as the cash-strapped undertaking showed a deficit of Rs 377 crore while it is mandatory to show a surplus of at least Rs 1 lakh.

 Joining hands, Shiv Sena and BJP corporators asked the BEST undertaking to wait till the  , saying a Rs 377 crore grant could be allocated in the civic budget through an amendment.
 
 BEST officials said the deficit can be balanced with the grant from BMC, but the civic body refused to give the money when the budget was tabled on Thursday. But BMC officials said there was no provision made to sanction the grant. 
 
 A BMC official said this request for grant was “uncalled for” and against the law. “The BEST cannot presume that BMC will give a grant. The losses cannot be compensated with a BMC grant when the same is not approved by the corporation in its budget,” the official said.
 
 However, BJP group leader Manoj Kotak said: “We will support the Sena if they move a proposal for an amendment in the civic budget to get a sanction for Rs 377 crore to offset the losses, and get the budget cleared.” 
 
 Sources said that the budget could get a clearance from the House at the time the civic budget is presented.
 
 Leader of the opposition, Ravi Raja of the Congress, said he was opposed to the budget as it involved a fare hike for commuters. BEST had proposed a hike of Rs 1-Rs 12 in bus fares. The proposal has also been put on hold. 
 
 The budget paves the way for reforms/turnaround measures to generate more revenue for the undertaking.
