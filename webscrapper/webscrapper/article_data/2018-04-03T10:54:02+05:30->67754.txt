AHMEDABAD:   and Gujarat Congress leader   has been appointed the All India Congress Committee Bihar in-charge. Gohil replaces Dr C P Joshi.

  Gohil was earlier considered a frontrunner for a Rajya Sabha seat from the state. He returned to centre-stage with a bang, was back with a bang in the party after ensuring Ahmed Patelâ€™s victory in the Rajya Sabha elections when it seemed that he would be defeated. 
 
 In the 2017 elections, Gohil changed his constituency from Abdasa to Mandvi, where he faced BJP candidate Virendrasinh Jadeja. He failed to end the 10-year saffron rule in Mandvi and lost by 9,046 votes.
