ALLAHABAD: The   (UPPSC) is likely to postpone the   (mains)-2017 examination for second time after a recent Allahabad high court order called for re-evaluation of answer sheets of the preliminary stage of exams. The PCS (mains) examination was scheduled to be held on May 17.

 The commission has already postponed the examination twice when a   probe was ordered into the examinations, after discrepancies were reported in the UPPSC examinations conducted during the Akhilesh Yadav-led state government during 2012-17.
 
 The aspiring deputy collectors appearing in the examination, officially known as ‘Combined State Upper Subordinate Services’, have to undergo three selection stages—prelims, mains and interviews. On March 30, the high court had directed the UPPSC to re-examine answer sheets of the preliminary stage of exams while hearing a bunch of petitions filed over incorrect questions asked in the paper. The court had said that only those aspirants would be allowed to appear in the PCS mains examination who qualify the re-evaluation. Secretary of   said, “The re-evaluation and the declaration of results will take time so the examinations could be deferred.”
