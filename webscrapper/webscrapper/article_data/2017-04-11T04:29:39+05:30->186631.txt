BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh seems to be slowly but surely inching towards prohibition, and the confirmation comes from none other than the state’s chief minister  .

 Speaking at a   rally in Narsinghpur late Sunday night, the CM said the government is moving towards (establishing) a liquorfree state “in a phased manner”. 
 
 Chouhan said at the river conservation rally, some 230km east of  , “Alcohol prohibition will be implemented in the entire state by closing all liquor shops in a phased manner.” 
 
 It was at one such Narmada event in January that the CM had announced a ban on liquor shops within 5km of the Narmada banks, followed by directives to liquor shops to keep records of regular customers. 
 
 Since then, there has been a string of protests by women against liquor shops in several parts of the state.
 
 Taking cue from the CM’s statement, and the liquor protests across MP, state finance and commercial tax minister   said that if “people are ready to quit alcohol, the government is ready to impose total prohibition”.
 
 “We want the public to take the initiative against alcohol abuse. Also, to discourage drinking the government will spend Rs 400 crore this fiscal on creating awareness against liquor,” Malaiya told TOI, adding that the government will encourage people to spend money on “good education and milk instead”.
 
 “The government’s initiatives began with the shifting of 65 liquor shops across the banks of Narmada, followed a ban on liquor shops near residential areas, schools, colleges and religious places,” said Malaiya. The anti-liquor build-up has run parallel with the cleansing theme of the Narmada Yatra, which ends on May 11.
