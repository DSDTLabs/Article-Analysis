NEW DELHI: The   rejected on Monday a plea moved by   member and UP minister  , a suspect in a case of alleged gang rape, for a stay on his arrest. An FIR was lodged against Prajapati, who contested a high-profile election in  , following a direction from the SC. He has been missing since the completion of polling.

 While regretting that the case against Prajapati was being given “political colours”, a bench of Justice A K Sikri and Justice Ashok Bhushan said the court’s order was confined to the registration of an FIR, and did not mention anything about arrest.
 
 With assembly elections under way in UP, the court’s order has been referred to by BJP members as evidence of SP bosses flouting the law with impunity. Senior advocate Amarendra Saran and counsel Sanchit Guru, appearing for Prajapati, contended that there was an impression that the SC was monitoring the probe and the accused would never get any relief from other courts.
 
 Justice Sikri seemed upset and clarified that the court was not monitoring the probe. “It is very unfortunate that political colours are being given to the order. State counsel was present on that day but he was not able to answer our questions and we passed the order,” he said.
