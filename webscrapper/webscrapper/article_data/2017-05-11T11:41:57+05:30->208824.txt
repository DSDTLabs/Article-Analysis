HYDERABAD: The   (RBI) recently issued a clarification to banks that scribbled notes should be accepted, but there seems to be a few takers for it in the city.If you have scribbled notes you might find it difficult to make payment using them or exchange in the market. Many shopkeepers across the city refuse to accept the notes blaming it on the banks.

 It is a common practice among shopkeepers to bundle notes and scribble down the number for easy maintenance of accounts. “Banks generally accept notes with pencil markings. They do not accept notes with ink markings,“ said KV  , owner of a stationery shop in  . Another shop owner in   said that he paid his employees this month in cash, but they had returned ` 2,000 notes after other shop owners refused to take them.
 
 “Now I also stopped taking such notes“ he said.Sources said banks generally admit accepting scribbled notes from their own customers. This is more common with small banks.We know that such notes are not a problem,“ said a bank employee. The RBI sent circulars to banks they can accept scribbled notes. Refusal to accept such notes attracts fine up to `10,000. A general manager of a public sector bank said that banks are bound to accept scribbled or coloured notes. But lower levels staff at the counters refrain from taking them.
 
 “They also have a reason. Branches need some time to get such notes exchanged from the currency chest. They are also pulled up for sending too many such notes,“ he said.
 
 The apex bank has also advised the general public against writing on notes.“Bankers can never say no to scribbled notes. They should accept even fake notes and confiscate them as per our policy,“ a Reserve Bank of India official said.
