 Hyderabad: In a shocking incident, a 25-year-old   killed her husband with the help of her paramour in Pulimamidi village near Maheshwaram on Friday night. However, his body was found in a sump on Saturday. 
 
 The victim was identified as A Srinivas (26), a farmer. According to Kandukur police inspector K V Vijay Kumar, the victim was throttled, bludgeoned with a stone and his body was dumped in a water sump near his residence. 
 
 “The victim’s wife A Geeta (25) was having an affair with another person, M Srinivas (25), a cable TV operator. They had eloped hoping to get married three months ago. After Srinivas learnt of their affair, he reprimanded her and brought her back. Since then, she had been staying with him,” he told STOI. 
 
 However, the two lovers were in contact for the last two months, police said.
 
 “On Friday, she reportedly told her paramour that her husband was reprimanding her for their affair. So, both Geeta and her   conspired to kill Srinivas. They waited at home and when her husband returned, they pounced on him and killed him, police said 
 
 “We received a complaint from a local about foul smell emanating from the sump. When we opened it, we found a body. We are waiting for the post-mortem report to ascertain how he died,” he added.
