NEW DELHI: Crime is common in the sprawling   living close to   in central Delhi. Almost everyone residing in the  , where a three-year-old girl was raped by a 22-year-old youth, are   employed as labourers in the factories nearby.

 “Daily wagers come and live here for a short while and then move on,” said a police officer. “So there is no bonding among the residents that could have made the neighbourhood more heterogeneous. Also, the regular appearance of new people in the localities makes it difficult to keep tabs on anyone.”
 
 Amid this collection of disparate people, many children wander from home looking for spots where they can relieve themselves, putting themselves at risk of predators. They also make the most of whatever space is available on the dingy lanes because there are no parks or playgrounds around. It was from outside her house that Vijay picked up his victim on Wednesday morning. “We never stop our children from playing on the roads because such a crime has never occurred in this area,” confided a neighbour of the child survivor.
 
 However, now that a monstrous crime had taken place, the local residents agree that it might recur anytime. Land owners and long-time residents vouch for each other and share a strong sense of belonging, but look at the migrants with suspicion and distrust. The accused in Wednesday’s crime, Vijay, was one such. He had moved into the colony only a year ago. After being employed by a local contractor, he had taken to drinking. “We never wanted him near us when he was drunk,” said a neighbour of the girl’s family.
