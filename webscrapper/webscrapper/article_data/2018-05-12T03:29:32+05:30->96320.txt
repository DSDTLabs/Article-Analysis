MUMBAI: Following the escape of a 19-year-old undertrial from the high-security   last week, the prison authorities have suspended five jail personnel for negligence. The undertrial,  , a   resident, had been arrested for stealing a cellphone. 

 A jail source said five jail personnel were found guilty of negligence. "They are jailor  , head constable  , constables Rajanendra Magar, Dipak Tumade and Suresh Shirsath," said the source.
 
 The undertrial had been arrested on May 2 by the railway police at Bandra and was sent to prison a day later. Jail officials said that from the sequence of events, it seems as if Shaikh had done a recce on May 4 to plan his escape. "A guest house is being constructed on the second floor of the administrative building. Shaikh crossed his barrack premises, discreetly climbed the bamboos to reach the second floor. A guard was on the second-floor, but he was unaware of this man's movement," said the source, adding that Shaikh walked out between noon and 1 pm.
 
 Jail authorities learnt of the escape while taking a roll call at 5 pm.
