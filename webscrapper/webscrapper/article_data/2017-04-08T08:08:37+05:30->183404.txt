PUNE: The   have registered an   about the sudden disappearance of   from a   on  . 

 The FIR was registered on Thursday at the behest of Mehar Mathrani, welfare officer of the animal welfare board of India (AWBI), after the board received an emailed complaint from a woman resident of the society — May Fair Eleganza, Phase II.
 
 The woman had alleged that the cats were taken away by a “cat catcher” in a vehicle on January 7, 2017 as per the orders of another person staying in the same society. Following the complaint, AWBI representatives had inspected the site and concluded in its preliminary probe that “the cats may have been killed by the cat catcher”. 
 
 When contacted, Mathrani said, “Citizens should be aware of the laws governing urban community animals. No individual is permitted under the law to interfere in the management of street animals.”
 
 She said we suspect that the alleged cat catchers could be from a specific tribe known for catching cats for their meat. “They are also believed to sell the cat meat, which is then used for meat adulteration in the markets, Mathrani said.
 
 She said investigations have revealed that the cat catcher had entered his name in the visitors’ register. 
 
 “We have got the registration number of the autorickshaw used for transporting the cats,” Mathrani said.
 
 Sub inspector Ganesh Kulal from the Kondhwa police station on Friday said, “An inquiry has revealed that the main accused had caught cats by making use of nets, hands and bait. The cats were packed in a gunny bag and transported in an autorickshaw.”
 
 “We are in the process of analysing CCTV footage of the society for collecting more evidence against the accused,” Kulal added.
