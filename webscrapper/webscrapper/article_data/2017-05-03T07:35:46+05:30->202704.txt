AHMEDABAD: In its attempt to admit all 81,000 candidates under  , who had cleared scrutiny, the   overshot its initial target of admitting 60,000 students, and is now hard put to arrange   for all. Parents were informed of the status of admissions on Monday.

 The state education department failed to give many students admissions in schools of their choice, or within 6 km of their residences. Approximately, 66,000 students have been given admissions, while 15,000 are waiting for their turn, which will come after reallocation applications are over. The current arrangement is temporary, said a state government official.
 
 “Around 56,000 students got admissions according to their choice while approximately 10,000 students got admissions which may not match their preferences,” said a state government official. “In wake of this, we have asked applicants to submit application for reallocation at the nearest help centre,” he added.
 
 Applications seeking change of school or reallocation will have to be submitted by May 10. After review, final allocation of admissions will be done on May 15, and the remaining admissions will be completed, said a government official.
 
 All admissions this time were done online and not in district centres as in previous years. The government had taken applications for admissions under RTE Act from January till the end of February. Out of 1.25 lakh total applications, 81,000 had been found valid. To handle the rush, the state education department sought approval of the government to admit all valid candidates instead of the 60,000 admissions initially planned.
