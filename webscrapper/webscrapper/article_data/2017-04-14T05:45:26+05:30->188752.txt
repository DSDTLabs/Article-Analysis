CHENNAI:   of Tamil Nadu and   has given an   in   that it would neither call for   nor call upon lawyers to indulge in any agitation against the law commission recommendations favour sweeping reforms in bar council and conduct rules for lawyers.

 The undertaking has come despite the Bar Council of India’s (BCI) April 10 letter calling upon its state units and lawyers across the country to burn law commission report copies, to take out rally, to launch signature campaign and also to gherao the Parliament and the law commission premises.
 
 It was given by the Bar council counsel to the first bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar, which was hearing a PIL filed by advocate K Muthuramalingam opposing any such boycott call by the statutory bar council. Muthuramalingam was suspended by Bar council in November 2015 in connection with lawyers’ fracas with the CISF personnel on security duty at Madras high court.
 
 “Pothiraj, counsel appearing for the state Bar council, submitted on instruction that the bar council will not call upon the advocates to abstain from courts nor indulge in any agitation or disrupt any activities in courts in the state,” the bench said, adding: “In view of this undertaking, we do not think it is necessary to pass any order restraining the bar council from holding any meeting.”
 
 Earlier, during arguments, the bench wondered as to how a statutory body could call for such forms of agitation. It also sought to whether the state Bar council campus was located inside Madras high court premises or outside. After ascertaining that it was very much part of the high court campus, the bench said such agitation would then be impermissible.
