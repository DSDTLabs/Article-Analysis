KOLKATA: They strut around the premises in combat fatigues that bear the words   with the insignia of the crossed swords. Some even have their trousers tucked into boots in true   style. What gives them away is the way they slouch while sitting and their unmilitary gait. They are private security guards hired by the Indian   (IBG) in Howrah’s Shibpur. 

 After receiving reports, officers from the Army’s   visited the garden on Sunday and now plan to take up the issue at the appropriate level. “They were slouching in chairs in the most undisciplined manner. On being asked why they are wearing uniforms that are meant for security forces, they were arrogant and rude. 
 
  
  
 In fact, they were unhelpful and rude to all visitors. We were not in uniform and could make out that some visitors were mistaking them for real soldiers. This is not only a crime but such activity adversely impacts the goodwill of the armed forces. We plan to take this up with the authorities,” a senior Army officer who visited IBG said. Another officer wondered how security guards hired by a government institution could violate norms in this manner. IBG is under the  , an organization under the ministry of environment, forest and climate change. 
 
 Army uniforms can’t be worn by the guards even if they are ex-servicemen, he said. “There are security concerns as well. Over the last few years, we have had terrorists entering military installations dressed as soldiers. 
 
 The armed forces has warned citizens against wearing uniforms that they are not entitled to,” he said. “We have no intention of insulting anybody. The Army can come to us and we shall sort out any issue they may have. In fact, we have already instructed our security guards not to misbehave with visitors,” said M U Sharief, director, IBG.
