PUNE: Blatant disregard for safety or rules had claimed the life of a 10-year-old last Wednesday. The   has shifted the focus onto the proliferation of   built dangerously close to high-tension (HT) wires. 

 It was in one such illegal construction that 10-year-old Akash Prajapati lived with his family. They rent one of the 30 one-room accommodations in a four-storeyed building constructed very close to overhead HT wires, in the Padwalnagar area of Thergaon 
 
 On January 25, Akash was flying a kite just outside his house when it got tangled up in a 132 KV extra high-voltage (EHV) line, mere feet overhead. When he was trying to retrieve it, there was a blast in which he sustained severe burns. He succumbed to those injuries. Akash’s elder brother Pavan and neighbours, Aryan and Abhinandan Pande, also sustained burn injuries in the mishap. 
 
 A private English medium school, a single-storied structure with a roof made of tin sheets, is also located below this 14-metre EHV line which starts from Bijlinagar and goes to NCL Ganeshkhind through Rahatni. Hundreds of houses are built very close to, or below, the EHF/ HT lines passing through the city, especially in areas like Bijlinagar, Bhosari, Pimpri, Thergaon, Rahatni and Dapodi. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Vikas Bhumbe, a social worker from the Balajinagar slum in Bhosari said, “Around 12,000 people live in such houses. A mishap is just waiting to happen should anyone go close to these lines. These houses have mushroomed due to the negligence of the civic body and the transmission company.”
