NEW DELHI: The 2017 edition of the   (IPL) was shambolic for Royal Challengers Bangalore, and a last place finish on the points table left them with plenty to introspect on. Having retained  , AB de Villiers and young talent Sarfaraz Khan before the   player auction earlier this year, the owners spent Rs 48.85 crore on purchasing 21 players for the 11th season of the league starting April 7. 

 
 
 
 
 
 How will they fare? Here’s a rundown of RCB ahead of their opening game against Kolkata Knight Riders on April 8. 
 
 
 : Virat Kohli
 
 After missing the recent Nidahas Trophy in Bangladesh, Kohli enters   fresh and raring to go. First on his agenda will be to move RCB up the rankings and put behind them a dismal last season, and if he continues to bat the way he has over the last year it will spell plenty of trouble for opposing bowlers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 : Daniel Vettori 
 
 The former New Zealand captain and left-arm spinner has worked at various levels in the IPL, Big Bash League, Bangladesh Premier League and with Middlesex in English county cricket.

 : The batting will be reliant on Kohli, de Villiers, McCullum and de Kock at various stages of the tournament, and thus getting maximum out of regular Indian talent such as Mandeep Singh, Manan Vohra, Parthiv Patel and Pawan Negi can only add to RCB’s fortunes. Yuzvendra Chahal’s presence means a steady supply of wickets - he is ranked No 2 in T20Is - and the addition of Washington Sundar, who was Player of the Series in the Nidahas Trophy win, gives RCB a very fine spin attack. As always there will be focus on how the pace bowlers fare, which puts Chris Woakes, Umesh Yadav, Corey Anderson, Navdeep Saini and Kulwant Khejroliya under the microscope. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 : 1 Brendon McCullum, 2 Quinton de Kock (wk), 3 Virat Kohli (capt), 4 AB de Villiers, 5 Sarfaraz Khan, 6 Washington Sundar, 7 Pawan Negi, 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Umesh Yadav, 10 Navdeep Saini, 11 Yuzvendra Chahal
 
 
 : 2017 - eighth place; 2016 - runners-up; 2015 - third place; 2014 - seventh place; 2013 - fifth place; 2012 - fifth place; 2011 - runners-up; 2010 - third place; 2009 - runners-up; 2008 - seventh place. 
 
 : If the batting clicks to its potential - imagine what McCullum, de Kock, Kohli and de Villiers can do - and the pace bowlers fire collectively, the pressure will be eased on the formidable pair of Chahal and Sundar. It is the bowling that will decide where they end up on the points table, and not having serious domestic backup for Umesh could be pivotal. RCB need their bowling to last the distance, otherwise the knockouts are a tough shot. 
 
 
 : April 8 v KKR (away); April 13 v KXIP (home); April 15 v RR (home); April 17 v MI (away); April 21 v DD (away); April 25 v CSK (home); April 29 v KKR (home); May 1 v MI (home); May 5 v CSK (away); May 7 v SRH (away); May 12 v DD (home); May 14 v KXIP (away); May 17 v SRH (home); May 19 v RR (away).
