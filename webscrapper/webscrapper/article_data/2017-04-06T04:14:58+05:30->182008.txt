MUMBAI:   offering   courses in   in the state will undergo inspection—probably for the first time. After repeated complaints from students about poor infrastructure and shortage of faculty, the state’s   (DoA) has decided to inspect all colleges in the next three months. Colleges falling short of the minimum criteria will be issued show-cause notices and told to comply with the norms within a stipulated period.

 DoA director Rajiv Mishra said, “We are not sure when these colleges were inspected last. After a harassment complaint from students in a Washind college, we decided to inspect all colleges in the state. A panel will be set up for the sa-me. While engineering colleg-es are inspected by technical education authorities and degree colleges in arts by affiliati-ng varsities, diploma colleges for arts were not scrutinized.”
 
 Santosh Gangurde, the students’ activist who took up the matter with the directorate, said many irregularities go undetected in these colleges. “The authorities have assured that no extra fees will be charged from students. They also said a grievance box will be installed in three regional offices in Mumbai, Aurangabad and Nagpur for students.”
