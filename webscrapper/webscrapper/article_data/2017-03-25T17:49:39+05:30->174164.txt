 NAGPUR: The Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve’s (NNTR) action against   from   was met with retaliation by the accused, who set the forest and bicycles of   on afire.
 
 According to assistant conservator of forest Pradeep Patil, the special tiger protection force jawans caught nine intruders from   on the outskirts of Navegaon on March 20.
 
 The accused fell 51 green bamboos inside the core area of the park for commercial use. On March 21, they were remanded in 5-day forest custody (FCR). On Friday, the court sent them to magisterial custody (MCR) till April 4.
 
 However, to protest NNTR action, supporters of the accused from the village set afire a makeshift protection hut of NNTR. They also set on fire some bicycles of the field staff. At least 8-10 hectares of forest was burned in the fire.
 
 This must be a regular practice and the accused must have gone without action earlier. However, with STPF presence, things seems to be changing on the protection front.
 
 “When caught outside the park, it is easy for the villagers to go without action under the pretext that bamboos were brought from agricultural field. We laid a trap and caught the accused early in the morning,” said Patil.
