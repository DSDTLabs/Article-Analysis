NEW DELHI: For many visitors, 24-year-old Priya is the centre of attraction at Delhi  . But as you walk past her enclosure, she looks the other way, waiting as she is for her special meal. Priya is Delhi zoo’s   big cat, already well past the average time a royal Bengal   survives in captivity. 

 Her teeth are no longer sharp enough to chew the meat she once loved to feast upon. Instead, she is served a special chicken and mutton soup every afternoon. As she nears her 25th year in the zoo, officials say they will soon place boards around the enclosure detailing her life story to attract visitors. “She has outlived most tigers in the country. We have had to change her diet and reduce her time out in the open enclosure with age to ensure she stays fit and healthy. The red meat she used to be fed earlier has been replaced with a special chicken and mutton soup,” Renu Singh, Delhi zoo director, told TOI. 
 
 While white tiger remains the most popular among visitors, Singh said they now wanted to woo people with information about Priya. “We are dedicating boards just for the animal so that people get to know more about her and remember her by name.”
 
 While the next   at the zoo is Rani, a royal Bengal tiger aged 18, there are two others — Vijay and Kalpana, both 10. The oldest male royal Bengal tiger, meanwhile, at the zoo is Bittu (10). Officials said while the average age for a tiger in the wild was 12, it could range from 16-20 years for those in captivity. The oldest a tiger is known to have lived is 26 years — in Australia.
 
 Officials said Priya had recently taken ill and was incarcerated at in the zoo hospital before being shifted back to her enclosure. “In the light of the heat, we have reduced the time she spends in the open. We check on her regularly. As temperatures rise further, we will use coolers to protect her,” a senior zoo official said.
