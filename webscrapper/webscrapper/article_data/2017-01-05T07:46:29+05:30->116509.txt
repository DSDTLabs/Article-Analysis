CHENNAI: Men and women on wheelchairs will take to the ramp as models for adaptive clothing for a city-based designer at the `Trios Fashion Show 2017' on Sunday for a fundraiser. Having made clothes for her husband and aunt who are both   users, Shalini  , an alumni of NIFT, is presenting Indo-western party wear for people with different disabilities.

 Visakan has recently designed a one-piece sari with pleats and blouse that can be worn as a   for her aunt. “She could never go to temples because she could only wear nighties. So I designed it in one piece so that she could be comfortable without having to wear a separate skirt inside,“ says Visakan. “Designer wear in adapti ve clothing is very rare. Some women use diapers and I've given extra crotch length for their clothes. For those who lack motor skills, I have used magnetic buttons and Velcro,“ she says.
 
 The party wear for the physically challenged has been designed in such a manner that they can wear it independently . Students and working professionals from   will model for the show.
