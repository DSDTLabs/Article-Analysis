BENGALURU: A woman, 44, who was being harassed by a stalker demanding sex—he even offered her Rs 2 lakh for it—laid a trap and handed him over to police with the help of her relatives. The man is now cooling his heels in Central Prison( ).

 
 Ramanna, 35, a resident of BK Nagar in Yeshwantpur, and an accountant at   yard, had been stalking the woman for the past few months. “She didn’t even know that he had taken a liking to her,” police said.
 
 Having collected her number a few weeks ago, Ramanna called her on April 30. “He started telling her how beautiful she was and how much he liked her. The woman did not encourage him and disconnected the call,” police said.
 
 On the same day, he called her again and asked her to have sex with him. When the woman warned him, he offered money. 
 
 “He had offered to pay her Rs 2 lakh if she agreed to have sex with him,” police said, adding that he had not revealed his identity during the calls. 
 
 The woman, suspecting that the man may continue to harass her, pretended to be interested when he called again. She told him that she was willing to meet him if he paid Rs 2 lakh and asked him where to come. 
 
 A thrilled Ramanna invited her to a school in BK Nagar at 2pm on May 1. The woman, who had informed her relatives about the stalker, told them to hide around the school.
 
 “Ramanna arrived at the spot and found the woman standing alone. As he walked closer she recognised him, as he lived on the same street as hers but didn’t suspect that he was her stalker. However, he introduced himself and said it was him who called her,” police said.
 
 Soon after his identity was known, the woman slapped him twice, following which her relatives gathered around and thrashed him. They then took him to   police station. 
 
 A case under IPC sections 354 (sexual harassment) and 509 (gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of woman) was filed. Ramanna is in judicial custody now.
