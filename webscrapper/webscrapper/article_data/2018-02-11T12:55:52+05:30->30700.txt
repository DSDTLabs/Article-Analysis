KANNUR: Minister for cooperation,  , said that there is no need to be afraid of the operations of the Kerala Co-operative Bank (KCB). As it will actually strengthen the cooperative banks and more investment will flow.

 He was responding to the concerns raised by leader of the Opposition,  , who called for wider public discussions to clear the concerns about the proposal, while addressing the Sahakarana Congress here on Saturday.
 
 “We will address all concerns and the issues raised by the leader of the Opposition will be examined,” said the minister, adding that the previous governments could not implement the proposal for the new bank because of the reluctance on the part of the director boards of 14 district cooperative banks controlled by the LDF and the UDF, as this director board would be abolished in the two-tier system.
 
 “In the modern times, we have to compete with new generation banks, so we have to modernize it, and hence the proposal for the new system under the umbrella of the KCB,” he said. Further, the KCB can accept   deposits which currently have not been accepted by the co-operative credit sector, he further said.
 
 “The NRI deposit in Kerala is to the tune of Rs 1.5 lakh crore and if we could moblise even 50 percent of it, it would boost the cooperative sector and the State’s development,” said the minister.
 
 Amalgamation anxiety
 
 In his speech, Ramesh Chennithala had said the experience of the recent merger of the associate banks with the   (SBI) has shown the amalgamation of banks would not yield the desired results. So, the proposal for replacing the existing three-tier systems with a two-tier system in the credit cooperative sector by merging the district cooperative banks with the KCB might not be fruitful. He had urged the government to hold discussions on the proposal and the recommendations of the M S Sreeram Committee report which recommended the formation of the new bank.
