NEW DELHI: BJP is likely to ask its district presidents and other office-bearers who are contesting in the civic polls to either step down or hand over the charge to someone else temporarily as they will be busy with campaigning. 

 Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari has called a meeting of candidates, and mandal and district presidents late on Tuesday night to discuss the campaign plan. “Senior leaders will attend the meeting,” said a BJP member.
 
 Though the party had said it won’t give tickets to office-bearers, the district presidents of Shahdara (Santosh Pal), Outer Delhi (Vinay Rawat), Parvesh Sharma (Naveen Shahdara) and Mayur Vihar (Diraj Joshi’s wife) and the in-charge of Mayur Vihar (Rajkumar Ballan) have been fielded. Several mandal presidents and their relatives have also got tickets. 
 
 The party’s decision to give ticket to Tilak Raj Kataria, in-charge of coordinators of all polling booths, has also not gone down well. “He has got a ticket for the first time. Will he focus on his own campaigning or take care of booth coordination at 13,000 polling booths?” asked an angry worker.
 
 At a recent rally, BJP chief Amit Shah stressed the importance of booth-level workers. For good coordination, BJP has appointed five people to look after one booth. “But if so many office-bearers will contest the elections, who will work at grassroots?” wondered a party worker. 
 
 “The district presidents oversee the entire election preparations in their areas. When they are contesting, how will they focus on other wards in the district?” asked another.
