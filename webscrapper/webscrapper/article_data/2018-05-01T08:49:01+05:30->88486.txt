LUCKNOW: The   who became the   and still draws many Koreans to a   to her in   has been inspiring people for over past 2,000 years. The queen’s story has now ignited a creative spark in filmmaker Jayanth Sinha, who has started working on a full length feature film on her life. Credited for making the first 5D film of India, Sinha has visited Ayodhya several times for the film’s script, which is in final stage.

 
 Princess Suriratna of Ayodhya got married to King Suro of Korea 2,000 years ago. The memorial of the princess, known as Queen Heo-Hwang-Ok or Queen Hu, in Ayodhya is a pilgrimage for South Koreans who consider themselves to be descendants of the royal couple.
 
 Asked what motivated him to make a  , Jayanth said, “The legend says that Princess Suriratna’s parents once had a dream wherein a divine voice instructed them to send their daughter to Geumgwan Gaya as its King Suro was yet to find a suitable queen. As directed, the royal couple made their daughter board a boat with many gifts to meet her husband. The princess eventually met the king and the two got married and had children. The legend serves as a perfect storyline waiting to be told on the big screen.”
 
 Jayanth added that another reason to make the film was its link with UP. “I have seen that a greater chunk of film industry hands come from UP and Bihar, many of whom are unknown even though their contribution is invaluable. It is my tribute to UP, my thanks to this indispensable lot,” he said.
 
 Prateek Hira, a tour operator, said, “As per 11th century Korean chronicle ‘Samyuk Yusa’, the wife of King Suro of the ancient Korean kingdom of Geumgwan Gaya was a princess who travelled by boat from a faraway land called Ayuta to Korea in 48 AD. Ayuta is the Korean colloquial for Ayodhya ,” he said.
 
 Prof Manoj Dixit, vicechancellor, RML Avadh University, Faizabad, said, “Gen is one of Queen Hu’s most famous descendants. He is credited for uniting the Korean kingdom in the 7th century.”
