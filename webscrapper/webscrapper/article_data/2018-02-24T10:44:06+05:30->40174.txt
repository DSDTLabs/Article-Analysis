HYDERABAD: Chief minister   has decided to appoint Nalgonda MP   Reddy as the first chairman of the state farmers’ corporation. Surprising everyone, he has asked the MP not to resign from his post before taking up the cabinet rank position. Instead, the state government is exploring ways to get an exemption from provisions of ‘office of profit’.

 “I am not going to resign even after taking over the state farmers’ corporation responsibility,” Sukhender Reddy told TOI on Friday. The chief minister will make an announcement on Saturday or Sunday on his appointment.
 
  
 The agriculture and law departments are burning the midnight oil to incorporate certain provisions in the bylaws of the corporation so that the chairman post does not attract the provisions of ‘office of profit’. “We will make it a non-remunerative post. We have also removed some of the perks that attract the ‘office of profit’ provisions under Articles 102(1) and 191(1),” said a senior official in the law department.
 
 The cases of Sonia Gandhi, Jaya Bachchan, Somnath Chatterjee and Shibu Soren have been examined and the bylaws of the corporation are being framed accordingly. The state government will also move a Bill in the assembly exempting the post from the list of posts that attract ‘office of profit’ provisions.
 
 Earlier, it was rumoured that the MP will have to sacrifice his   seat to take up the cabinet-rank post. The TRS government even prepared for a by-election in Nalgonda and was searching for an alternative candidate. But IT minister   opposed the byelection and prevailed upon his father to explore ways to get an exemption to the post.
