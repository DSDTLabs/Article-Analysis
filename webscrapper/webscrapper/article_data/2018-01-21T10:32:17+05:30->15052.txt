PATIALA: Punjabi University’s forensic department research on the changing or loss of   of cancer patients undergoing treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy is being deferred. The department wanted to conduct research on the variations in the changes of the fingerprints that may or may not leave an impact on crime investigations. However, they are not receiving cooperation from any of the leading medical institutes of the country to move ahead with the project. 

 The cancer patients, according to forensic science scholars, lose their fingerprints within a time period of two or more years. 
 
 “Fingerprints are the best source of detection for crime agencies for carrying out investigations. The crime agencies would be up for a major loss if the fingerprints of a person are lost as it will be a major setback for the course of the entire investigation. We want to conduct research over the variations in the fingerprints before and after treatment of cancer patients using chemotherapy or the radiotherapy. It is a matter of big concern as these people will not be able to use their Aadhar cards in India or other such facilities related with the fingerprints if the latter gets changed,” said Prof Mukesh Thakkar in the Department of Forensic Science in the   who leading the said research. 
 
 “We wrote to the reputed medical institutes and sought their permission to cooperate us in the research. One of the reputed cancer institutes in   had asked us to get permission from the ethical committee of   under which it falls. Some cancer institutes in Delhi fear that their patients will not to be comfortable with the idea, which might create a panic among them,” added Mukesh Thakkar.
 
 Notably in the past, a very few countries have conducted research over the loss of fingerprints after the cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy and found that around 50% of the cancer patients lose their fingerprints after undergoing the treatment with these therapies.
