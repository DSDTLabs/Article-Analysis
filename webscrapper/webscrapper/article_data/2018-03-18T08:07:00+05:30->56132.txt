GURUGRAM: The enforcement wing of the department of town and country planning ( ) cracked down on shop owners who had illegally encroached upon public corridors in a market place in Suncity.

 During the drive, officials removed encroachments from in front of 30-40 shops in the colony on   in Sector 54. 
 
 Officials said the drive was launched following a complaint on the CM Window wherein residents had alleged that shop keepers placed refrigerators, display boards, vegetables, fruits, medicines, grocery items, chai kiosks etc in the corridors. 
 
 Residents of the society alleged that despite repeated requests, the shopkeepers had refused to clear the common area, which forced them to lodge a complaint on the CM Window. 
 
 Acting on the CM Window complaint, the DTCP had issued notices to the erring shop owners around a month ago, asking them to remove all kids of encroachments on their own. “The shop owners did not comply with the order, and thus the crackdown,” said district town planner (enforcement) Rajendra T Sharma. 
 
 During the drive, DTCP officials also removed gates installed at four entry and exit points of the colony. “Suncity RWA had installed the gates on a 24-metre wide road, which is a clear violation of rules,” said Sharma.
