 may still be a few days away, but dandiya fervour has already gripped the city. And this dandiya raas event held in the city recently proves that. Dolled up in colourful ghagra cholis and matching accessories, mana P3Ps swayed to traditional garba steps and then switched to ‘salsa style’ dandiya (not even kidding!) as the venue pulsated with music, laughter and energy. In between showing off their mean moves, they bonded over a ‘zara hatke high-tea’ which features pav bhaji, chhole bhature, fruit chat and more.
