NEW DELHI: A 75-year-old woman was murdered allegedly during a robbery bid at her house in northwest Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh on Thursday afternoon. Her throat was slit with a knife, police said.

 Police suspect that the assailants entered the house in the guise of plumbers. A probe is on to ascertain if an acquaintance was involved in the murder. Till late on Sunday, cops had been unable to trace the killers or recover the weapon of offence.
 
 The deceased, Rajrani, stayed alone on the ground floor of a three-storey building located in A-Block of the area. The other two floors had been rented out. Her husband, Jaswant Singh, had died of natural causes a few years ago. Her two sons live in separate houses in the same colony and used to visit her often.
 
  
  
 
 Around 4.20pm, the police control room got a call by the woman’s son, Mickey, a property dealer. He was the first to notice her lying in a pool of blood next to her bed. He had been trying to reach her since noon, but when she did not respond to multiple calls he went to check on her.
 
 The crime and forensic experts found the entry friendly and the house ransacked. CCTV footage from an adjacent house shows a few men rushing out of the colony. Cops are trying to identify them. Footage from CCTV cameras in nearby areas is being scanned to get a clue about the direction in which the assailants fled.
 
 “A few gold items and cash are missing from her cupboard. We didn’t know who used to visit the house as we go out early and return late at night. People from the locality told us that the plumbers were seen in the area in the last two days. However, no one got suspicious of them as they had been seen working at our house,” Mickey said.
 
 Mickey said that he had last met his mother in the morning and promised her that he would have dinner with her. A case for robbery with intention to cause death and murder has been lodged at Shalimar Bagh police station.
