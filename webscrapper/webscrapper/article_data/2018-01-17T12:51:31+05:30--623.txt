Ludhiana: Three days after robbing an elderly Jamalpur resident at gunpoint, two out of six criminals who were part of the crime landed in the police net on Tuesday.

 The Moti Nagar police police have also recovered Rs 30,000 in cash, silver coins and a motorcycle used in the crime from the accused, identified as Kala and  .
 
 Those absconding have been identified as Ranjit Rana, former employee of Sehgal; Sunny, Shivam and Vikas. All six accused were residents of Rajiv Gandhi Colony.
 
 Assistant commissioner of police (east)   said the accused were captured in a CCTV camera installed outside a private school when they were fleeing after committing the crime on January 13.
 
 The ACP said, “Rana used to work for Sehgal around one-and-a-half years ago. He was the man who planned the crime as he knew that Sehgal used to keep some cash at home. The accused were also aware that Sehgal was old and his son is bed-ridden.”
 
 “On January 13 evening, the accused with their faces covered had barged into Sehgal’s house on the pretext of collecting alms for Lohri. They pointed a gun at his bed-ridden son and threatened to kill him. The accused took away Rs 1.25 lakh in cash, silver utensils, silver coins and silver idol from the house. A case was registered against them at Moti Nagar police station,”   said.
 
 The cop said the accused had used a toy pistol, however, the same would be verified once all accused are arrested.
