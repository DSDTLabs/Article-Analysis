NAGPUR: Owing to  , three red bus operators are not able to increase number of fleets on city roads. “Over 60 buses, which are ready to operate, are off the roads in  ,” confirmed one of the city bus operators, requesting anonymity. 

 With introduction of new red bus operators from December last year, the   had has assigned to provide electronic ticketing machines through   (DIMTS). Integrated Bus Transport Manager (IBTM) operator was given the task for identifying routes, managing conductors, revenue and encouraging public transport.
 
 As per agreement, each bus should have two ETMs. But so far, the NMC’s transport department could manage only 200 electronic ticketing machines. Actually for 200 buses,   needed 400 ETMs. Presently, the ETMs are not there as per number of buses and its shift wise with DIMTs. Moreover, the process to invite tenders for the ETMs is still pending. Hence, with limited 200 machines, the three red bus operators are running only 200 buses, forcing many conductors to do 16 hours shift also so that shift wise they don’t have to change machines codes again and again,” said a source. 
 
 The bus operator also revealed that the new buses have come but they are idle. “We were told to make old buses stand and operate only the new ones. But as per law, old buses cannot stand ideal as government property needs to be utilized as per Urban Ministry rules for JNNURM etc,” he pointed out. “City also needs 450 to 500 buses and mini buses for Mahal, Itwari, Besa, Beltarodi inner areas. So, why can’t DIMTS do manual slip tickets temporarily and give services to Nagpurians on all routes,” he said. The number of buses will definitely lessen vehicular traffic on city roads.
 
 A senior official from NMC’s transport department confirmed the shortfall of ETMs and claimed that the tenders will be invited to procure more ETMs. Besides this, repair works of old ETMs, that were with ousted Vansh Nimay Infraprojects, is also under progress.
