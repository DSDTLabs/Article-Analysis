MADURAI: With the deadline given by the Madurai bench of the Madras high court to remove prosopis juliflora trees from government and private lands nearing; Madurai district administration and the city   took stock of the works to remove the invasive weed on Saturday. 

 District collector K   and corporation commissioner   visited various spots where the tree are being removed. Together, they inspected the stretch from the district court to the Madurai bench in   and also places like Judges Quarters, Ulaganeri, Vandiyoor Tank and the district court premises.
 
 It is estimated that the trees, which deplete water, and thus threatening local ground water table, are spread in around 500 hectares, district administration sources said. 
 
 "Works have been expedited to clear them. So far, 194.2 hectares of area has been cleared of the trees. Earthmovers have been pressed into work to clear the rest of the areas," an official told TOI.
 
 The city corporation has also formed teams under assistant commissioners to remove the trees from the city limits. Residents in the city were asked to remove the trees from their properties immediately, failing which, the city corporation, under the Madurai Corporation Rule 1971, Sections 329 and 479, will clear the trees from private properties and collect the expense along with a fine. 
 
 After issuing the warning, the corporation has sent notices to 183 private land owners about clearing the trees from their lands. 
 
 Corporation commissioner Sandeep Nanduri has instructed corporation officials to complete the task on a war footing. 
 
 Though the local bodies are working on removing the invasive weed from government lands, the trees are very much present in good number on private lands, lush green and thriving. The local administrations have to deal with the private owners, coercing them to remove the trees, before the Madurai bench's deadline ends.
