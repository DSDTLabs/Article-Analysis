VADODARA: A resident of New Sama Road was cheated by three persons who promised him work visa of Dubai but sent him on a tourist visa. 

 The travel agents had taken Rs 1.4 lakh from the victim  . Five more persons have also come forward to lodge a complaint against the trio.
 
 Prajapati was given an offer letter and work visa of Dubai by Margi Naik and Keyur Patel at their office in Mangaldeep Complex in Alkapuri. Police also booked Devang Laheri from whose shop Naik and Patel were operating. Later, they had moved their office near Pandya bridge.
 
 Police said that Prajapati was not aware that he had gone there on a tourist visa and therefore he continued to stay there even after his visa expired after a month. As a result, he was fined Rs 50,000 for flouting the visa conditions and he was deported to India.
 
 Besides Prajapati, five other persons, who were duped by Naik and Patel, have complained to the police. A police official said that the offer letter given by the duo were fake and in all Rs 20.47 lakh were taken from the complainants.
 
 “We are questioning some people related to the case and we will arrest the accused soon,” said Gotri police sub-inspector R K Rajput, who is investigating the case.
