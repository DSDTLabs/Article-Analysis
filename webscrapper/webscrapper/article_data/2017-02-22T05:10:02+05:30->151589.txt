MUMBAI: In the Muslim-majority ward 223 of Dongri, politics trumps civic issues. One of the city’s earliest settled areas, it is mired in crumbling infrastructure and legacy   such as rent control and redevelopment. Yet, many voters are unlikely to shift loyalties.

 Thanks to delimitation, one-third of former Congress corporator Waqarunnisa Ansari’s Ward 222 has got merged with Congress’s Dnyanraj Nikam’s Ward 221 and become Ward 223, one that’s reserved for women. Ansari quit Congress when she was denied the ticket and joined Majlis-e-Ittahadul Muslimeen (MIM), which made her their candidate. Congress chose Nikam’s daughter Nikita, but this seems to have angered a section of Muslim voters.
 
 “Waqar Apa represented the area twice and had worked a lot. Yet, Congress did great injustice to her,” said Salahuddin Tinwala, a resident as he emerged from a polling booth at Imam Hussain chowk.
 
 Opinion is divided on whether Ansari can win just on Muslim votes. Nikita might have an edge if she finds acceptance from non-Muslims. Another major claimant to the non-Muslim vote is Shiv Sena candidate   who was moved to Ward 223 from Ward 213 where she represented MNS in the last BMC polls. “Mamadi was perceived as an outsider by a section of local Shiv Sainiks and so they have backed the Congress candidate,” said former MLA Sohail Lokhandwala.
 
 Meanwhile, SP candidate Dr Neda Fathima, despite her profile—she’s a state topper in dentistry exams—is unlikely to be more than a “spoiler” for Ansari or Nikita. tnn
