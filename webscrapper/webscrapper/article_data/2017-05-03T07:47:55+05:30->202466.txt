CHENNAI: The University of Madras will withdraw all study centres of the   (IDE) located outside Tamil Nadu as well as those within the   from the 2017-18 academic year. A decision to this effect was taken in the syndicate meeting on April 21.

 Madras University’s IDE has 50 study centres, 28 of which are outside Tamil Nadu, including in Kuwait, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Only 15 study centres are in Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts.
 
 Students who are already enrolled in the University’s IDE programme need not worry as all the study centres will conduct exams for the next three years, up to December 2019/January 2020 without affecting the career of students admitted up to the 2016-17 academic year and 2017 calendar year. A copy of the relevant minutes of the syndicate meeting is with TOI.
 
 The decision was taken to gradually comply with the   ( ) direction putting an embargo on institutions offering distance education courses outside their jurisdiction, said sources in  .
 
 As per a September 2016 circular, distance education programmes of only two universities in Tamil Nadu are recognised by the UGC. Madras, Madurai Kamarajar and   had obtained a stay on the UGC order from the Madras high court.
 
 A senior official in the higher education department said that MKU and Bharatiar University managements would also be gradually nudged towards complying with the UGC order on the distance education territorial jurisdiction.
 
 The IDE is a cash cow for the University, earning a revenue of Rs 44 crore in 2015-16. However, the student enrolment has dwindled by 40 percent to around 22,000 students in 2015-16. The revenue in 2016-17 was even lower, a source confirmed.
 
 Experts said that the UGC stricture was a key reason for the drop in IDE admissions. “Wide publicity given by UGC via advertisements has created a doubt in people’s minds if their degrees would become invalid in future,” said M Ravichandran, former IDE director in Madras University.
