MYSURU: The 125-year-old   is likely to get African or   from Singapore Zoo. The zoo on Thursday received four elephants from Bandipur Tiger Reserve and it initiated the process for exchanging them for animals from Singapore Zoo. It has written to the   (CZA) for permission.

 The zoo sought elephants from the forest department four years ago but it has been pending for various reasons. Officials on Thursday handed over four elephant calves, aged 3-4 years. The Singapore Zoo, which had spared animals including a pair of meerkat and a pair of chimpanzees earlier, had sought elephants from Mysuru Zoo in exchange for rhinos. The plan was shelved as Mysuru zoo didn’t get CZA approval. Now, a fresh application was moved after the zoo received the elephants.
 
 
 The zoo, which doesn’t have African and White Rhinos, is trying its luck to get them. At present, it has a pair of Indian Rhinos.
 
  Zoo has been adding exotic animals to its inventory and now has a collection of animals from different parts of the globe. In the recent past, it has exchanged African Hunting Cheetahs from Germany Zoo, Green Anacondas from   and meerkats and chimpanzees from Singapore Zoo.
 
 C  , zoo executive director, said: “We’re hopeful of getting rhinos and other animals from Singapore Zoo this time as we’re ready with the elephants. These elephant calves can be easily airlifted.”
