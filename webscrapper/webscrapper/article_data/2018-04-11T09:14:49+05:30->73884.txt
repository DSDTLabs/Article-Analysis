CHENNAI:   Kumar(Name changed) did everything expected of a responsible person when he spotted a snake crawling over the compound wall of his house at   on Sunday.)

 [The snake] was around 2ft long and had crawled through a crevice in the wall. There were children at home,” he said. Overcome by panic, he called the state fire service and rescue department, who put him through to a snake rescuer/activist. “The man (snake rescuer) told me to ignore the snake because it was likely to be non-venomous and that it will move away eventually. How could I take that risk with children at home?” he said.
 
 Eventually, a group of local residents ganged up, thrashed and killed the snake. “When he (rescuer) called me back, I told him our people handled the situation. The man went on to lecture me about how wildlife shouldn’t be harmed. He should have responded better,” Arun said.
 
 This situation highlights the disconnect experienced by local residents when reaching out for help after being startled by nocturnal visitors. According to forest department officials, most snakes found in the city are harmless. “There are around 30 species found in Chennai. Only four are venomous — cobra, krait and vipers,” said aforest official.
 
 Shravan  , animal activist and snake rescuer, told TOI that around 50 snake alerts are received during summer days. “During rainy season, we receive around 100 calls. Mostly, we ignore calls about snakes found in open ground and on trees because people need to know that snakes are also part of our ecosystem,” he said.
 
 While Krishnan argued for creating awareness among residents, proffering tips over the phone would not help the situation. “It would be difficult to tell a person reaching out to us via phone whether a snake is venomous or not. It is important not to misguide people,” he said.
