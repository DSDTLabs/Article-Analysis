Dabboo Ratnani’s calendar launch kicked off with Bolllywood’s young guns, Varun Dhawan, Tiger Shroff and Kriti Sanon making an early appearance. While Tiger and Kriti indulged in a mock punching match,   walked in dressed in a black and white ensemble, sending the cameras into a tizzy.
Meanwhile, Sunny Leone, who features in the calendar for the first time, sauntered in, holding husband Daniel Weber’s hand.   and   were the last two stars to grace the launch.   arrived wearing a jacket with ‘Raees’ embossed on it. Later, he also turned photographer and made Dabboo pose for his camera.
