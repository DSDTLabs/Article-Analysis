RANCHI: The state government is all set to take a leaf out of Singapore's education model for providing   to the youth. 

 The state higher and technical education department on Monday hinted that it is mulling a revision of courses at the graduation and university levels and draw up specific curricula aimed at job-oriented skill development training. 
 
 "In Singapore, out of the total students enrolling for university courses, 25% opt for university education. Roughly, 25% go for polytechnic education and nearly 40% for skill development," Ajay Kumar Singh, secretary of the state higher and technical education said at an awards function organized by Assocham at a city hotel. 
 
 Singh said with  's growth rate standing currently at 8.6%, the state needs to produce more skilled labour to power industrial growth. "For that to happen, our education system needs to change," he added. 
 
 With roughly 1.05 crore of the state's 3.5 crore population aged between 18 years and 35 years, the department stressed on the need to produce more employment in the manufacturing and service sectors. Using the platform, the department called on the state's corporate houses to participate in the training process. 
 
 In its preliminary model, the department is contemplating designing job-oriented curricula at the university level. Trained people, namely those from the industrial units and corporate houses, will be roped in as teachers, who in turn will be able to provide hands-on training to the students. The courses will also have a six-month internship period for the students, who will be sent to different industrial units for apprenticeship, said Singh. 
 
 In another effort to boost skill development, Singh said the department will be inking a   (MoU) with a   for opening a mega skill development centre in the state in the coming days.
