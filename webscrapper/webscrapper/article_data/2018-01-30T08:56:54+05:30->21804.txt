SURAT: There is ample scope for manipulation during   once the views of the citizens have been obtained. There is an uneven spread with respect to the   under the present system of Swachh Survekshan. This is why some people feel that there should be a separate category for cities with population of more than 2.5 million to arrive at right conclusions with regard to  . 

 “It is unfair to compare a city of 2 lakh with one that has 50 lakh population. It would be better if all cities above 2.5 million population are put in one category and judged,” an SMC officer said. 
 
 “To meet all the  , a city would need adequate funds. Surat has been spending nearly Rs 150 crore on cleanliness and still is not getting the recognition it deserves,” another civic official added. 
 
 Surat used to spend nearly Rs 36 crore on lifting   and night cleaning and brushing six years ago. Today, this exercise incurs an expense of over Rs 80 crore. This is why it is not right to put on same pedestal a city spending Rs 150 crore and another just Rs 10 crore in a year on cleanliness, the SMC officer said.
 
 Municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said, “It is difficult to judge two cities having an unequal population. We wish the central government creates separate categories to do justice to all.”
