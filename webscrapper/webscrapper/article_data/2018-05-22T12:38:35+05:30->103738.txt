CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court has issued notice to UT administration and Chandigarh Renewable Energy and Science and Technology Promotion Society ( ) on a petition seeking quashing of the order to install solar power plants atop residential and non-residential buildings

 The matter would come up for hearing on August 20.
 
 Col Pritpal Singh Gill (retd), 97, a resident of Sector 35, in his petition, argued he was under mental stress and tension and disturbed by the “illegal and arbitrary action of the administration” of making it mandatory to install solar panels.
 
 Advocate Prateek Gupta, who was representing Gill, said the administration has no power under Section 4 of the 1952 Act to issue such a notification. He said the administration had decided not to extend the deadline, May 18, for installation of solar power plants in houses and asked the estate office to ensure compliance of the notification. “Ordering the estate office to issue notices for resumption of plots who had failed to comply with the directions amounted to intimidation,” Gupta said.
 
 The notification had said all residential buildings of new construction and that which have been reconstructed would have to install solar power plants of a capacity depending on the size of the plot. Besides, solar plants were to be installed in all private educational institutes and government buildings.
