6.5 crore Indians suffer from cardiovascular disease and 6.51 crore people suffer from diabetes, as per latest public health reports. These numbers being so close isnâ€™t completely a coincidence. Statistics show that eight out of every 10 diabetics develop heart disease. 

 High glucose in blood for prolonged period compromises the  , affecting various functions that are integral in maintaining blood flow to heart muscle. Uncontrolled diabetes decreases fluidity of blood making it more prone to clot. In addition, people with diabetes develop soft plaques that are more vulnerable to rupture in the coronary. Upon rupture it triggers clotting of blood which clogs the coronary artery causing heart attack. 
 
 Each time you consume added sugar, overeat or binge-starve yourself,   spike to levels that require extra insulin to be generated to normalise it. In a predisposed individual eventually, it would result in insulin resistance. One of the major causes of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance which is rising at an epidemic rate in India. This means that your body gradually starts to lose its ability to bring blood glucose levels down to healthy levels. 
 
 To lower the risk of diabetes, even if there is no family history, maintain a healthy balanced lifestyle. If already diabetic, lower the risk of heart disease by consciously keeping your blood glucose levels under control.
 
 Uncontrolled blood sugar is the dangerously sweet highway to developing heart disease. Stay off this highway to live a better quality, fit and healthy life!
