KOLKATA: The CBI may call him an “absconder“, but a state intelligence report to the Centre cites   -an accused in the 2010 Madan Tamang murder case who fled from CID custody -is acting as a go-between between the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha and a Nepal-based Maoist faction. It is Tamang, the report suggests, who has built bridges with the Maoist leader Mohan Baidya whose group is providing training to the Gorkha Liberation Army (GLA) and   (GLP) with a promise to supply ammunition. The GJM has consistently rubbished such allegations as “malicious propaganda“ and has even challenged the police to back their claim with proof. Worse, the report even suggests that two groups of GLP -one consisting of 145 members and another with 165 -are being trained in the deep forest on the Mahabharat foothills around Dharan Bazar at Sansuri district in east Nepal.

 “There is ample evidence the GJM movement is getting strong support from the   (Revolutionary Maoist) and there might be some other foreign influence working with them to destabilise the country . We are gathering information on this issue,“ an officer said.
 
 The report says the beleaguered party was suffering from fund crunch and dearth of ammunition. Sources suggested at present, they are in need of nearly 2 lakh rounds of bullets -particularly of sniper,   and AK-47 -which they had purchased from northeast insurgent groups. But because of topographical disadvantage, they failed to procure ammunition.
 
 This was also the time when Nicole -perceived close to the top GJM leadership -came to their rescue and worked as a bridge between the groups, the report claims.
 
 Nicole escaped from the CID custody in Pintail village in 2010. The CBI says Nicole is hiding in Nepal.
