AGARTALA: The last leg of campaigning in   has picked up pace. BJP national president   kicked off his roadshow, followed by rallies across West Tripura and Khowai districts. 

 His first road show — from Bamutia to Mohanpur — was followed by rallies at Chowmanu and Teliamura. In the afternoon, he led a road show from Chandrapur to Agartala. Hitting back at   for his accusation that the Centre had not done much for the state’s development, the BJP chief listed a number of central schemes and said it had released Rs 25,396 crore to Tripura under the 14th finance commission, against the Rs 7,283 crore it had got under the 13th finance commission. 
 
 “Where has the extra Rs 18,000 crore gone? It has gone into pockets of Communist cadres. I dare Sarkar to give an account of this money in his public meeting,” Shah said. 
 
 “The government of Lal bhai and its cadres has looted Tripura for 25 years in the name of development,” he added. Without naming  , he said the   chief has put up candidates as ‘vote-katva’ to help the CPM government to come back to power.
