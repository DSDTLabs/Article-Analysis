CHANDIGARH: It’s been a turbulent one year for the Captain   Singh-led   government in   since it came to power on March 11 last year. There have been some highs – like farm debt waiver being implemented (loopholes and all), cracking the case of targeted killings of Hindu leaders and successfully demolishing some of the organized gangs in the state.

 But the new government has also seen some controversies. Like cabinet minister   resigning over allegations of him clandestinely putting up his employees as fronts in sand mining auctions. Privately, many Congress men complain that the CM is inaccessible and that the bureaucrats have too much control.
 
 TOI caught up with Amarinder recently to discuss how he saw the past year and what he has planned for the future. He defended his decision of not sitting in the secretariat. “I have a full-fledged official residence, which is more conducive to entertaining a large number of people, including officials who come to meet me every day. Besides, I hold meetings at Punjab Bhawan. The Secretariat office cannot accommodate such a huge number on a daily basis and provide the privacy needed to conduct official business.”
 
 He added that cabinet meetings are held in the secretariat. “Whether it is MLAs or officials or citizens of Punjab, all they have to do is take an appointment and meet me.”
 
 He also rejected the contention that the bureaucracy has become more powerful and officers do not even listen to MLAs. “I have not received such complaints...I meet MLAs regularly and I am also constantly interacting with the bureaucracy. I have made it clear to both that they have to work together, in a spirit of mutual respect, in the interest of the state and its people. It is quite evident that things are moving in the right direction. Difference of opinion cannot, and should not be interpreted as complaints by either side.”
