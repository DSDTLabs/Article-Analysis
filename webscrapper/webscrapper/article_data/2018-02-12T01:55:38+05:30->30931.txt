GREATER NOIDA:   said on Sunday anyone willing to join his movement against corruption would have to sign an affidavit saying he would not join   or contest elections.

 Speaking to TOI, Hazare said 5,000 such   had been collected so far. “Nothing political. Anyone who wants to join us can give an affidavit on a 100-rupee bond stamp saying he or she would not join any political party and would not contest elections,” he said. “The person will have to follow a five-pointer formula for joining us. The formula includes that he or she will work for public service….”
 
 Asked if he was upset with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who parted ways with his   movement to form the Aam Aadmi Party, he said Kejriwal “did the opposite”.
 
 A “sudden” denial by the administration to allow Hazare’s rally at a Dadri college triggered a protest by farmers who threatened a “jail bharo andolan”. The rally was later held on a private land. 
 
 Three members of the Corruption-Free India Force, a Greater Noida-based outfit, have started a cycle rally to garner support for Hazare’s agitation on March 23.
