NEW DELHI: At 13, she had almost become a bride. Her parents didn’t want her to study further. Seven years hence, she’s all set to represent India in the US to raise funds for the organisation and charitable programme that saved her from being denied a chance to do well in life. 

 Meet   Khan (20) from   Basti, who would raise funds for an education programme for girls by NGO Room to Read in New York and Washington DC on May 11 and 15, respectively. She has done this earlier in the UK and Zurich, Switzerland.
 
 The daughter of a rickshaw-puller, the going was tough for Khan who grew up in a household of eight people. There were days when there would be nothing to eat, she recalled. Then her marriage was planned. “I asked my mother if she too wanted me to be physically weak like her because she too was married off at a very young age. And what if my husband didn’t earn enough? Then I said if I study, I would be able to help the family financially,” Khan said. 
 
 After studying in a “useless” government school, Khan found Room to Read. Today, she is a second-year student in Jamia Millia Islamia—the first in her family to study in a college. To help her family financially, though, she works as an assistant at a dermatology clinic near her home. 
 
 “We concentrate our efforts during a girl’s transition into secondary school in Class VI and VII when she has a high risk of dropping out,” said Sourav Banerjee, country director of Room to Read.
