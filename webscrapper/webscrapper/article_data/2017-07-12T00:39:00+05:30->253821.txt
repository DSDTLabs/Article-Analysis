 Chandigarh: City businessmen have claimed that the hotel industry suffered Rs 50 crore loss since the ban on serving of alcohol in eateries within 500 metre from national highways came into effect in the first week of April.
 
 “There are around 90 hotels in Chandigarh and each suffered losses in lakhs of rupees every month. Around 5,000 employees lost their jobs. More than 20,000 households were affected. Many bars and hotels were shut,” said Arvinder Pal Singh, president, Chandigarh Hotel Association. The Supreme Court order has lifted their spirits now. “We see some ray of hope. We will meet the home secretary and appeal to allow hotels and bars within the municipal corporation limits to serve liquor,” he added.
 
 But forgetting those “bad days” will be hard for many. “These three months were like hell. Two of my outlets were completely shut in Chandigarh. Outlets in cities like Ludhiana bore losses due to liquor ban,” said Vipul Dua, owner of a popular chain of restaurants. He is hopeful of getting back to business.
 
 Ankit Gupta, president, Chandigarh Hospitality Association, said the Supreme Court order has come as a huge relief. “All our problems will be gone. Things will finally fall in place,” he said.
