MOHALI: After being the country’s food bowl for four decades, time has come for Punjab to move beyond agriculture, says chief minister Captain  .

 Speaking at TOI event ‘Mohali: The Next Big IT Hub’ here on Tuesday, the CM said that agriculture had its place in the economy but there was a need to explore the other avenues as well for creating job opportunities in Punjab. “For many decades, Punjab’s contribution to India’s production of   and rice has been substantial. Time demands that we should also focus on other sectors that can give jobs to our people,” Amarinder said.
 
 Amarinder said of the state’s almost 3 crore population, nearly 90 lakh was either jobless or underpaid. He identified it as a major reason for drug addiction in the state. “Frustration creeps in the youngsters when they fail to find work, and this is when they take a wrong path. It’s our duty to bring those who went astray back into the mainstream by giving them quality education and jobs,” the CM said.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 With Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal also producing   and wheat, Punjab has to look elsewhere, says Amarinder. For creating more jobs, he is looking at bringing more IT companies into   and making the city a hub of information technology. He underlined the need for improving the standard of education in government schools for preparing young people for the job market.
 
 He said: “Mohali will be a catalyst in tapping the potential of the state’s youth”. “I want to see it grow as a major technological hub in north,” he said. “The city is being equipped with all the necessary facilities.” Amarinder said that in the next five years, his government would keep the development of Mohali a continued process towards technological growth.
