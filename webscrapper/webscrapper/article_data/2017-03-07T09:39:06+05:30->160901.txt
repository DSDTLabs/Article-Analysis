JAIPUR: The state government will soon constitute a dedicated committee to work on measures to boost conservation of the Great Indian Bustard ( ) keeping in mind the development of villages in   (DNP). The assurance came from state forest minister Gajendra Singh when the matter was raised by Jaisalmer MLA Chottu Singh, who during the zero hour talked about the problems the villagers living near DNP faced.

 “There are farmers whose farms fall into the demarked DNP area and they are not allowed farming there. They are stopped in the name of strict rules framed for the conservation of GIB,” Chottu Singh said. He demanded that the state government should make provisions for providing basic amenities to villages which fall in the DNP area. He also demanded action against officials who were harassing villagers unnecessarily.
 
 Forest minister Gajendra Singh, in his reply, admitted that there were certain problems faced by the villagers but said that the rules had to be enforced to protect the state bird. “The numbers are fast dwindling and there are only 100 GIBs. These are shy birds and move away from human settlements. Already we are facing problems as the birds in the park have chosen to move within Army’s firing ranges in Jaisalmer,’’ he informed the house.
 
 He further said that the Rajasthan government had last year announced Great Indian Bustard project of Rs 12 crore. “I admit that some part of the money received for the development of the DNP should be used for development of the villages in the periphery,” he said.
 
 He assured everyone that a committee would be formed soon which would look into all concerned aspects along with conservation of the state bird under the Great Indian Bustard project. “Elected members including you (Chottu Singh) would be part of the committee. The committee will focus on ensuring both protection of the bird and development of the locals,” he said.
