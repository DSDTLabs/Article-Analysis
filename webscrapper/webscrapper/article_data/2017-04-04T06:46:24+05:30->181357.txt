Mumbai: Several ATMs were out of   as bank account holders withdrew their salaries. 

 Bankers in the city said there was cash shortage as deposits were not keeping pace with withdrawals, which had picked up steam at the end of the financial year that coincided with the weekend.
 
 The dry ATMs brought back memories of demonetisation. Customers in different parts of the city complained that all ATMs in their area were out of cash since Sunday. “There is some cash shortage as there have been a lot of withdrawals. We normally see heavy withdrawals in the first week of April,” said Navroze Dastur, MD and CEO of NCR India. Some bankers said that cash deposits in branches had slowed down.
