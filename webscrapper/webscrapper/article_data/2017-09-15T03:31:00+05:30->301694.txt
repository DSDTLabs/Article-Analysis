Margao: Agriculture minister   Sardesai has embarked on a mission to revive the age-old Gaonkari system of community farming in Goa. On Thursday, Sardesai held a meeting with local farmers at Utorda and urged them to come together to form a cooperative to undertake farming activities in the village, even as he assured them of the government’s wholehearted support in such an endeavour.

 Voicing his opinion in favour of the state enacting a legislation on contract farming, Sardesai stressed on the need for all villages to have cooperative societies that would undertake collective agricultural activities in rural areas. 
 
 “Bring cooperative system in farming; the government will fully support the initiative...if Goemkarponn has to be preserved it will be only through agriculture,” Sardesai told the farmers. Urging them to ensure that no land remains barren, Sardesai exhorted the farmers to avail of the various schemes introduced by the state government. 
 
 He also assured them of setting up farmers’ markets to help them with their agro produce. He also spoke of adopting a village to revive farming in a big way.
