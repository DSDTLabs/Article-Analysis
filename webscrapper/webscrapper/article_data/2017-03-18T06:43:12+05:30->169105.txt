KOLKATA: The National Commission for Protection of   ( ) on Friday wrote to the   DM a second time, seeking a clarification on 15 points over baby trafficking. 

 NCPCR member Priyanka Kanungo, who visited Jalpaiguri—from where most of the trafficking cases were reported—last week, said the DM had not responded earlier. 
 
 The letter sought to know why the Jalpaiguri child welfare committee ( ) was allowed to operate between 2013 and 2015, as there was no such provision under the Juvenile Justice Act. The commission also wanted to know the number of infants the ad hoc committee allowed to be adopted during the period. 
 
 The state commission chairperson, Ananya Chakraborty, however, said they were satisfied with the CID probe and the way the Jalpaiguri CWC functioned. “It was the state, which ordered a probe after trafficking cases were reported. NCPCR members have violated the Juvenile Justice Act as they took media inside the shelter homes,” she said.
