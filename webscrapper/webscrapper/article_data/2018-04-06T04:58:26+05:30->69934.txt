MUMBAI: State   led by former chief minister Ashok Chavan on Thursday launched a frontal attack on the  , saying at a juncture when farmers were committing suicides in Mantralaya, the party had organised a grand event on Friday to mark the party’s foundation day.

 “BJP has no moral right to celebrate foundation day in view of the fact that in the recent past farmers committed suicide in Mantralaya. In addition, BJP quietly dropped at least 50 lakh farmers from the loan waiver scheme. I am told BJP will be spending crores on the event,” Congress spokesperson   said.
 
 As soon as the loan waiver scheme was launched, the cooperation department dropped 12 lakh farmers, subsequently another eight lakh were excluded on technical grounds. The number of farmers dropped from the list eventually crossed the 50 lakh mark.
 
 “Chief minister   is misleading the farmers as there appears to be lack of seriousness. This government is anti-farmer,’’ Sawant said. On June 28, 2017, when the CM declared the scheme, it was proposed to grant benefit to 89 lakh farmers with the amount pegged at Rs 32,022 crore. Immediately after, the cooperation department claimed only 69 lakh farmers were eligible for the loan waiver.
 
 According to Sawant, notwithstanding the tall claims of the CM, the loan waiver scheme has failed to take off owing to lack of political will. “The CM was never serious, but when the UP CM declared the loan waiver scheme, he had no option but follow him,” he said.
