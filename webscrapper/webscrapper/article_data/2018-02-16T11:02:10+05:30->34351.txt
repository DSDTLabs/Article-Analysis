BHOPAL: State Congress on Thursday demanded a clarification from PM Narendra Modi on the Nirav Modi  .

 State Congress president Arun Yadav said, “Both liquor baron Vijay Mallya and jewellery czar   were in touch with top leadership of BJP. Nirav Modi case is the biggest bank forgery in India. It is now the duty of the PM and finance minister   to give a detailed explanation as to why they took no action against the fraudster.”
 
 PCC chief spokesman K K Mishra said, “People of this country will no longer keep money in banks for fear of Nirav Modi and they cannot keep money at home for fear of Narendra Modi.” Mishra said it is impossible that a scam of more than Rs 11,360 crore can take place without the support and protection of those in power.
 
 “The PM’s office knew of irregularities, Nirav Modi left the country and was photographed with PM Modi at Davos as part of the business delegation. Everyone can see through what actually happened,” Mishra said. PCC legal cell chief JP Dhanopia argued that there has to be an investigation into Nirav Modi’s connections with the high and mighty. “The grand nexus that led to this scam has to be exposed. A nationalised bank has been duped to an extent that never happened before. How did he manage to get such a huge loan? Who gave the security and under whose protection?” Dhanopia asked.
