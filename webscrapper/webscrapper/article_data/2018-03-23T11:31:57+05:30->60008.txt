NAGPUR: After much delay, Nagpur Municipal Corporation has now decided to carry out animal birth control (ABC) exercise on its own to reduce stray dogs numbers in the city. “ABC will commence from March 26,” NMC’s veterinary officer Dr Gajendra Mahalle informed health consultative committee chairman   in the health department review meeting here on Thursday.

 Dr Mahalle later told TOI,   will carry out ABC operations at its animal shelter in Bhandewadi. The work of setting up operation theatre is almost complete and the civic body has already appointed three more veterinarians. At present, NMC has two dog catcher squads with two personnel in each. 
 
 In February, TOI had reported animal activists were complaining about NMC neglecting ABC operations leading to widespread infections and death of some strays. Complaints were also made to NMC, police and Union minister   who is the chairperson of People for Animals ( ). 
 
 Chafle also briefed media on other decisions in the meeting. He NMC would provide normal delivery services free of cost but will charge Re1 for caesarean section deliveries at its upcoming Devadiya Maternity Hospital, he said. NMC is constructing state-of-the-art-hospital by investing Rs15 crore, said Chafle. He also announced that those opting for delivery in NMC-run hospital will get Rs600 under a state government scheme.
 
 Chafle said NMC would develop gasifier crematorium facility at Mokshadham. It will be developed on the lines of Pune, he said adding that about 125 to 150 kilos of wood chips will be required to incinerate one body in a biomass gasifier. “As against this, the usual open air pyre consumes about 500 to 600kg firewood. Hence, the new facility is economical and eco-friendly," he said. Chafle recently visited Pune to study the system.
