 Kukshi SDM Rishabh Shukla told reporters that the administrative officials held a dialogue with Prajapat and informed him that a sum of Rs 3 lakh was transferred into his account. He will also receive Rs 2.80 lakh after his house will be demolished. “Thus he agreed to vacate the area and NDRF teams helped him out,” he said.
 
 The SDM said that the Narmada water level has touched 128.3 meters due to constant rainfall.
 
 NDRF team commander   told reporters that as many as five rescue teams are keeping a sharp vigil in Nisarpur, Karodia, Chikalda and Koteshwar, where backwaters have low-lying areas. Twelve boats have been kept ready to avoid any untoward incident.
