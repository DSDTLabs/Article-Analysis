NEW DELHI: Finally the wait is over for both book vendors as well as book lovers. Delhi's famous weekly market in old city   opened after five weeks on Sunday - albeit truncated to half its size. 

  ( ) only gave permission to set up shops between   cinema and Delite cinema. The civic body did not allow any shops on the Daryaganj over-bridge, due to which more than 50 people were not allowed to set up their makeshift shops.
 
 On their level, shopkeepers tried to help each other by reducing their shop sizes and also allowed other booksellers to sit nearby. However, they feel the authorities can do this in a better manner. "If they fix size for each shop, we all can fit in small spaces," said a shopkeeper Saeed. 
 
 Although there was uncertainty over the market, the book lovers came in a good number looking for their favourite books.
