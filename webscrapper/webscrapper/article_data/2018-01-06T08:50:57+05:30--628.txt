CHANDIGARH: Congress chief spokesperson and Kaithal MLA Randeep Singh   on Friday called on President Ram Nath Kovind and requested him not to give his assent on the bill related to cancellation of the Dadupur-Nalwi canal project in Haryana.

 Surjewala led a delegation of former MLAs, farmers and Congress leaders.
 
 He said the project would have helped 225 villages in north Haryana. In a memorandum submitted to the President, Surjewala also highlighted the problems faced by residents of the state, especially farmers, due to alleged wrong policies of the   government.
 
 He said the Dadupur-Nalwi project began in 1985 and it was relaunched in 2005 when the Congress came to power in Haryana. He said with the government scrapping the project, the farmers would be forced to pay Rs 10 to 20 lakh which they received in lieu of the compensation for acquisition of their land.
 
 “Besides this, there are overbridges and roads on 10km of a road in the affected land. The government will have to demolish such roads and bridges in case the project is shelved. This will also force closure of   project as well,” said the Congress media communication cell in-charge.
