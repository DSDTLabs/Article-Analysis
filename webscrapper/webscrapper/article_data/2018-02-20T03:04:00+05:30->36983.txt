Tension prevailed at the Special New Born Care Unit at Government General Hospital in Kakinada on Monday night as sparks emerged from a device called Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) which works as a ventilator for newborns. 

 Soon after the sparks began flying, round 30 inmates of the neonatal unit ran out of the ward in panic cradling their newborns in their arms. A minor stampede-like situation was witnessed at the ward due to the commotion. Luckily, no injuries were reported in the incident
 
 The doctors who were on duty at the time of the incident immediately stripped the device of power and alerted emergency services. Police and fire officials rushed to the spot to ensure safety of the patients.
 
 After ensuring that there was no further danger, hospital authorities asked inmates to return to the unit without fear. While most of the inmates returned to the ward, some of them were reportedly still waiting outside.
 
 Talking to TOI,   superintendent M Raghavendra Rao termed the sparks flying out of the CPAP machine as a ‘small technical glitch’. He clarified that there was no short-circuit and added that all patients returned.
 
 It may be recalled that two incidents of short-circuit had occurred at GGH, Kakinada in the last one month. In the first incident, fire engulfed the blood bank destroying several records and damaging the storage unit. In another incident, a fire damaged medicines worth Rs 13 lakh at the medicine supply centre.
 
 Even after repeated incidents of short-circuits, the authorities failed to install proper safety measures in the hospital with old electrical wires dangling all over the hospital.
