  :   leader and party in charge of the   Prakash Javadekar on Monday said the saffron party will fight for a "Congress-free" Manipur. 

 Javadekar, who is in the state to finalize party tickets, said the key issues BJP will take up in its fight are development of Manipur, "corruption-free Manipur, blockade-free Manipur, bandh-free Manipur and, therefore, Congress-free Manipur".
 
 The state has been under siege since November 1, when the   (UNC)-sponsored economic blockade of the national highways on the state began. The state has been reeling from the resultant crisis, the lack of supplies and essential commodities. People are having to shell out almost triple the normal rate for daily commodities.
 
 Holding chief minister   responsible for the deadlock, Javadekar said, "Elections come and go, but you cannot hold people hostage for electoral gain. Ibobi Singh has held the people of Manipur hostage. It is not only people who enforce the blockade but also those not taking any action against it that are responsible."
 
 The saffron party, aiming at bringing down the 15-year-long Congress regime in the state, has already demanded the chief minister's resignation for his "failure" to end the blockade despite required central forces being sent to the state by the Centre.
 
 The Ibobi Singh-led government has, in fact, managed to bring commodities into the state under heavy security cover along the Imphal-Dimapur and   routes once or twice in 10 days during the ongoing blockade.
 
 Javadekar said the Centre's hands are tied as far as using the forces is concerned because law and order is a state matter. Without the explicit permission of the chief minister, security forces cannot do anything on their own, the BJP leader added.
