NEW DELHI: Students from Classes IX to XII of   will have to attend a mandatory   and   class every day. 

 
 This is a qualifying subject for which grades will be offered and is mandatory for students to be eligible to appear for the Class X and XII  . According to new rules issued by the board, the schools will have a daily sports period for all classes. 
 
 The students will have to go to the playground during the sports period but will be free to perform any physical activity listed in the manual and will be graded on the same.
 
 According to a senior board official, the move is a step to prevent growing obesity among school children. The schools earlier used to have work experience and health education in the senior classes, which has now been replaced with a sports and health education class. “There has to be a period for this activity. 
 
 However, there will be no exams. Schools have the flexibility to decide what kind of activities they would like to introduce during this period,” the official said. The board had last month asked all schools to reserve one period for Health and Physical Education (HPE) while preparing the time-table for the 2018-19 session.
 
 However, Physical Education (PE) as an academic elective will be continued to be offered to Classes X and XII.
 
 The board has prepared a 150-page manual detailing sports guidelines and methodologies.
 
 “The process of HPE will be school-based and will be evaluated and implemented by school teachers only. The marks or grades will have to be submitted by schools on the   website,” the official added. While assessment will be mandatory to be eligible for appearing in Board exams, the marks will not be added to the final result.
 
 The schools will not have to have only PE teachers for conducting the period. Every teacher will be eligible for implementing, evaluating and record keeping of HPE which will be completely practical.
