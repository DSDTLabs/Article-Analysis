NEW DELHI: Are   trying to ride on Karnataka's 'dressing room luck'? Monday morning's scene at the   suggested something like that. When   players entered the stadium they found their dressing room for their last two games against Hyderabad (quarters) and   (semis) already occupied by the Saurashtra team.

 
 Sources told TOI that the Karnataka cricketers were told by the attendants that Saurashtra player wanted to know which dressing room Karnataka had been using in last two games and they promptly checked into that room.
 
 Karnataka players then insisted that it was their dressing room for the last two games and hence they would like to use the same for the final too. The attendants managed to persuade Saurashtra to vacate the room but not before the players insisted on keeping their bags in that room itself.
 
 Karnataka team officials refrained from commenting while Saurashtra officials were not available for comment.
