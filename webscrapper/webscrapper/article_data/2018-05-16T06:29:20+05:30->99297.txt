 Emphasising the “need to incorporate gender and age sensitivities”, the draft — applicable to all government and private facilities —specifies that the centres providing substance use disorder treatment and rehabilitation should plan services as per the requirements of women, children, senior citizens and transgenders. 
 
 The draft, which is under process, is likely to be sent by the health department soon for the approval of the health minister. It will also go to the lieutenant governor before the final notification is issued with the approval of Delhi State Mental Health Authority. 
 
 Prepared by a core committee of experts working on the issue of de-addiction, the draft focuses on human rights of the patients. It is sought that every patient’s details be recorded and each be given a unique identity. Every patient must be seen by the doctor daily during the stay and all centres must be linked to a hospital with a 24-hour emergency medical facilities. 
 
 The panel was constituted by the inter sectoral coordination committee chaired by chief secretary Anshu Prakash that was set up on the directions of the LG to look into the addiction problems. The minimum standards follow the high court’s directions in connection to a PIL.
 
 The centres should be classified based on the facilities they provide, such as acute care and detoxification, dual diagnosis (substance use disorders and psychiatric diagnosis), and long stay (for one month or more). The minimum standards will be reviewed once the rules under Mental Health Act 2017 are notified by the Centre to ensure synergy.
