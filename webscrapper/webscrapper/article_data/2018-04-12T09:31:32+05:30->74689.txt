BHUBANESWAR: Two sumptuous goals, a controversy involving the referee and a fleeting threat of comeback made for a compelling Super Cup duel. In the end,   accomplished their mission in businesslike manner, cruising into the semifinals with a 3-1 win over   at the   on Wednesday. Mohun Bagan will take on the winners of the Bengaluru FC versus Neroca FC clash on April 17.

 
 It wasn’t Mohun Bagan’s best performance of the season. Shankarlal Chakraborty’s side even endured a Lajong fightback, during which the game could have gone the other way. But Bagan looked more purposeful and pro-active in raising their game just when it was required to get the desired result.
 
 On a day when the imperious Dipanda Dicka went through a rare lean patch, Bagan flew on the wings of side-halves Sheikh Faiaz and Nikhil Kadam, who scored in a span of eight minutes to hand the team early ascendancy.
 
 Unfazed by the reversal, Lajong threatened to script another Pune City-like comeback, which had seen them overcome a 0-2 goal deficit in the quarterfinal.
 
 Lajong missed a penalty in the 26th minute as captain Samuel Lalmuanpuia’s shot was easily negotiated by Shilton Paul. Two minutes later, the Bagan custodian was helpless when an unmarked Abdoulaye Koffi reduced the margin.
