HYDERABAD: The   agreed to have 50% control over the traders who have more than `1.5 crore turnover and 90% control on those below `1.5 crore turnover after implementing the   (GST).

 After attending the finance ministers' meeting at New Delhi, state   spoke to media persons and said all states except West Bengal agreed to the formula on the control.
 
 He said the Centre will have 10 per cent control on the traders with less than `1.5 crore turnover and 50% on above `1.5 crore turnover. All states agreed to postpone the implementation of GST from April to July , 2017.
 
 “There was a consensus on a proposal not to tax on farm equipment and products used by the farmers. Similarly, we have also demanded that there should be no tax on the goods that are used by common people and have extensive consumption. We will sort out the remaining issues in the next meeting scheduled on February 18,“ said Etala Rajender.
 
 He pointed that Telangana being a service oriented economy , needs compensation for the loss of revenue after the implementation of the GST. He insisted that the compensation amount should be finalised before the formal launch of the scheme and also provide constitutional safeguards for the state so that the dispatches would depend on the whims and fancies of the Centre.
 
 Experts say when the Goods and Services Tax is implemented, it will subsume the service tax that is currently in place. Service sector would witness slowdown in growth as the current Service Tax rate will increase from 15% to 18%. At last meeting of GST Council, a binding solution to contentious issues of dual control on tax administration and cross empowerment proved to be elusive.
