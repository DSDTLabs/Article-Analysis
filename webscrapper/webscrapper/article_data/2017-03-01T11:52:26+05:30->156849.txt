GUWAHATI: The   on Monday issued a  , the state government, the   and   seeking a reply on the killing of Ratan Narzary by security forces during a counter-insurgency operation in Kokrajhar district in December last year. 

 Narzary's family had moved the court demanding a CBI probe into the matter. Security forces had killed Narzary claiming he was member of an NDFB (S) outfit. His family, however, said the allegations were false and that he was actually an innocent peasant with no links to any militant group.
 
 According to Narzary's family, a surrendered Bodo militant Jaikhlong Brahma took him from Bengtol market when he was shopping for Christmas. The next morning, he was shot dead in the Laopani area and branded as an NDFB (S) gunrunner.
 
 His brother Anil Narzary said Ratan, a father of three, was not associated with the militant outfit. "If my brother was a militant, why did the Army or police not arrest him earlier? He was living at his residence after all," he said.
 
 Representing the family in court, senior advocate Bijon Mahajan said the court had granted four weeks' time to the respondents to file their replies as to why investigation into the case should not be handed over to CBI.
 
 Mahajan said, "Since the operation was carried out by both state police and the Army, the family demanded a CBI or high court-monitored high level probe into the matter."
 
 The court has also asked police to preserve all evidence collected in the case so far.
 
 Earlier, Kokrajhar Police had told the media that Ratan was killed when he, along with three other NDFB (S) militants, was hiding in the Laopani area. Police said they fired upon the militants after the latter opened fire at the troops. An AK-56 rifle, along with ammunition, was also reportedly seized from his possession.
 
 After Ratan's death, there was huge public outcry, following which chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal had promised an enquiry.
