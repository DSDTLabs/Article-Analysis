MUMBAI: Although some of its employees, including the former branch head, are under suspension, for the remaining staff at  's   branch - which is at the heart of a Rs 11,300 crore fraud -it appeared to be business as usual on Friday.

 
 The branch, located in Mumbai's prime Fountain area, does not have the general hustle-bustle or queues of customers common to a PSU bank as it is designated as a mid-corporate branch that caters to businesses rather than individuals. As a result, even with a total employee strength of around 35, the branch office wore a desolate look on Friday.
 
 An official at the bank said that employees' anxiety levels were brought down on the day the scam broke, through comforting communications involving verbal and WhatsApp chats.
 
 "Some regular customers did walk in to check if all was well. Looking at our normal demeanour, people were reassured," said the employee.
 
 A customer withdrawing a substantial amount from his account at the branch said he did so because he genuinely required the money for some urgent work and not because the bank was in trouble.
