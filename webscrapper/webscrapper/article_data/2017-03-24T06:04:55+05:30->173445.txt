BENGALURU: Yediyur, one of the oldest lakes in south Bengaluru, has attracted scores of rare visitors this year —121 species of migratory birds to be precise. A bird sanctuary and a slew of other facilities have been put in place to provide safe shelter to the avian guests. A unique initiative termed Baanadi, Marali Baa Goodige (birds, come back to your nest), was launched at the lake on Thursday. In a novel initiative,   set up a biodiversity wall and tower within the lake premises.The wall and tower are designed in the shapes of nests and burrows to provide the birds a natural habitat.

 The Palike spent Rs 25 lakh for the purpose, said mayor G Padmavathi. The garden around the lake has been soundproofed and the birds are continuously being monitored.
 
 Ramesh N R, former corporator of Yediyur, said the structures have breeding space, which keeps the temperature uniform for the birds to incubate their eggs. “It also protects them from predators,“ he said.
 
 The number of migra tory birds has gone up this year; last time 70-80 birds had come visiting. Species like Pipers from Europe, Stints from   and Finland, Indian golden oriole from Afghanistan and Nepal are regular visitors to the city.
 
 Environmentalist   said: “The scientifically proven fact that migratory birds are attracted by the chirping of other birds was taken into consideration. We have installed waterproof speakers so that pleasing music is played during the day and the birds are not disturbed by high-decibel noise or radiations.“
 
 Sign boards asking walkers not to use mobile phones or electronic devices have been installed.As a safety measure, the authorities have relocated six telecom towers in the vicinity. To give the birds landing space, the area around the lake has been cleared.
