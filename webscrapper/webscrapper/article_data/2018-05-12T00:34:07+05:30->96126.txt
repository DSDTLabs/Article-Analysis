Trichy: R Babu, a heavy machinery driver with the Trichy Corporation, has won a bronze medal in the Asian Powerlifting Competition held in Udaipur, Rajasthan, last week. The 40-year-old powerlifter hailing from Woraiyur here was given a rousing welcome by corporation officials and workers on reaching Trichy.

 Organised by Powerlifting India, the event was held between May 1 and 6 at Udaipur with participation by more than 100 powerlifters from 14 countries including Afghanistan, Iran and Uzbekistan. 13 powerlifters from Tamil Nadu participated in the event under different age and weight categories. R Babu, represented the nation in the master 93kg category. 
 
 The competition was held in three segments - squat, bench press and deadlift. Babu clinched the gold medal in squat, silver in deadlift and bronze in bench press. He was awarded the overall bronze medal in the master 93 kg category placed after Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan powerlifters. 
 
 Babu who arrived was given a warm welcome by corporation staff for bringing laurels to the civic body. 
 
 “Colleagues were very supportive in carrying out the additional work in my absence while the senior officials were kind enough to permit me to participate in the week-long powerlifting competitions representing India,” Babu said.
 
 Though the corporation worker has clinched several medals and grabbed prizes in state and national powerlifting competitions since 1991, the Asian powerlifting contest held at Udaipur was his first international medal representing the nation. “Carrying forward the momentum, I have planned to practice more and improve my performance to represent India in the Commonwealth games,” Babu adds.
