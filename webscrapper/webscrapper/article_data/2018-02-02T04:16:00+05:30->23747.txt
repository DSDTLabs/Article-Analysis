Mumbai: Doctors and patients welcomed the Union government’s announcement that every tuberculosis patient would be given Rs 500 every month towards ration.

 “Nutritional support is important for a patient’s overall improvement,’’ said a doctor. BMC’s TB officer Dr Daksha Shah said that the ‘direct benefit transfer’ is a welcome step because it would help in adherence to treatment. At present, a percentage of patients drop out of treatment due to side-effects such as nausea and vomiting; nutritional support would help such patients continue with treatment. The BMC had a couple of years back tried offering ready-to-cook food packages, but it didn’t meet with wide success. It then started offering foodgrain. On Thursday, finance minister Arun Jaitley said that Rs 600 crore would be allocated for nutritional support to TB patients in India. The funds will be transferred directly to the patient’s account every month.
 
 The BMC has for the last two years been providing some nutritional support for drug-resistant TB patients. Ration in form of foodgrain was being provided to approximately 2,500 patients with multiple drug-resistant TB.
