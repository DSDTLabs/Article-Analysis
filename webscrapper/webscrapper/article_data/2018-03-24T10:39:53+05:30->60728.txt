MOHALI: The police on Friday arrested former   and two others on charges of smuggling opium. Former DSP Hakikat Rai Singh, Swaran Singh and   were caught with 15 kg opium, a .32 bore revolver and 18 rounds of live cartridges.

 A state task force (STF) team stopped a car bearing registration number HR-08-F-2900 being driven by Swaran Singh, a resident of Amloh, with the former DSP sitting on the front seat and Bikram behind near Tanna village on   road. The STF found the opium stacked under the seat in a pack. Police also recovered the revolver with 18 live cartridges from the former DSP. All of them were coming from Jharkhand.
 
 
 STF superintendent of police   said Bikram told them that he was 14 years old when he joined a dera in Punjab, whose chief was a habitual opium consumer. He was since then asked to get the drug for the dera chief. Later, after the death of the dera chief, Bikram came in contact with the former DSP and Swaran Singh, who were frequent visitors to the dera.
 
 Sohal said as many other inmates of the dera were also opium addicts, the three started to smuggle opium from Jharkhand, as it was cheaper, and sold them at higher rates in the dera.
 
 An FIR under different Sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic substances (NDPS) Act was registered against the four. A court on Friday sent them in police custody for two days.
