PANAJI: Ridiculing the   for its failure to restart mining operations in Goa, the state   said Prime Minister   ‘ignored’ the six-member delegation led by PWD minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikar as he was not concerned about Goa.

  “If BJP MLAs and ministers went to Delhi and met some staff in the PMO, it looks like the PM has no time to address the burning issues of the state of Goa,” said Goa Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson  . 
 
 The Congress went on to say that the BJP made no effort to bring mining stakeholders to one table to find a solution to restart mining. “The government does not have any solution to the mining issue,” he said. “But there has been a lot of talk, which is empty, hollow and senseless, without any action at their end.” 
 
 Naik pointed out that even four months after the   order not a single key BJP leader identified a viable solution to help mining-dependents.“After the first meeting with Union minister Piyush Goyal, the BJP did not disclose any solution,” Naik said. “When BJP national president Amit Shah addressed karyakartas, he too failed to disclose a solution. The chief minister, in the two videos he released, did not even touch upon the issue of mining.”
 
 The BJP’s failure to find a solution indicates that it is “an enemy of economic growth, progress” Naik said
