This incident took place in Parasia range while the other three incidents took place in   range — both fall in 15-20 km stretch,” said district forest officer (Chhindwara East) S S Uddey.
 
 “We have spotted pug marks of leopard. As of now, it cannot be said whether the same leopard has struck in all the incidents. Keeping in mind the targets and the method of attack, its seems to be the work of the same animal. We are searching for the leopard for the last one month.,” he said.
