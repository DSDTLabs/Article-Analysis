CHENNAI: The opening Senior Division league match between   and Income Tax was postponed here on Friday after   (CFA) failed to get the requisite permission from SDAT to use the   in time. When SDAT finally gave allowance, the teams surprisingly cited exhaustion and didn’t want to play.

 
 “There were some legal issues due to which we were not getting the permission. We approached the sports minister   and he helped in getting the permission at last. It was 6 pm then and SDAT said we can use the floodlights too to conduct the match. But the teams didn’t want to play because they were tired due to waiting. Now, the league will finally start on Sunday,” a top CFA official told TOI on Friday.
 
 No title sponsors: The league might have six corporate teams but CFA is struggling to find a title sponsor. The league though has two associate sponsors. “We have approached various corporates. But since it is March-end, they couldn’t budget anything at this point. We will have a title sponsor on board by April,” said the official.
 
 No extension for league: The Tamil Nadu Football Association (TFA) is unlikely to give any extension to CFA senior division league. “Our constitution states that the leagues should end by April 29. So we will follow it. CFA should have thought about this issue earlier,” said a TFA official. The teams had lodged a complaint that players will get less recovery time due to the delayed start of the league.
