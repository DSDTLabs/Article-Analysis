KOLKATA: Churches have received fresh coats of red and gold, aroma of meat cooked in broth is wafting out of the homes while youngsters are busy practising their dance moves — Chinese families in Kolkata are busy applying finishing touches to their New Year celebrations.

 This year, the festivities start on Thursday evening, when the Chinese community will bid farewell to the Year of the Rooster and welcome the Year of the Dog. “The festivities will kick off on Thursday night itself with a big carnival in Tangra. There will be a light show and fireworks, after which people will visit the temples to offer their prayers,” said AN Than, a member of the Indian Chinese Association.
 
 
 The congested and dilapidated neighbourhood of Chatawala Gali, Lu Hsien Sarani and   in central Kolkata are already in celebratory mode. The entire neighbourhood is wrapped in red and gold. Chinese eateries and churches have already been decorated with Chinese lamps and red paper.
  
  
 “The celebrations become more significant as the community has now dwindled to a few hundred families. But once upon a time, the community had a big presence in trade and commerce. In order to preserve our culture and language, we need to celebrate our festivals in a grand manner,” said  , a businessman selling footwear on Bentinck Street.
 
 One of the main traditions is to clean the house to get rid of all the bad luck.“After the New Year comes, we believe that we cannot sweep the home on first few days, otherwise all the new luck will sweep away. Many people also wrap up unfinished business,” said Li Han Kuang, secretary of the Toong On Church on Black Burn Lane.
 
 “Some families believe that knives and other sharp objects should be kept away because they might ward off the good luck,” said  , a member of the   in Damzen Lane. Many Chinese families have already finished preparing for the big day feast. Biryani may have sneaked into the Chinese menu but boiled dumplings are still a must.
