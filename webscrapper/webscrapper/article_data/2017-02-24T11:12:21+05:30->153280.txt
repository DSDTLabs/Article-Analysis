NEW DELHI: With the wicket of Australia’s Mitchell Starc off the fifth ball of the second morning in Pune, Ashwin claimed his 64th wicket of India’s busiest home season ever, in what is their 10th Test. This signaled the end of Australia’s first innings at 260, with Starc’s 60 having frustrated India and taken the tourists into the second day at Pune’s MCA Stadium. 

 In October 2016, when New Zealand came for three Tests, Ashwin took 27 wickets and backed that with Ashwin taking 28 wickets across five versus England. In the one-off Test against Bangladesh in Hyderabad this month, Ashwin took six more wickets. He so far has three in the ongoing Test in Pune, with three more to go against Australia. 
 
 During the 1979-80 home season, former India captain   had taken 63 wickets in 13 Tests. In six against Australia, he took 28 at an average of 22.32 and strike-rate of 47.8; next came six more against Pakistan, from which he claimed 32 at 17.68 and a strike-rate of 39.7; and lastly, in the Golden Jubilee Test, Kapil claimed three wickets.
