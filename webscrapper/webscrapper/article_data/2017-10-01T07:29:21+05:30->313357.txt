BENGALURU:   has crossed yet another milestone -a record 4.1 lakh passengers used the service on September 28, the highest ever ridership witnessed since the entire Phase I was made operational in June.

 While the festive season contributed to the rush, opening of Metro services till midnight to enable cricket buffs to reach home after the IndiaAustralia match also caused the number to swell. Purple Line (east-west corridor) saw a ridership of 2.37 lakh, and for Green Line (north-south corridor), the figure was 1.72 lakh. 
 
 U A  , chief public relations officer, BMRCL, tweeted: "Yet another milestone ridership. Thanks to people patronage."
 
 Many , however, sought more coaches to ease the heavy rush in trains. "Sir, speed up the process to add more coaches. Let citizens not pay for poor capacity plan ning. So far good job.#NammaMetro," tweeted by Sridhar DP. "It's high time to start a coach for ladies. I travel daily and I see lot of girls very uncomfortable in the crowd of men," said another user.
 
 "The operations wing will increase the frequency and extend service depending on the rush," said Vasanth Rao. How ever, new coaches will only arrive in the beginning of 2018, said a senior   official, on condition of anonymity .
 
 Additional coaches are the need of the hour as over 3.5 lakh people take the Metro every day on an average. Even on Wednesday , Metro recorded a total ridership of 3,68,906.
 
 Amid growing demand, commuters want BMRC to expedite construction of Metro extension lines and other phases. "There is a need to extend metro till   on priority . Rest of extension can take its own time! SilkBoard is becoming messier due to metro work," tweeted Deepak Kumar, a commuter.
