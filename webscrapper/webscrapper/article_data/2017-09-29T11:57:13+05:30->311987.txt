CHANDIGARH: Sticking to its stand, the Medical Council of India (MCI) will show no mercy to the three   (non-resident Indian) students who were admitted to the Sector-32   ( ) 32 last year without any entrance examination.

 A day after TOI reported that the council had asked the medical college to file a compliance report on the admission of the NRI candidates, the MCI monitoring committee reiterated its stand. “We have asked the college to discharge those students, as it’s mandatory to clear a common test for admission to any medical college. Even before NEET (National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test), all medical colleges had entrance test, and now NEET is must,” MCI monitoring committee chairman Dr   said.
 
 City-based NEET trainer  , who raised the issue, is surprised that it took the MCI a year after the admissions to act. “In May 2016, we had intimated them about states that were notifying to fill the NRI seats in the MBBS course based on Class-XII scores. At that stage, it would have had no retrospective effect,” he said.
 
 “The NEET 2016 notification said seats under 85% state quota in government medical colleges was to be filled through AIPMT, NEET, or a central state pre-medical test (if the state opts). If the GMCH authorities had some doubt, they should have clarified from MCI before taking in   based on the Class-XII board marks,” Goyal said. “NEET was introduced to favour merit over fraudulent practices of intake in the medical colleges.” 
 
 Last year, the medical college had conducted NEET for all students except some NRI candidates. Six NRI candidates were admitted without the entrance tests, based on their Class-XII results alone. However, the MCI objected to the intake of three students only. “There seems to be some misinterpretation by the MCI,” said a member of the faculty at the GMCH. “The college is sending the reply.”
