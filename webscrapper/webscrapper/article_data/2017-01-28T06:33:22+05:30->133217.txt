JAIPUR: More than 150 neurosurgeons from India and other countries as well learnt the new technique of surgery using 3D in microscopy here on Friday.

 A case of 14-year-old boy suffering from progressive severe headache was taken up during the workshop as part of 2nd International 3D Neuro Anatomy. In 3D technique surgery, experts demonstrated how it is helpful to use 3D technique in surgery of a person with tumour. The technique was demonstrated by conducting a cadaveric dissection.
 
 The workshop was held by   (JNU) institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre in Association with  .
 
 Dr  , chancellor of JNU, said, “Surgeries performed with unique 3D Microscope & 3D Endoscope techniques are more precise and accurate. In complicated surgeries, it will enhance chances of saving lives.”
 
 Neurosurgeons from USA, Spain, Belgium and Argentina will participated in the workshop. 
 
 The workshop is recognized and supported by the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies, European Association of Neurosurgical Societies, Asian Congress Neurological Surgeons and  .
 
 “This is the first time neurosurgeons got a hands-on experience of operating through 3D vision. This new technology has never been implemented in the field of neurosurgery in India before,” confirmed Dr.  , senior consultant neurosurgeon at Narayana Multispeciality Hospital, Jaipur. The 3D operating microscope is used for dissection and operating on the patient’s brain and nervous system.
