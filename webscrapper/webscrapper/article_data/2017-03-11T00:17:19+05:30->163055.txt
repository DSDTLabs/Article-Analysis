Hyderabad: Apprehensions that providing jobs to the kin of existing senior workmen on health grounds would disturb the employment chances of youth are baseless,   Collieries Company Limited told the Hyderabad high court on Friday. The objective of the voluntary retirement scheme is to help senior employees who work in extremely hazardous conditions in mines upto 400 m deep, he said.

 The company general manager A Ananda Rao said this in his counter to a public interest petition filed by K Satish Kumar, an unemployed person from Godavarikhani in Peddapalli district. The petition challenged the job scheme saying it was like giving jobs on hereditary lines instead of open competition mode.
 
 The GM said that the case of Singareni mine workers was different as they often contract cancers and other deadly illnesses. Giving their kin jobs when the seniors become incapable is just, he said. Since the launch of the scheme, 5,875 employees have opted for it.
 
 He also made it clear that the scheme does not come in the way of direct recruitment and about 2,500 people have been inducted directly in 18 categories of posts in 2015-16.
