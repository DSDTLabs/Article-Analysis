AGRA: A day after   Swatantra Dev Singh termed the   as the most corrupt one in the state, a visit to the regional transport office (RTO) on Thursday revealed that touts still call the shots here. Interaction with some of these   that one may be able to get a   at home for Rs 1,500 to Rs 15,000. 

 They were also willing to give a discount of Rs 500, if one opted for a permanent license. Applicants were promised licenses in a week’s time without having to go through the online test. The fee, though, may also vary depending on what the touts decide to charge from a particular visitor.
  
  “You will get your learner’s license within two-three days for Rs 1,700 while an extra amount of Rs 3,000 is charged for a permanent one,” explained a tout outside the RTO office. 
  The official charge for a learner’s license is Rs 350 to Rs 400. For a permanent license, one has to submit the learner’s license along with other identity proofs and a fee of Rs 1,000. In a bid to skip these steps, many applicants approach touts.
  
  A tout who was seen taking Rs 12,000 from an applicant said, “You have to go through a long process to get a license. I will only charge this much and get you one in 10 days.”
  
  Vijay Kumar, regional transport officer said, “We evicted some touts last year. But many have put up permanent stalls beside the department office. We have resorted to online procedure now and biometric devices will be installed in the office in order to stop touts from entering.”
