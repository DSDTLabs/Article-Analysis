HYDERABAD: A 23-year-old woman from Sangareddy, Telangana has sought to be rescued from her   (employer) in Saudi Arabia as he is allegedly being abusive, and that she is also being forced to work as a housemaid in different houses. Naseem Begum was sent to Saudi Arabia by an agent from Golconda who promised her employment in a supermarket. But on reaching Riyadh on June 13, 2017, she was received by an agent who made her work as a housemaid in five different houses so far. From Riyadh, she was taken to Hail.

 Naseema Begum's mother Afzal Bee, who learnt of her daughter's plight, approached the police with a complaint to take action against the agent who sent her to Saudi Arabia making false promises. However, according to MBT leader Amjedullah Khan, the mother had a bitter experience with the police. When she went to the Ramachandrapuram police to lodge a complaint, as her house comes under that police station limits in Cyberabad, she was directed to file a complaint in Golconda police station as the agent Md Adil is a resident of Golconda. The agent operates from Hyderabad and Mumbai.
 
 In Saudi Arabia, Naseema Begum is reportedly being forced to work for 15 hours everyday without even proper food and accommodation by the kafil. She has two sons, aged three years and one year, back in Hyderabad and she had to go to Saudi Arabia only because she was promised a salary of 1,000 Saudi Riyal per month (₹18,000). In a letter to external affairs minister  , Naseema Begum's mother said both sons have fallen ill. The kafil is demanding ₹3 lakh to send her daughter back to India and the agent is also refusing to bring her back. "Please rescue my daughter," she urged Sushma Swaraj. The kafil is demanding that either ₹3 lakh be repaid to him, the amount he paid to the agent, or that she be replaced with another housemaid.”
