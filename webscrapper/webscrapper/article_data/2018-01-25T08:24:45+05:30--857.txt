BHOPAL: It is not Karni Sena but   that is spearheading the campaign against Padmaavat in MP. And those at the forefront of the agitation are well-educated, affluent members of society. Their grouse is that films turn heroes and historical characters into caricatures.

 The president of   Rajput Samaj is Lt   (retd), and IIM-Indore graduate Ramveer Singh Sikarwar heads the organisation’s youth wing.
 
 After serving the Navy, Bhadoria founded a company that is into several businesses, including construction. When asked what the problem with the film is, he said, “It’s simple. Historical characters who are revered should not be portrayed in films in a ‘fictional’ manner. Giving a disclaimer that it’s a work of fiction isn’t enough. Sanjay Leela Bhansali will make money but what about Padmavati, who is regarded as a Goddess in Rajasthan?”
 
 Sikarwar, who worked with US Aid and was adviser to the MP health department before getting into the construction business, said: “Majority of us are professionals. We believe in non-violence... There is a Jauhar Kund in Chittorgarh, and temples to ‘Devi Padmavati’. Why should a film be made on her?”
 
 
 
 An unannounced ban isn’t going to stop fans from catching Padmaavat. Many Bhopalis are taking the next train or plane out to Delhi or simply driving across the border to UP to watch the movie. The long Republic Day weekend has come as a boon to the scores of people in MP who are determined to point out how bans are futile as a medieval tactic. Piyush Bhalothia, a mass communication student, said, “I have planned a weekend trip to Delhi with my friends so that we can watch the movie.”  , a businessman, saye he has planned a trip to Agra for his entire family over the weekend to catch Padmaavat.
