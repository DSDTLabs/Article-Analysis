AHMEDABAD: Prime Minister   who concluded his two-day Gujarat visit on Wednesday reportedly set a target of 150 of 182 assembly seats to chief minister  , deputy CM Nitin Patel and state BJP president Jitu Vaghani, at the first dinner with Gujarat MLAs, MPs and party office bearers on Tuesday night at the chief minister’s bungalow in Gandhinagar. Ahead of the crucial final phase of the election in UP and other four states, Modi was in a calm, light mood. Despite partymen’s expectations, he did not make a speech. He made it clear he had come to meet the state BJP team informally. 

 Sources close to the development said: “While informally meeting state BJP leaders at the dinner, he asked them to meet the final challenge of breaking the Congress record of 149 seats, by winning 150 seats in the coming assembly elections. He also said that BJP cannot afford to isolate any community and needs to reach out to all the communities. He hinted at reaching out to the Patidar and other communities.”
 
 “He also asked ministers, MLAs and MPs to reach out to the masses instead of sitting in Gandhinagar or Delhi. He said to focus on weak seats and work on resolving all possible grievances. He also asked the CM and deputy CM to complete all direct beneficiary scheme targets, key infrastructure projects, roads and other works as soon as possible,” a source added.
 
 Sources further claimed that, “Though he did not clearly say that will there be early elections, but he asked to plan more events where he can come which is a significant indication of possible early elections.”
 
 Modi also had separate meeting with the CM, deputy CM, former CM Anandiben Patel and other leaders on Wednesday, before leaving for Delhi.
