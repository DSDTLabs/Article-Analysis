 A bench of Justice   passed the order while disposing of two writ petitions filed by IT College. In its petitions, the college had sought directions for LU to allow the BEd students to take the examinations. The college had alleged that LU had approved the BEd course but was not permitting the students to appear in the semester examinations. Denying the charges, LU had stated that IT College had violated norms in BEd admissions.
 
 The court concluded that there were irregularities in the admission process, but said at this stage it was not proper to deprive the students of the studies. In its order, the court said: “The university shall permit the students to appear in the exam and the result will also be declared along with the rest of the students. The university shall issue degree and other documents as would be done with regard to the other regular students.” Issuing a warning to IT College, the court said its management will not take any admission in any course in future in violation of the directions of LU. It added that “in case there is any confusion regarding admission then the college would raise it at the initial stage without taking admission in any manner of the students who approach for admission of the examinations.”
