KOLKATA: Even before a single vote is cast in the panchayat polls, the 2018 panchayat poll has already scripted a record as the fate of 34.2% seats in the three-tier rural bodies have been decided without a contest. The ruling   is the only party which has been able to field candidates for all the rural body seats.

 
 
 Figures released by the   revealed that of the 48,650 gram panchayat seats in the state, Trinamool has already bagged 16,814. The fate of 3,059 panchayat samiti seats and 203 zilla parishad seats have also been decided without a contest.
 
  
  
 
 While uncontested victories in rural polls is nothing new in Bengal, the scale this time has eclipsed all previous records, sources said. Election analyst   argues only twice before, in 2003 and 2013, had the percentage of uncontested seats reached the double-digit mark. The figure was 11% (6,800 setas) In 2003, and 10.66% (6,274 seats) in 2013. “If you compare it with the 2013 figure, we are witnessing a three-fold jump this time. This is a record,” said Chakraborty.
 
 Amid the protracted legal battle, the SEC on Sunday indicated it will inform the Calcutta High Court that during the four-hour window to file nominations on Monday, 5,697 nominations were filed. “A total of 269 nominations for Zilla parishad were filed on the last day of nomination, while 1,337 nominations were filed for panchayat samitis and 4,097 for the gram panchayats. The argument that opposition could not file nominations does not hold ground,” said an SEC official.
 
 Meanwhile, election commissioner   has written to the state government, asking for details of security arrangement. The state has initiated talks with   and Telengana for getting police force for the election.
 
 The BJP is likely to file a petition on Monday, challenging the commission’s handling of the election process. Earlier the HC had asked the commission to hold a meeting with the stakeholders in a meaningful way. The BJP is likely to question the sincerity of the commission in trying to make it “meaningful”. “The commission will have to explain what they mean by a meaningful meeting. The meeting that they held was not meaningful,” said a BJP leader.
