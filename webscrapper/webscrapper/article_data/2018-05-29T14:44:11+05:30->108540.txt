MHOW: Hundreds of drivers were snared for 12   on Bheirughat between Indore and   road recently because of  . The tailbacks for two to three hours on the five kilometres stretch have now become a daily affair, thanks to its width. 

 “It was a worst nightmare. We were stuck in the traffic snarls for 12 hours and that too in a non-AC car. It became unbearable for us since temperature increased in the ghat section,” said a commuter.
 
 The jams occur only when a truck or any other heavy vehicle breaks down in the mid of the road. As the stretch is narrow, it becomes difficult for other vehicles to pass on it. Thereafter, a large number of vehicles start crawling on the road. Traffic cops arrive at the spot with crane to remove damaged vehicle, but in vain. They don’t get space to move forward due to jam, sources said. 
 
 The problem has become worse for ambulances that come from Khandwa, Sanawad, and   with patients since they have to reach Indore hospitals under emergency condition.
 
 Simrol police station sub-inspector   said, “The drivers of cars and   buses make three to four lines of vehicles before police or   members could reach the place. Then, it becomes very difficult even for police to remove the jam.”
 
 Police might not have any concrete solution to the problem affecting hundreds of people daily, but people having their shops in the area have one. “Every time crane is not needed to remove heavy vehicles that break down in between the road. They can be put aside with the help of tractors too. Tractors could reach the place immediately since farmers having their land on the roadside can provide them as soon as possible,” said a fruit vendor Ramdin Yadav, who has opened his makeshift shop in the area.
