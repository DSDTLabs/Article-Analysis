Margao: Desilting work of the popular Dambab talli (Damodar lake) opposite the Damodar temple in Fatorda began on Saturday.  Speaking at the launch, agriculture minister Vijai Sardesai told reporters that “The task of desilting the lake will be completed within a week, before the monsoon. It will be beautified and turned into a recreation spot, after consulting heritage lovers”. Sardesai said the BJP-led coalition government is drafting a special subsidy scheme titled ‘Farmers Forward’ for agriculturists in the state, which will be announced during the Krishi Mela (farmers’ meet), to be held on May 28, at Ravindra Bhavan, Margao.  “The scheme will provide subsidies to farmers for rice cultivation and transplantation. It will not support purchase of agricultural equipment, but encourage collective farming,” he said.
