VADODARA/MUMBAI: The  , which has exposed massive corruption in some state associations of the   ( ), threatens to stir a hornet's nest in Indian cricket.

 Amongst its many damning findings, the report, commissioned by the BCCI under its `project transformation' in November 2015 when current   chairman   was its president, highlights how the   ( ) distributed silver coins worth Rs 96 lakhs to all its 2,300 members last year.
 
 While they did accept that the silver coins were indeed distributed, all the current and former BCA officials, who were in the association and were thus responsible for taking the decision, shifted the blame to the other party .
 
 “The BCA took the decision after I was thrown out of the association. Anshuman Gaekwad was the secretary that time. When I was the secretary , the idea was discussed but it was abandoned after a private consultant advised against it. It was a wrong move to distribute coins,“ former BCCI and BCA secretary , Sanjay Patel told TOI.
 
 Gaekwad, on the other hand, said that the decision was taken by the previous committee (when Patel was the secretary and former IPL chairman Chirayu Amin was the president) in 2012, and his panel only executed it. “No one raised any issue when the coins were distributed,“ added the former India batsman. The coins, worth around Rs 4,000, were distributed to the BCA members to commemorate 75 years of the association's existence and the centenary year of legendary India batsman Vijay Hazare.
 
 “The decision to distribute silver coins to all the BCA members was passed by the managing committee unanimously in 2015 when Samarjitsinh Gaekwad was the president, Anshuman Gaekwad was elected secretary and Snehal Parikh was the secretary in-charge. There was no objection to the decision by anyone in the managing committee that time. We also produced relevant documents to Deloitte during the audit,“ said BCA treasurer Amul Jikar.
