JAIPUR: Members of the state  , including the parliamentarians and state cabinet ministers, will observe a day-long fast on Thursday to protest against disruptions allegedly caused by the   in Parliament. 

 Senior leaders from the state, including the MPs and ministers, would be joining the party workers in their fasts at all the 33 districts of the state. “For us, the Parliament is the temple of democracy. However, Congress has been causing disruptions and not allowing it to function properly; even during the budget session. We, along with PM  , party president Amit Shah and other senior leaders will observe a day-long fast to protest that,’’ said state BJP president Ashok Parnami. 
 
 Parnami was interacting with the media after a meeting with the cabinet ministers at the state party headquarters, which was presided over by chief minister Vasundhara Raje. Parnami said that it was a routine meeting, which is done every week to gather the feedback from the ministers, who had travelled to the districts they are in-charge of. “Many things are discussed in the meetings with the aim of strengthening the organisation and the government,’’ he said.
 
 Meanwhile, state home minister   too addressed a press conference at the state BJP headquarters. Listing out the good work of the ruling party, he said, “In 2014, the cleanliness ratio in the country was just 40 per cent but now it has been raised to 80%. We have achieved more cleanliness in the last four years than Congress did in the last 67 years. In the last three years, in more than 350 districts have been declared open defecation free,” said Kataria.
