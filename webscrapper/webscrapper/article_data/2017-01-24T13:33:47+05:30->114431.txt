With almost every show of the film   across   running to packed houses, the film is expect ed to easily cross Rs 10 crore gross collections at the box office in the first week itself. This will propel lead actor  , who also wrote the film's script, to the list of top actors in Kannada.

 The film was released in only 115 screens (40 multiplexes and 75 single screens) but the box office collection has more than surprised everyone.
 
 The film's distributor   said, 'I did not want to risk releasing the film in 200-300 screens. But seeing the collection reports from across the state, I can say with confidence that the film will easily gross between Rs 10-12 crore in the first week. The share for the producer would be at least `7-8 crore.' In some multiplexes, Kirik Party has replaced Aamir Khan's Dangal.
 
 Almost every multiplex has increased the number of shows for the film on the second day of release itself. The film was expected to do well in urban centres. But surprisingly, it clocked housefull shows on Saturday Ra and Sunday even in all the mofussil centres that the film was released in.
 
 Only films of six current stars has grossed over Rs 20 crore at the box office. Even with the dip in collections that is seen in the second week, Kirik Party is set to join that league, propelling Rakshit to that list.
 
 Several factors could have helped the film. The film had created huge expectations after its trailer went viral.
 
 Since Mungaru Male, 10 years ago, films released in the last week of December have almost always gone on to become big hits. 'This film is a message to our stars and the industry. The film did not have a choreographer, fight master, dancers or top artistes. Except for Rakshit and   there was no known face,' says a producer.
