NEW DELHI: A Mughal era embankment with related structures, having remained hidden from view at the Talkatora Garden all this while, will get a new lease of life. Its conservation is being taken up jointly by Delhi government’s department of archaeology and Intach Delhi chapter.

  The surviving structures of the embankment (bund) at the NDMC-run park have been described as two bastions, or chhatris at the western end, and the central baradari (pavilion).

When more area was cleaned of the shrubbery, new elements such as walls of a pavilion and arches and other remnants were exposed.

It is made of the thin, flat, kiln-baked Lakhori bricks and stone masonry, revealing its distinct Mughal roots. An Intach official said, “This is a fascinating, artificially created dam and storage tank, and it should be revived.”
 
  According to historians, this is also the site where the Marathas defeated the Mughals in 1738. The place was used as a camping ground by the Maratha army in 1736-37. Saadat Khan, a Mughal army officer, having attacked a contingent of the Maratha army after it crossed the Yamuna, retired to Mathura thinking he had defeated the enemy. Peshwa Baji Rao had, however, taken another route to reach Delhi and camped at the  .
