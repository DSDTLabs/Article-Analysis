INDORE: The local health department on Thursday issued notices to allopathic hospitals asking them not to appoint   doctors as it can result in cancellation of the licence.

 “As per the law, no allopathic hospital is allowed to appoint doctor, who is not graduated in modern medicine. We have issued notices to around 252 hospitals asking them to follow the law. In case of any violation, their licence will be cancelled under Nursing Home Act,” chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr HN Nayak told TOI.
 
  
  
 To ensure implementation of the law, the health department can carry out inspection anytime, Nayak said.
 
 The action came in backdrop of allegations against city-based allopathic hospitals for appointing non-MBBS practitioners, who are rendering services from general wards to   (ICU).
 
 “Many allopathic hospitals in the city are flouting rules by appointing non-MBBS doctors and assigning them major responsibilities. By this, not only allopathic doctors are suffering, hospitals are compromising with the health of patients,” IMA’s state-body president, Dr   told TOI.
 
 He said that IMA state and national body, who has been protesting against the proposed   ( )   that allows AYUSH doctors to practice modern medicines after completing a bridge course, is also against such practice at allopathic hospitals.
 
 Government grants licence to these medical facilities, collects taxes and monitor its functioning, so the authority should be made responsible for non-MBBS doctors serving there.
 
 “We will ask our member doctors, who own these hospitals, not to appoint AYUSH graduates as these facilities have been given licence for offering treatment in modern medicines,” Dr Sharda said.
 
 He added that it’s a responsibility of local health department to carry out a survey of private allopathic hospitals and take appropriate action if non-MBBS doctors are found serving there.
