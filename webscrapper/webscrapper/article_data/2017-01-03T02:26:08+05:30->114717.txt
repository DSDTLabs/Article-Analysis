NEW DELHI: The   is finding it an uphill task to embrace  . With just six months left for the deadline to digitise all property records to get over, only 35% of the work has been completed.

 An additional commissioner, who didn’t want to be named, said the pace of the work suggested that the wait for a more transparent and efficient property tax collection process could be longer than expected.
 
 North corporation spokesperson   said the volume of the work was huge. “We need to bring over 10 lakh property records on to the digital map. Each record involves extensive data and requires careful handling,” he said. The project was assigned to a contractor who was working on the project, he said.
 
 So far, around 3 lakh property records have been digitised. The 1,000-odd corporation properties were digitised on priority before the agency moved to bring private properties on to the platform. “The properties are spread over 104 wards. So far, 34 wards have been covered,” Maan said.
 
 Once the digitisation process is completed, it is expected to tighten the noose around defaulters. It is also expected to result in higher revenue for the civic body. “Just 10% of people pay property tax in Delhi. The exercise was started in 2015 and the progress hasn’t been up to expectations,” said former mayor Ravindra Gupta.
