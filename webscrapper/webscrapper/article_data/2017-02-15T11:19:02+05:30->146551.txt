CHANDIGARH: The claim commission appointed by the   government to estimate the damage caused during the Jat stir for reservation held in February 2016 has received 416 claims till date. This was stated on Tuesday by Haryana secretary (home) Suresh Kumar Goyal in response to a contempt of court petition on the issue.

 In its report, the home department submitted before the court that after holding press conferences at Rohtak, Sonipat, Jhajjar, Jind, Kaithal and Hisar and after issuing advertisements in various newspapers, the commission headed by Justice KC Puri has received 416 claims from individuals and public offices.
 
 It was also stated that all deputy commissioners and SPs of various districts had been asked to provide the existing videos, any other recordings or material to pinpoint the damage and to establish a nexus between the perpetrators of the violence and organizers of the event that led to such huge damage.
 
 The home department further informed the HC that notice on claim petitions received till December 30, 2016, had been sent to the parties concerned through the respective deputy commissioners. The matter is pending before the HC in the wake of a petition filed by the Anti-Corruption Federation of India.
 
 The petitioner argued that the state government had failed to perform its â€˜raj dharma' that sparked violence and arson, resulting in damage to property totalling Rs 50,000 crore. He alleged that despite categorical directions from the high court to recover damages from the agitators, who had destroyed public and private property in the violence held in 2010 in Mayyar near Hisar, government officers had not taken any action against the culprits.
 
 It was further stated that the state government's failure in acting against the culprits of the 2010 violent Jat reservation agitation resulted in the February 2016 violence, loot and destruction of properties by Jat protesters.
