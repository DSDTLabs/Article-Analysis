Panaji: Members of Goemkars Against   (Planning and Development Authorities) will go on a chain hunger strike starting May 9, as its demand for the government denotifying PDAs for all villages has not yet been met. The villagers said that town and country planning (TCP) minister Vijay Sardesai is only making statements and has not initiated the official process of denotification.

 “The minister remains adamant not to call a meeting of the TCP board and is silent on the memorandum submitted by villagers. Our letters to call us to discuss the matter has yielded no response,” Rudolf Fernandes of Goemkar Against PDAs said. They have been demanding that the government hold an emergency TCP board meeting and take a resolution to remove all PDAs.
 
 Goemkars Against PDAs had earlier given the government a one-week ultimatum to begin denotifying PDAs.
 
 Members of the group, led by convener Arturo D’Souza, will go on the hunger strike at Azad Maidan, Panaji. 
 
 The protesters’ demands include the scrapping of Regional Plan 2021, and amending the Town and Country Planning Act to empower panchayats to formulate their own plans.
