NAVI MUMBAI: Eight boys of a Karjat school for special children told police that the rape-accused caretaker used to physically abuse them. The accused used to also lock children in the hostel and the boys were given plastic bottles to urinate in the room. 

 The bail application of accused,  , who is in judicial custody, was heard at the sessions court in   on Thursday. "We opposed the bail. A court decision is expected next week," said   district government pleader, advocate Santosh Pawar.
 
 Karjat police inspector   said, "The eight have been harassed for long and the caretaker used to come to the boarding school intoxicated. Some years back, a student went missing but was rescued by police. The accused, being a relative of the school superintendent and headmistress, was protected. He used to beat up and abuse children at the hostel."
 
 Tanawade added, "The drunk caretaker used to lock the door and sleep. He had given students plastic bottles to urinate in the room and did not allow the boys to use the urinal."
 
 "The school superintendent and headmistress, though released on bail, will be charge-sheeted. It seems the duo did not rescue the students even after being informed about the atrocities. They could have taken action against the accused," the inspector added.
