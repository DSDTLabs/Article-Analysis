NAVI MUMBAI:   ( ), regional officer, Anil   has ordered closure of four processing units in Taloja industrial estate. These units have been held responsible for operating their plants despite orders of suspending work during the pipeline burst repair work (see box) that was underway last Friday. 

 These units released waste water whose chemical oxygen demand (COD) was 100 times higher than the ambient 5-6mg/l of river water.
 
 Mohekar has also asked   to inform the state pollution board about any pipeline burst, so that the apex regulatory body could take corrective action. 
 
 The toxic effluent released by four fish processing units in the broken pipeline was around 500 mg/l. 
 
 The toxic waste was supposed to be treated in the common effluent treatment plant (CETP) before being released in the creek. 
 
 But due to the pipe rupture, the effluents got discharged in the river. With very high level of COD, fish came up te surface to breathe due to lack of oxygen on Friday and was later found dead and floating on Saturday. 
 
 When the COD level is high in the effluents, the level of dissolved oxygen reduces in the water and fish and other aquatic life have to struggle to survive. According to the Taloja industry assoiation, around 50% of the 980 units in Taloja are chemical units.
