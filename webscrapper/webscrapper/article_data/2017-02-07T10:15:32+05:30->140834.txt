HYDERABAD: Lambs are all set to make a dent in the state exchequer, with the government planning to spend '2,600 crore to purchase over   from other states. The move is aimed at meeting the increasing demand for mutton (sheep meat) in the state as well as boosting rural employment and   .

 Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has asked officials to ensure purchase of lambs, which will them be distributed either free or at 75% subsidy among the shepherd community in the state. The state is also planning to spend an additional '500 crore for fodder, medicines and maintenance of health of these animals.
 
 Sources said KCR was concerned about the large number of families that have been involved in rearing and selling of sheep and goat for generations. “Such a step will spur economic activity, provide employment and ultimately increase meat production too,“ said animal husbandry special chief secretary Suresh Chanda.
 
 Animal husbandry department officials have conducted studies and identified 2 lakh eligible beneficiaries from the Golla, Kurma and Yadava communities, which comprise 7.5 lakh families in the state.Each beneficiary will be given one unit of sheep.
 
 “We need 2 lakh units of breeding sheep. Each unit comprises 20 ewes and one male. The idea behind purchasing the lambs from other states is to ensure multiplication of the sheep population in Telangana,“ animal husbandry director D Venkateshwarlu told TOI.
 
 “Youth in shepherding families have  , but are sitting idle due to shortage of sheep and goat. Nearly 6,000 lambs and sheep are currently being imported every day in   alone for slaughter,“ officials said.
 
 Dr V Ashok Kumar, assistant director, animal husbandry, said the average income expected from one breeding unit of sheep is Rs 14,800 per month. Each ewe gives three crops in two years, which means 18 lambs can be expected from one unit in eight months with the conception rate being at 90%.
