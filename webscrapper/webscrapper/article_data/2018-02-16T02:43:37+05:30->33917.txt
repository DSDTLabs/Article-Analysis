GURUGRAM: The   ( ) directed MCG to make EcoGreen — a private firm hired by the civic body — a party to a petition Vivek Kamboj vs. Union of India and other demanding the reallocation of   waste treatment plant and landfill from the Aravalis. 

 Reportedly, the announcement was made after the counsel of MCG couldn’t inform the tribunal on the steps taken for bio-mining at the waste treatment plant. “Learned counsel appearing on behalf of municipal corporation submits that he is not in a position to inform the tribunal as to what steps have been taken regarding bio-mining. He submits that project proponent M/S Eco   Pvt. Ltd. has to use RDF produced from the accumulated waste for energy generation. Let M/S Eco Green Energy Pvt. Ltd. be made party to the present application. Necessary amendment shall be carried out forthwith,” stated the court order. In July 2017, CPCB had released a set of recommendations following an inspection at the waste treatment plant. One of the recommendations was bio-mining of the waste. The report focussed upon the deteriorating situation at the landfill site. The board also informed that the groundwater in Bandhwari and Mangar were unfit for drinking due to pollution. TNN
