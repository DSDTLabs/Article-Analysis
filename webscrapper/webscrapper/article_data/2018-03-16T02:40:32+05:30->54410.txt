Navi Mumbai: The second key accused proprietor of Tirumala Properties has been arrested on Wednesday for cheating a Vashi-based builder in 2012. The officials from the Economic Offences Wing (unit 1) have identified the accused as Devdatta More. 

 More had identified himself as a police constable when the other accused had gone to strike the deal with the   builder. More, along with his other two partners, had sold a 350 acres land worth Rs 300 crore in Wahal village, Panvel taluka, to the builder. They had accepted Rs 5 crore as token amount in 2012. But the trio had allegedly forged the land documents. When the builder learnt about this, he informed the cops but by then they had already gone absconding, a police official said.
 
 Senior inspector   of the EOW unit-1 said, “ We have arrested the second accused More from Pune. The EOW team, led by former inspector  , had arrested the first accused   in July 2017. The other accused Avinash Deshmukh is still at large.”
