Manoj Nandam, who endeared himself to Telugu audiences as a child artiste in blockbusters like 'Chatrapathi' and 'Athadu', subsequently turned mainstream hero and met with modest success. The young actor is all set to turn a new leaf in his career playing a “terrifying villain” in an upcoming film directed by   (of ' ' and ' ' fame).
“When Manoj approached Sai Kiran Adivi for a possible collaboration, he was utterly taken aback when the director asked him to portray a negative role. The young hero was not convinced and neither was the unit of the film. But the director did a screen test and was convinced that Manoj was the right choice for the role. He shot for 18 days for the first schedule of the film recently at Lambasingi, in the interior part of Araku valley,” said a source, close to the unit of the film. He further adds, “It’s a completely unique genre known as OGF, an action rom-com. Sasha Chettri (famous for her 4G ad for a leading mobile network service provider) and   are essaying the female leads in the film.”
