Nagpur: A full-grown male sloth bear died of drowning in Bhusari Tola village in Sadak-Arjuni forest range under Gondia division. The sloth bear is suspected to have fallen in an open well in a farm owned by Soma Karuji Sonwane on Sunday night. The forest officials were informed about 24 hours later.  This is the latest case in the series of cases in the Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) corridor that is losing rich wildlife owing to multiple reasons like electrocution, poaching and falling of wild animals in open wells. On February 13, a sloth bear was electrocuted and all its body parts were removed in Tilli Mohgaon in Goregaon range of Gondia. Three persons were arrested in the case. Talking to TOI, GS Rathod, range forest officer (RFO) of Sadak Arjuni, said poaching is ruled out as all the body parts are intact. “The farm is close to forest and falls in the Navegaon-Nagzira corridor. We have identified some 100-150 open wells in the Sadak Arjuni forest range, which are vulnerable to wild animals. Funds have been sought to cover these wells under MREGS and some wildlife schemes,” Rathod said.  The carcass was later burned in the farm in presence of forest staff and Gondia district honorary wildlife warden Sawan Bahekar. Bahekar said despite huge loss of wildlife, majority of wells lack safety walls and hence building these walls is viable alternative but district administration and zilla parishad have never given priority to this. “It will not only help save leopards and other wildlife from falling into the wells, but will also save the forest department from putting efforts and spending huge money on rescue operations,” said Bahekar.
