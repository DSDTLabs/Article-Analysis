Thane: The changed political equations in the city following the reorganization of   seems to have forced political parties to rework their respective strategies resulting in dropping off a few sitting corporators. 

 Several sitting corporators across parties have been reportedly been dropped from the final list of candidates to contest the forthcoming elections while in some cases their nearest kin have been accommodated.
 
 The list of sitting corporators who were left in the lurch include Suhasini Lokhande from the BJP, mayor Sanjay More from the Shiv Sena along with party colleagues Pooja Wagh, Mahesh Wagh. Sajid Ansari from the NCP has also been   a ticket. 
 
 However, while parties have dropped these names from their lists, they have ensured to present someone from their immediate family to file the seat. 
 
 While Sukhada, the Mayor’s wife has been given a ticket to contest from 18C ward, a member from Wagh family has been given a ticket to field the 16B ward by the Sena.
 
 “I had already conveyed my decision to not contest the elections this time. The party has not kept me out, but it was my decision to stay away. My wife has been given a ticket on my behalf,” said More.
 
 However, there have been exceptions wherein names have been completely dropped off the list like in the instances of sitting corporator from 37A Namrata Bhosale who had to forego her seat while another sitting Sena corporator from 35A ward, Ashwini Jagtap, was also believed to have denied a ticket and filed her nomination as an independent. 
 
 “The trend of leaving out a candidate is because parties either had to rework their respective strategies after the four panel system was introduced or had a better opportunity in store for the sitting corporator,” said a poll analyst.
