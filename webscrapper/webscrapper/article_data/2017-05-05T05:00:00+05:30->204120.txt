A mid-week concert at a cafe in   was dedicated to one classical raag — the romantic and the ecstatic Yaman. Although the raag finds itself cutting across traditions of Hindustani  , including Bhajan, Ghazal, Geet and Sufi, the raag still remains true to the emotion of love, be it in a conversation between lovers or a conversation between a man and God. That’s exactly what the performers at the concert, titled ‘Swar Sadhana in Raag Yaman’, led by Ghazal singer  , showcased. “You will hear the same raag blend itself into all these genres. Listen for yourself, how all these great composers have set songs in this raag while each song still remains so distinct — from notes to mood. By the end of the evening, you will go away with this raag filling your heart with romance and ecstacy,” said Devi Ramana Murthy. 
The show that began with a Ganesha vandanam, went to bhajans like Sri Ramachandra Kripalu Bhajamana to ghazals and geets like Anjuman Anjuman Shanasai and Aaj Jaane Ki Zid Na Karo. The night ended with Bollywood classics like Woh Shaam Kuch Ajeeb Thi, and the mandatory, Dama Dam Mast Qalandar.
