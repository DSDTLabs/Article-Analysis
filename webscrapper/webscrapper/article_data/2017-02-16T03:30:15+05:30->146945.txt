NOIDA: The contractual   in the city have threatened to go on strike once again. Following a meeting with   officials on Wednesday, safai karamchari leaders reinforced their demand for removal of middlemen besides a host of other issues. Last year in July and again in December, sanitation workers had struck work and stopped cleaning the city and collecting municipal waste. They had instead littered the city with garbage to press for their demands.

 The threat came after sanitation workers felt let down by the Noida Authority after the latter initiated tenders to hire three private agencies to clean the city. These agencies, once appointed, will be responsible for hiring the safai karamcharis on contract to collect, transport and dispose the municipal solid waste from the city. “We have been demanding that we be made permanent employees of Noida Authority,” said Shiv Kumar, a member of the Rashtriya Safai Mazdoor Congress. “We also want the authority to pay us salary directly into our bank accounts because the private contractor charges 2.5 percent commission on our salary. We also demand that permanent jobs be given to those who have been working for more than 10 years,” he explained.
 
 Workers said that they had decided to come back to work the last time on assurances from the Authority officials that their demands would be addressed. “This time we will not relent and will go on an indefinite strike if this tender is not withdrawn,” Kumar threatened. “We have on Wednesday met the DCEO Saumya Srivastava and apprised him of our intention if they do not pay heed to our demands,” he said.
