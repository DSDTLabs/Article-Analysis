INDORE: Be prepared to shell out more for milk and dairy products from Wednesday. With the increase in milk prices by Rs 2, prices of related byproducts including paneer, mawa, cheese and curd will also go up making a big hole in the pockets of service class. 

 According to milk distributor unions, milk prices have been increased due to shortage in production and higher cost of cattle fodder. The union also expected that consumers may have to face a second round of price rise in summers when production of milk drops significantly and the city has to depend on other states. 
 
 Sobhana Garg, a government school teacher, said, “This was not at all expected at this time of the year. The hike in milk prices is very steep and will disturb the household budget completely.”
 
 The production of milk in Indore is about 14 lakh litre per day which is mainly supplied by 1.5 lakh rural households engaged into cattle rearing and dairy farming. In the city, milk is also supplied from nearby areas such as Sanawad and Dhar among others. 
 
 The price hike has come in the middle of wedding season when the consumption of milk and its byproducts increases. 
 
 Rohini Verma, a housewife said, “I have a family wedding in February. The hike in milk prices will now be an additional burden on us as for making sweets huge quantity of milk is required.”
 
 In Indore, about 2 lakh litre of milk is supplied to various hotels and sweet shops per day. 
 
 “With milk prices, the cost of sweets and milk related items is also expected to go up. Sweet shops and hotels may pass on the rise of increased milk prices to customers,” said   president Bharat Mathurawala. 
 
 Mathurawala said that farmers who were bearing losses since past many months will now be benefitted out of the price rise and this will help in increasing the milk output in the region.
