 The tanker truck operators participate in the tender and quote their rates for supplying water. “It is intended to get the water and the lowest rates. They foot the bill to the local body,“ said a representative of the Ernakulam district drinking water tankers' welfare association.
 
 The tanker trucks stop at particular points identified at the municipality or panchayats. “People will have to collect water from these points,“ he added.
 
 Long queues of people waiting for water have become a regular sight at rural areas of the district as well as in west Kochi regions. It is pointed out that when there is increased demand, the supply goes down resulting in public protests and arguments between people in the local communities.
 
 “The local bodies would benefit from tender only if multiple tanker operators participate in it. For example, it would be possible to get quotes as low as Rs 1,000 or Rs 900 for a water truck of normal size. Sometimes there would be only one participant and the price quoted would be between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000,“ said the representative of Ernakulam district drinking water tankers' welfare association.
