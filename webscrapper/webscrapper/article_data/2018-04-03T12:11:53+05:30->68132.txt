THRISSUR: The railways will soon introduce an app, which will enable   passengers in the state to buy tickets on their mobiles, eliminating the need for waiting in queues in railway stations. 

 The system was introduced in Chennai earlier, now it will be extended to all areas under the Southern Railway, before April-end.
 
 Railway sources said the system will be particularly useful for short distance commuters. 
 
 The app will not work within a radius of 15m from the station. Beyond that up to a point of 5km a passenger can book the ticket. 
 
 “They will not be able to buy tickets from the station or inside the  . It is to prevent ticketless passengers from buying tickets when they spot TTEs,’’ a railway official said. 
 
 Just like other unreserved tickets, tickets taken on the app will also have a validity of three hours from the time of booking for a distance of up to 200km. Tickets beyond 200km will have validity for one day, the sources said.
 
 The passengers will get a message on their mobiles when they book the ticket, with a scroll attached to it. However, the message cannot be forwarded to other mobiles, the official said.
 
 The officials have already tested the “mobile fences’’ to be put in place to prevent misuses. The commercial wing of the railways has given a report approving the introduction of the mobile ticketing under the Southern Railway.
 
 Initially, when the system was introduced in Chennai, the passengers had to take a print-out at the designated points at the railway stations, which was leading to queues. The latest modification allows for issuance of paperless tickets, the sources said.
 
 The sources said the railway was not planning to fix a cap on the number of unreserved tickets issued on a particular day. 
 
 “If any particular train is overcrowded, the passengers can opt for another train. But there will not be a ceiling on the number of current tickets issued,’’ an official clarified.
