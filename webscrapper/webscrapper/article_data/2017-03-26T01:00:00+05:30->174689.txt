Trust   to look ethereal in everything Indian. Few would know that although she’s seen flaunting ‘nosey’ accessories, she doesn’t quite have a piercing. The actress, who has been wearing nose-clips for the promotional activities of her next, ' ' — in which she plays the head of a brothel — could never get her   pierced when she was younger and now, she prefers to settle for clips instead of the real deal! 

  At the recent Times of India Sports Awards 2017, Vidya told BT, “I love nose clips, but I’m very scared when I wear them. I’ve had a chance to adorn so many of those beautiful ones lately, thanks to these promotions. They also go well with my character in the film. But personally, I wish I had done something about my nose when I was younger. Now, when I wear these clips, I’m a bit wary. I don’t want them to come off in the middle of an interview or a stage event if I sneeze or laugh! I always do a double check before leaving my room. 
 
  Nose pins and clips add another layer of elegance to a woman’s face. And everyone must give it a shot.”
