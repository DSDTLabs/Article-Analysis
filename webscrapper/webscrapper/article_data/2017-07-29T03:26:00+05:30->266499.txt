Mapusa: Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC) on Friday decided to approach the government for the construction of the beef market in Mapusa. After the demolition of the old beef and pork meat market structure which was declared unsafe, traders have been operating from a temporary structure set up next to the fish market.  The beef and pork stall owners had refused to shift to the new premises within the fish and meat complex, claiming that it was not possible to run the stall from the first floor as huge loads of meat would need to be transported every day. The council during its meeting on Friday approved, in principle, the reconstruction of the beef and pork market.The proposal will be sent to the North Goa Planning and Development Authority (NGPDA). The council resolved to undertake upgradation of sanitation facility and painting work at the Mapusa fish and meat market. Chairperson Rohan Kavlekar informed the council that during the previous meeting, the council had accepted the proposal of a Gurgaon-based company to set up a waste treatment plant at Assagao site and asked to present an MoU before the council but due to objection from the comunidade of Assagao the council had to drop the proposal and is now proposing to take up the same project at Cunchelim which has been acquired by the council.
