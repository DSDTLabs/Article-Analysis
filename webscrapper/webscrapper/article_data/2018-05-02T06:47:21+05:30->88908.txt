AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Tuesday granted further police remand till May 5 for Amreli  ,  , in connection with the   extortion case. Patel was produced before the court after a week-long custodial interrogation by the   (crime).

 
 Patel was arrested last month for his suspected involvement in abduction and illegal detention of Surat-based builder  . His subordinates allegedly extorted and transferred 200 bitcoins from Bhatt’s business partner’s digital wallet, and demanded Rs 32 crore more for his release.
 
 The probe agency wanted more time to interrogate him further on various aspects of the alleged crime including the trail of Rs 1.32 crore that allegedly transferred hands of the cops. 
 
 Patel’s advocate vehemently opposed the demand and claimed that the investigators had questioned about everything during the remand. 
 
 He also submitted that seven policemen had gone to the CID (crime) to surrender, but the probe agency refused to take their custody. 
 
 This led to heated arguments between lawyers in courtroom.
