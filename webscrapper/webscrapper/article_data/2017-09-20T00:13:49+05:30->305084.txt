MUMBAI: The   has imposed legal costs of Rs 20,000 and Rs 10,000 on a man and his estranged wife respectively over the quashing of a dowry complaint. 

 A division bench of Justice Rajendra Savant and Justice Sandeep Shinde was hearing a petition filed by the Kandivli resident and his parents seeking that the dowry harassment case be dropped as he had reached a settlement with his wife. The bench has in other cases imposed costs in settlement matters as the   and court machinery was used to settle private disputes. While earlier the courts have imposed such costs on the husband, in this case the wife was also asked to pay a fine. The judges said that the couple should deposit the money with the National Association of Blind, Worli. “In the light of consent terms coupled with the wife’s affidavit and having regard to the law laid down by the SC there is no impediment in quashing the proceedings in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties,” said the judges.
 
 The husband informed the court that he had agreed to grant divorce to his wife and she in return had undertaken to withdraw all the criminal proceedings that she had initiated against him and his family. The woman had lodged an FIR in 2013 at the Kandivli police station accusing her husband and her in-laws of harassing her for dowry (IPC Section 498A), assaulting her and also charged them with criminal intimidation. In 2016, she filed a petition before the Bandra family court seeking divorce on grounds of cruelty. The court referred the couple to a marriage counsellor and in June they agreed to settle their disputes. The couple agreed to obtain divorce by mutual consent under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act.
