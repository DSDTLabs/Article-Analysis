CHANDIGARH: In yet another incident of  , two sharpshooters shot dead an undertrial in the   complex on Wednesday. 

 The assailants struck when the policemen were escorting former sarpanch Rajiv Kumar aka Kala out of the court after a hearing in a double murder case.
 
 Following Rajiv’s defeat in panchayat polls in Aasauda village of Mandothi panchayat, Rajiv and his gang had killed the new sarpanch   and his father Balbir Singh at their house last year.
 
 Kartar Singh, a gangster and Rajiv aka Kala were arch rivals. With some members of the Kartar gang lodged in Jhajjar jail, Rajiv alias Kala was confined in Ambala Jail for security reasons, and was brought to Jhajjar only for the trial.
 
 Police said that around 12.30pm, when the assigned cops were taking Rajiv towards the vehicle, two shooters of Kartar gang — Rohit Kumar of Najafgarh and Sikandar of Brahmaula village of New Delhi — opened fire on him.
 
 Hit by a bullet in his back, a profusely bleeding Kala was rushed to Jhajjar civil hospital and then referred to PGIMS Rohtak where he was declared brought dead. His body was sent to Jhajjar civil hospital for postmortem examination. Police said Rohit and Sikandar tried to make a getaway after targeting Rajiv, but were nabbed by cops deployed at the court complex and handed over to   cops.
 
 Assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Shashank Kumar Sawan said they are trying to ascertain the motive for the murder or if more people are involved in the conspiracy.
 
 Jhajjar SP B Satheesh Balan too did not rule out the rivalry angle. ``Rajiv was involved in three cases of murder, three cases of attempt to murder and extortion. Since this prima facie appears to be an outcome of rivalry, we have made additional deployment of of police in Aasuda and Mandothi village,’’ said Jhajjar SP B Satheesh Balan.
