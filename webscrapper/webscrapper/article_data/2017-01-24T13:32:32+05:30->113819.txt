The norm in the Kannada film industry is to erect a set on one of the film studios in the city. But the makers of   ' produced by Sukruth Devendra, Deepak Krishna and   ' did things a little differently, much to the surprise of lead actor  , who was impressed that a   set, spread over four acres of land near  , was erected in a month's time.

 'I liked the story and the enthusiasm of the team. I had other commitments, such as my TV show and another film, and things were such that if they hadn't erected the jail set ' in which 80% of the movie is shot ' in a short span of time, they would have to wait eight months to secure my dates. I thought that it was impossible to achieve it in one month, since I knew that some of the studios were already booked. Then, all of a sudden, one day they told me that the set was ready. I was surprised that they could even think of setting it up in such a place ' a barren stretch of land near Bidadi. And that too without compromising on the quality. Probably because the team is fresh, they didn't opt for the normal route of finding studio and putting up the set there. It was completely away from the chaos of Bengaluru, which allowed us to do live recording,' says Ramesh.
 
 
  
 The actor adds that he was also impressed that the team stayed away from clich'd colours and used the ones that you usually see in German films. The aesthetics apart, the fact that the set was so isolated meant that once there, the sole focus of the actor was on his scene. 'Usually, in studios, there are other actors shooting on the next floor, so they come over and meet me. But this set was completely cut off from civilization, so I was only thinking about the movie, and nothing else,' says Ramesh.
