NAGPUR: “We need to understand that each person is wired in a certain way and different kinds of temperament are required to make life sane. We shouldn’t judge people on their personality traits,” said counsellor, life coach and founder of   and Bhakti Women   at a special talk at Vidarbha Industries Association, Civil Lines.

 The purpose of the talk titled ‘Know yourself to grow yourself’ was to help individuals understand temperaments which constitute to their unique personalities and the way they can take cognisance of their strengths and weaknesses. The programme was organized by VIA’s HRD Forum on Thursday.
 
 Purohit discussed four basic yet extreme personality types — popular sanguine,  , perfect melancholy and peaceful phlegmatic — which are prevalent in all human beings but in varying degrees. According to her, a person’s natural response to a particular situation depends on which personality type is more dominant.
 
 Each type has its own basic desire, said Purohit.
 
  “A sanguine’s basic desire is have fun at all time regardless of the circumstances. A choleric’s desire is to take control over each situation making them more dominant. A perfect melancholy is conscientious and analytical so their basic desire is seeking perfection in everything around them. A phlegmatic is more easy going and clam therefore peace is this type’s basic desire,” she said.
 
 Purohit cited rational emotive behaviour Therapy designed by the late   Albert Ellis which uses the ABCDE model to create a sense of introspection in an individual.
 
 “It is a process of self-evaluation where activating event (A) triggers (B) self-defeating belief held for the event, taking action on the belief may results in a consequence (C). Then one disputes that belief to consider a different way to interpret the event which finally leads to the (E) the effect of the consequence of disputing the self-defeating belief,” she added.
