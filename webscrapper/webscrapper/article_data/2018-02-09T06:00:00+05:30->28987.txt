Kolkata: Bengal CPM’s political draft resolution for the upcoming party state conference from March 5-8 in Kolkata won’t be a photocopy of the draft adopted at the central committee meet recently held here that rules out any understanding, leave aside any alliance, with Congress.

 The CPM state committee on Thursday instead took an open-ended approach while finalising the broad points of the draft. The draft captures CPM’s tryst with Congress in the 2016 assembly polls, and takes into account the stricture the party CC gave to the Bengal contingent from its June 2017 meet against Bengal CPM’s electoral decision. The draft also narrates the party’s experience in carrying out the CC decision in the last few months in the run-up to the state conference.
 
 While there is no disagreement over the need to occupy the opposition space in Bengal when BJP is using it to a great extent, opinions vary over ways to achieve the aim. A sizeable section in district units, namely Kolkata, Purba Burdwan, Howrah and Hooghly, is averse to getting into any kind of understanding with Congress on the ground that it would weaken Left’s support bases instead of strengthening it. However, there is strong pressure from the party ranks in middle class areas and also in the minority areas to get into an understanding with Congress. The CPM state secretariat has left this debate for the CPM party congress and instead concentrated on vote craft for the panchayat polls. 
 
 “There is no point closing the debate,” a CPM state secretariat member said.
