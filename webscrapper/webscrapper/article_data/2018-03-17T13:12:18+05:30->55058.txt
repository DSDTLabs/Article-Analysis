TRICHY: In a major boost to the   situated here, the bureau of energy efficiency (BEE), coming under the Union ministry of power, on March 13 awarded the workshop ‘5-Star’ rating for energy efficiency. Before this, the workshop had a 4-star rating.

 General Manager of Southern Railway, P N Kulshrestha, who visited the workshop situated in Ponmalai on Friday, presented the certificate on behalf of BEE to the officials. “GM came to the workshop around 10.30am and was there till 2.30pm and visited all the shops. He was very impressed with the works that have been going on,” said chief workshop manager P N Jha. He also added that the general manager presented several other awards.
 
 The energy management system (EnMS) established by the workshop to continuously monitor and improve its energy performance resulted in the reduction of carbon footprint by a number of measures. Due to the energy conservation measures, electricity consumption was brought down from 74,37,390 units in 2014-15 to 58,22,050 units in 2016-17. Similarly, consumption of coke also came down from 131 tonne during 2014-15 to 20 tonne in 2016-17.
 
 The energy conservation measures like elimination of cylinder liner plating, power saving by switching off transformers by back feeding arrangement during lean periods and optimisation of utilisation of compressed air systems, replacement of transformer based welding plants with energy efficient IGBT based welding plants, alternate fuel usage, improving the efficiency of the lighting system and more, resulted in the saving of Rs 1.11 crore through efficient energy management alone during 2016-17.
 
 For this, in December 2017, the workshop received the first prize in National Energy Conservation Award 2017 by the BEE in railway workshop category. The award was given by President of India Ram Nath Kovind and received by principal chief mechanical engineer, Southern Railway, A K Kathpal. The workshop also bagged the ‘National Excellent Energy Efficient Unit’ award from   in 2017.
 
 Golden Rock Workshop was set up initially in Nagapattinam by the erstwhile   in 1897 to predominantly cater to steam locomotive maintenance. It was eventually shifted to Ponmalai in Trichy and started functioning from 1928 onwards.
