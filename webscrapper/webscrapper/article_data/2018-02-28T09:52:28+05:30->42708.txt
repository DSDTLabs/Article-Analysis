MADURAI: In a bitter-sweet victory for the brother of a murder victim, Madras high court has held that he was entitled to file an appeal against a lower court order acquitting his brother’s alleged killers.

 A division bench of justice S   and justice T  , however, dismissed his appeal saying the trial court had rightly acquitted all the nine suspects in the murder of   belonging to Thanjavur district. One accused had died during the pendency of trial.
 
 It all started on April 13, 2011 when a gang attacked Karuppan over land dispute and murdered him. 
 
 The Vallam police registered cases against 10 people, including Rajini and Honest Raj. As one of the accused died during trial, the additional district and sessions court acquitted all the remaining nine people of all charges on June 15, 2015. Assailing the verdict, Karuppan’s brother   filed the present appeal in the high court. His appeal, however, was opposed on the ground that he had no locus standi at all to file it.
 
 The bench headed by justice Vimala, however, rejected the contention and said: “The locus standi of the brother of the deceased to file an appeal challenging the acquittal of the accused is the issue raised in the appeal. The Delhi high court, in Ram Phal’s case, had elaborately considered the conflicting views of various high courts and held that it is impermissible for an appellate court to shut out an appeal by a legal heir based on her/his not being an immediate heir, or being lower down in hierarchy vis-à-vis entitlement to the crime victim’s estate. This court is in perfect agreement with the views expressed by the Delhi high court. Thus, this court holds that the brother is entitled to file the appeal as legal heir of the deceased as well as the victim of the occurrence and his appeal is maintainable.”
 
 Though the bench held that the brother was legally entitled to challenge the trial court order, concluded that the appeal lacked merit and hence it deserved to be rejected.
