BENGALURU: A 37-year-old autorickhaw driver attempted to kill his wife by stabbing her and later committed suicide assuming she was dead. This happened at the couple’s residence in Ramamurthy Nagar, east Bengaluru, on Friday.

 KR Puram police said Henry Fernandez, a resident of Devasandra, and Chitra had tied the knot a decade ago, but the marriage ran into choppy waters three years ago. They have two children. 
 
 Henry suspected Chitra’s fidelity, which often triggered fights between the two. She went back to her native home in Devasandra 10 days ago but Henry convinced her and managed to get her back home.
 
 According to police, Henry dropped off his children at school around 9am and returned home at Noon, intending to kill Chitra. He stabbed her on the arms and neck from behind. She collapsed on the floor. Thinking she had died, he committed suicide by hanging from a ceiling fan. 
 
 The incident came to light around 5pm when Chitra’s brother Mahendra visited the house. Police said she was found unconscious in a pool of blood. Devendra rushed her to a nearby hospital and informed KR Puram police. Chitra is recovering.
