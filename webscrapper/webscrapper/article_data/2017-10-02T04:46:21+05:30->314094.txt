New Delhi: Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board ( ) has informed the high court that it intends to raze all illegal encroachments from public   in north Delhi.

 The project, if implemented, will benefit children and morning walkers in the area, with the government body assuring the court that it won’t spare even religious structures if these encroach into public parks.
 
 DUSIB recently told a bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru that demolition of illegal structures on public land at Metro Vihar Phase-I and Phase-II of Holambi Kalan in north Delhi was also planned on September 19, but could not be brought into effect due to lack of police force.
 
 DUSIB’s reply came on a plea by three individuals, who alleged that the authorities failed to take action against some religious structures situated in various parks in the vicinity of Metro Vihar but are targeting only one religious structure.
 
 But   trashed the petitioners in view of the stand taken by the Board, and dismissed their plea. In rejecting the plea, HC added that “the apprehension expressed by the petitioners that only one religious structure is being targeted is wholly unfounded.”
 
 It also directed the police to “cooperate and provide necessary force to DUSIB and North Delhi Municipal Corporation to carry out necessary action” so that encroachments from public parks in the zone could be immediately removed or demolished.
 
 Three petitioners had claimed that the authorities were only demolishing a mosque, Bilal Masjid, but were not taking the same action against other allegedly illegal structures located there. They claimed that they should not be “singled out” and “removed” alone particularly when the status of other religious places situated in the vicinity is the same.
 
 However, the petitioners’ contentions were opposed by DUSIB and north corporation, who said the said structure admittedly being illegal was now subject to demolition.
