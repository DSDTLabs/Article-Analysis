Kanyakumari: “We are depressed and are working with fear since the MLAs and those accompanying them barged into my office, hurled words of abuse, attacked my department staff and also damaged properties in my office,” said joint registrar (cooperatives) for Kanyakumari district, Nadukkattu Raja.

 Raja told TOI that said he was discharging his duties in his office when the incident took place. “As the observer of the cooperative society elections, I am not supposed to get up or greet the MLAs, as it will be a violation of the code of conduct. But despite the harassment and listening to unparliamentary words we arranged chairs for them,” he said.
 
 Not giving them due respect by standing up to greet them was the main contention of the MLAs on Wednesday.
 
 The official claimed that there was no fault on his part and that he will strongly pursue the case till the MLAs and other accused are arrested and appropriate legal action is taken against them. “If I don’t pursue action it will set a bad example and give them the courage to attack or control supply officers and sub-registrars in our department,” he added.
 
 He said the incident has been reported to the commissioner and the registrar of the cooperatives department. Denying charges of favouritism, he said there are 181 cooperative societies in Kanyakumari district. Election will be conducted for 451 director positions in the 41 of societies (11 directors per society) in the first phase election on April 2.
 
 “We received 928 nominations and were scrutinising them only on Wednesday. In all, we rejected only 11 nominations for valid reasons. It included people from the ruling party. But the MLAs and their supporters overreacted hours before the list of eligible candidates was published at 5pm on Wednesday,” Raja added.
 
 Meanwhile, DMK MLA N Suresh Rajan told reporters here on Thursday that they went to the office of the joint registrar only to point out irregularities in the elections.
