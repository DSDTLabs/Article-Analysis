CHANDIGARH: Vishvas Gupta, former husband of 
  —the adopted daughter of rape convict   head 
  - on Friday alleged threat to his life. Gupta, who allegedly faced five criminal cases at the behest of Gurmeet and Honeypreet, said, “Though the   head is in jail, he can do anything even now.”

 Gupta said Balwant Singh Rajoana, who was held guilty of assassinating former   chief minister Beant Singh, had saved his life from the dera head’s followers during the time he (Gupta) was lodged at Nabha jail. Gupta alleged that a conspiracy to kill him was hatched by the dera head’s followers in the jail and an undertrial was given a supari of Rs 10 lakh to kill him.
 
 “As Rajoana came to know about this, he alerted me and warned the jail superintendent as well. My life was saved. Rajoana ji could be anybody for anyone but for me he is a god who saved my life in jail. Even while leaving jail, some people had threatened me with dire consequences,” he alleged.
 
 He further alleged that his ex-wife Honeypreet and Gurmeet had illicit relations. He, however, dismissed the rumours that Honeypreet would arrange girls for the dera head. “I can’t say what happened before 2009 when Honeypreet started living with the dera head. She would never allow any other woman to go close to the baba, hence I dismiss the allegation of arranging women for the dera head,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, referring to Honeypreet, Gupta dismissed rumours that she might have been eliminated. “Dera followers don’t do anything without Gurmeet’s orders. Since she is the one closest to him, she will never be targeted by them. You have seen this on August 25 and on other days as well,” he said.
