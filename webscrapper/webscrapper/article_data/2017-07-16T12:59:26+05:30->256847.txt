NAGPUR: Software giant   ( ) has agreed to provide about Rs30 crore as part of its corporate social responsibility for a project to de-silt Maji   located in eastern Vidarbha. Silting and encroachments on the 300-year old waterbodies had reduced their capacity to store water for irrigation and enhancing water table.

 Announcing this on Friday, the chief minister’s office said the funds would be utilized specifically to de-silt and deepen 141 tanks. It would increase irrigation area of these tanks by a total of 15,738 hectares benefiting around 16,000 paddy growers. The work will be done in three years.
 
 The MaMa tanks are gift to eastern Vidarbha’s districts of Bhandara, Chandrapur, Gadchiroli and Gondia by the erstwhile Gond kings who ruled the region 300 years ago. These tanks were built by specially recruiting artisans from Rajasthan. After the British took over, these tanks were given to herdsmen called Malgujars for upkeep. 
 
 In 1950, the state government took control of 6,700 of these tanks that were mainly serving as irrigation source in the paddy belt and were renamed Maji (ex) Malgujari tanks (or MaMa talao in short).
 
 A scheme to clean them up was drawn a couple of years ago by the government but could not take off for want of funds. Recently, chief minister   proposed to TCS ex-chief and current chairman of Tata Sons N Chandrashekharan for funds for the project under its CSR. The Tata boss responded promptly and favourably. TCS has drawn-up a detailed three-year funding and workflow plan. In 2017-18 it will provide Rs3.72 crore to start the work, followed by Rs12.49 crore the next year and finally Rs13.49 crore in 2019-20. TCS will also provide technical manpower support and machinery.
