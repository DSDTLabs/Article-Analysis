PATNA: With his five-year term as   chairman ending on Monday, Awadhesh Narayan Singh handed over the charge to vice-chairman Haroon Rashid.

 Rashid will function as acting chairman till a full-time chairman is elected during the monsoon session of the House in July. He will administer the oath of House membership to four recently elected members at a ceremonial function to be held on Tuesday morning. 
 
 The new members are outgoing chairman Singh from Gaya graduate constituency, Birendra Yadav from Saran graduate constituency, Sanjeev Kumar Singh from Kosi teachers’ constituency and Sanjeev Singh Shyam from Gaya teachers’ constituency. The outgoing chairman is a BJP leader.
 
 RJD MLC and former CM Rabri Devi has already gone on record to say that the new council chairman would be selected jointly by Grand Alliance partners JD (U), RJD and Congress, implying thereby that CM Nitish Kumar will not take a decision on the matter unilaterally.
 
 Nitish’s JD (U) has officially echoed her. “Selecting the new chairman will not be difficult. The grand alliance leaders will sit together for the purpose,” said a JD (U) source, adding the nominee would be a consensus choice.
 
 Political observers said the RJD would like to have its nominee as the council chairman since the assembly Speaker is from the JD (U). The problem, however, is that the Congress in that situation may also stake its claim. Sources said one of its senior members is reportedly lobbying for it.
 
 The pulls and pressures may strengthen the position of Nitish in taking a call on matter as RJD president Lalu Prasad is currently facing rough weather due to an adverse Supreme Court order in the fodder scam cases in which he is an accused.
 
 In the 72-member House, the JD (U) has 28 members while the BJP has 23, RJD has seven, Congress has six and CPI has two members. While the LJP has one MLC, there are four Independents. Acting chairman Rashid was an RJD leader.
