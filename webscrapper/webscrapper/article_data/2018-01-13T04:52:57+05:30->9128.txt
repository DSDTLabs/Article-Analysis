MUMBAI: It seems that vehicle towing charge is much more than the penalty for illegal parking. A private firm, Nagpur-based   Pvt Ltd, appointed for providing vans to tow illegally parked vehicles, earned Rs 9.22 crore from December 2016 to November 2017 while the traffic police managed to earn only Rs 5.91 crore as penalties towards illegal parking.

 The traffic cops made Rs 3.3 crore lesser than the firm which has been mired in controversy.
 
 According to a Right to Information ( ) plea filed by activist Anil  , a contract was given to Vidarbha Infotech in December 2016. A traffic constable accompanies the towing van agents and directs which illegally parked vehicle needs to be picked up.
 
 From December 2016 to November 2017, 1.95 lakh two-wheelers and over 99,996 four-wheelers were towed for illegal parking. “The contract has been given for 75 months,” said Galgali.
 
 “I had demanded information about the board of directors of Vidarbha Infotech and the firm’s balance sheet. But the traffic department said they do not have this information. I want the government to scrutinize this contract,” he added.
