Salem: Following a surprise raid, sleuths of the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) seized unaccounted cash worth Rs 2.5 lakh from the Tasmac District Manager’s Office here on Friday.

 A team led by S Chandramouli had rushed to the office situated at Sandhiyur area near Mallur after receiving a tip-off. “As many as 256 Tasmac outlets and more than 200 bars are functioning in the district. According to the information we received, supervisors and salesmen at these outlets were forced to pay Rs 10,000 to Rs 30,000 as bribe to the officials at the DM’s office. The officials used to receive as much as Rs 30 lakh as bribe every month,” Chandramouli said.
 
 DVAC officials have initiated an inquiry against Tasmac district manager Deivanayaki about the Rs 2.5 lakh unaccounted money recovered from the office. “We will initiate action against corrupt officials after our inquiry,” the official added.
