NEW DELHI: India’s medal rush at the 2018 Commonwealth Games has continued with shooter   winning gold in the women’s 50m rifle 3 position finals, followed by   with silver. With Sawant’s gold, India have matched the 15 gold medals won four years ago at the Glasgow CWG. 

 
 
 
  
  
 
 At the Belmont Shooting Centre on Friday, Sawant - who yesterday claimed silver in the women’s 50m rifle prone - shot a CWG record total of 457.9 for her second medal of the Gold Coast Games and seventh at the CWG overall, following two golds in 2006 and a pair of silvers and a bronze in 2010. For the Arjuna awardee, who in 2010 became the first Indian sportswoman to win gold at the World Shooting Championship, her two medals in successive days will put in shade her disappointing showing at the 2016 Rio Olympics. 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Sawant, 37, had entered the eight-member women’s 50m rifle 3 positions after finishing third in qualification with a total of 582-31x, while Moudgil had topped it with a qualifying record total of 589-32x. In the finals, the 24-year-old Moudgil stayed in contention for a medal with strong series of shots, and as the competition was whittled away her scores ensured she was in line for gold with compatriot Sawant. She finished second to Sawant with a combined score of 455.7 for her first CWG medal. 
 
 In March, Moudgil had won her first International   (ISSF) World Cup medal, a silver in the same event. 
 
 Taking bronze was Scotland’s Seonaid McIntosh with a total score of 444.6.
