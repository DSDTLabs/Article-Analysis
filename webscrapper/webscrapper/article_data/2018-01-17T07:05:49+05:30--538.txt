CHENNAI: The Archaeological Survey of India ( ) would soon write to the National Gallery of Australia ( ), which has sought additional details from Indian authorities to facilitate retrieval of four idols that were stolen from Tamil Nadu. But, the missive to the Canberra-based museum is unlikely to contain any new information about the artefacts as the state   has not furnished fresh details yet.

 According to ASI sources, the planned letter was in response to the NGAs communication last year. “A reply will be sent to the Canberra based museum’s letter though without any new details as we are yet to get response from the Tamil Nadu police,” a senior ASI official told TOI from New Delhi. On November 17 last year, the ASI had forwarded a letter from the NGA to the idol wing in this regard. Two months have passed and the ASI has still not received any communication from the police.
 
 The NGA, official sources said, had sought specific details such as the exact part of the temple from where the idols were stolen. “It was necessary for the   to pursue the matter with their government. The   has already given sufficient evidence to prove that the artefacts originated from the state. Had they given the required details, it would have further strengthened our case for retrieval,” the ASI official added.
 
 In April 2017, the NGA had declared that four sculptures in its collection was reported as stolen by the idol wing of the TN police.
 
 However, it was not clear whether the TN police were directly handling the case with Australian authorities. There have previously been cases of the state police retrieving   independently from overseas. This led to the retreival of two idols namely Boodevi and Chakarathalavar in May 2016 from the US. While the Tamil Nadu idol wing police were not available for comment, a senior police official said the idol wing responds in three days to all official queries.
