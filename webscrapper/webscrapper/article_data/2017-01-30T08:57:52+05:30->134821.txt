GUWAHATI: After the   of 22   were found in   recently, the state government has decided to move a   near the water body to another place. 

 Though a preliminary examination has not found any toxic substances in the birds' stomachs, environmentalists have long protested against the presence of pollutants so close to an eco-sensitive site.
 
 Additional chief secretary MGVK Bhanu said, "The dumping ground has some problems so we are thinking of alternate arrangements."
 
 Locals, however, feel that simply moving the dumping ground would not be a solution. "The problem should be addressed properly. The locality is important for the greater adjutant storks. There has to be a proper waste management system," said Jayaditya Purkayastha of Help Earth Foundation.
