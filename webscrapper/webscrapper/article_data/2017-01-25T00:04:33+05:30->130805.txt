Chennai:   police have nabbed five people in connection with the murder of a 74-year-old doctor in his apartment last week. The accused were identified as Arun, the son-in-law of the doctor's ex-maid Prema from Thrissur, and his friends Sathish, Arjun, Prem Kumar and Jeeva.

 The doctor Narasimha Reddy was found dead by his tenant Chandrasekaran early on Saturday morning at G K Riverbank Apartments on Second Cross Street, Karpagam Garden Avenue. Reddy had been living alone in the four-bedroom apartment. He had rented out three other rooms.
 
 Preliminary investigations revealed that Reddy had sacked his domestic maid Prema after she had reportedly stolen his gold chain. A special team, which went to her home town, returned after ruling out her hand in the murder. However, the needle of suspicion fell on her son-in-law Arun who, along with his wife Deepa, had frequented the doctor's house when she was employed there.
 
 Arun was under the impression that the doctor was in possession of a huge stash of money. When he told his friends about this, they planned to loot Reddy’s house. On Friday morning, the gang visited the apartment complex to finalise the modus operandi. They came to know that the security guard at the complex was on leave for a week.
 
 The gang gained entry to Reddy’s house through the balcony on Friday night. They found the doctor reading a book and brandished a knife threatening him to hand over the money in the house. “The doctor told them that he did not have any cash and all his transactions were made through banks,” said an investigating officer who had interrogated the suspects. The gang, which refused to believe him, tied him up and slit his throat. They searched for the money in vain before escaping empty-handed.
