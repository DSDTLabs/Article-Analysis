PUNE:   and   spaces are   to dump their garbage in Pune limits, according to residents and officials. 

 The governing bodies of these villages are not able to handle the load and can’t provide solutions to basic issues such as garbage disposal, leading to mismanagement of waste, feel residents.
 
 “People from other areas are migrating here to buy affordable real estate. It has compounded the garbage disposal problems. The Grampanchayat is not able handle the load, so people either throw the garbage in the river, burn it, or dump in PMC areas,” said Nanded village resident   
 
 S C N Jatar, founder of  , said lack of planning at Grampanchayat level is to be blamed. “The permissions to build new housing projects were given at the village level. Local bodies are responsible for the haphazard growth, so now they should find a way out of it rather than blaming others,” he said.
