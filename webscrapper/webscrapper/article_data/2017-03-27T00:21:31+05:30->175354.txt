NAVI MUMBAI: Activists are questioning the vast quantity of   currently stored along the Belapur-Ulwe creek side by Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) officials. They claimed that there is not much clarity on the quantity and the cost of sand being kept here.

 Environmentalist Sumaira Abdulali of Awaaz Foundation NGO told TOI that there is no information on why so much black sand is being stored at Belapur, and what is the rate (per brass) for storing it there. “When we contacted the MMB authorities, they told us that the sand is being unloaded at   and Sewri in Mumbai from Revdanda in Raigad district. We are now seeking more information on this,” she added.
 
 City-based activist Anarjit Chauhan added that it is not clear how many brass of sand was unloaded in Belapur. “The question is that a private operator can easily bring in more than the fixed legal limit of sand. This can be detrimental to the river bed from where the sand is being mined,” he said. Chauhan also questioned MMB allowing storage of sand without having clarity on the consignment details.
 
 A Patil, port official of MMB at Belapur, said that they have given all related documents to the activists who questioned its presence. 
 
 But even though MMB officials have stated that all rules are being followed, the activists are still not convinced. “Last October, over 4,000 tonnes of imported white sand was kept at the Belapur but no proper documents were available as to how much rent was paid to MMB for it. We are only demanding public information be provided on such issues, as it involves state revenues. There should be no scope for any malpractices,” said Abdulali.
