  Directed by Anup Baral, this Nepali play is a tale of polyandry in the family and conflict between an individual’s freedom and the culture and society he or she lives in the Himalayas. 
  
  
  Thangla
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  Another play adopted from Shakespearean tragedy, this Italian production by famed director   highlights the clash between the ethereal and the obscure. It also deals with the conflict between fathers and sons, and with the power of rhetoric, seen as a sign of strength and decadence. (Chahumukh; 7:00 P.M.)
