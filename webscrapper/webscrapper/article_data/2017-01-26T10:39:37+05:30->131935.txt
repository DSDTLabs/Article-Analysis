LUCKNOW: In order to give a full-throttle launch to their  , chief minister and Samajwadi Party chief   and Congress vice-president   will hold a joint   on January 29 in Lucknow.

 Earlier, the two were scheduled to make a joint announcement about the alliance on January 22, but later the two state chiefs Raj Babbar and Naresh Uttam did the honours and addressed a press conference in Lucknow. The deal was sealed after overcoming a series of hiccups. However, the low-profile launch couldn't make the desired impact, therefore a joint press conference has been hastily planned.
 
 Akhilesh has already started addressing rallies, but Rahul is so far busy in Punjab which is going to the polls in the first phase on February 11. He is likely to come back to Lucknow for a joint press conference on Sunday, January 29. Therefter, joint rallies of the two leaders are likely to be scheduled. “The Akhilesh-Rahul show is aimed at removing confusion and promote mutual confidence to make it a smooth and long-lasting friendship,“ says a UP Congress leader. Large-scale preparations are undergoing to make the joint press conference a mega event. An extensive media coverage of the event has been planned. Sources said that Akhilesh and Rahul-Priyanka Vadra are in constant touch through strategist Prashant Kishore to draw the strategy for the event. Sources also confirmed that once Akhilesh and Rahul kick off their joint election campaign, Priyanka and Kannauj MP Dimple might also go for a joint campaign to send a clear message to the youth, women and Muslims, apart from their traditional supporters to defeat the `Modi Machine'.
 
 Highly placed sourced confirmed that Rahul is coming to Lucknow   and after the launch, a common minimum programme would drafted. It's for the first time that the Congress and SP are having pre-poll alliance to ensure a fierce three-cornered contest in UP.
