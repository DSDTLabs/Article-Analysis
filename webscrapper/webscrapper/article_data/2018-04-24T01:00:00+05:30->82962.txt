It was his mean act as Thangabali in ' ' (2013) that catapulted him to fame. Since then,   has played several characters, mostly negative, in both films and on television. The actor is currently seen as the antagonist on the TV show, ' ', though his character turns positive in the end.
 
 His track is ending soon and the actor is happy with the kind of work he is being offered. “I was introduced on the show during Christmas and my track was scheduled to end on February 14. However, it was extended because of encouraging feedback. The best part is that I got to do a lot more than just be the bad boy; I got to dance, romance and also attempt comedy.”
 
 Nikitin is now looking out for positive roles and feels that there is a lot more to him as an actor, which is yet to be explored. He says, “I am selective about work, which makes me slower than my contemporaries. I now want to take up more substantial and positive roles so that I can prove my range as an actor. However, that doesn’t mean that I will turn down a negative role, if it’s interesting. I don’t discriminate between characters, I just want to do good work. Even if I played a villain in 'Ishqbaaaz', they humanised the character. A villain is expected to be dominating and menacing, but at the end of the day, he is also vulnerable. There is a lot of stagnancy in   when it comes to villains. Actually, there are no villains left after legendary actors like Pran saab and Amrish Puriji. While villains have great scope on TV and in South films, the culture is diminishing in Bollywood. I hope the culture of having strong villains returns to Hindi cinema.”
