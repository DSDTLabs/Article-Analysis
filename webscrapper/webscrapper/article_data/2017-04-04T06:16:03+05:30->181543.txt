AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday refused to grant a stay on possible arrest of the trustee of HB   School,  , and its principal Poonam Sedani in connection with the cheating complaint filed against them by a parent for charging huge fees from KG students on allegedly false promise of getting   affiliation for the school.

 A trial court earlier denied anticipatory bail to Kapadia and Sedani.
 
 The high court has also refused to accept the compromise arrived at between the management and the complainant at this stage, and orally observed that when the future of 400-odd students is at the stake, the court cannot just turn a blind eye to it, sources said.
 
 This happened during the hearing on a quashing petition filed by Kapadia and Sedani on the basis of a compromise reached at between them and a complainant Chirag  .
 
 As the parents found out that the school at Memnagar did not have CBSE affiliation as it continued to offer   curriculum, the complaint was filed with Ghatlodia police by Parekh.
 
 Further hearing in this case is kept in June.
