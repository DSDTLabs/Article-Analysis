PANAJI: The   (VVPAT) device, which was used for the first time in the state assembly elections, are not integral to counting and would not be taken out of strongrooms along with control units on March 11.

 Connected to the   (EVM), the printer-like apparatus that was used in all 1,642   on February 4, generated a receipt indicating the symbol and name of the candidate one voted for.
 
 CEO officials say the purpose of the VVPAT is to provide feedback to voters in a ballot-less voting system that their vote has been registered for the candidate against whom they have pushed the button and has no major role to play in counting.
 
 The VVPAT rolls are stored within a sealed compartment below the printer and will be taken out for counting only if a candidate, his election agent or counting agent (in the candidate’s absence) applies in writing to the returning officer (RO) to count the printed paper slips in any or all the polling stations.
 
 “On such application being made, the RO shall pass a speaking order on whether the counting of paper slips shall be done or not,” read a statement issued by the  .
 
 The ECI goes on to state that while taking a decision on the matter, the RO will consider whether the total number of votes polled in that polling station is more or less than the margin of votes between the winning candidate and candidate making the application, whether the EVM had any defect and was replaced and whether there was any complaint about VVPAT not printing paper slips or any other complaint under Rule 49 MA by any voter in that polling station during the poll.
 
 If the RO decides to allow counting of paper slips of any polling station, it will take us back to the pre-EVM era where each of the printed slips will have to be manually counted, a government official said.
 
 Should a discrepancy arise between the count of votes displayed on the control unit and the paper slips, the result sheet will have to be amended according to the printed paper slip count following which the RO will announce the amendments made and declare the new result.
