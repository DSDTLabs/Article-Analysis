BENGALURU: Police arrested four people for allegedly molesting a woman on a street in Kammanahalli, east Bengaluru, in the early hours of January 1, and launched a manhunt for two other accomplices. 

 The action came within 36 hours of TOI carrying the chilling story of perverts sexually assaulting the girl. Investigations were launched into the Kammanahalli case after TOI handed over to the police   footage of the incident. 
 
 Bengaluru City police commissioner Praveen Sood identified the main accused as Ayyappa, alias Nitish Kumar (19), a delivery boy for online portals and a student of ITI. Ayyappa is allegedly the youth seen in the CCTV footage sexually assaulting the woman and throwing her to the ground.
 
 Ayyappa fled on a scooter on which his accomplice, Leno, alias Lenin Patrick (20), helper in a private company and a college student, was waiting. Both Ayyappa and Leno were arrested.
 
 Two others - Sudhi, alias Sudhesh (20), and Somasekhara, alias Chinni (24), both residents of Fraser Town - waiting at the end of the lane were also arrested. Sudhesh, too, worked as a delivery boy for online portals while Somashekar was a driver. Police are looking out for two others who were waiting with them.
 
 Police said the accused were arrested after analysis of CCTV footage from at least four cameras other than the one that recorded the assault that night. 
 
 The police commissioner said the accused had been stalking the girl, who had recently moved to the city, for a few days. One of the accused lived close to where the girl did. "The night the incident took place, the youths were partying by the road. When the girl got down from an autorickshaw, one of them identified her. They then followed her and molested her," he said.
