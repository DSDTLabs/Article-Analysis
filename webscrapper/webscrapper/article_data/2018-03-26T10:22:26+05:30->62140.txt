LUCKNOW: On a day when former Bihar chief minister   was convicted in a fourth fodder scam case for 14 years, Samajwadi Party (SP) leaders and BJP rebel MP   met him in Ranchi, indicating a show of solidarity.

 The recent success of BSP-SP arrangement in Phulpur and   by-polls has seen growing proximity of disgruntled leaders from JD(U), SP, BJP and RJD, including former NDA convener   landing at SP supremo Akhilesh Yadav’s residence last week.
 
 The meeting, that took place between Yadav and SP leaders-led by Kiranmoy Nanda came a day after BJP swept nine Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 SP however described Sinha’s presence along with them at Ranchi hospital as purely coincidental.
 
 “It was sheer coincidence that Shatrughan ji too came. The anti-BJP front is getting stronger,” said Nanda. RJD sources said that Lalu offered Sinha a Lok Sabha seat from the same constituency of Patna Sahib.
 
 SP leaders on Tuesday will also separately meet Yadav’s wife Rabri and son Tejaswi on Tuesday.
 
 “Our purpose is not just political. SP stands by RJD in these trying times. Whether a scam took place or not is a court’s call. But we have sympathies with the Yadav family over four convictions. Lalu ji told us that his BP routinely shot up. I will be meeting his family members now with a message from Akhilesh ji,” said Nanda, who was a fivetime MLA from West Bengal and former minister in Left Front cabinet.
 
 Sources said Lalu insisted SP leaders to convey a message to BSP supremo Mayawati to stand by Akhilesh even after the RS poll debacle which BJP’s candidate trouncing that of BSP in a nail-biting finish.
 
 For one scam, three times punishment. To convey the message. The SP leaders also confirmed that they met former Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren’s family members to drum up support for 2019 united front.
