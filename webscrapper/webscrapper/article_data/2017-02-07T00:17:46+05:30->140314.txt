NEW DELHI: Around 950 inmates — mentally challenged men, women and children — are left to fend for themselves at the   complex, which has space for only 510. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had red-flagged this matter in a 2015 report, saying that the facility was “over-burdened”, ill equipped for medical emergencies and short on staff. In fact, its capacity during the   review was even less—350—and was increased later though falling far short of what is required.

 The report said that a total of 148 deaths occurred during 2009-14. It also found “slackness on the part of the department towards decongestion of the Asha Kiran complex”. The latest findings of the   came after a series of damning reports, which were submitted to the state government and courts over the decade by various panels as well as the CAG.
 
 The 2015 CAG report on the “social, general and economic sectors (non-public sector undertakings) for the year ending on March 31, 2014” pertains to the period before the AAP government came to power. However, it was made public in 2015 when AAP became the ruling party in Delhi.
 
 It begins by pointing out that the department of social welfare is running four homes for the mentally challenged at Asha Kiran complex in Rohini. “The complex houses on average 970 inmates against its designed capacity of 350. In the backdrop of 57 deaths that occurred in the complex during 2009-10, a ministerial committee recommended (February 2010) immediate decongestion of these homes. A decision was taken in the chief minister’s meeting (February 2011) to shift the inmates of the   to Beggars’ Home at Lampur on urgent basis. But concrete steps were not taken by the department for decongestion of the complex,” it said. 
 
 According to the audit report, just one ambulance for 24-hour service and two patient carrying vehicles for office hours—that’s all the facility had for 949 residents during 2013-14, out of which 469 were suffering from profound mental retardation. “Due to non-availability of ambulance, on 8,607 occasions, patients/inmates were carried to different hospitals by autorickshaws, cycle-rickshaws etc,” the CAG noted in the report. Even now the facility lacks a health set-up to cater to the inmates here. 
 
 The CAG pointed out the non-availability of a dietician. A joint inspection report (October 2012) on Asha Kiran complex by the   and the   revealed high prevalence of malnourishment and skin diseases among its inmates. “The governing council of the complex in its meeting (January 2013), discussed and decided that a nutritious diet to the inmates was important.” The audit observed that despite these observations and decisions, there was no dietician available in the complex. 
 
 In 2009, TOI had reported that as many as 75 inmates died between 2004 and 2008 at Asha Kiran Complex, allegedly due to poor healthcare facilities.
