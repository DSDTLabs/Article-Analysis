 A bench of Justice  , which granted relief to the duo in the answer book tender scam case, however, rejected the bail petition of  , a former assistant in the BSEB.
 
 The answer book scam came to light during the course of investigation into the topper scam following which several BSEB officials had been arrested after the state government had lodged an FIR. A separate FIR was subsequently lodged by police in the Kotwali police station in connection with the tender scam.
 
 Advocate Y V Giri, who represented Singh and Jha before the court, said they pleaded before the bench that there was no direct evidence against them. “The signature of Jha on the order letter to the private firm to prepare copies for the BSEB was found forged in forensic test,” he added.
