AHMEDABAD: The city’s   has planned to give up use of   and   in its sprawling campus to promote   among its students and faculty.

 The college’s principal, G P Vadodariya, said that the college has even gone ahead and bought 10 bicycles to promote the activity and they will gradually dissuade people from using fuel-run vehicles inside the campus.
 
 The experiment for promoting eco-friendly behaviour inside the campus got its momentum after a few students succeeded in bringing awareness about traffic rules by denying entry to students who turned up without headgears earlier this month. 
 
 The college principal said that the institute plans to promote use of bicycle for internal transportation.
 
  Ultimately, all students and faculty members would be compelled to ride bicycles to commute between departments. 
 
 To begin with, the faculty members and students have planned that they will observe two days a month as no-vehicle day, when vehicles will not be allowed inside the campus.
