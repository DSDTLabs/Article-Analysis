NEW DELHI:   officials apprehended   Indians who were trying to smuggle in   worth Rs 18 lakh at the   airport on Wednesday. They used   (khajoor) for concealing the gold, replacing the seeds inside with pieces of gold.

 Customs officials said the two men landed at the airport from Saudi Arabia within a few hours of each other. The two passengers were intercepted soon after crossing the green channel. They were both carrying identical packets of dates. Suspicion arose when one of the packets in the bag seemed very heavy and was opened by customs sleuths.
 
 “We noticed gold pieces inside the dates that had been put in place of the seeds quite meticulously. Each date was checked and a total of 56 small pieces of gold were recovered from the two packets, weighing a total of 600 grams,” said a customs official.
