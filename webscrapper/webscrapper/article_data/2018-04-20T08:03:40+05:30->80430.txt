KOLKATA: Six trailers carrying the coaches for the first rake of the E-W Metro corridor finally entered the city late on Thursday, after covering nearly 2,000km from Bengaluru in about 20 days.

 The coaches would have been in Kolkata on Wednesday itself had   staffers in Kharagpur not raised issues over documentation that aren’t required for such consignments. After TOI reported the matter on Thursday, the trailers were allowed to proceed towards Kolkata.
  
  
 The last part of the journey wasn't uneventful though. Despite their huge dimensions, the trailers were difficult to trace near Alampur in Howrah, barely 25-30km from Kolkata where they were parked before the final drive towards the city. The drivers had parked inside a garage near Alampur before going to check the route. As other trucks and trailers passed, the six larger ones were hidden from view from the highway. There was a lot of curiosity among other drivers though. They wanted to know what the consignment was.
 
 “They reached the depot at Salt Lake Sector V by Thursday night. From National Highway 6, the trailers crossed the Nivedita Setu and then took   to Salt Lake. It was a sight when the huge trailers passed through the city roads. Though there were few people around, several motorists stopped to watch,” a KMRCL official said.
 
 The rake is first of 14 built by BEML Ltd and the most advanced that Kolkata has seen till date. It has several features for passenger comfort and safety.
