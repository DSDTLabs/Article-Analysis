AHMEDABAD: For years, utility companies have been digging up roads to lay optic fibre or copper cables, electric lines or even piped gas lines. 

 This not only damages the road, but also violates the five-year guarantee clause which helps road contractors shirk all responsibilities of repair, even at spots where utility companies have not dug. 
 
 A paper recently presented to the   ( ) standing committee has suggested charging rent from utility companies for using the ground under the road. 
 
 The proposal had been mooted in the past two budget sessions, but was set aside for consideration later. 
 
 The paper also lists cities that charge rent from utility companies and even have a formula to arrive at the rent amount. 
 
 “This was proposed in 2011, 2013, 2014 and in 2016. Most of the time, a newly laid road is dig up by telecom companies, then come   gas companies and then electric cables,” said a senior AMC finance official
 
 “This puts the burden of repairs on AMC and the contractors are exempted as there is a violation of the guarantee clause,” the official added .
