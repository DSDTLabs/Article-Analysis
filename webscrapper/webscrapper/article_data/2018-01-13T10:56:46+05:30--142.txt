MUMBAI: The state education department is considering allowing a group or chain of schools to have a board of their own. The government will consult academic experts to check the feasibility of the proposal for academic autonomy of schools. 

 School education minister   said, "There are organisations that have 100 schools or more. We are thinking if we could allow these   to be allowed to set up their own board with curricula they think best suits their students." 
 
 But if such private school boards come into existence, the government will have to devise a way to put all students on a par during admissions. "Students from the state,   and CBSE boards have their marks normalized when applying for college admissions. We will have to find a way to put students of the new boards on the same level," said Tawde.
 
 Private school managements are excited about the idea. "We would love to have our own board. We have a skill-based quality-controlled approach, but starting from Class VII, we turn towards a more board-focused strategy. So, if we get to devise our own curricula, we would be able to do the best for our children," said  , vice-chairperson, VIBGYOR group, which has 29 schools in the country.
 
 But others feel the plan will only add to confusion. "Every school or group of schools has its own ideas and it could be that every board will differ very much from the other. In such a case, it would be difficult to ensure that students learn similar concepts," said father Francis Swamy, joint secretary,   (ABE), which governs over 150 schools in the city.
 
 Recently, the state government set up the Maharashtra International Education Board. Starting with a pilot of 100 government schools, it aims to provide international curricula to its students. The board plans to allow schools from outside the country to be affiliated.
