The family soap opera,   is now all set to hit the 200-episode mark. The serial has Dance Jodi Dance fame   and   (husband of Saravanan Meenatchi’s Rachitha) playing the lead, along with senior actresses Yuvarani and Uma Padmanabhan in crucial roles.

 Poove Poochoodava, which airs on Zee Tamil, is a remake of a Telugu soap, Varudhini Parinayam, which went on for 950 episodes. All the episodes of the Tamil version have, so far, been directed by  , who has been involved with TV serials like Thangam, Kalasam and even one in Telugu. The unique thing about Poove Poochoodava, its producer, Narayanan says, is that it doesn’t have the “adi-thadi and vettu-kuthu” that have become a staple in most TV serials. “A family entertainer that focusses on morals,” is how he describes it.
 
 “We will be reaching the milestone of 200 episodes on January 29. The serial has got a good reach with the audience and the channel is also happy because we are getting higher TRP than the previous show that was being telecast during this same time slot (8pm to 8.30pm),” says Narayanan, who, however, adds that the team hasn’t planned anything special to celebrate the 200th episode.
