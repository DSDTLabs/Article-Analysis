 During the last few days, temperatures had begun to dip in the state to below normal levels, with Pune being one of the locations that recorded the lowest night temperature in Maharashtra twice last week. 
 
 Temperatures were dipping due to an active western disturbance affecting northwest India. The lower level winds associated with the system were blowing into the state from the cooler regions of the north, which had resulted in a dip in day temperatures here.
 
 However, meteorological department officials on Tuesday said that the western disturbance affecting northwest India has been moving away northeastwards. 
 
 "The influence of cold, dry northwesterly winds over Maharashtra is waning, and soon, warm temperatures will again start affecting the region," the official said.
