Visakhapatnam: AP Eastern Power Distribution Company Limited ( ), the only power distribution company (discom) catering to 57 lakh consumers in five districts, has projected a deficit of Rs 1,763 crore in the next financial year.

 Based on the existing power tariffs, the discom estimated the revenue collection of Rs 10,273 crore in all sources, including power charges from the 57 lakh odd consumers. At the same time, the discom projected the expenditure of Rs 12,036 crore. So, the gap between the collection and expenditure is Rs 1763 crore. The money to spend on distribution, salaries of the employees and others will be around Rs 2,630 crore.
 
 In order to bridge the gap, the discom proposed various methods including the hike in power charges every year, but this time, it did not propose it. This time, the discom management requested the government to take appropriate steps like either reimbursement of the entire deficit or show any alternative suggestions to the discom to overcome the additional burden without depending on the consumers by increasing the power charges rates.
 
 APEPDCL chairman and managing director HY Dora said “This time, we did not take decision of hiking the power tariffs for the next fiscal. We just showed our revenue generation and expenditure. We have clearly expressed our financial management to the APERC at the public hearing. We hope that the APERC would take a right decision and suggest the government.”
 
 Another senior official of the discom said that AP government gives subsidy of around Rs 500 to Rs 600 crore every year to the discom. But for the last two years, it is not able to give such amount. Last year, it had given around Rs 300 crore subsidy to the discom.
