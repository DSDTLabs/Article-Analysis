NEW DELHI: The   on Friday said sub-divisional magistrates would act as nodal officers to look into the grievances of   settlers in their areas with regard to availability of healthcare and educational facilities.

 
 The direction came from a bench of Chief Justice   and Justices AM Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud after senior advocates Rajeev Dhavan, Ashwani Kumar, Colin Gonsalves and   said the Rohingya settlers were living in pitiable conditions with inadequate basic amenities.
 
 The allegations were refuted by additional solicitors general Tushar Mehta and Maninder Singh, who drew the bench's attention to the joint inspection report by officials of the ministries of home and health. The report submitted to the court had said Rohingyas were being provided the same facilities that were available to Indian citizens residing in slums adjoining the settlements of illegal migrants and they were not being discriminated against.
 
 Mehta said basic healthcare and education facilities were being provided to the illegal migrants, not because they had a right but because the government was convinced that such amenities must be extended to Rohingyas as a part of their basic human rights. Gonsalves demanded that the Rohingyas be provided with ration cards. However, the court in its interim order asked the SDMs to look into grievances of Rohingya refugees relating to access to healthcare and educational facilities.
