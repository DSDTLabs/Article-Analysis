MARGAO: Even as the   (MMC) decides on the proposal of Black Hole technology to reduce the garbage dump at  , concerns have been raised over its failure in covering the dump with the monsoon looming large. 

 Sources said that though the tender for the task of covering the dump with tarpaulin has been awarded to a contractor, the work is yet to begin at the site. 
 
 Sources pointed out that as it would take at least two weeks for the dump to be entirely covered, the garbage dump could be exposed to rains if the work of covering the dump isnâ€™t commenced immediately.
 
 Locals fear that in the absence of a tarpaulin cover over the garbage dump, leachate from the dump would flow into the storm water drains, thereby posing a health hazard to locals.
 
 Sources said that if rainwater is allowed to seep into the dump before it is covered with tarpaulin, it could also lead to a hazardous situation
