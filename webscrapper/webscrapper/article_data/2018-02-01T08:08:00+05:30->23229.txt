Noida: A Greater Noida-based real estate company said on Wednesday it had approached the Supreme Court with a proposal to complete flats of beleaguered developer  .

 The  , which has been building commercial and residential buildings in the region since 2010 and is owned by Pradeep Agarwal, said it had expressed a financial commitment of Rs 500 crore and 10,000 labourers to revive Amrapali’s incomplete projects and complete 33,000 flats.
 
 “We have proposed our intention in completing and handing over 33,000 flats of Amrapali,” Agarwal, chairman of the group, told TOI on Wednesday. 
 
 “The Supreme Court has asked us to submit a detailed plan in the next seven days. Our proposal is that of completing the flats and earning the balance revenue from buyers. We want to come on board as co-developers,” he added.
 
 Amrapali confirmed Galaxy had made such a proposal. Shiv Priya, executive director, Amrapali, said, “Galaxy has come forward to pump in funds and labourers to start work at our projects. Once the funds are infused and construction work starts, completion of all Amrapali projects will happen within one to three years. The court had asked us to furnish a detailed plan for completion of the pending projects.”
 
 “The builders’ investments would be returned through pending payments from   who have stopped paying because of stagnated construction,” Shiv Priya added. 
 
 “The funds would be infused to revive construction of Silicon Valley, Centurion Park, Dream Valley, Leisure Valley, Leisure Park, Golf Homes, Sapphire and Eden Park,” he said.
 
 The next hearing of the case is on February 21.
