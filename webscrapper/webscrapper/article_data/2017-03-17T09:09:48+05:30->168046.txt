CHENNAI: The   in the city has received a fillip. A detailed project report for phase 2 of the project, covering more than 107 km, will soon be submitted to the Centre, finance minister D Jayakumar announced on Thursday.

 The second phase, including three corridors with 104 stations, is estimated to cost around Rs 44,000 crore. “I am happy to inform that three metro rail corridors under Phase-2 covering a total distance of 107.5km have been included in the JICA [Japan International Cooperation Agency] rolling plan for which a detailed project report has been prepared...,” the minister said in his budget speech.
 
 Chennai Metro Rail Ltd (Cmrl) had submitted the DPR for phase 2 to the state government in December 2016. A private agency began conducting feasibility study in early 2016 and officials visited various sites to finalise the location of stations. A team of JICA officials visited the state at the end of 2016 to discuss the various projects when the state government urged them to give early approval for the project.
 
 Phase 2 will have three lines - from Siruseri to Madhavaram via Old Mahabalipuram Road, Koyambedu to Light House and Perumbakkam to Madhavaram.
 
 On the phase-1extension, the minister said the 9km line connecting Washermenpet to Wimco Nagar via Thiruvottiyur was being implemented at Rs 3,770 crore. Tunneling work is on near Washermenpet after the project was launched in August 2016. The Centre had given its nod in June 2016. Tenders have also been floated to start work for the elevated corridor extending to Wimco Nagar.
 
 Tunnelling for phase 1 will be complete in the next few months, as Cmrl expects to open all lines by mid-2018. Chennai got its first metro rail service with the inauguration of 11km line between Koyambedu and Alandur in June 2014, followed by a 9km line between Little Mount and Chennai Airport in September 2016.
