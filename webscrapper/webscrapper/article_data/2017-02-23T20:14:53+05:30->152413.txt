It was coming — that’s what a lot of people have to say about the breakup between   scion Akhil and  . Apparently, the couple who had been dating for three years, were last seen together at an engagement bash in the city very recently. “They walked in together and looked very much in love. God knows what could have gone so wrong in a few weeks, but it’s sad,” says a friend of the couple.

 
 
 But there was talk that there is trouble in their paradise ever since the duo was spotted having a huge fight at the Hyderabad airport recently, say others. “Initially, we all thought it’s just the usual lovers’ tiff... but things haven’t been the same between them ever since, that’s for sure,” says a close aide of Akkineni family. 
 
 Even as friends of Akhil and Shriya grapple with what could have gone so wrong between the couple, the guests who were informed that the engagement has been called off and that the wedding in Italy won’t happen as planned, are busy speculating. While some say the age gap between the couple wrecked havoc once they got engaged, others say she was upset that he couldn’t give her the kind of time or attention she wanted. Others say Akhil developed cold feet. “He was anyway too young to be hitched. As the date was nearing he got scared about the whole thing. And this put pressure on the relationship.”
 
 Last heard, Akhil went to Goa and plans to plunge into work with a vengeance post that. Shriya meanwhile has taken off to the US. All said and done, that’s one more love story gone awry in tinsel town. It’s another thing that many are looking at it as a great chance to fly to a grand destination wedding called off. Tch.
