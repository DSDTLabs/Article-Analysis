NEW DELHI: Following two sightings of a   in northwest Delhi’s   in five days, the   on Friday set up a   in the area to capture the animal. The big cat is likely to be shifted out, an official said. 

 The decision came after a meeting was held on Friday afternoon with officials from the   station in Narela, the location where the animal was first seen.
 
 Another cage is already being set up, but the final decision on the animal’s translocation will be taken in the next few days, said an official. “The Air Force station authority stressed that they could not function properly with the leopard being sighted regularly around the base. They have requested for its translocation.” 
 
 Another high-level meeting will be held soon and the department is approaching their counterparts in nearby states to find an ideal solution. “The final decision will be taken once the animal is caught. The area where it was seen is quite dense and it may take 10 to 12 days to capture it,” said the official.
 
 The first sighting was made on Monday and   sent out a team to track the leopard. A patrolling team of the forest department was also deployed in the area on Tuesday. “A sighting was again made by the base patrolling staff on Wednesday morning. However, we are yet to find any pugmark. The cage has been set up close to the location where it was sighted last,” said an official. The Indian leopard, a schedule I species, is protected under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and is listed as ‘vulnerable’ under the IUCN red data list.
