Mumbai:   has said that the recent increase in   will have a negative effect on the   of banks. Moody’s added that banks it had rated generated 41% of their operating profits for the quarter ended September 2017 from gains made by selling bonds.

 As of January 12, the 10-year benchmark   yielded 7.28% — more than 30   (100bps = 1 percentage point) higher than two months earlier. 
 
 The ratings agency said, “Rising yields and falling prices are credit-negative for Indian public sector banks ( ), which are exposed to   (MTM) losses from the government bonds’ reduced value in their   portfolios.”
 
 This is especially relevant given that in the last few quarters, a large proportion of PSBs’ operating profit was derived from the profitable sale of investments, which also cushioned necessary high provisioning for loan losses. Over the past few quarters, the contribution of sale of investments to operating profits increased significantly, reaching more than 50% for some banks such as   and  . Moody’s said, “Given the rising government bond yields in the past two months, we expect MTM losses to result in a significant decline in PSBs’ overall profitability because the banks will lose a key source of operating profit.”
 
 Although banks are required to hold only 19.5% of their deposits in government bonds, most PSBs have invested surplus funds. This is largely due to the low demand for credit in the past, coupled with lack of other institutional buyers for government bonds.
 
  and   hold close to 23% of their total assets in government bonds, while it is a little over 22% in the case of State Bank of India. On an average, the 10 PSBs rated by Moody’s invested 21% of their total assets in Indian government securities as of fiscal 2017.
