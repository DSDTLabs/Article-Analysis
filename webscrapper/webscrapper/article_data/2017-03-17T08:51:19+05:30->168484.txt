GUWAHATI: Chief of   (AIUDF) and   MP   has sought special assistance from the Centre to help farmers in the state tide over losses caused by floods and erosion. 

 Ajmal talked about the plight of  's farmers in   on Thursday and added that ineffective implementation of the minimum support price mechanism had dealt them a body blow.
 
 "Floods and erosion have become a bane for farmers. They also face droughts from time to time. On top of that, they are not getting adequate support price for their produce," Ajmal said.
 
 The perfume baron demanded that the Centre waive loans and provide adequate compensation for farmers to offset the damage caused by floods and erosion.
 
 "Loan waiver for farmers should be applicable across the country. Jute industries in the state should be revived. Closure of jute industries has dealt a blow to jute farmers here despite the fact that the state has high prospect in jute cultivation. Assam also needs more cold storage facilities for farmers," Ajmal said.
