Actress   thinks her son   will learn to ' ' women better because his father is not in his life. The 39-year-old   has never named five-year-old Xander's father and she occasionally wonders if she should employ a male assistant to help with the youngster, but thinks he has enough positive influences around him. 

  
  
 "Maybe I should get a many. But Xander has a lot of bro time with the neighbour dads and my dad, who is super young."
 
 "It is good to have strong women around a man. To teach him to respect women. He doesn't have a male person saying, 'Don't cry' or 'You throw like a girl'. All those things that dads accidentally do," Jones said.
