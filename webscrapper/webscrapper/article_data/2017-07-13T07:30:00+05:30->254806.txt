Noida: The surveillance on the Noida-Greater Noida   has come under scrutiny yet again. Over 34,000 challans against traffic violators have been pending for the past three months because of non-functional printers installed at the traffic management centre (TMC), from where the surveillance of the expressway is controlled.

 According to traffic police officers, they have already reported the matter to the Noida Authority. The project is, however, stuck in the e-tendering process.
 
 “We have written to the Noida Authority to get the printers repaired as challanshave been pending for the past three months. Officials of the Authority have told us that since all the projects will have to go through e-tendering process, it is taking time,” SP (traffic) Anil Jha told TOI.
 
 According to the data received from the traffic police, since the two printers are not functional since April, 34,126 challans are yet to be issued. Out of these, 12,199 are from April, 11,913 from May and 10,014 from June.
 
 Sources said these cannot be issued after taking prints from a private shop, as it would put the liability for paying the bill on the officers.
 
 “A print costs Rs 5 these days. Who will bear the bill?” sources told TOI.
 
 In 2015, a whopping amount of Rs 40 crore was spent on the 93 high quality cameras that capture the images of vehicles moving at the speed of 100 kmph.
