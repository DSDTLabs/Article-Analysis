 The university authorities had asked the organisers of the festival to move the installation placed near the entrance of the varsity on the MC road.

 Kalady police confirmed that they have got a police complaint but are yet to register a case.

This bus called 'Kabuki express' has been on campus since February last and is a creation of six students of fine arts department. Then it was modified and the 'Pakistan' element was brought in to mock the stance by right wingers who have been asking all critics to go to Pakistan. The modifications were added and the installation was placed where it is now," said Akhil CM, unit secretary of SFI-affiliated all Kerala Research Scholars Association.
