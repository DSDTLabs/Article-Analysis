CHENNAI: Two years ago, the Internet was divided over an image of a dress posted online with a query if it was blue or white in colour. On Sunday, neuroscientist Shubha Tole had a scientific answer to that question.

 Speaking on sidelines of her talk at Science at the Sabha, Tole said the colour we see in an image depends on the sensitivity of the cells in the eyes and the signal its sends to the brain to interpret. “What we perceive is based on the exact sensitivity in the photoreceptors of our eyes and the exact connectivity in our heads which is   in each one of us,” she said. “The   I see may not be the same that others see and there is no way of communicating what each one of us is the same.” 
 
 Tole was one of the four speakers at the event organised by The Institute of  
 
 Photoreceptors are cells in the retina that convert light rays into nerve signals sent to the brain after being processed by the nerve cells in the eye to be translated into images. The case is different for those who are colour blind having a defect in the gene that help them differentiate between  , she said.
 
 While delving in depth into how the human brain perceives the world, Tole shed light on how it makes memories through hippocampus, an organ in the brain where neurons or grey matter continue to grow even during adulthood. “But not everyone will get the same number of neurons. It depends entirely on our experience of the environment. The brain cells grow and form circuits when we are in a stimulated environment,” she said. 
 
 However, making long term memories depends on how well we perceive and learn what we see and do. Explaining it an example of learning the piano, the scientist said long term memories typically depends on the many trials of learning it. “Circuits get created and then they strengthen. Short term memories get   in the hippocampus and after a point they get consolidated and go into long term memory and get stored elsewhere,” she added.
