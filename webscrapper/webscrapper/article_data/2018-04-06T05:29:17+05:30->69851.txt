 entrepreneur  , who allegedly cheated at least 8,000 people of Rs 2,000 crore with a cryptocurrency-based Ponzi scheme, has been arrested by Maharashtra police. Most of the victims are from the state, many of whom are from Mumbai and Pune.

 Bharadwaj (35) and his brother   (31), who founded Gain Bitcoin, were taken into custody from New Delhi soon after their arrival from Bangkok. “We had information that the duo would come to Delhi. Our team was stationed there for 10 days,” said Rashmi Shukla, commissioner, Pune police. “The scope of the crime is wider than it appears. In April 2014, the brothers started the company GB21 (Gain Bitcoin) in Singapore. In January 2015, they started the website gainbitcoin-.com. Internet surfers, businessmen, doctors and housewives were their targets.”
 
 
  
 
 Through their website, the two would lure investors by offering 180% returns in just 18 months and that too for a minimum investment of 0.1 bitcoin, Shukla said. “They accepted investments online and even in cash and cheque through their appointed agents, whose commission would be one bitcoin.”
 
 When the brothers and their aides found it difficult to give the promised returns to the investors, they floated a new company, M-Cap Phase-1, on April 27, 2016, and created their own cryptocurrency, MCap, Shukla said. “They offered 200% returns in 20 months on an initial investment of minimum $100 in M-Caps. After demonetization in November 2016, they accepted cash from investors.” In January 2017, the duo floated another company, M-Cap Phase-II, which offered 200% returns in just 12 months on an initial investment of $100 in M-Caps, Shukla said. “Here too, they accepted cash.”
 
 Shukla said the duo did not return bitcoins to investors as promised. “Instead, they gave M-Caps, which hardly have any value in the market.”
 
 The state police have appealed to investors who have been cheated by Bharadwaj to approach the Pune cybercrime cell.
