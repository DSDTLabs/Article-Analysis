BENGALURU: The existing   ban on Church Street might be revoked once the city admistration installs automated parking meters on the renovated stretch. Earlier this week,   had barred parking on the road as directed by chief minister  .

 Additional commissioner of police ( ) R   said installing parking meters may help in rethinking the decision. “If parking meters are installed, there will be some discipline among vehicle users,” Hithendra said.
 
 
 People have expressed dismay after the chief minister directed police to ban parking on Church Street to make it pedestrian-friendly. Many had argued that parking should be allowed as BBMP had already constructed parking lots.
 
 Mayor   said they are holding a meeting with traffic cops and other stakeholders on Monday, following which a final decision will be taken to lift the parking ban or to bring in better alternatives.
