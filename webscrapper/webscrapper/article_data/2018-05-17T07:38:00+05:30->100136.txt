GURUGRAM: Residents of Block E,  , Sector 67, have complained that neighbouring villagers trespass on the residential society’s roads. They have also alleged that the   agency is completely neglecting the area, as a result of which parks and other services are suffering.

 
 “When we purchased the flats, the brochure did not mention that this   would be used by outsiders,” said Kavita Rajsekhar, a resident. “But now, it has become a public road. There is a village adjacent to this township. Every day, 30-40 water tankers cross this road to supply water to the villagers. Frequent plying of tankers has completely damaged the road. We pay maintenance fee regularly while someone else is not only overusing the roads, but also damaging them,” she said.
 
 According to residents, the society was supposed to have gates on the side where it faces the neighbouring villages. “But in reality, this is no gated colony. The villagers keep frequenting the society, as the gates remain open. We have brought our complaints to the attention of the builder, Ansal, several times, but they have done nothing about it,” said Sunita Verma, another resident.
 
 “By evening, villagers throng the two parks in the block and drink alcohol in the open without fear of action,” added  , who also lives in Block E.
 
 The block has 20 homes with around 60 residents, who said they pay Rs 1.75 per sq ft as maintenance charges. Ruchi Jain, a resident, said: “Despite our paying maintenance charges regularly, there is no visible repair or maintenance. There is only one security guard when we are supposed to have three. And he too is from the nearby village, so hardly ever takes action against the intruders.”
 
 The maintenance agency,  , couldn’t be reached for their comment.
