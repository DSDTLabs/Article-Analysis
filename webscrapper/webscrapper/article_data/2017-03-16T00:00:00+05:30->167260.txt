Actress   is taking on a new role, this time of a   in real life. The Oggarane actress will be a part of The   in Mumbai, where she will address students about peace. The workshop, she says, addresses seven peace ideals, such as gratitude, forgiveness, love, humility, giving, patience and truth. “This will take place sometime in April and I will be talking to students about these ideals. The idea behind this is not to fight for activism or protesting, but spreading joy in a peaceful, non-preachy manner. Today, the world has begun to romanticize bad things and discussing them has become a sort of a hobby. Nothing worries people any more and they have forgotten to look at the nice things. I intend to make people sit up and take notice of nice things, get people to discuss them and also spread joy in this manner as a peace ambassador,” says Samyukta, who is currently busy with projects like   and Dayavittu Gamanisi.   will also be part of another campaign soon, for which she will team up with wildlife activists to help refurbish the ecosystem, especially birds, around Yediyur Lake.
