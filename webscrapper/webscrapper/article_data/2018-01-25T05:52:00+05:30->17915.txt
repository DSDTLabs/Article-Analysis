 Chennai: The AIADMK faction led by T T V Dhinakaran on Wednesday accused the ruling dispensation of going against the vision of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, and abandoning her poll promise of total prohibition in a phased manner. 
 
 Dr Namadhu MGR, the party organ now in the control of Sasikala clan, in an article, pointed to the party’s electoral manifesto released by the leader ahead of 2016 polls. “Shattering the dreams of Jayalalithaa for total prohibition in the state, the Edappadi government is getting happy by pushing Tamil womenfolk to tears,” the paper said. It alleged that the state had not opened any rehabilitation centre as promised in the manifesto, despite the lapse of two years of the government assuming charge. Instead, the state government opened outlets in every street and along the highways, besides fixing target for revenue during festive seasons.
 
 The party organ said one of the first signatures of Jayalalithaa after her consecutive win in assembly polls was to shut down 500 Tasmac outlets, however, the chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, the “symbols of betrayal” had no concerns for people’s welfare.
