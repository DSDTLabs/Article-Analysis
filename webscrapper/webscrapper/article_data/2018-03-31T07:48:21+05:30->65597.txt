MYSURU: "Unlike me,   voters will not commit a mistake,"   national president   said here on Friday, virtually admitting to his gaffe earlier this week. 

 
 At a press conference in Davangere on Tuesday, Shah, in a slip of the tongue, had said, "Recently, a retired   judge said if ever there was a competition for the most corrupt government, then the Yeddyurappa government will get number one..." 
 
 Shah had corrected himself when the gaffe was pointed out to him and he said he meant Karnataka CM   and not BJP leader Yeddyurappa. Seeking to make amends, Shah said while addressing the Navashakti convention here, "I committed a mistake at Davangere and my political opponents, including Rahul Gandhi and Siddaramaiah, used it to mock me. They said Shah has spoken the truth. But unlike me, people of Karnataka will not commit the mistake."
 
 Shah said   has become synonymous with corruption and violence. "The JD(S) doesn't have the strength to take on Congress. It is BJP which has the wherewithal to fight a corrupt Congress," he said.
