JAISALMER: Rajasthan   Jodhpur bench comprising Justice   and Justice Virendra Kumar Mathur have accepted a petition asking Kashmir DGP and Kupwara SP to help Barmer police locate a   girl in a Love Jihad case on Friday. The girl, identified as Ritu Khandelwal, had gone missing a month ago from Barmer when a Kashmiri youth convinced her to convert to Islam and took her to Kashmir.

 Khandelwalâ€™s family along with Barmer police, had filed an amendment petition on Friday which the high court bench accepted. In this petition it has been requested to ask DGP   and SP Kupwara to help in searching the woman and order is awaited in this regard.
 
 The family members of the girl have expressed possibility of her being caught in the trap of some terrorists because the youth she eloped with was an admirer of terrorist Burhan Wani and has many photographs with militants on his social media account.
 
 Barmer SP Gagandeep Singla said that a team has been sent to Kupwara for the third time which, with the help of local police, will try to get the statement of the woman under section 164.
