GANDHINAGAR: After a month of political bickering the BJP and Congress broke into   one day before the end of the first budget session of the 14th Assembly, on Tuesday. There was a rare show of understanding with between the two parties. The Congress withdrew its   against the speaker, Rajendra Trivedi, while the BJP withdrew its proposal to suspend three Congress MLAs (two for three years and one for one year). 

 After chief minister Vijay Rupani and leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani reached an agreement outside the house, both parties stepped away from their posturing. 
 
 Paresh Dhanani first proposed that his deputy, Shailesh Parmar, withdraw the no-confidence motion against the speaker. Dhanani said, “To maintain the traditions of the house, the Congress has decided to withdraw the no-confidence motion and hopes that such a situation never arises in the future.”
 
 The house then supported Parmar’s proposal unanimously. 
 
 Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel and other BJP leaders welcomed the Congress’s move.
 
 Nitin Patel then proposed to reduce the three-year suspension period of Congress MLAs Pratap Dudhat and Amrish Der and the one-year period of Baldevji Thakor to suspension till the end of the current budget session. 
 
 Patel said, “The leader of opposition Pareshbhai and others have express regret about the incident and we believe it (violent conduct) may have come at a weak moment. Our MLA Jagdish Panchal never used unparliamentary words in the house. However, after considering the CM’s appeal, all members have agreed to reduce the suspension term of three MLAs from three years and one year to the end of the budget session, that is till the 28th”
 
 Dhanani and Congress members then voiced appreciation of this gesture by the treasury benches.
