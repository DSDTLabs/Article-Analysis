MANA ( ): Home minister Rajnath   on Friday said India and China needed to have a “structural dialogue” to deal with situations like  .

 After interacting with   jawans at Mana, the last village before the Mana Pass close to the India-China border, Singh said there was a difference of perception between the two countries about the border and it would be resolved with time.
 
 “We don’t need to get into confrontation with China at the border and such disputes will be sorted out with a positive approach,” he said.
 
 India and China were recently embroiled in a two-month standoff in Doklam on the India-China-Bhutan trijunction.
 
 Mana, which Singh visited on Friday, is located at a height of 10,357 feet where ITBP men secure the border in harsh weather conditions with the temperature at times dropping to -17 degrees Celsius. Boosting the morale of ITBP troops, Singh told them the government was proud of them and was working towards resolving their operational problems like creating motorable roads to all border outposts, improving infrastructure, purchasing modern equipment and providing all-terrain vehicles that can run on snow and mountain rocks.
 
 Expressing displeasure at the slow rate of promotion in ITBP, Singh assured officers and jawans that they would be given adequate promotions in time. Singh also told ITBP troops that they would soon be provided light clothing (jackets etc) that could withstand high altitude temperatures. At present, the clothing provided to ITBP personnel is heavy and acts as an impediment in carrying out their work.
 
 While addressing the troops, Singh appreciated their work and said, “You are playing a multi-dimensional role, be it on the India-China border or fighting insurgency in the north-east, carrying out anti-Naxal operations or during natural disasters.
 
 And you are doing it all with passion.”
