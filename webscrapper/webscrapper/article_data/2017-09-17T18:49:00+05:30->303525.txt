Nagpur: IG, state anti-Naxal operation cell, Sharad Shelar, said on Saturday that rebels are fast growing their tentacles through their front organizations in the parts other than their jungle terrains to create mass base. 

 Shelar was addressing cops of Naxal-cell from different districts and commissionerates across the state assembled at the Unconventional Operations Training Centre (UOTC) at Suraburdi. 
 
 Shelar said that the  , walking on the path of Mao's ideology, have nothing to do with the benefits or betterment of the masses but had been making inroads into the society depending on the dissenting fragments of the population. The IG also cautioned stating that the rebels have prepared support base and spreading networks in metros too. 
 
 Shelar, asking the Naxal-cell cops to be alert, stated that the time has come to thwart the rebels' spreading influence strategically in all sectors as they can be detrimental to the democratic fabric of the country. The rebels are trying to capitalize on the disgruntled elements to sabotage the democracy and society for their own vested interest, Shelar added. He also stressed upon the fact that the focus on their activities should get due importance just as much as cops have been focusing on the law and order. 
 
 Apart from Shelar, Deputy SP of ANO Sanjiv Mhaisekar too was present during the address.
