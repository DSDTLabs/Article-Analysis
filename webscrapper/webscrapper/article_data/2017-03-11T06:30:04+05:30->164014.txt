NAGPUR: To make parents aware about the child rights and help children safeguard their own rights, Indian Academy of   (IAP) have initiated a yearlong awareness campaign.

 IAP president Dr   said, “In the first step, the academy has planned to put child rights on display at all the paediatrician’s office. Many times even parents are not aware about what their children are entitled to.”
 
 She told TOI, “About 310 paediatricians of Nagpur are our members. We will go to all 310 offices and make sure the child rights enlisted by   (UN) are put on display for awareness of children and their parents.”
 
 “For instance; right to grow up in right environment and right to education. Though the education has been made cheaper by the government, many girls in the state periphery are still not being sent to schools. Hence, we have to go long way in this regard,” Dr   said.
 
 IAP also plans to reach out to schools and counsel students. She said, “We are frequently called by schools for health check-up of students. We will use the opportunity to impart knowledge about rights among girls and boys separately on the issues like how their body grows, how they can keep themselves safe, about the forms of abuse like sexual, mental as well as physical. There will be separate sessions for girls, boys, as well as teachers.”
 
 The wing will be working on the issues like nurturing the girl child, adolescent nutrition & anaemia, common skin and hair problems, life skills & legal issues, menstrual health and hygiene, and preventing teenage marriages and pregnancy, the IAP president said.
 
 Dr Mujawar said, “We will also focus on male children. It won’t be wrong to say that male child is equally abused but it mostly goes neglected.”
