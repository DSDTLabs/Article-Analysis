GURGAON: Even though 83 water bodies were sanctioned for   in 2014, nothing has been done on the ground till date, a response to an RTI query has revealed. Experts say the dry months — from January to April — are the best time to desilt   for   to rejuvenate these water bodies by summer.

 According to the RTI response, though over   was sanctioned for desilting of 83 ponds in 2014, not even a single pond has been desilted yet. It has also revealed that even the process of desilting has not yet started and the sanctioned amount is still lying  .
 
 The district has over 400 ponds, out of which 208 have dried up. Some 186 ponds are dirty and 52 are clean. In 2014, the authorities finally came up with a plan to desilt 83 ponds in villages to start with.
 
 “The money sanctioned by the government has not been used on desilting of ponds at all. The authorities talk about making new artificial water bodies, but they have not been able to revive the existing natural water bodies,” Aseem Takyar, who had filed the RTI, told TOI on Thursday. 
 
 Greens say January to April is the best time to start desilting of waterbodies so that it leads to groundwater recharge by summer. “As ponds are not cleaned for years and continuously used for immersion of idols and loose soil from construction sites, desilting of ponds is important and it’s the ideal time to do the work,” said Kuldeep Yadav, an activist.
 
 MCG commissioner TL Satyaprakash said, “It will take some time, but we will definitely look into the matter and start the desilting work as early as possible.”
