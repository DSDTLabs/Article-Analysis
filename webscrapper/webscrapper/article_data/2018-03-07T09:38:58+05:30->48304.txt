PATIALA: India’s premier sprinters,   and Jisna Mathews’ no show at the Federation Cup senior national athletics meet has compounded the Athletics Federation of India’s ( ) misery, which is already struggling to pick the best athletes for the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games after having set seriously stiff qualification criteria to make the CWG grade.

 
 Tintu and Jisna, who are legendary sprinter PT Usha’s protégés, pulled out for different reasons, adding to the long list of notable absentees at the event. With  ,  , Lalita Babar already skipping the event, Tintu and Jisna’s pullout has taken away the sheen from the prestigious meet. All these athletes will not be considered for selection in the CWG squad.
 
 The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has allocated 37 slots to Indian athletics for the CWG, but with star power missing and most of the other top athletes finding it very tough to breach the AFI’s qualification mark or come anywhere close to it, the task of sending its best athletics contingent to Gold Coast has become all the more difficult for the federation.
 
 National record holder half-miler Tintu was expected to participate in the 800m at the meet, while the 2016 Asian junior athletics championships gold medallist Jisna was to run in the 400m and 4x400m.
 
 AFI secretary general C K Valson told TOI that their coach Usha, in a recent communication, informed the federation that both will be skipping the event to focus on the Asian Games, a decision that hasn’t gone down well with the federation.
 
 “Tintu suffered two severe bouts of dengue fever and she is recovering from that. She had recovered from the first bout and was expected to participate in the Federation Cup. But recently, the dengue fever hit back. She is doing fine now. Usha informed us that she doesn’t want to take any chances with Tintu’s health,” Valson said.
 
 “As far as Jisna’s pullout is concerned, Usha said her priority is not the CWG.”
