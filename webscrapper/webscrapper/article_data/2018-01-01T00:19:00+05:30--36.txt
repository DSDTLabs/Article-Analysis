Trichy: Criticising the Trichy City Corporation for not providing adequate time to express their views and objections over the proposed re-demarcation of 65 wards in the city, CPI has asked the civic body to extend the deadline for expressing the views of political outfits. As the deadline for rendering grievances in delimitation of Trichy Corporation was fixed on January 2, 2018, CPI has sought the period to be extended until January 31, 2018. “No accessible opportunity was provided either to the public or to the recognised political parties to go through the delimitation made in city corporation limits. The re-demarcated boundaries of civic bodies should have been made available online for the political parties and ward representatives to access the changes made but no such facility was provided,” K Suresh, district secretary, CPI said.
