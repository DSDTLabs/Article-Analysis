SHILLONG: Members of the   (MPCC) will 'gherao' the office of the   (RBI) here on Wednesday as a   against demonetisation. 

 Speaking to the media after a meeting chaired by the All India Congress Commitee coordinator in charge of Meghalaya, Takam Sanjoy, here on Tuesday, chief minister   said, "The RBI's integrity has been diluted (by PM Modi)." The party alleged that the RBI had failed to perform its statutory duty towards the citizens of the country and had instead become a symbol of government interference in the running of statutory and constitutional bodies.
 
 "The RBI is becoming vulnerable to corruption otherwise why would its officials be arrested?" Sanjoy said, referring to the recent arrest of RBI officials for alleged involvement in conversion of demonetised currency.
