NEW DELHI: Two British nationals were arrested for allegedly   and misbehaving with an airhostess on an Air India flight from London to Delhi on Friday. According to the police, the two were drunk and prompted airline officials to file a complaint as soon as the flight landed. 

 The two men were escorted to the   and a case under section 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) was registered against the two. The British High Commission was also informed of the incident.
 
 The accused have been identified as Jaspaal Singh and Charandeep Khaira, who were visiting India to attend a wedding in Jaipur, police officials said. The two men were arrested, but later released on bail. The incident took place at around 11am on flight   112.
 
 “The breath analysis of the two confirmed they were drunk. The men had reportedly been drinking and asked the airhostess to bring some eatables. However, they started passing lewd comments and hurling abuses at the airhostess for not bringing it on time and created a scene, which caused the airlines to file a complaint,” said Sanjay Bhatia, DCP (IGI) airport.
 
 The incident took place just a week after   MP   hit an Air India staffer close to 25 times with a slipper, following which the MP was barred from flying with the airlines. 
 
 An Air India spokesperson said, “The crew reported the matter to the security agencies, following which the Delhi Police registered a case against the two passengers. Air India is also carrying its probe and the incident is condemned. At the same time we urge our passengers to draw a line of ethics while flying and using our services so that it does not cause inconvenience to the airline, supporting staff or our valued travelers.”
