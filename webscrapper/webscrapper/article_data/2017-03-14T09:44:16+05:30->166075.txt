AURANGABAD: A section of teachers associated with Aurangabad   is up in arms against the state health department over alleged delay in clearing medical reimbursement bills.

 “The speed of clearing files for medical reimbursement is very poor at the district level. The files are kept pending for frivolous queries and the delay affects teachers in many ways,” claimed Rajesh Hiwale, spokesperson of the   of   associated with  .
 
 Hiwale said many teachers borrow money for medical treatment and cannot repay in time due to the alleged delay. 
 
 Teachers body claimed that around 25 to 30 files for medical reimbursement reach district health authorities every month. Aurangabad district has more than 2,000 ZP run schools with more than 12,000 teachers. “The claims are far less as compared to 12,000 potential claimants. It is a matter of worry if teachers are made to wait endlessly,” a teacher said. 
 
 Teachers have also demanded defining and publishing the standard procedure for claiming bills towards medical reimbursement.“There is little awareness what the official procedure to be followed when file is put up for medical reimbursement. The health department should spell out the procedures and give it wide publicity,” Hiwale said.
 
 District health officer Baliram Jamadar said he did not have off hand information about pendency of such claims. “I do not agree with the teachers that there is huge pendency. However, I need to check the statistics,” he said.
