CHANDIGARH: The   Legislature Party ( ) on Monday decided to aggressively take on SAD and AAP on the floor of the House during the ongoing budget session of the Punjab assembly. There was unanimity over the need to use social media more aggressively to counter rivals.

 At the meeting convened by chief minister Amarinder Singh, the MLAs decided to expose the Akalis for “unleashing a false propaganda campaign” against the state government on various issues. Asking party MLAs to go all out to ‘expose’ the Akalis on the floor of the House, Amarinder reiterated his stand that his government will not indulge in any political vendetta. He directed the members to use the government’s achievements, of which they were provided a list at the CLP meeting, to counter the Opposition. The members should, in particular, highlight the clean governance provided to Punjab by the Congress government, he added.
 
 Amarinder also instructed the members to ensure proper coordination to take on the Opposition in the House. The meeting discussed ways for smooth floor management in order to protect the sanctity of the House and also ensure that the taxpayers’ money is not allowed to be wasted by a disruptive Opposition. A suggestion was mooted by some members to compare the first year of Ccongress government with the first year of the erstwhile SAD-BJP government.
