AHMEDABAD: Shailesh Bhatt, the victim in Rs 12 crore Bitcoin extortion case, on Tuesday identified three accused from a line-up, including two police constables, in the presence of the mamlatdar of Gandhinagar district.

  DGP Shivanand Jha issued suspension orders for the two constables and asked them not to leave Ahmedabad district without informing the Ahmedabad city police commissioner. The duo has been transferred to Ahmedabad city police headquarters for the duration of the investigation.
 
 CID (crime) was awarded five-day custodial interrogation of three accused —   and  , constables with Amreli police, and Ketan Patel, a Surat-based lawyer.
 
 “The trio is being questioned on various aspects of the case. While the constables were asked about when they learned of the conspiracy to abduct two Surat-based businessmen and taken to a farmhouse near Dehgam, Patel holds the key to understanding the role of Anant Patel, the inspector of Amreli LCB. Ketan Patel had identified himself to the victims as Iqbal and had demanded Rs 32 crore for their release. He claims he had come on angadia business, but it doesn’t seem plausible,” said a CID (crime) official.
 
 Officials said they are watching the movements of the other accused. Officials say they thing the policemen, including Anant Patel, are trying to secure anticipatory bail. Officials added that unless Patel is apprehended, precise details of the incident – involving bitcoins worth Rs 12 crore, hawala transactions of Rs 32 crore and a cash transaction of Rs 67 lakh – will be clear.
