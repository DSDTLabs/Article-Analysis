GHAZIABAD: A 19-year-old youth studying in Class XII was allegedly robbed of his SUV and assaulted by two unidentified armed men in Ghaziabad on Friday night.

 The robbers also stole the mobile phone, wallet and a gold chain of Ashish, a student of Adarsh Inter-College, before they dumped him on a road.
 
  Ashish was allegedly taken hostage outside Kiran Farm House in Banthala where he had gone to attend the wedding of his cousin. He left his car in a parking lot near the farmhouse. Around midnight, Ashish returned to the Scorpio in the parking lot to drive back to his home in Tila Shahbazpur.
 
 According to police, Ashish had gone for the function with some of his women members of his family.
 
 SHO, Loni police station, Umesh Kumar Pandey said, “Ashish walked up to the SUV alone. As soon as he got inside the vehicle, he found two men hiding inside it who had sneaking inside when he had left it alone. The men forced him to drive towards Bhopura. They hit his head with the butt of a revolver, thereby injuring him. At Bhopura, they dumped him on the roadside and fled with the SUV and other valuables. It all happened in less than 20 minutes. We haven’t been able to trace the robbers so far.” Ashish was not available for comments despite repeated attempts to contact him.

 An FIR has been registered at Loni police station against unidentified persons under IPC section 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death) on the basis of a complaint registered by Ashish.
