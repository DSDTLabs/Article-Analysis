PUNE: The   enrolment drive in the district is set for a major boost with the state government allowing e-seva kendras to be part of the process on Tuesday.

 The e-seva kendras will operate from same places as other enrolments agencies. They will be provided with separate Aadhaar kits. Presently, the Pune district has a 91% Aadhaar coverage.
 
 The enrolments service by e-seva kendras has started at 38 locations in the city on Tuesday, district collector   said.
 
 After the state government de-listed the agency, CSE-SPV, and their operators,   was given the complete responsibility of Aadhaar drive in the districts. However, crunch of trained staff posed a huge challenge for Mahaonline.“We told the state IT department about the issues we were facing, following which it was decided that the existing e-seva kendras along with SETU kendras will be re-designated as government-run kendras for the enrolment process. The service is already offered at ward offices and other tehsil offices,” the collector said.
 
 As per the latest directive of the Centre, the e-seva kendras can continue to operate. “There will be Aadhaar kits at 15 ward offices in the   areas and six ward offices in the PCMC limits to cover the remaining population not in the Aadhaar net,” the collector said. The pre-condition of the operator to give a bank guarantee of Rs 50,000 has been waived, he added.
 
 On the issue of delisting of CSE-SPV and their operators, the collector said, there were several complaints against the operator. “The government took cognizance of the complaints like charging for the service and stopped all private agencies involved in the process while asking them to operate from government premises only. The agencies have now been allowed to operate at the respective locations and ward offices,” the collector said.
