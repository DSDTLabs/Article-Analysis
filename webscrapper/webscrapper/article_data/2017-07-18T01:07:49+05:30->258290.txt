MUMBAI: The Bombay   on Monday told the state government to clarify its classification of   as an  . It also asked if a 5-year-old can participate in an adventure sport.

 A bench of Justices Rajendra Savant and Sadhana Jadhav posed these queries when a contempt petition on violations during dahi handi last year came up for hearing. It sought action against MLA Ashish Shelar, who is also BJP’s Mumbai chief.
 
 The judges noted that the Supreme Court is hearing the state’s appeal against the HC’s August 11, 2014, order that directed the height of human pyramids be restricted to 20 feet or four tiers. The HC’s order was passed on a PIL by activist Swati Patil, who also sought action against organisers for injuries and casualties.
 
 The judges referred to the August 11, 2015, government resolution which termed dahi handi as an adventure sport and asked if it had issued any further GR. “You will have to clarify before us what is the meaning of ‘sahasi krida’ (adventure sport). Is dahi handi an adventure sport? Whether the order will be flouted under the garb of adventure,” asked Justice Jadhav. The judges said they also want to know from the state if children can participate in an adventure sport. “Whether adventure sport will cover a 5-year-child standing at 20 feet? Whether he will even participate in an adventure sport?” asked Justice Jadhav.
 
 Patil’s advocate Nitesh Nevshe said Shelar is chairperson of the dahi handi committee set up by the government. “Think before you (Shelar) go to inaugurate such functions,’’ said Justice Jadhav. Since the SC is slated to hear the appeal on August 1, the judges adjourned the hearing to August 4.
