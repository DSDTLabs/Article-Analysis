With the shooting of the Vishnu Manchu-starrer ' ' slated to begin from this Friday, director   says, “This is the third time I’m collaborating with Vishnu after Dhenikaina Ready and Eedo Rakam Aado Rakam, and I’m confident that this film will turn out to be a milestone for both of us.”
Touted to be a ‘comic caper with a dash of romance’, the film has   playing the female lead. Talking about the film’s plot, the director says, “Pragya Jaiswal plays an NRI who happens to be the granddaughter of Kota Srinivasa Rao. Vishnu and   play two acharis who’ve never set foot outside India. But they set out to America to save Pragya from an imminent danger. That is the crux of the film.”
 The filmmaker has roped in an array of comedians for the movie. “Prithvi and LB Sreeram play a funny father and son duo that will crack up the audience with their comic chemistry. We also have Prabhas Sreenu and Brahmanandam playing a guru and sishya who will leave the audience in splits with their funny repartee. It’s going to be a laugh riot from start to finish,” says Nageswara Reddy.
