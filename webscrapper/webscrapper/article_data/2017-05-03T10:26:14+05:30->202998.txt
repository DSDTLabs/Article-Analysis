NEW DELHI: Chairman of the   (CoA),  , is not amused by the decision of   to send a notice to  . "My advice to them was that   isn't an ordinary contract. It's a policy decision which covers eight years and it will bind future generation of office-bearers. I have advised them that major policy decision must be taken only by SGM (on May 7)," Rai told TOI.

 Later, CoA also sent a letter to BCCI saying the board would need the permission of the committee in order to communicate with ICC. "All letters, notices and other correspondence on behalf of the BCCI which seek to invoke or exercise any rights/remedies under the MPA entered into between the BCCI and the   shall only be issued with the prior approval of the CoA," the letter to the board official said.
 
 Meanwhile, a top board functionary told TOI that the decision to pull out of the Champions Trophy will need at least 15 votes to pass a resolution.
 
 "We are not a financial institution that we have to talk about money all the time. Cricket should be our prime concern and nothing else. The BCCI is for cricket and our team playing in Champions Trophy should be the main concern of the SGM," the official said, giving a hint that the house is divided.
 
 Acting BCCI president   said the solution to the problem would only happen after the SGM. "It's a very important and sensitive issue and we have to thoroughly analyse it from all angles before taking a final call on this subject," Khanna added.
 
 Before the SGM, Rai will meet the BCCI members on May 5 and 6 and explain the pros and cons of the ICC's financial structure and also talk about how to implement the Lodha committee's reforms.
 
 "It doesn't look nice to be in a confrontational mood all the time. We have to ensure that it is a win-win situation for all the stakeholders," another BCCI official said while adding that pulling out of the Champions Trophy isn't the only issue here. If India pulls out of the event, it would mean cutting all links with ICC.
