One of the most anticipated Hollywood films of the year,   is the last in the   series. But that’s not the only reason why you shouldn’t miss this Hugh Jackman-starrer helmed by   that releases this Friday. 

 To begin with, Hugh Jackman’s 'Wolverine' — his screen name is Logan — has always been the most popular mutant on the 'X-Men' roster. While the actor has owned the role in all the outings, this time around, we get to see more of his emotional side. 
 
 Logan will see X23, who, over the years, has become one of the most exciting characters. She is very distinct from her ‘father’, Wolverine. And with some other new mutants also debuting in this film, it will mark the beginning of a new era. 
 
 That’s not all. For years now, fans have been asking for an R-rated 'Wolverine' film so that they can see their favourite mutant without a PG-13 rating. Their wish has finally been granted. There’s more. The movie will see Sir   returning as Professor X, which is one of his most iconic roles. 
 And, while most of the talk has been about this being Jackman’s last 'X-Men' outing, it’s also Stewart’s last time as the Professor. Last but not the least, it’s reportedly the best-reviewed superhero film so far.
