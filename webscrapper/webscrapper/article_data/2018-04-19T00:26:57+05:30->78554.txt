Indore: Clash between civic body staff and residents of Bhuri Tekri area that was reported on Tuesday has raised questions over Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) removal drives that it has been carrying out across the city for different proposed development projects. 

 Fourteen people including eight residents and six IMC staff were injured in the clash that was reported on Tuesday afternoon. Some even sustained serious injuries on their head and back. 
 
 While IMC officials claimed that they had gone to remove vacant structures, residents alleged that IMC bouncers thrashed them. They did not even spare women and children. 
 
 “They did not give us any notice prior to the action. And when we asked for the same, they started threatening us of dire consequence,” alleged Lakshmi Bai, one of the residents who were injured in the clash. 
 
 She alleged that as they opposed the drive, they started beating us without any reason. “They came in dozens of vehicles and stood in front of our colony,” she said, adding that most of the staff had sticks in hands which were used to thrash residents who raised objection. 
 
 The residents also raised question on why IMC did not take help of police during the drive. Residents said they were even threatened in the hospital by IMC staff. 
 
 The civic body has planned to remove houses from the area and provide them other houses under government schemes. However, residents claimed that most of them have been living in the area for over two decades and spent a lot of money on construction of their houses. 
 
 IMC’s commissioner Manish Singh said that the team had gone to remove vacant structures. “It was some anti-social elements of the area including women who started pelting stones on our staff. Officials had to use their staff in self-defence, during which some of them were injured,” he said. 
 
 Our staff sustained severe injuries in the stone pelting incident, Singh added.
