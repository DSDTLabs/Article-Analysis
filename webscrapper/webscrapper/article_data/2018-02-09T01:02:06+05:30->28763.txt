Tirupur: Three popular local cable TV channels in Tirupur were recently booked for telecasting new movies without obtaining rights. The Coimbatore unit of Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement had registered four such cases in last two years. 

 “Whenever movie producers lodge complaint against local TV channels for playing movies without having the rights, we have to act because it would easily make out a case under the copyright Act. We have booked four local TV channels including three in Coimbatore and one in Tirupur for the crimes, each two cases in 2016 and 2017,” said a senior official of the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement.
 
 But, in most of the cases, the producers would not push the cases once the channels concerned pay the desired amount. “For the producers, such cases are a tool to make some quick money,” said the official.
 
 Sources said following the registration of the three cases, local TV channels in Tirupur and Coimbatore districts that had telecast new movies without permission, agreed to make payments to avoid legal complications.
