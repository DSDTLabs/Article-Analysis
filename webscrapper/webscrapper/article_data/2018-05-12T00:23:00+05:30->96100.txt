 Pimpri Chinchwad: The civic body has urged the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) to change the alignment of the Pimpri-Swargate route to ensure it doesn’t block the bus rapid transit system (BRTS) corridor in Pimpri.
 
 MahaMetro had begun constructing the 15km Pimpri-Swargate Metro route last year. To facilitate construction of the pillars, officials had removed the barricades from the dedicated BRTS corridor from Kharalwadi to Babasaheb Ambedkar chowk in Pimpri. 
 
 Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation says this construction work would hamper the plying of BRTS buses on the corridor.
 
 “PCMC wants to launch the BRTS bus service soon, so we have told MahaMetro to change the (Metro) alignment so that the pillars are not constructed in the corridor. We have told them to erect pillars along the service road instead. PCMC and MahaMetro officials conducted a joint inspection of the route from Kharalwadi to Morwadi,” municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar said. 
 
 “The Metro will run outside the grade separator from Kharalwadi to Morwadi. We have stopped constructing pillars at Kharalwadi, acting on the directives from PCMC, and are preparing an alignment review report. This report will be submitted in a week to the PCMC for approval,” said Gautam Birhade, chief project manager, MahaMetro. 
 
 “PCMC has not created a dedicated BRTS corridor from Ambedkar chowk to Finolex chowk, where we will leave one lane along the grade separator for BRTS buses and then construct pillars,” Birhade added.
