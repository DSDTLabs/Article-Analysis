NEW DELHI: In a case of  , a 26-year-old   was beaten up and then   multiple times by a group of four men near his house in   on Sunday night. 

 Chinmoy Biswal, additional deputy commissioner of police (south), said victim Prince Tewatia’s motorcycle brushed against a scooter in the Lado Sarai market. This led to an argument between Tewatia and the owner of the scooter. The latter, along with his friends, then attacked Tewathia, said police.
 
 Tewathia (26) is an executive of a private firm in Gurgaon. His father is a head constable with Delhi Police. Tewatia said he was heading for home, along with his friend, Paras, around 7.30pm. As soon as they reached a market place in Lado Sarai, which usually remains crowded on weekends, they found a group of men standing at a corner, with their scooters blocking the lane. 
 
 Tewatia stopped his bike and walked up to the men. “I asked them to remove their vehicles. But instead of doing so, they started arguing with me. I thought that the situation could worsen and hence, took another route to drop my friend,” Tewathia said.
 
 The victim’s brother, Mickey, said Tewatia had no clue that those men were following him. “They came on two scooters and intercepted my brother at a deserted spot when he was coming home after dropping Paras,” he said. 
 
 They first stabbed him twice in his thigh, police said. “Then they tried to stab me in my stomach, but I fought back. In the scuffle, I received stab wounds on my arm. When I fell down, they stabbed me in the back thrice,” Tewatia added. 
 
 The accused then fled the spot. One of the locals found him lying in a pool of blood and called police. Cops reached the spot and rushed Tewathia to AIIMS Trauma Center. He was discharged on Monday afternoon.
 
 “A case of attempt to murder has been registered. CCTV footage is being scanned to identify the attackers,” said Biswal.
