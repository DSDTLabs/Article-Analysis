Surat: An employee of an angadia firm was looted of diamonds worth Rs80 lakh by three armed persons at Laldarwaja area of the city on Friday. 

 The robbers, who had knives with them, stopped the angadia delivery man at 8.15 am when he was going on his scooter and looted the packets of diamonds of traders and polishers in Katargam and Gotalawadi from him.
