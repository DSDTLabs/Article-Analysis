In a unique initiative, acid attack   in Lucknow got an opportunity to get inked! In a workshop organised at Sheroes, a cafe run by   victims in Gomti Nagar, tattoo artist  , who came from Mumbai, made tattoos for several survivors, including the campaigners for the acid attack victims  . "The main motto of organizing this workshop is to spread awareness and support acid attack victims with job opportunities in this field. To let them know that they are not disabled even if they fall prey to such acts," said Laxmi, who got a tattoo denoting freedom made on her arms. 
During the workshop, Vikas, who was accompanied by a member of his team, taught the acid attack survivors of Sheroes different aspects of tattoo making – from how to make a tattoo, to how to use tattoo equipment and also safety measures that one has to take and more.   and   got a tattoo of their husband’s initials engraved on their hands. "I always felt that getting a tattoo was a painful job, but all thanks to Vikasji he made it possible. I’m getting my husband’s name engraved so that it stays with me forever," said Kavita.
