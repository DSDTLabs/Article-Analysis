NEW DELHI: Two months after the Union Cabinet approved the NCT of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Second (Amendment) Bill, 2017, to extend protection to illegal constructions in Delhi and prevent their demolition or sealing till December 31, 2020, the Supreme Court on Thursday decided to examine the validity of an Act which existed before it — the Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, 2006. 

 A bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta, which has recently revived sealing drive against unauthorised constructions in Delhi, said the case would be heard from April 2 on a day-to-day basis.
 
 The apex court had in April 2013 asked the Delhi high court to adjudicate validity of the law but the case remained pending in the HC for five years and the   on December 15 last year transferred the case to itself to take a final call on its validity.
 
 The bench is also examining the validity of Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) decision to amend the master plan to bring relief to traders who are facing the heat of the ongoing sealing drive. The move seems to be heading towards a roadblock with the court seeking an explanation from it along with the Delhi government and the municipal corporations on whether proper research or study was done by them on the impact of the amendment on environment and existing infrastructure of the city.
 
 The sealing drive of unauthorised constructions in Delhi was revived in the city in January after the SC allowed court-appointed monitoring committee to identify and seal illegal premises as the government authorities had failed to check building of such illegal structures.
 
 The apex court had in March 2006 ordered sealing of all unauthorised constructions in the city and appointed a monitoring committee. 
 
 The sealing drive went on till January 2012 when the court asked the committee not to proceed further. But the committee was asked to keep filing reports on the status of unauthorised constructions in the city.
