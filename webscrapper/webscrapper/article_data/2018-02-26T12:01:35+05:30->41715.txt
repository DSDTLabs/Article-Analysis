   will perhaps be remembered most for Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari, where her portrayal as a 'devakanya' who comes to the earth and refers to people as 'manava' was cherished by film lovers of all ages. 

 "Our 'Athilokasundari' has gone away at a young age. I learnt a lot from her. She was a dedicated actor. I have not seen such commitment from anyone. Her role with me in Jagadeka Veerudu Athiloka Sundari mesmerized all of us," Chiranjeevi said. He said the last time he met her was on his 60th birthday when Boney Kapoor and Sridevi came to wish him. 
 
 Actor Krishna recollected that as a child, Sridevi used to play in their house. Later they acted in 31 films together. "The news of her death came like an earthquake. She was such a beautiful actress," said actor-director Vijaya Nirmala. 
 
 Telangana chief minister   said Sridevi captivated cine-goers with her beauty, dancing and acting skills and earned countless number of fans. "It is unfortunate that Sridevi, who was still active in the film industry, died at a young age," he said. Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu said she carved a name for herself with her performances.
 
 Director  , who directed some of Sridevi's big hits, expressed shock at her demise. Director   too condoled her death, describing her as the 'first lady superstar of the country'.
 
  The temple city of Tirupati mourned the sudden demise of actress Sridevi on Sunday. The actress often used to visit Tirupati to spend her holidays at her maternal aunt Anasuyamma's house. Anasuyamma and her sister Rama Subbayamma broke into tears after they came to know of her death . "Sridevi grew in my home for a few years and we were very affectionate. We used to stay for 10-15 days in Sridevi's house in Mumbai. She regularly visited our house. We miss our daughter," Anasuyamma said. Rama Subbayamma said they last met her at Renigunta Airport in August 2017. tnn
