A picture speaks a thousand words and even more if your circumference is more than those around you. Vidit Mantri saw his engagement pictures and he knew he had to do something about his century crossing weight. With NO gymming and a super healthy diet, Vidit lost 28 kilos in 5 months! Unbelievable? Wait till you read his story!

  I got the motivation to lose weight only after I saw my engagement pictures. 
 
 
 
 
 Boiled eggs, a glass of milk and fruits with fibre
 
 
  Grilled chicken or fish with sautéed vegetables
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fruits and boiled vegetables
 
 
  (but only a slice or two)
 
 
 My workout involves 15-20 km of walking every day.
 
 
 Grilled chicken and vegetables with seasoning. Or you can pan fry chicken with olive oil and then glaze with white wine.
 
 
 I always thought workouts were more effective than a healthy diet. But it’s the other way round.
 
 
 It has to be through my fiancé. She’s a health and fitness instructor. This always keeps me on my toes.
 
 
  You should compare how you feel pre- and post- your weight loss. And there is a drastic change in that feeling. Once you’ve experienced that, there’s no going back. If you look better, you feel better. That’s what ensured I did not lose focus. 
 
 
  I think the most difficult part is getting tired way too soon. You also lose a bit of self-confidence.
 
 
 I have never wanted a six-pack body. Keeping fit is the ultimate goal and that’s where I see myself 10 years down the line.
 
 
 I stuck to the golden rule of no fast food or cold drinks. Cutting down on alcohol also helped a great deal. 
 
 
 My lowest point was when I saw myself losing control. This was my lowest point in my journey.
 
 
 When you’re on your journey of losing weight, you’re inspiring people around you to do the same.
