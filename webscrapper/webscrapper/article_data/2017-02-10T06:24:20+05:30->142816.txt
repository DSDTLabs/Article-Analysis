MANGALURU: The Moodushedde Badriya Juma Masjid masjid in the city's outskirts has asked its community members to refrain from playing DJ music, singing or dancing during marriages, circumcision ceremonies and other functions. 

  The   committee has decided not to send khateebs (religious leaders) and ustaads to functions if rules are violated. The resolution declaring dance and music un-Islamic was passed at a meeting on November 23. 
 
  Masjid general secretary   told TOI the resolution was passed after a youth from the area made a request seeking ban on music and dance at events. "The area has about 160 Muslim families, which have hailed the decision. We've no objection if families hold Islamic cultural programmes like burda and mappilapattu during functions," he said. 
 
 Muneer Katipalla, state president of  , said the move is against Indian laws.
