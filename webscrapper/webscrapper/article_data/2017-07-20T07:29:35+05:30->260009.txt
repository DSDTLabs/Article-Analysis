AHMEDABAD: On Wednesday, the local people and an 181 Abhayam team rescued a 23-year-old woman who was all set to jump into the   to end her life. 

 Abhayam officials said they had received a phone call alerting them about a woman who was going to commit suicide by jumping off Subhash bridge. She was carrying a nine-month-old infant, the phone caller said.
 
 Sources said that local people had grabbed the woman just in time and had brought her down from the bridge. She was extremely distraught.
 
 “The woman said that she had married two years ago,” an Abhayam official said. “She said that initially she was harassed by her in-laws but her husband too had started abusing and beating her. He would drink and beat her accusing her all the time of having an extra-marital affair,” an official said.
 
 The woman said that she had decided to end her life after a bout of quarrel with her husband early that morning. She decided to drown with her child as she did not trust leaving her with her in-laws.
 
 The Abhayam 181 team counselled her and took her to her parents’ house in  . 
 
 “The shocked parents said they had no inkling that their daughter was undergoing so much torture,” an 181 Abhayam police official said. 
 
 “We asked the woman is she wished to press any charges but she declined. She was left in the custody of her parents who have assured us that they will take good care of her and not pressurize her to return to her in-laws place against her will,” said an Abhayam official.
