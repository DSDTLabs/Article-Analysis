CHANDIGARH: Giving relief to 21 doctors of  , the Chandigarh bench of   (CAT) set aside an order of the premier health institute.

 The tribunal has directed PGIMER to provide pensionrelated benefits to the 21 doctors. The institute had refused to provide them General Provident Fund ( ) and Old Pension Scheme benefits existing prior to January 1, 2004, via orders dated October 10, 2017, and November 15, 2013, which stand quashed.
 
 The tribunal observed, “…for the purpose of pensionary benefits, the qualifying service of the applicants shall commence from the date they took charge of the posts to which they were first appointed”, in temporary capacity, as that temporary service was followed, without interruption, by substantive permanent appointments in the same service/posts, as per Rule 13 (Chapter III) of the   (Pension) Rules, 1972 As per the petition, the 21 doctors were appointed by way of an open advertisement “by wrongly using the nomenclature of adhoc”. They were selected as assistant professors between 1996 and 2003. Later, PGI advertised for the same posts on regular basis, which the candidates applied for and were selected as well. They continued working, as such, uninterrupted without any break and got promotions as associate professors, additional professors, and even reached the status of professors. Their clinical duties were exactly the same as regular faculty. In this manner, they were fully covered under the GPF-cum-Old Pension Scheme, but the competent authority wrongly treated them as freshly appointed doctors, after their regular appointments, said the petition.
 
 They approached the authorities for redressal of their grievance and the case was recommended by the director to be put up before the governing body, vide a letter dated January 21, 2010, and a sub-committee was constituted by the Union ministry of health in April 2011. The governing body approved the recommendations which were in favour of applicants on April 28, 2004.
 
 However, the issue was again taken up by the body and the ministry, by ignoring its earlier recommendations, declined the claims of the applicants vide a letter dated December 14, 2013. The doctors again made representations on January 9, 2014, and June 14, 2014, but in vain. Their claim was declined vide orders dated October 12, 2017, November 15, 2013, and August 12, 2014, by the competent authority. PGIMER, in its reply, pleaded that the applicants were appointed on adhoc basis during the period 1996-2003.
 
 However, their regular appointments were made in pursuance of a fresh advertisement, on substantive vacant posts by the Department, after January 1, 2004. It was submitted that prior to 2004, GPF-cum-Old Pension Scheme was applicable, which had been replaced by the Government of India, with effect from January 1, 2004, by introducing New Pension Scheme.
