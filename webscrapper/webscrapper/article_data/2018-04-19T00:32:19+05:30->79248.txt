Coimbatore: Tamil language and culture are under threat in the present AIADMK government, said former Union minister A Raja on Wednesday. He was speaking at a public gathering in the city. Raja said the AIADMK government had cheated Tamil people in crucial issues such as NEET and Cauvery. “Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has said the DMK has not done anything to ensure Tamil Nadu’s rights in the Cauvery issue. But it was Kalaignar (Karunanidhi) who was instrumental in forming a committee to solve the dispute and also getting an interim relief for the state. But when DMK was not in power, the AIADMK got it published in the gazette and received the credit for it,” he said. Speaking about NEET, he said the test was against the rights of students from backward classes. “The state assembly passed a resolution against NEET and sent it to the President. It was the opinion of the whole Tamil population. But the President’s office replied that it had not received any resolution from Tamil Nadu. This shows how inefficient the AIADMK government is,” Raja said. He added that the BJP has been acting in such a way as to claim that the country was a Hindu country. “This amounts to depriving the rights of minorities,” he said. Raja also criticized the state’s move to construct a memorial for former chief minister J Jayalalithaa.  “The EPS-OPS government has not taken up to work for issues that matter to Tamil people, but are intent only in building a memorial for Jayalalithaa using Rs 47 crore of public money,” he said.
