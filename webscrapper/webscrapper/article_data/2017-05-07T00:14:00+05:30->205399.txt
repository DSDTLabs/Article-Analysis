Bhopal: Villagers in Madhya Pradesh will soon get tap connections at their home. In the first phase, close to 1,000 big villages with a source of water in their boundaries would be identified and the work to lay the pipeline network will begin.

 Public health and engineering department is set to bring in a circular within a week for the purpose. The departmentâ€™s principal secretary, Manoj Govil, said at least three villages would be selected from each block of the state for the supply  . Efforts would be made to complete the work within a year.
 
 There are over 300 blocks in Madhya Pradesh. Officials said once the circular is issued, survey of the villages will be done to identify the source for water supply. The work is expected to start at ground level by October and is expected to end by the summer of next year.
 
 Officials said the total cost of the project would be calculated after identifying the villages as expenses would differ from village to village on the basis of prevailing infrastructure.
 
 However, the facility of getting piped water at their doorsteps would not come for free. The villagers will be charged at least Rs 60 for it by the respective gram panchayats.
 
 Infrastructure work for the purpose would be done by private contractors, but in order to fix the accountability it would be ensured that one contractor does the entire work in a village, officials said, adding that the contractor will also be responsible for the operation and maintenance after completion of the work.
 
 There are thousands of villages in MP that do not have piped water. Villagers have to travel long distances under the boiling sun to get a bucket of water.
 
 Officials said the objective is to cover the villages with a source of ground water in the first phase, as the cost of supplying piped water in villages without a water source would be huge and even might not be feasible in some cases.
