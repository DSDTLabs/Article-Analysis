SAN FRANCISCO:   and   CEO   attended an infamously lewd party — which he thought was a costume event — at the house of American businessman and venture capitalist   in June 2017, but did not participate in sexual activities.

 According to a spokesperson for the billionaire entrepreneur, Musk understood it to be a venture capital-hosted costume party but on learning that it was not, left early.
 
 In an email to Business Insider, Musk's spokesperson wrote: "Elon was at the party for a couple of hours and left around 1 am after talking about technology and building companies with several entrepreneurs funded by American venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ)." "His impression was that it was a corporate party with a costume theme, not a ‘sex party' and there was no indication that it would become one after he left," the email quoted him as saying.
 
 The incident came to fore after an extract from Bloomberg reporter Emily Chang's forthcoming book "Brotopia" detailed a party at a venture capitalist's house that saw drug-taking and open sexual behaviour. Following this, tech entrepreneur Paul Biggar wrote in a blog post that while "they didn't see any explicit sexual behaviour, they did see   Musk in attendance". "I don't want this to be anti-climactic, but I didn't see any sex or drugs. I went home at 12.30 am, and I guess sex parties don't really kick off until the boring f**kers go home," he wrote. "I didn't exactly know it was a sex party, and I got bored at some point and went home," he added.
