NEW DELHI: The Delhi   has come to the aid of a   of  , allowing her challenge to the clean chit given to its   in a case of alleged  .

 A bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and A K Chawla set aside the findings of Air France’s internal complaints committee (ICC) after it found that the process of constituting the panel was invalid.
 
 “Consequently, the constitution of ICC by Air France and all its resultant proceedings, including the report submitted by it, are...set aside. It is hereby directed that ICC should be reconstituted in strict compliance with the requirements under law within 30 days and the committee should conduct its inquiry afresh,” the bench ordered.
 
 HC agreed with the basic argument of the complainant that one of the key requirements under Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act is that ICC must also contain an unbiased outsider aware of women’s causes. 
 
 In this case, the airline roped in a lawyer as one of the ICC members. “There is nothing on record in the facts of this case to show the experience of Michael Dias in dealing with cases of sexual harassment, the cause of women in general and that he is from a non-governmental organisation. After repeated inquiries by the appellant, only vague clarifications were given by ICC,” HC observed.
 
 “The basic object of Parliament is to provide security to the woman. It is imperative that a woman, who is alleging sexual harassment, feels safe during the course of the proceedings of ICC and has faith that the proceedings are unbiased and fair.” 
 
 The woman had alleged that after being subjected to repeated sexual harassment by her boss, a French national, she made a complaint but was coerced into signing a resignation letter and thrown out of the company without an explanation. It was only after the police lodged an FIR that her complaint was entertained and an ICC set up.
