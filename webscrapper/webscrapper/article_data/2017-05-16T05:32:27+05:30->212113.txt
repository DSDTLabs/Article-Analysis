AHMEDABAD: The slugging functioning of courts in the   has left a teacher in the lurch, as he faces   just two days after his release from jail in connection with charges of molesting a minor student last month.

 Hemudan Jadav, a teacher with   municipal school, filed an application on Monday before the city sessions court to provide a certified copy of his bail order on an urgent basis. This came after the court staff refused to supply a certified copy on the grounds that during the summer vacation, certified copies of orders are supplied only on Thursdays.
 
 Interestingly, Jadav was released on conditional bail. One of the conditions is that he has to mark his presence before Danilimda police station every alternate day without fail or his bail would be cancelled.
 
 After his release on Saturday, Jadav went to Danilimda police station and explained his case and asked to register his presence according to the court order. The cops refused to register his presence without a certified copy of the court order granting him bail.
 
 Jadav did not have enough time to wait for the copy as two days have already passed since his release from Sabarmati jail. He rushed to the sessions court, but to his dismay, he was told that the copy would be available only on Thursday, his advocate Anand Brahmbhatt said.
