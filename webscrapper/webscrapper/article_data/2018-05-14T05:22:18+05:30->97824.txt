AHMEDABAD: Over the past week, the civic body has undertaken a massive task of desilting and cleaning of 12 bone-dry city lakes. Large earthmovers and dumpsters can be seen working overnight carrying dried silt out of the lake beds. A lot of activity can be seen in Chandlodiya lake, Gota lake — behind RC technical school, Mahalaxmi talav in   and   in   area. 

 However, experts have suggested that the desilting activity must be carried out after a thorough hydrological study of the lakes, so that the original lake beds are not disturbed. According to them unscientific desilting may increase percolation rate resulting in heavy seepage. 
 
 “De-silting, if not done scientifically can create isolated pits of considerable size in the lake's submergence area, which may lead to lower bottom levels than the main original storage,” said Pratik Suthar, a hydrologist and resident of Gota. “Because of this isolation, water collected in these pits never reach the main storage, it only seeps or evaporates,” he added. 
 
 On the other hand, the Congress on Sunday protested against the AMC’s decision of not including   lake, the biggest lake in the city, in its desilting operation.   officials have claimed that Chandola lake requires a special team of hydrologists and environmental experts, as there are issues of contamination that have to be tackled first to revive the lake.
