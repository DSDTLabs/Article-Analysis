GURUGRAM: Five friends, all BPO executives out for a late-night party, were injured when the car they were travelling in rammed into a Jersey barrier and overturned near Shankar Chowk in the early hours of Saturday. 

 Eyewitnesses said one of the front tyres burst while the vehicle was descending the flyover, leading to the accident. Police are yet to file any case in this regard.
 
 Manvinder Chikara, the owner of the white Ford Fiesta, and his friend Rishi are still undergoing treatment at Max hospital, Sushant Lok, where doctors described their condition as critical. 
 
 Anoop, Vaibhav Shah and another friend escaped with minor injuries. 
 
 The three were taken to Chiranjivi hospital and discharged in the afternoon.
 
 Manvinder works at FIS Global Business Solutions Pvt. Ltd, Rishi at IBM, and Vaibhav at  , while the others work with two other BPO firms.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Vaibhav, who received internal injuries on his shoulders and is still in a state of shock, said they were coming from Delhi around 3.10am when the accident happened.
 
 “Around midnight, we made a plan to meet Rishi, who is going to get married soon. We were returning to Gurgaon from FIS in Udyog Vihar Phase 4. While coming down from the Shankar Chowk flyover, one of the front tyres burst and Manvinder, who was behind the wheel, lost control of the car. The car rammed a barrier and overturned,” he said.
 
 Locals rushed to their rescue and took them to hospital. “Chikara and Rishi are still in hospital. But I could not go to meet them as my shoulder is paining,” Vaibhav said.
