While there are several benefits of social media, the platforms have also become a ground for trolls to pick on celebrities for the work they do or what they say. From   stars to television personalities, no one is spared by these trolls. The first season of   Tamil saw several participants being trolled for their behaviour in the house. 

 Oviya, was among the very few, who weren’t trolled that much. Ask the chirpy actress about how she handles trolling, and she says, “When someone is trolling me, I don’t take it very seriously. But not everyone can take it lightly. If you like a star, motivate them. You shouldn’t hurt the celebrities. They are humans, too.” 
 
  also adds that there is so much pressure being a celebrity. “Being a known personality is a lot of stress. You are constantly being watched. But I like to live a normal life. And that is why I don’t take my actress tag too seriously,” she says.
