Bengaluru: Four days after issuing an order transferring the Kannada lecturer of the Maharani’s Arts, Commerce and Management College for Women who allegedly molested an undergraduate student, the college management has decided to suspend him.

 After TOI first reported the incident on March 19, V S Ugrappa, chairperson of the Expert Committee to Prevent Crimes on Women and Children, visited the college on Monday.
 
  “We’ve shared the details with the committee. The commissioner of the department of collegiate education (Ajay Nagabhushan) was also present. We’ve decided to suspend the lecturer and the order is being readied,” Maharani’s principal R Shanthakumari said. 
 
 Students of the college have alleged that Ramalingappa, who had been teaching Kannada for the past five years at the 79-year-old institution, had attempted   even in the past. While his earlier attempts had not been pursued seriously, the latest incident was taken up with the management. The lecturer had asked the girl to drop off a bag in the staff room, to where he followed her and allegedly touched her inappropriately. He was transferred to another college in Jevargi in Kalaburagi district
 
 Ugrappa said the committee has seen multiple cases in various institutions, but there’s hardly any police complaint registered. The committee has powers to make recommendations to the government about how to prevent such crimes. “We will be looking at various loopholes in the procedures followed, and not only how redressal systems can improve but also on how to create an environment to ensure such things do not happen,” he had told TOI.
