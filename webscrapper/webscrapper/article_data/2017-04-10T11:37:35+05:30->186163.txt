NASHIK: With two months of summer still to go, the administration is now focusing on   in the dams across the district till July 31, 2017. 

 The   in the dams have dipped to 32% across the district, though the dams providing water to   (NMC) are better placed at 48%.
 
 "The situation in the district is better than last year. But the manner in which the mercury is soaring, it is likely to create problems. We are taking into consideration the rising temperatures and its effect on agriculture," a senior officer from the revenue department said. 
 
 Last year, the stock in the dams was only 12% and those reservoirs catering to the city had 23% water. 
 
 "The city has better availability of water this year. Last year, the water cut was carried out across the city. This year, no such decision has been taken. The situation may be reviewed by April-end," an official from NMC said.
 
 The district administration and the water supply department, both responsible for providing water to the rural areas, have appealed to farmers and citizens to use water judiciously.
 
 "Good rains and the   works carried out at a few villages have ensured the availability of surface water in rural areas for longer period than usual. Now, these sources are drying up or will be exhausted in the couple of days. Similarly, the groundwater levels have also begun dropping. The administration will plan supply of water as required," an officer from   said. 
 
 So far, only seven tankers have been pressed into service across the district - in Malegaon and Baglan talukas. 
 
 "Only seven tankers have been pressed into service for providing water to 25 villages and hamlets in Malegaon and Baglan talukas. This is against the 72 tankers deployed to provide water to more than 270 villages and hamlets last year during the same period ," sources from district administration said.
