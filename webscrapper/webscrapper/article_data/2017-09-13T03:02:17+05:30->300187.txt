GURUGRAM: BJP’s gau raksha footprint can be seen on the MCG   as well, with the son of Haryana Gau Seva Aayog’s chairman Bhani Ram Mangla’s son Pramod Mangla securing the party ticket from ward number 19, brushing aside several other contenders. 

 With just a day left for filing of nominations,   released the   of the remaining nine   on Tuesday evening, which left a bitter taste among the unsuccessful candidates. 
 
 “My son is into theatre and has performed in Gurgaon recently. He has been doing some social work in this ward for some time now. My stature as the chairman of the committee also helped him bag this ticket,” Bhani Ram told TOI.
 
 Those who did not manage to figure in the list accused the district leadership of selling tickets, with one even claiming that tickets were sold for a whopping Rs 80 lakh. 
 
 “My name was topping the list of contenders but as I refused to pay, my candidature was rejected and MLA Umesh Aggarwal’s sister-in-law was given the ticket. Aggarwal just wants to grab power and had even asked me to withdraw my candidature. I will now   as an independent candidate,” claimed Sunita Kataria, a former councillor.
 
 Like Sunita, Lakhpat Kataria too said that BJP has done a huge mistake by refusing ticket to him. “I would not have contested as an independent candidate had BJP given the ticket to someone who belonged my ward (14). However, Sachin Dahiya, who is not from the ward, will be contesting from here,” Lakhpat said.
 
 Meanwhile, the INLD has decided to contest in only 22 out of 35 wards. 
 
 On Tuesday, 53 candidates filed their nomination, bringing the total number to 88 so far. Despite repeated attempts Umesh Aggarwal could not be contacted.
