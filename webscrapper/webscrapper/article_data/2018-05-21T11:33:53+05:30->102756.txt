CHENNAI: A man who found dust particles in a two-litre   he bought for Rs 30 five years ago won a consumer dispute against the packaged drinking   manufacturer. District consumer redressal forum, Chennai (north), while chiding the company for unfair trade practices, directed it to pay a compensation of Rs 5,000 for the mental agony caused to the consumer. 

 R Lakshmanan, of Choolai, had purchased the water bottle manufactured by Paras Aqua Products from a dealer on March 7. On purchase, Lakshmanan found dust particles settled inside the bottle and informed the dealer and the manufacturer immediately. Since there was no response, he issued a legal notice a week later.
 
  “The wilful sale of water bottle containing dust and hazardous materials inside the bottle resulted in mental agony,” the complainant said in his petition, seeking compensation.
 
 Neither the manufacturer nor the dealer filed a counter petition in the case. The bench, comprising members K Jayabalan and M Uyiroli Kannan, ruled in favour of the petitioner after perusing the documents.
 
 The water bottle was sent to the King’s Institute in Guindy for analysis which found small bits of   and plastic floating in it and deemed the sample unsafe for consumption.
 
 The consumer forum observed that the company, Paras Aqua Products (Pvt) Ltd, manufactured and sold unsafe   water, which amounts to unfair trade practice and directed it to pay a sum of Rs 5,000 to the petitioner within six weeks from the date of receiving the order, failing which the amount shall carry 9% interest till the date of payment.
