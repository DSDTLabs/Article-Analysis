 Though the   — popular with the hashtags #thighmakeup and #thighface — started showing up late last year, it is catching up only now.   bloggers are making thighs their new frontier in contouring, and creating expert faces, complete with fake lashes.
 The result? Freaky as well as intriguing. Some creative ones are even doing the same thing 
 on their arm, though it is much smaller a space to draw a full face. You can even choose one 
 facial feature to draw and practice your makeup skills on.
 Makeup expert Zorain Khaleeli says, “For makeup lovers, just one face is not enough. Guess there is always a thirst to experiment more. Face charts used to be a great way in which artists used faces printed on paper to explore new looks, but there are always limitations to working on paper. The thigh is a great replacement area with actual skin and a larger canvas. Creating dimension on a flat surface is not easy unlike the already 3D face. It can truly test your matte verses shine skills of products. But overall, I think it’s just one more fad, which is more for practice than to wear in public.”
