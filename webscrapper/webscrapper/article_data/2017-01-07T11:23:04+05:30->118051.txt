GUWAHATI: The   on Friday asked the Assam Police CID to inform the court about the status of a proposed video teleconference (VTC) between the investigation agency and the department of justice, USA in connection with the multi-crore Louis Berger bribery scam. 

 The court response came during the hearing of a PIL filed by  , seeking the court's intervention in the investigation by an independent agency such as the CBI.
 
 The scam had surfaced in 2015, when  , a New Jersey-based construction management company, told a New Jersey court that it had bribed officials to win the contract for project management consultancy in a Guwahati water supply project. US court documents then revealed that the firm, along with several consortium partners, had paid bribes of Rs 6.1 crore for two water development projects in Goa and Guwahati.
 
 The state government had then ordered a CID inquiry into the alleged scam.
 
 The CID, in a reply before the court, said, "The USA department of justice is willing to share the information with CID, Assam and invited the investigators to Washington DC. In a letter received in October last year, the USA department of justice suggested arranging a VTC with the CID before a formal visit to share the records and discuss the evidence."
 
 The CID informed the court that it has already alerted higher central authorities about the suggestion.
 
 Petitioner Bhaben Handique told TOI, "After hearing the CID, the high court has asked the investigating agency to furnish its reply before the court detailing what steps are being taken to initiate the VTC. The court has given four weeks' times to CID to file its response." 
 
 Obtaining the documents from the USA department of justice is vital to the investigation. The CID has already quizzed several senior state government officials in connection with the case. It has also questioned officers of the Delhi-based office of Louis Berger.
