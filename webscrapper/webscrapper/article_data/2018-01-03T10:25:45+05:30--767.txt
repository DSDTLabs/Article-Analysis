DOHA:   had an opportunity to stem the tide. Make that three, the 26-year-old had three match points. Up against the 21-year-old   in the first round of the Qatar ExxonMobil Open, the second-seeded Spaniard, looking to win his second match since making the semifinals of the US Open last September, stuttered and stumbled. Busta, who had lost eight of his last nine Tour matches, came up short yet again.

 Coric, ranked 48, fired 44 winners, to put away Busta. The Croat, who faced a breakpoint in the opening game of the match, came through 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (10-8) and will play Georgiaâ€™s Nikoloz Basilashvili.
