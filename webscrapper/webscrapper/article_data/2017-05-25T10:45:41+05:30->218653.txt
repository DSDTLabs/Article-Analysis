PATNA: The   ( ) on Wednesday realised Rs 72,000 as fine from meat sellers running their shops without valid licence.

 The fine was collected on the first day of a special drive conducted near the   locality, which falls under the   (NCC) of PMC. Executive officer Vishal Anand said the civic body will continue such raids in the city.
 
 “These shops were running without valid licence in an unhygienic environment,” Anand said, adding even the animals were being slaughtered in open and in front of other animals in gross violation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Asked about fine imposed per shop, Anand said it varied between Rs 1,000 and Rs 5,000, depending on three parameters – whether shops are being run from encroached area, whether shops are throwing the leftovers on roads and whether shops have valid licence or not.
 
 He said apart from obtaining the licence from PMC, meat sellers have to ensure that they do not display the product in the open. “Every such shop should have a refrigerator to store meat,” Anand added. “Meat sellers should contact the circle office concerned to get the licence,” he said.
