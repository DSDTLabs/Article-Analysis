NEW DELHI: The home ministry on Friday said it had granted security go-ahead to over 4,600 foreign investment proposals in the past four years of   government, apart from cutting the average processing time for such clearances to 50 days from four months. 

 
 According to data shared by the ministry, while 815   were granted security clearance by the home ministry in 2014, 1,201 clearances in 2015, 1,260 in 2016 and 1,071 in 2017. Till April 30 this year, 270 foreign investment proposals had received the green signal from the home ministry against 217 applications received (the balance clearances being due to the backlog from 2017). 
 
 “FDI security clearance is now an online process. Because of the robust   clearance policy introduced in 2015, not only are more proposals getting the nod but also the turnaround time for such clearances has been reduced by more than 50%,” said a home ministry officer. 
 
 On Monday, TOI had reported the home ministry had been asked by the government to avoid unnecessary delays in processing FDI clearances, often based on unsubstantiated concerns expressed by “low-ranking officials.”
