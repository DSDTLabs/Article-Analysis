KOCHI: Activist and counsellors said that   should act in a responsible manner as kids get access to high-end gadgets and mobiles from them. There are innumerable instances where children have embarrassed and shocked parents while using these gadgets, especially mobile phones, they said.

 “We see parents who want a solution as their children throw tantrums when they are denied phones. In some cases, parents themselves buy high-end mobiles and then don't know how to handle the situation,“ said Childline coordinator  . “It is parents who are to blame for buying these gadgets. It starts with kids using a parent's phone and then by Class VI, the kids have their own WhatsApp group.After Class X, they have high-end phones. What's happening is sharing of images though kids say that they are discussing and sharing essons,“ said psychologist  .
 
 “Kids get addicted and they cannot take no for an answer.When it goes out of hand, they seek help from school counsellors and teachers,“ she said, adding that parents have forgotten their roles as persons of authority at home by being too friendly to their children.
