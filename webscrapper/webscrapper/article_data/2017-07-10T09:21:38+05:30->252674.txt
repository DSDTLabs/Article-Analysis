PUNE: Around 73.33 lakh people have e-filed returns, with over 22 lakh of them either the digital signatures or the Aadhaar one time passwords, in the first three months of the current fiscal. 

 Statistics indicate at an increasing trend of people taking the e-route to file their   returns and claim refunds. Since the government has made it mandatory to link Aadhaar with the permanent account number (PAN), about 3.19 crore people have linked the the two till date, revealed data on the income tax department’s e-filing portal.
 
 Over 56% of the e-filers in the three-month period ending June 2017 were salaried individuals and pensioners — higher than about 48% of the total returns e-filed by individuals and pensioners in the 2016-17 fiscal. Though the final percentage of the individual e-filers might change, early data indicates that business houses e-file returns towards the end or also after the July 31 deadline.
 
 On a like-to-like basis (comparing the April-June 2017 over April-June 2016 date), the ITR-1 filers (salaried individuals/ pensioners) increased by 19%. 
 
 The trend of e-filing has caught on despite it being not mandatory for those earning below Rs 5 lakh per annum to e-file returns. “The volume of those filing paper returns is miniscule (last year it was under 6% of overall returns filed) and it is coming down every year. It might reduce further this year,” said  , managing director at H&R Block India.
 
 In fact, about 59.95 lakh e-filers were under the Rs 5 lakh bracket. There is no data available yet on how many of the e-filers actually paid tax. 
 
 While the top court is yet to decide on a batch of public interest litigations relating to the many privacy and data security issues connected to Aadhaar, it has given the government the go-ahead to link Aadhaar and PAN.
 
 “The e-verification process started two years ago and quite a few people are using it,” said Sankla.
