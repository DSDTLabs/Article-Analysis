NEW DELHI:   made its debut on social media with its   page and official   handle on May 5. 

 People can file their complaints directly on these platforms, which are regularly monitored, a   official said. "DDA is on Twitter as 'official_dda' and on Facebook as 'ddaofficial'. The latest updates and information will be available on http://www.dda.org.in," DDA first tweeted recently. 
 
 Residents have already flooded the Twitter handle with complaints of lack of amenities in their areas. The majority of tweets are from the residents of Dwarka.
 
 A DDA official said these platforms were created following the directions of the Union minister for housing and urban affairs  . "The plan to open these accounts has been in the pipeline for quite some time," the spokesperson of DDA said, adding that now, people can easily give their feedback, suggestions or complaints directly to DDA. 
 
 The land-owning agency has outsourced the day to day management of these accounts to an agency. "They have been provided numbers of all heads of departments of DDA and they coordinate with them. In case there is a need to respond to a tweet or a query, the official reply is provided by the respective department and then the agency puts it on the social media," the spokesperson said.
