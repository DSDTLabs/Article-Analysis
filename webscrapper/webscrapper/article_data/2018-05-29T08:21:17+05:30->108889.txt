LUCKNOW: The   (EC) on Monday grappled with a large-scale glitches in electronic voting machines (EVMs) in more than 380 booths in both   and Noopur bye-elections on Monday even as officials cited 'heat' as the reason for the malfunction. 

 "It is correct that 15% machines malfunctioned. It could be due to high temperature that some VVPATs developed snags. We are rectifying the problem. We also have 25% machines in reserve. Where the EVMs are beyond repair, we are replacing them. Charges of tampering are completely baseless," UP chief electoral officer   said.
 
 This was reiterated by   district magistrate who also cited rise in temperature as a genuine reason for glitch in the EVM.
 
 
 
 
 VVPAT machines' sensor developed snag due to heat. As soon as we received complaints, we repaired them. It can happen at times and we are fixing it,”said Indra Vikram Singh, DM Shamli. Opposition, including SP and Congress, ridiculed EC for the reason. SP chief   said his party has had enough since 2017 UP polls and will officially seek a demand for ballot paper voting. “It's laughable that EC has given heat as the reason. There can't be more absurdity in world's powerful democracy where everything depends on people's voices. We will raise a ballot paper voting system demand” he told TOI.
