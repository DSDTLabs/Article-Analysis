JAIPUR:   are yet to represent   and minorities in a proper manner, noted  . At the   (JLF) session, ‘Mother India: Indian films and the national narrative,’ panelist and director Imtiaz Ali and Mishra also said that change was taking place, but at a slow pace.

 Highlighting the fact that’s evident in mainstream movies, Mishra said Bollywood films rarely featured a Dalit actor or told stories of marginalised communities.
 
 “It does represent a majoritarian point of view, possibly because there is this idea of not upsetting people. At one point in time, Muslims were depicted a certain way. He would either be a ‘qawwal’ or the hero's best friend and he would die with the ‘azaan’ in the background,” said Mishra.
 
 “Has there been a Dalit actor of any note? Has dalit stories been told? When you take only Bollywood cinema, you know you have a pretty sad record in these matters and we have to admit it,” he said. Both Ali and Mishra, however, agreed that things were changing for the better.
 
 During the session, Ali recalled how movies, rather than moral science textbooks, had shaped his morality and outlook on what moral standards to follow.
 
 “The Indian cinema has always told me how to behave with my mother and sister. What moral standards to have. Cinema taught me how to behave rather than religion or moral science books. There are social issues and national issues, which I feel, are getting moulded by Indian cinema,” Ali said.
