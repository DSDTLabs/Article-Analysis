CHENNAI: An average of about 20% of   cases registered in   over ten years resulted in conviction of the accused, and the conviction rate is below the all India rate of 25%.

 A submission to this effect was made in the court by the government on Tuesday, in response to 25 pertinent queries raised by Justice N   a few weeks ago. The judge had asked the authorities to submit the data for the past 10 years.
 
 As per the data submitted by Maheswaran, assistant inspector-general of police, furnished the conviction rate in rape cases revealing the fact that the year 2016 had been the worst year, as only about 19% of rape cases ended in conviction in Tamil Nadu though the all India average stood at 25.5%
 
 After perusing the records, Justice Kirubakaran lamented the state had scored below the national average of conviction rate in all the years since 1007. 
 
 The state has lagged behind in the rate of conviction of such heinous crimes, he remarked.
 
 This apart, the state informed the court that primary reasons for increase of such crimes were lack of sex education, parental care, improper upbringing, association with bad people, leaving children alone under the care of relatives and others, and lack of moral education.
 
 Though the union government was also directed to respond to the queries, no one represented the Centre on Tuesday. Noting that such crimes were happening across the country and in all the states making women and children suffer, the judge said a response from the Centre was a must.
 
 Pointing out that some of such offences are committed by persons with psychological problems, Justice Kirubakaran said the state must also try to form committees to suggest solutions. Unless some urgent measures are taken, no one can help the victims, he added.
 
 He then posted the case to April 23 for the Centre to file its response.
