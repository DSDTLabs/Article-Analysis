LUCKNOW: Launching a scathing attack on BJP, Samajwadi Party national president   on Monday demanded a high-level probe into the gang rape allegation against a sitting ruling party MLA and demanded that chief minister step down taking moral responsibility for failure to protect women. 

 Yadav said that incidents of rape and crime against women have increased manifold under the present regime as the government has turned a deaf ear. "Nobody is ready to listen to the complaint of a rape survivor who has been running around for justice. She came to seek CM's help. She had alleged that her father and uncle were being booked in fake criminal cases and that her father was being subjected to severe torture in jail but no one listened to her," said   expressing surprise over the manner in which rape survivors were being treated.
 
 "The rape survivor has accused   and his brother of rape and that her family was being pressured to withdraw allegations against them but all her pleas fell on deaf years. Eventually, her father died. Such incidents reflect the seriousness of the government's claim of ensuring protection of women and people of the state.
 
  chief Raj Babbar, who sat on a day-long fast in Lucknow on Monday to protest against the 'environment of fear and oppression' being created in the country, said, "A girl who has alleged rape by a BJP MLA goes to the CM to complain. She tries to immolate herself. What does the CM do? Her father gets picked up by police and dies in custody. Meanwhile, instead of taking action against the accused, government suspends some police personnel and tries to absolve itself. Will this girl ever get justice?"
