PUNE: When   shot 31 to win the   gold beating the likes of Olympian   Singh in the final of   last month, many thought it was a one-off performance.

 Anish, 15, conveyed that his national gold wasn't a fluke as he shot a World Record breaking score in the senior national trials at the Dr   range on Tuesday. Anish shot 37 to win the second trial in as many days to virtually confirm his place in the senior squad.
 
 The World Record in 25m rapid fire event was registered by Italian shooter  . He had totaled 35 at the World Cup in Beijing in 2014. Anish's 37 is two more than the existing WR, but since he shot the score in a national event, it won't be recognized as a WR. According to the   ( ), a score registered only in world events or continental championships, would be recognized as a record.
 
 Nonetheless, Anish broke Gurpreet's national record of 35, which the Rio Games participant had shot at the nationals in 2016.
 
 "I have been shooting 36-37 in the training sessions, but I was been able to convert it in the match. I am glad I could do it today," Anish told TOI.
