British-Pakistani terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh is infamous as the man who almost brought India and Pakistan to the brink of a war. He brutally beheaded American journalist  , too. And now,   is all set to make a film — touted to be a terrifying true story — on the terrorist.

 Titled 'Omertà', the film will mark the reunion of Hansal Mehta and   after ' ' with the National Award-winning actor playing the dreaded terrorist. 
 The filmmaker says that the edge-of-the-seat drama, whose trailer launches today, throws light on the diabolical designs of Pakistan-sponsored terror. He explains, “This film is an exposé of state-sponsored terror, in this case, perpetrated by Pakistan. They have been harbouring terror for far too long and far too liberally.” Talking about his character,   says, “Omar Sheikh is an example of how educated youth get drawn towards extremist ideologies and the wrong interpretation of jihad. Their destructive actions cause long-lasting ripples in society.”
 
 'Omertà' has been shot in real locations across London and India, and the story revolves around some of the deadliest terror attacks in recent history, including the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks, the 26/11 Mumbai terror strike and the brutal beheading of Pearl. The film premiered to excellent reviews at the Toronto International Film Festival 2017, followed by a good reception at the Busan International Film Festival. It also witnessed a successful screening as the closing film at the Mumbai Film Festival 2017.
 
 'Omertà', presented by Swiss Entertainment and Karma Media and produced by Nahid Khan, releases on April 20.
