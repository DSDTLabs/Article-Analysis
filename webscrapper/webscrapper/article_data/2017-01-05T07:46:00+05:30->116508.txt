JALANDAR: A coalition of three Left parties on Wednesday announced candidates from 52 assembly seats for the upcoming state elections. 

 The leaders of ‘Left Alliance’, which is a coalition of CPI, CPI (M) and the   (RMPI), also announced that they would contest from all assembly seats in Punjab and the Amritsar   byelection, too. 
 
 Though CPI (ML-Liberation) was also part of the alliance initially, it later withdrew due to differences. Addressing a press conference here, CPI state secretary Hardev Arshi, CPI (M) state secretary   and Revolutionary Marxist Party of India (RMPI) state secretary   released their alliance’s first list of candidates in Jalandhar. According to the present arrangement, CPI will contest from 25 seats, CPI (M) from 14 seats, and RMPI from 13.
 
 The three leaders said took potshots at all three major parties. They said the SAD and BJP were in a communal alliance, while the Congress and AAP were trying to “lure people after amassing a lot of financial resources through corrupt means”. 
 
 They also gave a call to the other Left organizations in the state to join hands with their alliance. Asked about CPI (ML Liberation) staying out, Pasla said negotiations were on, as there were some hiccups about three seats in Mansa district. “We expect them to come on board too,” he said.
