AHMEDABAD: City crime branch on Saturday   Elamkhan Jatmalek of Patdi and Rafiq Sumra of Juhapura, for the murder of transporter Suresh Shah on March 10. Shah was shot dead by two bike-borne assailants near Vishweshwar Temple in Vasna. 

 A car belonging to Rajendra Shekwa, which was allegedly used to recce the scene of the crime, has also been seized. Police are hunting for the absconding accused and very soon could nab them. 
 
 DCP (crime branch) Deepan Bhadran said the principal accused is Rajendra Shekwa, a logistics contractor for Food Corporation of India (FCI). The other involved are the two unknown shooters and five others, some of whom are Shekwa’s family members. They are all at large. Bhadran said they have nabbed Jatmalek and Sumra, who allegedly carried out the recce and hired the shooters.
 
 “Shekwa had an old enmity with Suresh Shah. Because of their business rivalry, Shekwa was shot in 2009, near the FCI office in Paldi. He suffered serious injuries to his back. Suresh Shah and the alleged shooter Shabbir Madam were arrested for the shooting. Shah was acquitted in the case in November 2017 and Shekwa was looking for revenge since then,” added Bhadran.
 
 Shekwa had allegedly kidnapped Shah in 2006 and taken him to Rajkot. He then beat him up at his farmhouse. However, no complaint was lodged by Shah at the time. 
 
 Shekwa contacted Jatmalek and offered Rs 50 lakh for killing Shah. Crime branch officials said Jatmalek, who has a criminal history, then contacted Sumra.
 
 “The four met at Jatmalek’s house in Patdi. There, Sumra was given Rs 30,000 as travelling expense to hire contract killers. Rs 15 lakh was paid in advance to Jatmalek and Sumra for the killing,” said ADCP Rajdeepsinh Jhala.
