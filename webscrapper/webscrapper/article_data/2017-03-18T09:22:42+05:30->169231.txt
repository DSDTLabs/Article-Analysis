CHENNAI: Spending on   (subsidies) in Tamil Nadu has increased by 144% in five years since the   government took charge in 2011.

 During the period, the state's own   increased only by 66.17% and due to this the deficit in the revenue account and the fiscal deficit have increased each year.
 
 In 2011-12, the government spent `29,726.34 crore on subsidies and transfers and in the coming year , the government allocated `72,615.76 crore for welfare schemes and local bodies. Each year more than 50% of the state's own tax revenue has been spent only on welfare schemes. For other expenses the government has been borrowing, due to which the debt is going up by the year.
 
 A statement issued by the state finance department soon after the budget was presented in the assembly shows that around `14,000 crore of the `72,615.76 will go to local bodies as transfers and the rest will be spent on various freebies. The revised estimates for 2016-17 show the tax revenue will be `87,286.91 crore and out of this subsidies alone will be around `55,812.78 crore. “TN has come to a stage where the ruling party will have to take a hard look at the financial situation before announcing schemes. It can't blindly keep spending on freebies. It is at best given to the poorest of the poor,“ economist   told TOI. There may be several politi cal compulsions for the present government more than at any other time, but with than at any other time, but with the fiscal deficit going through the roof and a deficit in the revenue account, the government must stop spending on freebies.
 
 “If former chief minister   was alive today , she would have taken some steps to increase the state's revenue at least by getting the balance on various schemes from the Centre. But even after sending several reminders, the Centre is yet to release even a single rupee to wards drought,“ said the expert.
 
 A look at the budgets from 2011-12 to 2017-18 shows the expenditure on subsidies and transfers increased the maximum between 2012-13 and 2013-14 and once again between 2014-15 and 2015-16.In both the years the expenditure on subsidies increased by 21%.
 
 It was only in 2014, the government introduced several schemes under brand Amma.This includes subsidised mineral water, cement, salt etc. “Subsidies are justified as long as they reach the needy . But in the power sector, the boards cross-subsidise and this increases the tariff of one section while it is lower for the other,“ said an economist.“By lowering the tariff for some consumers and passing on the subsidy to others by increasing their tariff would lead to inflation,“ he said.
