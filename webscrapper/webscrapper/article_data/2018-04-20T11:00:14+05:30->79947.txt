PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Two persons were injured in a   in the   of   on Thursday morning.

 The gram panchayat has submitted a letter to the forest department officials requesting the installation of cages in and around the village to catch the leopards. 
  
  
 Giving details of the attack, MD Dighe, the range forest officer (RFO) of Nasrapur, said, “Suresh Jagtap, 54, and Kiran Pangare, 36, sustained minor injuries on their hands and chest in the attack. They were sleeping outside their home at night to beat the summer heat. Both the men were first taken to a nearby public health centre and later to the rural hospital in Bhor.”
 
 Dighe said the rural hospital instructed them to take the injured persons to Sassoon hospital in Pune. “We had called for an ambulance on the helpline number 108 but did not get any response. So I took one of the injured persons to Pune in my official vehicle and the other injured man was taken in another vehicle,” he said.
 
 Talking about the likely reason for the leopard attack, Dighe said, “Devale village is located at the base of the Sahyadri hills. The forest land is located on the hills from where a stream flows into the village. It is very hot and prey is not available in the forest. The wild animals come from the hills towards the stream because of the cooler conditions. The leopard must have come into the village at night. One cow, two buffaloes and one calf were tied in the cattle shed outside the houses where the two men were sleeping.”
 
 Santosh Bathe, the village sarpanch, said Jagtap is a mason while Pangare is a driver.
 
 Bathe said, “One cow, two buffaloes and one calf sustained scratch injuries in the leopard attack at around 1.30am. The injured people screamed for help and other people sleeping outside woke up and came to their rescue. The leopard fled.”
