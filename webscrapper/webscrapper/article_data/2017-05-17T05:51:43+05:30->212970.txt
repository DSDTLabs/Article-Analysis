CHENNAI: Calling it a ‘misconceived’  ,   has declined to come to the rescue of a person who had put up a structure right behind the   and approached the court to stop officials from dismantling it.

 “The petitioner cannot possibly have any right to put up structures on pavements/ footpaths and that too without any permission whatsoever. The writ petition is entirely misconceived and the same is dismissed,” said the first bench Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar. It also refused to acknowledge the encroacher’s right to put up any structure on public platform at Annasilai, behind Avadi bus depot, and his plea to restrain the Chennai suburban police the auto stand at ‘without any prior intimation’.
 
 Dismissing the petition filed by D Gandhiraj , the bench said even an informal permission granted to him to park five vehicles in turns did not have any validity. “A perusal of the memorandum reveals that the petitioner was only granted permission to park five autos on the conditions that the autos can be parked on rotation basis. In case of any hindrance caused to the general public and traffic on account of parking of autos the stand would be removed without any prior intimation.”
 
 The bench further said, “There was no permission at all to construct any structure on the pavement/footpath. The commissioner of police, Chennai suburban police, reserved the right to remove the stand in case of any hindrance to public or traffic.”
