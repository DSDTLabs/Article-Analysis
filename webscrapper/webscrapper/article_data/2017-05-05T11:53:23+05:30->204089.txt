CALANGUTE: Travelling on the Baga-Calangute road at   has become a nightmare, with the PWD digging up a portion of the road to rectify a fault in the sewerage system. Local residents have been the most affected, besides business establishments and tourists. Residents who TOI spoke to, said they hoped the work would be completed before the onset of monsoon.

 Narrating his ordeal, senior citizen from Baga, John Egipsy, said he was facing a lot of problems commuting from Baga to Calangute as he had to take a longer route via Sankwadi, Arpora, to reach Calangute. “I don’t see PWD officials supervising the work,” he said.
 
 Another local resident,  , said many businesses in the area were affected as tourist vehicles do not ply further towards Baga due to the dilapidated road. “If work is not completed before the monsoon, it will create a massive problem,” he said. 
 
 “Work on the final sewerage chamber in under way. This is the last phase and by the end of the month the work will be complete and one coat of hotmix will be laid before the monsoon,” Calangute MLA Michael Lobo said.
 
 Residents fear that if there is an emergency in the locality, it could be fatal. It was noticed that even streetlights were missing to alert motorists travelling by night of the work in progress. No signboard indicating nature of work was to be found.
 
 “The only part remaining is Tito’s lane. We will start work on May 15, about five chambers have to be laid. We are trying to complete the work before the monsoons,” Lobo added.
