PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A delay in land acquisition may have a domino effect on the under-construction Bhakti-Shakti Chowk-Kiwale Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) road. 

 The key road is being developed by   to improve the city’s north-south connectivity. But work has been held up due to problems in acquiring land in one section of the corridor. According to officials, the entire project will be completed eight months after the land in question is acquired. 
 
 The 5km-long corridor connects Bhakti Shakti chowk on the Pune-Mumbai highway in Nigdi to Mukai chowk on   BRTS road. Once complete, this road will link the other two BRTS routes — Pune-Mumbai highway and Sangvi-Kiwale road.
 
 At the moment, if one has to go from Nigdi to   or Kiwale, then one must cross the railway tracks through the underpass neat Akurdi railway station and then proceed to one’s destination over the Sangvi-Kiwale BRTS road, making it a circuitous route.   came up with this new route as a solution. 
 
 the new road goes from Bhakti Shakti chowk till Nisarga Darshan Housing Society in Nigdi, where a railway over bridge (ROB) is being constructed to enable vehicles to cross the Pune-Mumbai railway tracks and easily to Ravet and beyond.
 
 “The 1.5km road from Bhakti Shakti chowk to the ROB is complete,” said  , spokesperson, BRTS cell spokesperson. “We have installed barricades on a 800m stretch till the ROB approach road to create dedicated BRT lanes. The approach road too is complete. We cannot start work on the approach road on the Ravet side due to problems in land acquisition for the 200m ramp. So 48% of the ROB work has been completed,” he added
 
 “Forty-six per cent of the work on the 2.5km long road from ROB to Kiwale is complete. There are land acquisition problems on a 1km stretch,” he added.
 
 “We will need eight months to complete constructing the road once we take the possession of the needed land,” he further said. stuck up in land acquisition.”
