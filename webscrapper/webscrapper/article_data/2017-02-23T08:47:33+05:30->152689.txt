MUMBAI: A police constable risked his life and pulled out a 35-year-old drunk man (in pic) from the death trap of a cement mixer vehicle into which the latter fell in with only his hands and head partly visible, on Wednesday.

 The incident occurred at around 2pm when the mixer vehicle stopped at   junction as the signal turned red. The drunk man, identified as  , climbed into the vehicle from the rear without the driver's knowledge. Fortunately, the mixer was not rotating when it stopped else the man would have died instantly, said police.
 
 A few locals from nearby shops who saw him climb into the vehicle and fall into it, stopped a patrolling van (mobile-1) near the junction and alerted the cops in it. “Had the locals not noticed Lalbahadur climbing in, he could have died within five minutes. When my constable   pulled him out, Lalbahadur was almost mixed with the concrete cement. Kamble risked his life and sneaked in through the mixer's mouth and managed to pull out the man,“ Sakinaka senior inspector   told TOI.
 
 The timely rescue effort was over in 15 minutes. “On learning a man had fallen into the mixer, we first asked the driver to park the vehicle on one side of the road. There was little time to call the fire brigade. I climbed the machine and managed to sneak through the mouth of the mixer. I managed to see the man inside the pitch dark container which was slightly moving and filled with wet cement concrete. The man's entire body was inside and only his head and hands was seen. Somehow I managed to pull him back. If the vehicle had started then he could have died in the cement and no one could have noticed,“ said Kamble.
 
 Kamble was awarded for his efforts.
