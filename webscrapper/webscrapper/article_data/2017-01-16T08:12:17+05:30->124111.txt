RUDRAPUR: The   (EO) on Sunday issued a show-cause notice to a Delhi-based advertising agency for allegedly violating the poll codes by fixing an advertisement of the   (BJP) on a billboard on   in poll-bound Uttarakhand.
 
  Sub-divisional magistrate-cum-EO   told TOI, “The advertising agency was using a billboard for advertisement without having prior certification, which is prima-facie a violation of the model code of conduct. And thus, they have been issued a show-cause notice.”
  
  Even as the advertisement was removed after Congress workers informed Upadhyay about the advertisement in the morning, a notice was issued to the advertising agency under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.
  
  “After the matter came to me, I summoned the owner of US advertisers,  , to my office. The advertiser submitted that they had a letter issued by the state election officer on January 12, permitting them to advertise for the party in the state during the elections. But the advertiser misused the permission under the model code of conduct as he is bound to inform either the district election officer (DEO) or me about placement of advertisements in advance,” said Upadhyay.
  
  Upadhyay warned political parties and candidates to adhere to the poll code during the assembly election and directed officers to act against any violation of the code.
  
  “Organisers of any political meetings, rallies and campaigns must take prior permission and adhere to the poll code, else officials will act strictly,” he added.
