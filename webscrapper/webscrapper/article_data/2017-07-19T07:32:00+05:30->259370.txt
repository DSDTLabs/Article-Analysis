Rolling boulders, deep potholes, no protection walls, landslides and rivers in spate make driving extremely risky along the   national highway. Although this is the most dangerous stretch of the   highway, elsewhere it has deep potholes. Besides, the road straddles the   in most places, making driving dangerous these days as there are no protection walls and parapets are missing at many places. The highway has many landslide prone zones, which have not been protected for over the years. At many places, boulders keep bombarding the highway in the rainy season. 

 Work for four-laning of the highway has deteriorated its condition, giving it deep pits at many places. Road excavation has led to water flowing on the highway and giving it a slippery mud spread. 
 
  executive engineer Raujif Sheikh put the onus for road maintenance on the contractors engaged for the four-laning project. “Except for a small stretch near Hanogi, all required repairs in the highway will be done by the contractors who have been awarded the work. As widening of the highway in   area is not possible, there is a proposal to build tunnels here,” he said.
