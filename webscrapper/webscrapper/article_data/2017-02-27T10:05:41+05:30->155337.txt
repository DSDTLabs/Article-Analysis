 Opposition parties are going to town appropriating Prime Minister Narendra Modi's love for acronyms. Recently, while campaigning in   for the ongoing Assembly elections there, Modi coined the acronym SCAM.
 
  "The BJP's fight is against scam. Do you know what 'SCAM' stands for? It is 'S' for Samajwadi Party (SP), 'C' for Congress, 'A' for Akhilesh and 'M' for Mayawati," he said about the opposition his BJP faces in the  .
 
 The Congress and the SP repaid him in the same coin.
 
 "The Prime Minister is very keen to use English abbreviations and he used ‘SCAM’ to attack his political rivals. We will tell you what ‘SCAM’ means in Hindi - it is ‘satta bhogi, kapti dhongi, Amit Shah Modi’," said Congress spokesman Tom Vadakkan.
 
 The SP chief minister also came up with his version of SCAM: "Save our Country from Amit Shah and Modi'.
