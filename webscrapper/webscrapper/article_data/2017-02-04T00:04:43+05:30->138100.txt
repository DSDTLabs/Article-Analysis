NEW DELHI: A 15-year-old boy allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself after he was scolded by his mother. The incident was reported from southwest Delhi’s Dwarka on Thursday night when the family members found him hanging from the ceiling fan.

 Police said that the boy, identified as Shiv, wanted to go out with his friends, but his parents refused. They asked him to stay at home and study.
 
 His family members said that the boy went inside his room and locked it. They thought he was angry and let him be. An hour after they went to sleep, his father woke up and went to Shiv’s room. Finding it locked, he started knocking the door repeatedly.
 
 When his son didn’t respond, he suspected something was wrong and went to wake his wife up. With her help, he broke the door open, only to see his son’s body hanging from the ceiling fan.
 
 Police said that they received a PCR call at 11pm, soon after which they went to the spot and rushed the boy to the hospital, where the doctors declared him brought dead.
 
 Family members told police that by the time they pulled the boy down, they suspected he had died as he was not responding.
 
 Police said that no suicide note has been found.
