Chief minister   on Tuesday reiterated that special CBI judge   died of a heart attack and that the doubts raised over his death were 'politically motivated'. 

 Fadnavis while replying on the law and order situation in the state legislative assembly said, "Even Loya's family members and son had told the media that there was nothing suspicious. His son also wrote to the chief justice about the same. Loya's son has said that a few people are politicising the death."
 
 Special CBI judge B H Loya, who was hearing the Sohrabuddin Sheikh encounter case, had died allegedly of cardiac arrest in Nagpur on December 1, 2014 when he had gone to attend the wedding of a colleague's daughter.
 
 A forensic expert from  , Delhi, Dr R K Sharma who was quoted by a magazine, also clarified that he was misquoted, said the CM. "In an email sent by Sharma, he has said that he had been grossly misquoted by the magazine regarding judge Loya's death and that he had a general discussion on the report and the conclusion drawn was imaginary. Sharma said that he had not given any report regarding the judge's death," said Fadnavis.
