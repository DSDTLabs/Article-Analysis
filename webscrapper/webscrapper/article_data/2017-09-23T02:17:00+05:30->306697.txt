MUMBAI: The   ( ) has arrested a bullion   in a money laundering case where he is accused of accepting Rs 84 crore during the demonetization period and using it to purchase 258 kg of gold.

 The ED will produce the accused, Chandrakant Patel of Pushpak Bullions, before a special court on Saturday to seek his custody.
 
 Officials said that during the demonetization period many people purchased gold with their unaccounted money to avoid government scrutiny, while some also approached jewellers who charged a premium to exchange the banned notes with legitimate ones. The investigating officials said that jewellers would ask such people to deposit their cash with shell companies.
 
 The government announced demonetization last November and gave two months to citizens to deposit their demonetized currency — Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes — into their bank account.
 
 The ED took up the Pushpak Bullions case after it came to know that the company had received vast sums of money during demonetization through bank transfer. While examining the link, the officials learnt that Rs 84.5 crore in cash was deposited in the accounts of two dummy companies, Pihu Gold and Satnam Jewels, within 41 days during the demonetization period. The money was then transferred into the account of Pushpak Bullions, which purchased 258 kg of gold   with it.
 
 Investigators learnt that Patel negotiated with a PSU bank to simplify the cash deposit process of demonetized currency by Pihu Gold and Satnam Jewels. The money was deposited in the accounts on Patel’s instructions, said an official. The ED is also probing bank officials in the case.
 
 Recently, officials recorded the statements of Patel and others concerned and again called him for questioning. When Patel failed to appear before the ED, he was arrested.
 
 Pushpak Bullions was declared an NPA in March 2016.
