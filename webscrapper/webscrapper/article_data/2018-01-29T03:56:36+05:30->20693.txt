KOLKATA: A woman, on Sunday was arrested for regularly torturing her 55-year-old sister at Nimta in North Dum Dum after neighbours lodged a police complaint on Saturday. 

 The neighbours filmed the torture on their cellphones that show the suspect —   (46) — kicking her mentally disabled sister. She even stepped on her and pressed hard on her neck, while beating her mercilessly with a stick. 
 
 Shibu Ghosh, officer-in-charge of Nimta PS, said, “We have arrested the woman and will produce her in a Barrackpore court on Monday. A probe is on.”
 
 Rita lived in her elder sister Sikha’s house in Nimta. The locals said their mother Sadhana had bequeathed the entire property to Sikha as she is unmarried and mentally disabled. 
 
 Ratna Debnath, a local, said, “After Sadhana’s death, Rita, her husband Mantu and the couple’s daughter-in-law — Mallika — started living with Sikha. 
 
 Soon, they started eying the property and tried to force Sikha to hand over the property to them. Failing in their attempt to usurp the property,   started torturing her.”
 
 The members of a nearby club intervened and warned her not to torture Sikha. But Rita and Mallika threatened to incriminate them falsely if they protested.
 
 State food minister   visited the victim on Sunday evening and assured her of proper care at one of the Gitanjali housing projects for the elderly.
