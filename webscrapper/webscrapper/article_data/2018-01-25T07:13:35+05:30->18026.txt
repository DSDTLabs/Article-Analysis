AHMEDABAD:   on Wednesday expressed strong displeasure at the manner in which authorities in the state issue   to couples without verifying facts about their earlier marriages, and condemned involvement of lawyers in the ‘racket’.

 The judges called for an inquiry into such irregularities after a case landed before them, in which the man and woman both were married earlier and there were no proofs that they were divorced. Yet, the concerned authority issued marriage certificate to them.
 
 The court said, “A racket appears to be operating in the state of Gujarat, wherein middlemen are operating, upon payment of hefty amounts, to procure marriage registration certificates from the competent authority. What is more unfortunate is the indication that persons in the legal profession may also be involved.”
 
 The issue came before the HC when the man sought his wife’s custody from her parents and cited the marriage certificate issued December 30, 2017 by talati-cum-mantri of Deodar gram panchayat in Banaskantha. The court found that the man was already married, but the authorities did not bother to verify it. The woman also told the court that the certificate was issued without a marriage and there was no evidence of marriage provided before the registrar.
 
 This led the court to say, “It is not for the first time that we have noticed that the authority authorised to issue a Marriage Registration Certificate under the   Registration of Marriages Act, 2006, has done so without verifying whether the parties are already married, or not and whether the marriage has actually taken place.”
 
 The HC asked the public prosecutor’s office to bring the court order to the notice of state government so that appropriate action can be taken and “such practices by government servants may be curbed”.
