HYDERABAD: After nearly 10 pedestrian were identified as victims of fatal accidents in  , traffic police have considered pedestrians to be more vulnerable to road accidents due to lack of infrastructure. "Almost every year, nearly 30% of the accident victims have been identified as pedestrians. This is due to lack of infrastructure for pedestrians. The Foot over bridge (FOBs) are not senior citizen and children friendly. Hardly anyone use FoBs to cross roads, while   are encroached by hawkers," said  , founder of   

 "Most of the accident happens when the pedestrian try to cross the road, without waiting for signal to turn red. They are very vulnerable to accidents on the main roads and major junctions. While, most of the time, the accused do not even stop after hitting pedestrians," said ACP (Traffic), S Jayaram.
 
 Another reason, pedestrians frequently become victims of accidents, because of carelessly crossing roads. "Jaywalking is one of most common issue on city roads, including the IT corridor. We have personally witnessed, people crossing the road putting on their headphone and texting. This is dangerous for the public. The pedestrians should also be held accountable for accidents," said Vinod.
