NEW DELHI: India captain   was given out leg before wicket by the on-field umpire   during the second innings and immediately batsman reviewed the decision on Day 3 of the second Test against Australia in Bengaluru. 

 At first look, it seems the Indian has nicked the ball before it crashed on to the front pad.  , the bowler and his team-mates were pretty convinced and so did Kohli who looked quite confident when signalling for the Decision Review System (DRS). 
 
 But, as it turned out it was much more complicated. The ball was pitched outside off and hit Kohli in front but it was unclear whether the ball thudded onto the pads before or after taking an edge from the bat. From one angle it looked as if both the events had occurred simultaneously.
 
 However, the   projection showed the ball would have gone on to hit the stumps. With no clear evidence suggesting whether or not there was a nick involved before the impact, the third umpire told Llong to stick with his decision. Kohli, expectedly, wasn't impressed and his body language while walking back to the dressing room cleared what he thought of the decision.
