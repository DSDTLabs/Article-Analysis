 aka Sunny, who plays Nil Sen in the serial  , is happy to shoot indoors today. “The heat outside is too much to handle. We have a song sequence, which is generally shot outdoors. However today, Sandipta and I will be shooting indoors. We will be shooting some romantic scenes, where I will confess to my wife how important she is in my life — that I can’t live without her. I will also be seen strumming a guitar. I love to play guitar in real life too,” said the actor.
