Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Tuesday adjourned the matter pertaining to admissions to MBBS seats at Goa Medical College to next week. The high court said that the “extended time is provided for the students who lost out on an MBBS seat this year”. The court is waiting for the statement of these students who couldn’t get admissions due to 11 late applicants being provided MBBS seats.

 The 11 late applicants were provided admissions after some of them approached the high court stating that they were not aware that admissions to MBBS seats by the state would be carried out before the results to NEET were announced. In an interim order in the matter, the high court asked a provisional merit list to be prepared, including the late applicants. In another interim order, the directorate of technical education (DTE) was asked to fill the MBBS seats at Goa Medical College, based on this provisional list.
 
 During the following hearings, the high court asked DTE to submit a report on the number of late applicants who had received admissions due to the interim order and the names of those students who lost out on a seat due to the late applicants getting admissions. DTE, in its report, said that 11 lost out on a seat due to the late applicants being admitted.
 
 Five of the students who lost out on a seat filed an intervention petition. Based on this petition, the high court has asked for notices to be served to all students who have lost out on an MBBS seat to submit their statement before the high court.
