GURUGRAM: The   on Tuesday morning resulted in a massive traffic jam after   blocked   Road and Golf Course Road (extension), throwing the life of residents out of gear. The traffic movement from   Chowk to   Chowk came to a grinding halt and snarls were witnessed till late afternoon.

 Office-goers and students faced problems due to the blockade. “The blockade started around 9:30am which is when people leave for office or school. Traffic in the area is managed by a private security firm and the moment the crowd started getting out of hand, the security guards fled the scene. The situation remained tense till noon and it was time for kids to come back from school. I got really scared about the safety of my child who goes to pre-school as no information was being given to us and we took to Twitter to get updates and help out people who were stuck,” said Amit Saxena, a resident of Tupil White in Sector 69 who was stuck in the chaos for a long time.
 
 Residents also complained about the slow response of cops. “The traffic was chaotic after protesters blocked roads for nearly three hours. The police came to the spot very late,” said Himanshu, a resident of  , Sector 70.
 
 Several office-goers stuck in traffic reached their workplaces very late. “I was stuck at Subhash   for over two hours as the traffic just did not move. It is ridiculous that a bunch of people can hold the entire city to ransom. There was no information from the police on avoiding this road,” said Preeti Singh who works in a nearby IT firm.
 
 Traffic officials said that vehicles were diverted to a stretch of Golf Course Road (Extension) and then rerouted to Rajiv Chowk. “All possible measures were taken to keep the traffic smooth despite the blockade,” claimed a senior traffic official.
