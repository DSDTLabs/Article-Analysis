CHANDIGARH: Eight years on, street-light poles are still to be installed on the bases that were constructed at the Industrial Area Phase I. The authorities concerned seem disinterested in completing this work. 

 During a visit to the area, a TOI team found out that the road located near the office of the subdivisional magistrate (east) still has those stree-light-pole bases that were built almost eight years ago and till date remain bare. No street-light pole was ever installed on these. The local industrialists complained that they had been demanding for proper street lights on thge V-5 roads but since the work was left unfinished, they feel unsafe stepping out on dark streets after late shifts.
 
 Industrialists said the MC had hried a private contractor to install street-light poles on the road from the poultry farm to the railway station. But majority of the times, these lights near Industrial Area Phase I are not operational. Even the light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs installed by the civic authorities are out of order usually. Local industrialist   said: "It has become a routine for the industrialists to make complaints to the authorities concewned, but all in vain, as there is never any action.
 
 Another industrialist, Surinder Mahajan of the Industrial Area Phase I, said: "For the past one month, our street lights are not working properly and the bigger problem is that there is nobody to repair these, even after we have made a number of complaints to the department concerned. The members of our staff find it scary to take these roads after finishing late shifts." A memorandum has been submitted to mayor Davesh Moudgil as well and the industrialists hope the at the municipal corporation and the area councillor will look into it and resolve the issue at the earliest, for the sake of both industrialists and dailycommuters.
