GURUGRAM :   is going to clean a water storage tank at the   (WTP) to increase their storage capacity, in order to meet the city’s water requirements during summer. 

 The effort is estimated to cost Huda Rs 1.25 crore, for which the authority will call a tender in the next two weeks.
 
 Basai WTP has six storage tanks, which are around 5m deep. They are filled with up to 2-3m of mud and silt. The six storage tanks have a combined capacity of 300 MG. Of the six storage tanks, two have storage capacity of 70 million gallons each, while the other four have storage capacity of 40 MG each. 
 
 These storage tanks have capacity to supply water to Gurgaon for five days in case of an emergency or breakdown. But due to mud and silt, their storage capacity has reduced by 40%, and at present, they can supply water for only three days.
 
 “We found that the tanks need to be cleaned immediately, to restore their full storage capacity,” said a Huda official. 
 
 Around 100 cusecs of water arrives at Basai for treatment every day from Sonipat through the   Channel. 
 
 Around 60 MGD of water is supplied to Gurgaon and the remaining is stored at the plant. 
 
 Along with water, the Gurgaon Water Channel also carries mud to the treatment plant, and over time, it setles at the bottom of the storage tanks.
 
 According to an estimate, the storage tanks have 50,000 to 1 lakh truckloads of mud. Huda has recently written to all concerned departments that they can take the mud from the WTP while the storage tanks are cleaned.
 
 Huda informed its head office about the need to clean all the storage tanks, but till now, head office has given clearance and funds to clean only one of the six tanks. 
 
 “We’re going to call a tender in the next two weeks. During the cleaning exercise, water supply from that particular tank will be stopped,” said Huda executive engineer B Singh.
