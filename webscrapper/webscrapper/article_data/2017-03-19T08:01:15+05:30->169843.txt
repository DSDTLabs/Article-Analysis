BHOPAL: Governor   removed vice-chancellor of   Tariq Zafar on Saturday. MPPSC exam controller   has succeeded Zafar. Sources said Zafar was removed as he attained 65 years of age, which is the superannuation age to hold the office of VC. 

 Zafar was not stepping down despite completing maximum age. Zafar courted a string of controversies after he regularised 80 contract employees, sources said. Audit had raised objection and directed to recover Rs 3 crore from him. Zafar was under the scanner after the audit department raised objections. 
 
 Kanhere will remain in the office till further order or up to the age of 65, whichever is earlier, an official said. An inquiry is likely to begin against Zafar, sources said.
