Coimbatore: Thanks to the proactive measures adopted by the city police, the number of fatal road accidents registered in the city in the first month of the year has come   drastically. Data available with the city police show that only 15 causalities were reported between January 1 and 28 compared to 22 in January, 2017.

 City police commissioner K Periaiah credited the   for bringing down the number of fatal accidents by installing barricades on the Sitra–Chinniyampalayam stretch of the busy Avinashi Road. “Vehicle heading towards Tirupur surpass the speed limit of 100kmph-120 kmph after crossing the Sitra signal. As a result, people were finding it difficult to cross the Thoppampatti Pirivu and RG Pudur Junction. Most of the fatal accidents happened when pedestrians tried to cross the busy stretch. So, we kept barricades on the stretch to reduce the flow of traffic. We plan to install three more traffic signals on the stretch,” he told reporters on Monday.
 
 Police have identified 21 accident blackspots, including Kurichi ‘Y’ Junction, Eachanari Rail Overbridge, Madukkarai Market Road, Olympus Junction, Saravanampatti-Thudiyalur Junction, AG Pudur Junction, Sitra Junction and Lakshmi Mills Junction, Periaiah said.
 
 While police registered 22,331 cases, including 18,898 cases for not wearing helmets and 3,433 for not wearing seat belts this year, only 10,788 cases were registered in this category in the same period, last year.
 
 While as many as 3,990 cases were registered for red light violation, using mobile phones while driving, drunken driving, carrying passengers in goods vehicle and carrying overload in goods vehicles this year, only 1,840 cases were registered in January, 2017.
 
 As per the data, there was no change in the number of non-fatal accidents. As many as 77 people suffered grievous injuries in the same period last year also.
