BENGALURU: The entire process of devising the Comprehensive Development Plan or Revised Master Plan 2031, followed by the public consultations that were held by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), have collectively been a sham. In fact, it is in violation of our constitution. Since the   has no qualified planners in its ranks, it hires private consultants, who are likely to toe the line of the agency. 

 Until recently, the BDA did not even hold the consultation meetings properly. But as a result of heightened citizen awareness, the agency is holding these consultations for namesake. It's obvious that the master plan is unlikely to be changed significantly. The fundamental assumptions and the basis of the planning process are suspect. None of the studies is in the public domain.
 
 So what should be done?
 
 The government needs to be called out for its contempt for the constitution. It should dissolve the BDA, and merge it with the BBMP. The   (MPC), and the   ( ) need to be empowered.   should be authorised to start the planning exercise from scratch. All the studies need to be made available in the public domain before the planning process starts. The MPC must have a dedicated in-house team of qualified and experienced urban planner satits disposal . I t shouldn't be entrusted to private consultants, who have their own agenda.
 
 Most importantly , the system of local self-government must be restored. This will be possible only if the   is handed the complete mandate for running the city, and planning for it. WLPCs must be empowered to plan for every ward, and their inputs must be considered for the City Master Plan.
