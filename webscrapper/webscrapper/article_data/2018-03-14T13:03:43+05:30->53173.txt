NAGPUR: With just 19 days left for this fiscal to end, the recovery from property tax has been way below the desired levels, leading to missing cash strapped Nagpur Municipal Corporationâ€™s ( ) revenue targets. To improve the pace, the civic administration has decided to withhold salaries of employees in tax department.

 The revenue collection has slowed down this year with the civic body able to only garner only around Rs 1,300 crore revenue by the end of February against the revised target of Rs 1997.33 crore.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner   has now warned of stern action against tax department officials in all 10 zones if the recovery does not improve.
 
 He has asked the accounts and finance department not to release salaries of tax department staffers until his office reviews the tax collections zone wise. NMC has recovered Rs 189 crore as property tax by end of February against the annual target of Rs 564 crore.
