Bhopal: For the fourth straight year, the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) budget did not levy any additional tax burden on the people. Presenting the civic body’s budget for 2018-19 on Saturday, mayor Alok Sharma walked a tightrope and tried to maintain fiscal discipline, clearing indicating that increasing BMC’s income was not a priority, at least this year. He said, “More than half of the schemes mentioned in the budget are underway or were mentioned previously. It is a realistic budget and does not make tall claims that cannot be fulfilled.”  Taking note of the acute water crisis in Kolar, the mayor allocated Rs 136 crore to streamline water supply in one of the most densely populated areas of the city. “The allocation has been done to replace gravity main and feeder main pipelines in Kolar. Also, for the Kolar sewage treatment and disposal plant, Rs 85 crore has been allocated”, he said.  Regarding water supply to Huzur Bhauri, the budget proposed Rs 17 crore. “The project will benefit about 75,000 households,” said the mayor, adding that the mnuch-needed storm water drainage system has been allocated a sum of Rs 125 crore. The budget which was passed without discussion amid furore drew instant flak from the opposition Congress. “BMC is not in a position to make its contribution of 16% in funding for AMRIT project. None of the projects would be a reality given BMC’s financial health. Most of the projects are being completed through money received for smart city development,” said corporator Girish Sharma.
