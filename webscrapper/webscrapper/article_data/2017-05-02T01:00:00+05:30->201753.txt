 is all set to return as Subhash Nagre in ' ', the third installment of the Ram Gopal Varma-directed franchise. One of the main highlights of the upcoming film is a soulful   aarti, rendered by Big B. The song, composed by Rohan Vinayak, will be launched today. Shot on a Mumbai beach, the track, set during Ganpati visarjan, features a larger-than-life multi-headed idol of the elephant God. 

  
  
 Talking about the song, Bachchan says, “There is something about the '  Aarti' that invokes great divinity; an emotion, that is rare and lasting. Sant Ramdas created this aarti in the 1600s in a raag (Raag Jogiya), that was befitting of great character and eminence. The words are in vernacular Marathi — a rarity for most other Hindu bhajans and devotional songs. Yet, the way the aarti has been structured, it cuts across all language barriers, if at all there are any.” As for lending his voice to it, he adds, “I feel privileged and blessed, to have been asked to sing it for 'Sarkar 3'. I sang the aarti for the Siddhivinayak Mandir at Prabhadevi, and when I discussed it with  , I suggested that we do the same for the film as well. We have given it a different tone, but the sentiment, the emotion and the divinity remain in as much prominence as the original.”
