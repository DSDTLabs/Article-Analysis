HYDERABAD: In a case of suspected food poisoning, a 15-year-old student of a madrassa for girls in   town died on Friday, while 13 others were hospitalised after they consumed khichdi. The madrassa is not recognised by the state government, a senior official said.

 Soon after having breakfast at the madrassa in   on the outskirts of the town, the students started vomiting and complained of diarrhoea.
 
 They were rushed to the government hospital in Nizamabad where Sumaya Firdous died. She hailed from   in Kamareddy town.
 
 District medical and health officer   said that the girls are out of danger. “The 13 girls who had vomiting and loose motions are undergoing treatment and are out of danger,” he said.
 
 Three girls have been discharged. Dr Venkat said that they are not sure about the cause of death of Firdous. Officials collected the food and water samples from the madrassa and sent them to the Institute of Preventive Medicine, Hyderabad, for analysis.
 
 Meanwhile, parents blamed insanitary conditions and crowded hostels for the food poisoning.
 
 “The madrassa management did not inform us about the incident,” a parent bemoaned. District minority welfare officer   visited the madrassa and made inquiries. Police registered a case and launched a probe into the circumstances that led to the poisoning.
