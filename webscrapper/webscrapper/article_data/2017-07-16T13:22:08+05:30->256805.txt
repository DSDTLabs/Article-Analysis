COIMBATORE: The rural police increased the number of police personnel deployed at the 12 Tamil Nadu-Kerala border checkposts from Saturday to prevent   and river sand to Kerala.

 Coimbatore district superintendent of police Pa Moorthy, who took charge last week, ordered tighter security mainly at four checkposts — Walayar, Velanthavalam, Ramapattinam and Meenakshipuram. 
 
 “These four checkposts see most of the vehicle movement between the states. So we have deployed one sub-inspector and six police constables, including armed police, in shifts to check vehicles round the clock to curtail smuggling of river sand and ration rice to Kerala,” said Pa Moorthy.
 
 Besides, the Nadupuni checkpost will get one sub-inspector and four police constables and the other seven checkposts will each get two constables in shifts. The seven checkposts are: Mangarai, Pattisalai, Veerappagoundenpudur, Vadakkukadu, Zaminkaliyapuram, Chemmanampathy and Mulli. 
 
 Following Maoist movement in the border near Anaikatti, police have deployed armed police at Mangarai.
 
 “Each checkpost has CCTV cameras with in-house recording facilities. And we are setting up a modern control room linking all the CCTV cameras from the 12 checkposts,” said SP Moorthy. Also, police are planning to link the CCTV cameras installed in  ,   and other areas in the district.
