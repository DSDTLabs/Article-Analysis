JAIPUR:   National Park’s iconic tigress   (1997-2016) that died in August 2016, continues to live in wildlife lovers heart and soul. Thursday evening screening of ‘World’s most famous Tiger’ documentary on Machli by S  , a wildlife cinematographer-director-producer, saw a packed house. And so much was the demand that the   had to run a subsequent show, to quench the crowd’s urge to see the ‘Tiger Queen of Ranthambhore.’

 The documentary, ‘World’s most famous Tiger’ depicts the latter part of Machli’s life with a different perspective. “The movie tells Machli’s story from 10-19 years of age and finally how she was laid to rest. Parts of the other three movies, ‘Tiger Queen’ ‘Tiger revenge’ and ‘Tiger Dynasty’ have been assimilated in this movie but only 5-10 per cent. The movie revolves around Machli and the dominant male, T-2 that died sometime when Machli was 16 years of age. It shows the struggle that the tigress went through in her later age when her offsprings shunted her out of her own territory when she could not fend for herself,” said  . 
 
 The 60-minute film has been shot over a period of nine years. The film follows the life of greatest tigress that ever lived. The plot follows the rise, fall and ultimate death of the star of Ranthambore. Machhli lived up to her legacy as one of the oldest tigers to have survived in the wild up till an astounding age of 19 years. Till her death, she remained the unparalleled Queen of Ranthambore having outwitted massive opponents and living longer than any  .
