PATNA: The   (NHAI) is expected to start work on much-awaited Buxar-  (NH-30 and NH-84)   in April following the clearance of land acquisition hurdles. Besides, work is expected to expedite on Patna- Gaya-Dobhi four-lane project as well. 

 The two projects have been stuck for the past couple of years owing to land acquisition problems. The NHAI has recently released sufficient funds as per Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, which envisages nearly four times compensation to the landowners. The state government recently committed to the NHAI to expediting land acquisition for the two projects by making speedy disbursement of funds received for the purpose.
 
 “Funds have been released for acquisition of 70% of the land required for Buxar-Patna project. Besides, land acquisition is going on at a rapid pace for Patna-Gaya-Dobhi (NH-83) project as well. Sufficient funds for land acquisition for both the projects have been provided to the state government,” said a senior NHAI official here.
 
 Prime Minister   had laid the foundation stone for the four-lane road connecting Patna and   on August 18, 2015. The NHAI has divided the 125km-long project into three parts — Patna to Koilwar, Koilwar to Bhojpur and Bhojpur to Buxar.
 
 NHAI sources said land has already been acquired for 70km out of the 126km-long Patna-Gaya-Dobhi project. “Land acquisition process is under way for another 25km stretch of this project. Meanwhile, work is already going on 28km of this project and patchwork has been completed,” the NHAI official said.
 
 The NHAI entered into an agreement with IL & FS in November, 2014, for executing this project. NHAI sources said Rs1,028 crore out of the total Rs2,274 crore has been disbursed till date for land acquisition in Gaya, Jehanabad and Patna districts.
