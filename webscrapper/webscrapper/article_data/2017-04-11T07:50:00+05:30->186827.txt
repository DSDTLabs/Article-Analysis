Gurgaon: The ‘HCL Concerts’ festival was well received, with more than 7,000 turning up for the shows across the three venues. But in Gurgaon, the music festival concluded a little unsatisfactorily, leaving many disappointed.

 The auditorium at Shiv Nadar School was full well before the show was due to begin, yet a crowd could still be seen trying to enter the school’s gates. Entry was free to what was billed as a “mega” concert, and there was no limit to the number of people who could register online to attend the shows. 
 
 “We advise our audience to be seated an hour prior to the concert as entry is on first-come, first-served basis, and the auditorium is closed once it is fully occupied for security purposes,” said Sundar Mahalingam, chief strategy officer, HCL Corporation and Shiv Nadar Foundation.
 
 “While we are happy with the overwhelming response we received for this edition of our Mega Concert, we are also conscious of the fact that not all our patrons were able to experience the performances due to space constraints withinthe auditoriums,” Mahalingam explained.
