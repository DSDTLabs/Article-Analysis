GURUGRAM: In a rare occasion for stargazers, on Wednesday they can see not only a   and a super moon, but also a total  , all rolled into one. 

 The eclipse will best be visible in India at 6pm. Dr Mila Mitra, scientific officer,  , said, “A blue moon is when two full moons happen in the same calendar month; lunar eclipses occur when the moon passes into Earth’s shadow. In this case, the super moon (it looks bigger than an average full moon, and happens when a full or new moon is near the moon’s closest approach to Earth) also happens to be the day of the lunar eclipse.”
 
 To make this event more memorable, Space India will put a telescope in Gurugram’s DAV Public School, Sector 49. Charu  , principal, said, “This is not an open event for everyone to come and see, but people can come through invitation. We will provide views of the eclipsed moon and elucidate the phases to the students.”
 
 There hasn’t been a triple line-up like this since 1982 and the next won’t occur until 2037. 
 
 Space India, an NGO which works to promote scientific knowledge among children, will conduct an observation at India Gate, New Delhi on January 31 from 6pm to 8.30pm.
