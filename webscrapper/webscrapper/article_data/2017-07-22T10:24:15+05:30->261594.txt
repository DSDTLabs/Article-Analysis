AHMEDABAD: Leaders of Gujarat   went into a huddle after Shankersinh   announced his resignation from the party. Sources said that the party leaders discussed how to deal with the situation if other Congress MLAs also quit. The election of a new leader of opposition also came in for discussion.

 The Congress has decided not to risk Vaghela loyalists in positions of authority in the party's district bodies as they may act against the party in the upcoming elections. Vaghela may try to use them against the Congress in the 2017 assembly elections.Hence, the party also discussed how to neutralise Vaghela loyalists at the earliest.
 
 Bapu (as Vaghela is popu larly known) has proved his ability to hurt the Congress's interest as 11 MLAs of the party cross-voted for NDA's presidential nominee. He also claims that he has the support of at least 15-20 MLAs.
 
 On Friday, after Vaghela publically criticized the Congress, Gujarat Congress core committee headed by state party president Bharatsinh Solanki avoided the   office in Paldi, Ahmedabad and did not meet journalists.
 
 In the evening, Congress leaders, reportedly after con sultation with the party high command in Delhi, started speaking to journalists and launched a counter-attack against Vaghela.
 
 On Thursday itself, after sensing that Vaghela planned to leave the party, the Congress had directed all its MLAs to avoid going to Vaghela's show. Hence, only two MLAs -Vaghela's son Mahendrasinh and Raghavji Patel -attended the s how. However around 10-12 MLAs met Vaghela at the   residential quarters in the morning ahead of the latter's `birthday bash'. Raghavji Patel is a Vaghela associate from RJP days.
 
 Gujarat Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki had asked all MLAs to be present at the PCC meeting. Till late in the evening on Friday , all the key office-bearers of the party were in denial mode.
