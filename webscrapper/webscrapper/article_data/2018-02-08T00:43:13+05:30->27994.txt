MUMBAI: Coming together in  , the   and the   on Wednesday rejected a proposal to construct a jetty at   by acquiring a portion of   (auditorium) plot. They asked the BJP-led state government to look for an alternative location for the jetty.

 The proposed jetty is part of Union shipping minister Nitin Gadkari’s plan to develop the city’s waterfront for leisure, entertainment and hospitality. This also includes a plan for floating hotels (ships) around two nautical miles off the Raj Bhavan. The government want to construct a jetty at Girgaum Chowpatty for easy access to the flotel. Gadkari had asked the state government to help the floatel initiative.
 
 Subsequently, the state government zeroed in on a 5,853 sq mtr plot adjoining the Girgaum Chowpatty where Birla Krida Kendra stands. The plot originally belongs to the state government, which had, in 1956, and given it to BMC on a 99-year lease.
 
 As the government wants a portion of the plot for building the jetty before the lease expires, it sent a request to BMC. On Wednesday, the proposal came before the BMC Improvement Committee. 
 
 Committee chairman Anant Nar (Sena) said, “For years, citizens have been using the auditorium for cultural activities. There is no need to destroy it for a jetty, so we rejected the proposal.”
 
 Committee member Ashraf Azmi (Congress) said, “We opposed the proposal as it’s against the people. The auditorium is used to promote local culture and drama. It was closed a few years ago and needs to be reopened after repairs. The government should not destroy the cultural centre for luxuries activities.”
 
 BJP members said the proposal was to just take a small portion of the plot, and not the entire area. BJP corporator Prakash Gangadhare said, “Gadkari wants to develop the sea-front to promote tourism. The proposed jetty will be very helpful for citizens, but the Sena and Congress opposed it for no reason. They are anti-development.”
