Veteran director Bharathan's son Sidharth Bharathan is back in action after a near fatal accident in September 2015. The young director who had proved his mettle by directing movies such as Chandrettan Evideya and Nidra, is all set to take movie buffs for a 'hilarious fun ride' through his next movie!
The film titled Varnyathilashanka Athu Than Allayo... Ithu, has  , Chemban Vinod, Suraj Venjaramood, Shine Tom Chacko and Sharafudheen playing central characters. 'The film is a satirical take on today's society told through the story of five men from a village in Kerala. Every Malayali will be able to identify with the characters,' says Sidharth.
 
  The movie is scripted by theatre person Thrissur Gopalji, and is in an out-and-out entertainer. 'The actors will make you laugh out loud rolling on the floor. Every second is filled with fun. It is going to be hilarious,' says Sidharth adding that the film doesn't have a heroine as such.
  The title of the film has been adapted from the Malayalam Alankaram (figure of speech) Utpreksha. 'Yes, like the description of Utpreksha, the movie will also have some peculiarities. The film will give you a taste of the writings of V K N, who was noted mainly for his high-brow satire,' he adds. The movie will go on floors by the end of April in Thrissur.
