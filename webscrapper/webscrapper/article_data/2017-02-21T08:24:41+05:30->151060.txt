KOCHI:  , the former head of the famed   in Mumbai, who visited the   on Monday found 'a kind of playfulness' to the  .

 “It feels as if the artists are playing with the ideas of what visitors can see, what they can perceive and what the truth is.
 
 There are so much more immersive and experien tial exhibits this time,“ said Kapoor.
 
 Kapoor who has visited the Biennale earlier as well, felt that the art fest cannot be confined to a single day's tour.
 
 “At least three days are needed to experience this spectacle entirely,“ Kapoor said.
 
 Of the performances she partook during her visit to primary venue  , Kapoor said Lundahl and Seitl's 'blindfold tour' installation `Symphony of a Missing Room: An Imagined Museum' stood out.
 
 “The idea, the implementation and the way I was guided and instructed about what to hear and what not to see.The most fascinating part of that work is the trust that it demands. I had to put faith in the person who guided me, to trust the whole concept of the artist. For me, it is an important work at a time when people are cynical and sceptical about everything,“ she said.
