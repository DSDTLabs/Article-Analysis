CHENNAI: Ford   Company has been named one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for the eighth straight year by   Institute. This is the longest winning streak by any auto company. 

 The list of the World’s Most Ethical Companies acknowledges and honours companies that recognise that they have a role in society to influence or drive a positive change. These companies consider their employees, investors, customers and other key stakeholders when taking action, while their values and culture align with the decisions they make every day.
 
 “Companies we’ve honoured as World’s Most Ethical take a novel response to the shift in societal expectations, constant redefinition of laws and regulations, and the geo-political climate,” said Timothy Erblich, Ethisphere’s chief executive officer. 
 
 “We’ve seen how   responds to these challenges, while still investing in communities where they reside and embracing ethical strategies across the globe, as a sustainable business advantage.”
 
 Ford won the top spot on the basis of programmes aimed at monitoring human rights and safe working conditions, sourcing conflict-free minerals, to programmes such as the Partnership for a Cleaner Environment, which is aimed at encouraging sustainability through Ford’s supply chain. 
 
 Efforts to foster long-term relationships with suppliers through active engagement, which includes sharing best practices, as well as providing training and evaluations to ensure suppliers meet both legal requirements and Ford standards was also counted as a plus.
 .
 “Strong ethics and corporate citizenship are the foundation of our business philosophy, which demonstrates to our customers what we stand for as a company,” said Bill Ford, Ford Motor Company Executive Chairman. “This honour is a reflection of Ford’s core values, and it shows that our employees are continuing to make the right decisions every day for all of our stakeholders.”
