RAJKOT: Frequent fliers can hope for more flights from the city this year.

 The   (AAI) has given its nod to expand the airport terminal, which, at present has a capacity of handling only 140 passengers at a time. 
 
 As a result, two flights cannot land at the same time. If one flight lands and other has to take off within few minutes, the situation gets chaotic at the terminal.
 
 The airport is already getting congested as the number of fliers are increasing day by day. 
 
 The new airport, sanctioned at  , about 25km from the city, will take at least six years to become operational.
 
 Airport director   told TOI, “We have got in-principle approval to expand the terminal and will be floating tenders for the work soon. After expansion, the terminal will be able to handle 350 passengers at a time.”
 
 Currently, five flights operate daily from Rajkot to Mumbai and Delhi. They are scheduled with a sufficient gap between two flights. 
 
 The terminal expansion work is expected to be completed by October 2018. When a bigger terminal comes up, more flights may start operating from   in the winter schedule looking at the growing demand. 
 
 The runway of the airport is also not sufficient which is why airlines can’t operate with full occupancy. Though an   has capacity to carry 180 passenger, it can carry only around 120 to 130 passengers.
