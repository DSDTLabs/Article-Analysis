MUMBAI: Commuters on the   had a harrowing time on Friday morning after a point failure led to 20 suburban services getting cancelled. 

 A point is a section of the track that enables a train to change from one line to another. Point failures could occur due to several causes including cable failure or if there's something wrong on the track.
 
 A WR official said, "The point failure occurred on Up and Down fast lines at 8.15 am. It was resolved around 8.47 am. Apart from 20 cancellations, 100 services were delayed."
 
 Even a minor failure during morning peak hours can lead to major chaos on the Western Railway which runs trains at a frequency of 3-4 minutes in that period.
 
 This was the second disturbance on WR in a span of 12 hours. Services were badly hit on Thursday after a failure in the locomotive of August Kranti Express around 6 pm.
 
 Commuters took to social media to vent their anger.   commuter Amol Naik said, "My train took almost 50 minutes to reach from Jogeshwari to Elphinstone Road."
 
 Dahisar commuter   said, "I could not board several trains because of overcrowding due to the delay."
 
 Many decided to take the road to reach their offices.   resident   said, "I decided use the car-pooling services of a cab aggregator to reach Andheri. The journey was time-consuming, but I was not sure when train services would normalise either. Also, the platform was almost overflowing with passengers."
