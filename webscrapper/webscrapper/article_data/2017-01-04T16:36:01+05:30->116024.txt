BHOPAL: The dense fog in the state capital has thrown out of gear schedule of many airlines leaving emergency travelers stranded. On Tuesday, an Air India flight from Delhi had to hover around the airport for 20 minutes before attempting landing due to fog. 

 Poor visibility has made landing difficult at   that has led to demands for higher version of   (ILS) at the city airport. 
 
 Presently, Raja Bhoj airport is equipped with ILS CAT1 facility.
 
 Fog had forced cancellation of a Mumbai bound   flight in the morning on Monday while two other flights of Air India were delayed by about five hours.
 
 Regular fliers and aviation experts demand   2 facility at Raja Bhoj airport.
 
 ILS is a ground-based instrument approach system that provides precision guidance to an aircraft approaching and landing on a runway, using a combination of radio signals to enable a safe landing during instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), such as low ceilings or reduced visibility due to fog, rain, or blowing snow.
 
 When contacted, director, Raja Bhoj airport, Akashdeep Mathur said airport has ILS CAT 1 facility.
 
 ILS CAT 1 is a basic system. CAT 1 is a precision instrument approach and landing with a decision height not lower than 60 m (200 ft) and with either a visibility not less than 800 m or a runway visual range not less than 550 m.
 
 CAT 2 is precision instrument approach and landing with a decision height lower than 60 m (200 ft), but not lower than 30 m (100 ft) and a runway visual range not less than 300 m. There are other two higher versions, CAT 3 A and CAT 3B for better results.
 
 International flights for Jeddah for Haj pilgrims do operate from Bhopal airport every year.
 
 CAT 1 facility was installed at Bhopal airport in 2013 and the glidepath relocated at the Raja Bhoj airport runway to 50 ft from 45ft to facilitate safe landing during poor visibility.
