JAIPUR: Rajasthan police is mulling over making its police stations, offices of   (IGP), Superintendent of Police and its training institutes across the state tobacco-free by the end of this year. Senior police officers through video conferencing and awareness camps have instructed their subordinates to comply with the same.

 DGP Manoj Bhatt has already asked all senior officers to refrain from bringing tobacco products in the premises of state police headquarters (PHQ). 
 
 “It is not that we will use some punishment. It is a gradual process as we are organising camps and have roped in specialist doctors who are teaching our men about the ill-effects of tobacco. In a recent   with the IGs and SPs of state, a team of doctors highlighted the ill-effects of tobacco and its products,” Bhatt told TOI.
 
 Senior police officers, including B L Soni, ADG, directed police officers to ensure that selling of tobacco products is discouraged. 
 
 Bhatt further said that at police training institutes, police headquarters and many other police wings, use of tobacco is already prohibited. Addressing a video conference, Dr  , cancer surgeon, SMS Hospital, said that in the past seven years, the number of tobacco users has reduced. According to latest GATS report, there were 34.6% tobacco users in 2009-10. Now, it has reduced to 28.6%.
