SURAT: The Diamond City will host a two-day-long Diamond Detection Expo & Symposium (DDES) 2017 to provide a platform for the trade to interact with developers of machines and technology for detection of natural diamonds and synthetic at Samast Patidar Samaj Bhavan at Katargam starting from April 14. 

 Regional chairman of Gems and   (GJEPC), Dinesh Navadiya strongly reiterated that Surat’s diamond industry stood firmly committed to taking all steps necesssary to prevent undisclosed mixing and establish separate footprints for natural and synthetic diamonds as this would help maintain consumer confidence in natural diamonds.
 
 First of its kind expo and symposium, DDES is being organised by GJEPC in association with Surat Diamond Association ( )
 
 The two-day event will have both knowledge sessions and actual displays of available machines, so that the industry can learn not only about what currently exists, but also about possible future developments. This would play an important part in helping to prepare a road map for strengthening consumer confidence in natural diamonds. 
 
 Navadiya said that the aim of the Council was to spread awareness about the issue and about steps that could be taken to prevent mixing, as well as to make detection technology accessible to the   which are such an important part of the industry.
 
 Though currently the production of synthetic diamonds is at very minimal levels (about 0.3 per cent of natural diamond production), Navadiya said that Council wanted to ensure that the industry is equipped and prepared even if production of synthetic diamonds increased rapidly and rose to say 3 per cent of natural diamond production.
 
 GJEPC chairman Praveen Shanker Pandya and convener of the   (NMDC), Ashish Mehta will be attending the two-day event to participate in the discussion on ‘Effect of synthetic diamonds on Surat’s diamond industry’ and panel discussion.
