NEW DELHI: A 26-year-old woman was murdered by two men in front of her husband, four children and hundreds of shoppers in a crowded weekly market in south east Delhi’s   on Thursday evening. 

 Suman Dubey, a housewife, was stabbed thrice after a fight broke out when her husband, Umesh, objected to the duo touching a woman standing before them, and then Suman, inappropriately. She died of excessive bleeding while being taken to hospital. Her attackers were arrested after a shopkeeper chased and caught one of them. 
 
 Ajay (23) and Bijender (24), both petty criminals, were trying to get fresh with one of the woman shoppers and subsequently Suman. Umesh, who is a   cabbie, objected to their advances and shouted at them. The two backed off only to return in a while and attack him with a knife. Crying for help, Suman tried to shield her husband and was stabbed in her chest, back and an arm in the process. Ajay and Bijender started to flee. Raj Wadhwa, who owns of a car repair shop nearby, caught hold of one of them after chasing him for over half a kilometre. The man tried to stab Wadhwa but the latter overpowered him and pinned him down. Bystanders thrashed him and handed him over to cops.
 
 Cops were alerted about the incident in Budh bazaar on Ravidas Marg when one of the eyewitnesses made a PCR call around 8.50pm. 
 
 “A police team was rushed to the spot and the woman was taken to the hospital where the doctors declared her dead,” Chinmoy Biswal, DCP (south east), said. 
 
 Suman’s distraught sister Archana said, “Umesh saw his wife take the knife for him and he has constantly been blaming himself for not being able to protect her. Their children are inconsolable after seeing their mother being killed. They are terrified and refuse to eat anything,” she said. 
 
 Suman leaves behind four kids, aged between two and five.
