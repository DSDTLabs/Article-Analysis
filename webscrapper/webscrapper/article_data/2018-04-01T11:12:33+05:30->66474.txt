CHANDIGARH: Four times increase in parking rates in just four months has now started attracting a lot of criticism. The residents are questioning that since there was no upgradation, how can the UT administration, which falls under the   regime, support a four times rate hike in just four months? 

 "The rates are being increased and in return no facility upgradation is being provided. There is a limit to making holes in the pocket of a common man. We will hold an extensive protest against this move," said  , president of Chandigarh Congress.
 
 Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, which is an apex body of the city-based traders, on Saturday held an emergency meeting and strongly opposed the decision. The traders have decided to organise a protest rally on Monday against the unjustified increase of parking fee.
 
 President of CBM Anil   while criticizing the increase said that the move was a great financial burden to the traders and general public. 
 
 He also demanded free pick and drop facility for the shoppers.
 
 President of the Federation of Sectors Welfare Association of Chandigarh Baljinder   said, "The authority is only looting the public and harassing them in the name of revenue generation. 
 
 "There is nothing on the name of facility in the parking lots at all. It is just the entry fee and no parking. We will hold a protest against the increase of the paid parking charges."
 
 President of   said, "The MC should first provide facilities and then demand an increase."
