AHMEDABAD: If one wanted to experience the   of the living heritage in  , he should have joined the   and city tour that a bunch of Walled city residents had organised for children of salt-pan workers of the Little Rann of Kutch.

 On Sunday, 33 teenagers from Kharaghoda and Odu villages of the Rann travelled to the Walled City as guests of Raja Mehta ni pol and other local Walled City trader’s guilds. With the help of an NGO and a small funding from a club the children had a blast. They not only took a heritage walk, but a visit to the Sabarmati Ashram and enjoyed the fun rides at the Kankaria lake.
 
 Anubha Vijaysinh, a student of Odu village, said, “I saw the pols, the temples, bird-feeders and mosque. I never imagined a city will imbibe the qualities of a village like ours. I always imagined Ahmedabad to be intimidating with only cars, government officers and important people. When I came to pols I immediately felt at home.”
 
 The idea took root when a few families from Raja Mehta ni pol visited Kharaghoda area for a function. “We met these children, some of whose families had not visited Ahmedabad in three generations. It was then that we spoke to a local NGO, Ganatar, to help organise a tour for these children,” says Pankaj Bhatt a resident of Raja Mehta ni pol. 
 
 Once they returned, the families spoke to local business associations. First the Manek Chowk parking group came forward, the same day members of the Jain Jignasa Yuva Sangh joined and then members of the Lions Club to pitched in. 
 
 Nirupa Shah, director of Ganatar said, “The heritage walk made these children feel like they were at home. There is still a large section of Gujarat which is yet to visit their nearest Gujarat cities. The Walled City coming together for these children reflects the true Amdavadis spirit.”
