  “It almost feels like a real wedding. I’ll wear a multi-coloured lehenga with zardozi, kundan and gold work that weighs almost 30 kg and is worth Rs 10 lakh. Fifty embroiderers from across India have been working to make each kali stand out,” Samiksha tells Mirror, adding that she instantly fell in love with the outfit. “I felt like a princess in it even though it was difficult to shoot wearing it.”
  
  Meanwhile, the sequence was a nostalgia trip for Karan. “It’s fun to shoot for my onscreen wedding as it features many rituals that are similar to the ones from my real-life wedding. I’m sure that audiences will enjoy the wedding track,” he says.
