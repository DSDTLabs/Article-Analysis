MUMBAI: The Gujarati-dominated areas of   and   witnessed a huge turnout on Tuesday, perhaps because BJP has contested this election alone and the community is a vocal supporter of the party. The BJP is contesting 195 of the total 227 seats this civic election.

 In Ghatkopar, people had to queue up for almost an hour before they could cast their vote. Parul Shah, who was at the Gurukul School polling booth, said, “This is the longest that I have stood in a queue to vote. There is lot of awareness among the electorate about the importance of voting.” The turnout in Ghatkopar was 54.5%. 
 
 Anand Modi, a resident of Garodia Nagar, said, “The common man’s interest in politics has increased following the emergence of Prime Minister  . I am not saying that all those who have lined up will vote for BJP, but one thing is clear—the voter turnout is unsually high.”
 
 Pant Nagar’s Vijay Shah said, “Due to the saffron alliance, the seat in our area was allocated to   in 2012. A few of the votes may have been transferred to the Sena because of the alliance. Besides, in the last civic election, the turnout was low. This time round, since BJP has fielded its own candidate, more voters from our community have turned up.”
 
 The community came out in larger numbers in the four electoral wards of Mulund West; the turnout was over 60%. Sources said there was a good turnout of those from highrises. BJP MP   said, “For the first time in 25 years, the middle-class   have come out in maximum numbers.”
