NEW DELHI:   (India) likely to be divided into two units as the government is not happy with the state-run player's performance. The marketing operations could be separated into a new entity. Sources told TOI that the plan is being discussed in the petroleum ministry as the government is unhappy with the PSU's performance in building a pipeline network in addition to a possible conflict of interest in its role as the infrastructure provider as well as a carrier.

 The plan to split the company, which was set up mainly to develop gas sector infrastructure in the country, has been discussed in the past too, including by Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, but it did not materialise.
 
 
 
 
 * Natural gas transmission and marketing are the core businesses of GAIL (India), which has also diversified into petrochemicals and renewable energy. Last year, the PSU earned over 70 per cent revenue from marketing operations, while over 40 per cent of the profit came from natural gas transmission.
 
 * The deal will help the government garner around Rs 35,000 crore by way of disinvestment receipts. The sources, however, said the government would first prefer to unbundle GAIL before deciding on consolidation.
 
 * The discussions come at a time when the government is working on completing ONGC acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) to bolster both the entities. ONGC is currently in the process of acquiring the governmentâ€™s 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL, which at current prices is worth over Rs 33,000 crore.
 
 * Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) are both keen to acquire gas utility GAIL (India) to become fully integrated energy companies. 
 
 * IOC and BPCL have separately indicated to the petroleum ministry their interest in taking over GAIL to help add natural gas transportation and marketing business to their kitty, official sources said.
 
 
 
 
 * GAIL, on the other hand, feels a merger with oil and gas producer ONGC would be more appropriate.
 
 * The merger options were indicated following Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's announcement in the last year Union Budget speech on the government's plan to create integrated public sector oil majors that will be "able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies".
 
 * The merger might help the bigger oil companies to compete with global giants and withstand oil price volatility.
