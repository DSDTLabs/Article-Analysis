Both   and the   will be desperately looking to find the winning rhythm when they clash in Mumbai. Both have lost games by narrow margins and while that is usually expected in the T20 format, when it happens regularly then there is a need to look at why it’s happening.

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 Hyderabad are handicapped by the loss of their dynamic opening batsman  . The left-hander invariably gets the team off to a flying start but more crucially he stays for the major part of the innings and keeps the momentum going and takes a heavy load on himself. 
 
 Their skipper Kane Williamson played a truly brilliant innings against the Chennai Super Kings but was unable to find support from the others.
 
 
 
 
 
 The problem with their team is that they have one match wonders who keep their places for the next year even as they do precious little in between.It’s hard to expect the seniors to pull the team out of trouble always. 
 
 With David Warner also unavailable, the pressure on Dhawan and Williamson is just too much. If Manish Pandey, who is a superb player, can strike form then the pressure will ease considerably. Mumbai are struggling mainly because their bowlers have not quite delivered. 
 
 Bumrah bowled an inspired second spell against Rajasthan Royals and Hardik Pandya also came up with wickets that almost turned the game Mumbai’s way. Young Markande is bowling well but other teams have studied him well. PMG/ESP
