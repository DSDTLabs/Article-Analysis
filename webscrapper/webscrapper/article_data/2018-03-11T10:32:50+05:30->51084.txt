JAIPUR: About 100 women have been sitting in dharna at a narrow lane in  , about a km from the office of the CPI-M at Hatwara Road, Hasanpura, in the state capital, for over a week. The women demand that local authorities shut down the illegal   vend operating from a house in the area for several years. Sunita  , one of the women at the spot, told TOI: “The business is happening from a house. There are no timings for sale, no rules are observed. Even children buy alcohol because of its easy availability. 

 We have been sending letters and pleading with authorities to act in the matter, but the family that is engaged in the business seems quite adept at getting officials to turn a blind eye to the rampant violation of norms. Quite apart from the loss to the state exchequer because of this illegal sale and loss of revenue, there are other serious social consequences to this activity. Households in the area are middle-class, and they cannot afford to spend on alcohol. Despite women sitting on dharna since the end of February, nothing has happened so far.”
 
  of the CPI-M and other leaders were also present at the dharna spot on Thursday, to express solidarity with the women and celebrate International Women’s Day. “We will submit memoranda to the authorities again on Monday. We will wait a bit, but if no action is forthcoming to end the illegal supply of alcohol in the area, we will have to take recourse to other measures. We will see what has to be done,” Chopra said. 
 
 Sub-inspector Hanuman Sahay of the Sadar Police Station under whose jurisdiction this area falls, said, “We have ensured that the illegal sale of alcohol has been stopped. We even have a constable regularly posted in the area to prevent illegal sale. We have acted on complaints received, what can we do if the women continue to sit on dharna?”
