KOLKATA/HOOGHLY: Angry with the desecration of a Syama Prasad Mookerjee’s bust at   on Wednesday, Bengal BJP workers on Friday went on a “purification” spree of the leader’s statues across the state on Friday that led to clashes with rival political parties, which had also got involved in “statue politics”. 

 
 BJP supporters started their “suddhikaran” drive with a statue of Mookerjee near  , which was carried out unopposed. 
  
 
 But a showdown took place between the party workers and rival groups at Serampore’s RMS Maidan, where at least nine people were injured. 
  
 
 When BJP members reached the maidan with cans of milk and water, apparently to purify a Mookerjee’s statue there, they found Trinamool members already present with milk and water. 
  
 As the BJP group headed for the statue, Trinamool members allegedly blocked their way. 
  
 
 They apparently tried to drag the BJP members away that led to a clash in which several people were thrashed. The injured were admitted to   Walsh Hospital. The Trinamool, however, accused BJP of “making trouble”.
  
  
 State BJP workers claimed their members were also stopped from pouring milk and water on a bust in front of Mookerjee’s parental home at   in Jirat, Hooghly. 
 
 While a clash ensued between BJP and Trinamool supporters, one BJP worker apparently sneaked in and poured water over the bust. “We have performed ‘suddhikaran’ at at least 27 places. The attacks on BJP workers shows the Trinamool is scared of BJP’s advances into the state,” said BJP’s state president  . 
  
 
 Three members of Hindu Astitwa Raksha Committee-—Vivek Kant Singh, Jyoti Chatterjee and Jaydip Jaiswal-—were sent to three days’ police custody following a clash with SFI activists in front of JU on Thursday. 
  
 
  Also, seven members of Radical, who reportedly desecrated Mookerjee’s bust at Keoratala, were sent to judicial custody till March 13.
