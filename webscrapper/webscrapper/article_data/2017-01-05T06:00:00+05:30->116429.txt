Visakhaptnam: District   Praveen Kumar suspended   P Syam Prasad and   officer (VRA) B Appa Rao, who was in charge of land records in Visakha rural mandal, for their alleged involvement or negligence in tampering with the Adangal or land books. 

 He also recommended to the state government that rural mandal tehsildar Sankara Rao too be suspended for the same offence. 
 
 Elaborating on the land scam, the collector said two persons — Vommi Dalinayudu and Anil Kumar — had registered 36 acres of land worth Rs 100 crore abutting Gitam University in Rushikonda based on an endorsement from the tehsildar’s office. 
 
 The accused then created a fake ownership document and approached the high court and secured an order in their favour. Based on the High Court order, the sub-registrar registered the land to these people.
 
 After verifying the facts, the collector suspended the deputy tehsildar and VRA and also ordered a police investigation against the two people. The land registration has been cancelled and the property taken into the district administration’s possession. 
 
 The collector said Gitam University has been requesting the government for the land since 2006. The alienation of land proposals were pending with the government. The same land was registered by these people with fake documents. Such frauds were taking place at Ananadapuram, Pendurthi and Sabbavaram, Praveen Kumar said.
