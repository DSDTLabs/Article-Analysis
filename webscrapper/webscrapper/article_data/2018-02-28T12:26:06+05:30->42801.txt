PANAJI: The annual grant of Rs 3 lakh given to government-aided schools to operate   buses for students is expected to be hiked to Rs 5 lakh, according to official sources. The aid is used by schools for maintenance and fuel for the buses, besides payment of salaries of drivers and attendents of these buses. A year ago, drivers and attendants had gone on strike demanding a pay raise.

 In 2013, the government had modified the Bal Rath scheme and began providing schools with an annual grant instead of the earlier system of awarding monthly remunerations to meet the expenses of operating the bus. While schools in urban areas are given a grant of Rs 3.1 lakh annually, those in rural areas receive a grant of Rs 3.2 lakh. 
 
 After the scheme was modified, the schools had to bear the expenses of maintenance of the bus and fuel apart from the salary of the driver and attendant. The decision was taken as the state education department had been inundated with complaints of non-payment of salaries to bus staff, resulting in discontinuation of services which inconvenienced students.
 
 A proposal to hike payment of Bal Rath drivers and attendants has been under consideration for a while now. Members of the   had said there has been no pay revision since 2010, when the drivers and attendants were first hired. Drivers were hired on a salary of Rs 10,000 and attendants got Rs 5,000.
 
 The objective of the Balrath scheme is to provide transport facilities to children who have residences in areas that are remote from taluka places and district headquarters in the state.
