 In his petition, Malwinder informed the HC that in April, September and October 2016, municipal corporation of Patiala had ordered to fill up a considerable portion of the Rajindra Tank Lake with earth work up to the level of the road in the garb of developing a pathway. The corporation instead of restoring the lake is determined to cover a considerable area of the said water body on all four sides by filling the same with heavy earth work.
 
 It was also informed that the large area dedicated to the water body has been ordered to filed up by heavy earth work, stone boulders and   work. The execution of the said order will destroy the very existence of the sole water body namely Rajindra Tank Lake in Patiala.
 
 Malwinder had sought directions to initiate consolidated steps backed by proper scientific planning to restore the Rajindra Tank Lake by harvesting water from various sources such as pre-existing water drains and natural gradients to fill up the lake with water.
