CHANDIGARH: Patiala MP Dr Dharamvira Gandhi has described AAP leader H S Phoolka’s statement that Haryana and Delhi should be fed with water from the Sharda-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal of  , as a “clever move to cover his party for going back on its promise of protecting Punjab’s waters and please his Delhi masters”.

 Dr Gandhi, who AAP had suspended in August 2015 for “anti-party activities”, said AAP had forsaken Punjab’s rights in favor of Delhi and Haryana. “Whether there is enough water or not is totally out of context. The question is whether   enjoys unfettered riparian rights over its waters or not,” he said.
 
 Gandhi said Phoolka’s statements were “misleading”, “unacceptable”, and an attempt to derail the state’s waters issue in order to dilute it. “Neither Haryana nor Delhi or Rajasthan are riparian states. They are not even a part of the Sutlej basin,” he said.
 
 Challenging the constitutionality of sections 78, 79 and 80 of the Punjab Reorganization Act, Gandhi claimed that these sections were a poor alibi for “looting” Punjab waters for more than 50 years.
