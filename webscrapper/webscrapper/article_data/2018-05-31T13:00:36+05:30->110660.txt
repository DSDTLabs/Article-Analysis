HYDERABAD:   (TJS) founder-president M   will soon launch a bus yatra to expose the failures and unfulfilled promises of K Chandrasekhar Rao-led   government. 

 
 The bus yatra will cover all the 119 Assembly constituencies and will be timed keeping in view the ensuing Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. The TJS is the third party to have decided to take up a bus yatra in   against the ruling TRS, with   already having covered 50% of the constituencies. The BJP too, has announced a bus yatra which would commence soon.
 
 "Though there was tremendous pressure from the TJS party cadre and leaders that Kodandaram should take up a padayatra, party senior leaders later decided that a bus yatra was a better option to cover all the 119 constituencies before the bugle is sounded for the Assembly polls," a senior TJS leader said.
 
 The bus yatra is likely to start in June-end or July first week, to ensure all constituencies are covered even if the Lok Sabha elections are advanced to December this year. Kodandaram will lead the bus yatra with leaders accompanying him and aspirants from respective Assembly and Lok Sabha constituencies joining him.
 
 When contacted, Kodandaram confirmed to TOI that the party has in principle decided to take up a yatra to go to people. "All sections in the state feel the aspirations for which Telangana was achieved, by and large, remain unfulfilled even four years after the TRS came to power. The yatra will highlight TJS roadmap to fulfil the aspirations of people. We will listen to their grievances and try to address them," he said.
