VADODARA: Army premise is one place where the commoners are not allowed to enter. 
 
 But on Sunday, over 100 citizens got an opportunity to get a glimpse of greenery inside the Electronics and Mechanical Engineering (EME) premise in Fatehgunj. A group of nature lovers had organized nature walk inside the EME premises to explore not just different variety of plants and shrubs but several species of birds as well. 
 
 “We were in touch with the EME officials since we have been helping them deal with environmental conservation within their campus. When I told them about the NWG and its activities and requested them to allow a nature walk on a patch between Mangal Pandey Road EME Campus, they welcomed the move and granted us the permission,” said Dr  , an environmentalist said.
 
 “Now it has become rare to find such green patch in urban areas. We walked along the   bank and found a variety of trees and plants. The Army officials told us that we can do more such nature walks in their premise. In fact, they asked for suggestions to improve green cover there,” said Dr   who organizes the nature walk every Sunday. 
 
 Meanwhile, avid bird watcher Avi Sabawala said, “The fact that such a small patch of land has a large number of birds in it proves that if concretization of Vishwamitri River happens it would have irreversible impact on the biodiversity. While a lot of importance is now given by the government on nature conservation, the local authorities must take proper precautions when they design the riverfront project and ensure minimum human interference.”
 
 “EME would always support the initiatives which are aimed at conserving nature. With required norms to be followed this group would be able to visit some other spots as well,” an army official said.
