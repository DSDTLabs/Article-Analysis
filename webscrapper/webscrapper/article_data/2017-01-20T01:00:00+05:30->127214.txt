 Subhash Kapoor’s 'Jolly LLB 2' is a courtroom comedy and the songs in the album are equally quirky. First in line is 'Go Pagal'. Manj Musik ushers in Holi with this mad caper of a song. There’s nothing about bheegoing chunari and rangofying dupatta. It’s all maaroing goli and 'wearing paani ka goggle'! Raftaar and Nindy Kaur infuse energy in this already fast-paced song, and the EDM-ish music complements it. Our pick of the album is 'Bawara Mann'. A soft, slow, romantic number in the voice of Jubin Nautiyal and Neeti Mohan, it brings out the natural chemistry that   and   share in the film. Composer Chirrantan Bhatt’s keys and strings arrangement accentuate the song, which can make for a soothing listen after a tiring day at work.   have come up with a desi version of 'For He’s A Jolly Good Fellow', and we must say, it’s quite a mishmash of sensibilities, with hip hop-ish rap finding a place in the rendition as well. Apparently, Akshay was inspired after his daughter sang the rhyme, and he suggested the makers come up with 'Jolly Good Fellow' for the film as a promotional track. It describes the personality of the titular character and like his persona, the number is crazy as well. A shout out to Shabbir Ahmed, who has come up with lyrics like He’s A Jolly Good Fellow, He’s A Jolly Good Fellow, Jai Kanhaiya Lal Ki, Bolte Chalo! The last song in the album is the slow qawwali composed by Vishal Khurana, 'O Re Rangreza'. Sukhwinder Singh leads the show, with Murtuza Mustafa and Qadir Mustafa giving him ample support. There’s loads of emotion in this one, but somehow, it fails to gel with the rest. What works in the album’s favour is that the songs are short in duration, but make a powerful impact.
