Siblings that share a common vision and passion can together bring a dream to life. Their work makes for an inspiring and heart-warming story.   and Karnesh Sharma’s bond is one such tale. The brother-sister duo works towards making films that matter and that will remain etched in memory under their production banner that focusses on quality cinema. Their films are carefully budgeted and ride heavily on the content and the style of story-telling. Anushka and Karnesh’s second home production, ' ', is not an exception to that rule, although it’s a departure from the gritty 'NH 10'.

 The bhai-behen jodi tackled challenges including pests and animals like snakes on 'Phillauri's' real locations in the interiors of Punjab, harsh weather and unpredictable last-minute challenges while filming. Anushka had a tougher task on hand — juggling other projects while shooting her home production. Karnesh recalls, “Anushka had to multitask to stick to our schedule, which was tight, given that we were shooting away from Mumbai and on real locations. The summer wasn’t easy to handle either but she managed well.”
 
 With moments of celebration like birthdays, shoot wrap-up parties and impromptu get-togethers, the producer duo made sure team 'Phillauri' was always in the best of spirits. Anushka, on her part, adds, “I don’t think I could have pulled off 'Phillauri', or for that matter, all that we do at our production house without Karnesh. His dedication, sincerity and eye for detail have been a tremendous help. I trust him completely and am so happy that together, we make for a phenomenal team.”
