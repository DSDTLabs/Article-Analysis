HYDERABAD: Hoping to get more top performers in the   this year, the Hyderabad district authorities have begun distributing nutritious food to hundreds of students in  .

 “Most of the students come to school without breakfast and midday meal is their first food intake. Thus, students suffer from nutrition anaemia. If students get hungry, they cannot concentrate on studies and as a result they are securing poor results in SSC exam,” Hyderabad collector   told TOI.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 Authorities have decided to provide five varieties of snacks with high nutrition value, including chikki made with sesame, ragi biscuits, palli patti (jaggery coated peanuts/groundnuts), peanuts and masala green peas.
 
 Initially, the district administration had shortlisted over 2,000 SSC students in 182 government high schools as ‘slow learners’ based on their performance in class tests. The collector asked district educational officials to concentrate on these students to bring them at par with better performing students.
 
 “Initially we identified over 2,000 students who are slow learners, but to avoid discrimination we are  ,000 SSC students,” Yogitha Rana said. She also asked headmasters to run special classes for one hour during morning and after class hours for the slow learners.
 
 “The responsibility of preparation of these snacks has been allotted to a firm which prepares midday meal for government school students. We are spending Rs 28 lakh to provide snacks for 75 days. We have allocation of Rs 5.5 crore for each district collector under ‘Crucial Balancing Fund’ (CBF) by the PMO to spend for education and health of the students,” the collector said.
