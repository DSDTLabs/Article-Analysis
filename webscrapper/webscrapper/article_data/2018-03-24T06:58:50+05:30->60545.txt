CHANDIGARH: As   (GMADA) remained ineffective in enforcing its construction policies, five private educational institutions raised their buildings illegally on 62 acres as they didn’t obtain change of land use (CLU) certificates for the same.

 These irregularities were highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) in its report tabled in the   assembly on Thursday. The defaulting institutes were  , Chandigarh University, Chandigarh Group of Colleges, Dashmesh Khalsa College and  .
 
 
 “This not only resulted in loss of revenue on account of CLU charges to the government, but also endangered safety of students studying in these institutes as building bylaws were not adhered to during the construction of these buildings,” read the audit report.
 
 GMADA attributed the reason for these lapses to shortage of staff and said these institutes had to pay very heavy penalty under the compounding policy. “But no documentary evidence regarding levy and recovery of penalty was produced to the audit,” says the CAG report.
 
 These five institutes had applied for regularisation of unauthorised buildings constructed on their campuses.
 
 These institutions constructed buildings on 138.64 acres in violation of building rules without obtaining CLU of 62.23 acres. Three institutes namely Chandigarh Group of Colleges, Chandigarh University and Rayat Bahra Group of Institutes obtained CLU of 76.41 acre, whereas two institutes did not.
