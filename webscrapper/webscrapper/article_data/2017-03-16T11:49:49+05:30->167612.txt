YAVATMAL: It was the darkest day for the non descript village Chilgawhan of Mahagaon tehsil of Yavatmal district where on March 19, 1986, a debt ridden and nature beaten farmer had taken his young wife and four minor children to village Dattapur of Pavanar in   where he had bought a packet of rat killer   and mixed it with the food they cooked in the night and served it to his family members and he too ate it. The next morning the news of the mass suicide of the farmer and his five family members had rocked not only the district but also the entire State.

 Farmers across the State will come together to hold a one day fast to be launched from Mahagaon to commemorate the 31st anniversary for the tragic end of a farmer and his five member family in the district’s Chilgawhan village of Mahagaon tehsil. 
 
 The fast is led by the Shetkari Sanghatana activists and the originator of ‘Kisanputra Andolan’ Amar Habib of Ambejogai.
 
 Others who extended their wholehearted support and also to join the fast include the Sahitya Academy Award winner Aasaram Lomte, renowned Marathi poet and singer Guru Thakur, Principal Sureshchandra Mehtre of village Ambethana of Pune who is one of the close associates of Shetkari Sanghatana supremo Late Sharad Joshi, Abhijit Falke (Pune), Santosh Arsod, Dr. Mithun Alate and   (all from Ner) and a host of others across the region will also join the protest. 
 
 The families of the entire village Satefal in the district have resolved to draw black rangoli at their household to express their solidarity with the fasting farmers on March 19.
 
 Amar Habib has, in a press release, urged the farmers across the State to join the fast and observe it from wherever they are on March 19.
 
 ‘The main cause of the spate in farmers’ suicide is the anti farmer policy adopted by the Govts in succession and it would continue if the Govt fails to change its agriculture policy to sustain the nation’s grains and other food cultivating farmers,’ Amar Habib said.
