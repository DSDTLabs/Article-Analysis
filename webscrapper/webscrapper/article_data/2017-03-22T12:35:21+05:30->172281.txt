After being in the news for the casting coup of the year, 
  and 
  starrer ‘Veere Di Wedding’ has only been subjected to delays. Earlier, the shoot was supposed to start in mid-2016, but got pushed ahead owing to Kareena’s pregnancy.
 
  
  
 This time around, the film is embroiled in a fresh controversy. Turns out, one of Jimmy Sheirgill’s 
  is titled ‘Veerey Ki Wedding’. The striking similarity in the films’ titles is causing much agony for ‘Veere Di Wedding’ producer and Sonam’s father  . According to reports, Anil has written a letter to Indian Motion Pictures Producers’ Association (IMPPA) and has asked for their intervention.
  
 While the Kapoors claim to have registered the title first, ‘Veerey Ki Wedding’ director Ashu Trikha insisted that they had acquired a copyright and trademark for the film title. He also added that they registered the title with the valid association, Indian Film and TV Producers Council.
 
 The director also insisted that according to the rules of the association, a trademark supersedes any other registration. The major part of the film has been shot and 80 percent of the film will be completed by next week.
  
 ‘Veerey Ki Wedding’ co-producer mentioned that IMPPA has granted them a go-ahead after learning about the trademark and the completion of a major chunk of the film. According to reports, Anil might have to opt for a new title as the shoot of ‘Veere Di Wedding’ is yet to begin.
