PATNA:   president   on Monday said PM   would never become like Mahatma Gandhi.

 Addressing a function at the state Congress HQ here, Lalu assailed Modi for using his picture in the Khadi and   diary and calendar. “Saat janam mein bhi Gandhi ke barabar nahi ho paoge (You will never become like Gandhi even after taking seven births),” he said.
 
 Lalu said Modi and his workers once used to shout ‘Bapu hum sharminda hai, tere qatil zinda hai’. “They are now trying to kill even Gandhian thoughts. They have launched a concerted campaign against Gandhi’s ideology of non-violence and secularism,” the RJD chief said.
 
 Recalling Haryana minister Anil Vij’s claim that Modi is a better brand name than Gandhi, Lalu said the nation is ashamed at the   minister’s utterances. 
 
 Assailing Modi on the issue of note ban, Lalu asked Modi who took the notebandi decision. “Your finance minister told Parliament the decision was taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). But the RBI has washed its hands of it, saying the decision was taken at the government level,” Lalu said.
 
 Welcoming Lalu at the Congress office, BPCC chief and education minister Ashok Choudhary described him as the greatest secular leader.
