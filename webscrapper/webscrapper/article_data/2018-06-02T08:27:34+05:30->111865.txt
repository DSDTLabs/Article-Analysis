 Haresh Acharya, secretary of the National Bullion Federation, said, “The first part of April saw good sales due to the ongoing Chaitra month of the Hindu calendar. The remaining purchases may have been made during Akshaya Tritiya, which fell in the middle of April. Jewellers and bullion traders thus, could have ended up stocking up gold in May, due to which imports have gone up.”
 
 The price of gold was Rs 31,870 per 10g on Friday. Analysts feel that with prices are on the higher side, some investors may also have invested in the yellow metal, in hope of better returns.

 Imports, however, declined by 47% in May 2018 in comparison with May 2017, when 13MT of gold was imported.
 
 Analysts say that this is primarily because Akshaya Tritiya fell in May last year, due to which a lot of gold was bought due to the auspicious muhurat.
