 • It would’ve been much better if we had scored more numbers. Still, there’s satisfaction we were able to stop communal forces. That it was done with the help of a regional party like ours is the icing on the cake.
 
 
 
 
 • We honestly never expected majority. It’s true I had said we’d prefer to sit in the opposition if we don’t get to form government. However, the context was different. Today, the situation demanded that secular parties came together. I’m happy Congress came forward with unconditional support.
 
 
 
 
 • While the earlier BJP coalition tainted my son, he has now managed to cleanse himself. He was also aware how hurt I was and was very conscious this time to not repeat the mistake.
 
 
 
 
 • This arises from experiences of 2004-2006, when the two parties did not complete full term, but both Congress and we have learnt from that experience. I’m confident the present arrangement will govern for five full years.
 
 
 
 
 • Next destination is 2019. The need of the hour is for secular parties to come together.   has not just shown the way but has gone a step ahead by forming government. This should inspire regional parties to come together and put up a concerted fight against BJP.
 
 
 
 
 • BJP’s methods were not just wrong, but in sharp contradiction to the party’s stand and claims in other states like Goa where it said that emerging as single-largest party is not enough to form government. BJP had then said if the combined strength of parties was more than that of the single largest, the combination must be allowed to form government, which they did in Goa.
 
 
 
 
 • Ghulam Nabi Azad arrived in Bengaluru a day before May 15. They were in touch with me for a few days and their quick response on May 15, stemming from backroom discussions with the JD(S), effectively managed to stump BJP’s immediate plans.
 
 
 
 
 • BJP should learn its lesson — it cannot form governments by horsetrading. They claim to be a party of difference, but this should not be how they behave.
