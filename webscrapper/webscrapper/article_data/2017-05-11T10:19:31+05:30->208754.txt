GUWAHATI: The   in the heart of the city has been  , according to an   scholar. 

 Eutrophication, pollution that manifests through mass production of harmful algae and undesirable biotic changes, has engulfed the surface layer of the historical water body, which is now off-limits for swimming but still remains a popular spot.
 
 Jayatu Kanta Bhuyan, a Master's degree-holder in the field of environmental and resource management from  , Germany, is researching restoration and management techniques for maintaining clean water bodies. Bhuyan recently made this observation. The expert also said the technology to clean water bodies by employing artificial destratification system or air bubble diffuser is not available in the state.
 
 Bhuyan then shared this observation with Eiichi Furusato, a Japanese professor from University of Saitama, Japan who said the water in Dighalipukhuri was not suitable for public health, let alone recreational activities. "This technology has been in operational since the 1950s. In India, states like Gujarat, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand and others have already implement this technology. This was also used in Lake Nainital. In  , this technology hasn't been used," said Bhuyan.
 
 Eutrophication is mostly the result of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous polluting such bodies. Experts said eutrophication can occur naturally over centuries with the aging of water bodies but, of late, the rate has accelerated because of human activities.
