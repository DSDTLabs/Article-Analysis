AHMEDABAD: Art critic, author and artist,  , recounted her journey and work in Jewish literature, while speaking about ‘My Novels: Finding a Homeland’ on Saturday. The talk was organized by the faculty of design (foundation year),  , as part of a lecture series.

 Esther referred to the festival of Passover – commemorating when the Jewish patriarch   led the Jews to freedom from slavery in Egypt and how the Ten Commandments were in search of their homeland and said, “The concept of the wandering Jew is connected to Jews and was like a thin streak within me. It was a feeling I never understood for a long time, till I was almost in my mid-forties and became conscious of my Jewish traditions.”
 
 “Eventually, as I studied art, the conflict of being a Jew in India and being torn between two ways of life, made me seek answers. The fact that there was hardly any literature written by Indian Jews about Jews in India was one trigger,” said Esther.
 
 “Another came when I was approached by publishers to write about five generations of Jews in India and it is then that I actually took to researching and writing. That’s how my books – The Book of   and The Book of Rachel – came up. It started with the conflict and now I find my homeland, my solace in my books,” she added.
