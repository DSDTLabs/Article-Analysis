LUDHIANA: A day after TOI highlighted traffic chaos outside some schools, especially during the closing hours, the traffic police deputed a constable outside one such school on Pakhowal road where the menace had turned into headache for commuters. 

 Commuters who travelled on that stretch were happy with the development.
 
 “Traffic outside schools was one of the major problems. We had to wait in long queues. I’m was glad to see a constable managing traffic at Pakhowal chowk on Thursday. I hope it continues from now onwards,” says  , a commuter.
 
 “Finally, we saw a well-managed traffic on Thursday. Traffic outside the convent school had become a serious problem. Parents coming to pick up their wards used to park their vehicles on roadsides. As this problem is not limited to just one school, I hope similar action will be taken to control traffic outside other schools too,” said  , a commuter.
 
 “This has always been a big problem. I felt happy to see the constable controlling the traffic at the spot. At least we won’t have to fight with people for smooth traffic from now onwards. We will look forward to get more such solutions to other problems,” said  , a resident.
 
 “I saw smooth traffic movement after so many months. I hope this will be a permanent thing,” said  , a resident.
