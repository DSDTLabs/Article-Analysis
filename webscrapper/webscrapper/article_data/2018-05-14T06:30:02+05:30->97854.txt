KOLKATA: A man in his 30s was killed by his friend after an altercation between them while the duo was drinking by the railway tracks near   in Tangra on Sunday morning. 

 Cops said the two fought after the victim, Istikar Hossain (34), demanded the money, which the accused, Avishek Hari, owed him. As the two quarrelled, Hari took out a knife and stabbed Hossain. 
 
 Hearing him scream, locals rushed to the spot and caught Hari, who was trying to flee. 
 
 Locals later spotted the body and identified him as a local youth and took him to   and Hospital after informing the cops. Hossain was later declared dead at the hospital.
 
 Hossain's brother Iftikar lodged a complaint based on which the accused was arrested. 
 
 The incident took place less than 48 hours after a   loyalist and a local promoter, Babu Sarkar (53), was killed in broad daylight on Friday. Sarkar was hacked to death in front of a policeman at a kiosk at the entry of China Town. Sarkar was attacked multiple times for about three minutes and left to die on the road. The murder was an apparent fallout of a pitched battle between two alleged rival factions of the party in the neighbourhood. 
 
 Probing into the case, cops arrested another Trinamool Congress worker, Jaydev Halder, from Chinapatty area in Tangra on Saturday night.
