GUWAHATI: A team of heart specialists and surgeons at Narayana Health (formerly  ) in Bengaluru is examining a four-day-old baby girl from   who was born with Ectopia cordis, a condition in which the heart is located outside the thoracic cavity. 

 The   is a rare abnormality with an estimated prevalence of 5.5 to 7.9 per million live births and chances of survival are slim. The Bengaluru team will operate upon the baby to put her heart back into the thoracic cavity.
 
 "Some of the best specialists and surgeons are currently evaluating the case. The team is doing its best to save the baby," an official of the   (GMCH), who accompanied the baby and her mother to Bengaluru, said.
 
 The baby was born to 28-year-old Tazmina Khatun at a dispensary in Dhubri on Wednesday. After the defect was noticed, the infant was brought to the GMCH but doctors here decided not to operate upon her due to her condition.
 
 The state government on Friday flew out the baby and her mother to the Karnataka capital under an ongoing scheme in which children suffering from congenital heart defects and hailing from poor families are given free treatment in hospitals in Bengaluru and Kolkata.
