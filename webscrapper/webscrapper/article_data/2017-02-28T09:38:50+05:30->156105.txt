HYDERABAD: School students will have to brave sweltering heat during their final examinations, scheduled to be held from early March, as day temperature is all set to touch 38-40 degree Celsius.

 The unprecedented summer heat in the state is disturbing children's study schedule, especially for those in primary and upper primary classes. In the last few days, the   (IMD) reported that Hyderabad recorded a temperature of 37 degree Celsius whereas places such as Mahbubnagar touched 40.5 degree Celsius.
 
 While schools affiliated to the   (CBSE) will close for abrief period by March end and commence the next academic year by April second week, state board schools too are expected to follow suit. “Rising temperature definitely stands as a major concern for us. But since it is examination period, we cannot even postpone the schedule. We are hopeful that considering the weather conditions, the school education department will eventually take a call on the school hours,“ said Srinivas Reddy , president of Telangana State Recognised  .
 
 Long study hours and addi tional recess time in schools in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh already leave students fatigued by the end of the day . As per National Council of Educational Training and Research report that mapped out school patterns, students in the two Telugu states spent more time at school as they put in between five-and-a-half and six-and-a-half hours of study time and three recesses totalling 80 minutes.
 
 Parents fear that rising temperature may lead to health issues among many students.“My daughter returns from school by 3.30pm when the sun is at its peak. The heat leaves her exhausted and dehydrated to such an extent that she has no energy left to even complete her homework,“ said Pranathi Deva, a homemaker.
