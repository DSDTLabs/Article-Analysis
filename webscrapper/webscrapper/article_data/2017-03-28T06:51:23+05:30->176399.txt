THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief minister   has announced a judicial inquiry into the sex scandal that forced NCP leader   to quit the cabinet.

 “Saseendran expressed willingness to step down as minister, immediately after the scandal broke out. But, that doesn't mean that he stepped down by accepting all allegations against him.While putting in his papers, he has asked for a detailed probe into the whole episode. He decided to step down by upholding his moral values,“ Vijayan said here on Monday . Police earlier ruled out a probe into the episode unless the woman involved in the scandal or the for mer minister lodged a complaint. Vijayan said the cabinet meeting on Wednesday would finalise the terms and reference and other details of the judicial investigation. The probe is likely to be conducted by a retired high court judge.
 
 “Our experience is that we don't get a serving judge even after wasting too much time waiting for it,“ he said. The chief minister said people facing such allegations normally waited till a preliminary inquiry was conducted to relinquish their posts. “Such tendencies could become an encouragement to detractors. But Saseendran stuck to his position that he did not wish to continue in the cabinet and wanted the government to order an appropriate probe into the allegations. The public too seem to have supported his stand,“ he said.
 
 Vijayan said the allegations of tapping telephones of persons in high positions, including himself, would be probed if needed.
