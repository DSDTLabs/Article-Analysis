CHANDIGARH: Punjab Congress president Captain   flayed Union finance minister   on Monday, saying that the BJP leader was trying to protect chief minister   and his kin in the multi-crore synthetic drugs racket by ensuring a clean chit of the   for the key accused. Amarinder promised an independent investigation into the case after coming to power.

 “The ED, which works directly under the Union finance ministry, has allowed Jagdish Singh Bhola, Bittu Aulakh and Sukjinder Singh Sukha to go scot-free at the behest of Jaitley,” Amarinder said at a rally here on Monday, alleging a massive cover-up by Jaitley to save the skins of the Badals and their kin, revenue minister Bikram Singh Majithia.
 
 “Even as he has launched a witch-hunt against me and my family, Jaitley is leaving no stone unturned to protect Akali leaders,” said Amarinder, adding that Jaitley’s   (BJP), an ally of the Akalis in Punjab, was trying to help the Badals and Majithia wriggle out of the “grave charges of running a drug mafia” with an eye on the Assembly polls.
 
 Pointing out that it was these three accused who had implicated Majithia in the drugs racket, Captain Amarinder said by letting them off the hook, the ED had effectively cleared Majithia’s name.
 
 “Jaitley’s hand can clearly be seen in the whole business,” said the PPCC president, adding that once elected to power, his government would reopen the entire case and get it investigated afresh by an independent agency.
