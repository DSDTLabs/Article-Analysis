BENGALURU: From solutions for issues plaguing the city to major challenges that need to be the government’s priorities,   (CWAs) from all eight zones of Bengaluru created a charter compiled through a   and debates with officials. It was submitted to   on Tuesday.

 The charter is the result of  ,   which created an inclusive and constructive citywide civic campaign bringing together the government of Karnataka, civic agencies and Bengaluru’s citizens.
 
 The idea emerged after a brainstorming session at TOI in October 2017 and the plan to draft a citizens’ charter was put into action through five zonal Bengaluru Forward events, which were a learning exercise for all stakeholders.
 
 The five events were through December 2017 and January 2018, with the focus on six core sectors. Based on feedback from these workshops, further consultations were held before finalising the charter.
 
 The first Bengaluru Forward event was on December 9, 2017 and the last on January 20, 2018. There were five zonal charters, one each for five zones — East, West, South, Mahadevpura, Bommanahalli and Yelahanka as well as RR Nagar and Dasarahalli. 
 
 The campaign gave citizens a chance to interact with key decision-makers of the city, including the mayor, Bengaluru development minister and a host of officials from BBMP and BWSSB, the two key civic agencies.
 
 A common refrain at these meetings was that a responsive administration would take the first step in listening to them. Through this charter, they hope the process of governance which takes citizens seriously gets kick-started.
