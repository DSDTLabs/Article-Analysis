HYDERABAD: The Telangana chief minister   has given his nod for trimming down the list of over   for the   in Greater Hyderabad constructed under JNNURM,  , Vambay and other schemes. 

 Such a move is expected to save the state government at least 1,500 crore. But on the flip side, the   has to first spend 338 crore to repair, renovate and complete construction of the incomplete housing units. GHMC has already spent 1000 crore to complete construction of nearly 40,000 housing units. There are about 25,000 housing units lying incomplete in various housing colonies built by the government. 
 
 These flats are vacant as the beneficiaries did not pay their part of the contribution. Also, contractors could not complete flooring or laying of tiles or plumbing or electricity works in a large number of such flats. Many of these units do not even have doors and window fittings or if present, are in a damaged condition.
 
 Now, the civic body has decided to carry out repairs, renovate and allot them to the beneficiaries. By cross checking with Aadhaar, voter ID, ration cards and bank pass books, beneficiaries would be deleted from the list of double-bed room applicants if they are already beneficiaries of other schemes.
 
 Officials said “If the JNNURM flat was allotted in the name of the father, then it is the mother or grown up children who are applying for the double bedroom unit.”
 
 When contacted, GHMC Commissioner B Janardhan Reddy confirmed to TOI that the body is taking a loan of 338 crore from HUDCO to repair the JNNURM and housing scheme units lying vacant following which it will allot them to the rightful beneficiaries.
