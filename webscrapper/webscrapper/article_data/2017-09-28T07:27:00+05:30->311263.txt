Garhshankar: Bodies of a 32-year-old widow woman and her 12-year-old son were found in a wheat chaff storing room of a closed down cattle feed factory in Rasoolpur village near Garhshankar on Wednesday. The matter came to light when woman’s paramour Sandeep alias Deepa called up the factory owner to say that he was leaving the room in which he was living with the deceased woman.

 Factor owner Renu Chaudhary, a resident of Tonsa, said the factory had shut down and sometime ago their former worker Sandeep requested her to give him a room on the factory premises where he would live with Jaspal Kaur. He also told the factory owner that he had married Jaspal.
 
 On Wednesday, Sandeep called Renu up and said he was leaving the room as he had found a new place. However, the factory owner got suspicious and after reaching the room, she found Sandeep cleaning his room. She also spotted some blood stains on the floor. 
 
 Police officials said when Renu questioned Sandeep, he reportedly fled from the spot. Later, she found that Jaspal and her son Dilpreet Singh were lying dead in a chaff storing room with sharp-edged injuries. After discovering the bodies, Renu immediately called up the police. 
 
 During investigation, police learnt that the in-laws of the deceased resided in Sujjon village and had lodged a missing report with Nawanshahr police on September 25. They had told the cops that Jaspal’s husband had died in February last and she had gone missing with her two sons on September 12. Her elder son Jaskaran Singh, 14, is still missing. Police has launched a manhunt to arrest the accused.
