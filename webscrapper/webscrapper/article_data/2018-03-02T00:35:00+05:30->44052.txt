Coimbatore: A staggering 5,200 runaway children had been rescued at railway stations across the state over the past three years, said the superintendent of police, government railway police (GRP), Georgy George, here on Thursday. In the past two months, as many as 166 children, including 12 girls, were rescued at Tamil Nadu railway stations.

 At least 2,068 runaway children were rescued in 2017 alone, out of which 226 were girls, the officer said.
 
 Georgy George was in the city to inaugurate the NGO Udhayam, an initiative of the GRP to rescue runaway children and prevent child trafficking in railway stations and trains across the state, in Coimbatore Railway Junction. He said porters, auto drivers, call taxi drivers and vendors would be its members and they would be given volunteer cards. As many as 261 such people were given volunteer cards at the city railway junction.
 
 The GRP had launched Udhayam in Chennai Central and Salem Railway Junction in the past two days. “We will cover all the railway stations across the state and it will help us to rescue the runaway children found at the railway stations, which are the crucial points. The volunteers will work round-the-clock inside and outside the railway stations. We have asked them to inform the police if they were to find children roaming in the railway station premises,” Goergy George said.
 
 Pointing out that it was highly impossible for the railway police to monitor the children round the clock, he said the volunteers would help them rescue the runaway children and prevent child trafficking.
 
 The GRP, he said, had rescued 1,458 children, including 207 girls, in 2015 and 2,370 children, of them 272 girls, in 2016.
