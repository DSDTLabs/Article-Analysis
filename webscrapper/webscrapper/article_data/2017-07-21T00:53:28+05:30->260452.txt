Porvorim: Apparently angry over the inaction against the stray cattle menace in the state, former chief minister and senior Congress leader Pratapsingh Rane on Thursday advised BJP MLAs take home 15 stray   each and rear them. 

 Saying that there was so much noise being made about protecting the cow, Rane said cattle were being left stray by their owners. On the beef ban, Rane said, “Tomorrow, you will ask the people not to eat chicken, mutton.”
