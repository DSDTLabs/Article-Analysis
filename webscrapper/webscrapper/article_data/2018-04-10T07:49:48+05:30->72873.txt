POINGUINIM: Several   residents have complained that the regional transport office (RTO), Canacona, has been harassing them after issuing challans for violation of road rules by making them visit the office more than once for paying fines, stating that they do not have sufficient clerical staff as the officials are busy with the passing of vehicles during mornings.

 Due to this, residents have to make frequent trips to the office not only to pay fines, but to collect their licences as well. 
 
 Speaking to reporters,   said that he, too, received a few complaints of harassment by the department concerned, which he plans to discuss in the coming assembly session. When TOI contacted   (traffic)  , he said that what they follow is the implementation of rules enshrined in the Motor Vehicles Act and nothing beyond that.
 
 Local residents further alleged that the attitude of the government officials at the RTO was callous and not people-friendly.
 
 “If there is a shortage of clerical staff, then it is the duty of the department to look into it and not put the citizens to hardship,” said a local resident.
 
 When TOI contacted the assistant director of transport at Canacona, K Lotlikar, he denied the allegations and said that even though the office faces a staff shortage, he ensures that the work is completed.
