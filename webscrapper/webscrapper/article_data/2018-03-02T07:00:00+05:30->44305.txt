Ludhiana: Three students of MA (Punjabi) of a government college, here, were suspended for misbehaving with two women classmates and trying to physically   them on the campus on Wednesday.

 The women, who are siblings, gave a written complaint to the college authorities, saying the trio was blackmailing them to make their WhatsApp chat public. The authorities suspended the three students, including a woman, with immediate effect and set up a three-member committee to investigate the matter.
 
 In their complaint to the college principal, the students said all five of them were classmates and the trio had been harassing them for the past few days. They also abused them and on Wednesday tried to physically assault them on the campus.
 
 Sources in the college administration said all five were good friends and parted ways after some differences. One of the accused men has also got their WhatsApp conversation printed and bound in a spiral copy (of about 50 pages) and was threatening the sisters to make it public. The college authorities have got a copy of the chat.
 
 On Wednesday when they tried to physically assault the sisters, they raised the alarm and the staff reached the spot.
 
 The college principal said, “Two sisters of MA (Punjabi) have accused three classmates, including a woman, of mentally harassing them and trying to physically assault them on the campus. The girls have accused the men of blackmailing them. The three have been suspended and a panel formed to probe the matter and submit a report.”
