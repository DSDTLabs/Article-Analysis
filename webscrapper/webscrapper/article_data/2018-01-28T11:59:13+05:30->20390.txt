The charges of providing water with VMC’s tankers have also been hiked.
 
 The hikes have not gone unnoticed to the opposition in the civic body. VMC opposition leader   said that these hikes were hidden taxes. He added that Rs 25 to 30 crore would be mopped up by the civic body through these hikes.
