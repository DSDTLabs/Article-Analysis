Nagpur: A woman, in her late twenties, dramatically took a plunge into Futala lake on Friday after praying for a brief moment standing on the parapet even before the onlookers could react to pull her to safety. 

 The body of the woman, still unidentified, was later fished out of the lake by the fire brigade team. 
 
 Police said the woman, wearing black colour trousers and a yellow top, had a religious symbol on forehead which could mean that she could be a member of a tribal community. Local divers, who were in the vicinity, too had tried to rescue her as the onlookers raised an alarm. 
 
 The cops from the Ambazari police station were alerted by the control room after some citizens dialled ‘100’. 
 
 Fire brigade was summoned to the spot by Ambazari police as the local divers were not able to find the body which had got stuck at the bottom. 
 
 The fire brigade team had to lower a device to bring up the body which was then sent for post-mortem at Government medical college and hospital. 
 
 A case of accidental death has been registered at Ambazari police station. Sub-inspector VB Nayane of Ambazari police station said the efforts are being taken to establish the identification of the body. 
 
 “Only a scarf was found from the place where he had taken the plunge,” said PSI Nayane. “We have already started our regular measures to establish her identity,” he added.
