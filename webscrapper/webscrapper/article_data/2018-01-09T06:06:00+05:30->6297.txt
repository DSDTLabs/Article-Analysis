Nagpur: After a long wait, the commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) has finally agreed to inspect Nagpur Metro and clear the commercial operation of at-grade section.

 Mahametro had conducted trial run of the Metro on September 30 last year. Since then, it has been battling red tape of Research Design and Standard Organization (RDSO), Railway Board and CMRS.
 
 A source in Mahametro said the CMRS office has intimated that the commissioner would visit Nagpur between January 15 and 20. “He will combine the inspection of Nagpur-Sewagram railway track with that of Metro,” he added.
 
 Mahametro had scheduled commercial operation of at-grade section in December last year. However, due to delay on part of RDSO and CMRS, it is not expected to open for public in February this year.
 
 RDSO is a Ministry of Railways organization that tests technical aspects of new railway projects. Mahametro had conducted self trial of at-grade section and sent the results to the Lucknow-based organization, which issued a speed certificate on December 4, 2017.
 
 The conclusion was reached on the basis of oscillations recorded by oscillation measurement system (OMS) fitted on a Metro Rail coach during trial run. If the oscillations are within limit, then the track is fit for operation.
 
 CMRS may ask Mahametro to conduct speed test again. He will also inspect the stations, telecommunications and signalling equipment, training level of Metro staff, electrical traction system, in fact every aspect of the at-grade section.
 
 Mahametro had earlier got seven mandatory clearances from RDSO and Railway Board. It got five of them in August while the ones pertaining to track and electrical traction were obtained in September. Nagpur Metro got these clearances in record time.
