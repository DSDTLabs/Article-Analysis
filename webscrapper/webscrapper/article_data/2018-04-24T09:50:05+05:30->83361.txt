MYSURU: There is no escaping man-animal conflict in Malnad area. Plagued by increasing incidents of leopard attacks, residents of HD Kote have, in fact, made it a poll issue.

 Hundreds of officers and police personnel deputed for election duty deep in the forests of Mysuru and other Malnad districts get through each day under the shadow of animal attacks. The rain has only added to their misery.
 
 
 In Anechoukar, an election checkpost has been set up at the Mysuru-Kodagu border. The checkpost is around 2 km from the Titimathi elephant camp. Not a day has gone by that the staff on duty at this checkpost have not been visited by elephants during the day and at night.
 
 Two days ago, a local resident said a   destroyed the toilet built for the  . This toilet was located just a few meters from the checkpost.
 
 The checkpost staff light a fire to keep the animals away. “They keep the fire burning through the night,” said a villager.
 
 “Most of us are not trained in handling attacks by wild animals. In many places snakes are the big problem as they are attracted by lights,” said a duty staff who was reluctant to be identified. “Wild boars and leopards are frequent visitors at checkposts,” he added.
 
 But the problems is not just wild animals. Rain has also been playing havoc. The checkposts have collapsed in the rain. When contacted SP Amit Singh stated that he is not aware of the threat from wild animals. He said waterproof tents will be built at the earliest.
 
 “In many areas, checkposts are in animal corridors. They should have borne this in mind,” said a forest officer
