Guntur: In a novel protest against the Centre for refusing special category status (SCS) to the state, a confederation of NGOs has decided to dispatch soil and water from Amaravati to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other Union ministers. 

 The South Indian Non-Governmental Charitable Trust (SINGCT) wants to remind the PM that he has “washed his hands off” the promises he made when be brought the soil from Parliament and water from Yamuna to lay the foundation stone of Amaravati. The trust will also hold mass protests in Guntur and Velagapudi on Wednesday. 
 
 The SINGCT is a confederation of all non-governmental organisations in southern states. The trust had planned protest rallies at three places, including one on Prakasam Barrage, but had to cancel them following police objection.
 
 Speaking to the media, on Tuesday, president of the trust Yamini Sadineni said, “We want to show the courage and self-respect of the Telugu people by sending soil and water from the capital city area to the PM for deceiving five crore people.”
