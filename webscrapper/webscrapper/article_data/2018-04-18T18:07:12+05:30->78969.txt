JAIPUR: After   smashed the highest individual score of this season’s   - 92 off just 45 balls, which included an astounding 10 sixes - against Royal Challengers Bangalore, all eyes will naturally be on the talented youngster as   face   on Wednesday. At the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Royals skipper Ajinkya Rahane and Co. will leave no stone unturned to consolidate their position on the points table.

 
 
 
 Wednesday’s match will be a crucial test for the Knights, under captain Dinesh Karthik, as they seek consistency after winning two games out of four. They started off by beating RCB but lost a couple of matches against Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad before a thumping win over the Delhi Daredevils in their last outing. Royals have won two of their three games - against Daredevils and Bangalore - after being dominated by Hyderabad in their opening tie.
 
 
 
 Hosts Royals will look to make good use of the home conditions, where they have a 75 percent win record. Knights would do well to again bank on some lofty hitting by Andre Russell - who hit a 12-ball-41 against Delhi - if they are to breach the Royals’ fortress.
 
  
  
 
 For the Royals, Rahane and Samson would like to continue their winning streak. Jos Buttler and Rahul Tripathi will want to provide entertainment in the death overs, as they did against Delhi. Big Bash star D’Arcy Short will also look to get going, especially after getting only 10 runs in two games. The Royals’ bowling attack, comprising pacers Ben Laughlin and Dhawal Kulkarni, have done reasonably well to keep rival batsmen in check with their variations.
 
 
 
 
 On the other hand, Knights will also look to continue from where they had left off against Delhi. Here, captain Karthik’s role becomes key because he has the ability to adapt to the situation the game demands.
