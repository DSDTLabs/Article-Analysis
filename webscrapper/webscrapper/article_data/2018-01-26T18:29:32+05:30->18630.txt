LONDON: A report which suggests Kolkata could replace Bengalaru and become India's hub for start-ups was launched at an event here on Wednesday.

 'Kolkata 4.0: Developing an innovation ecosystem' outlines how India's cultural capital could now become India's digital powerhouse.
 
 Not-for-profit initiative Kolkata 4.0 Foundation (K4.0), the   (ICC) and UK industry body tech UK launched the report, while K4.0 and the ICC also signed an MoU at the event.
 
 "We normally associate words like innovation ecosystem with Bengaluru and Hyderabad," said Pratik Dattani, MD of EPG, who authored the report. But he said the world was looking east and Bengal was perfectly located to benefit.
 
 "Agricultural productivity in Bengal is double the rest of India. Manufacturing productivity is 50% higher. The last few years have seen a rapid pace of reforms in the state, better tax collections, reduction of deficits in debts, and these all offer opportunities."
 
 But there is a challenge of perception, he said. "The intention of the report is to change some of those perceptions."
 
 "The idea of Kolkata 4.0 is to link up the startups with the diaspora because many of them would like to access to their own network in terms of knowledge, technologies and markets," explained Dr  , director-general, ICC.
 
 "The UK and US chapters are already set up. When you speak of Bengal, people think of labour unrest with bandhs, but in the last five ears the number of days lost to these activities is the least of all the states," he added.
 
 He said Debashish Sen, additional chief secretary, IT & electronic, had phoned him as soon as TOI carried a preview of the report. "He said 'we would like to be part of it'," Singh said.
