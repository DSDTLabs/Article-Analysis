Ludhiana: A day after carrying out a search at three premises of the city’s leading sweet house, Sharman Jain Sweets, the state taxation department on Thursday conducted an inspection at another branch of the group located at Baghapurana in connection with Wednesday’s raids. According to highly placed sources in the department, the owners were using the same GST number for the showroom located at Baghapurana and those in Ludhiana. The inspection was held under the supervision of an assistant excise and taxation commissioner level official.

 Sources also informed that so far in the investigation of the department a lot of discrepancies were discovered in the tax returns filed by the company, and the tax collected from customers. However, officials are tight-lipped over the case. Speaking to TOI, a high-ranking official of the department, said: “As of now, it is not possible to disclose the exact amount of tax evaded by the firm. Our investigation is going on, and with new evidences emerging after inspection of the Baghapurana unit of the company, it will take us at least 2-3 weeks to reach the conclusion. The official also informed that several other business houses of Ludhiana are on the department’s radar for fleecing the government of taxes.
