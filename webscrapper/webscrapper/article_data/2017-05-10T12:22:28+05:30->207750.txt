PANAJI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to people to give up their   subsidy has received a meek response in Goa. Data shared by the three public sector oil marketing companies –  , Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil Corporation has revealed that of the 4,55,908 LPG customers in the state, only 42,112 opted out.

 “We will be again initiating an awareness drive about giving up the LPG subsidy. The money relieved from the subsidy will be used in providing support to poor households under the pradhan mantri ujjwala yojana (PMUY),” senior sales officer   said.
 
 Talking about the central government’s initiative to make smoke-free kitchens by substituting fuels like kerosene and firewood by LPG, Bhagat said that under the PMUY, people will be provided cylinders without paying any deposit fee. “The deposit is Rs 1,450 for the first cylinder and Rs 150 for the regulator which would not be charged for new connections. The deposit amount is being paid by the government to the oil companies through the money received from people giving up their subsidy. Subsequent refills of the cylinders will be charged as usual,” Bhagat said.
 
 “In Goa, LPG penetration is at 127%, which means that the number of connections is more than the number of households. Data shows 1,200 people in Goa are eligible for the scheme. The state government is also having its own scheme in providing LPG connection, so PMUY hasn’t received the response it got in other states. We plan to declare Goa as a green state,” he said.
