Chennai: The Joint Commissioner of Labour (JCIT), Hyderabad on Tuesday sent a notice to US headquartered Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS) with regard to the alleged job cuts initiated by the Company. 

 The JCIT of Rangareddy zone, Hyderabad has fixed a mediation meeting to be held on Thursday to resolve the dispute. 
 
 This comes in response to a petition filed by 7 CTS employees through the Forum for IT Employees (FITE), alleging that they were being forced to sign voluntary resignation letters.
 
 CTS last week announced a voluntary separation programme for directors, associate VPs and senior VPs. About 1,000 executives are expected to go. The company, one of the top performers in the industry, is expected to eventually cut at least 6,000 jobs, or 2.3% of its total workforce. Last Thursday, ten CTS employees, through the FITE filed a petition with the assistant commissioner of labour in Chennai.
 
 FITE representatives intend to meet labour commissioners in Bengaluru and Kolkata as well this week.
 
 Large IT services companies are all in the process of laying off employees. Those taking the hit first are mid and senior level professionals, those with 10 to 20 years of experience, but the expectation is that lower level employees too will be hurt later in the year. The situation is worsening to a point where affected employees are beginning to approach labour unions to take up their cause.
