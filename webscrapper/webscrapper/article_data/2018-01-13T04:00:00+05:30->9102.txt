Surat: A financier fired two rounds in air from his licensed revolver after a group of 10 men damaged his car in Radhaswami Society of Ved Road here on Friday. No one was injured in the incident.  Financier Anil Patel submitted a complaint against the group to the police, who booked them under IPC Sections 143, 147, 148, 149, 452, 427, 504 and 506(2). Police said they have also lodged a manhunt for rival financier, who was seen with the group.  According to the complaint, Anil’s son Vraj, who is an engineering student, was being threatened by a man in the office of his rival. Vraj was threatened by the accused to keep his head down whenever he passed through the office of his father’s business rival. Vraj told about the threat to his father, who called up the financier to know the problem. But the financier threatened Anil too.  A group of 10 men then arrived near Anil’s house and attacked his car with blunt weapons on Friday. The glasses of his vehicle were broken. Anil came out of his car and fired two rounds from his licensed revolver. This scared the attackers and they fled the spot. Sources said the reason for enmity between the two financiers seems to be a financial dispute.  An officer of Chowk Bazaar police station said, “We have registered a case and launched a manhunt for the accused. We will know about the facts once we catch all the accused.”
