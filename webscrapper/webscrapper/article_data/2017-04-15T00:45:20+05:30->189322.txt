Salem: About 20 people suffered injuries after the Salem City Police resorted to lathi-charge to control the crowd gathered at a function attended by popular film actress   on Friday.

 The actress was in the city to attend a function organised by AVR Swarna Mahal Jewellery situated on Salem-Omalur Road, police sources said. “The function was scheduled around 10am. As people started gathering in front of the showroom, traffic on the stretch was affected. When the actress was getting ready to leave the place after the function, people began moving towards the dias where she was seated and urged her to spend some more time there. They also urged the shop owners to bring her to the front side of the showroom. During the melee, barricades installed to control the crowd were damaged. We had to intervene to bring the situation under control,” a police officer told TOI.
 
 Police rushed to the spot and resorted to mild lathi-charge. People started running from the place and some of them fell down. More than 20 people received minor injuries, police sources said.
 
 Meanwhile, social activists condemned the police action. “More than 10,000 people had assembled before the showroom to see the actress. However, only 50 cops were deployed at the spot to handle the crowd,” said Poomozhi, president of the Tamil Nadu Makkal Urimai Katchi.
 
 Meanwhile, a senior police officer said, “We tried our best to manage the crowd. But, it was difficult to control more than 10,000 people.”
