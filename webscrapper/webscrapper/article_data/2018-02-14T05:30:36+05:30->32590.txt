NEW DELHI:   on Tuesday saw   being held in the campus as teachers — in solidarity with the students’   against   —   in the  ,   and  .

 While the JNU administration has admonished students for continuing their protests against the ruling and even slapped fines worth Rs 10,000 each on the four office-bearers of the union, students have refused to mark their attendance. 
 
 Taking this as an example of “JNU’s culture”, students said that their call for boycotting compulsory education should not be taken as their opposition to education.
 
 “Boycotting attendance does not mean the boycott of classes. In JNU, teachers are taking classes in the open. We believe that knowledge cannot be acquired with force. So, both teachers and students demanding freedom to exchange knowledge are employing this method,” former JNU joint secretary Rama Naga wrote on social media.
 
 The students said that they will not let go of the freedom to study. “We want to study and contribute to the nation, but will not follow arbitrary policies,” a student said.
 
 Extending their support to students who were willing to study, several teachers conducted classes despite abandoning their classrooms. “We are showing solidarity with the students who are fighting for a cause and to show the world that they are not against education. We strongly believe that students want to study but cannot be forced to do so and will, as per JNU tradition, find ways to get what they want,” said Archana Prasad, a professor at the university.
 
 The university administration has been sending notices to students asking them not to protest around the administrative block as it is against the university rules. The office-bearers have been asked to pay the fine in the next 10 days.
