Chennai: The Madras high court on Friday gave the green signal to overseas travel plans of  , son of former Union finance minister P Chidambaram, despite strong objections from the CBI in view of pending lookout circulars issued against him. 

 However, the relief is not without conditions. Karti has been directed to inform his entire travel plans, including the places of visit, to the CBI in advance. He must also return to India by February 28.
 
 This apart, Karti has been directed not to close any of his bank accounts and to appear before the CBI as and when required. The first bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Abdul Quddhose passed the interim order on a plea moved by Karti assailing the validity of lookout circulars issued against him and seeking permission to travel abroad. 
 
 Karti was restrained to leave India by the CBI, which issued lookout circulars against him in connection with an FIR registered by the agency in the alleged irregular approval of Rs 305 crore foreign investment in INX Media in 2007, allegedly at the behest of Karti when his father was the Union finance minister. The notices were issued on August 16 and August 18. 
 
 Earlier, during the course of hearing, senior counsel Gopal Subramanium contended that Karti had already appeared before the agency for inquiry and assured cooperation in future. This apart, he and his family were before the court and he was not a fugitive against whom lookout notices could be issued, he said. Opposing the arguments, additional solicitor general G Rajagopalan said, “He is seeking permission for a business trip. If it is for any emergency or medical reasons, the agency would not have objected to it. But when it comes to his private interest and interest of the probe, the latter prevails. Moreover, his business affair is the subject matter of the probe.”
