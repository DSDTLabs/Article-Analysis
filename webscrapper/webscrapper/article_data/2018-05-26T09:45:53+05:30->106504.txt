PANAJI: With the central government putting in place various mechanisms for land deals and transactions by foreigners under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA), the state government, with immediate effect, has dissolved a committee it appointed in August 2013 to scrutinise all land deals by foreigners following allegations of violations of   during land purchase in Goa.

 
  
 
 While the committee has been dissolved, NRIs, OCIs and PIOs can now get their transactions scrutinised at the lower-rungs of the civil registrars-cum-sub-registrars (CRSR) at taluka headquarters, an official said.
 
 The committee was also tasked with processing of pending, future applications regarding purchase or sale of property by Person of Indian Origin (PIO),   (OCI), etc. 
 
 The precursor to the dissolution of the committee is perhaps orders published in the official gazette. “Through these orders, the government of India granted more powers to OCIs, on par with non-resident Indians (NRIs),” an official said.
 
 An OCI card holder could not sell his property, and would end up gifting it to a relative. All this has changed with the two recent orders issued by the government, sources said. The transactions of immovable properties has been simplified for PIOs. 
 
 The CRSRs will perform various tasks, including scrutinising document presented before them prior to registration of the transaction for transfer of immovable property involving Indian origin persons covered under FEMA regulations and guidelines. This is to ensure that the transfer of property is permissible under the said regulations. 
 
 The state government has issued instructions to state authorities concerned to ensure that the provisions of FEMA and various guidelines, memoranda and other directives issued by the central government,   and other statutory authorities, regarding transactions of immovable properties for PIOs, are fulfilled.
