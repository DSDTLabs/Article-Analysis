Vishwas Paandya’s 'Baa Baaa Black Sheep' is a romcom starring   and Manjari Fadnnis, Anupam Kher, Annu Kapoor, and Kay Kay Menon.
 Shaan’s band Superbia — comprising   and   — had begun working on the tracks back in 2014. The trio touched up the music later. 
 
 Shaan’s band has created tracks that work in tandem with the quirks of the storyline. The songs are organic and fit completely with the flavour of the comic caper. 
 
 'Baa Baaa Black Sheep', the title track of the film is a club song with a strong folk influence. Sung (and a rap) by Shaan and Manisha Chakravarty, this foot-tapping dance track has quirky lyrics written by Sunil Sirvaiya. 
 
 The next 'Heer', is a love song with a twist. With Gourav’s guitar being predominant, it’s a soft romantic number that gives you Mika Singh in a different avatar. The talented Mahalakshmi,who is underutilized in the industry, nails the track with her honeyed voice.
 
 'Angelina' is a four-minute proposal song, which traces the lives of the lead pair from age 12 to 25. Sonu Nigam owns this fun and racy track. The Brazilain Samba in Angelina is refreshing. Taufiq Qureshi’s expertise on the percussion is utilised well by the composers.
 
 'Ram Leela' is a cheeky bhajan with a definitive rock twist. Sung by Kumar Sapan, with backing vocals by lyricist Rajesh Manthan, this is another quirky track. 'Galla Goriyan' was recreated by Superbia and the fab rendition of item song specialists Mika Singh and Kanika Kapoor will make you hit replay. This track might be scaling the charts soon.
