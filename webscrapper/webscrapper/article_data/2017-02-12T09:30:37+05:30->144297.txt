HYDERABAD: Officials of BC Residential Schools are scouting for suitable vacant buildings to accommodate as many as 119 new Backward Classes community residential schools in the 31 districts from the ensuing academic year .

 Chief minister   wants all these residential schools to start imparting education from June-2017. What's more, officials of BC Residential Schools have written to the District Collectors to look for buildings with a minimum of 20,000 sq ft built up area comprising classrooms, wash rooms, toilets, kitchen and other facilities essential to run the schools.
 
 While getting suitable buildings is not much of a problem in the districts, it is going to be a huge task for the officials to identify such buildings in Hyderabad.The officials are searching for availability of government buildings. In case such buildings are not available, government has given permission to take on rent or lease private buildings to accommodate residential schools.
 
 “The rentals are high in Hyderabad, Medchal and   districts. We are hopeful of getting suitable accommodation in Hyderabad too. Fifteen schools have been allotted in Hyderabad district at the rate of one for each assembly constituency ,“ a senior official said.
 
 Almost every assembly constituency in the state has got one BC residential school. Interestingly , there are more number of residential schools for girls planned than for boys. There are 63 residential schools for girls and 56 for boys.
