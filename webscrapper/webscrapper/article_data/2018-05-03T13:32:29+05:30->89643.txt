PATNA: RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son  , who made headlines after he threatened to disrupt the marriage ceremony of Sushil Kumar Modi’s son last year, called on the deputy CM on Tuesday to invite him to his wedding slated for May 12.

 SuMo accepted the invitation card and consented to attend the wedding. “I have attended weddings of all daughters of Lalu despite our political rivalry,” SuMo said.
 
 Tej later tweeted: “I have invited Bihar deputy CM   for my wedding… We, the people of Bahujan community, are descendants of Lord Krishna. Despite lakhs of political and Manuwadi adversaries imposed on us, we have a bid heart with space for everyone.”
 
 SuMo’s son Utkarsh tied the knot on December 3 last year. Tej at a public meeting at Aurangabad had said on November 22, “I've been invited by Modi to attend his son's wedding. If I go there, I will expose him in public. Uske ghar mein ghus kar maarenge, uss shaadi mein vahin sabha karenge, tod- phod karenge (Will thrash him inside his house, hold a public meeting and vandalise the marriage venue).”
 
 Tej also went to the Raj Bhawan on Tuesday and invited governor Satya Pal Malik. Sources said CM   has also been invited.
 
 A Class XII passout, Tej will be taking wedding vows with former Bihar CM Daroga Prasad Rai’s granddaughter  , a grad from DU’s   and MBA from Amity, Delhi.
