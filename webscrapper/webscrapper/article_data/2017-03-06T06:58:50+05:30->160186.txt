  The programme, jointly organised by Ramaiah Institute of Technology and the  , is a platform for experts, researchers, practitioners and students to exchange ideas on technologies and practical experiences related to smarter cities. The symposium covers various aspects of smarter cities, such as energy, education, transportation, healthcare, pollution, tourism, governance and water.
  
  Around 20 teams from all across the country have made it to the finale. Among all competent, Bhaskar and Shashwat, both 15 years of age, are the only ones who are studying in school. The duo have developed an online forum – www.cityzen.xyz. Speaking about the portal, Bhaskar said Cityzen is a smart platform for addressing public complains of smarter cities. “Lack of a smart and centralized complaint redressal platform in India is causing delay in the process of addressing it and leaves a huge number of complaints unaddressed each year. On Cityzen, complaints could be lodged by public and would be addressed by the administration based on the priority of the complaint,” he said.
  
  “On our platform, after signing up and filling the necessary details like name, address, city, state, contact number and pin code, one can proceed to lodge a complaint. After the complaint is lodged, the platform generates a priority score for each complaint and they are sorted accordingly into three categories – high, mid and low,” said Shashwat.
  
  This is not the first time that the boys have made their parents and city proud. Previously, they developed a cloud-based application – ‘Collobe’ – which helps team leader to assign tasks within organizations. Their innovative business idea was shortlisted in a television series – ‘The Vault’ – which is inspired by the American television series ‘Shark Tank’.
