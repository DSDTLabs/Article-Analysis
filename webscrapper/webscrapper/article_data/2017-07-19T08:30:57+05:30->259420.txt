GANDHINAGAR: Elections for the three   of Gujarat will be held on August 8, in Gandhinagar, according to a press statement issued by the   (CEO) of Gujarat on Tuesday. The three seats are presently represented two BJP leaders, Union textiles and information and broadcasting minister   and BJP veteran Dilip Pandya. Ahmed Patel, the political secretary to All India   holds the third seat.

  
  While the BJP will mostly likely renominate Irani, it is expected that a Patidar or OBC leader will fill Pandya’s place. BJP has not revealed a likely name for the seat.
 
 A notification in this regard will be published on July 21. The last date for nominations is July 28. July 31 is the last date for withdrawal of nominations. Voting will be held on August 8. 
 
 After Shankersinh Vaghela, openly criticised the party high command and indirectly targeted Ahmed Patel for the poor state of Congress in Gujarat, it is possible that about 15 of Congress’s 57 MLAs may vote against the Congress nominee, if it is Patel (which is most likely). 
 
 The pro-Patel faction is ready to neutralize any such move, citing a 2003 amendment to the Representation of the People Act, legislated by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. A senior Congress leader within the Patel faction said, “Section 59 in The Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951 and Election Rules 39(A)(A) say that, ‘The manner of voting at elections: At every election where a poll is taken, votes shall be given by ballot in such manner as may be prescribed and save as expressly provided by this Act, no votes shall be received by proxy; The votes at every election to fill a seat or seats in the Council of States shall be given by open ballot.’ Under these provisions, the presiding officer is liable to check the vote of the MLA and if an MLA votes against his party’s nomination, consider it null and void.”
