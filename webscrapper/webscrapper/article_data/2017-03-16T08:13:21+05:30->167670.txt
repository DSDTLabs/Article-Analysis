HYDERABAD: The   on Wednesday gave a clean chit to   in the state with regard to the   used in  . When he was asked “whether it is also a fact that the rates of stents are not uniform and hospitals are charging exorbitant',   Dr C Laxma Reddy denied the charges.

 He, however, added that the State Drug Control Authority was monitoring the prices as per the notification issued by the National Pharmaceuticals' Pricing Authority on February 13.
 
 He said that 36 hospitals have been inspected and were found to be following the controlled pricing of Rs 7,260 for a non-coated stent and Rs 29,600 for a drug-coated or drug eluting stent. Of the around three lakh deaths recorded in the state each year, about 18,000 result from cardiac health issues, he added. The question was posed by Congress members T Ram Mohan Reddy , SA Sampath Kumar, G Chinna Reddy and T Jeevan Reddy . Sampath Kumar wanted to know how the government could claim that hospitals were following the prescribed prices for stents.
 
 He also wanted the government to set up a committee of experts to monitor and control the pricing of stents to prevent cheating of patients by private and corporate hospitals. “Though officially the prices have been reduced, the government must ensure implementation of this decision,“ he said.
 
 TRS member V Srinivas Goud wanted to know if the government would be able to procure stents and be a centralised distribution hub to prevent private hospitals from charging any price they like. Laxma Reddy also said that the state government would soon adopt The Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act of the central government.
 
 This will help the government monitor the functioning of all hospitals, including single doctor clinics and allow the government to penalise those not adhering to prescribed service standards and requirements. “A special officer will be appointed to oversee implementation of the Act,“ the minister said.
