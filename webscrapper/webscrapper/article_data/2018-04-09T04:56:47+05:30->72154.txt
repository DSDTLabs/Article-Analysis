KOLKATA: Concerned at the country’s pollution levels rising at an alarming rate, a 22-year-old cyclist from Manipur’s   has taken it up on himself to crusade against the environmental threat. Philem   rode 1,600km to Kolkata on a bicycle to spread awareness about pollution.

 Starting from   on March 19, Rohan reached Kolkata on Friday night.
 
  
  
 Rohan’s concern for the environment was awakened during his stay in Delhi last November. On Diwali the capital city had been engulfed in a thick blanket of smog, making him wonder how could he contribute towards the conservation of the environment. Later, he took his first solo cycle trip from Delhi on January 8 this year reaching Imphal 28 days later. “I was extremely disturbed when I saw the kind of pollution during the Diwali in November 2017. I pledged to contribute in my own way to create awareness on pollution,” Rohan told TOI.
 
 This time the graduate from DM College Imphal started his journey from Imphal on March 19 with the Italy-made Java cycle. The campaign was sponsored by Metro Cycle, Paona Bazar. Rohan covered around 100km a da y riding about seven to eight hours. He stopped at different places, specially in schools and colleges on his way, interacting with students.
 
 “I would also stop and speak to onlookers who wanted to know why I was undertaking the cycle journey,” Rohan said.
 
 Having lost his father a few years ago, Rohan’s grandparents — who brought him up — were initially reluctant about his decision. But later he convinced them about the cause. But finding sponsors was a problem. Luckily   revenue minister   handed him a cheque of Rs50,000, while a Moirang MLA chipped in with Rs5,000.
 
 “Apart from dehydration, I did not face any problem during the journey. I am going to continue my campaign,” he added.
