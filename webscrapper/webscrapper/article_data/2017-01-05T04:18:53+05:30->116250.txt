NEW DELHI: In a video message, Delhi   chief   hit back at   for misinterpreting the song in a video circulated by them. He said AAP is making an issue out of nothing.

 “AAP’s objection is that I called people standing in queues (outside banks and ATMs) as patriots. How can calling people patriots be interpreted as making fun of them?” Tiwari said on Wednesday in Ludhiana.
 
 BJP members said that Tiwari’s visit to slums has got AAP nervous and they are picking non-issues to target him. “There is wide spread resentment among people as new development work has come to a standstill. AAP has a problem as Tiwari is voicing their concern,” said Aman Sinha, Delhi BJP spokesperson.
 
 “CM’s main problem with me is that I’m doing a reality check of the jhuggis. The living conditions are inhuman. I’ll ask   to visit these areas and listen to the problems of people who voted his party to power,”
 
 Tiwari said that BJP has made videos on the pathetic condition of Delhi slums. “I’ll ask Delhiittes to make these videos viral so that people can see the reality,” he added.
