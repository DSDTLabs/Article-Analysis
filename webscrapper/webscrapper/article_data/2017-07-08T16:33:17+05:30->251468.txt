HYDERABAD: The   on Saturday launched second phase of its   with the TJAC chairman launching a three-day tour of the  . Unlike the first phase of the yatra from June 21 to June 24 which passed through Sangareddy, Medak and Siddipet districts, the second phase will focus exclusively on  , the district represented by IT minister  .

 The yatra will conclude with a public meeting in Sircilla town on Monday. "While the district is small, it has a lot of history, and has been home to several people's movements," according to Prof M Kodandaram, TJAC's chairman. Announcing tour plans for Sircilla, Kodandaram said the original belief that any issue can be brought to the notice of the government through dialogue has come a cropper. "Even agitating to bring issues to the notice of the government has failed. Now the choice is to unite as one and demand that the government take steps to deliver on promises and fulfil Telangana people's dreams," he said.
 
 "The yatra draws on the spirit of those who gave up their lives for the cause of Telangana. The government must be reminded that it is born out of our votes and as such its responsibility is to the people for which it has to work," Kodandaram said.
 
 Sircilla, Kodandaram said, has turned into a hub for illegal sand mining which is thriving under the patronage of political leaders. "Instead of hurling abuse at me and spending energy criticising me, political leaders should use their time and energy in ensuring problems faced by people are solved. The tour in Siricilla will highlight problems faced by handloom and beedi industries workers," he said.
