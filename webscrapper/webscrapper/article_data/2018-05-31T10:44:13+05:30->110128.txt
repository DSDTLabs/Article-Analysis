PANAJI: The National Organisation for Tobacco Eradication (NOTE), Goa, on Wednesday made a case for a crackdown on tobacco users on the lines of the   scheme that has helped bring errant motorists to task. 

 
 Speaking on the eve of World No Tobacco Day, NOTE secretary Dr  , said he would meet with DGP   is credited for the success of the Traffic Sentinel schemeto seek his assistance in launching a similar initiative to report instances of public smoking and gutka-chewing.
 
 “The Traffic Sentinel scheme is the easiest way to report a traffic violation. Similarly, citizens could take a picture of a tobacco-use violation and send it to the police, or a voluntary organisation that can forward it to the police. The scheme could help counter tobacco use as well. I will ask the DGP if we can do this with people’s involvement,” he said.
 
 The legal advisor of a voluntary organisation,  , stressed on the need for vendor licensing as an instrument to tackle the issue. “If we regulate vendors, we could enforce tobacco control laws on them. If they violate the laws, their licences could be cancelled and they could be held accountable,” he said.
 
 Singh also said the move was already implemented by municipal corporations in Lucknow, Patna and Kolkata.
