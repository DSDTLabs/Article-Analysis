GAYA: Gaya DM   has directed   to inquire into the complaints of   payment and physical torture of the minor girl who earlier complained to the DM against coercion by her parents to force her to marry against her wish.

 Rajni (name changed), in the complaint addressed to the DM, also alleged that the prospective groomâ€™s father was paid Rs one lakh in dowry. Following the DM's pro-active intervention on Thursday, the marriage now stands stalled.
 
 The girl's father told TOI on Saturday he paid Rs one lakh to the person named by her daughter, but asserted that it was not dowry money. Asked why then the marginal farmer -cum- daily wage earner paid the princely amount to the tailor named by her daughter as the prospective groom's father, the man fumbled for an answer.
 
 According to advocate Ashok Kumar, the complaint merits institution of a criminal case under various Sections of the Indian Penal Code and special Acts aimed at preventing dowry and child marriage. An   triggers the law into motion, said the advocate.
