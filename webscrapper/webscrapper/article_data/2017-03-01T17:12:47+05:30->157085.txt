AHMEDABAD: Inspired by Akshay Kumar-starrer  , an Ahmedabad based lawyer launched a sit-in protest outside the metropolitan court room against the in-charge judge.

 Ajay Shekhawat, a city-based criminal lawyer, got irritated after waiting for over three hours for the metropolitan judge.
 
 "It was holiday and the court was called for the hearing an important case," an eye-witness said, adding, "All, including accused, police and lawyers, were present in the court premises by 12 pm and by 3pm public too had gathered outside the court room but only the in-charge judge was missing." 
 
 Despite of the protest the judge didn't turn up till 4pm.
  
 The lawyer finally called police control room to complain about the delay caused by the judge.
 
 Interestingly, as soon as the judge was informed about the turn of events, he immediately reached the court.
 
 But the furious lawyer was now in no mood to allow anyone in the court room. It was only after intervention of other lawyers that the court proceedings could started normally.
 
 According to the  's E-Committee statistics report on pending cases in district courts, released in 2016, there are more than 2.18 crore cases pending in district courts across the country; 12 states have more than 5 lakh cases to decide; while a little more than one case, on an average, is awaiting conclusion for at least 10 years.
