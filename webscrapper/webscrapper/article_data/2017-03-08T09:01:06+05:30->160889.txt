JAIPUR: Twenty patients of silicosis, who had been confirmed with the disease some months ago, received certificates from the   on Monday at a   organized at the primary health centre at Langra in Karauli district. 

 In all, 182 people were screened – 80 with symptoms of tuberculosis. Since there were no x-ray facilities, people suspected to be suffering from silicosis were asked to go to the Karauli district hospital.
 
 The need for a camp to expedite diagnosis was felt after a public hearing last month, at which about 1,000 people turned up with medical complaints. 
 
 Arun Jindal, who works with the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, said, “We called the district health officials too, and it was clear that there was need for a special medical camp. Chief medical officer Dinesh Meena distributed the certificates to 20   who had been waiting long for certification.” Since 2013, once a patient is diagnosed as silicosis-positive, Rs1 lakh is offered towards treatment expenses by the state government. After the patient dies, his or her kin receive Rs3 lakh in compensation. The release of money only happens if a patient has the   from the Pneumoconiosis Board.
 
 Medical officials explained to mine workers the precautions they should take while working in mines – they should cover their noses with a wet cloth and not expose themselves to silica dust, which is what lodges in the lungs and causes silicosis. Ideally, mines should only operate with wet drilling techniques. However, this is often not observed as water is hard to come by.
