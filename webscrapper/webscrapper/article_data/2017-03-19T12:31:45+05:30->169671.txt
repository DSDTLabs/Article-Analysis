PANAJI: Former Congress leader  , who resigned from the   and the   on Saturday, has slammed the party for appointing Quepem MLA Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar as the   (CLP) leader.

 “Kavalekar has not attended a CLP meeting in last five years, but was appointed as CLP leader! Shame. I was called a spy of BJP by Congress Party. I resigned because I was disillusioned by the party that doesn’t have a future,” Rane said. 
 
 He was reacting to a statement made by Kavlekar that Rane was a spy for the BJP.
 
 Rane, who quit the party in a huff after abstaining from a crucial floor test, pinned the blame squarely on   for the party’s failure to form the government in Goa.
