KOLHAPUR: On one hand the district administration is trying its best to attract tourists to the city, while on the other autorickshaw drivers are leaving no stone unturned to fleece them by refusing to ply by charges set by the government or using tampered metres.

 Not only tourists, local residents too face a tough time dealing with errant auto drivers. But nothing much has been done by the traffic police to penalise them.
 
 Motiram Pol, a resident of Jaisinghpur in Himachal Pradesh, said, “I asked an autorickshaw driver at Central Bus Stand (CBS) to take me to Mahalaxmi temple. I insisted to pay the fare as per the meter but he demanded Rs 80. I asked other autorickshaw drivers but they too stuck to the Rs 80 tag. After walking some distance, I got an autorickshaw who agreed to charge as per the meter.”
 
 Suyash Patil, a city resident, said, “As we live in the suburbs our dependence on autorickshaws is more than those residing in central parts of the city. The auto drivers are so adamant that they hardly negotiate on fares. So, we are forced to pay more.”
 
 Netaji Patil, another resident, said, “My experience of travelling by auto is bad. The drivers refuse to charge by meter. A driver who agreed to charge as per the meter had tampered with it and I was asked to pay much more than the actual fare.”
 
 President of   Subhash Shete accepted that few drivers may be overcharging. “The citizen should lodge a complaint with us and the RTO about such incidents. As per norms auto drivers should use electronic meters. They should not tamper with the meter. But there are some auto rickshaw drivers who do not follow the rules,” he said.
 
 Regional transport officer   said, “We always keep a check on the meters and organize surprise raids. The citizens should note down the number of the autorickshaws and inform us. We will take necessary action against them.”
