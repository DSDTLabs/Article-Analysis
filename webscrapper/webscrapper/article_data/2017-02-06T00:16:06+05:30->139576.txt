NEW DELHI: The   registrar, in a series of tweets, termed the protests by students as “unwarranted”, and said that the university administration was doing everything to “ensure social justice” in the campus.

 “Hunger strike by few   is unwarranted when   administration is doing everything possible to ensure social justice (sic),” said the registrar Pramod Kumar in a tweet. This was in relation to the hunger strike that JNUSU was holding for six days. Kumar also urged students to consider the “silent majority” of those students who were not protesting and to not “spoil” their future.
