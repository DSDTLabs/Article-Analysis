 Sources informed that a total of 1,100 policemen including rapid action police (RAP) and quick reaction teams (QRT) carrying lathis, tear gas and arms were deployed in the city to ensure peace during the protests. Around 300 policemen were deployed at the Vidhan Sabha ground where thousands of para-teachers from across the state gathered to protest. Top civil and police officials including ADM law and order Girja Shankar, SP (city) Aman Kumar and Ranchi sub-divisional officer (SDO) were present at the spot.
 
 "We expected the protest of the para-teachers to be more volatile so there was more deployment. Vehicles too were checked at areas under every police station," said Aman Kumar.
 
 DSP (control room) TK Jha informed that eight QRTs, six units of tear shells and six anti-riot vehicles were deployed at the Vidhan Sabha ground. "We had instructions to use force only if the para-teachers try to march towards the education minister's house," he said.
 
 Around 200 police personnel were posted at the Harmu ground where the adivasi rally to prevent Kurmi from being recognised as a tribe was held. Fire engines, QRTs and tear gas units were deployed at the spot too.
 
 Police personnel along with fire engines were also stationed at various places on the routes of the adivasi rally. With over 500 vehicles carrying protesters for the two rallies entering the city on Saturday, special arrangements were made to avoid traffic congestion. The traffic police stopped the movement of vehicles at places to ensure that the participants for the rallies moved smoothly.
 
 Several roads in the city including the ones connecting Ratu and Harmu localities, however, witnessed traffic jams in the afternoon. The para-teachers also blocked the road leading to the Vidhan Sabha for about an hour during their protest.
