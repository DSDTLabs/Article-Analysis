SAMASTIPUR: Altogether 14 ashtadhatu idols were looted from a mutt at Narghoghi village in Sarairanjan police station of Samastipur district on Wednesday night. 

 The looted idols are said to be worth several crore. Samastipur SP Dipak Ranjan said all efforts are being made to nab the criminals. 
 
 A police dog which was brought to the spot did not prove to be of much help. Resentment prevails among the villagers following the sensational loot which has shaken the faith of the people in police administration. “It is indeed surprising that despite the presence of three armed policemen at the mutt criminals looted the idols of Ram-Janki, Lord Hanuman, Radha-Krishna and Jaggannathji,” said an agitated villager. 
 
 According to sources in the village, about 10 armed men raided the mutt around midnight and overpowered the mahant Bajrangi Das and the three police constables deputed there and took away the idols. The criminals, however abandoned the guns which they had snatched from the constables. The guns were later recovered from a village well.
 
 Police are interrogating the mahant and some more people in connection with the loot. No arrest has been made in this connection till the time of filing this report.
