 While Shabbir plays an Indian rock star on the show, Mishaal will be seen as King Singh, an NRI rock star. He says, “It’s a positive character, whose entry will shake the very foundation of Abhi (Shabbir) and Pragya’s (Sriti) relationship. My character is flashy, flamboyant and OTT. Playing an over-the -top character can be quite challenging for an actor. It’s important not to cross the line,” he says. 
 
 The character seems to be tailor-made for the actor, as he is inclined towards music and learning it since about a year. he says, “I can play the guitar and have started composing tunes. Given a chance, I would love to sing on the show.”
