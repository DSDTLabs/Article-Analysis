NEW DELHI: He didn't know this would happen when he suggested it yesterday, but Pakistani politician Imran's Khan wish that   include 
  , may just come true.

 The former cricketer expressed this startling wish of his at a rally yesterday of his party Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI). And hours later, White House Chief of Staff   told CBS News it is possible Pakistan may be added to the list of seven countries whose nationals are barred from entering the US. Preibus said that for now Pakistanis will face "extreme vetting."
 
 But why does Imran want Pakistan on that list? Here's his rationale, in his own words, as quoted by The Nation: 
 
  "Now that Trump has become the (US) president, it is likely his travel ban will be extended to Pakistan. I think, to an extent, and I want all Pakistanis to hear it, that he should go ahead and extend the ban to Pakistanis so that we can focus on fixing our country." 
 
 That's one way to do things, some would say. 
 
 The PTI chief elaborated a bit on his wish, The Nation said. 
 
 According to him, most educated Pakistanis leave the country because they believe only knowing someone powerful will get them a good job if they stay on.
 
 "The day we bring back the merit system back to Pakistan, all our best citizens will return and work for the betterment of this country," Imran said, adding that the country can only improve if its citizens work for progress, if corruption is curbed and when justice is delivered.
 
 The former Pakistan captain also ranted against his favourite punching bags - Prime Minister  , the US and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 
 "We will have to fix Pakistan... the day we decide this is our home and we have to fix it, we won't beg for loans from the US and IMF," he said.
 
 About Sharif: "He goes abroad even if he has headache." 
 
 And somewhat dramatically, he added that the day Pakistan got a government that is convinced it has to live and die in Pakistan, the country would be fixed.
