NEW DELHI: A three-year-old girl was crushed by a school bus near   on Monday evening while she was playing on the road with her friends. The bus driver was caught after locals chased and stopped the vehicle. He was thrashed before being handed over to the police.

 Around 6.30pm, the child, Gudiya, ran onto the road and came under the wheels of the RTV coming from Kalkaji. She was rushed to a private hospital where she was declared dead on arrival. The girl’s father, Mukesh, is a labourer and the family stays in a shack under the Nehru Place flyover. Other family members beg for alms at the traffic signal.
 
 The family members later staged a protest demanding a home for them due to which traffic at the crossing was halted for an hour. The child’s body has been sent to AIIMS for autopsy.
 
 The bus driver told the police that he could not apply the brakes on time as the child suddenly ran onto the road. A case for causing death due to negligence has been registered against him.
 
 Police said they have contacted the civic body to arrange for rehabilitation of the families that live under the flyover as accidents involving them are a common occurrence.
