HYDERABAD: As heritage activists and city historians gear up to celebrate the 453rd birth anniversary of Sultan   V, founder of Hyderabad and builder of Charminar, on Wednesday, the demand for renaming of Hyderabad international airport after the ruler gets louder.

 Mohammad Quli, who is often associated with the legendary  , was born on April 4, 1565 CE. The now global city of Hyderabad owes its origin to the foresight of Quli and heritage activists demand that the most befitting tribute to the foundingfather of Hyderabad is to rename the city airport after him. City historians cite the example of Bengaluru airport, which was named after Kempe Gowda I, who founded Bengaluru in 1537 CE. Bhopal airport was also named after a former ruler, Raja Bhoj, who founded Bhojpur.
 
 Incidentally, the ongoing Charminar pedestrianisation project comes as a tribute to Mohammad Quli in the 500th year of the foundation of the Qutub Shahi dynasty. The ruler had prayed while laying the foundation of Hyderabad that his city should always be teeming with people like the sea with fish. And since 1591 CE, when Charminar was built, Hyderabad has always been a home of people of all hues, castes, religions, communities, languages and cultures.
 
 City historians and heritage activists have selected Darul Shifa as the venue to pay homage to Mohammad Quli. Darul Shifa, built in 1595 four years after Charminar, it is the oldest extant hospital building in Asia. A special badge with the portrait of the Qutub Shahi ruler would be released on the occasion.
