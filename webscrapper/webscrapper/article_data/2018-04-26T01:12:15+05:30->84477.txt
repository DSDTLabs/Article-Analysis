Namakkal: State electricity minister P Thangamani inaugurated an early intervention centre for disabled children at the Government Higher Secondary School at Kumarapalayam near here on Tuesday.  Thangamani said that the center has equipment such as parallel bar, neck control, truck balance, trampoline, calf-muscle exerciser, ankle exerciser, bean bag, wax bath, bolster, peg board and sand bags. “These would support disabled children aged between one and five to carry out their day-to-day needs on their own,” he said. He said that the disabled children could not do their works such as eating food, drinking water and even attending nature’s call. They have to depend on either of the parents or guardian.  The minister advised the youth not to marry close relatives. The minister allotted Rs 3 lakh from his constitutional development fund for the centre.  Thangamani handed over cheque for Rs 50,000 each to eight students who had lost their father or mother in road accidents. He also honoured Kumarapalayam JKK Rangammal Girls Higher Secondary School headmistress M R Nalinidevi and Valaiyapatty government higher secondary school zoological teacher P Tamilselvan for not taking leave even for a single day in the academic year 2016-17.
