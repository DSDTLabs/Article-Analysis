 PSEB scam in 2016
 
 TOI had last year exposed how during the SAD rule, the PSEB had begun a practice of inflating pass percentage by offering grace marks to both class X and XII students. In 2016, the class XII students were given 30 grace marks each and it helped the pass percentage jump by 22% across all streams. 
 
 Similarly, for class X results, the board had asked two of its Delhi-based software firms to submit four different formulae to award 27 grace marks to each student who was failing. From 1,34,471 passed students, the number of passed students had shot up to 2,45,509. On August 2, 2016, the Punjab and Haryana high court issued notice to the state education department and the then PSEB chairperson, Tajinder Kaur, alleging misuse of powers by chairperson in awarding grace marks to students of classes X and XII.
