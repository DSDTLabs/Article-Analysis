AHMEDABAD: On Saturday, Parsis came together for the first ever garba event specially organized for their community. Ahmedabad   Panchayat and   held the event at the century-old Parsi sanatorium.

 “The idea was to focus on kids initially. However, we thought we could make it another reason for the whole community to get together,“ said Mehr Medora, the founder of Ushta-Te Foundation.“I am glad all enjoyed it to the fullest.“
 
 Age was indeed no bar as even senior citizens, dressed in traditional Parsi saris, whirled to garba tunes.“When we landed in this country, we wanted to mingle with Indians, as sugar assimilates in milk,“ said  , a 71-year-old who lives near Vijay Crossroads. “So we celebrate all festivals.“ More than 150 people visited the sanatorium, where two Parsi garba songs were also played. “Our fun-loving community embraced the event with joy,“ said Brigadier (retd)  , the president of the Ahmedabad Parsi Panchayat.
