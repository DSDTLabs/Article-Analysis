CHENNAI: The voting process to select a logo for the   project is on. Last week, Greater Chennai Corporation had urged residents to rate seven logos designed by a consultant and also design and upload their own logos.

 More than 30 designs have been submitted and uploaded on 
 . The logos portray skyscrapers, green technologies, transport systems, Wi-Fi accessibility in public and honeycomb like structures that represent all departments involved for the project.
 
 Residents believe it is a good opportunity to showcase their creativity, but say the process could be simpler. “At first we had to rate only seven logos but as public designs are being uploaded now it is painstaking to rate each,” said an independent illustrator,  . “It would be better to choose one best design and decide on the logo which has maximum votes.”
 
 The corporation is also formulating the organisational structure for   (CSCL), the special purpose vehicle for the project. Candidates have been shortlisted and will soon be interviewed for CEO, CFO and company secretary. A project management consultant is alo being finalised.
 
 After the third board meeting last week, the members are negotiating with firms to help plan and execute infrastructure projects for the project that will be launched in the commercial hub of T Nagar. The meeting, however, did not decide whether or not to incorporate in the project a tree inventory using GIS systems. After Cyclone Vardah virtually wiped out the city’s green cover, various NGOs and volunteers groups have been mapping existing and uprooted trees and urging the corporation to do it across the city.
 
 “We are building the manpower structure now. With the whole team on board we will begin to scrutinise projects we have planned,” said corporation deputy commissioner (works) K S Kandasamy. “Every department will call out for separate consultants to prepare detailed project reports for various smart city plans and the final DPR will be submitted to us.”
