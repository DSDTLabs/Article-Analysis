AHMEDABAD:   believe that some in the city could have tried to evade scrutiny after November 8, by depositing   to the tune of Rs 2.30 lakh, quite a bit less than the cap of Rs 2.50 lakh, in  . During the course of inquiry about  , the I-T found the discrepancy in which account holders have not deposited Rs 2.50 lakh, but preferred to deposit a lesser amount that falls short of the cap.

 At least 150 such accounts have been identified. The money was mainly deposited in private banks and a district cooperative bank. I-T sleuths are likely to check the returns of these account holders and if they are found not to be tax assessees, then legal action may be taken against them.
 
 Officials are investigating whether there was any concerted attempt to launder money. Suspicions were raised, as most of these accounts had been lying dormant for over two to three years.
 
 “I-T will conduct thorough inquiry into nearly 150 accounts in each of which deposits of Rs 2.30 lakh was made post demonetization. All of these accounts were lying dormant since over two years. But as demonetization was announced, money flowed into these accounts,” said sources.
 
 Earlier, I-T and other government agencies had told banks to provide details of individuals who deposited Rs 2.50 lakh or more in savings accounts or fixed deposits between November 9 and December 30. Also, deposits of Rs 12.5 lakh or more in a current account needed to be reported to the authorities.
