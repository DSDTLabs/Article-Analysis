BIRUR: It's that time of the year when all roads lead to Birur in the Kadur Taluk of Chikkamagaluru district of  . 

 A cattle fair, which is more than a century old, brought alive the village yesterday. And it was a royal affair, exclusively showcasing Karnataka's flagship Amrit Mahal breed of cattle, known for their strength, endurance and speed.
 
 With the Birur breeding centre putting up 130 calves and a pair of Amrit Mahal bullocks on the block, hundreds of farmers came from distant villages - some on foot even - to participate in the auction . The bullocks owned by the State Animal Husbandary department went under the gavel in the middle of the three-acre fair venue. 
 
 As the bidding began, so did the frenzy as farmers shouted at the top of their voices to outdo their rivals. 
 
 The high point of the fair was, of course, when the bid touched Rs 1,34,400. The proud buyer was Mallanagowda from Masoor. He bought a pair of Amrit Mahal calves at the auction.
