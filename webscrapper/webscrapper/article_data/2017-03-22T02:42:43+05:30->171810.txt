NEW DELHI: The   list of Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) students accepted in the   was released on Tuesday, sending parents in a tizzy about whether there will be a second list before the admissions to open category seats end on March 31.

 Several parents of students who have applied for admission under the EWS quota have not found the name of their wards in the first list, and have also not applied to open category seats. However, the parents who have applied to both categories are worried that the wait for a second list, if any, would also affect their chance of securing a seat under the open category.
 
 According to the Directorate of Education, total number of applications received is 1,13,991, while the number of seats under the EWS quota are 31,653, while accepting that all students have not been allotted seats under the EWS/DG quota.
 
 It was explained in the circular that while some have been accepted to schools in the draw of lots, many have been rejected for incorrect data filled in the application form and some because of unavailability of seats. Officials in DoE said that while some candidates might be rejected because of invalid documents, the EWS seats also fluctuate in smaller schools because they are a percentage of “filled” open category seats.
 
 The DoE has directed in its circular that the schools must accept income certificates by a competent authority for admission to EWS category, but not if the parents submit BPUAAY or Food Security Card issued by Food and Civil Supply Department. The schools have been directed to update correct admission information status on their web pages by April 15, and allot admissions on the basis of the serial number provided to the candidate at the time of selection.
