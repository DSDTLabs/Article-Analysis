Panaji: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar on Monday invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inaugurate the new Mandovi bridge, which is expected to be complete by April 2018. “Parrikar also briefed Modi on other ongoing infrastructure projects across the state. The duo also briefly discussed the overall political scenario in the country,” the CMO office said. GSIDC sources say that around 72% of the construction work is complete and work to install segments and spans on the south side has just begun.  However, work on the Panaji side will be complete only by the first week of April indicating that the April 2018 deadline given during the monsoon assembly session is unlikely to be met.
