Party posts and honour will come to you automatically if you follow the orders of the party high command,” chief minister   said on Saturday.

 Speaking at the   at Karaipudur near Palladam in Tirupur district, he instructed   leaders to stand united. “Only then can you lead a good government. Some of them tried to disturb the government. However, we defeated them by showing unity,” he said.
 
 Palaniswami blamed DMK for trying to dissolve the government. “This is Amma’s (former chief minister J Jayalalithaa) government and people’s government. I am one among the people. There is no individual chief minister here. All are chief ministers.   will always be our CM,” he said.
 
 The AIADMK leader requested the party cadre to always stand with the party. “After the demise of the party high command Amma, many people were dreaming of dissolving the government. The party cadre should teach them a good lesson,” he said.
 
 The State government would complete the much awaited Avinashi-Athikadavu project within 30 months and would allot Rs 1,516 crore for the project, the CM said. “The project would help farmers of Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode districts. The State government will fulfil the dreams of former CM J Jayalalithaa,” he added. 
 
 An expert committee reviewed the project and suggested to start the project in the Bhavni river at Kalinagarayan canal. “We plan to pump water from Bhavani river for the project,” he added.
