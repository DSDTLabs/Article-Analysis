MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday directed the state government to respond in three weeks to a public interest litigation that urged for scrapping the proposed Shivaji memorial to be built off the city's coast.

 “We want to know the government's stand,“ said the court, while hearing a public interest litigation filed by  , a chartered accountant and owner of a commerce coaching class, which pointed out that “it involves huge expenditure of hard-earned tax-payers' money“. His petition said the Rs 3,600 crore project is nothing but “a political stunt of all the parties operating in Maharashtra“. His advocate   argued that the state has borrowings to the tune of 3.54 lakh crore.
 
 “If you don't have the mo ney, why have such a project?“ he asked. Parikh said at the inauguration around Rs 77 crore was spent. “How lavishly things are going on.The money can be spent on education and for hospitals,“ he added. To the court's query, Parikh replied that the   was built by contribution from people and not the government. The judges questioned what about the people's sentiments towards the memorial. “They are playing with the people's sentiments. The inauguration was done on the eve of the municipal elections," said Parikh.
 
 Bhide's plea said the “public at large is not concerned with building of such memorials“ but want the state “to provide a better standard of living and better public amenities which is the priority of the day“. The plea urged the court to stop “illogical expenditure“.
