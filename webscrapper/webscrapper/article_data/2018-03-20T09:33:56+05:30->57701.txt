HYDERABAD: Cab drivers affiliated with a few associations joined the nationwide oneday taxi drivers’ strike on Monday, staging protests in parts of the city.

 The strike affected cab services in the city only partially with surge pricing being reported from some areas during peak hours.
 
 
 Apart from this, few drivers in support of the strike obstructed other cab drivers and forced them off the roads. But overall, majority of the associations steered clear of the strike.
 
 Protesting drivers demanded that the government come up with its own app (like that of Ola and Uber).
 
 “At present, we have to pay 35% of our earnings to the cab aggregators. Even the incentives have completely dried up. So, we are demanding that the government start an app. Instead of aggregators passing on 5% of our earnings to the government, let the government take 10% from us directly. That way we will still get a benefit of 25%,” said Siddhartha Goud, president, Jai Driver Anna Association of Telangana.
 
 Drivers working with cab aggregators lamented that their profits have dipped as compared to what it was a few years ago due to the lack of incentives. Also, EMIs for their vehicles were cited as the primary reason why cab drivers were unable to make ends meet. The association also demanded free housing and ESI cards for the drivers.
