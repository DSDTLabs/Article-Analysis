GORAKHPUR: Voters of the parliamentary constituency, which led to the rise of   from the mahant of Gorakhnath temple to the chief minister of  , would be looking for someone who has the firebrand leader’s persona and will, say   locals.

 As the district administration gets ready to prepare for the Gorakhpur by-elections on March 14, locals feel it would be a tough job for any one to match up to the persona of Yogi Adityanath, the former MP from the parliamentary constituency.
 
 It’s tough to dismiss the popularity of the five-time member of  , who resigned as a MP last year to take charge as UP CM. Political analysts said the personality of the candidate who will contest the Gorakhpur bypoll will matter given Yogi’s hold over the area.
 
 “Gorakshnath peeth and BJP have strenghtened their hold over the area after Yogi became the chief minister of the state. People have huge hopes from the state and central government. It makes sense to select a person who could take our demands to both the governments,” said Neeraj Srivastava, a city-based writer. Voters are sure to look for someone to replace Yogi, who has a similar persona and can raise his or her voice to take their demands to the Parliament.
 
 Gorakhpur has witnessed 16 Lok Sabha elections in which BJP won sevem times,   six times, Independent candidates have won three times and both Hindu Mahasabha and   have won once each from the parliamentary seat.
 
 However,   and   have never won from the seat.
