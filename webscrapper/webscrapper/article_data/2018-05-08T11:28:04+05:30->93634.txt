GUWAHATI: The rift between the people of Assamese-majority   and Bengali-dominated Barak Valley over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 has become apparent after a meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Committee ( ) here on Monday. 

 The first day of the five-day visit of JPC saw an overwhelming majority of organisations and individuals from the Brahmaputra Valley coming out against the bill. Their contention is that   will be flooded with migrants, especially from Bangladesh, if the bill is passed. Even AGP, an ally of BJP, feels the passage of the bill would put the identity of Assamese people at stake. About 135 organisations, including political parties and individuals, submitted their views during the day-long consultation here.
 
 "The Assam Accord should be the basis on which foreigners should be detected and deported. The bill, if passed, will pose a grave threat to Assamese people. We, as a regional party, will not allow this to happen," said AGP president and agriculture minister Atul Bora after submitting party's memorandum to the JPC.
 
 The bill seeks to fast-track citizenship to religious minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who had to leave their countries of origin because of persecution. It was placed in the Lok Sabha in 2016 but faced opposition, especially from Trinamool Congress MPs. Later, the bill was referred to the JPC to seek views from individuals and organisations.
 
 Former chief minister and AGP MLA Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, who was one of the signatories of Assam Accord signed in 1985 after a six-year-long anti-foreigners' movement, submitted the memorandum separately. Mahanta said the proposed amendment would 'frustrate' the entire process of updating the National Register of Citizens (NRC).
