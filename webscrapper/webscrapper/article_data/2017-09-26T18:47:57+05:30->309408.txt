He told volunteers who were involved in the exercise, “Today this is only one step towards a Clean India, let us every day take a step towards a Clean and   and ensure that our waste is disposed responsibly.”
  
  Parameswaran Iyer, secretary, MoDWS, said, “The campaign saw large-scale mobilization of people from all walks of life to do ‘shramdaan’ (voluntary work) for sanitation. It is great to see so many volunteers coming forward.”
  
  Raghav Langer, director of   initiative and  , added, “After attaining the ODF status, we are now trying to make the state an ODF+ and ODF++ state, under which all kinds of liquid and solid waste is effectively managed. I hope more such campaigns will be held across the state in the months to come.”
