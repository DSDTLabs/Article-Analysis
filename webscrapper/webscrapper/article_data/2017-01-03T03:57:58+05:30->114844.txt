CHENNAI: The Madras high court has directed state election commissioner   to appear before it on January 11 along with documents pertaining to the election of DMK treasurer M K   from the Kolathur assembly constituency in 2011. 

 Justice M   made the ruling when a petition challenging Stalin's election by   came up for hearing. Stalin submitted that the petition could be dismissed as it was not sustainable in law, or on facts. Fresh allegations were submitted at a belated stage to create confusion over the entire trial proceedings conducted so far, Stalin said. 
 
 If accepted, the argument would vitiate the entire basis for free trial. The attitude of the petitioner was "calculated and deliberate to fill the gaps, deficiencies and lacunae in the election petition at the fag end of the trial," he said.
 
 Though he had submitted an eight page "abstract statement of election expenditure", only two pages were available as electronic records on the website, Stalin said. The statement was a mere abstract and not a comprehensive account summary. So the court had to direct authorities to produce the entire account statement. Along with the accounts, the court could ask for the reconciliation order passed by the district electoral officer and the observer for election expenditure. As the ECI had nominated these officials, the court could summon it to produce the documents, said Stalin.
 
 Despite an incomplete election expenditure statement being available in the official website, Duraisamy had accessed the entire eight pages. This created a suspicion of nexus between him and the district electoral officer-the then commissioner of Chennai corporation, said Stalin, calling for a probe.
