CHANDIGARH: Even as a section of truckers decided not to participate in the ongoing wheat procurement, the state government claims to have made adequate arrangements to ensure that the exercise is carried out smoothly. At a meeting of truck operators on Tuesday, it was decided that they would not carry foodgrain unless the prices fixed by the government were not hiked. 

  President of the now dissolved   Truck Operators' Union president   said as per estimates 75% of operations would come to a halt after the decision. Meanwhile, an official said bids had been received from different parts of the state and many truck operators had shown interest in carrying the foodgrain. 
 
 "The tenders are being allotted and the farmers will not face any problem," said the official.
 
 "In the last meeting, it was decided that the truck operators will hold consultations and then arrive at a decision. The common view was that the rates fixed by the government are too low. It is being suspected that the state plans to root out the truckers and being in some other agency," said Sandhu.
 
 The procurement season in Punjab starts from April 1, though crop's arrival in markets (mandis) picks up after Baisakhi festival (April 14).
