GHAZIABAD:   has asked the officials of   Development Authority (GDA) to undertake maintenance works of sewerage lines in   during a public ‘chaupal’ held on Saturday. The chaupal was held near the Windsor Market in Indirapuram in the presence of the MLA and   executive engineer Chakresh Jain.

 The meeting was convened by the Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association (FedAOA) of Ghaziabad following a spat with GDA officials over the lack of maintenance of sewerage lines. Residents alleged that even though the GDA collects crores in sewer and water tax from scores of housing societies, pipelines are not cleaned and remain clogged, resulting in overflowing of sewage on streets.
 
 “GDA has been told to immediately commence maintenance work on sewer lines. A progress report has been sought from GDA after a week. Residents have also alleged that super-sucker machine operators have been demanding bribes for operating the machines. Due course of action will be taken against those demanding bribes,” MLA Sunil Sharma told TOI.
 
 The GDA assured residents that action would be taken in the matter. “We will do the needful to mitigate the problem,” Chakresh Jain said.
