MANGALURU:  , the largest gram panchayat in  , is all set to be upgraded into a   (TMC). A nod given by the state   at its meeting on Saturday, got the process started, that will see this panchayati raj body get upgraded to an urban local body. Spread over 2,063-acres with 6,580 families, the gram panchayat’s estimated revenue collection per annum is Rs 62 lakh, and it receives government grants of up to Rs 1 crore per annum. 

 Averring that Someshwar has all the characteristics of an urban area, R Vishal, director, directorate of municipal administration, told TOI that the cabinet nod is just the first step towards upgrading the gram panchayat to a town municipality. While the normal process is to upgrade a gram panchayat first to a town panchayat and then a town municipality, Vishal said since Someshwar met the population criterion fixed for a TMC, the cabinet has taken the decision to upgrade it accordingly.
 
 “While areas with urban characteristics having a population of 15,000-20,000 are upgraded to a town panchayat, those with a population above 20,000 and up to 50,000 are upgraded to TMC, and areas with a population of above 50,000 up to 3 lakh are categorized as city municipal council. Since Someshwar met the population criterion as per the 2011 Census itself, the government has since taken into account its revenue collection and urban characteristics, to give this in-principle nod,” he said.
 
 “The cabinet nod will now be notified in the state Gazette, and objections called for. Once the process is complete, the government will issue a separate notification upgrading the gram panchayat to a TMC,” Vishal said. At present,   has 61 members and the body was elected 2-1/2 years ago. The residents of the gram panchayat had boycotted GP polls seven years ago, demanding that it be upgraded to a TMC, a demand which the government has now met.
