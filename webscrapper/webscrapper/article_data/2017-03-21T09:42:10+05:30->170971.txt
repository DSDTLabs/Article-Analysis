PUNE: The hill station announced on a 400-hectare   in the district has yet to gain any kind of momentum. 

 The project, to be developed by  , is stuck in the process of obtaining necessary clearances — especially water supply and 18 other permissions.
 
 It was in May last year that the state   issued a notification approving the villages of   and Varak for development, but laid down 19 conditions, one being that they obtain a no-objection certificate from   company to use water from Mulshi dam.
 
 With the hill station project coming under the catchment area of the dam, the state has also demanded an NOC from the environment department about waste water and solid waste. With the onset of summer, the project is likely to be delayed further, feel Aqualand India Limited officials.
 
 Senior Aqualand vice president R P Tyagi said, “We have readied the master plan for the hill station, but are exploring all sources of water supply for the area. We will be requesting Tata company and check the groundwater table with the help of geologists,” said Tyagi.
 
 Apart from residential facilities in the area, the company is keen on a research centre, education hub and tourism development. Apart from the water supply, the company has to obtain permission for electricity and other utilities among others. 
 
 Officials from the Urban Development Department have put the onus of issuing permissions on the   (PMRDA), under whose ambit the region comes.
