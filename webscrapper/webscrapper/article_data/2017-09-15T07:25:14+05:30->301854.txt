 Besides the ambitious bullet train project, Japan PM Shinzo Abe also announced his country’s engagement with Gujarat in developing Smart Cities, green energy, Ahmedabad metro rail, technical education and a string of other projects.
 
 This prompted Modi to applause Abe saying that his (Modi’s) dream of creating a ‘mini Japan’ in Gujarat has finally come true.
 
 "My personal engagement with the leadership, government, industry and people of Japan is now a decade old. When I first visited Japan as chief minister of Gujarat, I had said that...I want to see a mini-Japan in Gujarat. Today, that dream has come true. I am happy to see so many friends from Japan happily living and doing business in Gujarat,’’ Modi said, addressing the plenary session of the Indo-Japan annual meeting at Mahatma Mandir.
 
 Japan was the first country to support Modi’s   summits way back in 2003.
