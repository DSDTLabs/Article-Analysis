Porvorim: Chief minister Manohar   said his statement pertaining to school girls drinking beer was “twisted”. “I never asked anyone to stop drinking. I had only expressed my worry. Even, the interviewer had to tweet that the question was asked in the context of school and  ,” said Parrikar at a cabinet press briefing on Wednesday.

 Clarifying his stand further, Parrikar said he had expressed his “worry” about students drinking and not “fear”. He said, “I can worry even about you people. Some newspaper managements have been sacking newsmen. Shouldn’t I worry? Worry is different from fear. Worry is fundamental to every person.”
 
 Parrikar was trolled online for his statement “even school and college girls drink beer” during an interaction at the   last week. With the former defence minister’s statement going viral, the hastag #girlswhodrinkbeer started trending with women, both young and old, posting photographs with beer bottles in hand.
