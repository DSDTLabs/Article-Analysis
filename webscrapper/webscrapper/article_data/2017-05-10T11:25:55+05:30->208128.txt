KOLHAPUR: A group of unidentified men broke into a house located in   area of Shirol taluka and decamped with valuables worth Rs 4.5 lakh, including Rs 2 lakh cash. 

 The incident has been reported with Jaysingpur police station. According to police, the incident occurred between May 2 and May 8 when the owner of the house - identified as Hussainbadhshah Dastgir   - was away from his home.
 
 According to police, the 38-year-old complainant is a businessman working in fabrication sector and owns a house in Sambhajipur. On May 2, he along with his family members had gone to meet his relatives and returned home only on Monday. Upon his arrival, he found that locks of his house were broken.
 
 "The house was ransacked and when he checked for valuables that he had kept in the cupboard, he found 75 gram   jewellery, 60 gram silver jewellery worth Rs 2.5 lakh and cash Rs 2 lakh were missing," said a police officer.
 
 Mulla immediately lodged a complaint with police in this regard. "The moment we got information about the incident, a team rushed to the spot with a dog squad and finger print expert. We could not get any leads from the dog squad. We suspect that the culprits must have committed crime after realising that the house was locked for more than five days," the policeman said.
 
 He added, "We are gathering information from neighbours if they have spotted anyone roaming around suspiciously in the area. We are also trying to find out if there are any CCTVs and if the culprits were caught in any of the   cameras. We will soon nab the culprits."
