BENGALURU: In what could be seen as an embarrassment to the  , the   ( ) on Friday ordered recall of its three advertisements in electronic media targeting chief minister   and his government.

 
 Acting on a complaint filed by the  , the EC also restrained news channels, social media and other digital platforms from telecasting and broadcasting these ads, while asking the pre-certification committee to reconsider the content of these ads after giving notices to the affected parties within 24 hours.
 
 A three-member committee watched the ads titled, ‘Jana Virodhi Sarakara (anti-people government), Viphala Sarakara (failed government) and Mooru Bhagya (three bhagyas) and found a resemblance between the person shown in them and CM Siddaramaiah.
 
 In these advertisements, the BJP had alleged that the Siddaramaiah government was involved in corruption and plundering public money in implementation of various schemes, including his series of bhagyas schemes. The Congress had termed them defamatory.
 
 Meanwhile, the BJP has taken exception to the EC’s move. “The advertisements were released after taking approval from the pre-certification committee. Now, by recalling them, the EC is acting in a partisan manner,” said state BJP general secretary Shobha Karandlaje.
