NAVI MUMBAI: Neither health nor the transport department want to do anything with the vehicle which was procured with much fanfare by the civic administration to implement the multicrore floating advanced casualty complex ( )or the ‘hospital on wheels’ project.

 After paying around Rs 70 lakh in 2013, the health department had purchased two vehicles to run the emergency medical service. One of the vehicles is a 12m long bus and another a regular ambulance which were to be fitted with emergency equipment for onboard treatment. 
 
 The vehicle has remained stationed within   since then and was recently shifted to the Turbhe bus depot. Over the years the condition of the bus has deteriorated.
 
 “The two vehicles are being put to other use. The smaller vehicle is being used as mobile hospital in rural parts while we have asked NMMT to take over the bigger one,” said the additional civic chief,   (Health). NMMT, however is unsure as it will incur huge expenses.
