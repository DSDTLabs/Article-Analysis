Jaipur: Given the fact that state is home to a large number of monuments and depicts rich culture, Rajasthan deserves a world-class  , believes Vinod Daniel, an expert on museums.

 “The state does not have a world-class museum to showcase its rich heritage. What is required is that a place where heritage, culture and history is all exhibited together, under one roof,’’ said Daniel, who is the chairman of AusHeritage, a network of Australian cultural heritage management organisations. He is also the board member of the International Council of Museums, Paris.
 
 He said that authorities of the state need to appoint a single person, who would dedicatedly work towards developing such a unique collection for display at such a museum. He also pointed out that governance leadership, trained staff and funding are three key points for sustainability of museums. 
 
 “You got to have a director of museum for at least five years. I am seeing a trend of frequent changes in IAS and other officers. In their short tenure, they can’t do much,” he said. 
 
 Daniel emphasised that to tap the rich heritage, there is a need for training programmes such as masters in museology. Moreover, the state can follow Singapore model of museums for better sustainability. He stressed the need for building stories for developing interest of visitors. “Display of artefacts is not enough,’’ he said.
 
 Daniel, an Australian of Indian origin and museum specialist, was in Jaipur on Saturday to talk about ‘Trends in museums: A global perspective’. 
 
 “People in the 16-35 age group do not want to go to the museums. Many western countries have taken measures to get the group back to the museums by organising pub nights. Here (in India), you can’t have that. But, concerts, music and other such events can be organised to appeal to the public,” said Daniel.
