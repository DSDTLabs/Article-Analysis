NEW DELHI: A cover drive remains a cover drive no matter whether it’s Virat Kohli or Mithali Raj smashing the cherry to the fence. For former Australian cricketer and IPL commentator Mel Jones, the basic element of cricket is competition and it doesn’t change with gender. Jones says women’s cricket is equally competitive, skilful and she can’t wait to see women’s IPL happening next year in India.  “I love to see women’s IPL and some of the best players would be in it,” Mel told TOI on Wednesday. Australia are already reaping the benefits of the Women’s Big Bash, which began three years ago. “It got under way three years ago and is already a huge success and gets fantastic support from Cricket Australia. I am sure the women’s IPL would also become a worldwide phenomenon,” she said. One of the powerful voices for women’s cricket in Australia, Jones is all praise for Cricket Australia and the male cricketers. “CA and the players’ association are always working together for a better pay structure. They had discussions last year on how to set a structure for female players. There is a lot of contracts now in state and national levels. Issues like improved central contracts wouldn’t have happened without the support of male players,” Jones said. Jones says that IPL has engineered a lot of change. “This is going to be my fourth year as commentator for IPL. I can say that the tournament is providing a platform for homegrown talent. It is reflected in recent U19 World Cup success and these players were most sought after in the auction.”
