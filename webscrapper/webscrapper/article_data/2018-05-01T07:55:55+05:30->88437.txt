JAIPUR: The state government on Monday withdrew the no objection certificate ( ) issued to the   school in Jaipur for affiliation to the   (CBSE) for violation of the   Schools (Fee Regulation) Act, 2016. 

 The decision will have serious implications on the future of about 2,500 students studying in the school. The order issued by the director, secondary education,  , said the department received many complaints by parents of students regarding unreasonable hike in fees by the school management. The department then ordered an inquiry by the district education officer, secondary, and pointed out the flagrant violations of the rules of Fee Regulation Act, 2016 by the school.
 
 As per the Act the school had to constitute a school level fee committee to decide on the hike in fees, but the school had not followed this rule while hiking the fees. 
 
 The order pointed out that based on the NOC issued by the state government the Central Board of Secondary Education grants affiliation to the school. The school is duty bound to follow the rules and regulations of the state government.
 
 The school was found guilty of not following the rules under the Rajasthan Schools (Fees Regulation) Act 2016 by not constituting the fee committee and also the directions issued by the officials under Rajasthan Non-Governmental Educational Institution Act 1989 and 1993 under section 7(3).
 
 Presently a petition is also pending in the high court by the school challenging the Rajasthan Schools (fees Regulation) Act 2016.
