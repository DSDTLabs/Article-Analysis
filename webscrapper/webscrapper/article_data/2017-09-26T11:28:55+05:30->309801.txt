BENGALURU: Following the steps of some of the districts that made it mandatory for marriage invitation printers to provide the dates of birth of the brides and grooms on the cards, Karnataka is set to implement the same idea in more districts to curb  . 

  The idea was discussed on Monday at a state-level consultation on curbing child marriages. It was organized by World Vision jointly with Karnataka State Commission for  ,  , Bosco and   at Students' Christian Movement of India house. 
 
 Rohini Hiremath, deputy director, child marriage prohibition cell, state women and child development, said, "The idea was discussed by people who are working to put an end to child marriages in Karnataka. Some districts, including Koppal, Raichur and Davanagere have already implemented this. We will ask more districts to follow the same." Though the orders were passed in 2014, it has significantly impacted the rate of child marriages in Koppal, said Harish Jogi, who is looking after the project from the UNICEF in the district.
 
  The order asks printers to verify the age with the help of birth certificate and radiology report besides printing them on the cards. If the printers fail to adhere to the norms, they would face a penalty of Rs 1 lakh and up to two years of imprisonment as per the rules. 
 
  While experts agreed steps have been taken in the right direction to combat this evil, they also admitted more work is needed in rural regions. Lack of basic toilet facilities, lack of education, poverty and fear of leaving a girl child alone at home by working parents were some of the factors attributed to girls being married off early. 
 
  Dr Kripa Amar Alva, chairperson,  , said, "Karnataka accounts for 23.2% of child marriages in the country. The practice is prevalent in almost all districts. We need strong framework of policies to ensure the safety of girl children."
