GURUGRAM: The worst of summer is yet to come but outages are offsetting the little reprieve that the weather has offered in May. They are also forcing residents to run fuel-guzzling generators for hours, which is further worsening the city’s already poor air quality.

 Frequent and prolonged outages have been reported from Sector 56’s Huda market, Sector 14, parts of Palam Vihar and DLF Phase 4 over the past couple of days, making life difficult for residents. 
 
 “The situation is the worst in Huda market. We suffer from outages throughout the day,” said   resident Bhupinder Singh.
 
 “What makes matters worse is when cuts are enforced during the night,” said Manish Yadav, another resident of the area. “It’s impossible to sleep without the AC.”
 
 Sector 14 residents too claimed to be suffering from cuts twice a day at least. “On Wednesday morning, we suffered from a   that lasted more than an hour. And then there was another one in the afternoon. Power discom officials should at least intimate us beforehand so that we can complete our chores accordingly,” said Dinesh Aggarwal, president RWA of Sector 14. “Power cuts in the morning result in no water supply as motors cannot run without electricity to pump enough water to all homes in the locality.”
 
 Yashesh Yadav from Palam Vihar’s Sector 110 A said it was the consumers who were paying the ultimate cost of outages. “It is common for discom to enforce cuts anywhere between 11am and 3pm. We face power cuts at night too. We normally pay Rs 6 per unit of electricity consumed. Once the diesel generator set is turned on, we end up paying Rs 16 per unit.”
 
 No power discom officials was available for comment as they were in a “meeting”.
