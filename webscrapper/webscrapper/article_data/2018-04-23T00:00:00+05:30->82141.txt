In the first trailer of this week’s release, Buckaasuura, the team established that it was an exploration of how people only respect money and would do anything for some moolah. It also gave audiences a sneak peek into the star cast, which includes V Ravichandran, Sithara, Rohitt, Kavya Gowda, Makarand Deshpande, and Sadhu Kokila, among many others, and their characterisations. What made it even more interesting was that the voice over on the trailer was done by Kannada’s Rocking Star, Yash. In the months, thereafter, the film encountered several delays in getting to the big screen. But with a release date now in sight, the team figured that they needed to refresh the audience’s memory and what better way to do that than with a new trailer. “We needed new content to refresh everyone’s memory and get them to go back and check out the first trailer. We had to show them something we hadn’t done before and we thought it best to have audiences see Ravichandran sir’s character and his love for using an ‘f’ word, much of which is beeped out, leaving it up to the viewers’ imagination what he could have said. Since it was Ravi sir’s proper introduction, we needed an actor of a certain stature to do the voice over and who better than namma Hattrick Hero, Shivarajkumar,” says lead actor Rohitt.The gamble has paid off, and Rohitt says that after the second trailer, there has been an increased interest in the first one, which, for him and team Buckaasuura, is a sign of encouragement.
