 The Congress continued to maintain that a decision on an alliance with Goa Forward Party and United Goans Party had yet to be taken and that a clear picture would emerge on January 17 after the visit of AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh.
 
 NCP had demanded four seats but after the exit of two of its main candidates, the party had hoped to bag Vasco and Benaulim for party president Jose Philip D’Souza and Churchill Alemao respectively. With Congress announcing that Saifulla Khan and Edwin Barretto would contest the polls from Vasco and Benaulim respectively, a strong message appears to be sent.
 
 “The door is shut now for NCP,” said AICC secretary Girish Chodankar while confirming the seven candidates.
