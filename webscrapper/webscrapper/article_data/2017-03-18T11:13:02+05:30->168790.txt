COIMBATORE: Around 10 vehicle owners have filed a police complaint against a city-based  , accusing him of not paying rent for the vehicles and also for damaging them.

 The owners said that they had rented around 22 cars to Kalidas, a cab operator based in   in October. “He had promised to pay rent for the vehicles every month and also take care of the vehicles’ maintenance during the rent period,” said the main complainant, S  , a resident of Tatabad in  . “We trusted him because he said he plans to expand the operation,” he said.
 
 Kalidas paid the rent only for one month, the complainant said. “We received rent for the month of November. When we demanded the rent for the rest of the months, he said he would pay up with the arrears soon. By February, he stopped picking up our calls and coming to the office,” he said.
 
 Fed up with the situation, the owners reached the cab operator’s office early this month. “We met each other at the office,” said Venkatraman. He said he had rented out five cars to Kalidas, including four Tata Indica and a Chevrolet Beat. “We grabbed the keys of our cars from the front office. To our shock, we found that the cars had no engines, music players, speakers, GPS systems and fare metres. Brand new tyres were replaced with damaged ones,” said Venkatraman.
 
 “Now the man is absconding and not reachable. We want our rent arrears cleared and the damages paid for,” he added.
