THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A fact-finding team, headed by National Human Rights Commission member and former chief justice of J&K high court BC Patel, said that the ruling   was responsible for perpetrating violence and political killings in Kannur.

 Addressing a news conference on Saturday, Patel said his team could trace the active role of CPM-led governments for political killings in the northern district. Over the years, the district had witnessed a series of political killings.
 
 The team appointed by Call for Justice, a Delhi-based NGO, has submitted its report to the President and governor to issue recommendations to ensure that justice is meted out to the victims of political violence.
 
 
 “Killings and counter killings have become the order of the day in Kannur since Sangh Parivar started carving a space in communist bastions. Such killings peak when CPM is in power and all investigations turned out to be farce,” said the report.
 
 
 The report pointed out that the judge who awarded capital punishment to KT Jayakrishnan’s murderers had to face threats to his life and was given police protection. The team suggested that the state government should hand over political killing cases to independent investigating agencies such as NIA or  .
 
 
 “State government should come forward to protect the civil rights of citizens. Political parties which abet violence and protect criminals should be sued and compensation for the victims should be collected from them,” the report said.
 
 
 Apart from BC Patel, the members of the fact-finding team were retired high court judge Suresh Soni (former Lokayukta of Gujarat), former director of AIIMS TD Dogra, deputy advocate general, Chhattisgarh Gopakumar Pillai and managing secretary, Call for Justice, Ravi Harjai.
