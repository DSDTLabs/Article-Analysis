Korea Tourism Organization, in association with regional tourism boards of Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi, organized its   (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Events) Roadshow where exhibitors from   came forward to interact with the stakeholders of Indian travel trade. As the purpose of the event was, 'Korea Beyond Boundaries,' a non-verbal performance by a Korean troupe impressed everyone with the drawing of   that was made using charcoal within 15 minutes by the artists. 

  
 Meuitee, Kimjanty and Leenayoung, artists from Korea came for the non-verbal performance called 'The Drawing Room' for the show. To make the performance interesting, the artists danced and made funny poses for the audience. The first drawing made by the artists was a night scene. "The next drawing was of a waterfall. The best part of the painting comes in the end, when the water seems to be flowing in the painting. It is a secret how the water appears to be flowing in the end," said Meuitee. 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 The next and last section of the performance was the most interesting part. The artists drew the Taj Mahal in 15 minutes using charcoal. "The last drawing was all about speed. We slowly draw the first part and then as the music in the background gets faster, we increase our speed. When we go abroad,we can change the content of the drawing, we can also draw famous personalities in this section of our performance. Since we came to India, we chose to draw the Taj Mahal. After we finished the drawing, we used lights to enhance the beauty of it," said Kimjanty from the group.
