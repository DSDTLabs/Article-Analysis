At the moment it is fine margins for United… they can finish in the top 4… outside the top 4 will be a disaster.
 
 
 
 It was a slow start for Mourinho but in the last 3-4 months he has shown what a great manager he is. The problem is that in spite of such a great 3-4 months, they have not made much progress because competition this year is so tight and tough. Arsenal and Liverpool are going through a rough spell right now but Tottenham like Manchester City have been consistent and only Chelsea have been consistent all through. It’s difficult for a top team United because there are six great teams fighting for a top 4 berth.
 
 
 
 You can’t do a lot about it because of television right and sponsors — after all it’s the No. 1 sport in the world. It’s how you spend that money that matters. If you can afford to buy Pogba for $90 million that’s great but in place like China you can get great players but you also need that infrastructure. Money has to be spent in the right way.
