 Central Board of Secondary Education students, who are waiting for their results, are also trying their luck in DU. 
 
 Akshita Singh of Radiant International School said, “I hope to get above 90% in Class XII. I have already applied for DU and am waiting for the admission forms of   and Jawaharlal Nehru University.”
