NAGPUR: Even as the   (NMC) is ready to allocate 148   in 5 of the 52 hawking zones across the city in the first phase, it will not ease congestion at these places. Reason: during a survey of these areas, the   found around 400 hawkers as against 148 who have registered their hawking businesses with the civic body.

 A senior official from the NMC’s market department said the locations where hawkers will be accommodated include North Ambazari road (in front of Matru Seva Sangh Hospital), right side patch between Model Mill Chowk and Jadhav Chowk, Ganeshpeth ST Bus stand chowk corner, along the compound wall of Mayo Hospital (in front of Chandralok Building) and Kalpana Talkies (near MSEB Office, Mankapur).
 
 The situation is out of control at Rani Jhansi square where the vendors have encroached on footpaths hardly leaving any space for pedestrians. The compound wall of Matru Seva Sangh too is being used by these hawkers to display products. The fact that the vendors return to business immediately after the anti-encroachment drive proves that they escape action by bribing the officials, sources said.
 
 Similar is the situation in other areas. To regularize them, the NMC had a launched registration drive for hawkers to accommodate them in hawking zones. It had also carried out surveys of all areas, including above five zones.
 
 As per the department’s survey, it found over 200 hawkers engaged in hawking on North Ambazari road near Rani Jhansi Square. However, when it conducted the registration drive, only 90 hawkers came forward. So was the case in other areas. The menace of hawkers has increased manifold outside ST stand in Ganespeth area. Here too, only 19 hawkers have registered themselves for hawking zones.
 
 The NMC will accommodate 148 hawkers in these five places through lottery draw system, the officer said. To a query, he clarified that non-registered hawkers will not be allowed to do business in the designated areas.
