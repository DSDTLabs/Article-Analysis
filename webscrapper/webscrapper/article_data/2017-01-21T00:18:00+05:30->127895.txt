Bhopal: A two-member team of the Madhya Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad has been dispatched to Bihar for investigation into claims made by the recently arrested ISI module about plots to carry out serial blasts in cities like Indore.

 Bihar police had on Tuesday arrested three people -- Moti Paswan, Uma Shankar and Mukesh Yadav -- from Raxaul, bordering Nepal. Suspected to be part of an international gang with links to Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), the trio have so far confessed that they had tried to blow up a railway track at Ghorasahan in East Champaran district on October 1, 2016, said sources.
 
 R&AW and National Intelligence Agency sleuths are now interrogating them in connection with the November 20 Indore-Patna Express mishap in Kanpur that claimed 150 lives, among other train accidents.
 
 The accused have revealed that ISI had plans to carry out serial train blasts at Indore and Delhi. “There are some positive leads on the Indore-Patna Express derailment in Kanpur, but whether they really had an ISI linkage and were part of larger conspiracy to carry out terror strikes at Indore is yet to be ascertained,” said a police officer, confirming that a MP ATS team has been dispatched.. “If required, the trio would be brought to MP on transit remand,” said the officer. 
 
 It is also suspected that these three accused are directly associated with a senior ISI operative who is of Nepalese origin. “MP is on this person’s radar,” said the officer.
