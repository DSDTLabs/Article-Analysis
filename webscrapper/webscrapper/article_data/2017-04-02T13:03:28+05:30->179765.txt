COIMBATORE: A 20-year-old   was   from a   located near   at   in   on Saturday. The elephant that had come to drink water on early morning was stuck in slush.

 Locals informed the forest officials. They said that the animal must have come to drink water. A calf, which seemed to be less than a year old, was also spotted along with the jumbo. The calf did not leave the mother’s side during the entire process.
 
 Forest officials said that they reached the spot around 9.45 am. “The elephant did not have any external injuries. It was in a state of shock and was tired. Veterinarian Manoharan Sadiyappan treated the elephant with injections and medicines. We have also asked the officers to give a hot water bath in order to improve its blood circulation,” district forest officer, S Ramasubramanian said.
 
 Fifty bottles of saline was given to the elephant. Its dung had a lot of parasites indicating the presence of intestinal infection. “We gave some anti-helmintic tablets, vitamin supplements, pain killers and green fodder, banana plant fruits and stems was also fed to the elephant. Though its condition slowly improved, it was unable to get up on its own. We used a ramp-like structure and an earthmover to help the elephant stand on its feet,” a forest officer said.
 
 As soon as it got up, it went into the forest followed by its calf. “The elephant was a lactating mother and when we were feeding the elephant, the calf was also feeding milk from the elephant. So we are glad that we saved both the mother and calf,” an official said.
