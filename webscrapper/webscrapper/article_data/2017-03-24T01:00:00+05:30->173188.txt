Manoj Bajpayee, who will soon be seen in ' ' and 'Sarkar 3', had a year of reunions. First, he mended fences with his mentor and best friend, director  , and then, he worked with   in ' ', after a gap of more than 15 years.

  When asked about reuniting with Ramu, the actor, who had picked a very public fight with the filmmaker, says, “Ramu was making films all along. It’s just that we didn’t work together. We fought like children. We had our share of disagreements, but in full public view. Later, I kicked myself for doing that. He’s the one who kicked off my acting career in films. He’s my mentor and like a big brother. I realised my mistake. So, when we finally met on the sets of 'Sarkar 3', it was like starting from where we had left off. Like always, we started with a glass of wine.We had our drinks and then shot the first scene.”
 
 In the same year, Manoj, who had previously worked with Tabu in two films, 'Ghaath' and 'Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar', collaborated with her on a project that he is also producing. We wonder whether wine was on the scene when they reunited as well. “No wine there, please! Tabu is very boring. She doesn’t drink,” laughs Manoj, adding, “We were shooting in Mauritius. So, I ensured that my friend is well looked after, has the best room and has no one bothering her. Over these years, Tabu hasn’t changed one bit. I’m lucky she likes me and is a fantastic friend, because if she doesn’t like you, she makes it very evident.”
