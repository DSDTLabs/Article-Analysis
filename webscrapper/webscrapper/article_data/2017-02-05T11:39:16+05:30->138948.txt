LUCKNOW: After studying CCTV footage, crime branch officials of the city police on Saturday claimed assailants who shot trader Shravan Sahu on Wednesday might have been from outside Lucknow. 

 Officials said CCTV footage showed a biker helping shooters identify Sahu. The footage also showed miscreants lurking near a shop where Sahu used to visit regularly. Shooters gunned him down in 12 seconds and sped off the scene unchallenged. 
 
  police station officer Samar Yadav said, “We will enhance CCTV footages to identify the shooters. Two teams have been constituted to scan the entire area where the incident took place. They will try to find out if CCTV cameras installed in other public or private places have captured the shooters too. 
 
 ASP (crime)   said, “We are checking the call detailed record of Shravan and some members of Munna Bajrangi gang have also been detained for questioning.”
 
 Late Saturday night, a police team raided the Lucknow jail premises and interrogated several criminals in connection with the case.
 
 Shravan had accused he had been framed by his arch rival Aueel in connivance with Crime Branch sleuths and constables posted at Para police station, who were later suspended.
