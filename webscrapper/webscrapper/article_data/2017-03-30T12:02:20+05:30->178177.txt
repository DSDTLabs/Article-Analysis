Hello, summer. Get ready for long days, clear skies and a lot of sun.   during the hot days is very important. Here are a few   essentials we hope you are ready with for the days up ahead... 

 
 
 
 Be it a tee, top, shorts or swimwear, stripes is here to make your summer cooler. Be it horizontal or vertical, the classy nautical, or in bold hues to super skinny ones, make sure you have at least one of them. 
 
 
 
 Phone, keys, makeup kit, glasses, scarf, books, tissues, pens, and almost the entire world. Get those big totes that can fit in almost anything. They are cool, casual and are meant for the heat. Flaunt them!
 
 
 
 This accessory will give you that extra oomph that you need to beat the heat. A plain kurta, heavily embroided scarf and glasses will give you the chic look. 
 
 
 
 Stripped jeans, an over-sized tee, chunky chains and flip flops. Do we have to say more? Bright-coloured and comfortable, get a pair and it will match with almost anything! 
 
 
 
 Wake those over-sized T-shirts from slumber and bring them out. Comfy and easy, these tees let your skin breathe and are up on the style game. Floral, stripes, patterns or just plain, tees are the best thing that will happen to you this summer. 
 
 
 
 Yellow is the new black! From tops, dresses and T-shirts, bright yellow-coloured clothes are clearly here to stay. Pair those   with   and you are sure to nail the look. Try out different shades of the colour, too.
