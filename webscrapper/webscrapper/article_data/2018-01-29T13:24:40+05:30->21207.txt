HUBBALLI: Upset over the delay on the part of a sugar factory in  , a farmer in Kakur Tanda,   district, set   on his 2 acres of land on fire on Sunday.

 Prakash   poured kerosene on his sugarcane crop and set it on fire. The farmer said that he grew the crop on 6 acres of land. “I will wait for 2-3 days. If the factory failed to visit my field (for crushing sugarcane), I will burn the remaining crop,” he said.
