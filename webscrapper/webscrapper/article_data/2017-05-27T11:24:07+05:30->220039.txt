PUNE:   leader   on Friday said the   government at the Centre had failed to fulfil its promises in the past three years and came up with anti-people policies, yet hardly anyone was raising voice against it.

 He said, “There is no mass agitation against this government despite many scams and corruption cases because of the fear prevailing in the nation. During the Congress regime, there were various mass agitations against the government. But today the government is using the CBI and the enforcement directorate to quell the voice of Opposition.”
 
 Ramesh said generation of two crore jobs every year and 50% profit over the cost of agriculture production as the minimum support price (MSP) were the two big false promises Modi had made to the people of India. “The government is repackaging old Congress schemes with new names. We must admit that we failed to promote our own schemes and projects,” he said.
 
 Claiming that even ministers in the Union cabinet were working under fear, he said, “In the past three years, the Prime Minister hardly had any dialogue with the Opposition. He wants to run the show on his own. Modi is banking on branding and marketing.”
 
 Ramesh stressed though the Congress faced a major challenge, nobody should write it off. He said the next two years would be the “migratory” period for many leaders. “These things happen in politics. We have to keep patience and fight our battle,” he said, refusing to answer any questions regarding the change in guard in the Congress.
