CHENNAI: Children have fundamental and basic human rights to enjoy their childhood with joy and enthusiasm, without stress, the Madras   has said while directing the Centre to ensure that private   schools follow only   prescribed syllabus and not to give homework to children up to Class II.

 
 Observing that children aren’t weight-lifters, and school bags aren’t loaded containers, Justice N Kirubakaran said, “Children should not be overburdened with many subjects; they are entitled to minimum sleeping hours as per their age which is a fundamental right as per Article 21 of the Constitution. Deprivation of required sleep would affect children mentally and physically, causing adverse effects, and they should not be allowed/made to hold pencils till they become five years old.”
 
 Children are also entitled to a conducive learning environment, to study without stress or trauma. Home work given to Class I and Class II students would put pressure on them and affect their sleeping time. Compulsion to read non-prescribed books which are not age appropriate would have adverse effects on young minds. Children should not be made to carry heavy school bags at the risk of their health, the judge added.
 
  The court made the observations on a plea moved by advocate M Purushothaman seeking a direction to CBSE schools to follow only syllabus prescribed by NCERT. 
 
 When the plea came up for hearing, Justice Kirubakaran said, “The innocence of children is being robbed by ambitious parents, taskmaster teachers and result-oriented schools by prescribing irrelevant books at a very young age. Children end up rote memorising which does not help the children or the parents. The system only does destruction of younger minds.” The directions have to be implemented from the academic year 2018-19.
