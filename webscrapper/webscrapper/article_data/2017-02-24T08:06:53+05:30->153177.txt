KOCHI: Online taxi drivers working with Uber and Ola have called a   on Monday protesting   of the  . The strike, which will start on Sunday midnight will continue till Monday midnight. 

 Around 7,000 online taxies will keep off the road. They have called for a strike raising several demands. Shajo Jose, general secretary of the   said: "The strike is against the exploitation of drivers by the companies. Earlier, for every Rs 1,000 earned, we received an incentive of Rs 500. But now that has been reduced to Rs 100. The companies continue to register new vehicles and drivers every day and as a result we fail to get more trips. The supply is more than the demand".
 
 "We buy cars by taking large loans. With the number of trips getting fewer and our incentives getting reduced, we find it difficult to pay back the loan. Initially, these companies offered us attractive returns. Now our future looks bleak," said a taxi driver.
 
 Among the demands raised by the association are: Halt registration of new taxis, treat drivers as employees, request for taxi service should made to the proportion of one taxi for 20 trips, introducing customer care service in Malayalam, implementing uniform fare system and that trip fare should be calculated from the service accepting point instead of calculating the fare from where the customer gets into the vehicle.
 
 The decision to observe the strike was taken at a meeting convened on Wednesday in Kochi. A driver said when new vehicles are added to the service, the companies control the trips in favour of the new ones, leaving old vehicles in the lurch. One taxi aggregator has added 15,000 new taxies in the state so far. 
 
 The association has also demanded that trip controlling by the companies needs to be stopped, trips of more than 15km must be considered as two trips and that drivers should not be forced to offer services during peak time.
