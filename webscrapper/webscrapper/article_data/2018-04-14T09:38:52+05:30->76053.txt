LUCKNOW: Gomti Riverfront, which has seen no further construction activity for the last one year since getting mired in controversies and multiple probes, may soon get a makeover, courtesy  . 

 After the government asked it to pitch in with suggestions on how the riverfront can be turned clean and green,   this week submitted a preliminary project report to the nodal agency - irrigation department - on how to breathe life into  . 
 
 LDA has proposed complete landscaping afresh as earlier plants have perished and weeds have taken over all the green space. LDA has suggested Gomti's revival in three steps -  , developing greenery and deploying an agency for round-the-clock maintenance and security. All three measures will be taken along the identified stretch of 8.3 km from Hanuman Setu temple to the rubber dam. LDA has pegged the cost of its project at around Rs 27 crore. LDA vice chairman Prabhu N Singh told TOI, "If the government approves the project report, the landscaping and development of greenery will take about six months after the tender process. We hope to make the banks cleaner and greener by 2018-end." Currently, the entire stretch is in a   with trash piles, broken tiles, damaged fountains and defunct lights dotting the entire stretch. The river has also turned dirtier with no check on garbage dumping and several drains still discharging sewage directly into it. 
 
 An official involved in the project told TOI, "All the plants have dried up. We need to start plantation afresh, develop gardens, plant exotic trees to beautify the banks. We will also rope in an agency to ensure safety of people visiting the riverfront. If we are allotted the project work, we shall be able to complete it by December 2018 after which complete riverfront can be handed over for public use."
