Trichy: A 24-year-old man was arrested for assaulting a government doctor at the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) here in the late hours of Thursday. 

 The accused was identified as M Karthikeyan from Andhanallur near Geeyapuram. 
 
 The doctor, identified as Suresh and a native of Avaniapuram in Namakkal district was a casualty medical officer on duty from 7pm on Thursday to 7am on Friday.
 
 According to his complaint, Karthikeyan’s wife was admitted in the hospital for treatment. The doctor said that Karthikeyan visited his wife at 8.45pm on Thursday under the influence of alcohol and shouted and verbally abused her. His verbal onslaught led to a noisy situation in the casualty ward on the ground floor of the super speciality block. 
 
 As Suresh was the duty doctor at that time, he intervened and asked Karthikeyan to maintain silence. This infuriated the inebriated Karthikeyan. He then turned his ire on the doctor and started abusing him in obscene language, the doctor alleged. 
 
 While the doctor tried to prevent his abuses, Karthikeyan allegedly punched the former’s hands and threatened him with dire consequences. Acting on the doctor’s complaint, the government hospital police arrested Karthikeyan. He was remanded in judicial custody.
