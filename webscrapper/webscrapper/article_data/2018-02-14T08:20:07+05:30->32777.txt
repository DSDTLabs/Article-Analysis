JAIPUR:   is back with   as the mentor. The Jaipur-based franchise’s management made the announcement on Tuesday. TOI had earlier reported that the Australian spin legend, who was the Royals skipper in the inaugural edition of the  , which they had won, was expected to be back with Royals as the mentor. Warne's recent tweet hinted that he was in talks for a possible return to the IPL.

 
 “I am very happy and excited to be back with the Rajasthan Royals who I believe hold a very special place in my cricketing journey,” Warne said in a statement on Tuesday. “I am overwhelmed by the love and affection showered on me by the franchise and fans of Rajasthan Royals.”
 
 With Warne as the mentor, he is expected to call the shots and the Royals are unlikely to invest in a strong coach. He is in fact, more likely to depend on Royals' cricket in-charge Zubin Bharucha. Warne and Bharucha had worked in tandem to spot talent for the Royals in the initial years. Warne might well want one of his trusted aids as the coach, someone he has worked with and who understands his methods. “We have always looked to groom talents at Rajasthan Royals and it will be no different this time,” Bharucha said.
 
 Warne led the Royals for three years, playing in 52 matches. The success of the first year, however, could not be repeated in the next two seasons under Warne.
 
 Co-owner Manoj Badale hoped that bringing back Warne would also help Royals recover their lost ground, returning after serving out a two-year ban. The ghosts of spot-fixing and betting have dented Royals' image considerably and they would need a strong performance to regain the trust of their fans.
