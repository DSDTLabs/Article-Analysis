NAGPUR: The 19-year-old survivor, rescued by   on Saturday from  , around 50km from Nagpur, had been handed over to Vinod Jadhav by a kin around a month ago requesting him shelter her some time before he could get contacts of her family in   in Madhya Pradesh. 

 Jadhav, remanded to police custody till July 26 on Sunday by a court, started exploiting her apart from trying to contact a network of traffickers who is learnt to be part of the racket who sells women for marriages. 
 
 It was a close relative of Jadhav who had ensured the cops receive the input about him keeping the young woman in captivity. Police said that the survivor was spotted by a passer-by while loitering around the highway. He had rescued the girl before handing her over to a kin of Jadhav. Sources in the police station said Jadhav would take the girl to his farm where he would exploit her repeatedly. As the survivor had tried to escape several times and also threaten the family to expose them, Jadhav started keeping her tied to a pole in the house. 
 
 According to API Yogesh Pardhi, Jadhav had started conspiring to sell off the survivor when she was rescued. “Two more names, including that of a woman, have come to fore. One of the suspects is learnt to be involved in the trafficking racket too. There could be more arrests made in the case soon who were trying to finalize deals to sell off the girl,” he said. 
 
 It was also learnt that police had sent teams to Seoni in MP to trace the village of the survivor. “We are finding it difficult to trace the relatives of the survivor,” he said.
