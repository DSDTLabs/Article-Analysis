MANGALURU: A   in the middle of the road and not finding a   nearby or the service too costly? This   'Autocurador' designed by the  , Surathkal, makes your car service experience hassle-free. Launched in March, Autocurador is functioning in Mangaluru, Hyderabad and soon, will be functional in Vizag. 

 The startup is the brainchild of Godana Dilip, a mechanical engineering graduate and he is joined by Bharath Kumar Gunda, Rakesh Nagasai Katakam and Gopishetty Sai Charan Ankith. "In case of any four-wheeler related services, a car owner can just log in to the app and find nearby semi-branded service stations that offer an array of vehicle care," explains Dilip.
 
 When asked about the idea behind starting the app, he said, "A personal experience that happened a year ago was the reason. We had gone on a long drive, when a bike parked on the road fell on our vehicle and resulted in a dent in our SUV. "We approached that car showroom and they quoted a hefty price to clear the dent, which could have be done outside for a lower price. This incident gave me the idea to design an app that can help four-wheeler owners and come handy during such situations."
 
 The app has more than 10 services available for a user. Autocurador offers a wide range of services for a car, right from wash to engine servicing through a network of service stations in that particular locality where the customer wants to book the service from and it does offer breakdown services. The best part is that it also offers pick up and drop facility.
 
 The app also acts as a comparison platform for the services provided by different service stations in the same locality. And the pricing starts from as low as Rs 49. 
 
 As of now, they have tied up with seven service stations in Mangaluru and 10 service stations in Hyderabad.
 
  Services available include: washing, general service, wheel care, breakdown services, painting, emission and others.
