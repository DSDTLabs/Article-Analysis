Thane: The transport undertaking in Thane has decided to discontinue the   between   junction and   citing operational losses. The decision was taken at the transport committee meeting on Friday where the municipal transport administration said the buses had failed to attract adequate passengers making it loss making. Barely ten passengers used the facility daily and earned barely Rs 1,200 while the operating cost of the   buses was around Rs 5,000. 

 Officials from the TMT said the buses often used to take more than two hours to reach their destinations thanks to the massive traffic snarls in Mumbai on the EEH and beyond. Passengers initially used the services, but later the numbers dropped, making it ineffective. We used the freeway and even the JJ flyover but still there was no respite from the snarls, making trips loss making, said an official. 
 
 It may be recalled the route number 144 was started after the BEST bus trips on the same route was shut few months back. Passengers and elected representatives had pushed for the service saying it would bring in revenue to the corporation coffers. The TMT had deployed only bus service each during the morning and evening peak hours but even they failed to attract commuters forcing the administration to rethink operating the trips. The buses could have been proved to be a good alternative to the crammed railway services and helped reduce the number of private cars to an extent but to no use, lamented officials.
