PATNA: A day after   leader   surrendered, a local court here sent him to judicial custody for 14 days on Thursday. "After being produced in a local court here, Manoj   was sent to jail," said a police official.
 
 Baitha, who was absconding after his vehicle was allegedly involved in an accident that killed nine school children on Saturday in Muzaffarpur, surrendered before the police on Wednesday.
 
 Baitha was shifted to   and Hospital (PMCH) for treatment of his injuries sustained in the accident. The BJP had suspended Baitha from the party for six years following the opposition's hue and cry over the issue.
 
 Early this week the RJD had also threatened to launch a protest in the state if the   (BJP) leader was not arrested. The police said that Baitha was in the vehicle at the time of the accident, but he along with his driver fled and went into hiding.
 
 A FIR was lodged on Monday against Baitha on the statement of Mohammad Ansari, whose five grandchildren were killed in the accident. The accident occurred near   school on NH 77 on Saturday when a SUV hit the children while they were crossing the road.
