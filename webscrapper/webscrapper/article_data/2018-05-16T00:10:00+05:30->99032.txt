Malappuram: With the Ramzan moon being not sighted on Tuesday, Muslims in state will start   on Thursday. A decision in this regard was taken after different qasis confirmed that they did not sight the crescent from anywhere in the state.

 The qasis included Panakkad Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal, Kozhikode qasi K V Imbichahammed, Samastha Kerala Jammiyyathul Ulama president Syed Mohammed Jifri Muthukkoya Thangal, Samastha general secretary K Alikutty Musliyar, All India Sunni Jamiyyathul Ulama general secretary Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musliyar and Syed Ibrahim Khaleelul Bukhari.
 
 Mujahid factions and Jamaate Islami will also commence Ramzan fasting on Thursday.
 
 The qasis, while announcing the beginning of Ramzan, exhorted the believers to respect the sanctity of the month by engaging in prayers and extending a helping hand to the destitute.
 
 They urged the Muslim community to keep away from activities and extravagance which denigrate the spirit of the holy month and actively engage in charity that would benefit the financially backward people in society.
 
 The mosques and Islamic institutions have chalked out month-long spiritual programmes, including spiritual discourses and study classes, across the state during the holy month of fasting for Muslims. Most hotels run by the members of the community will remain closed during the day for a month.
