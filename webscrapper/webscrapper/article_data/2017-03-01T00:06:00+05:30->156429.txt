INDORE: Despite rise in air pollutant emissions due to increase in number of vehicles in Indore, transport department does not have adequate number of   ( ) centres to keep a check on it. 

 There are 58 PUC centres in the city for checking vehicles exhaust emission based pollution, however as per the norms of   (NGT), at least 300 centres are required for it. 
 
 There are more than 17 lakh two-wheelers and four-wheelers in the city and around 300 vehicles are registered with the department daily. However, the department issue authorisations to private operators due to which the number of PUC certificates issued or renewed daily is not known. 
 
 Transport authorities have also been instructed to ensure that the vehicles plying in Indore adhere to pollution control norms and procure compulsory PUC certificate. They were also directed to install PUC machines at more than 240 fuel stations of the city to check vehicles, but no efforts has been made so far in this regard. 
 
 The transport department, which is an enforcement body, has not conducted any exclusive drive to check PUC certification for past many months. Acquiring a PUC certificate from a centre has become a cake walk. Even if measurements are beyond prescribed levels, the   allegedly issue certificates.
 
 However, transport officials have a different say. They said vehicle check drives were started from time to time. “Challans were issued during vehicle check drives. But, due to lack of enforcement personnel, we are unable to keep a check on violators,” said regional transport officer MP Singh. 
 
 As per the government regulations, any holder of a diploma in auto or mechanical engineering is eligible to conduct the PUC test and run a centre. The PUC centre is also expected to have an annual maintenance contract in place so as to ensure that instrument calibration is updated at all times.
