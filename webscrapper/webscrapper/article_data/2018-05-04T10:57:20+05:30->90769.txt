CHENNAI:  , senior advocate and wife of former Union minister  , has appealed against a single judge order refusing to dispense with her personal appearance before Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the scam involving Kolkata-based Saradha Chit Fund .

 
 A bench of Justices V Bharathidasan and N   initially said they were not inclined to hear the appeal, but later agreed to hear the matter on Friday, if time permitted.
 
 The issue pertains to summons issued by the ED directing Nalini’s appearance in person as a witness in the chit fund scam. Aggrieved, she moved the high court saying as per Section 160, women and children could not be summoned outside their place of residence for any inquiry. However, a single judge dismissed her plea, saying Nalini could not seek absolute exemption citing Section 160. “The court expects that senior advocates do not shy away from cooperating in investigation of offences committed under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,” the single judge said.
 
 On April 30, as directed by the court, the ED summoned her to Kolkata. The bench observed that when such appearance is mandated by  , then the petitioner must appear.
