It had also directed the investigating officer to produce Krishnadas before the jurisdictional magistrate, to be released on bail, when he surrendered for questioning.

 Meanwhile, Wadakkanchery judicial first class magistrate Sreedevi posted the bail applications of Krishnadas and three others ­ administrative manager Sukumaran, physical education teacher Govindankutty and administrative executive Valsalakumar ­ for orders on Wednesday. However, the magistrate granted conditional bail to legal adviser Suchithra.
 
 The counsel for the accused argued that police had only slapped bailable offences against them when they were arrested but later added non-bailable offences.They contended that the police wanted to divert attention from the media criticism of the probe into Jishnu death case.
 
 Prosecutor T R Manoj Kumar argued that preparing the FIR marks only the commencement of an investigation and new penal sections could be added during the progress of the investigation. Suchithra's counsel contended that her name did not figure in the FIR and section 437 of CrPC calls for special consideration for women in bail application.
