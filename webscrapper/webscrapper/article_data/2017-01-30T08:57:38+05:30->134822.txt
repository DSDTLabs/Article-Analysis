Apart from the search operations undertaken across the district and informing the police of the neighbouring city or district about missing persons, we visit the residences of the complainants or call them on their cellphones to check whether the kidnapped person has returned home or if he/she is in contact with them.”
 
 The police also said that the maximum number of girls or boys who go missing are the ones in the age group of 13 years to 18 years.
