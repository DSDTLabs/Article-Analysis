BENGALURU: The  , which on Saturday issued draft regulations amending the   (Classifications and Registrations) Rules, 1997, has said there will be a no-refund policy for new school registrations even if an application is denied.

 Many   believe this will put an end to shoddy document submission and fraudulent businessmen opening schools.
 
 Under the new rules, the department has issued fee structures for setting up of new schools or classes and said the enrolment of schools will be through an online process, which could be done using the departmentâ€™s IT portal sts.karnataka.gov.in by November 30 every year.
 
 The department has notified the fee as Rs 50,000 for setting up a primary institution (Class 1-7); Rs 1 lakh for classes 8-10 and Rs 1,25,000 for classes 11 and 12. For preprimary schools, the registration and processing fee together will amount to Rs 15,000 in BBMP areas, Rs 7,500 in urban areas other than   and Rs 2,500 in rural areas.
 
 Strict adherence to the Student Achievement Tracking System (SATS) has been mandated by the department. Schools must put up details of student enrolment and teaching resources on the portal.
