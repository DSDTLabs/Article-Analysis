Pune: Illegal constructions are likely to be curbed in the merged villages as the development control rules for the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) areas will be enforced in the newly added 11 hamlets.  “The state has issued a notification, directing the civic administration to implement the existing development control (DC) rules in its extended limits,” a PMC official said. “The merger was done last year but construction work continued unchecked. We will now be able to keep an eye on the constructions, especially the illegal ones,” the official added. The government had planned to merge 34 villages in the PMC limits. In 2017, it decided to merge the villages in phases. Accordingly, 11 fringe villages were merged first. Uruli Devachi and Phursungi have been merged totally and nine villages partially.  A Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) estimate states that the merged villages have over 5,000 illegal constructions. On the other hand, a PMC estimate states that over Rs 2,229 crore will be needed for infrastructure development in the newly added villages.  “The civic administration will be able to streamline development in these villages. A dedicated development plan for the newly merged villages will be drafted in the days to come. For the time being, the existing DC rules of PMC will be in place. It will form the guidelines for the civic administration and developers in these villages,” city engineer (PMC) Prashant Waghmare said.  “The step to enforce the DC rules in the merged villages is good. But the move should not remain on paper.,” said Shriang Chavan of citizens’ group Haveli Taluka Nagari Kruti Samiti.  The group had filed a petition in the high court on the merger of villages.
