AHMEDABAD: A Haryana resident has filed a complaint with   police against a Chandlodia-based doctor for cheating and breach of trust. According to the complaint, the doctor promised kidney transplant and got Rs 33 lakh for the process in 2013 but did not perform the surgery or return the money.

 According to Sola police, Dharampal Dhiman, 26, a resident of Panchkula, Haryana, is a relative of Dharamjit Kaur, a native of Roopnagar, Punjab who is at present a citizen of Malaysia. In 2013, Dharamjit developed kidney complications. 
 
 She had come across Dr Suresh Prajapati, founder and managing director of   and Facility, located at Vande Mataram Arcade, Chandlodia near SG Road. She had contacted Dr Prajapati for the treatment.
 
 “Dr Prajapati had promised her that he will arrange for a kidney donor and will also perform a surgery. In 2013, when she came to India the hospital allegedly asked her to pay Rs 33 lakh towards different charges after they claimed to have found a donor with matching blood group. She, through her relatives in India, paid the full money in advance in October 2013,” said a Sola police official.
 
 According to the complaint, after receiving the money, Dr Prajapati cited legal permission for procedure from the government and asked her to come back from Malaysia after he calls her up. The hospital staff allegedly never called her up for treatment despite several calls and emails. As her treatment for kidney ailments is going on in Malaysia, Dhiman has lodged the complaint on her behalf.
