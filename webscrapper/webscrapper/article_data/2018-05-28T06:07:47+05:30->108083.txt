HYDERABAD: With all schools set to reopen for the new academic session in the next four days, the demand for extending   by another 15 days is coming from all corners.

 
 Parents and child-right activists say the high   prevailing in the state will take a toll on the children’s health and added that it would be better if government postpone the schools reopening date from June 1 to mid-June.
 
 
 “Even now the temperature is around   in the state and it doesn’t make sense to start classes from the beginning of June. There is no need to hurry. Instead classes should start around June 12 or 15,” said  , whose son is studying in class 7 at a private school.
 
 
 Another parent, Kumari M said,“They shouldn’t be starting school just for celebrating state formation day in a grand way on June 2. If needed, they can ask interested students to assemble at schools on the said day and participate in the celebrations.”
 
 
 Seconding with parents, child right activists too said that the government should postpone the reopening dates of schools.
 
 
 “We are concerned about the children’s health. They should not be made to attend classes in the sizzling heat and it would be better if the state changes their decision to beging the academic session on the first day of June,” said Achyuta Rao, a childrights activist said, adding that schools should not be opened before June 13.
 
 
 Some parents suggested that the government should at least consider conducting half-day school up till mid-June.
 
 
 “If the state wants to reopen schools by June 1, they should at least announce schools to conduct half-day classes. They should do it immediately as there is hardly any time left for schools to re-open for the new academic session,” said Md Rasheed, a parent.
