VADODARA: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra   on Friday announced here that his government will grant Rs 50 lakh to the Akhil Bhartiya Marathi Sahitya Sammelan from next year. Fadnavis, who was in the city to inaugurate the three-day Marathi literature festival, also praised   Gaekwad III for patronizing Marathi literature during his rule in the erstwhile Baroda state. 

 “Our government has been giving Rs 25 lakh help but that amount is less to organize such festival. So I announced that the government will give Rs 50 lakh for the next sammelan,” Fadnavis told the crowd that had gathered at the festival on D N Hall Ground. Stressing that Marathi is one of the most important languages in the country, he said that the number of sammelans that happen in Marathi don’t happen in any other languages.
 
 When organizers of the literature festival demanded for a Marathi Vidyapeeth, Fadnavis said that he supports it and his government will think about it positively. The inauguration ceremony was attended by Maharashtra education minister, Vinod Tawde, Shriniwas Patil, Governor of Sikkim, royal family members, Samarjitsinh Gaekwad, Shubhanginiraje Gaekwad, Radhikaraje Gaekwad, Mayor Bharat Dangar and Vadodara MP, Ranjan Bhatt. 
 
 It is after 84 years that the city again got an opportunity to host this sahitya sammelan that was patronized by Maharaja Sayajirao. It was held here thrice in 1909, 1921 and 1934. Shubhanginiraje praised the festival and said that it is a blend of Marathi and   literature and culture. The inaugural event began with the speech that Maharaja Sayajirao had given during the first Marathi Sahitya Sammelan here in 1909. In the morning, the book containing speeches of Maharaja Sayajirao was released. 
 
 Nearly 500 students are attending the literature festival that is also offering workshops apart from a number of book-stalls.
