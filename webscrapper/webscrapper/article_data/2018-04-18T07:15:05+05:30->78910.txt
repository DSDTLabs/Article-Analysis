The Surat police on Tuesday claimed to have hit upon an important lead in identifying the 11-year-old girl who was raped and brutalised and her body dumped behind roadside bushes in Surat’s   area on April 6. 

 In a hurriedly-called presser late, police commissioner Satish   said a man from   has claimed to be the father of the girl. The man, accompanied by an   police officer, met Sharma on Tuesday and produced the girl’s Aadhaar card. 
 
 The man claimed his daughter had gone missing from home in October last year and he had lodged a ‘missing person’ complaint too. Sharma, however, said DNA tests will be crucial in confirming the relationship.
