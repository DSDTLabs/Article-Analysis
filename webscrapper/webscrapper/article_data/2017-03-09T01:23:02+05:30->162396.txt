Panaji: A petition has been filed with the Goa   Commission (GHRC) over the alleged suicide of a peon, who had retired from the High Court of Bombay at Goa, and had been struggling to get his pension papers cleared.

 Advocate Aires Rodrigues, who filed the petition, has requested the commission to direct the chief secretary and the director of accounts to explain what measures they plan to take to ensure that there is no violation of human rights of government employees by way of delay in processing of pension papers of staff that retire.
 
 The 62-year-old peon from Sattari had retired on August 31 2016 and has been struggling to get his pension papers cleared ever since, the petition states, adding, “A government employee should, as a matter of right, start receiving pension immediately after retirement. It is high time authorities awaken to the reality that in delaying clearing of pension papers, they cannot leave the retired person in financial distress.” tnn
