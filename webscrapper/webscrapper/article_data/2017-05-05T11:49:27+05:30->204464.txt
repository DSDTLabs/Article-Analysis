NASHIK: Only few owners of   in the district have come forward to relocate their outlets following Supreme Court’s directives, banning sale of alcohol within 500 m   and  

 A total of 791 of the total 1,111 liquor shops have shut their operations in the district following the apex court’s order.
 
 Of total 791 closed shops, only 35 licensed outlets have so far applied for migration of their outlets with the state excise department. Apparently, majority of the liquor shop owners, affected due to the court’s decision, are still awaiting state’s government move to denotify the highways so that they can resume their businesses. 
 
 An official from the state excise department told TOI, “We have already implemented the   order banning liquor, beer shops and other licensed outlets located within 500m radius of the highways in the district. They have an option to shift their outlets, but so far only 35 outlet owners have approached us.”
 
 When contacted, Sanjay Patil, president of Nashik Liquor Merchants’ Association, said, “The government does not seem positive about denotification of the highways. Now, there is no option, but to shift the shops outside the 500m radius. Although response for shifting liquor shops and other licensed outlets is still poor, the affected liquor shop owners will soon start shifting their outlets.”
 
 Recently, Maharashtra Liquor Merchants Association had approached the state government and demanded to denotify the highways in the limits of the municipal corporations across the state so that liquor shops and other licensed outlets get relief. But the government has not taken a decision yet. Finally, liquor shop owners have started looking for option of shifting to other places.
