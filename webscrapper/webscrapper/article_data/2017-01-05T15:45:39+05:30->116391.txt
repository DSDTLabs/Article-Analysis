NAGPUR: The state government has granted land belonging to Government   College and Hospital ( ) in   (TB) Ward to Nagpur Composite Regional Centre (CRC) of National Institute for Empowerment of Persons with Multiple Disabilities (NIEPMD), Chennai. It is a Rs130 crore project to provide prosthetic aids and other help to handicapped persons. Union transport minister   had been pursuing the project since long.

 A government resolution (GR) issued on Wednesday stated that of the total 1,90,694 square metre land in TB Ward, 22,320 square metre (about 5.5 acre) was being taken back from GMCH and given to NIEPMD. The land was being given for a period of 30 years on a nominal annual ground rent of Rs1. 
 
 The decision to provide the land was taken in cabinet meeting held on December 15. The union social justice ministry had in February 2015 urged the state government to provide 5 acre free of cost for setting up the CRC. NIEPMD itself had sought the land in December 2015.
 
 A local NGO Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Institute of Medical Sciences, Research and Human Resources, of which Gadkari is past president, had also been pleading with the government for a permanent place for CRC in the city. Its current president Dr Viral Kamdar has been pushing the project. 
 
 In the past, GMCH officials have opposed taking away of their land. They claim that they had several expansion plans on the land. They include a central government sponsored Regional Paramedical Institute. There were also plans to develop new TB centre, a skin ward and an infectious ward.
