MUMBAI: If there’s one thing that has been at the receiving end of severe criticism in the   (ISL) and the   this season, it’s been the standard of refereeing. Coaches from both leagues have often lashed out at the poor standard of refereeing. They’ve been fined and banned for their comments, but that hasn’t stopped them from speaking their minds.

 
 Seeing that something needs to change, the   ( ) executive committee is likely to ask their director of referees,  , to step down at the end of the season, sources have told TOI.
 
 “The committee felt that something needed to change for the betterment of Indian football in general. Therefore, they felt that asking Kar to leave was the way forward,” a source said.
 
 Fed up with the myriad of poor, match-changing decisions that have affected teams this season, the ISL organisers had requested the AIFF to appoint foreign referees for the business-end of the tournament. The AIFF finally complied with the ISL’s demand and called for foreign referees.
 
 Kar had earlier told TOI that it was a conscious decision to have Indian referees officiate at the start of the tournament in order to give them more exposure. When asked to comment on the string of poor decisions at the time, Kar replied with the cliche, “Referees all over the world make mistakes. They are humans after all. That being said, the quality is fast improving.”
 
 When asked if Kar had been told to quit, AIFF general secretary   replied in the negative. “The executive committee hasn’t made any such decision. People may talk about it, but we haven’t decided anything,” Das said.
