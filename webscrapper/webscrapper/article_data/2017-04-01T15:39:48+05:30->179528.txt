'Ant-Man and the Wasp' director   has rubbished reports of   joining 'Ant-Man and the Wasp'. 
Taking the leaf out of Donald Trump's book, the director took to Twitter to clarify the report, "The Russians are swarm-tweeting that Hawkeye is in ANT-MAN AND THE WASP. #FakeNews." 
 
 
    himself hasn't commented on the reports, but he is currently in Atlanta to film 'Avengers: Infinity War' with Earth's Mightiest  . 
 
  
  
 Reed, who directed the first 'Ant-Man' film, will return behind the lens for the sequel. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are expected to reprise their roles as Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne respectively.
