NAGPUR: RPI (Athawale) has taken a back foot with one day left for polling in the   (NMC) elections. The party led by union minister of state for social justice Ramdas Athawale has extended support to the Bharatiya Janata Party ( ) for 147 of total 151 seats.

 Before commencement of election campaign, RPI (Athawale), which is an alliance partner of BJP and   in the central and state governments, had declared pre-poll alliance with the saffron party. BJP gave tickets to only two candidates of RPI (Athawale)-- Vanmala Kamble from ward no. 7 and Nilesh Kumbhare from ward no. 35. Upset over tickets distribution, the republican party broke up alliance with BJP and fielded its own candidates. RPI (Athawale) even lodged complaint with collector and municipal commissioner against BJP for using its name in the election campaign. Also, RPI (Athawale) had threatened the BJP to file an election petition.
 
 RPI (Athawale) state president Bhupesh Thulkar on Sunday told TOI that support has been declared to 147 of 151 seats. “Athawale and chief minister   held two meetings. Athawale directed us to extend support. RPI (Athawale) had declared support to four candidates — Sadhana Temburkar (ward no. 9), Hiralal Hadke (ward no. 13), Meenakshi Borkar (ward no. 38) and Avantika Tambe (ward no. 13) — so will not support BJP in these seats,” he said.
