Surat: The garden department of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will be using treated sewage water for plants on road dividers across the city.  The initiative is part of the save water campaign of the civic body under which it plans to save at least 100 million litre per day (MLD) of water from its regular supply of 1,150 MLD that the city gets from Ukai.  The civic body has already started using water from two of its sewage treatment plants (STP) for watering plants in some parts of the city.  SMC is expected to cover rest of the areas in the city by March 31 using water from five STPs in different zones.  SMC garden superintendent S Gautam said, “We use nearly 15 lakh litre water on plants kept on dividers. Currently, we have started using 3 lakh litre from STPs of Bhatar and Karanj and would increase off take to 15 lakh litre from other STPs in the next 30 days.” An SMC official said that this would be made into a regular routine in the coming days.  After the dividers that are approximately 250km is covered, the second phase will begin in which all 172 gardens of the city including 60 Shantikunj, 20 lake gardens and 92 other gardens would be covered under the project. This treated water, filled in tankers, is currently used for plants in the city.
