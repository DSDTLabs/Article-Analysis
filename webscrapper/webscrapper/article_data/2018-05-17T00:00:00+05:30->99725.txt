That   is playing the lead in   Ravichandran’s next with GV Prakash is already known. But what’s interesting is that her role in the film will have two different shades. 

 Talking more about it, Adhik says, “Amyra’s role is on par with that of GV Prakash. She plays GV’s childhood sweetheart. You might have multiple relationships over the course of your life, but there is always that one special love that one can never forget. Amyra’s role is one such and she will be there throughout the film. Her role has two shades — one is that of a girl-next-door and the other is where her character has a divine touch.” Prod him for a little more dope on the role and he says, “This portion has a lot of fantasy elements. I can’t reveal too much about the part where she will have a godly connect as it might reveal the plot itself.”
 
  He adds, “Amyra is the one who will fight for true love and will go to any extent to prove it. She is innocent, but at the same time, her role has a changeover that is emotionally driven. Her character is written in such a manner where anyone will fall for her.” The team will head to   to shoot the next schedule with   and GV Prakash.
