NEW DELHI: BJP demanded Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s resignation on Thursday, hours after the ruling party lost the Rajouri Garden bypolls in which its candidate had to forfeit his deposit. 

 BJP and its ally, SAD (Badal), said that there will be a repeat of this result in the upcoming municipal polls. Delhi BJP chief   said that the party will win more than 202 seats in the municipal polls. “People feel betrayed by AAP as it has failed to deliver on its promises,” said Tiwari.
 
 West Delhi MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma demanded Kejriwal’s resignation and said that the Delhi CM should let people decide if they want him as the CM or not. “He should resign from his constituency and let people decide if he deserves to be the CM. He should resign on moral grounds,” said Verma.
 
 Accusing AAP of doublespeak, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who won by 14,652 votes in the bypolls, said, “Kejriwal used to say he will ask people before doing any work. Did he ask people before spending Rs 97 crore on advertising? When it comes to doing public’s work, he says that Modiji doesn’t let him work. How is this government spending crores of public money on its publicity?” said Sirsa.
 
 Taking a dig at Kejriwal for his allegation of tampering in EVMs and demand for paper ballot, Sirsa said, “Kejriwal’s downslide has begun. He can go on making false allegations of tampering in EVMs but that will not convince voters”. The party also attacked Congress and said that people have not forgotten the corruption cases against it. BJP said that though the party has got the second highest votes in the bypolls, the party stood third in the polling booth of DPCC chief Ajay Maken.
