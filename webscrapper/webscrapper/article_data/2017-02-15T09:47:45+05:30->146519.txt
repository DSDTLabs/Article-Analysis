CHANDIGARH: At a time when   are becoming common in the city, the police have surprisingly not found a single case of   in the  . In the last 45 days, the cops have registered 51 such cases — all of them from areas like Dhanas, Burail, Hallomajra, Daria and Kansal. 

 The police are not wasting any time in arresting residents of mostly villages and colonies, but are completely ignoring sectors, where youngsters drink in cars outside liquor vends, restaurants and night clubs — a dangerous practice that is fuelling violence. 
 
 A TOI team visited posh localities of sectors 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 26 during late night hours and found a number of people enjoying whisky and beer in their cars, without any fear of the men in khaki as there were none present. At Sector 22 near hotel Aroma, one of the favourite haunts of youngsters in late night hours, too, people could be seen drinking in public, even though police were present nearby.
 
 Cops, in their defence, say whenever they try to stop people from drinking in public in posh areas, they turn out to know some influential people or are friends of bureaucrats. “They make calls to senior policemen directly and apply pressure. We have no option but to free them,” says a police official.
 
 On an average this year, the police have registered almost one case daily under section 68-1-14 of Excise Act against people found drinking liquor at public places but not a single one in any of the posh areas.
