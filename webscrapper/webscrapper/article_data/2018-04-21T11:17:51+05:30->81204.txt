CHANDIGARH: The residents of the city, who have neither deposited their property tax to the tax branch of the Chandigarh municipal corporation in the last financial year nor in the previous ones, are going to get fresh notices from the civic body. The residents, who did not pay the amount for the additional constructed area in their respective houses will also be issued fresh notices.

As there had been no compiled record of the tax filing amounts of the residential properties, the hired private company has surveyed the residential areas and submitted the required data to the MC. On the basis of the report, the data of each property is being fed, so that those who did not pay the tax in the previous years, could be traced out. "We have been feeding the data ward wise and till date data of around 2,000 residents have already been fed. After completing the process of the each municipal ward, we will start issuing notices after couple of weeks," said a senior officers of the MC.
 
 "Interestingly, we have found in many cases that people deposited the property tax on the basis of old construction and did not include the fresh construction in their respective houses. Thus, details and data of all such properties is also being prepared to take tax from such residents accordingly," he added.
 
 Sources in the MC revealed that besides the entire tax amount, arrears of some of the properties have also come in the light, but the exact number of such properties would come only after feeding the entire data. Since the MC has started maintaining digital records of such properties also since the past few months, the authority is also cross-checking the arrears of such properties, so that notices can be issued accordingly.
