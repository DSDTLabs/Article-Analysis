NAGPUR: The Forest Advisory Committee (FCA), the topmost body under MoEFCC considering forest land diversion proposals, has recommended diversion of 141.99 hectares forest land near Nagzira for   Power Maharashtra Ltd (APML) in Tiroda in   district.

 The proposal came up before FAC meeting on February 28, 2017. The 141.99 hectares is zudpi and protected forest land, equivalent to roughly 103 football fields, and is barely 8km from Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR).
 
 This is the second forest land diversion since commissioning of the 3,300MW plant in 2013. Earlier, 164 hectares forest land has been diverted to the power major.
 
 The fresh land has been demanded for setting up ash utilization, promotion and research park at Kachewani and   villages in Tiroda. However, representations of wildlife conservationists and environmentalists opposing the diversion fell on deaf ears at the FAC. Adani has roped in a German firm to set up ash park by investing Rs60 crore.
 
 Wildlife experts had said that ash utilization and management in forest area was questionable given that forests were already burdened with site specific projects. “Diversion of forest lands for such non-site specific forest activity is not justifiable. It will hamper long-term conservation of tigers,” said Kishor Rithe, former member of National Board for Wildlife (NBWL).
 
 The FAC recommended the proposal with standard guidelines and has asked Adani Power to associate government institutes such as Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM) and Tropical Forest Research Institute (TFRI) to draw up a forestry research plan at the cost of user agency for utilization of fly ash and submit documents in this regard.
 
 FAC Recommendation
 
 * Draw forestry research plan by roping in reputable government institutes
 
 * The research results and all data shall be shared with MoEFCC and all other institutes free of cost
 
 * No alteration or diversion of water course within the proposal land
 
 * No construction of buildings on forest land sought for diversion
