MUMBAI: The BJP-led state government is to purchase a Rs 20 lakh car for Maratha leader  , chairman of the implementation and coordination committee for the Rs 2,560 crore Shivaji   project.

 The move comes at a juncture when the debt burden of the state government has crossed Rs 4.33 lakh crore.
 
 
 The PWD led by senior   politician   on Wednesday issued an official order for the purchase of the car for the implementation and coordination committee.
 
 A senior official said that despite chief minister Devendra Fadnavisâ€™s order, the proposal was delayed by nearly three years.
 
 The finance department led by senior BJP politician Sudhir Mungantiwar had opposed the proposal, saying there was no provision for providing a vehicle to the implementation and coordination committee.
 
 To get over the difficulty, it was proposed that the vehicle be purchased in the name of the PWD and then handed over to the implementation and coordination committee.
 
 At the same time, the PWD made it clear that the post of driver should not be created and that the department should provide a driver.
 
 The senior official said that the purchase of the vehicle was uncalled for and the PWD should instead have made available a vehicle whenever there was a need for the chairman or any member of the Shivaji memorial implementation and coordination committee to use one.
 
 The official said that such expenditure on purchase of cars for visiting VIPs across the state or for heads of committees could have been avoided. A month ago, a provision of Rs 4 crore had been made for procuring cars for visiting VIPs in all the districts.
