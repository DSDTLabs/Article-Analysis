KANPUR: The third round of document verification work for admission to IITs and other institutes related to JEE Advanced, commenced at all IITs on Tuesday, including IIT-Kanpur. A total of three students went to the institute to freeze the seats alloted to them. 

 Earlier, these students had 'floated' the allotted   and the particular B.Tech branch. But not satisfied with the choice and on not getting better B.Tech branch as expected by them in the third round, they decided to opt for the given choice.
 
 Talking to TOI, Prof Shalabh, vice-chairman of   zone, informed the three candidates got their documents verified and chose to freeze the seats which had been allotted to them earlier. The third round would continue till 1 pm on July 13, he added. 
 
 Out of a total 827 seats, only five seats of B.Tech course are left to be filled in IIT-K. It is expected that by the end of the third round no seat will remain vacant here.
 
  (JOSAA) had to revise the counselling and document verification schedule because the Supreme Court had first stayed the counselling in the IITs and later vacated the stay on Monday. Between Friday (when the stay was ordered) and Sunday, the schedule, as decided by JOSAA, could not be followed, and therefore, the new schedule was released by JOSAA on Tuesday evening. 
 
 According to the new schedule, the candidates would be able to see the number of seats filled and its availability on July 13 after 5 pm, and this will mark the start of the fourth round of counselling. 
 
 The result of seat allocation in the fourth round will be available to the candidates after 8 pm on July 13. On July 14 and 15, candidates will have the option to either accept or withdraw the seats. The detailed revised schedule of document verification, acceptance/withdrawal of seats has been provided by JOSAA on its website which can students can check.
