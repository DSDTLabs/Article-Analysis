AHMEDABAD: The longest flyover on the   at Bopal Crossroads is likely to be inaugurated by April this year. The overbridge, which has a project cost of Rs 94.51 crore, had its deadline set for February this year. Officials, however, now expect that it will take until April to open the flyover for public use. Construction work of the bridge began in 2014 and for the last 30 months it has led to severe traffic jams in the area.

  Chairman of the  ,  , said the overbridge will put an end to traffic problems of people coming from Bopal-Ghuma and heading towards Ahmedabad city. The overbridge ,which is nearly 1.4 km long, will have two lanes on both sides and will pass above two crossroads, said officials.
 
 “Without the bridge, there is always a danger of accidents as speeding truck drivers never apply brakes, even when approaching crossroads,” said   a resident of Bhavya Park. Several deaths from accidents by heavy vehicles have been reported at the crossroads, he said. An AUDA officer, however, said that instead of solving traffic issues, the situation at the end of the bridge may lead to more accidents, as there is a right-turn for Sun City residential society where the bridge ends. The officer said AUDA will have to block the turn towards Sun City.
