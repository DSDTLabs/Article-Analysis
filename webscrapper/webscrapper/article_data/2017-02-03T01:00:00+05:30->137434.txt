 and   recently tied the knot in style. The bride rode a bike to the venue to impress her biker husband and even stitched the flowers gifted by him during their courtship on the border of her dupatta. The actress says, “We had an intimate wedding at Siddhant’s ancestral house in Nashik. He is a biker, so I thought of doing something wacky. I rode a bike, dressed in a bridal lehenga, to the venue. The expression on his face was priceless.”
About stitching the flowers on her dupatta, she says, “Siddhant always insisted on me making a scrap book of our love story, but I wanted to do something extraordinary. When he didn’t notice my dupatta till the third phera, I took the mic from the pandit and told my groom that instead of making a scrap book, I was wearing one.”
 The couple exchanged nuptial vows after a courtship of two-and-a-half years. They got engaged on May 12 and had a court wedding in August last year.
