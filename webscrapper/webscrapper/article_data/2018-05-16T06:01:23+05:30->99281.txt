GUWAHATI:   government employees have decided to join hands with All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu) to intensify protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016, with the slogan “Job not above motherland”. The move is likely to create problems for the Sarbananda Sonowal-led BJP government in the state.

 
 The   (SAKP) — the association with the support of almost 4 lakh Assam government employees — on Tuesday announced state-wide agitations in protest against the Bill, saying if implemented it would threaten the identity, culture and heritage of indigenous people of Assam.
 
 The association said it would also urge the state government to ensure an errorfree National Register of Citizens (NRC). “...We decided to join hands with Aasu to fight for the state’s cause, ” said SAKP chief Basab Kalita.
 
 On Tuesday, a 100-hour “economic” blockade was organised by the Jatiyo-Jangosthiyo Aikyo Mancha ( ), an umbrella organisation of 12 outfits, in Dibrugarh. Protesters burnt tyres to block NH-37, connecting Assam to Manipur. Hundreds of vehicles, including Oil India Limited tankers and Coal India trucks, were left stranded. However, vehicles carrying essential commodities were allowed to ply.
 
 “So far there is no plan to call off the blockade. We want to send out a strong message to the Centre... The Bill, if implemented, will jeopardise the future of indigenous people of Assam,” said  , a JJAM member. “When the state is facing widespread protests against the Citizenship... Bill, he (Sonowal) chose to go to   and that too by a chartered flight. This shows how irresponsible the chief minister is,” former CM   said.
