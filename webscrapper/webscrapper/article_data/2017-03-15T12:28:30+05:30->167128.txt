THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: It is high time to do away with caste-based professions like  , which is inherited from one generation and imposed on the next without question, said director  , who won the state award for the   for her film ‘Manhole’.

 She was speaking at the valedictory function of the two-day national seminar ‘Freedom under Siege’ conducted by the English Department of University College, here on Tuesday.
 
 “People earn a living dealing with sewage and excreta even after manual scavenging was banned. The film introspects about the potential options of liberation and freedom from such works which is imposed on them traditionally. The film speaks in the language of ground reality and truth. In  , the language of the oppressed is addressed through the language of their apprehension,” said Vidhu. 
 
 Head of the Department Chribuna Viswas felicitated Vidhu Vincent with a plaque and golden shawl at the event, which was conducted as part of the 150th anniversary of the college.
 
 “The practice of untouchability still prevails in our society in many unseen and unnoticed ways. Even during festivals and marriages, people refuse to drink tea or have food from the house of the scavengers. The term freedom connotes different meaning to different sections in the society. When I made this film, I have tried to present these painful realities on a bigger canvas,” said the director. Those people had been enchained in this profession in pretext of their castes, she added.
 
 During the event, nine former students of the English department who had cleared the UGC-NET exams were felicitated. Faculty members C Ravi Chandran, Nisha S and KrishnaKumar also spoke at the meeting.
