MOTIHARI: Taking exception to the delay in completion of Piparakothi-Raxaul highway (NH-28A), the National Highways Authority of India ( )’s legal cell on Tuesday served a notice to construction company, threatening termination of the contract. 

 The highway project is being executed along the Indo-Nepal border in north Bihar by the Tantiya Road Construction Company, which was given the deadline of March 2014 to complete the project. Even though the company has worked for seven years on the project, around 65% work remains incomplete.
 
 The two-lane highway stretching to around 62km connects Delhi to Kathmandu. It is in such a deplorable condition that vehicles take at least three hours to cover the 62km distance.
 
 East Champaran DM Raman Kumar, meanwhile, travelled on the stretch along with the project manager on Tuesday and expressed anguish over the pitiable condition of the highway. He directed the project manager to make the road at least motorable before Durga Puja. 
 
 Local MP Sanjay Jaiswal said a large number of tourists, including foreigners, travel through the route during Durga Puja. “I have urged the Centre to take action against the road construction company,” he said. 
 
 Sources said at least 1,000 trucks and trailers carrying cargo from the Haldia port pass through this road on way to Kathmandu daily. Nepal PM Sher Bahadur Deuba during his recent visit to India sought PM Narendra Modi’s intervention to complete this link road for smooth trade between the two countries.
