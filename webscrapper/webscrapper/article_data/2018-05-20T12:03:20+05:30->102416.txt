SECUNDERABAD: Ever had to pay extra for food on trains and railway stations? The South Central Railway is now looking to curb this vexatious problem by drawing up a “robust” action plan to clamp down on errant caterers.

 
 Decoy teams comprising commercial officers, catering inspectors and ticket checking staff will conduct surprise raids at railway stations. “If any vendor is caught selling items for more than the prescribed rates, we shall seize his identity card and slap fines on them,” a railway official said.
 
 “We are taking stringent steps against vendors and catering agencies for overcharging. Recently, we issued licence termination notices to two tea stalls at   and Falaknuma stations and a cell kitchen at Gudur station,” the official added.
 
 Sources said SCR general manager Vinod Kumar Yadav’s instructions to railway officials came in the wake of railway minister Piyush Goyal’s directives to maintain quality of food and proper pricing. Several people have complained on the railway ministry’s official Twitter page about catering staff demanding extra money.
 
 “The ticket I booked to reach Krishnarajapuram included the price of food, but I had to pay extra. After I lodged a complaint, a catering staff returned the money,” said  , a commuter in Humsafar Express. Another passenger, Satchidananda Rath rued, “The catering staff charged ?100 for a vegetarian lunch that officially costs ?45. When I demanded the bill, the waiter never came back.”
 
 Officials from SCR’s commercial department have started keeping tabs on catering services. “Vinod Kumar Yadav has reviewed the status of catering services and asked us to check whether food items are being sold as per the guidelines laid down by the railways,” a senior railway official told STOI.
