CHANDIGARH: When 35-year-old Pooja Sahni was told her 9-year-old son   had cancer, she went numb. Kshitij was diagnosed with   lymphoma,a form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma associated with impaired immunity. “The Big C affected our lives three years ago and shattered our happiness. My son could not attend school for long. He used to feel tired and weak,” said Pooja.

 Kshitij emerged victorious after a three-year battle with the disease but says the ordeal was great. “I was admitted to the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research ( ) hospital in Chandigarh for almost a year. I underwent four cycles of chemotherapy, and it used to drain me out. I could not eat as the taste of bitter medicines stayed for long,” he said. He lost over eight kgs during this phase. 
 
 There were times when Kshitij used to cry in pain and he had started losing his appetite too. “My daughter was five years old then. I could not pay attention to her. Most of the time was spent in rushing to hospital for medicines and reports. But adversity made us stronger and we fought to win the battle,” said his mother.
 
 As the family had not ignored the symptoms, Kshitij was treated on time and is now cured. “I used to wonder why cancer struck my son. But when we were in hospital, after having seeing others and talking to them, I calmed down,” said Pooja.
 
 Dr Deepak Bansal, who has been treating childhood cancers in PGIMER, said, “Cancer is a life-changing experience. But 70% of childhood cancers are curable if treated on time. The treatment lasts seven to eight months and the cost in a public hospital is between Rs2 lakh and Rs2.5 lakh.”
