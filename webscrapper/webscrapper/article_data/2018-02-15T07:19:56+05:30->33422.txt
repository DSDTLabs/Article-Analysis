 “Some 20 persons were detained for illegal protests on Valentine’s day. Security was beefed up at the riverfront,” said K L N Rao, special commissioner of police. An FIR was lodged against four accused for carrying wooden sticks and threatening couples for sitting on the riverfront. Jay Shah, VHP, spokesperson said, “VHP and Bajrang Dal workers staged peaceful protests against celebration of Valentine’s day at Karnavati riverfront and public places in other districts. We aimed at creating awareness among Hindu youths against following this trend of the western world and about the conspiracy of love jihad. We requested youth to celebrate the day as ‘Mata Pita Pujan divas’ instead. It’s unfortunate that police arrested and harassed our workers.”
