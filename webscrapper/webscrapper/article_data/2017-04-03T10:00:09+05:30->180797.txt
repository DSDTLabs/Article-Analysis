KANPUR: People are worshipping Goddess Durga in the ongoing Chaitra Navratra by visiting temples. Each temple has its own significance and an interesting story to tell. 

 Maa   Devi temple, situated in the Kathri village in the ravines on the banks of river   in   district remains crowded during the holy days of Navratra. 
 
 Devotees from across the state as well as those from other neighbouring states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan visit this ancient temple on the sixth day of Navratra as Maa Katyayani is the sixth form of Maa Durga. The idol here is believed to be 500 years old and was installed by villagers of Shahjahanpur who found it from a water body.
 
 Legend has it that the Goddess appeared in their dreams and instructed them to install the idol. "The crowd here is overwhelming. Some people travel barefoot to this place as a sign of their dedication to Maa Durga. The enthusiasm of devotees who come here during Navratra is incomparable," head priest Balwan Singh Tyagi said. Maa Katyayani is the sixth form of Maa Durga, so the sixth day of Navratra is dedicated to Maa Katyayani.
 
 She is called Katyayani because she was born as the daughter of Sage Katya of Katya clan. "Legend has it that sage Katyayan performed hard penance of Maa Bhagvati. It was his wish that Maa Durga is born as his daughter. The Goddess fulfilled his wish," Tyagi said. 
 
 Even brigands of Chambal used to frequent and seek blessings of Maa Katyayani Devi temple when dacoity was at its peak in the region, the villagers of Kathri said. "After committing crime, bandit queen   used to visit Maa Katyayani Devi temple and thank the Goddess for her safety and security," local native Gulab Singh said.
