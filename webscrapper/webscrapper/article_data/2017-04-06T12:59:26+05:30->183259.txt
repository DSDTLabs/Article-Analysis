Kanye West's album "The Life of Pablo" has become the eighth LP by the rapper to achieve the platinum status. 

 The news comes in almost a year after the release of his album. A representative for the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) confirmed the certification to Billboard. 
 
  
  
 Kanye's label   Jam says the project is the first-ever streaming-only set to go platinum. 
 
 On the other hand, Billboard reported in April last year that 'TLOP' was available for sale on his official website after its February release. 
 
 The album secured the number one spot on the Billboard 200 after 70 per cent of its debut earnings accounted from streaming. 
 
 The star-studded LP featured artists including Chance the Rapper, The Weeknd,  , Chris Brown, Frank Ocean and more.
