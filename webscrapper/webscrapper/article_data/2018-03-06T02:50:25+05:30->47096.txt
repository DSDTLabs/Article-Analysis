MUMBAI:   (FINS), which calls itself a think tank working on national security issues, has come out with its findings and analysis on the Koregaon   violence which erupted on January 1. Blaming the police for its laxity, FINS has recommended action against the police.The report has raised questions over the historical aspect of Koregaon Bhima, and has suggested a need to issue 'practising licences' to professional historians, similar to the one given to legal professionals. 

 The report alleges it is evident from the collected information that the root cause of the riot is systematic and consistent distortion and falsification of Indian history. According to FINS, the report, which will be submitted to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, was compiled based on personal interviews, social media messages, reports in print and electronic media, and information collected and analysed.
 
 Nearly 50 villagers comprising victims, eyewitnesses, key stakeholders from different communities, police and gram panchayat members from the three affected villages were interviewed, said an office-bearer of FINS. "FINS demands a probe in the wider conspiracy of  ," he stated.
 
 Violence had erupted at an event to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Koregaon-Bhima battle in which British imperial forces comprising Dalits had defeated the Peshwa army.

In the wake of the incident, various Dalit organisations observed a statewide bandh on January 3, which took a violent turn.
