Ahmedabad: A special CBI court on Friday issued notice to the investigating agency in response to bail applications filed by four accused arrested in connection with exchange of demonetized currency notes worth Rs 60.52 crore by officials of the Bank of India (BOI) in Surat.

 The court has sought CBI’s reply on bail pleas by January 10.
 
 Meanwhile, all four accused persons including BOI’s Ghod Dod Road branch manager JH Bansal argued in their applications that the money was deposited in the bank as per the norms laid down by the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India. There was no cap on deposit, and since the amount was above Rs 2.5 lakh, the bank followed all formalities of verifying KYC. In this process, the investigating agency cannot invoke charges under the Indian Penal Code.
 
 Meanwhile, all the four accused were sent to jail by the court after their two-day custodial interrogation was over.
