While reports were already doing the rounds of   joining the cast of   starrer ‘Kesari’,   confirmed the same on his twitter handle yesterday by announcing her name with a picture of Akshay Kumar’s ‘Kesari’ look. 

  
  
 The director was reportedly trolled on the micro-blogging site for posting an update on Parineeti with not hers but Akshay Kumar’s photo. Following which, Karan was quick to apologise and correct his mistake. Taking to his micro-blogging site, he posted the news yet again, this time with the actress’ picture. 
 
  
  
 He wrote, “Ok guys that was meant to be an image of   whilst announcing the lead actress of the film. Clearly Twitter is quick to jump and attack! Apologies!!!!! This is to re announce the wonderfully talented Parineeti Chopra as lead cast of Kesari."
 
 However, Parineeti seemed to be unperturbed by all this. She excitedly reposted Karan’s tweet and wrote, “So excited to be a part of this legendary journey!!! Thank you.”
 
  
  
 According to reports, Parineeti will be seen playing the role of Akshay Kumar’s wife in ‘Kesari’. 'Kesari', was originally meant to be co-produced by Karan and Salman Khan, though the latter backed out late last year.
