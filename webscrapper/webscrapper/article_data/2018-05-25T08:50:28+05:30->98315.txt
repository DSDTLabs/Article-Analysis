 Police said the flyover couldn’t be closed earlier as the road beneath it was unavailable for diversions due to metro construction activity. 
 
 TOI had first reported that a huge gap had developed between the girders of the flyover and highlighted that a major disaster was waiting to happen. The Delhi government had commissioned the repair work in December and work was to be started from January 2. But it had to be put on hold without permission to divert traffic and Republic Day approaching. “We postponed it to February, but it had to be put on hold again due to metro work at Ashram crossing. “Commuters have been asked to use the Barapullah Flyover for going towards Sarai Kale Khan and DND, and the Outer Ring Road for going towards Faridabad,” said joint CP (traffic) Garima Bhatnagar. 
 
 The work is expected to continue till May 30. 
 
 While heavy transport vehicles like trailers and containers, and light goods vehicles coming from Noida will have to take a left turn from Ashram Chowk and follow Mathura Road. Vehicles going towards Lajpat Nagar will be diverted from under the flyover. Commuters will also be asked to take Captain Gaur Marg towards Modi Mill. 
 
 Vehicles on the other carriageway will be asked to drive at 20km/hr to avoid further damage to the flyover. 
 
 Senior PWD officials said the gaps will be filled by extension joints. “Every flyover has such joints between two girders supported by pillars. In summer, these girders expand and shrink in winter. There is no need to panic as the gaps were formed due to natural contraction of the girders,” said a senior PWD official.
