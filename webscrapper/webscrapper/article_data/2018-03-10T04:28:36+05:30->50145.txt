MUMBAI: A high-ranking Mantralaya official has been caught red handed accepting abribe from an assistant engineer for a favourable report in adepartmental probe against him. Incidentally, the bribe-giver had been caught taking a bribe himself in 2013 and the departmental probe was entrusted to the Mantralaya official.

 Joint secretary (revenue)   and his nephew Prashant Gawali were caught taking Rs 25,000 from the assistant engineer, said an Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officer. Initially, Pawar had demanded Rs 40,000, but settled for Rs 25,000. Pawar is currently on deputation to the   divisional commissioner’s office as joint secretary and special inquiry officer.
 
 On March 26, 2013, assistant engineer   and a section engineer were caught taking Rs 10,000 from a   resident, whose land dispute had long been pending with the public works department. An offence under the prevention of corruption Act and IPC was registered against Wagh, and subsequently, a charge sheet was filed on May 16, 2014.
 
 While the criminal case is pending before a Dhule court, the departmental probe was entrusted to Pawar. During the probe, Pawar demanded Rs 40,000 for sending a favourable report to the government. He asked Wagh to hand over the amount to his nephew, Prashant Gawali.
 
 “We have registered offences under the prevention of corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code against Pawar and Gawali,” said the ACB officer.
 
 Despite demonetization and government vigilance, he rued that there was no end to corruption. “I think cases registered under the prevention of corruption Act should be entrusted to fast track courts for speedy disposal,” he said.
 
 The officer added that though chief minister   has asked the administration to suspend officials caught accepting bribe and dismiss all the convicted officials, it was found that most tainted officials continue in their jobs.
