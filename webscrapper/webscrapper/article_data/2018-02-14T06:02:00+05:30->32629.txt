GHAZIABAD: The UP state government initiated a series of confidence building measures on Tuesday with   agitating for higher compensation in   in Ghaziabad. A delegation of top officials led by   divisional commissioner Dr Prabhat Kumar and including Ghaziabad DM Ritu Maheshwari and Ghaziabad SSP Hari Narayan Singh met farmers in Mandola asking them to end their indefinite  .

 A group of 50 farmers have been staging the indefinite hunger strike since January 26. Several more farmers have staged a continuous sit-in at the protest site since December 2017 in bare upper bodies.
 
 Talks were initiated by the state government on Tuesday after leaders belonging to several opposition political parties began making a beeline to Mandola following the death of an 80-year-old farmer purportedly after he fell ill following several days of protests.
 
 Dr Prabhat Kumar told TOI, “Heeding our request, farmers have agreed to withdraw women and senior citizens from the hunger strike. They have demanded for withdrawal of criminal cases lodged against certain farmers by UP police during the agitations. We have assured them that a recommendation for withdrawing the cases will be sent to the state government.”
 
 He further said, “A set of farmers demanded that certain farming equipment belonging to them, including motor pumps, had been buried under the soil when construction work took place. We have told them these equipment will be unearthed and compensation will be paid for damages incurred. This was the first in a series of meetings held to boost confidence and trust of the farmers in the government,” 
 
 Farmers also demanded that officials declare the deceased farmer Mangu Khan a martyr. However, officials told them that they did not have the requisite powers to declare him a martyr.
