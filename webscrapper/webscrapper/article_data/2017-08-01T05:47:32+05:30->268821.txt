MUMBAI: A 43-year-old man arrested for allegedly duping city college professors had also targeted at least one schoolteacher, the police said on Monday. The senior teacher of Fatima Devi High School, Malad (east), was possibly the last victim of the accused, Rohit Pitamber alias Istiyak Sayyed, who was arrested on Friday, a day after the teacher, Flavia Quadros (57), was duped of Rs 3,000. 

 Quadros called up TOI after learning about the conman who has been held for cheating college professors and principals. The police said he visited colleges, claiming he was an alumnus and dropped names of former professors to lend credence to his claim.
 
 "He told me he was from the 1997 batch and that I taught him English. He even rattled off names of some retired teachers before hypnotizing me with his emotional story that he was falling short of money to pay hospital bills for his mother's treatment for a fracture," said Quadors. "I was unable to say no as he started crying in the school office."
 
  He even handed over a chit with his contact number, email id and claimed that he is the head of the finance department at a bank in the UK based," said Quadros who will lodge a complaint at Dindoshi police station.
 
 The police said Pitamber had also cheated a professor of Lala Lajpat Rai College, Tardeo. His custody was on Monday given to Powai police station for allegedly cheating a professor of NITIE, Powai, of Rs16,000 on July 5.
 
 The police said that Pitamber had a free run for two years as none of those whom he duped had bothered to approach the police.
