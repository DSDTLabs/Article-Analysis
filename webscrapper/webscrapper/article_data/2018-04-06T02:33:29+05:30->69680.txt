NEW DELHI: Police have arrested 11 people, three of them minors and two  , for a slew of   crimes in east Delhi. With their arrest from Mayur Vihar, cops claimed to have solved at least 14 cases spread over the last one month. They said the accused were on their way to commit another theft.

 Police got on the gang’s trail after an unusually large number of street crimes were reported from the area. The gang members possessed master keys and stole bikes using them. Other stolen items like jewellery were sold to the two women who then passed on the goods further. Police said the gang, which called itself “Devil Angels”, was inspired by Hollywood movies. One of the accused even had the name tattooed on his arm.
 
 A team, led by ACP (Mayur Vihar) Shobhit Saksena, was formed in March. Police suspected the involvement of a few repeat offenders. Local intelligence was developed and active patrolling conducted in the area, police said. The team made a breakthrough on Monday when a man was caught red-handed while breaking open the door of a house in which he had locked himself. He told police that he, along with nine other people, were inspired by the film, “Dhoom”, and also some Hollywood action movies.
 
 Acting on the information from him, several traps were laid in the areas where the gang usually operated. On Tuesday evening, five other members of the gang on two motorcycles were nabbed after a hot chase. They told the cops that they sold the stolen jewellery to two women who were also apprehended later. Around 100gm of gold jewellery was recovered from them. The team also seized five sports motorcycles and other stolen items. 
 
 Police said the gang used to conduct a recce of crowded areas as well as residential places to identify their targets.
