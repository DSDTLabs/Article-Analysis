'Dil Juunglee', a romantic comedy movie starring Taapsee Pannu, Saqib Saleem Abhilash Thapliyal, Nidhi Singh and Srishti Shrivastava, has been written and directed by Aleya Sen.
 
 The first song, ' ' is a typical Tanishk Bagchi number. The remake-composer and hit-maker, has taken the best of two classic love songs and combined them to create this version. 
 
 The prelude and part of the chorus, is strikingly similar to Ellie Goulding’s 'Love Me Like You Do' ('Fifty Shades of Grey' - 2015) and the other song used is 'Gazab Ka Hai Din' from the 1988 superhit 'Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak'. But then this song is a Tanishk number and he has done what he is best at – picked the best music and mixed them to create a soulful, romantic number that will hug at your heartstrings. Sung by Jubin Nautiyal and  , this track is an earworm.
 
 The next track 'Nachle Na' is surely all set to be a party favourite. Sung by Punjabi Singer Guru   (of the 'Ban Ja  ' fame from 'Tumhari Sulu') and Neeti Mohan, and composed by the singer along with Rajat Nagpal, 'Nachle Na' is one of those desi tracks that will have you grooving in no time.
 
 'Beat Juunglee' is slated to be one of the most fun tracks this year, and has been sung by   and Prakriti. Armaan’s nuanced singing with the right intonations adds to this typical dance track. Tanishk and Vayu’s lyrics are youthful and will resonate with youngsters. Overall, this album is worth a hear.
