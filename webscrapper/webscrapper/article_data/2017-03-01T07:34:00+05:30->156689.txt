JALANDHAR: Coming out in support of his   Gurmehar while taking on politicians, especially   Kiren Rijiju,   has asked them what was   that campuses should be safe and there should be no violence there.

 Speaking to a TV channel here on Tuesday at his cabin in the local district administration complex, Capt Mandeep Singh’s father said that his son attained martyrdom on August 6, 1999, and now this was the reward to his family. He also took a dig at the BJP, saying that at that time also it was the BJP government in power and now also the same party is in power and everybody knows what is happening. “At that time they could not even give us the identity cards, showing us as parents of a martyr. And now this is the reward being given to us that his daughter is being threatened,” he continued.
 
 Kanwaljeet held that though he was concerned about the safety of his granddaughter but wondered what worse could happen. “I sacrificed my son and now they want to take my child’s life and will this be something great,” he said while taking a dig at those who had been targeting Gurmehar. “First look at her statement before targeting her,” he advised.
