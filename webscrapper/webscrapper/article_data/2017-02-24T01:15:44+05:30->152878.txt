 Lucknow: Stray animals in the   may soon be a thing of the past. From February 27,   would be starting a rigorous, 12-day stray-catching   during nights.
 
 To be held on priority, the drive would be on till March 10. LMC recently increased the capacity of its biggest animal shelter, Kanha Upvan, in Sarojininagar which would help accommodate more  . The veterinary department would be covering 26 most important police station areas which are more prone to stray cattle-related complaints. 
 
 These include almost all major localities, like Mahanagar, Aashiana, Vikasnagar, Chowk, Daliganj, Indiranagar, Aliganj and Gomtinagar. Arvind Rao, LMC’s veterinary officer, said, “The drive would be held at night, between 10am and 4pm, so as not to inconvenience residents.” 
 
 Though the corporation catches strays on complaints, it has never launched an organised drive till date. LMC estimates around 3,000 stray cattle to be present in the city. Rao said, “Kanha Upvan now has more sheds to accommodate stray animals. While cattle would be caught at night, stray dogs would be nabbed during daytime.” 
 
 Estimates say there are around 59,000 stray dogs in the city, of which 15,000 have been sterilised.
