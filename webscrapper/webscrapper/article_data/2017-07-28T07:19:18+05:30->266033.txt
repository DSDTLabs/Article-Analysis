MUMBAI: Days after special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam completed submissions on why   and conspiracy charges be framed against artist   Upadhyay, the prime accused in a case of double murder of his former wife, artist Hema Upadhyay, and her lawyer Haresh Bhambani, he moved the Bombay high court, pleading that trial court proceedings be stayed and a high-ranking police officer be directed to probe it fairly, terming the present probe as a “sham”. 

 He complained that Mumbai crime branch, which cracked many murder cases including the high-profile J Dey and Esther Anhuya murder cases, was “not fair’’. The session court in Dindoshi is scheduled to hear the defence on framing of charges, the last of the pre-trial steps. Once charges are framed the trial will begin.
 
 Chintan had been seeking three police statement copies of friends and a staff, which he said were key to his defence, but had no success in the trial court as Nikam said they were not being relied on. But Chintan’s lawyer on inspecting the chargesheet said the statements were included in it.
 
 The bodies of Hema and her lawyer were found in a nullah in   on December 11, 2015. Chintan has been in custody since December 22, 2015. More than a year and a half later, he wants the HC to direct an independent probe in the interest of justice, to both, his murdered wife and him.
