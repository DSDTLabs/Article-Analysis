AURANGABAD: Sadhvi   Singh, who is out on bail, said on Monday that she was falsely framed in the  .

 “It was the conspiracy of the disbelievers to coin the term ‘saffron terrorism’ and blot the country’s name at the global stage,” she said.
 
 Pragya was in the city to address a function, ‘Bhagwa rang tyagacha’ (saffron, the colour of sacrifice), organised by a right-wing body at the Sant Tukaram auditorium in memory of Janubhau Ranade and also to mark the birth anniversary of Maratha warrior king Shivaji Maharaj.
 
 Pragya repeatedly said she was falsely framed by the previous government. “It was their conspiracy to put a woman behind bars and forcefully extract statements supporting their theory,” she claimed.
 
 During her address, the sadhvi also praised Prime Minister   for “acche din” and added that if she were asked, she would join politics and serve the country.
 
 Without naming former   (ATS) chief Hemant Karkare, Pragya said she did not consider him to be a martyr. Karkare was killed in the 26/11 terrorist attack in Mumbai.
 
 “Those suppressing nationalists as well as patriots would be killed by terrorists. The example of the same is before all of us in Maharashtra. I don’t believe him to be a martyr. I had nothing to do about it, but it all happened,” she said.
 
 Pragya also appealed to Hindus to have more children. “It is saffron that is appealing to you to have more children for the sake of the country. This is not something which I should be saying, but something you should be thinking about,” she said.
