 There is a huge backlash in Arunachal Pradesh, disrupting normal life, due to the SC direction. There was a total shutdown today , apart from violent reactions from people of the state.
 
 
 Yes, the meeting discussed repercussions of the SC direction and we all agreed that constitutional status and rights of the indigenous Arunachalese tribes should be protected.
 
 
 The original population of Chakmas and Hajongs when they were taken in by the then   government between 1964 and 1969 was 14,888.Now, official figures put their number at 64,000 and unofficially it exceeds 1 lakh. How can we grant citizenship to so many illegal immigrants? How will the state government determine who are the original
 
 
 
 In East Arunachal, where the refugees reside, the population of each indigenous Arunachal tribe is a few thousand. If ChakmasHajongs are given citizenship as permanent residents of Arunachal, the indigenous tribes will be completely outnumbered and become a hopeless minority . Also, the indigenous tribes of Arunachal are listed under constitutional provisions. How can more tribes be added without amending the Constitution? The SC must correct these anomalies.
 
 All Indian citizens other than the Arunachalese need an inner line pass to enter the state while foreigners need a resident area permit. If Chakmas are exempted from ILP rule, there will be major back lash as this will give them a status superior to even regular Indian citizens.
 
 
 
 We will request the court to modify its blanket order for grant of citizenship to Chakmas and Hajongs as permanent residents of Arunachal Pradesh. The modified order must be implementable and not infringe upon constitutional rights of indigenous Arunachal tribes.
 
 
 The two cannot be compared.While Rohingyas' entry into the country was completely illegal, Chakmas and Hajongs were recognised as refugees by the then government.
