PATNA: The alleged   rocked the legislative council on Saturday and absence of   Ashok Choudhary gave opposition a chance to corner the government. 

 Dissatisfied with the reply of in-charge minister, the opposition demanded a proper probe into the scam. It accused the government of allotting tender to same company year after year. The opposition was not even ready to hear the reply of animal husbandry and fisheries minister Awadhesh Kumar Singh, who informed the House that the education minister, who is out of state because of some personal work, has already ordered a probe into the matter.
 
 Former deputy CM and   functionary Sushil Kumar Modi said a particular firm, Puja Printers, was allotted tender for packaging and distribution of books under ‘Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’ for five years – 2010 to 2015. “The tender was finalised at Rs 15 crore and the firm had been awarded the work for five years. However, the tender for 2015-16 for the same work was finalised at Rs 9 crore, which showed there was something wrong with the entire process,” Modi said.
 
 The opposition claimed that owner of the firm was a JD (U) member. However, JD (U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar denied the allegation. 
 
 Modi said the probe should be handed over to another agency as the vigilance department, which initiated the investigation six months back, has so far not been able to come to any conclusion. 
 
 Replying to another question raised by Congress legislator Dilip Kumar Choudhary regarding appointment of Maithili teachers and promotion of this language, which has already been included in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India, Singh said the government was planning to create the post of Maithili teachers in middle schools. BJP legislator Vinodanand Jha also demanded appointment of a Maithili translator in the House so that he can question and answer in Maithili language.
