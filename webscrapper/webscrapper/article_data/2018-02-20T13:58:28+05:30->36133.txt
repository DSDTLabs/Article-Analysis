BHAGALPUR: Police have arrested two criminals on Sunday in connection with the   committed at the Bhagalpur residence of a former circle officer (CO) of Jagdishpur Navin Bhushan Prasad. 

 Police sources said the arrested duo have confessed their crime and said that they were hired by an aggrieved party in connection with a land mutation case, in which an order was recently pronounced by the CO.
 
 The dacoity was committed on February 9 in which jewellery and other belongings worth Rs 15 lakh and cash around Rs 50,000 were looted. Armed miscreants after entering the official’s house first held the family members hostage and snatched their mobile phones.
 
 Bhagalpur   Manoj Kumar has formed a team consisting of town   and SHOs of Ishakchak, Tilkamanjhi, Babarganj, Jgadhishpur police stations to crack the case. “We have arrested two criminals – Sourabh alias   and Sachin alias Shashi Mandal— of the gang involved in the dacoity,” said the SSP adding the looted jewellery and other articles were recovered from the possession of their possesion.
 
 The SSP also said that a dispute related to land mutation between two brothers—Ashok Sah and Biru Sah—both residents of Teenpulia under Jagdishpur block was the reason behind the dacoity. “Prasad had given an order in favour of Biru. This enraged three sons of Ashok— Amit, Anand and Vikas—who wanted to take a revenge. Ashok’s sons conspired with the criminals and plotted the loot,” added the SSP.
 
 Prasad was later transferred to Madhepura.Prasad.
 
 “All three sons of Ashok are absconding but we will arrest them soon,” said the police officer.
