INDORE: Three doctors conducted psychological and physical evaluation of deaf-and-mute girl Geeta here on Thursday following concern over reports of erratic behaviour and refusal of food. 

 Geeta, who was stuck in Pakistan for several years, has been at a state-run hostel in Indore after her return to India in 2015. According to officials, Geeta lost around 3kg weight in the last few days, triggering alarm. Hostel director approached collector  , who ordered a medical check-up.
 
 "Geeta is our responsibility and we ensure she is comfortable. Since we came to know that she has been refusing food for the past two-three days and showing signs of uneasiness, a team of doctors conducted her psychological and physical evaluation," the collector told TOI.
 
 Three doctors from  , administrative officials and an interpreter visited   and spoke to Geeta about the 'behavioural problems' she was facing, said an official. They talked about her learning new things, like writing. During the meet, Geeta expressed her wish to meet external affairs minister   and Bollywood actor Salman Khan, the official added. The team will submit its report to the administration, which will be shared with senior officials to "take best possible decision for Geeta", he said. Geeta is reported to have lost her temper a few times recently and left her hostel once without informing the authorities.
