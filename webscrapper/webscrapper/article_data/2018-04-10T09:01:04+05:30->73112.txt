INDORE: Voter list is being upgraded to remove 6.7 lakh ineligible   and conduct a fair assembly election, chief election commissioner ( ) OP Rawat said on Monday.

 As per the official data, 31,000   are in the district. “Certainly, there are lapses in revision of electoral rolls. After a probe,   names will be removed from the list and new names will be added so that a correct voter list is ready before polls,” Rawat told the media-persons.
 
 He said that the number is quite less and moreover many of them have passed away, but their names had not been deleted from the list.
 
 The voter list will be rectified and suggestions will be taken in this regard from political parties and people concerned, he reiterated.
 
 Rawat said that a process is underway to link Aadhaar number with the individual voter ID card.
 
 When asked about conducting the Lok Sabha and assembly polls simultaneously, he said, “Unless necessary amendments are made in the Constitution and laws, it is not good for us to make any comment on the issue.”
 
 As per the schedule, Rawat gave 15 minutes to the local representatives of seven registered political parties, including the   and Congress.
 
 During the meet, BJP city wing president Kailash Sharma raised the issue of Bangladeshi people getting registered in the voter list. “Many people, who look like Bangladeshi, have got themselves enrolled in the voter list. They can affect the election. The administration should look into the matter and take appropriate action,” Sharma said.
 
 Congress city wing president Pramod Tandon said, “We have raised our concern over EVMs malfunctioning and urged the commission to conduct the election through ballot papers.”
