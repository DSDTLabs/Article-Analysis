THANE: The  's demolition operations will be monitored by civic chief   himself on Friday. Jaiswal will monitor and supervise the drive that will be carried out at seven main as well as arterial roads of the city.

 He will ensure that all the roads are wide enough as mentioned in the city development plan to ease traffic flow in the city.
 
 The drive will be carried out at Noori Baba dargah road, Samata Nagar-33, Mumbra-Kharegaon road, Ram Maruti road in Balkum, RMall to Everest World, Gurukul society road and Grand square to Anand Nagar. The approximate length of the stretch to be widened is 6km and will cost approximately Rs 12 crore.
 
 The arterial roads witness heavy traffic as most of them have been encroached upon by illegal shops. Motorists and pedestrians have a tough time manning these areas. Following repeated complaints to the authorities, the administration has finally included their development in its plan, this year.
 
 The   has been on a road widening spree since last year. Jaiswal has alloca ted Rs 100 crore for strengthening and widening roads this fiscal year under the road development vision plan that was announced by him during the budget.
 
 A review meeting was held by Jaiswal on Thursday evening with officials from all department, including town planning and public works, to execute the road widening plan. "We will be starting work on only three roads on Friday. Some residents from Haridas Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Kalwa, Balkum and Kharegaon have appealed to the administration to defer the action by a fortnight due to the ongoing school and college exams,'' said Ratan Awsarmol, city engineer at the TMC.
