SURAT: Railway traffic was affected at   station after an attachment   of Mumbai-Ahmedabad passenger train derailed while changing track at the washing yard to reach platform number 3 here on Saturday morning. 

 Western Railway (WR) ordered suspension of shunting jamadar Babu K and pointsman Vishnu for negligence in performing their duty. 
 
 Sources said shunting jamadar and pointsman were not present on the spot for manual senting of the track to allow smooth passage to the attachment coach. However, while the train moved ahead, the coach derailed from the track. 
 
 A couple of trains, including Mumbai-bound Flying Ranee and Udhana-Danapura, were late by almost four hours due to derailment of the parcel coach at the washing yard. 
 
 The railway officials said the main line was not affected as derailment occurred on the washing yard track when the attachment train was approaching the main line to connect the coach with Mumbai-Ahmedabad passenger train waiting on the platform number 3.
 
 Sources said the parcel coach left the railway yard at around 5am to be attached to Ahmedabad passenger train on the platform number 3. While changing the track, the coach derailed just a few yards away from the platform. The railway staff immediately rushed to the spot and started the operation to clear the main line. 
 
 Flying Ranee train, which was scheduled to depart from Surat railway station towards Mumbai at 5:30am, was delayed by almost four hours. The Flying Ranee left for Mumbai from Surat at about 9:20am and   for Mumbai at around 9:25am when the latter’s scheduled departure was 7:20am.
 
 “The main line was not affected as derailment of the parcel coach occurred within the washing yard track. Both, Flying Ranee and Udhana-Danapur Express were parked in the washing yard, so they got delayed by a few hours. However, other trains on the main line kept running on time,” a railway officer said.
