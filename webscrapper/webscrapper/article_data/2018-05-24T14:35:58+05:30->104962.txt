COIMBATORE/TIRUPUR: The Class X board examination results came as a blow to the Coimbatore revenue district, which could manage a pass percentage of only 95.86, as its state ranking slipped to 15 from 11 last year.

 However, its neighbouring district   recorded its best performance in three years, albeit by a very small margin. With a pass percentage of 97.18, Tirupur district was placed seventh in the state in churning out Class X winners.
 
 A total of 40,307 students from 520 schools across the Coimbatore revenue district had appeared for the examination held in March. Out of this, 38,638 students have cleared the exams.
 
 Meanwhile, of the 2,8214 students from 336 schools appeared for the exams in Tirupur, 27,418 have emerged successful. Among the 336 schools, 209 have recorded 100% results. Of them, 62 were government schools, 18 aided schools and 122 private schools.
 
 According to P Ayyannan, chief educational officer (CEO), the pass percentage in the Coimbatore revenue district has dropped to 95.86 this year from 96.42 in 2017.
 
 “A meeting is scheduled on Thursday to analyse the reasons for the poor performance and discuss corrective measures,” he said and added that the performance of corporation and municipal schools has come down this year.
 
 While the municipal schools and government schools managed to secure 91.42% and 92.59% pass, respectively, corporation schools cut a poor figure with a pass percentage of just 89.63.
 
 The number of government schools that managed to get centum results has increased from 36 to 40 this year, the CEO said.
 
 “In 2016, the district managed to secure 10th position with a pass percentage of 96.22. Though the pass percentage improved to 96.42 in 2017, the ranking slipped to 11. This year, we fared very poor in both the fronts. The department will take necessary steps for improvement,” Ayyannan said.
 
 However, differently-abled students have made the district proud with a pass percentage of more than 90. Of the 216 such students appeared for the exam, 188 have come out in flying colours. This has helped the district secure 12th rank in the category.
 
 The biggest disappointment was that the number of students with more than 96% marks has come down to 629 from 2,736. Also, the number of students with more than 90% marks has dropped to 3,741 from more than 10,000 students.
 
 Meanwhile, girl students outshone boys in many fronts. At 97.60% pass, girls outnumbered boy students, whose pass percentage was just 94.10%. While 468 girls managed to secure more than 96% marks, only 161 boys could achieve that feet. Also, 2,448 girls managed to secure over 90% marks, against 1,293 boys.
