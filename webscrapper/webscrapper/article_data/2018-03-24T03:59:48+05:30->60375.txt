MUMBAI: Politicians from the Congress-NCP combine led by leader of the opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan and former speaker Dilip Walse-Patil on Friday called on governor   to protest against chief minister   over the manner in which he moved a confidence motion in favour of speaker  . 

 "The resolution moved by Fadnavis was anti-democratic and an attempt to silence the opposition," Vikhe-Patil said after his meeting with the governor. In a memorandum submitted to the governor, the leaders stated that in view of the speaker's "stepmotherly treatment" given to the opposition, a no-confidence motion was filed on March 5. Under the legislature's rules, a no-confidence motion can be taken up for discussion after 14 days, however, when the notice was not taken up, the opposition members brought it to the speaker's notice. The speaker then observed that he would take up the motion at an appropriate time for discussion. "The notice should have been shown on the agenda and a discussion was expected on it," Vikhe-Patil said.
 
 On Friday, suddenly a motion was moved, saying, the "House has confidence in the speaker", while there was no decision on the no confidence motion against the speaker. Fadnavis submitted that on July 26, 2006, a motion was moved to express confidence in the cabinet. "While moving the motion, Fadnavis misled the house. The CM's move is anti-democratic," Vikhe Patil said.
