Chandigarh: The housing problem of Haryana MLAs would soon come to an end with the allotment of 16 more newly-constructed flats, which would be inaugurated on Monday. Twelve flats were inaugurated in March this year at Sector 3, Chandigarh.

 Haryana assembly has 90-MLAs and with new housing units, total number of flats for MLAs would be increased to 66. Two flats have been allotted for running a dispensary for them.
 
 With new flats, most of the MLAs would be accommodated, as several MLAs have been allotted independent houses for being ministers and in other capacity.
 
 The MLAs have been complaining for unavailability of a permanent residence, especially during the assembly session, and were being accommodated at the MLA hostel.
 
 Originally, Haryana was assigned only 38 old flats for the allotment to its MLAs. Considering the residential needs of MLAs, the Haryana government in September 2015, had started construction of 28 more flats at Sector 3, Chandigarh, at the cost of Rs 25 crore. Of these, 16 flats have three storeys and 12 have two storeys.
 
 In March 2016, the state had renovated 40 rooms of MLA hostel in Sector 3, near the flats at the cost of Rs 6.78 crore. The MLAs are entitled for rooms only for specific period, especially during the assembly session.
