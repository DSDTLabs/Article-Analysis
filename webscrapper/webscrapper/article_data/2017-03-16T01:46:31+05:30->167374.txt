The ‘Beauty and the Beast’ actress has been highly upset with her private photos being leaked online. Emma is pursuing a legal action against the invasion of her privacy.
Apalled by the audacity of the hacker, Emma is adamant on taking an action.
 Emma’s spokesperson confirmed that the photos weren’t nudes but of her trying on clothes.
  despite being a UN Women goodwill ambassador, was threatened earlier in 2014 too regarding leaking of some of other explicit photos.
 Emma received flak from critics saying that by exposing her breasts, she’s acting against her feminist values when she posed semi-topless for a shoot for the cover of the magazine Vanity fair. 
 Controversies aside, the beautiful actress will be seen acing the role of Belle in her upcoming movie ‘Beauty and the Beast’.
