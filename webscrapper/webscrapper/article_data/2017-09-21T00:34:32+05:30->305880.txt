NAVI MUMBAI: With international teams set to arrive in Vashi for the   in October, the civic body’s engineering department has started rectifying   on roads leading to the venue. The civic body said the speed-breakers have to be of international standard to prevent inconvenience to international football   going to the practice sessions venue.

 Local residents alleged that all these years NMMC has taken motorists for granted by not providing proper speed-breakers, as their size and height varied at different locations. They damage cars as the speed-breaker humps dents the base.
 
 They said the civic body had taken note of the wrongly constructed speed-breakers only for the   event and it was rectifying them along with beautification work like paining road dividers and cleaning road peripheries on the route to the venue.
 
 NMMC executive engineer (Vashi division) Arvind Shinde said, “The speed-breakers are being reconstructed as per design specifications suggested by Indian Road Congress (IRC). Each speed-breaker has been reshaped with a length of 10 feet, while the height will be four inches, compared to the previous 10-15 feet. The proposal to reconstruct the speed-breakers across the city was in the pipeline for long. It is a coincidence that it is being done when the World Cup is scheduled next month.”
 
 NMMC’s Vashi ward officer Mahendra Singh Thoke said, “Vehicles ferrying international   players will come from Mumbai, and after entering Vashi, they will take the route via Shivaji Chowk till the Noor mosque junction, and then turn left to reach the NMSA venue. On this route and in the vicinity of the venue, six speed-breakers have been reconstructed for a smooth drive for the football players.”
