They said there should not be any concrete construction near the river at all and demanded that the authorities take strict action against those encroaching on the river.
 
 “The Musi River Restoration should be a conservation project with ecological, envi ronmental, social and economic objectives integrated into it,“ said D Narasimha Reddy, advisor, Save Rivers.
 
 Citing examples of the   in Seoul, South Korea, and River Thames, they urged the authorities not to decrease the riverbed in the name of beautification. “River restoration projects ensure wider space for rivers to flow and none of these projects reduced the width of the river,“ said scientist Indrasena T Reddy .
 
 Activists also said animal waste is dumped at Puranapul.“There is a meat market in Puranapul and vendors throw waste into the Musi,“ said Old City resident Roop Darak.
