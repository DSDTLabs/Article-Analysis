 Kumar, a city-based singer, recently charmed all with his mesmerising voice. Starting with Allah ke bande, he went on to render hit numbers like Dil ye ziddi hai, Nahi jeena et al. Just when the audience was getting used to his heart-warming numbers, he got them on their toes with rock versions of Tere liye and Ishq barse. With renditions of Mora piya and a slew of other romantic numbers, Himanshu left the audience asking for more. While Himanshu got busy on stage, many of his young fans were spotted singing along and dancing to his tunes. Even as the evening came to an end, fans were in no mood to head home.
