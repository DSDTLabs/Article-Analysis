Panaji: Handwritten verses penned by the ‘King of Goan comedy’, Jacint Vaz, will now be available to the public. His original works, containing some of his famous songs, which had been preserved by his family were ‘gifted’ to the Goa state central library, in January, for posterity. 

 “Vaz’s original works have been donated to us by his son Peter and these texts contain the lyrics of over 50 songs. They also feature dates and venues of where the respective tiatrs were performed,” said library curator Carlos Fernnades. The handwritten material has been scanned and bound in books for the reference of library members.
 
 The late Vaz was known popularly as the ‘Charlie Chaplin of the Konkani stage’. He is also credited to be the first tiatrist to receive the Goa State Cultural Award for the year 1979-80.
 
 Recently, a statue was erected at his birthplace, Mandur, to commemorate his life and contribution to  .
 
 Earlier, in November 2017, over 70 romantic novels written by renowned Konkani writer Reginaldo Fernandes were also donated to the library by his son Salvador. Known as ‘Romanxincho Patxai’ or the king of fiction novels, Fernandes was among Goa’s older generation of writers that wrote extensively in Romi Konkani. He has nearly 200 romance novels to his credit. A few years back, the Dalgado Konknni Akademi (DKA) honoured Fernandes, on his 101st birth anniversary, by naming its conference hall after him.
 
 “Works of both, Vaz and Fernandes, have heritage value. However, both writers are virtually unknown to the younger generations. Little effort was made in the past to recognize their works. This treasure trove of their literature that we have now is rare, unseen by anyone. This information will enhance the value of research that interested people intend to study.” Fernandes said.
