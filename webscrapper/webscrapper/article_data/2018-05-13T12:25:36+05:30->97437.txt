THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: While the state government would be relieved over the fact that new information commissioners have sworn-in after a long gap, the state information commission ( ) has not been able to dispose of even half the number of petitions received during the past five years. 

 
 The pendency of petitions received at SIC has been so high that as on March 31, 2018, 14,990 cases remain undisposed with appeal petitions numbering 10,722 and complaint petitions at 4,268. The analysis of figures shows that the first five years of SIC were exemplary for the state with the commission recording 100% disposal rate of petitions between 2006-2011. 
 
 The commission began losing its way from 2012 when over 600 appeal petitions out of 2,702 could not be disposed in the year. The pending files kept on piling up from 2013 and the sluggishness was most reflected in disposal of appeal petitions. The percentage of disposal could hardly reach 50% since 2013 for appeal petitions. In 2014 only 1,217 out of 3,326 files could be disposed of and in 2016, the commission received 2,810 appeal petitions and it cleared just 1,190 petitions. 
 
 "The absence of commissioners may not be the only reason for such severe backlog. It has always been a case of political appointments and hence there has been an evident lack of commitment, which results in such high pendency of petitions in Kerala," said  , state co-ordinator of the National Campaign for People's Right to Information ( ). 
 
 "When petitions do not get cleared for four years, people lose faith in the  's power. Another effect is that even the public information officers take the liberty to deny information because they don't have to face penalty in a state with such high pendency," he said. Even the number of information officers who have been awarded penalty for denial of information between 2016 and 2017 is 559, a number which could have been higher had the clearance rate for petition been high in the state. 
 
 Between 2016 and 2018, when the SIC remained a single-man body, the pendency touched an all-time high. In 2017, only 367 appeal petitions were disposed out of 2,832 petitions and the backlog kept getting bigger for complaint petitions as well. 
 
 In 2018, the total number of petitions, which have been cleared until March 31 was just 3 when the number of petitions received was 1,034. 
 
 Chief information commissioner  , who has singlehandedly run the commission from May 2016 cleared 3,632 appeal petitions and 848 complaint petitions between May 2016-March 2018. 
 
 "The first challenge was to clear the pendency with chief information commissioner. Once that was done, the attention was on clearing files with other commissioners which had been pending since 2011. Files were being cleared at a rate of 50% from 2017 and 50% from 2011. There were also efforts to clear pending files in other years between 2011 and 2017," said Paul.
 
  While time-limits have been prescribed in the RTI Act for furnishing information for public information officers and first appellate authorities, the act has been silent on time-limit for disposal of petitions for state information commission.
