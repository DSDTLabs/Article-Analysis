HYDERABAD: Chief minister   ripped into Congress, terming the party as “villain No 1” for Telangana. Ironically, as all the Congress members were facing suspension, there was no MLA from the opposition party to listen and respond to the CM’s charges. “Right from the time   was Prime Minister, only injustice was done to   by the Congress,” he said.

 Chandrasekhar Rao issued a stern warning to the Congress which, he said, is trying to block development of Telangana by filing cases against irrigation projects.
 
 “Even after the expulsions and suspensions, they do not seem to regret what they did in the  . From the video the footage, severe action (expulsions) of two more members could take place,” the chief minister said, without giving names. Reacting to the opposition’s cries charge that the governor had read out what the government had wanted, the CM said: “Yes. Governor should read out only what the state government writes.” There is only truth in the governor’s speech, he said.
 
 Describing the bus yatra by the Congress as a flop show, the CM said he knew before the Congress wanted to stay away from the Assembly and that is why indulged in ruckus.
 
 While he attacked the Congress, TDP MLA R Krishnaiah, who later spoke in a different context, had a piece of advice for the CM.   raised the issue of protests not being allowed in the city. “You created history by achieving Telangana, but you should also allow dissent,” he said. “Will a mother chide her child if he/she cries for milk? She will feed the baby. That is how the CM should be,” he said.
