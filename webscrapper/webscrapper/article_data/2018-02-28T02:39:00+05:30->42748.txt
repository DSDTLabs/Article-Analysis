Tiruvuru: Many parents staged a protest against the authorities of Nagarjuna Merit School, Tiruvuru after a five-year-old student was allegedly thrashed by a teacher. Lalitha , a teacher of the school was alleged to have beaten up Sk Hafeez, a UKG student as he was not paying heed to lessons in the class on Monday. 

 The boyâ€™s parents found blood stains in his shirt after he came back from the school. They also spotted bruises on the back of the child, which might have been caused by a wooden ruler or cane. When the parents confronted with the school management on Tuesday, the latter refused to take any action against the accused teacher. However, another incident of corporal punishment was reported from the same school earlier, when Ramesh, a social science teacher, allegedly had thrashed two class six students, Guduru Venkat and Narasimha Reddy. 
 
 As the school authorities turned down to accept the incident, many parents staged the protest outside the school, demanding action against the school management. Later, police from Tiruvuru calmed down the situation. The angry parents lodged a complaint with the police against the teacher and cops registered a case. TNN
