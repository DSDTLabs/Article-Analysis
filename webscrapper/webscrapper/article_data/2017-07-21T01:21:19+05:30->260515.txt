NEW DELHI: Missing the last Metro to Rajiv Chowk on July 6 was the beginning of  . What followed was a fortnight-long trauma during which he travelled more than 500 kilometres and was kept at six different places. The kidnappers even celebrated his birthday and gifted him a pair of black shades.

  had come to Delhi in 2015 after completing his MBBS from a university in Shanghai. He had joined a private hospital in Preet Vihar as a resident doctor and was preparing for his MD. “I wish to forget it as a bad   of my life,” he said.
 
 The 29-year-old said that he had panicked when the cabbie locked the doors of the WagonR and started driving in the wrong direction. He couldn’t put up much resistance due to his small stature and language barrier.
 
 “The kidnappers initially thrashed him, but later assured to let him go once they received the ransom money,” said Sudhakar, Goud’s uncle.
 
 The victim said that he doesn’t remember anything between July 10 and 19 as he was kept blindfolded, taken to different places and locked up in rooms. He rarely responded to the kidnappers if they tried to strike a conversation. He spent most of the days either sleeping or lying down.
 
 On Wednesday, the gunshots in Shatabdi Colony were welcome a sound to Goud. When the cops entered the room where he had been confined, he hugged them and cried. “I can’t thank Delhi Police enough for saving my life,” he said.
 
 “We are relieved on the safe return of Dr Srikanth Goud from the hands of the kidnappers. We will continue to cooperate with the police in their investigations to ensure that the culprits are brought to justice. We will also support the family to help them fully recover from the aftershocks of this harrowing crime,” said an Ola statement.
