It has been two years since he marked his debut in Bollywood, but   would rather wait for the right project than repeat himself. While the actor’s first film was a fantasy romantic thriller, his second outing — '  Superhero' — will see him playing a masked vigilante.

 Meanwhile, Harshvardhan told BT that he is also looking forward to the sports biopic on Olympic champion shooter,  . He said, “After Bhavesh Joshi..., I will take a break in June, and from July onwards, I will start prepping for the sports biopic. The film will go on floors in November.” The movie, Harshvardhan says, is special to him for another reason. “For this movie, Abhinav has given me the   with which he won the Olympic gold (in Beijing, in the Men’s 10-Metre Air Rifle category) and that’s a huge source of inspiration for me.”
 
 Ask him if he is careful about his choice of films and he replies, “Mirzya, Bhavesh Joshi... and the   are three different films. In fact, I don’t know how much business my upcoming films will do. I don’t approach my work keeping box office in mind. Maybe that’s naïve or even wrong, but that’s who I am. I have learnt from my father (Anil Kapoor) that if you work with sincerity, somewhere, it reaches somebody and over a period of time, they realise what you are trying to do.”
