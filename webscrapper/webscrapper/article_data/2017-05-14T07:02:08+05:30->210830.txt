CHENNAI: An eight-year-old girl   during a summer   at a   in   on Saturday, police said.

 While a postmortem report of Andrea Biju, conducted at Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital (KMCH), said death occurred due to water getting into her lungs, her parents told doctors that she had no pre-existing medical condition.
 
 Andrea, a Class II student of a private school, had enrolled 15 days ago in the camp, said a police officer. On Saturday, the 12th day of the camp being organised in a facility opposite the   Police station, she was at the edge of the pool when she found it difficult to breathe and held on to the railings, he said.
 
 She soon swooned and her father Biju, an assistant film director, and her coach lifted her out. She was rushed to a private hospital where she was declared brought dead. The body was sent to KMCH for an autopsy and was handed over to the family. 
 
 The J J Nagar police registered a case under CRPC 174 (suspicious death). The girl’s parents did not file any complaint against the pool authorities, police said. The organisers of the camp could not be reached for comment.
 
 J J Nagar inspector   said there were 11 children in the pool at the time with their parents moving around, seeing them swim.
 
 After the incident, some parents seemed worried and took their children home, while others appeared anxious about going ahead with the camp.
 
 “When we enroll our children at a swimming camp the organisers should ensure there is zero negligence. These days such camps, including swimming sessions, are being organised to make a fast buck,” said a parent on condition of anonymity.
