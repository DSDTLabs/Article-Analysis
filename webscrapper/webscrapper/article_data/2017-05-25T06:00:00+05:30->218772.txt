Did Shruti Haasan’s   outing have a touch of romance to it? Well, we couldn’t help thinking that looking at this picture Shruti shared on her microblog recently where she is seen with acclaimed English novelist and author  . However, what caught our attention was the presence of her rumoured boyfriend, the London-based actor, Michael 
Corsale who is also seen in the picture. “The best of Cannes — getting to hang with my most favourite writer @neilhimself (sic)”, wrote Shruti. 
 That’s not all though. Her father   also shared the picture on his microblog and captioned it, “My baby in Cannes with her other hero. Neil Gaiman. Glad to be in August company (sic)”. Hmm! Is there something more to the “rumoured relationship” than what meets the eye? Just saying...
