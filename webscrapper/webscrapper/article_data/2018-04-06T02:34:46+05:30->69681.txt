NEW DELHI: Senior leaders of Delhi  , along with party workers, staged a   in front of the assembly against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and the government over the ration   reported by the CAG report.

 Delhi BJP general secretary Rajesh Bhatia, who led the protest, said that it is very unfortunate that though the people of Delhi had given a massive mandate to Kejriwal with the hope of change in political and administrative system, the government is looting the   of the common man.
 
  “BJP will not only expose the misdeeds of this government but also try its best to ensure that Kejriwal is punished by law,” said Bhatia.
 
 BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi said that it is very sad that the ration meant for the poor given by the Centre was diverted to the ration mafia connected with Arvind Kejriwal government. “During the last three years, the Kejriwal government has indulged in the bungling of about Rs 5,400 crore of ration and now when he is being exposed, he is making baseless hue and cry,” said Lekhi.
 
 BJP has demanded CBI or judicial inquiry against Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi government. 
 
 “Through various forums like legislative assembly, BJP has always been saying that the Kejriwal government is committing bungling not only in the supply of ration to the poor but also in the SC/ST development fund and scholarship to the students. The CAG has exposed this fact,” said Vijender Gupta, leader of opposition.
 
 He added that the CAG report made it clear that the Kejriwal government has betrayed the people of Delhi with respect to providing basic amenities like health, education, sports development and ration and also paralysed the services provided by the DTC and Ayush.
