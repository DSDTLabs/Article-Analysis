MUMBAI: Three days after India introduced a   for disruptive passengers,   had the first case of an unruly passenger on board on Monday. However, the airline hasn’t commented on whether it would begin a probe to decide whether to put the passenger on its no-fly list.

 Soon after IndiGo   6E 394 landed around 7.15pm, called CISF security personnel and took the unruly passenger to the airport police station. En route, the passenger, Rinki Thakur, had reportedly misbehaved with the crew. “She turned aggressive, refused to follow the instructions of the cabin crew,” said an airport source. 
 
 The IndiGo crew filed a complaint and police registered a non-cognizable offence. “She was rude and abusive towards the cabin crew. But she didn’t assault anyone. She was sent off with a warning,” said a police officer. The case was filed under IPC Section 504 which deals with intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace.
 
 IndiGo spokesperson didn’t respond to a query sent by TOI on whether the airline planned to begin the process for putting Thakur on the no-fly list. Under the new guidelines introduced by the civil aviation ministry, the pilot-in-command can report an unruly passenger to the airline’s internal panel which should investigate it within 30 days of the incident. If the committee fails to conclude the probe within the deadline, the passenger cannot be banned for that particular case. An airline may impose a ban even as probe is on. But other domestic carriers won’t be bound by the no-fly list of an airline.
