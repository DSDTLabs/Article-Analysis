 Addressing industrialists, she said industrialists should contribute their might to maintain cleanliness and create a clean atmosphere in Goa. 
 
 “Cleanliness has always been part of our tradition and has played an important role in every person’s life. Goa should become the cleanest state of India and act as a role model to other,” she said.
