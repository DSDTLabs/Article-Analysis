LUDHIANA: To effectively monitor the nutrition supply being given to the children in   centres, the ministry of women and child development would hand over smartphones to   of Punjab for ‘instant reporting’ on a daily basis. Apart from this, officials at districts and block levels would get tabs to supervise the functioning of Anganwari workers and centres.

 Ludhiana has 2,487 Anganwari centres in its 16 blocks that include four urban and 12 rural blocks.
 
 Divulging more details, district programme officer   said this would help them to evaluate the performance of the Anganwari workers under the scheme by getting information on whether the recommended diet is being given to the children at the centres. Initially, the four districts including Ludhiana, Sri Muktsar Sahib, Mansa and Faridkot have been selected under Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) for the pilot project by the ministry of women and child development, where Anganwari workers would get the smartphones having common application software (CAS) in it. 
 
 Kaur also said, CAS would have two applications that include   and Supervisor Application. Aanganwari Worker Application will function in smartphones and supervisor application will run on tabs. The Anganwari workers would enter the details including the number of children, their health status including weight, nutrient supply in the diet being given to them daily and their seniors would keep an eye on them through tabs.
 
 She also said that it would also give prompt reporting about nutrient supply to the children and their health updates. Hence, it would be easy to identify the malnourishment among children and special emphasis can be given on them by our teams. This upgradation of the system would help to get real-time reports from the grassroots level.
