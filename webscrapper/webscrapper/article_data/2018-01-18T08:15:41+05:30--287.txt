CHANDIGARH: Stating that the clean chit given by Narang commission to Punjab power and irrigation minister   and later his resignation has exposed the working of friendly commissions instituted by the   government, SAD on Wednesday raised the demand for disbanding of other two commission headed by Justices   (retd) and   (retd).

 Former minister and SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia said the sacking order given to Punjab power minister by the Congress high command after finding he was complicit in getting sand mining contracts allotted to his minions had rubbished the findings of the Justice Narang commission. “We have been continuously stating that the Narang commission was instituted to give a clean chit to Rana. We stand vindicated even as the commission as well as the Congress government stands exposed before the people.”
 
 Majithia alleged that just as the Narang commission was formed with a per-meditated goal, the script of which was written in advance by the Congress government. Similarly, the Ranjit Singh and MS Gill commissions were formed to implicate SAD in incidents of sacrilege as well as blame it for registering false cases against Congressmen.
 
 “They are not commissions but personal fiefdoms. We demand immediate disbanding of both. These should be replaced by an inquiry by a sitting judge of   judge, who should go into all sacrileges committed during the last 10 months of Congress tenure as well as false cases registered against Akali leaders and workers by the Congress government.”
