The launch of this salon saw Chennai’s fashionable peeps turning up for the event. The salon was launched by actor-couple Sneha and Prasanna. Sneha ditched her ethnic avatar and wore a wrap-top that she paired with floral tights. Don’t miss the ‘love’ brooch on her top. Prasanna kept it casual in a grey tee.   There was also a fashion show. In keeping with the Valentine’s Day theme, models strutted the ramp in clothes that had all hues and shades of red. We also spotted Mr India World 2014 (2nd Runner-Up) Bharat Raj looking macho in his casual avatar. Janani Iyer looked cutesy in a red dress!
