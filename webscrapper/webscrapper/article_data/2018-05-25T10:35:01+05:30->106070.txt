JAIPUR: The   (JDA) will withdraw all orders including demolition and cancellation of building layout plans of two buildings near state hangar that were allegedly posing threat to the VIP security. Reason: The law department has suggested   to withdraw these orders to avoid legal tangles during acquisition process of these buildings.

 
 The threat alarm was raised after Prime Minister   visited Jaipur in 2015. Following the state government directions, the JDA issued notices to demolish and reduce the height of these buildings to less than 15 meters. However, the developers challenged the notices in the high court and stay was given on the demolition.
 
 Also, against all JDA orders the court had given interim orders in favour of developers, who were the petitioners. Sources in the JDA said, after the interim orders, it was decided to acquire the land of these buildings.
 
 The district collector has initiated the process for the same. “The petitions are still pending in the court and interim orders are effective. The JDA also faced content of court as attempt to take action against the developers was made despite the interim orders. Now, the additional advocate general has recommended to withdraw all the previous notices that were issued by JDA in February, June and July. This would save JDA from contempt and legal tangles,” said a source.
 
 Last year, the   (UDH) department had sent a proposal to the district administration to acquire these buildings. A senior official of   department said, “After receiving the compensation estimate, a meeting will be chaired by the chief secretary to decide on the civic body that will provide the compensation.”
 
 According to UDH sources, the finance department had earlier wanted the JDA to be spared of the additional burden as the matter related to the civil aviation department. However, it has not been decided if the compensation will be provided by some other government body other than the JDA.
