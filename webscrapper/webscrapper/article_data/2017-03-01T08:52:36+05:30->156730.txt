Two   were mugged at the   of   recently. A  , Christine Soerensen, and her Swiss friend Daniel Wailer were walking down a road when the attacker on a bike snatched   and fled, injuring her in the process.
 
 The incident took place last Thursday around 7.45 pm when the two were on their way to the Swiss Consul General’s house in Raj Mahal Vilas (RMV) Extension. Acco­rding to the complaint, the man sped up to them on his bike and grabbed her bag. While Soerensen held on to her bag, Wailer tried to stop him. But the man didn’t let go of the bag and Soerensen was dragged and injured in the struggle. Eventually, he managed to slip away with her bag, which had her pho­ne, passport, debit cards and cash, among other valuables.
 
 The incident is significant, considering that Sadashivanagar and RMV Extension are two neighbourhoods assumed to be among the most secure because of their many affluent and influential residents. Several VIPs – including politicians, film stars and business tycoons – live in these areas that have well-lit, wide roads and high security.
 
 The incident, however, is not an exception. Last month, in the same neighbourhood, at Ashwatha Nagar junction, a 23-year-old man was strategically robbed by two bike-borne men. They made him crash into a pole and left. And even with a patrolling Hoysala nearby – which had stopped by briefly before heading off – the two men came back, robbed and assaulted him while he waited for help.
 
 “We have managed to get some CCTV footages of this bike. It’s a black Pulsar,” said Chandra Gupta, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central), adding that they were confident of nabbing the guy soon. 
 
 A case has been registered in this regard.
