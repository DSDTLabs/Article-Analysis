BENGALURU: As   becomes popular in India, not only are big players like  ,  , and   investing in it, so are a host of startups.

 The broadcasting and technology business's terminology for it is over-the-top (OTT) content -Â­ delivery of audio and video content over the internet without a multiple-system operator (like a cable or DTH operator) controlling or distributing the content.
 
 Consulting firm Frost and Sullivan estimates there are 66 million unique video viewers in India, and 1.3 million OTT paid video subscribers. That's a big market.
 
  analytics firm Tracxn estimates there are at least 40 new ventures in the space, and around $30 million have been invested by venture capital firms into some of them. Many focus on short videos. It is easy now to showcase such videos under categories like comedy that have cat videos or baby videos, or cars & bikes or style & beauty tips.
 
 Mumbai-based Dekkho provides short videos of 2 to 45 minutes, from 22 content providers. Founder Vinay Pillai, whose experience includes working for Drama Fever, a video streaming website for Korean shows, in New York, has raised $2 million from angel investors. The platform is ad supported. Pillai says subscriptions may work for long form content, but for ad support, "we need to keep it short."
 
 Veqta is an OTT platform for live sports content. It launched a free beta app last August, and will formally launch as a pure subscription platform in March. It has raised $500,000 from venture capital firm Chatsworth Management and sports management company ITW Consulting.
 
 Founder Varun Mathur says live content has the advantage that there are not enough rights available in the market for sports. "We get the feed from partners like ATP and WTA. So it all boils down to who gets the rights first. Also, while movies and music can be sold on a non-exclusive basis, sports can be sold only exclusively," he says.
