LUDHIANA: Ahead of summer, Congress   Sanjay Talwar has raised a demand for two   for localities falling in East constituency. During summer, chances of fire incidents increase, and since there are many industrial and commercial units in the constituency, the MLA wrote a letter to Local Bodies minister   for establishing fire stations in the constituency, for which land is available.

 Already, industrialists in Gehlewal had raised a similar demand last year, and they were ready to provide infrastructure and fire tenders for the fire station. The industrialists rued that a few major fire incidents had been reported on Rahon Road in the past too, but until fire tenders reached the site, the fire almost covered the entire factory or industrial unit. Therefore, there was need to set up a separate fire station on this road.
 
 Talwar said he had raised the demand for at least two fire stations in his constituency, which would be able to cover many areas. He said vacant land belonging to   and   ( ) was available, and the fire department could select suitable land for the purpose.
