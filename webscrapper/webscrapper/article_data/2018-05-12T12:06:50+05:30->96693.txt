RANCHI: The Jharkhand High Court on Friday granted provisional bail of six weeks to RJD president   on medical grounds. 

 Lalu got the bail for treatment of his major illnesses related to the heart and kidneys at specialized medical centres in the country. "The provisional bail will be effective from the time when Lalu is released," said  , the former Bihar chief minister's lawyer.
 
 Lalu is in judicial custody after his sentencing in four fodder scam cases related to fraudulent withdrawal of funds from Dumka, Deoghar and Chaibasa treasuries. He was granted a three-day parole by the Jharkhand government on Thursday to attend his son's marriage in Patna on Saturday. 
 
 Granting the bail, Justice   said life was important for any person, whether a convict or a common citizen.
