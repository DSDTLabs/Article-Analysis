PUNE: More rockfall areas where landslides could take place in the monsoon in the Bor ghat section of the Pune-Mumbai expressway have been identified by   ( ). 

 Additional works amounting to Rs64 crore would be taken up during the monsoon at one location near Adoshi, three locations near  , one on the Khandala-Mumbai corridor, and one at Bhatan tunnel. 
 
 Rockfall mitigation work is being carried out in Adoshi, Khandala and Amrutanjan bridge. 
 
 There were at least four landslides in 2015, one of them fatal. The rock bolting taken up after these landslides ensured an episode-free monsoon in 2016.
 
 In 2004, after an unusually large number of landslides, the corporation took preventive steps. A study by the   recommended landslide protection measures like steel cable nets. The expressway and the Mumbai-Pune national highway merge near Adoshi tunnel and separate at Khandala tunnel. There are six lanes from Adoshi tunnel to Khandala exit. While there is a steep gradient in the ghat stretch, rockfalls have been occurring because of heavy traffic and unstable strata. 
 
 Senior MSRDC officials said one or two lanes will be closed when the additional rock bolting work begins. The corporation has invited bids which would be opened in May. Officials could not say how much work has been completed at Adoshi, Khandala and near Amrutanjan bridge. 
 
 There were four landslides from June 2015 to August 2015. The landslide near Adoshi tunnel killed three persons travelling in a car on July 19. 
 
 Immediate steps were taken in association with Geological Survey of India and IIT Bombay. The GSI identified eight landslide-prone areas. The corporation has used heavy high tensile nets or gabions which are cages engineered from hexagonal woven steel wire mesh to hold the rock face.
