HYDERABAD: The recent suicide of a resident doctor at the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (Nims) has opened a can of worms with several resident doctors now coming forward to speak about the rampant incidences of harassment that takes places across medical colleges and hospitals in the state. Use of abusive language, threatening, intimidation and wrongful blaming, they say, are commonplace.

 
 
  
 
 
 Even last year, a PG resident doctor from the Guntur Medical College’s obstetrics and gynaecology department committed suicide citing ‘harassment’.
 
 “There are a lot of issues, but most of them do not get highlighted and are taken care of internally at the department level. We are aware of incidents and cases where residents have been harassed but nobody has forward to register a complaint for fear of a backlash,” said Dr  , president,  .
 
 “Profanity, name calling and yelling in front of patients is very common. In fact, resident doctors also bear the brunt of mistakes made by other people including consultants and lab technicians. If for instance an MRI surgical profile is to be submitted in the morning and is not ready, the resident gets yelled at, even if he/she is not at fault,” said Dr P S  , president, Telangana Junior Doctors Association.
