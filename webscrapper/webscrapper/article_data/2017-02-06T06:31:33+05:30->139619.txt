HYDERABAD: A day after a Hyderabadi youth’s travails in Saudi Arabia were reported in these columns, the   sprung into action and started making attempts to trace the 22-year-old, Taufeeq of Rasoolpura in Begumpet. 

 On their Twitter handle ‘India in Saudi Arabia’, which operates from Riyadh, the   said they spoke to Taufeeq’s family in Begumpet and took his details. They also activated their counterparts in Doha, Qatar, to join them in their search for the Hyderabad youth. An Indian immigrant in Saudi Arabia had sent a link of the TOI story to the Twitter handle, which resulted in a series of actions.
 
 As there was no action from the Hyderabad police against Santosh Nagar-based agent Imtiyaz, who cheated Taufeeq by turning him into a slave without proper food and third-degree treatment rather than placing him as an office boy job, the Embassy stepped in and in another Tweet stated that they alerted the office of the director-general of police to take action against the culprit. Meanwhile, Taufeeq’s family members went to the Begumpet police station on Sunday and met inspector G Jagan, who promised to take action against the erring agent. He called Imtiyaz to the station. And there, he directed him to call up Saudi Arabia-based agent Ali. However, Ali, after speaking with the inspector for a brief while, cut the call. 
 
 The Begumpet police have pulled up Imtiyaz, but they have not registered any first information report (FIR) against him despite the family members informing them about cheating Taufeeq. Police inturn have asked Imtiyaz to take up the issue seriously and facilitate Taufeeq’s return. Despite repeated attempts,   did not answer the phone. 
 
  After nearly two months, the family on Sunday breathed a sigh of relief after the   reacted to the plight of their son.
