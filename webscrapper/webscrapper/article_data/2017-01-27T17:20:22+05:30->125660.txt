Every time   and   has teamed up, their movies have turned out to be hits. After their collaboration in Classmates, Robin Hood and Ayalum Njanum Thammil, the duo will once again share screen space in the upcoming Jinu Abraham directorial, Adam.

  Similar to their previous ventures, Narain will portay Prithviraj's close friend named Cyriac in the movie, set in Scotland and Kerala. Jinu tells us, 'Prithvi's character Adam, and Cyriac studied together in CMS College in Kottayam before they went separate ways. Adam comes across Cyriac when he travels to Scotland, and he helps him in his journey.'
 
 Narain, who was last seen in Kavi Uddheshichathu..? says that he will join the sets of the movie in mid-February. 'I have only a few portions in Kerala as my character is settled in Scotland, where most of my scenes with Prithvi will be shot,' he explains.
 
  The actor says that his character is 'good-natured' and hence has many contacts who help Adam throughout the story. Incidentally, the duo was supposed to team up for a movie last year. 'There was film in the offing that I couldn't take up due to prior commitments. But in this movie I have a meaty role and lengthy screen time. Like our previous films, I am sure this would also do well as it's got an engaging storyline,' he says. Apart from Prithviraj and Narain, Adam will have their Robin Hood co-star Bhavana in a pivotal role.
 
 Meanwhile, Narain is currently all set to shoot for a Tamil movie titled Othaikku Othai, which has Atharvaa in the lead.
 'It's an extended cameo and my character appears in the flashback sequence in the film. I play a campus hero ' he's got a romance track and backstory that adds to the main plot,' says Narain.
