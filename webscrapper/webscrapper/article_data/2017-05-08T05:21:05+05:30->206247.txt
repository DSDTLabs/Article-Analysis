NAVI MUMBAI: The monitoring committee of eco-sensitive zone at   will recommend to the ministry of environment and forests to bar horse rides on two road stretches of Matheran hill station - MG Road and the stretch between Regal Hotel and Tapal Peti naka. Besides, the tractor service for lifting of garbage is likely to resume after years, if the ministry gives it nod. 

 Further, the long pending environment-friendly alternative transport system proposal is under consideration of the committee. The recently formed committee held a meeting on Saturday.
 
 Chief officer of Matheran Hill Station  , Sagar Gholap, said, "Horse rides pose a nuisance on the two stretches - MG Road and the area between Tapal Peti naka and Regal Hotel. Hence, it has been recommended that horse rides be banned on these roads." He clarified that horse-riding enthusiasts can use the other alternative parallel roads to reach the market.
 
 Gholap said that the municipality has sought the committee's approval to resume tractor service to lift garbage. "Discontinuation of this service is forcing the council to spend more on wet garbage transportation to its bio-gas plant," said Gholap.
 
 Activist Sunil Shinde had given a presentation seeking an alternative transport system like e-rickshaws, highlighting the plight of children, the elderly and tourists at the hill station. 
 
 Head of the committee, Vasudev Gorde, said that demands for a ban on horse rides on the two roads and resumption of tractor service will be recommended to the ministry. "E-rickshaws is a long-pending demand. The committee will decide soon," he said.
