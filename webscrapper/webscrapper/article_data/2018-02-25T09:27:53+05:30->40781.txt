PATIALA: The project to shift dairies from the city to   village is hanging fire as the   municipal corporation (MC) is yet to get the project approved by the government. MC has now again initiated its efforts to get the Detailed Project Report (DPR) approved. Earlier, the MC had failed to include the project in the master plant of the city that was sent for the approval to the government a few months back. 

 The project is hanging fire since 2003 when then   government under Captain   had planned to shift all the dairies from the interiors of the city to Ablowal village. The SAD-BJP government also failed in materialising the project in its ten-year tenure. 
 
 Owners of the dairies in city are looking for a permanent solution to the issue of lack of grazing space for their cattle. Dumping of cattle dung in the city's seasonal rivulets often result in blocked sewers and waterlogging, which increases during the monsoons, adding to the woes of the city residents.
 
 Under the project, hundreds of dairy animals will be shifted to outskirts of the city. There are around 129 large dairies with each consisting over 10 dairy animals while there are over 100 dairies, each consisting of three to five animals. The MC had marked 21 acres of land for the project in Ablowal village where over 200 plots have been marked to shift the dairies. These plots will be provided common facilities like biogas plant, sewerage treatment plant and a veterinary hospital to the dairy owners at a minimal cost.
 
 Patiala superintendent, municipal corporation, M M Sial said, "We have already submitted the DPR and after the CM approves it, we will act on it. The tenders will be floated once the meeting of the   (Puda) officials and town planning is held with the CM."
