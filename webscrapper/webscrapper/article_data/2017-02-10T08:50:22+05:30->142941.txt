BHOPAL: Justice  , who is probing into the jailbreak and subsequent encounter of 8 SIMI men, will take a salary of meagre Re 1 per month. This is the second such probe where Justice Pandey is taking only Re 1 per month as salary. 

 Earlier also when he was heading the judicial probe commission for Ratangarh temple stampede tragedy, he took a salary of just Re 1 per month. The order in this regard was issued by the   (GAD) on February 8 after Justice Pandey expressed his willingness to the department to take only Re 1 as salary for the probe. All other basic facilities like accommodation and conveyance vehicle will also be provided by the government during the tenure of the commission. The order of the GAD says, “A salary of Re 1 per month will be payable to Justice SK Pandey during the tenure of the probe commission.”
 
 The commission was constituted by the state government on November 7, 2016, and it was to submit its probe report in three months. However, as the three months’ time was ending on February 6, the state government extended its tenure in light of the elaborate nature of the commission’s work to another six months. The commission that started working on December 5, 2016, has completed significant part of its investigations. The government had announced the judicial commission headed by Justice (retd) SK Pandey five days after eight alleged   were killed in an encounter following their escape from   on the night of October 30 last year. The government issued the notification two days later, on November 7.
