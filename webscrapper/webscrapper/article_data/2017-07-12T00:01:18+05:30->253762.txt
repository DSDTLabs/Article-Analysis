Kolhapur: The Kolhapur division of public works department (PWD) has completed the work to install   alert system (BAS) on 26 bridges in the district.

 Earlier this year, the state government had floated the idea to install the   system after 20 people lost their lives owing to the washing away of a British-era bridge located on river Savitri. The device has been developed by the IT cell of the PWD department based in Nagpur.
 
 S S Salunkhe, superintendent engineer of the PWD, said, “Installation work has been completed and devices have been activated. The system will automatically blink red light once the bridge is flooded. The government had sanctioned funds for procuring the devices. The light can be seen from a distance and can help commuters to stop using the bridge during floods.”
 
 Earlier, the plan was to install the alert system on 16 bridges. However, the number increased after the demand from local offices grew. Such devices will be installed at around 600 bridges across the state. The alert system is equipped with a mobile that will send text messages to the controlling office of PWD and disaster management office of the district administration.
 
 Each device costs Rs 64,000 and authorities claim that the division is probably the first in the state to complete the task of installing the alert system.
 
 Meanwhile, the department has sent a proposal of Rs 11 crore to repair the old bridges. The plan was to repair the bridges before monsoon, but the compilation of report delayed the process.
 
 The PWD officials expect the plan to be scrutinised and funds released in next couple of months. The department carried out the structural audit of 45 bridges and maintained that 17 of them are safe, while the rest needs minor repairs.
