Aurangabad: While the state government, district administration and people in general have come out in support of the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, local corporators also play an active part in the crisis that the city is facing.

 BJP leader Pramod Rathod agreed that corporators have a key responsibility in ensuring that their wards are disposing waste as per norms.
 
 He claimed that if survey of wards and their progress in waste management is conducted, it will be clear which party is lagging behind.
 
 Rathod said, “The local party leaders should step in and the issues of corporators should be heard and addressed.”
 
 Two years ago, when citywide solid waste management campaign was initiated many wards had responded well. However, due to the apathetic attitude of corporators their wards have now slipped back into their old ways.
 
 Shiv Sena leader Makarand Kulkarni said that the party leadership has clearly outlined that every ward must achieve 100% segregation at source and should process wet waste through composting.
 
 “It is the responsibility of corporators to identify open spaces within the ward and convince people to compost. If everybody cooperates, we can solve this problem in a month’s time,” said Kulkarni
 
 He added that in one to one and a half months all corporators should be able to comply with the norms.
 
 MIM group leader Firoz Khan feels that the purchase of processing machines, public bins and hiring private agencies for spreading awareness can improve the situation.
 
 Khan said, “In zones 1, 2 and 3, which is the old city there is a lack of open spaces. We are brainstorming to figure out where we can dispose the waste.”
