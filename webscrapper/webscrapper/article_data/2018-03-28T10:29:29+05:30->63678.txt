PUNE: Rajendra Chauhan returns to his Vadgaonsheri home from his job at a call centre in Vimannagar in the wee hours of the day, and has always been wary of possible attacks by stray dogs.

 “On the way back — in the dead of the night — I have often been chased by stray dogs. along the way. That I ride a motorcycle makes it even more dangerous as I ride a motorcycle. It is hard to keep control while dogs are barking and chasing your bike,” Chauhan said.
 
 Many who start their day early or work late at night — cab drivers, milk suppliers, and waste pickers — live in constant fear of stray-dog attacks. 
 
 “A week ago, I was surrounded by a pack of over 10 stray dogs in Bavdhan, on the Pashan-NDA Road. I was returning home around 11pm after delivering medicines to Aundh,” said  , a pharmacist from   in Kothrud. “As I reached Ramnagar in Bavdhan, the dogs started chasing my scooter. A few even nipped at my leg,” Yogesh recounted. 
 
 “Then I got lucky. A six-seater vehicle came from  , and the dogs started chasing it instead,” he said.
 
 For some, food has come in handy in such when chased or cornered by dogs. “Dogs always chase us and circle our cart when we go around in the morning,” said Shankar Shinde, a waste picker from Chandannagar. “So we have biscuits and small bones in a separate bag for the dogs,” Shinde added.
 
 Residents have complaints to local corporators and other   officials to neuter such menacing street dogs or take them away, but to no avail.
