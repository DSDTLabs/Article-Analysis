GURUGRAM: A day after saffronite outfits threatened to disrupt Friday prayers on May 18, a Congress-backed group called for a boycott of people who are “trying to flare up communal tension” in the city.

 
 Sarva Khap Sarva Dharma Bhaichara and Samrashta Panchayat, in a news conference held on Tuesday, urged people to distance themselves from “those who poison the society by disturbing communal harmony”.
 
 “We are going to hold an all-religion mahapanchayat on May 27 wherein people from all faiths will assemble to ensure peace and harmony in Gurugram,” said  , a member of the group, adding that Gurugram has no history of communal tension and they will not allow anyone to flare up communal tension.
 
 Zaildar said Gurugram emerged as a business centre on global map and any kind of violence would dent the business-friendly image of the city. “Violence will badly affect the business and image of Gurugram,” said Zaildar, adding that people from across the country and even abroad settled in Gurugram and contributed to its development. People of all religions have been staying here peacefully for years. Choudhary  , the head of 360 villages, said the Muslim community had already said they would not offer prayers at any disputed places. 
 
 Thakkran said the groups had held discussion with the administration, who assured them that no one would be allowed to take law in their hand. “On Friday, if there is any problem, they will go to prayer sites and will request people with folded hands to maintain peace,” he said.
