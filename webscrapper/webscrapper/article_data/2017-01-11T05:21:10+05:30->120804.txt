WASHINGTON: A US-based company has developed a smartphone prototype that can be rolled up around the wrist. To receive a call, it can either be used as a speaker or removed and straightened into a traditional phone. At the end of the call, you may bend it back onto your wrist, the company said.

 FlexPhone, developed by US-based Royole Corporation, can also function as a fitness tracker and monitor your physical parameters, including heart rate, the number of steps taken, and the distance travelled.
 
 The phone is six millimetres thick and weighs 100 grams. The company said the phone's display as well as circuitry are flexi ble, making it sturdy in handling drops and bumps.
 
 The phone features 3G connectivity, and is SIMcard compatible.
 
 It was named the innovation awards honoree at the CES trade show in Las Vegas, US.
