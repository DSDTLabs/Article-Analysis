LUCKNOW: “Political parties promise all sorts of things before elections. As young opinion-makers, the youth must hold political parties responsible for what they promise,” said former   to government of India   at the first convocation of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Urdu, Arabi-Farsi  , on Monday.

 Lahiri, the chief guest on the occasion, asked students to believe in democracy and learn to raise questions. 
 
 As many as 245 students received degrees and 10 meritorious students were awarded gold medals at the convocation.
 
 Chancellor governor Ram Naik said, “There are 173 boys and 29 girls who received degrees but 50% of the medals were bagged by girls. One girl has even bagged two medals.” 
 
 As the previous batch did not have a convocation, Naik has asked the university to organise a supplementary convocation for last year’s graduating students. 
 
 The chancellor’s medal for being the highest scorer at undergraduate level and a gold medal for science went to Nida Khan. Mohammad Haroon was awarded the vice chancellor’s medal for securing second-highest marks in UG. Both students want to make a career in civil services.
