Tirupur: In the past 16 months, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) has temporarily sealed 183 dyeing, bleaching and printing units, including 96 unauthorised units, and two CETPs in Coimbatore district.

 These include the closure of the Eastern CETP and its 23 member units. Later, more than 60% of the units resumed the operations after they made the required alterations as directed by the board.
 
 TNPCB sources said that if the dyeing units were found violating pollution control norms, they should face the action to the extent of closure. But there is no duration for such punishment. Moreover, with the central and state governments’ assistance and support, permanently closing down those units is not easy.
 
 “Between April 2016 and July 2017, we sealed 15 authorised dyeing units for breaching zero liquid discharge (ZLD) norms. All of them obtained permission to start operations after we were satisfied with the rectifications they made,” said a senior TNPCB official.
 
 “Last year, a CETP in Angeripalayam was found polluting a water body. So it was sealed along with 49 member units. Since the CETP was short of many mandatory requirements, we did not allow it to function for more than 50 days,” he added.
 
 One of the main challenges for the TNPCB is to keep an eye on unauthorised micro dyeing and printing units because there are no proper records to monitor them. Many such units operate in residential areas. They often discharge effluents directly into drainage channels and water bodies, he said.
 
 With the help of the district controlling committee for unauthorised industries, we have closed 96 such units, including button dyeing units, garment washing units and printing units for discharging effluents without treating them. Of these, 48 have started operations, he said.
