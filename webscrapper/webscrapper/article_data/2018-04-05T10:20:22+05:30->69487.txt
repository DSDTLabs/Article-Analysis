MOHALI: The   government is exploring options to extend benefit of cheap power to the IT industry on the pattern of manufacturing industry. Providing cheap power to industrial units was a poll promise of the   in the Punjab assembly election. Nearly nine months after coming to power, the Capt Amarinder Singh-led government issued an order to bring down the tariff to Rs 5 power unit. 

 
  
 
 The power department will bear Rs 748 crore power subsidy for the industry for the financial year of 2017-18. However, the benefit was extended to only manufacturing units.
 
 Punjab principal secretary, industries and commerce, R K Verma, at The Times of India’s “CEOs’ roundtable on the startup ecosystem”, said they had originally included IT and ITES in the list of industries for providing cheap power. He, however, said the   (PSPCL) dragged its feet at the last moment as a lot of commercial actives were being carried out in the garb of IT firms.
 
 Verma said they would propose to extend the benefit to IT firms operating from designated area and those registered with   (STPI),  . “There are many firms which claim to be doing IT business but are doing different thing. It will be difficult to include the entire IT industry as it will be tough to verify units genuinely into IT business.”
 
 The representatives of the IT firms during the deliberations urged Verma to extend the benefit to the IT industry as it is largely dependent on power.
