MEERUT: Gone are days when you have to keep a tab on your   to save your foods from  . Now, just like a  , not only you will be able to set time of your gas stove, but can also keep the temperature under check — thanks to a ‘stove watcher’ developed by Class XI students Yash Bansal and Abiraam T.S of Dewan Public School here.
 
  Their   is among 18 models chosen from nearly 500 models displayed by 450 schools at a national-level CBSE Science Exhibition in Delhi. Their model is also only one from   to have made it to the list.
  
  Taking about their feat, Yash, 17, said, “One day, my mother told me to keep a tab on the milk boiling on the gas stove, but I forgot and the vessel burnt. The idea to make a device to keep a check on the gas stove came to me from this incident. It took one month to complete the model, which is affordable and compatible with all gas stoves.”
  
  The students have fitted a timer in the gas stove, which can be fixed to switch on the gas, thereafter it will be switched off automatically. Besides, a temperature sensor, which has been designed by them, can be fixed at the tip of the vessel to ensure that the food does not spill out or burnt in the process of cooking.
  
  Geetika Gupta, science teacher and mentor of the project, said, “In the regional round, out of 300 schools, 18 were selected for the national level. At the national level, 18 schools were selected and awarded by CBSE. While the students received certificates, the school has been awarded Rs 3,000 cash prize. This is the second time in the past 10 years when our school has been selected in the national level CBSE science exhibition.”
