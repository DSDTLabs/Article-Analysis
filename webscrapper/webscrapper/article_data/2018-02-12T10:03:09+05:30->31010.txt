SALIGAO: The Guirim gram sabha on Sunday saw a heated discussion over the non-functioning of streetlights for over a year.

 Other issues which dominated the gram sabha proceedings were the proliferation of migrants and the garbage menace. Ex-sarpanch   and another ex-panchayat member raised the issue of streetlights not functioning for the last one year in some areas. They pointed out that the highmast lamps and the lights along the national highway at   are not functioning and this is posing a danger to motorists. 
 
 Local residents also brought to the notice of the sarpanch that garbage has been strewn along the roadside by persons living in rented houses. They also alleged that the panchayat was collecting garbage tax from local residents, but garbage tax is not being collected from flats rented to outsiders.
 
 Villagers also brought to the notice of the gram sabha that the garbage collector does not collect glass bottles. Farmers at the gram sabha informed the sarpanch that youth drink in public along the roadside and throw beer bottles in the field. This causes a nuisance to farmers, they said.
 
 Locals also informed the gram sabha that, at times, the garbage contractor does not collect garbage everyday. Deputy sarpanch Sunny Nanodkar informed the gram sabha that the panchayat has started door-to-door garbage collection for the last three months. In case, the garbage contractor fails to collect garbage, then the villagers should inform their respective panchayat members or the sarpanch, he said. Regarding roadside garbage, sarpanch   said that the panchayat will inform the contractor to hire four additional labourers to clear waste along the roadside. 
 
 She said the panchayat received Rs 48 lakh for development, but works couldnâ€™t be tendered due to the GST issue. The gram sabha also congratulated   for winning a bronze medal in boxing at the   School Games.
