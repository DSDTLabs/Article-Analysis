Pop star   says she would like to collaborate with   Grande. The 32-year-old   has dismissed rumours that the pair have already worked on a track together, but she has not ruled out getting into the studio with the 23-year-old songstress when the time is right.

  
  
 When asked if Ariana was meant to feature on her track 'Bon Appetite', she said, "No, oh my god, we never even had a discussion about it, even though I love her and we'll do something together in the future when it's right. No one speaks for me, besides me. "
 
 "So if you didn't hear it from the horse's mouth, then it ain't true or it's not yet true."
