Dr  , daughter of well known actor   who was married to legendary actress Savithri, has come out to allege that the biopic on legendary actress titled ' ' in Tamil and ' ' in Telugu, portrays her father in a poor light. 

 Dulquer Salmaan played Gemini in the   starrer 'Nadigayar Thilagam', which has been getting great response from the audience. Talking about the issues she had with the portrayal of her father, Kamala Selvaraj is reported to have said that her father didn’t influence   to become an alcoholic. She has also accused that, what has been shown on screen is a one-sided version that glorifies Savitri, and bluntly ignores many other aspects of her life.
 
 She has also shared that, Savithri has once unleashed her dogs on her father to chase him out of the house when he went to see her during the time she was producing and directing 'Praptham' in 1971. 
 
 Kamala Selvaraj seems to be unhappy that the film has showed her father as flop hero while Savithri was successful and he felt egoistic towards her. She mentioned that Gemini   was a top actor, who was on par with MG   and Sivaji Ganesan. 
 
 It is clear that Gemini Ganesan's daughter isn’t so pleased about how her father was portrayed in the film.
