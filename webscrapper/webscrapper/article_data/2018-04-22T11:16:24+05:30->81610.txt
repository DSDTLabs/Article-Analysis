MARGAO: Environmentalists affiliated to the Cavelossim Villagers Forum (CVF) the Colva Civic and Consumer Forum (CCCF) on Saturday demanded that chief secretary   immediately remove Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority ( ) member secretary Parag Nagarcekar, and replace him with someone who is efficient and pro-environment.

 CVF president Iris Passanha informed the media that both the forums have petitioned Sharma as he is “effectively the de facto Goa chief minister in the absence of the elected chief minister Manohar Parrikar”.
