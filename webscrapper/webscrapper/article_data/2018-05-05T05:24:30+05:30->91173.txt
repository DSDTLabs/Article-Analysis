WASHINGTON: President   insisted on Friday that “we’re not changing any stories” about the 2016 hush payment to porn star  , even as he further muddied the explanation for the settlement by suggesting the new face of his legal team needs to “get his facts straight”.

 
 Trump said that Rudy Giuliani, who upended the previous   defence this week by saying the president knew about his personal lawyer Michael Cohen’s payment to Daniels, was “a great guy but he just started a day ago” and said the former mayor of New York was still “learning the subject matter”.
 
 The president added that “virtually everything” reported about the payments — which are the subject of swirling legal action and frenzied cable newsbreaks — was wrong. But he declined to elaborate.
 
 Giuliani’s surprise revelation of the president’s payment clashed with Trump’s past statements and created new legal headaches.Trump called the continuing news stories about Daniels “crap” and said the White House would offer an accounting of the payments.
