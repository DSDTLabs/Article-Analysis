MUMBAI: The   is aimed at firming up Gujarat's business lobby, alleged   on Thursday . “The PM's dream project is meant not for common citizens, but for the welfare of the business community,“ it said. “Japan will earn a profit, while land and funds will be provided by Gujarat and Maharashtra... This is nothing, but sheer plunder.“

 Pointing out that while the Maharashtra government has been hemming and hawing over a loan waiver to droughthit farmers, Saamna said Mantralay will now have to cough up Rs 30,000 crore for the   project.
 
 “(On the loan waiver) the state government said it would trigger a financial crisis in the state. And now the government is ready to part with Rs 30,000 crore for a project which is not going to be of any great value to Maharashtra... (There'll be) only four stops in Maharashtra... while Gujarat will have eight stations,“ said the Sena mouthpiece.
 
 Saamna contested the official claim that the bullet train will help generate more jobs in Maharashtra. “Japan will bring its own technology--from nails to the railway track, and technicians too... Japan is said to be opposed to roping in sons of the soil for the project,“ it said. The editorial coincides with Japan PM  's visit to India. Both Abe and Modi were to lay the foundation stone for the high-speed train project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.
 
 
 
 
 Opposing the bullet train, tribals and farmers under the   say the government should improve the suburban rail network first, and provide basic amenities like toilets and roofs at platforms. They also expressed fears of losing their land to the project.
