LUCKNOW: Five months after   and  , who is also the local MP, laid the foundation for the second phase of the ambitious  , it remains a non-starter. As per the sources in the Railways, the work under the second phase of the project will take few more months to start. Reason: Change in design.

 According to sources, Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), the executing agency, had prepared a plan and made presentation to the officers of the NER in March on the beautification and infrastructure work to be done at the place. The final plan was to be sent to the railway board for approval. But RVNL has been told to make changes in the design of the terminal which would be world class. Sources said that the plan would focus on improved aesthetics. 
 
 Cost esacalation is not a worry, said sources. NER CPRO Sanjay Yadav told TOI: "RVNL is working on the new design of the terminal." The terminal would get a second entry and additional platforms under the second phase of development.
 
 The foundation of the first phase was laid by the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee in May 2000 after which it was converted into a three-line crossing station from a halt under the first phase costing Rs 8.7 crore. Thereafter, Lucknow Development Authority allotted 42 acre land for the mega project in 2001. Thereafter the project remained in abeyance till the BJP government came to power in 2014.
 
 In 2016, the second phase of the project was revived and Rs 109 crore was allocated in the 2016-17 budget. The Railways got the 42 acre land registered for the project in September 2016 and the foundation was laid on December 2, 2016 and the construction work is yet to start.
