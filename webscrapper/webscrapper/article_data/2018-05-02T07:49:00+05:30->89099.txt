Ludhiana: Khanna police have arrested a woman, her lover, and an accomplice for allegedly killing woman’s husband and later throwing his body in a canal in Payal area of Ludhiana. The deceased — Surinder Singh of Jandali village in Payal — had gone missing on April 7, and his body was found a day later from Kotla branch canal near Amargarh of Sangrur district. Initially, Payal police had initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of CrPC into the matter, assuming Surinder might have committed suicide. 

 On Monday, Payal police registered a murder case after Surinder’s son Manpreet Singh claimed his father was killed by his mother and her lover. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Khanna, Navjot Singh Mahal, said the three accused — including Rani (40), her alleged lover Gurpreet Singh, and an accomplice Rajwinder Singh (both in their early 20s) — were arrested from a checkpost near Jandali village and have been booked for murder. 
 
 Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Payal, Rachpal Singh Dhindsa, said that Surinder (45) worked as a mason. He added that the accused confessed to the crime and told police that they made him drink liquor. After he became unconscious, they strangled him to death and threw his body into the canal.
 
 Police said Rani and her lover had hatched a conspiracy to kill Surinder, as they wanted to get married. In his police complaint, Manpreet said that on April 7, his father did not return home till late in the evening, after which he started searching for him. Later, he found him drinking liquor with Gurpreet and asked him to return home soon, but he did not come back.
 
 Manpreet added that the next day, his father’s body was found from the canal. Earlier, he did not suspect anyone, but later came to know that his mother was having an extra-marital affair with Gurpreet. He added that as his father objected to the illicit relationship of his mother with Gurpreet, they killed him.
