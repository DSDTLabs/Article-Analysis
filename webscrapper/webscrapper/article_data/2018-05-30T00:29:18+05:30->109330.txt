Coimbatore: The city corporation is renovating the storm water drain near Brookebond Road by covering it up completely with concrete, while the modern technology recommends perforated pavement blocks and perforated metal sheets as drainage covers. Activists said the project was a complete waste of fund as there isn’t any opening for the water to seep in. Corporation engineer, however, said they have set up holes on roadsides in such a way that the water could easily enter the drain.  “The drain connects to Valankulam lake. Renovating 500m stretch of it near Brookebond Road and setting up a footpath over it, will serve no purpose. The remaining part of the drain will continue to remain clogged, blocking water flow to the lake. The project was announced to desilt and widen the existing drain on Brookenond road. The holes provided by the engineers will be rendered useless once plastic or silt covers it,” said J Daniel, civic activist. Corporation engineer in-charge of the project said the holes were made of concrete walls and as such sand won’t enter and block the water flow. “We have followed all norms and there is no doubt that it will ensure smooth flow of water,” the engineer said without divulging more details, including the cost of the project. However, the newly-renovated drain didn’t look any different from the older ones set up across the city that had already failed. “The holes will easily get blocked. It is sad that the civic body has failed to adopt the modern technology that not only reduces cost and man work, but also could be set up easily. For example, at Lanka corner junction, architects have used perforated metal sheets so that running water from road could easily enter the drains,” said a city-based architect. Officials said the design was perfect and when the monsoon arrives the public would realise its functionality.
