NEW DELHI: Larsen & Toubro (L&T), India’s largest engineering multi-national firm, is likely to post an overall positive result for the March quarter, both in terms of order inflow and execution. Markets will try for management guidance on both fresh orders and execution.

 L&T will announce the fourth   of March quarter and full financial year of 2017-18, today.
 
 According to a Bloomberg poll, 11 analysts estimated a net income of Rs 29.9 billion for the quarter and 13 estimated consolidated revenue of Rs 410.7 billion.
 Last year in November, the company revised its order inflow growth forecast from the initial range of 12 to 14 percent for the financial year to somewhat flat, because of the weak inflow in the first two quarters. Analysts are hoping that this is likely to be beaten this time. 
 
 By December-end, L&T’s nine-month order inflow for the financial year is Rs 1.03 trillion and the total order book at Rs 2.7 trillion.
 
 A local brokerage estimated that the company is likely to beat its revised order inflow guidance because it saw a large number of order win in the final two quarters of FY18. Major order wins in the past few months included two packages of the Mumbai Trans Harbour link, for Rs 86.5 billion.
 
 On Monday, in the management interaction, the market hopes to see guidance about order inflow growth for the present financial year and if there are further signs of improved execution for domestic orders. Another local analyst expects the company to forecast a 12 to 15 per cent in revenue and a 5 per cent to 10 per cent growth in order inflow for FY19.
