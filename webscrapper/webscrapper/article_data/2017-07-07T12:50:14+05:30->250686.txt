MOHALI: Mohali legislator Balbir Singh Sidhu during the Vidhan Sabha session had raised the issue to scrap the mechanised cleaning and sweeping system in Mohali claiming as there have been major discrepancies in allotment of the tenders for the same.

 Sidhu said, "We have found some discrepancy in the issuing of the tenders for the mechanized sweeping system for Mohali. It has been allotted for unrealistic cost of Rs 92,000 per kilometer for sweeping of the roads which is being paid by municipal corporation (MC). We will scrap the contract and then review the tender document before re-allotting the tender for sweeping of the city roads. 
 
 I have prepared the details of the meeting of the question hours in Vidhan Sabha that will be submitted to cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu by Monday with recommendation of scrapping the project."
 
 Sidhu added, "We have learnt that such a machine costs around Rs 1.5 core and here MC is paying Rs 1.15 crore monthly to Lion Services for sweeping as cost of Rs 92,000 per kilometer to the company. If calculated annually, it amounts to Rs 13.8 crore and MC could have purchased its own machines by spending half of this money and save upon it. 
 
 The company has been facilitated out of the way and we can revise the tenders so that some public money can be saved."
 
 The mechanized sweeping system was launched with much fanfare by then Punjab deputy chief minister   in August 2015. Two road sweeping machines are being used for mechanical sweeping of the roads under the project.
 
 Sidhu said, "Then municipal commissioner Uma Shankar Gupta had cleared the tenders, which we find are inflated and no efforts were made to curtail down the price."
 
 The machines will clean 55 kilometers of roads at the night, said Sidhu. However, no such cleaning process has been undertaken.
