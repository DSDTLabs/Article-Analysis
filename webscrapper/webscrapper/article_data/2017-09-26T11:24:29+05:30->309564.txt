MUMBAI: Weak Asian markets pulled down the   on Monday with the index closing nearly a 1% down (296 points) at 31,627, very near to its one-month low level. Banks and financial services stocks led the slide as foreign funds continued their selling in the secondary market. In the last five sessions, the sensex has lost nearly 800 points, or 2.5% with investors now poorer by about Rs 4.7 lakh crore as BSE’s market capitalisation now stands at Rs 137.7 lakh crore.

 The Centre’s plan to launch a new economic stimulus package also made economists and analysts jittery as they fear that any fresh infusion of money into the market could force the government to overshoot its fiscal deficit targets. This is perceived to be negative for the economy since a higher fiscal deficit may force the government to borrow more which could stoke inflation, that too at a time when the crude oil prices are showing a northward trend. The day’s session was impacted by the exchange of heated words between the US president and his counterpart in North Korea as global investors remained cautious.
 
 To add to the rhetoric, the foreign minister of North Korea said that the US had already declared war and the Asian nation had the right to shoot down US bombers even it was not in its airspace.
 
 According to Jayant Manglik, president (retail distribution), Religare Securities, the market seems to be concerned about the impact of economic stimulus on fiscal deficit. “Besides, anxiety around the geo-political tussle is adding fuel to the recent turmoil. Put together, indications are pointing toward further decline and any bounce may attract selling pressure,” Manglik said.
 
 In Monday’s market, HDFC Bank, ITC, HDFC and Kotak Bank led the slide, while ICICI Bank and Reliance cushioned the fall partially. The impact of the day’s strong selling pressure was felt relatively more in midcap and smallcap stocks with BSE’s smallcap index closing 2.2% lower and the midcap index at 1.1%.
