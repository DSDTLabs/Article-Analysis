PANAJI: A   of   (Saloi) panchayat to discuss the issue of   has been stalled due to election code of conduct, even as a   has been floated for the project that is estimated to cost Rs 150 crore.

 The bridge proposes to link Chorao to Salvador do Mundo across River Mandovi, but a section of villagers had raised several queries related to its route, land requirement, quantum of compensation and environmental problems.
 
 “The huge embankments can adversely affect water balance in the area and the impact has to be studied properly,” a villager said.
 
 The villagers alleged that they were totally in the dark about the issue and a section of them had requested the panchayat to convene a gram sabha to discuss it.
 
 The issue had been discussed at the last gram sabha during late 2016. “The members wanted Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) to provide details of the bridge, route, land required and other aspects, in a presentation,” Salvador do Mundo sarpanch Sandeep Salgaonkar said.
 
 But, till date, authorities haven’t provided any details to the villagers and a tender was floated for construction of the bridge.
 
 “The people should be taken into confidence in this matter,” Salgaonkar said.
 
 A few issues have arisen after the floating of the tender. The villagers are tillers in comunidade land and some do not have documents of ownership. The route of the bridge near the village church links it to a narrow road that cannot accommodate heavy traffic through Penha da Franca.
 
 After the directorate of panchayats clarified that local bodies can hold gram sabhas, Salvador do Mundo panchayat is planning to hold one soon. “We will convene a meeting to discuss the issue,” Salgaonkar assured.
