PORVORIM: The   party has demanded a judicial inquiry into the lathicharge on the mining dependant agitators during Monday's protest. 

 Stating that the lathicharge was uncalled for, the opposition blamed the government for the problems that the common man had to face due to the agitation. 
 
 "Firstly, you allowed them to gather even though Section 144 was imposed, and later they were lathicharged. This is unacceptable," said Congress legislative party (CLP) leader Chandrakant 'Babu'   at a press conference on Tuesday.
 
 "What was the government doing for a month-and-a-half? Why was the decision to file the review petition not taken earlier? The government compelled the people to come on the streets," Kavlekar said.
 
  "Nobody seems to know who ordered the lathicharge. I called up the North Goa collector. She told me that she didn't give the order," he said.
 
 The CLP also formed a six-member committee headed by senior Congressman   that would look into the mining issue, and determine what could be done to restart mining. "The committee will explore all probable solutions, and also seek legal advice," said Kavlekar. Besides the opposition leader, Margao MLA Digambar Kamat, Curtorim MLA Aleixio Reginaldo Lourenco, Tivim MLA Nilkanth   and Nuvem MLA Wilfred D'Sa are also part of the committee.
