NEW DELHI: One of the creators of the notorious ‘thak thak’ gang has been arrested by the crime banch. Regarded as ‘Guruji’ among criminals, the 48-year-old accused was nabbed with Rs 8 lakh, which was stolen from a businessman. Under the ‘thak thak’ modus operandi, criminals steal from cars by getting the driver out on pretext of checking his vehicle. The accused was intercepted when he was returning to Delhi from Kolkata after executing a number of heists.

 Joint commissioner (crime), Alok Kumar, said that the suspect   belongs to Madurai but had made his base in Delhi’s Inderpuri. Kanhaiyan would send his gang members to other states to commit crime and then flew in there once a large amount of booty was collected.
  
  
 DCP Bhisham Singh said that many teams had been on he lookout for the suspect and a tip-off was received that he would be coming to  . “A team led by ACP Aditya Gautam and in-spector Sunil Jain nabbed the accused after he deboarded the Howrah-Rajdhani train. A pistol was also seized from him,” Singh said. He is being interro gated about the location of his gang members.
 
 The accused told cops that he had adopted the modus operandi with a few friends and also taught the tricks of the trade to others. “This led to the foundation of his gang. Soon, men as well as women joined the gang in large numbers. He had a role for each member of a module. In the event of an arrest, no gang member named him and Kanhaiyan would provide legal aid and would take care of their families,” DCP Singh said.
 
 The gang would distract car drivers either by knocking on the window, puncturing tyres, pouring oil under car’s hood at red lights or by staging minor accidents. One member would take away the bag kept in the car while the other members argued with the driver.
