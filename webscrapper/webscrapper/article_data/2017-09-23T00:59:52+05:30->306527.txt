NEW DELHI: Re-iterating its earlier observation that Delhi can’t “become another gas chamber” the high court on Friday issued a slew of directions to neighbouring states on banning  .

 A bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Sunil Gaur also ordered the Centre, Delhi government and the local authorities to inform it about the steps taken on solid waste management and disposal.
 
 With winter approaching   turned its attention to Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and   and their efforts to prevent stubble burning, while hearing petitions where it is monitoring steps to reduce air pollution in the city, since 2015. The court pointed out that practice of burning of crop residue usually begins from October and continues till January, during which the air quality of these states — especially of Delhi — deteriorates.
 
 “Considering the facts on record and the submission of the parties, and given that the kharif crop is to be harvested, there is strong likelihood that the burning of agricultural residue will be resorted to in this season as well. The effects of such practice can again be traumatic for most people and catastrophic for some,” the bench said, while issuing the directions on burning of stubble or agricultural waste to the states.
 
 It told the four states to “strictly implement in letter and spirit” the notifications issued by their respective governments under the Air Pollution Act banning such activity and ordered them to direct all the companies and public sector undertakings involved in power generation, board and rough paper manufacture, cement production and others, to collect the crop residue from farmers in exchange of money as part of their corporate social responsibility.
 
 It further sought monthly reports on the prosecutions launched to enforce ban on burning of agricultural waste from October 1. The court will next take stock of progress in implementation of its directions on October 16.
