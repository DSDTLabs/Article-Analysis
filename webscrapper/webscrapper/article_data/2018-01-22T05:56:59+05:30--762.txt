BENGALURU: Ten years after 110 villages and other municipal segments were added to the limits of   (BBMP), not many localities across Mahadevpura, Bommanahalli and   zones get piped Cauvery water.

 Residents who attended a zonal event of The  's Bengaluru Forward initiative on Saturday said they have to depend on water tankers and borewells, and their worries might just worsen with the onset of summer.
 
 "When do we get Cauvery water?" was their fervent plea. "While the residents have paid over Rs 75,000 per house for water connection, Cauvery water -- not to mention underground drainage -- has still been a mirage," said  , a resident of Bellanduru. Residents said it was high time the government devised time-bound delivery of water projects.
 
 "Bengaluru may be an IT city, but there is no underground drainage connection in newer areas yet," said Shreyas Ramesh, a resident from K Narayanapura.
 
 Later, during an interaction with members of RWAs (Resident Welfare Associations), BWSSB authorities said work is in progress. "The eastern part of the city has seen tremendous growth and it's a task to redesign our infrastructure. We are conducting location specific analysis to understand why pumping water to certain areas is difficult," said Mirza Anwar, assistant executive engineer, BWSSB.
 
 On waste management, residents asked why apartment dwellers were not treated on par with individual households. "We pay as much or more tax, but the waste from apartments is not picked up," said a resident.
 
 'Bengaluru Forward', a city-wide civic campaign organized by TOI, is bringing together citizens and key stakeholders to find solutions to major civic challenges.   is the knowledge partner for the campaign.
