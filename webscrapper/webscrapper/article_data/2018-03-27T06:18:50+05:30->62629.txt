AHMEDABAD: While many households have janampatrikas which supposedly shine light on the astrological future an individual, researchers from   in collaboration with counterparts in   have analyzed the entire genome of a   – putting together a ‘genome-patrika’ – which sheds light not only on the individual’s ancestors coming to the Indian subcontinent up to 15,000 years ago, but also what the future holds for him in terms of health risks.

  
 A research paper, ‘Sequencing and analysis of the whole genome of Indian Gujarati male’, which appeared this month in Genomics, a journal published from the US, states that this individual’s ancestors came to India about 15,000 years ago from central Africa via the Middle East and central Europe. The paper predicts a high risk of schizophrenia, hypertension, coronary heart disease and baldness for the person.
 
 The paper is authored by Dr  , former vice-chancellor of  , Vallabh Vidyanagar, and his colleagues from Ahmedabad-based B V Patel Pharmaceutical Education and Research Development (PERD) Centre, in collaboration with researchers from South Korea.
 
 Padh said, “The human genome consists of about 3 billion DNA base pairs. It’s like computer code, determining various aspects of their physiology,.”
 
 “As we know, India did not participate in the Human Genome Project in 2003. Our work has identified more than 600,000 novel genetic variations and this information has now been added to the world human DNA database,” he said.
 
 “These findings cannot be applied to the larger population without adequate data. However, once the base is wide enough, genetic data will help understand the Indian population’s physio-pathology and develop the necessary health policies,” said Padh.
