You might think that itâ€™s quite fancy to have a   for a graduation ceremony. But it did happen and it was a happening one, we must say. The students of a design school in Chennai organised this annual graduation fashion show at a plush hotel in the city. The ramp walk featured several top models from the city like Sahithya, Mehndi and Arti, and they walked in outfits designed by the students. Pearl sported a sari with a twist and matched it with an embellished blouse, whereas Swathi wore a one-shoulder dress with jhumka motifs. Each piece had its unique feature and a perfect blend of modern and Indian touch.
