KOLKATA: The footfall at the Kolkata International Book Fair crossed 3,00,000 on Sunday, cheering the officials of the Publishers and  . The initial jitter over holding the fair at a new venue finally passed as the numbers swelled with every passing hour. Though final numbers are yet to come in, the book fair bosses said at least 50% of last year’s sale figure of Rs 20 crore was likely crossed on Sunday.

 
 The fair is being held at the Central Park in  . Initially, only a little over seven acres of land was available there, making the organisers apprehensive of holding the mega event. Later, an additional seven acres was eked out after encroachments were removed by the state urban development department.
 
 Both the organisers and visitors pointed out that there was a distinct shift in the profile of the book fair visitors. “This time people who are genuinely interested in books, rather than those who treat the fair as a hangout zone, are visiting. You will hardly come across someone leaving the fair without buying a book,” said  , general secretary of the Guild.
 
 One saw many visitors who came to the fair from quite a distance, despite odds. While physically disabled Indroneel Kanjilal came from Asansol, Subhankar Ganguly came all the way from Bangalore. Dwaiyita Hazra Goswami, a new author, also came from Bangalore as she didn’t want to miss this “annual boi-pujo” for anything in the world.
 
 “On Friday and Saturday the footfall crossed 2.5 lakh and on Sunday it crossed 3 lakh. I’m sure we’ll cross our last year’s sale figures,” said  , president of the Guild.
