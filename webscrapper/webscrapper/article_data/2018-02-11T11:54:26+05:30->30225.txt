TIRUNELVELI: Depressed over his inability to save crops and repay the loans he had obtained more than two years ago, Krishnan, a farmer of   near   in   district, ended his life by consuming pesticide. 

 Police said Krishnan, who has three daughters, owned a three-acre land. After getting his daughters married off, he was living with his wife Kaliammal at Therkupatti. Due to poor rains in Manur area for over two years he suffered crop loss continuously and had borrowed Rs 1 lakh from a cooperative bank in addition to Rs 1.5 lakh from another bank and Rs 2 lakh from known sources.
 
 While he was struggling to repay the loans without revenue, the recent monsoon gave him a ray of hope. He cultivated paddy on two acres but the fast receding water level in the nearby tank became an issue of concern as he was worried that he would not be able to save them. It is learnt that he also did not have enough money to buy fertilisers and pesticide.
 
 As people known to him too could not help him with the money he needed to save the crops he was depressed over the last few days, but Kaliammal comforted him. At this juncture on Saturday morning he went to Tirunelveli to buy pesticide but consumed it on his way back home.
 
 Krishnan was rushed to the   and Hospital. But he breathed his last without responding to treatment.
 
  Tirunelveli district police said that a case would be registered under Section 174 (unnatural death) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Further inquiries are on to ascertain if he faced pressure from the moneylenders
