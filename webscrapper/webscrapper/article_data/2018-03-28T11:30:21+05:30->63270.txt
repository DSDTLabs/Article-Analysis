PANAJI: Health minister   said   availing of medical treatment at government hospitals in Goa will be charged 50% of the cost of treatment at a grade ‘A’ hospital.

 “Why should they be given free treatment? Do we get free medical treatment when we visit Germany, Australia, Russia or any other foreign locale? Even if a medicine costs a rupee, it wouldn’t be given for free,” said Rane, while addressing a press conference on Tuesday.
 
 “Foreigners have a lot of money,” said Rane, adding that his department will work out the rates to charge foreign patients. 
 
 Since January, all outstation patients availing of medical facilities, either at   (GMC) and hospital or at the district hospitals, are billed. 
 
 The charges fixed for outstation patients is 20% of the fees charged at a grade ‘C’ hospital.
 
 Annually, Goa receives about 5 million foreign visitors, of which some do avail of medical treatment at government hospitals. 
 
 A tourism stakeholder said tourists who visit Goa for long vacations, but are travelling on a limited budget, do avail of government health facilities. 
 
 “It is mostly backpackers who go to a local primary health centre or a bigger hospital in the locality,” Rane added.
 
 The health minister said, “We must think of Goa. It is not right to take everything free as Goa is a tourist state.”
