AHMEDABAD: A compassionate decision taken by the family of a brain dead man will give a new lease of life to at least seven persons. 

 Arun   (66), a former accountant, had chronic heart problems and underwent angioplasty in the recent past. On Saturday evening, he complained of breathlessness and chest pain. His family took him to a private hospital in Sabarmati. Doctors diagnosed cardiac arrest and did their best to revive the heart. Finally, his heart could be revived but his brain was dead because the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain had been obstructed . 
 
  Doctors then approached his relatives and counselled them on organ donation. “After the family members gave their consent, we consulted doctors from the   to go ahead with the   procedure,” said Dr  , who treated Mehta and counselled the relatives. “A team of neurologists also examined Mehta and sanctioned the donation procedure,” Patel said. “His eyes, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, and liver will be harvested at the institute for future donation and needy persons will benefit from his organs.”
 
 A team of the Kidney Institute will visit the private hospital to harvest the organs. Nisarg  , Mehta’s son-in-law, said that the family took the decision to donate the organs on the advice of the doctors. 
 
 “Though we have lost our family head, the organ donation will keep him alive in others,” Shukla said. “We request others to take the pledge of organ donation so that someone can live after their life.”
