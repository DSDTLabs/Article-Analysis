BICHOLIM: Abhijit Sindhure, 46, and his pet dog, who were grievously injured after the car they were travelling in collided with a bus and burst into flames, died on Friday night. 

 Earlier the same day, Sindhure, a resident of Vithalapur, Sakhali, had approached the slope near  , Sarvan, when he lost control of his car and collided into an oncoming KTC bus.
 
 The impact was such that the car was flung to the left side of the road and caught fire within a few seconds. Onlookers managed to pull Shindure out before the car burst into flames. They later noticed that his dog was also in the car and pulled it out.
