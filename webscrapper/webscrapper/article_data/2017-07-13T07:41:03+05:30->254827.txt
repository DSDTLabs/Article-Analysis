JAIPUR:   on Wednesday arrested a 23-year-old man for   of   after he was detained by   in Sujangarh. Navi Mumbai police produced the accused in a local court and applied for transit remand to take him to Mumbai.

 The accused, identified as Imran Chipa, was detained by Churu police after Navi Mumbai police shared an IP address from which the alleged hacking of data from a Jio server was executed, Rahul Bharat, superintendent of police, Churu, said. “Since we have to travel with the accused to Navi Mumbai and can’t produce him in court in the next 24 hours, we needed a transit remand from a local court of Rajasthan,” Bal Singh Rajput, superintendent of police, Navi Mumbai told TOI over phone. 
 
 Rajput said the cybercrime team in Mumbai was already verifying the data to ascertain if it was actually hacked from a Jio server. 
 
 He said there were clues to suggest data was hacked. “Nothing conclusive can be said at this moment. We will produce him in a Navi Mumbai court and apply for police remand to verify facts relating to the case,” he added. 
 
 The matter came to light in Mumbai on Monday evening when a website magica.pk provided details like first and last name, e-mail ID, mobile number, date of SIM card activation, and which circle it was activated in. After it came to the notice of Jio officials, an FIR was lodged at Navi Mumbai’s MIDC police station. 
 
 A Jio spokesperson said on Monday that the claims made by the accused through the website were unverified and unsubstantiated and assured customers that their personal data was maintained with the highest security.
