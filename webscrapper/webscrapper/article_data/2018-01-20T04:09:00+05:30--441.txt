Vadodara: It is not just in developing countries like India where girls are discouraged from pursuing higher education but even in developed countries like the United States (US), women and girls face such discrimination. 

 This is what Geeta Desai, president of New York-based Graduate Women International (GWI) said here on Friday.
 
 “There is a deep gender divide even in countries which are considered progressive. Girls in US are discouraged from going for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). There are many studies in US that show that girls are smart in STEM subjects up to class seven but they are encouraged to pursue arts or humanities,” she said. 
 
 “Similarly, women are disappropriately poorer compared to their male counterparts. In US, women make 82 cents on each dollar compared to man,” she said. 
 
 Desai was in the city to deliver a talk as part of ‘Samvaad’ – a celebrity lecture series organised by city-based Navrachana University, Vadodara (NUV). 
 
 She spoke on ‘Design your future: Personal and professional success in a global society’ at her public lecture in which she suggested ways in which students and young people looking for employment can think about choosing professions and the factors that may play a role in this critical decision-making. 
 
 She also shared with them what global employers these days are looking for in candidates applying for jobs. GWI’s India chapter is called University Women’s Association which has Swati Bedekar, a Barodian as national president while educationalist Tejal Amin is patron of Vadodara chapter. 
 
 Founded in 1919, GWI is a worldwide non-governmental organisation of women graduates, whose purpose is to promote lifelong education for women and girls, encourage and enable women and girls to apply their knowledge and skills in leadership and decision-making in all forms of public and private life.
