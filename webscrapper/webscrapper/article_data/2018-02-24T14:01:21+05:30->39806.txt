VIJAYAWADA: Bharoth Thaina, a 55-year-old daily wager from the ST community, of Lambada, from Deeplanagar in A Kondur mandal lived with his four children and wife happily despite poverty. Six years ago he developed knee pains and was not able to walk or work. When he visited a doctor in  , he was diagnosed a   disease, and doctors prescribed him medicines that would cost him Rs 6,000 per month. 

 Since then, things have changed for the family. The two young children who were studying at a local primary school dropped out, and were forced to work as labourers. The entire family now works through the month and is only able to meet half of the medical expenditure for Thaina. They travel to the city once a month with whatever money they have and buy medicines.
 
  There are many others like Thaina. At least one person in every two families in   is affected with kidney disease. In the past five years, at least six persons have succumbed to this mysterious disease in this habitat. This mysterious kidney disease is found in at least 19 Thandas (habitations) in A Kondur mandal. 
 
 Several have sold their cattle, sheep, or small portions of land to meet the medical expenses. There have been around 50 deaths in the 19 habitations here in the past five years. CPM leader Ch Baburao, said, “So far, the officials are aware of the kidney disease victims of   area. Now, the situation is equally serious here. These poor tribals are not able afford the treatment.” He asked the government to open a dialysis centre at A Konduru.
