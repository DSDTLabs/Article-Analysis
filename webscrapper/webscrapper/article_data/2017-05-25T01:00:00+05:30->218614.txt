The whoâ€™s who of the city was seen at the   concert organised by the Times Group on Sunday evening in Gomti Nagar. 
People started coming in well before the event was to start and soon the venue was packed to capacity with a lot of people also standing. The 'Jashn-E-Bahaara' singer too played to the crowd singing one hit after another. 
 Javed performed for almost three hours at the show and sang some of his popular numbers including 'Kun Faya Kun', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'Galat Baat Hai' and 'Kajra Re' while people hummed and sang with him. His rendition of 'Nagada Nagada' had the youngsters and the young at heart dance with delight right in front of the stage.
