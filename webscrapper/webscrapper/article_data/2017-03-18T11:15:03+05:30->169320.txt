IMPHAL:   to fight three-time chief minister   in the recent Manipur assembly polls was taken on the very day she ended her epic fast against the controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act on August 9 last year. Ibobi had totally rejected her plea to repeal AFSPA during her 16-year struggle.

 In October last, she set up   (PRJA). Besides her, Harvard University alumnus and PRJA convenor Erendro Leichombam and  , the first Manipuri Muslim woman to contest assembly polls in the state, fought the election. However, PRJA failed miserably, Sharmila even more so. She secured a meagre 90 votes, while Ibobi Singh got a whopping 18,649 votes.
 
 Instead of mass meetings and a full-blooded campaign to seek votes, Shamila focused on door-to-door canvassing. Her muchpublicised plan to marry her Indian-born British citizen boyfriend Desmond Coutinho after the polls was another factor for most key anti-AFSPA activists to distance themselves from her campaign.
