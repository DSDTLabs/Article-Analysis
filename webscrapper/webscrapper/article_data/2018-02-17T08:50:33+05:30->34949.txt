PUNE: The Hadapsar police on Thursday detained a 17-year-old minor boy for   an eight-year-old   here. The girl is a student of Standard II while the boy is doing a diploma course. The two are neigbours.

 An official from the Hadapsar police station said, “The parents of both the survivor and the boy had gone to the market. On finding the girl alone, the boy raped her and threatened her with dire consequences if she disclosed the incident to her parents.”
 
 The official said that the panicked girl was crying when her parents reached home. She gave details of the gruesome acts committed by the boy after her mother took her into confidence. The mother decided to lodge an FIR under the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
 
 Hadapsar police’s sub inspector Kalyani Shinde said on Friday, “The mother had stated in her complaint that the boy was 19 years old, but after he was taken into custody for questioning, it was revealed that he was a minor.”
 
 “We produced the boy before the juvenile court which in turn sent him to a correction home. A chargesheet against him will be filed at the earliest,” she added.
