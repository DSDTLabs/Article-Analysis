AHMEDABAD:   on Monday granted permission to a 15-year old   to abort 16-week foetus and directed the   in Rajkot to examine her again and terminate her pregnancy.

 In this case, the girl approached the HC when her pregnancy was in 15th week and requested for permission for abortion. The   (MTP) Act prohibits abortion after the pregnancy advances beyond 20 weeks. The girl belongs to Upleta taluka in Rajkot and after the incident of rape, an FIR for abduction and rape was lodged with Bhayavadar police station.
 
 The high court last week ordered medical examination of the victim. A panel of four doctors – Dr Manisha Parmar, assistant professor in Gynec Department, Dr Kavita Dudhrejiya, in-charge HoD Gynec Department, Dr Amit Shah, assistant professor Medicine Department and Dr Mukesh Patel, associate professor Psychiatry Department at Pandit Dindayal Upadhyay General Hospital in Rajkot – examined her and said that they would undertake the necessary and required procedure for termination of the pregnancy of the victim at the earliest.
 
 
 Following the positive report from the doctors, Justice AS Suphia asked the panel of doctors to go ahead with the procedure, and directed the medical superintendent of the hospital to hand over the tissues drawn from the foetus for the   to the investigating officer so that the sample can be sent to a Forensic Science Laboratory.
