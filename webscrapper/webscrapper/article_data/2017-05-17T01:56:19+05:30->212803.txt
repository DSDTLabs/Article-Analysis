NEW DELHI: A day after a fashion   was   at the parking lot of her apartment in  , the police have recovered a CCTV footage that shows the accused driver in a white shirt fleeing the spot. A sketch has been prepared to identify Anil. 

 The police are also scanning the mobile phone of the woman to find out if the accused had been stalking her. 
 
 It has been found that Anil was involved in petty crimes at his locality in Dakshinpuri. Sources said Anil might have been planning to attack Kaveri Lal since he had been fired a year ago. The possibility of a robbery attempt is also being probed. 
 
 A police team has been sent to Uttar Pradesh to track down Anil. 
 
 The victim’s mother,  , said she had fired Anil from the job as he used to pick up fights with people. 
 
 “We never used to like the way he spoke to my daughter or me when he came to our apartment even to take the key. I had suspected his intentions and decided to fire him after a fortnight,” Rekha told the police. He used to interrupt if Kaveri was talking to somebody, Rekha said. 
 
 On the day of the attack, Anil had returned from Uttarakhand with his family members after completing the last rites of his grandmother. “No one was aware that he would go to the woman’s house,” said a police officer.
