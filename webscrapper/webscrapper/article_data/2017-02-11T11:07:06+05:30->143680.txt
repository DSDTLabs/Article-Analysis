JAIPUR: The state   has issued orders to transfer three dams to the   ( ) falling in its periphery.

 Along with Nevta dam, the department will willingly give possession of Kukas and Kanota dams. As per the proposal, the JDA would develop areas for bird watching, boating and other recreation activities.
 
 After former JDA commissioner Shikhar Agarwal was transferred to the water resources department, the proposal was forwarded to transfer the dams. “In a meeting both the departments gave consent to the proposal. Following this, the proposal was forwarded to the state government for approval,” a senior JDA official said.
 
 Official further informed, near these dams there is existence of rich flora and fauna and it could be developed as good tourist destination for citizens. “Both Kukas and Kanota are 16 km away from the city, while, nevta is 24 KM far. All will be added location near the city as residents can visits natural spots,” added an official. 
 
 The decision will also give boost to construction of ambitious   project which is pending since long as small portion of Nevta dam falling in the alignment and water resources department was adamant not to give possession. 
 
 According to officials, nearly 1,100 metres of irrigation land in Nevta dam overlaps the Ring Road. The main dam is nearly 1.5km away from the ‘capacity area’. The JDA was planning to take possession of the land in the catchment area like Mej dam where the JDA has constructed the road. The proposal was earlier sent to the irrigation department. However, despite several reminders, the water resources department remained adamant not to surrender the land. After the joining of Agarwal, the matter was expedited and dam was transferred. 
 
 On the transfer of 1,100 metres of land, a JDA official said the agency had proposed to construct an elevated road and it would not affect the capacity of the dam. But, the idea did not receive support as it would increase the cost.
