PUNE: Nights in the city in the past week have been warmer with the minimum temperature soaring to an unusual 18 degrees celsius. 

  
 On the night intervening Saturday and Sunday, the minimum in Shivajinagar shot up to 18.4 degrees C, which is the highest minimum overnight temperature of the season so far (March to May) and the warmest March 4 night in the last five years since 2014, a look at TOI archives revealed.
 
 Similarly, the maximum temperature on Sunday was also the highest March 4 day temperature since 2014, the   data from the archives revealed.
 
 Since the last two nights, the city's night temperature has been four degrees higher than normal. Lohegaon recorded a high 20 degrees C as its minimum on March 4, the warmest March 4 night here since a year or more, as data from the TOI archives has been available for this station only since 2017.
 
 An   ( ) official told TOI that nighttime clouding is causing a spike in minimum temperature over the last few days. 
 
 The minimum temperature recorded in the morning of March 4 was around 4.6 degrees higher than normal, while till Monday morning, it fell slightly, to 18 degrees C—but still over four degrees above the normal.
 
 Summer begins in March and the rise in the minimum temperature will continue. A met official said that cloudy skies during the last two nights prevented the out-going long-wave radiation from the earth’s surface from escaping to the atmosphere. This kept the city areas warmer than the normal.
 
 “The cloudy skies have been a result of a trough in the lower level westerlies running from south Chhattisgarh to north interior   across Vidarbha on Sunday as well as the cyclonic circulation over Madhya Maharashtra on Monday,” he said.
