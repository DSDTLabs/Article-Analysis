HYDERABAD: Thefts like pick pocketing, chain snatching and luggage lifting remain on the top of the crimes list of the   (GRP). Records show that 891 cases within the   district, in 2016 up to November alone and property worth Rs 1.64 crore was lost in the thefts. In 2014 about 740 and about 938 thefts in 2015 were recorded. 

 While theft of luggage topped the list of articles targeted by thieves, both within moving trains and at other locations within the railway premises, chain/ jewellery snatching was the second favourite. Most of these crimes were committed by a network of ‘luggage lifters’ who work in co-ordination over stations.
 
 “It’s usually a planned effort with a member zeroing in on the luggage, photographing it and sending it on WhatsApp to another member. The second member of the gang gets in at another station with a similar looking luggage bag which is exchanged with the original bag,” said  ,  .
 
 This way, by the time the unsuspecting passenger comes to know of the theft, all gang members would have de-boarded the train. Trains from the city heading towards Delhi and running between Vijayawada-Nanded route are especially notorious for thefts.
 
 The government railway police deploys their men in uniform as well as in disguise, but the number of men deployed in each train is too small to man the entire length of trains. There are about 650 security personnel for escorting nearly 430 trains. The ticketing counters, trains and many parts of platforms are devoid of any electronic surveillance which makes nabbing chain snatchers a difficult task.
