The event will be held on Saturday. While traditional garba songs will be played at the celebration, community members will also enjoy dancing to a couple of  .

 “Usually community members are scattered in different groups and therefore, we decided to organize an event for them on our own premises at the Parsi Sanatorium,” said Brigadier (Retd) Jahangir Anklesaria, the president of the Ahmedabad Parsi Panchayat. “It’s an occasion to bring community members together.”
 
 Earlier, the idea had been limited to kids. “However, if kids come in, their parents will also join,” said Mehr Medora, the founder of the Ushta-Te Foundation. “Besides, a number of senior citizens from our community also took interest in the event and that’s how we decided to make it a community event.”
 
 More than 200 people are expected at the celebration. Talking about the two Parsi garba songs, Kety Daruwala, a volunteer with Zarthushti Awareness Group of Ahmedabad (ZAGA), said, “While the songs are no different from traditional Gujarati garba songs, they are written in Parsi Gujarati. These songs revolve around little titbits of the Parsi culture and how the community lives, depicting nuances in a humourous way.” Usually these songs are played at Parsi weddings,” she said. “We’ve asked all senior citizen members to wear traditional Parsi sarees for a traditional touch,” she said.
 
 Since Parsis landed in Gujarat to enter India, most of them are closely connected to the culture here and embrace most festivals with joy. “Garba, therefore, is another reason to enjoy and get together for the fun-loving community,” said Shirin Kanga, a community member.
