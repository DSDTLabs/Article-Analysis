PANAJI: Villagers residing in   plateau have alleged that armed with a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the forest department, GMR Goa Airport International Limited has started clearing forest areas beyond the scope of the approval.

 Speaking to the media on Saturday, Swapnesh Sherlekar, a villager, said the forest department’s NOC has referred to a total of 21,703 trees in about six villages, but the permission seems to be dubious as it doesn’t quote any survey numbers, but only villages. 
 
 “With this NOC, the airport building company may continue to fell trees for years,” he said.
 
 As per the NOC, the number of trees to be felled in Mopa is 2,755, Chandel-1,470, Uguem-2,496, Cansarvornem-2,686, Amberem-2,438 and Varconda-9,858.
 
 Alleging corruption, villagers from Ximeche Advan, Varconda and Cansarvornem said the felling of trees in the barricaded area was illegal. The trees are not marked nor numbered as per the law, one of them said.
 
 The villagers questioned the police near the barricaded area whether the trees were classified, alleging that it was supervised robbery. 
 
 While cases are pending before the   and   challenging the land acquisition and grant of environmental clearance, evidence is being destroyed, the villagers said.
 
    from   said, “We have been fighting in the courts since 2009 seeking justice. Felling of trees before the court delivers its verdict will be a permanent denial of justice to the Pernem farmers.”
