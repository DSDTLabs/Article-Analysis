Erode: A team of archeologists has reportedly unearthed ancient objects that date back to anywhere between 4th century BC and 3rd century AD at Kodumanal village here. 

 A four-member expert team, along with five archaeological students, had been carrying out excavation process at the village since January 8. 
 
 In 1981, another team had unearthed some ancient valuables at Kodumanal village, the team led by P S Sriraman, superintending archaeologist with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), excavation branch-IV, Bengaluru, said.
 
 “This time, we have unearthed copper pin, gold objects, iron spear heads and shell beads,” he said. According to him, Kodumanal village was a craft production centre anywhere between the 4th century BC and the 3rd century AD. 
 
 “We have also for the first time come across a few objects featuring the first four alphabets of Brahmi script,” Sriraman added.
 
 Among the discovery is a terracotta seal with Sanskrit word lavasa inscribed on it. “A trader, who might have come from North India, could have been left the seal here,” Sriraman said.
 
 The team has, however, temporarily stopped the excavation process due to rain in the area. “We will resume it in June,” Sriraman said.
