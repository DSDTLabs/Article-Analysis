Ahmedabad: Three days after the first FIR filed against Brijesh Bhatt with Ellisbridge police by a youth, the victim’s brother has filed another FIR against Bhatt with Khadia police for a similar offense.

 According to the complaint by Jaimin Vyas, 24, a resident of Raipur, Ahmedabad, he had a love marriage with Himani Dave, a resident of Nehrunagar, on March 26. Dave’s maternal uncle Brijesh Bhatt, a resident of Raipur, was against the marriage. 
 
 He had attacked Jaimin’s elder brother Dhrumil, a resident of Vatva, near Ellisbridge recently. According to Jaimin’s complaint, Bhatt allegedly confronted him near Ghunani Pol when he and his wife had gone to get a bike at 11.30pm on April 8. Bhatt allegedly asked them to discontinue the relationship and attacked Jaimin. He also inflicted a knife wound and threatened to kill him.
 
 Investigators said that Bhatt’s statement is yet to be recorded in the incident.
