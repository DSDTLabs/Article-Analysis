PANAJI: With the   (GSIDC) beginning to remove the metal barricades near the Captain of Ports (CoP) jetty, the Corporation of the City of   ( ) is also expected to swing into action to rid the footpath of encroachments.

 The GSIDC on Friday ordered workers to begin removing the tin sheets that had been erected along D B Marg, near the old secretariat, during the construction of the jetty. A day earlier, GSIDC managing director  , had inspected the site and found that the metal barricades had been used by Golden Globe Hotels to create a reception area for Casino Maharaja.
 
 “It will be clear now if any private party is involved in the encroachment of the footpath,” CCP commissioner   said. “If any encroachment is seen, a showcause notice will be issued and action will be taken.”
 
 The metal sheets that were erected around five years ago during the construction of the jetty, had obscured the encroachments that enclosed the footpath. 
 
 The CCP had asked a municipal engineer to survey the extent of the encroachment and had noted that the engineer had “seen gross violations” along the footpath and jetty.
 
 The barricades were left in place by the GSIDC on account of the construction of the terminal, which is due to come up as part of the jetty’s second phase.
 
 “The barricades were erected by the GSIDC for the construction of the jetty, well before anyone could start business there. The property is not ours, we constructed the first phase of the jetty and handed it over to the Captain of Ports,” Kothwale said.
