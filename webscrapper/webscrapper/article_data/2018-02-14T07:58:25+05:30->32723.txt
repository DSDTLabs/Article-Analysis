CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister   has directed health minister   to take up with the Union government the issue of shifting the proposed   in   to border areas, possibly Sangrur.

 The CM also ordered that future health projects be planned in the areas that lacked medical facilities. Amarinder said he would personally meet Union health minister J P Nadda to discuss the change of the medical college site too. Since the government had completed all necessary formalities, he would be writing to the Prime Minister to expedite the   AIIMS project, he added.
 
 The chief minister’s directions came on Tuesday during a review meeting on the status of these two projects.
 
 Mohali was selected for the medical college under a scheme floated in 2012 for which a pre-condition required that the city should have a 200-bedded hospital which the Centre could help upgrade. At that time, Mohali had one civil hospital with 200 beds, and no private hospital or medical college, and thus met the terms and conditions of the scheme. But in Tuesday’s meeting it came out that since then, more needy areas had emerged that needed better medical facilities.
 
 The chief minister also directed the health department to strongly pursue setting of 100% central project of PGIMER satellite centres at   and Sangrur. The health department officials said while the central government was keen to set the ball rolling, the PGIMER at Chandigarh had certain reservations. On this, the chief minister asked the health department to resolve the issues with the PGIMER at the earliest.
