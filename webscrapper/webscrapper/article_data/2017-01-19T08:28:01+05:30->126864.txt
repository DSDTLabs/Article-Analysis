HYDERABAD: After Bollywood superstar Aamir Khan and former Jammu & Kashmir chief minister  , it is now AIMIM leader and Hyderabad MP  , who has come out in support of the young `Dangal' star  , from Kashmir. Owaisi criticised those who trolled the 16-yearold on social media and pushed her to issue an apology.

 The troll followed the `Dangal' ac tress' meeting with J&K chi ef minister  .
 
 Speaking to the media earlier this week, Owaisi said that pressuring her to issue an apology was “uncalled for an unwarranted“. “She's a 16-year-old girl.She's not an adult... People who have pressurised her shouldn't do it,“ he said.
 
 But while voicing his sup port for Wasim, the MP also drew the attention of people to the plight of Kashmiri girls who lost their eyesight in pellet shots by security forces.
 
 “I would like to say to people (coming out in support of this 16-year-old girl), please also remember that in Kashmir you have innumerable number of small children who have lost their eyesight. I mean that concern should also be shown at the same level,“ the MP said Turns out, Owaisi himself got trolled for speaking about the issue. In response to his tweet, a number of people questioned why school girls should get involved in throwing stones at security forces.“Stop them from throwing stones and instead ask them to go to school,“ a person asked Owaisi. Another person who responded to the MP's comment said, “This is exactly why people like Owaisi are called anti-India.“
 
 Owaisi chose not to respond to any of the responses.
