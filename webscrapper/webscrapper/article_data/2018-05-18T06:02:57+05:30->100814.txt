The Central Bureau of Investigation has filed a fresh case against its assistant programmer, Ajay Garg, who was arrested last year for selling an illicit software to subvert Tatkal railway tickets reservations and acquiring disproportionate assets worth Rs 96.09 lakh.

 Garg was posted as assistant programmer in CBI between 2011 and 2017 during which time his total assets grew to Rs 1.46 crore.
 
 He had earlier worked with Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd (IRCTC) for four years between 2007-11 where he learnt the vulnerabilities of the railway ticketing system.
 
 During the probe it emerged that the legitimate income earned by him during the period was Rs 79.29 lakh whereas expenses were in the range of Rs 29.59 lakh.
 
 The agency has alleged that going by the known sources of his income, assets to the tune of Rs 96.90 lakh could not be explained and were 122% over and above his legitimate income.
