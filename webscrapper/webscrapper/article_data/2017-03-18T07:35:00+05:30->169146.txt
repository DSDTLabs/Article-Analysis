LUDHIANA: A day after   (LIP) MLA Simarjit Singh Bains’ son allegedly misbehaved with ACP (traffic) Manpreet Singh after being challaned for not wearing a seatbelt, Bains took away his car and he was seen going to college on public transport.

 Ajaypreet Singh Bains, a BCom-II student of SCD Government College, along with his cousin  , a student of BCom-I of  , was challaned at Model Town on Thursday. Later, a video went viral in which Ajaypreet was seen arguing with the ACP (traffic).
 
 However, not supporting his son, MLA Bains asked the traffic police to challan him if he had violated any rule. Speaking to TOI, Bains said as a punishment his son would not get car for a week and he would go to college by public transport.
 
 On Friday, TOI reached Ajaypreet’s college, from where both Ajaypreet and Jagjot left for home together at 1pm. Ajaypreet’s friend dropped them to Aarti Chowk so that they could board a city bus. He waited for the bus for 20 minutes, but when it did not come, they took an auto and reached Bharat Nagar Chowk. There too they had to wait for 20 minutes to get the bus, which when came was overcrowded, so they had to travel standing. The bus dropped them at Pratap Chowk, from where they again took an auto to reach home at Kot Mangal Singh.
 
 Talking to TOI, Ajaypreet said, “College ends at 1pm and I reach home within half an hour. However, on Friday I reached after 2.30pm.”
 
 About Thursday’s incident, he said, “I agree we should follow rules. But these should be equal for all. On Thursday, the traffic police did not challan a constable who was riding a bike without a helmet. I have also videographed it.”
 
 MLA Bains said, “I would repeat that rules are equal for all, including my son.”
