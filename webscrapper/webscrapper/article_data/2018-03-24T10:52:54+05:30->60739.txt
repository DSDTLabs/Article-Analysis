PANAJI: The state Congress finds itself in a dilemma as it tries to decide whether to go with a young face for the   president’s post or a veteran who can inspire the cadre’s morale.   (AICC) leader and Goa desk in-charge,  , has already begun discussions with party leaders besides senior MLAs to gauge the mood within the party.

 “We don’t have a shortage of young leaders and experienced too. But, we need someone who can take the party forward and strengthen it,” opposition leader,  , said. The names of Margao MLA Digambar Kamat, AICC secretary Girish Chodankar and advocate Yatish Naik are doing the rounds.
 
 A source said the party leadership may have to consider the person capable of weaning over one of the allies of the Parrikar setup in the event of getting an opportunity to form an alternative government. The mood in the party may be for a younger face, and all the more, as it has been suggested by the Congress national president Rahul Gandhi. But other factors may also be considered.
 
 Both Naik and Chodankar have claimed that they are not keen on the post, but would accept the responsibility if entrusted with the leadership post. Chodankar said the party’s entire voter base in the state was keenly watching the process with the hope that the party high command would select a president who can strengthen the party at the block level while simultaneously taking on the state BJP government.
 
 “The party must see the overall expectation of workers and sympathizers. They have the expectation that we must take a strong stand against the government. The Congress must be the voice of the last person,” a senior party leader said explaining how crucial the election of the president was for the party.
