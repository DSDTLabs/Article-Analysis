The   Office (NSSO) revealed that the female   (LFPR) is significantly lower than the male across all age groups. The puzzling aspect was that India's   declined while there was an increase in   rates.

 
 Literacy, along with educational attainment, is an important indicator in the dynamics of employment and unemploydecades, India has witnessed a continuous decline in its   (FLFPR), which stood at only 27.4% in 2015-16, as per data from the Fifth Annual Employment-Unemployment Survey (2015-16) published by the  .
 
 The report published in a research paper, 'Declining Female Labour Force Participation in India: Concerns, Causes and Policy Options', published by   (CII), also stated that during the peak working age, which is between 25-60 years, more than 96% males, in rural and urban areas, are in the labour force as compared to 37.48% (rural) females and 25-28% (urban) females.

 India's much-acclaimed performance in ease of doing business could not make the entrepreneurship space free from gender biases. The latest report 'Mastercard Index of Women Entrepreneurs' (MIWE) claims that Indian women are less likely to capitalise on opportunities as compared to men in the business sphere. When it comes to female entrepreneurs' ability to capitalise on opportunities, India was ranked 52nd among 57 countries accessed by the report. There is no change in India's position from last year. The country is significantly behind the US (4th) and China (29th). Indian women are not only less likely to show an inclination towards owning business due to cultural bias, but are also more prone to discontinue their businesses due to unprofitability or lack of finance, despite several women's schemes, says the report.
