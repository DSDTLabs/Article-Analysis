HYDERABAD: Hotel owners are upset over the move to make toilets at restaurants 'free for all'. Telangana State Hotels'   has said that there has been a fall in business at restaurants owing to the impact of GST. 

 At a time when occupancy ration is low in hotels, it argued that maintenance of toilets will be an additional burden.
 
 Association secretary B Jagdish   told  , “We want to support the drive of GHMC, but we requested the Mayor to consider our problems and exempt us. We can't object to any one coming here. However, customers at hotels are mostly from the white collar category and may not be able to rub shoulders with people coming from the streets. The maintenance of toilets will be a serious issue. Hygiene is important in hotels and restaurants. We have to spend money on cleaning them up.“
 
 Rao said, “Our business has seen a decline by 25-30% due to18% GST. We are also paying garbage licence fee and clearance fee which comes up to `5-6 lakh every year. The occupancy ratio is just 50-60% in most hotels and new hotels are facing more difficulties.“
 
 Petrol pump dealers who initially resisted the move came around. The Telangana Petroleum Dealers' Association president Rajeev Amaram told TOI, “IOC has agreed to pay 13 paise on petrol and 11 paise on diesel per litre which will go for maintenance of toilets at pumps. We are in talks with Sulabh International for a contract regarding maintenance.“
