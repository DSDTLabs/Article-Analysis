Chennai: The Vijay-starrer ‘Bairavaa’ ran into trouble on the day of its release on Thursday after a pirated copy of the action-drama surfaced online. The film, billed as a family entertainer, raised expectations after it was announced that it would be released in 450 screens across Tamil Nadu. Vijay’s previous release ‘Theri’ turned out to be a blockbuster hit. Superstar Rajinikanth’s ‘Kabali’ also faced trouble last year after pirated copies online affected the turnout at movie halls.

 Produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios,   was hampered by posts online that contained spoilers. A pirated copy of Bairavaa, which appeared to have been recorded at a movie hall, was leaked online on Wednesday night, on the eve of the release. When contacted, Tamil Film Producers Council president Kalaipuli S Thanu told TOI that he will take action to ensure the pirated copies are taken down.
 
 According to Abirami Ramanathan who heads the state theatre owners' federation, the Government of India has the power to stop piracy online. “In China, a separate department works on blocking objectionable content. We need to do something like that. Online piracy will kill our business in the long run.”
