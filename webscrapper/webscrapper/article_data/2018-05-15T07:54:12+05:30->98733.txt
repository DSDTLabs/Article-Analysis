Miscreants on Monday drilled a hole at a   outlet in   and escaped with Rs 9 lakh. Since the hole appeared very small, the police suspect the   may have been staged by the employees.

 The employees arrived at the shop at   at 12pm to find the cash box open and the cash missing. On checking the place, they found a small hole drilled in one of the walls.
 
  On information, the New Washermenpet police rushed to the spot. “Since the hole appeared to be very small for a person to enter, we are probing whether it could have been an inside job to divert our attention,” said an investigating officer.
