Thane: The six-year-old   who was almost on his death bed after being   in January has been given a new lease of life. The monkey, who was named Fighter, was being treated by Chembur-based veterinarian Dr. Deepa Katyal, along with volunteers from the Thane SPCA.

 “Our team immediately rushed to the spot and saw that the monkey was thrown a little away from the tower and was severely injured. A large part of its body and face had got burnt and he was bleeding profusely. We first rushed him to the Thane SPCA and administered him basic treatment; after which we shifted him to Dr. Katyal’s Clinic,” said Pawan Sharma, founder of RAWW.
 
 “When he was brought to me he was in a terrible condition and was literally on his death bed. The worst part was the maggot-infested wounds,” Dr. Katyal said. “Considering the amount of pain he went through and his will power to stay alive, we decided to name him Fighter,” she added.
 
 Fighter will be released back into the wild soon.
