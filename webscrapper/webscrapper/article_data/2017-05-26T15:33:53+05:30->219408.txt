PANAJI: The Goa Board of Secondary and Higher   has been flooded with an   of students seeking re-evaluation of the marks allotted to them in their   board examination. Though Goa Board chairman Jose Remedios Rebello, admitted that the board has received a record number of such applications this year, he did not reveal figures. Sources, however, said the number has almost touched 2,000. Last year, there were just 600-odd applications.

 The steep costs involved in applying for re-evaluationRs 700 per subject to be precisedoesn’t seem to have deterred students, some of whom have sought re-evaluation in all subjects.
 
 Once the re-evaluation process is completed, the board will upload the updated marks allotted to each student on its website, a practice that has been in place since last year to bring transparency into the system. Class XII results are crucial as they have a direct impact on students’ choice of professional courses and entry into colleges of their desire. An exponential rise in the number of Class XII students clearing the exam this year has further increased the competition for first year seats in various degree courses.
 
 The board had recently introduced the practice of emailing scanned copies of the corrected answer sheets to students at a cost of just Rs 50 per subject. Earlier, students could only check their corrected answer sheets and were not able to take a copy. This was expected to reduce the number of applications for re-evaluation, but it didn’t have the desired result.
