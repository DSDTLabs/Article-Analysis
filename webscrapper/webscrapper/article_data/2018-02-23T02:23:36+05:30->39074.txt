NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday held protests outside offices and residences of AAP  . Senior party functionaries accused the AAP-led government of pushing the capital into an administrative crisis.

 Delhi   general secretaries Rajesh Bhatia and Kuljeet Singh Chahal led the demonstrations at  , respectively. Chahal said Delhiites were dejected to see the AAP government violate constitutional provisions laid by Baba Saheb Ambedkar in the governance in Delhi. “The repeated contempt of constitutional provisions in governance shows how the city has been taken over by urban-naxalism to vandalise Delhi’s fabric of governance,” Chahal said.
 
 “It is strange that people of Patparganj and adjoining areas of east Delhi are suffering, even though the deputy chief minister represents them. In unauthorised colonies like Mandoli, Vinod Nagar, etc, people continue to face shortage of water. The area’s MLA looks after the education ministry, but no school or college has been planned and no mohalla clinic is functional here,” alleged Chahal.
 
 Bhatia, who led the protests at Patel Nagar, said: “People elected   and his party with the hope of change, but they are shocked to see the rampant corruption and nepotism. It is shocking to see colonies in west Delhi lack proper sewer system.”
 
 Among the areas where the protests were held included Chandni Chowk, Laxmi Nagar, Tilak Nagar, Moti Nagar, Malviya Nagar and Vasant Kunj.
