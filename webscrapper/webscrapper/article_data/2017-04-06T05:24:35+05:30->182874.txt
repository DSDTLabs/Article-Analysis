HYDERABAD: While   remained unfazed to the temple frenzy on   day, 1,500 km away from ground zero, the Sangh fringe led by   working president Pravin Togadia drew the battle lines in Hyderabad, saying only a Ram temple will be built and ruled out any   at Ayodhya. 

 "We need Ram Mandir and Ram Rajya as well as prosperity of Hindus. But we will not allow any memorial for Babar. Those who are seeking this are anti-nationals," Togadia said, while addressing a meeting after a   by VHP and its allies on Ramnavami on Wednesday. Right-wing rabble rousing in city assumes significance with   trying to make inroads into Telangana after a clean sweep of UP.
 
 Togadia said the fight is not for a Ram Mandir or a piece of land. "There are lakhs of temples in the country, including many in Ayodhya. But the Ram temple in Ayodhya is linked to sentiments of 80 crore Hindus in the country. No force in the universe can stop construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya," Togadia said.
