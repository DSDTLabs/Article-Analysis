TIRUNEVELI: Warning from the state government and the Madras High Court to   State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) who are on strike had bare minimal impact as many buses went off road for the second day in succession in   region. TNSTC tried to operate a few buses with temporary drivers and conductors.

 Only about 30 per cent buses were operated across the district on Saturday. The rest remained indoors at the 12 depots across the district. The transport corporation took efforts to mobilise temporary drivers for Rs 450 a day. Banners with the announcement were tied at a few places including the Tirunelveli junction bus stand. Private buses and vans had a good run as they were over crowded.
 
 Though some buses were operated with temporary drivers, there were not many who boarded them. “They may or may not have experience driving a bus. Even if they were drivers from education institutions they would not be able to handle government buses due to the poor maintenance,” said  , 61 of NGO B colony, who preferred standing bent in an overcrowded autorickshaw to the government bus.
 
 In   district, about 75 per cent buses went off road while only around 20 per cent buses operated in Kanyakumari district. Not many temporary drivers volunteered for the job in the district as many roads are narrow and traffic diversions are present at quite a few places on the Nagercoil to Thiruvananthapuram National Highway due to a couple of bridge works.
