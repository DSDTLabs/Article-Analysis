CHENNAI: Commuters taking the metro to board an international flight will soon be able to exchange currencies at the airport metro station.   (CMRL) has allotted space for setting up a counter, where passengers can buy  , starting from February.

 Metrorail officials said the counter will be located opposite the ticket counter at the metro station leading to the airport to make it easy for air passengers heading in or out of the station to   their money before they travel. 
 
 A representative from the agency that is setting up the counter said they will open next month. “We are right now putting up the structure for the counter,” he said. 
 
 There are already nearly six such foreign exchange counters at the international terminal close to the entry point and one at the security hold area.
