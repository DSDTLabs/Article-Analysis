Pimpri Chinchwad: The survey for the third and fourth tracks in the Pune-Lonavla suburban section would begin in the next four months, said Maval Lok Sabha MP Shrirang Barne.

 He said the final survey report would be sent to the railway ministry next February. The railway ministry this year allocated Rs12.5 crore.
 
 A meeting was convened last week to discuss railway issues, in which the survey for the proposed tracks came up for discussions. The main objective behind laying the extra tracks is to improve railway services for suburban, express and goods trains. The Central Railway’s general manager D K Sharma, Pune divisional railway manager B K Dadabhoy, some other senior railway officials and MPs participated in the meeting.
 
 The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC)’s ruling party leader Eknath Pawar had said in April that the corporation had decided to give its share of Rs275.23 crore for laying the two tracks. The length of the railway route in PCMC limits is 16.71km and covers five stations.
 
 In January 2016, the state government had directed the Pune Urban Transport Project to bear 50% of the project cost on the lines of Mumbai Urban Transport Project. It had said the Pune Municipal Corporation, PCMC, Pimpri Chinchwad New Township Development Authority and the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority should share the cost on pro rata basis (proportional to the length of the route in their respective jurisdictions).
