PUNE: The Nigdi police on Monday booked a man from   for allegedly duping two persons of their cars, collectively worth Rs 31 lakh, on the pretext of providing motor insurance in January.

 The victims — a 57-year-old resident of   and a 48-year-old businessman from Chinchwad — lodged two separate complaints against the suspect with the Nigdi police on Tuesday.
 
 The Kothrud resident stated in his complaint that the suspect took away his car for formalities to get him the insurance for the vehicle. “The incident occurred on January 11. The suspect introduced himself as an insurance agent and approached the victim to secure an insurance for his vehicle,” senior inspector   of the Nigdi police told TOI on Wednesday.
 
 In order to complete the insurance formalities, the suspect took away his car. “The suspect then called up the Kothrud resident and told him that he has an SUV to sell. The victim showed interest in buying the SUV and paid Rs 96,000 to the suspect as an advance,” he added.
 
 The suspect then promised the complainant that he will return to him with both the vehicles in two days. “However, when he did not return after two days, the complainant kept trying to reach him on his phone, but to no avail. Realizing that he has been cheated, he lodged a complaint on Tuesday,” Palsule said.
 
 In the case of the other complainant from Chinchwad, the officer said, the suspect made away with his car on January 19. “He adopted the same modus to cheat the Chinchwad businessman as well. He took away his SUV for various formalities to secure an insurance for his vehicle to never return with the car,” Palsule added.
 
 The officer said police have launched a hunt to track the suspect. “We are expecting more complaints against him from Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad,” he added.
