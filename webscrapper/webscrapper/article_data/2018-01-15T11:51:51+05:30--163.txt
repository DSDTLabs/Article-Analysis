KERI: Two days after TOI exclusively reported on   blocking the flow of   Mhadei tributary to Goa, Karnataka on Sunday stopped the work on Kalsa canal at Kankumbi.

 The TOI team which visited the   on Sunday found that heavy earth-moving machinery used at the site was removed and parked at the office of DRN Infra, which is involved in the project.
 
 DRN Infra as well as Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Ltd refused to officially confirm the stopping of work. 
 
 Workers told TOI they have been given two days off.
 
 The Goa government rushed a fact-finding team followed by water resources minister Vinod Palyekar himself visiting the project site after TOI on Friday exclusively front-paged the report, ‘Karnataka blocks   tributary, Surla waterfalls turn into trickle’. 
 
  During his visit, Palyekar condemned the gross violation of the Karnataka government’s submission before the Supreme Court assuring that it would not carry out any work at the site.
 
 Karnataka had during last summer stopped work on the canal and not resumed it after the monsoon. But, in December 2017, it resumed the work and, in early 2018, blocked the natural flow of the Kalsa nullah that flows towards Goa. 
 
 Ramdas Shetkar, a volunteer from the Vivekanand Environment Awareness Brigade, Keri, who visited the site on Sunday, told TOI that “ongoing work has disrupted the Kalsa nullah’s flow and course. Even the natural course of the Malprabha has been destroyed.”
 
 Reacting to the sudden stoppage of work on Sunday, residents of Hubbali-Dharwad visited the site and expressed their apprehensions. They said that the Karnataka government should undertake the work on a war footing to supply water to their region at the earliest.
