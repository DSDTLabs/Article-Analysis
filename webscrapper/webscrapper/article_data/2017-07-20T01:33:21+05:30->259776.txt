NEW DELHI: The SIT probing 1984   examined more than 1,000 witnesses in different states, the government told   on Wednesday.

  Hansraj Ahir said that the SIT formed by the home ministry had scrutinised records of 293 cases and after scrutiny, a total 60 cases were re-opened for further investigation.
 
 Out of these 60 cases, charge-sheet had been filed in four cases while 51 had been closed. Investigations are on in five cases. 
 
 The minister said there was no delay on the part of the SIT in completing the investigation. The records are very old and despite constant follow-up with different agencies, large part of them could not be traced. 
 
 “As the records are very old, they are also in very bad shape. Several records are in Urdu language, which had to be translated. Several complainants and witnesses who had to be examined could be located with great difficulty as they had shifted their homes, some were migrated to foreign countries,” he said.
 
 Ahir said the SIT has published public notices in 11 leading newspapers at four different occasions in Hindi, English and Punjabi language in Delhi, Chandigarh and Punjab.
 
 In these notices, SIT has requested individuals, group of persons, associations, institutions and organisations acquainted with the facts of the case to give evidence/depose about the same so as to facilitate investigation.
