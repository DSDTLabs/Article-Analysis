BENGALURU: A full house greeted   at the masterclass she was holding ahead of the Times LitFest.

 The half-day workshop on the topical subject, ‘Writing for Women’, saw a rather interesting demographic taking part. There were 70-year-olds and kids barely 10, all nursing dreams of becoming writers. As a senior editor at Feminist Press, Hook had a lot of knowledge to impart. A key message that she reiterated through the workshop, for which she even played a popular TED talk by  , was about ‘Thinking beyond a single story’ — of writing stories that defy stereotypes.
 
 “I would encourage you not to compromise,” was Hook’s advise on balancing the tricky act of writing what one wanted to what the publisher demanded. Calling feminism the buzzword of the season, especially in the US, Hook joked, “The problem is that the word is getting coopted to sell everything today. Publishers are selling books with ‘feminism’ on their titles; 20 years ago, this wouldn’t have been possible!”
 
 
 
 
 “I think we need more writing for women because a lot of the literature written by women for women gets lost. It gets lost because people in power or in the publishing industry are men and they think their perspectives are it. We need more women and those of other minorities like non-binary genders to write more because theirs are the stories that need to be written,” Hook told TOI later.
 
 The workshop ended with Hook, literary agent   and festival director   talking about the business of publishing.
