Navi Mumbai: One of the city’s attractions, Gavlidev  , has been turned into a dump yard by unruly   who litter the place with leftover food and plastics, destroying the ecology of the green zone.

 Located along the Parsik mountain range at Ghansoli, the waterfall is a stone’s throw away from Thane Belapur road and draws a huge crowd over the weekend. 
 
 Several tons of waste have been dumped here in the last two days and the authorities are oblivious. Despite warning boards put up to caution picnickers not to venture inside the dense forest and near the waterfall, many prefer to risk their lives by going close to the waterfall. 
 
 The fencing on a a decade-old well has also been damaged, paving way for many picnickers who take a plunge without the knowledge of its depth and danger.
 
 “We have repeatedly asked the forest wing to hand over the place for its better upkeep and for exploring its potential as a tourist attraction, but all efforts have gone in vein,” said Ghansoli ward officer and assistant civic chief Dattatray Nagare.
 
 Drunkards too make it a sore experience for families visiting the waterfall, said Kalwa resident Harish Gala.
 
 NMMC additional commissioner Ankush Chavan said since the area was under the forest department, they could not do much to ensure safety of the revellers. “We will speak to the forest officials before deploying our security personnel and waste management staff. We need their permission to even put up warning boards.”
