KANNUR: After the   meeting on Tuesday to ensure peace in Kannur, the  , Paraprath Nalinakshan, near Ponniam in Thalassery came under attack around 3 am on Wednesday.

 Nalinakshan was not at home when a bomb was hurled at his home, only the windowpanes were damaged in the attack. BJP alleged that the CPM had carried out the attack.
 
 BJP leader P K Krishnadas, who visited the house, said the CPM should come forward to disown the criminals who were behind the attack and the police should take stern action against the criminals.
 
 However, police said that the attack was, prima facie, not political. "Preliminary investigation showed that there was no political involvement in the attack. Search operations are on to nab the culprits," said  . Though the police are in the process of intensifying operations, there are concerns about nefarious elements with local political clouts continuing such criminal activities.
 
 On the other hand, CPM feels that it needs an image makeover now because if the fingers are pointed towards the party in connection with this incident, it might affect the image of the government. The CPM leadership had apparently sent a warning signal to the local leadership asking them to keep away from any sort of violence.
