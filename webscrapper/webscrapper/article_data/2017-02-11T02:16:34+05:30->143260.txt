NEW DELHI:   could be in sight for Delhi  , which is struggling to complete a section of the Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar corridor under Phase-III. The Delhi Development Authority on Friday changed the   status of a plot in Trilokpuri, which could pave the way for construction of a 286m viaduct that is crucial for Line 7.

 TOI had reported last week how two small patches of land — a 286-metre-long stretch in Trilokpuri and a 100m plot in Hasanpur — could derail Metro's expansion into east Delhi this year. Delhi Metro chief Mangu Singh had said that because of these yet-to-be-acquired pieces of land, only a part of the Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar corridor would be ready this year.
 
 While DMRC will still need the court’s approval to go ahead with its plan, DDA’s move to change the land-use status of the land measuring 3,164.3 sqm from recreational to residential has come as a huge boost. It may allow DMRC to go ahead with the construction of a block of 354 units for residents who need to be vacated from their present location where the viaduct is to come up.
 
 Construction of this bit could expedite work for connecting Trilokpuri with Mayur Vihar and Vinod Nagar depot on either side. This could help Metro commission the section earlier than expected.
 
 On February 6, TOI had reported how Trilokpuri is a huge bottleneck on the Lajpat Nagar-Shiv Vihar section. One hundred and eight houses in Block 15 are to be razed to make way for the viaduct of the corridor. While Delhi Metro may have started work on building the 354 units or houses to resettle the residents of Block 15 - under police protection - another spanner has been put in the works. A group of residents has gone to court alleging the alternative site is a green area, so houses cannot be built there.
