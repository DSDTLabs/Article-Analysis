Panaji: There is a need for more interaction and communication among the scientist community in order to let their creative juices flow, said Nobel laureates Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Professor Richard Roberts. They were speaking at a session on creativity in science at National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) Dona Paula, on Saturday.

 “Communication with other scientists and people helps come up with new ideas and discoveries. Scientists need to find an environment that is more stimulating in order to develop such thoughts and ideas,” said Nüsslein-Volhard.
 
 “There are many creative individuals who may come up with good ideas on their own. But only when it’s shared does it becomes useful and helpful. Thus, active talking brings better results. So, the idea of communicating in very important,” said Roberts.
 
 Both agreed that the networks are quite critical since there are open exchanges and meetings where unpublished work is discussed and suggestions to make it better are offered.
 
 During the session, Nüsslein-Volhard also touched upon gender discrimination that she faced in her career.
 
 “I have found it quite difficult,” she said. “Everyone recognizes you as someone who is not the same as others. Back then, I encountered quite a lot of discrimination, which would not be the case in today’s time.”
 
 The two Nobel laureates also shared their views on how the system of government funding for projects has the potential to suppress a scientist’s creativity with certain committees demanding specific things in their research.
