KOZHIKODE: The house of the woman, who had to undergo an abortion after she was manhandled by a gang of six people, including a   leader in January, came under attack at   late last night.

 The victim   and family had shifted from   to a rented house at Thamarassery recently.   said her house was pelted with stones at around 1am on Thursday night. Also, coconuts were hurled at the house and the tiles of the house got shattered, she said.
 
 
 “Though the broken tile pieces fell inside the house, no one was injured. We saw two people speeding away in a two-wheeler when we came out after the attack,” Jyotsna said. Thamarassery police have registered a case in connection with the incident.
 
 It was on January 28 that Jyotsna was assaulted when she tried to stop the manhandling of her husband by the six-member gang led by  , secretary of CPM Velangode branch. Four-month pregnant Jyotsna was allegedly kicked in the stomach and though she was rushed to a hospital following heavy bleeding, the foetus could not be saved.
 
 Jyotsna’s husband   said he suspected that the attack against their house could be part of the repeated threats being made against them by the local CPM leaders at Kodenchery.
 
 Jyotsna had earlier announced that she would stage a hunger strike in front of the collectorate on Thursday but the strike was called off following the imposition of prohibitory orders in the city limits on Wednesday banning processions, rallies, marches and public meetings.
 
 Jyotsna and husband had earlier alleged that the CPM local leadership had ostracised them and were not allowing them to live peacefully in their rented house at Thamarassery.
