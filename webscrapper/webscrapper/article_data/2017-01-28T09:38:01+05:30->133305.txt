MUMBAI: Two   for passing off  ,000 notes as the real thing recently. Most of the fake notes were used in beer bars. 

 The Rs 2,000 notes were introduced by the RBI on November 10 following demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.
 
 Acting on a tip-off, the Kashimira unit of the crime branch raided the Om Shree Ganesh Estate Agency, on Goddev Road, Bhayander (east). The police seized a scanner and a printer used to photocopy the notes.
 
 The accused were identified as   (37) and   (36). The two, who are partners, had reportedly boasted about their art of passing off fake notes as real. The police said the accused had confessed to having "spent" 40 photocopies of Rs 2,000 notes, mostly in beer bars.
 
 The police seized 14 A1 size blank papers used to print scanned Rs 2,000 notes. The police found 32 photocopies of Rs 2,000 notes on the two. The accused had begun by photocopying a few notes and, when they succeeded in spending these without arousing suspicion, they went on to print on a mass scale, said the police.
 
 The two were booked under sections 489 (a) and (b) for counterfeiting currency and 420 (cheating) of the IPC. They were remanded in police custody.
 
 In November, a 26-year-old man was arrested after he tried to use a photocopied Rs 2,000 note in a wine shop in Virar.
