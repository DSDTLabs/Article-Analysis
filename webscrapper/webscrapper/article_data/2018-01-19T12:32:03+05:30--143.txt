HAVERI: The   built by   near the bus terminal to facilitate people to cross the national highway has been reduced to a platform for boards displaying advertisements. 

 Pedestrians continue to cross the busy NH-4 risking their lives, the skywalk notwithstanding.
 
 Some agencies are using the skywalk to display their advertisements. Local vendors allege that traffic police have failed to create awareness among people about the importance of using the skywalk to cross the ever busy road. 
 
 “I have not seen a single person using the skywalk till today. Its purpose will not serve as long as it’s used only to display ads,” said  , a fruit seller. He noted that people entering the bus terminal from the city side avoid the skywalk while crossing the road. 
 
 “They do not climb the steps leading to the skywalk. Almost all travellers, including women, elderly people and children, coming in and out of the bus terminus avoid using the skywalk,” he claimed.
 
 Basvaraj Masur, a social worker, said: “Police had placed barricades in the middle of the road earlier to prompt people to use the skywalk. For whatever reason, the barricades were removed, and their absence has encouraged people to cross the NH directly,” he said and suggested that the police place the barricades again. “Only then people will use the skywalk and stay safe,” he added.
 
 Goudappa Gouda, circle police inspector attached to the town police station, said that the skywalk is useful for the public to cross the road, “but it is not happening”. 
 
 “We had deputed a policeman to appeal to people — on a public address system (speaker) — to use the skywalk. We will take   to ensure that,” he said.
