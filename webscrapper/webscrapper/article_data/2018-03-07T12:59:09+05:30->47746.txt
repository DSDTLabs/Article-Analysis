TIRUNELVELI:   state president   lost her cool when a reporter criticised her for being close to an hour late to the press meet here on Tuesday afternoon.

At this juncture   said that the incident over the president’s visit is not true. She said that lies were spread in the social media.
 
 She also asked journalists not to air or publish the argument over this issue. “I will not give press meets anymore if this explanation is published as I am giving the explanation as your sister,” she said. To this, another senior journalist strongly responded by saying it is her wish to give press meets and asked her to value time and be on time. As the argument was getting heated up BJP leaders including state vice-president   pacified journalists.
