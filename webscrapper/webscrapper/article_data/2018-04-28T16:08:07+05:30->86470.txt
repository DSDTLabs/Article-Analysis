While shooting for her new   show in Kolkata, actress   got a chance to meet India’s former cricket captain  . The actress was shooting with the cricketer for one of the episodes. They spoke about films, cricket and the evolving interconnected network of both worlds. 

 Commenting on her meeting with Dada, Aahana says, “I had an episode of my show that I shot in Kolkata. That's when I got to meet and interview Sourav Ganguly. We went to his house and asked him if we could do the interview inside his house instead of his office and he very sweetly allowed for the same. We got to see his home from the outside. Even though it was a match day he gave us time and spoke about theatre, cricket and films. He explained to me how the game has evolved over the years. It was one of the best interviews and he is one of the most humble people I have ever met. He has an unmatched sense of humour. He also gave me the daak naam Ohona. That is going to be one of my sweetest and fondest memories of Kolkata. He is a legend for a reason."
