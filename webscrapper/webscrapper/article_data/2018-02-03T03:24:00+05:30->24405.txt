Panaji: Congress MLAs on Friday decided to move a private members’ resolution in the coming assembly session proposing that a statue of Jack de Sequeira be erected in the state assembly complex. The unanimous decision, which was taken at the Congress legislature party (CLP) meeting, is likely to put the GFP-BJP government on the back foot. “All Congress MLAs will move a private members’ resolution proposing that a statue of Sequeira be installed in the assembly complex in remembrance of his efforts towards the Opinion Poll,” leader of opposition Chandrakant Kavlekar said. The GFP, an ally in the ruling Manohar Parrikar-led government, had earlier said that they would try to unite various parties to pass a resolution in the assembly for erecting a statue of Sequeira, who spearheaded the movement against Goa’s merger with Maharashtra. Calangute BJP MLA and deputy speaker Michael Lobo had also stated that he would move a private member’s resolution. However, the BJP has categorically stated that it is against the installation of Sequeira’s statue of in the assembly complex.
