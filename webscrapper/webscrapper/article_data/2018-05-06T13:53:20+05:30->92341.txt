The Apollo Hospitals organised a flash mob    

 The event saw 15 students of Sri Venkateswara College of Pharmacy performing at the hospital premises, much to the delight of the patients and hospital staff.  

 Stating that lack of hand hygiene is the most important cause of infection, Dr Ratna Rao, Head of Microbiology Department, Apollo Hospitals, said, “Cleaning hands is vital, as germs in our hands are invisible to the eye.”  

 “It is extremely critical in healthcare set up too. It is the only act which can ensure patients being safe from infections,” added Ratna.
