Yavatmal: Around 32 associate professors of Shri Vasantrao Naik Government Medical College, Yavatmal, were served notice by the dean of the institute on Tuesday to stop the illegal private practices. They professors have been warned of disciplinary action if they do not take the notice seriously. According to the dean Dr Ashok Rathod, 31 associate professors of various departments and one HoD and professor of orthopaedic surgery department have been shortlisted on the basis of the personal information and complaints from people about their illegal private practice. “The professors were served similar notices earlier too but it seems to have had no effect. This would be the last warning to them. If they fail to oblige, action under relevant sections will be taken, ” said Rathod. The professors allegedly give more importance to their private practices rather than attending the poor and needy patients in the OPDs and wards of GMC. “It is surprising to note that till now, none of the people’s representatives took cognisance of such illegal private practices by the Government salaried doctors of the GMC,” said a source. Meanwhile, a complaint has been raised from the orthopaedic department that the HoD, Dr M B Lingayat, who was transferred from Aurangabad in 2014 in place of outgoing HoD Dr Thorat, has not attended his duty since the last couple of years. His salary is regularly drawn till March last. On inquiry, it was learnt that Dr Lingayat is suffering from Tuberculosis and he has been on long leave on the said grounds. However, so far, he has not been asked to appear before the medical board to confirm his disease. It is rumoured that Dr Lingayat is attending his private practice in Aurangabad after claiming that he is a tuberculosis patient.
