KOCHI: State government does not intend to take on the judiciary over the apex court verdict quashing the ordinance to regularize the admission to   and   medical colleges, chief minister   said. Speaking to media on the sidelines of a programme in Kochi on Thursday, the chief minister said the government would think of follow-up actions.

 There was pressure from different quarters including the public for the government to interfere in the matter, Pinarayi Vijayan said. The bill was introduced after considering the fate of the students who got admissions in these two medical colleges. Those including the opposition pledged their support for the government to bring in legislation to regularize the admissions.
 
 
 Health minister K K   said the government introduced the bill for protecting the interests of the students. Stating that both these colleges made admissions by cheating the government, she said the government has no soft corners for them.
 
 Shylaja said the government took advise from legal experts including attorney general before presenting the bill. But the government had apprehensions whether the bill would stand if it is challenged in the court, she admitted. “After considering the opinion of legal experts and the opposition we decided to bring in the legislation,” the minister said.
 
 Shylaja said the they will act as per the court order. “Earlier, we had advised the students and parents to explore other options, but they didn’t heed it citing huge banks loans they have already taken for getting admissions,” she said.
