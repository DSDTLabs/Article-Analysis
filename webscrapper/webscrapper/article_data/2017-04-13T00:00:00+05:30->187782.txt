Malayalis’ very own festival of prosperity is just round the corner, and we took a walk down the best place to get the   vibe - the street markets of the State. 

 The usual array of Vishu items were lined up on the streets of Kochi with street vendors awaiting the much anticipated Vishu customers.
 We spotted real konnapoovu and also imported Chinese flowers – look alikes of the konna, displayed at the shops. The vibrant colours of golden melon and pumpkin gave a rich and auspicious look to the entire atmosphere, adding to the festive mood.
 
  Roy KP, a wholesale dealer from Kochi, says that the number of customers has been going up with each passing day. Beautiful idols of Lord Krishna, crafted to perfection, are arranged symmetrically in his shop, and they were surely the cynosure of all eyes. Figurines ranging in size from six inches to four feet catch our eye. Roy adds, “We have Krishna idols made out of polymarble, which gives it a golden hue. It is the highlight of the year and is more in demand. The others are made of plaster of Paris, white metal and black metal.” The Vishu exclusive products range from `100 to `1000, according to him. The ones made of clay are the least expensive among the lot.
 
 However, Trivandrum-based vendor Ratheesh Kudappanakunnu and Roy hint at a dip in the sales this year, when compared to the earlier years. “It might be because of the scorching sun and the humid weather; people don’t want to be outdoors during the day. Demonitisation is still a matter of concern, as many of our customers have been saying that they have not been able to withdraw the required amount from the banks.”
 However, they say that they are pinning their hopes on the last two days which they hope would bring more takers to the shops.
