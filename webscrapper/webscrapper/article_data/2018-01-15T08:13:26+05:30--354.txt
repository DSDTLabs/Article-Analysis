LUCKNOW: UP   chairperson, Waseem Rizvi, on Sunday claimed that he got a threat call from a person associated with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim for his "anti-madrassa" statements.   said he received a call from a Nepal number on Saturday night and the caller claimed to be an aide of Dawood. 

 He filed a complaint at the   police station in Lucknow following which an FIR was registered under Section 507 (Criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) of IPC.
 
 The Shia board chief had recently sent a letter to PM Modi and UP chief minister   demanding that madrassas be shut down as they radicalise Muslims and produce terrorists. Muslim clerics had condemned his statements and the Maharashtra unit of   had sent a legal notice to Rizvi, claiming Rs 20 crore in damages and seeking written apology.
 
  "I got a call around 10:30pm on Saturday from a Nepal number and the caller said he was carrying some ' bhai's' message for me. When I asked whom was he referring to, he said Dawood Ibrahim. He said I was getting Muslims killed and told me to apologise to clerics. He threatened that my life and my family would be in danger if I did not take back my words in Babri Masjid case and my statements on madrassas," he said. 
 
  Rizvi said he had recorded the conversation and would produce it when needed. "It is now clear that these radical clerics have connections with terror organisations and even Dawood Ibrahim. My life is under threat," he said.
