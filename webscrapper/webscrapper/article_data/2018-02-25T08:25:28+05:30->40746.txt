HYDERABAD: Wouldn't you love to have a helmet that could blow cool air on your head during summers to beat the heat and warm air in winters to kill the chill? 

 Well, this may soon become a reality if a Hyderabad start-up floated by three 22-year-old mechanical engineers -  , Sreekanth Kommula and   - has its way.
 
 The trio, which passed out in 2016 from VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology, Bachupally, has already designed an industrial   and is now working on designing an AC biker helmet,   Kaundinya, co-founder and CEO Jarsh told STOI. While the industrial helmet with a two-hour battery life is priced at Rs 5,000, the eight-hour battery life one sports a tag of Rs 5,500. 
 
 What's more, the start-up, which is supported by the Telangana government promoted RICH, has already found takers for its pilot sales in the Indian Navy (dockyard workers) and   (for workers at its Lucknow plant) and hopes to begin commercial production of industrial AC helmets soon, Kausthub said, adding that the 1,000 helmets per month facility will be coming up at Medchal by March end this year.
 
 Jarsh, which stands for Just A Rather Safe Helmet and is inspired by Jarvis (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) from Iron Man, gifted one to KTR on the sidelines of BioAsia2018 and said it will be donating 20 helmets to Hyderabad Traffic Police in April.
 
 Meanwhile, a city-based B Tech dropout-turned-micro artist  , who etches out figures on the tip of pencils, gifted KTR a pink pencil with his initials on it.
