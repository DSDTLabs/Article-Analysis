MUMBAI: A day after DIG (prisons)  's text messages, supporting the six jail staff arrested for   inmate Manju Shetye's murder was widely reported, Sathe has offered to quit the inquiry she was heading. The probe into Shetye's murder and the rioting inside Byculla jail will now be conducted by IG (prisons) Rajwardhan Sinha.

 Sources said Sinha, while conducting the inquiry , will have to take help from women cops to record the statements of inmates of Byculla jail.
 
 TOI in its July 7 edition reported that the DIG was seeking support for her arrested colleagues on a WhatsApp group. Sathe made headlines after she sent out text messages on the group consisting of senior jail officials, including Sinha and Thane jail superintendent Hiralal Jadhav , referring to the six arrested jail staffers as `sisters' and urging colleagues to garner support for the accused. Shetye's brother Anand Shetye strongly reacted to Sathe's text messages, seeking stern action against her.
 
 Sathe on Friday submitted a letter to IG (prisons) B K Upadhyaya, stating that in the wake of the controversy surrounding her text messages it would not be proper for her to continue with the inquiry and hence she wanted to withdraw from the probe. Sathe was supposed to complete the inquiry and submit her findings to the home department.
 
 Interestingly , minutes after she submitted the signed letter to Upadhyaya, it was out on social media. Sources said Sathe may face disciplinary action. Meanwhile opposition leader Dhananjay Munde has demanded Sathe's suspension.
 
 Shetye died on June 23 after allegedly being assaulted by prison authorities at Byculla jail. One of the messages posted on the WhatsApp group by Sathe read: “ All our 6 coullege (sic) sister arrested today evening. PC till 7th July ...“ adding minutes later, “Dhamne sir, Desai sir, we all jail authorities and staff should give moral support to our sisters (sic).“
