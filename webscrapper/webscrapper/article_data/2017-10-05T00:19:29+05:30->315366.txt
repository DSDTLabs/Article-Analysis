New Delhi: There was one   not quite elated at the Delhi assembly passing the Bill to make guest teachers permanent employees on Wednesday. Several aspiring teachers protested against the government’s decision and even engaged in verbal exchanges with the happy guest teachers outside the assembly. The aspirants held banners claiming that many of the beneficiaries had not cleared the Central Teacher Eligibility Test. A common entrance test would be a better method of ensuring capable educators, they said.

 “We demand reconsideration of the decision to regularise the appointment of 15,000 guest teachers because it will be doing injustice to us,” said one of them. Others claimed that the state government was intent on regularisation “only because this was a poll promise” and not to improve the education system.
 
 Ujwal Singh, who takes tuition classes to manage household expenses, admitted that guest teachers were recruited on merit, but alleged that “there are many fake application forms but no verification is done by the school principals”.
 
 Another protestor, Avinash Misra, said that it has been five years since he earned his teaching degree (BEd), but he is yet to find employment. “The only reason I am still fighting for my right is because I care for the profession and want to help students,” he said.
 
 Amit Kumar, 39, has been taking care of his three children with his meagre income as a tutor. “I am more than qualified to become a teacher,” he asserted. “There are many guest teachers who are yet to clear the CTET exam, but it is people like us who remain unemployed.”
 
 The dissenting group demanded a common competitive exam through which “only capable teachers are chosen in a transparent manner”. Some of them charged government recruiters with showing favouritism and said there were even cases of nepotism in the process.
