INDORE: Audhyogik Kendra Vikas Nigam ( ) has again missed the deadline for supplying water from   water link to industries of  . 

 AKVN had earlier proposed to start water supply early May in some pockets of Pithampur but still supply from much-awaited project looks far away from reach of the industries. Sources said water supply from Narmada Kshipra link is unlikely to start before June 15. Industries in Pithampur face acute water shortage every summer due to depletion of water levels in   dam and Sanjay Jalashay, the main source of water to industries. 
 
 "The work for electrical connections and canal crossing is underway at Pithampur. We are hopeful to start the project soon," said AKVN official. The official said, "We hope to supply at least 15 MLD by June 15." At present the department is giving water to industries through hydrant that is also unlikely to last long due to depleting water levels in the city. 
 
 Initially AKVN will supply non-treated raw water to industries due to lack of water treatment plant (WTP). 
 
 Industries are banking on the   link project, announced in 2011, to meet the water requirement. The link is likely to provide around 90 MLD of water to industries.
