BHOPAL: Home minister Bhupendra Singh’s bizarre statements on Padmaavat continue. After talking of the “ban” on the movie in MP all week, on Thursday he suddenly said there was no ban on it in the state.

 “The   government has nowhere banned the screening of the movie. Police are alert all over the state and monitoring law and order in view of public protests. We will not allow anyone to affect law and order in the state,” Singh told reporters after a meeting with chief minister on the controversy.
 
 While government spokesperson   said the administration is “clear that the time isn’t right for screening the movie”, Madhya Pradesh chief secretary   said that the release of Padmaavat is “not in the hands of the state government as the matter is sub-judice”.
 
 “Distributors were given rights to take a decision. As of now there is no ban on the movie in the state,” he said. “Those who want to show the movie are welcome. We will make all the arrangements since there is no ban on screening of the film in the state,” the chief secretary told reporters on the sidelines of Voters’ Day programme.
 
 The home minister said the government is alert and keeping a watch on those who are opposing the film. “The government is ready to provide security if the theatre owners wanted to screen the movie. It is they who have decided not to release the movie,” he said, adding: “Law and order is the state’s priority and police have been instructed to act strictly against those violating rules or taking law in their hands, said Singh.
 
 Making it clear that the state will not entertain any disruptive activity, B P Singh said: “We have informed district authorities to keep a vigil during the protests. We will not allow deterioration of law and order,” said Singh.
