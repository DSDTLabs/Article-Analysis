Actor  , whose movie ‘Vikram Vedha’ released in 2017 to critical acclaim, in a web series launch has reportedly confirmed that the movie would be remade in Hindi and that it would be made this year itself. The actor, however, did not reveal the cast, saying that it was too early to take a call on deciding roles.

 At the recent trailer launch of ‘Breathe’-- the web series that also stars   and Sapna Pabbi, Madhavan reportedly said, "  is definitely being remade this year and that’s for sure".
 
 The actor, responding to queries on the Tamil movie that figured in  's 'Top 10 Indian Movies of 2017', added that it was too "premature" for him to comment on who would play the main role. "Some actor who will give us a great date and an enormous market. But it is too premature for me to talk about it," the ' ' actor said. This comes at a time when there were reports earlier suggesting that   might play the lead. The claims were, however, dismissed later.
 
 "I don’t know whether I will be doing it also, because it is actually a burden of love more than a creative call. I have always shied away from remaking my own stuff in a different language, except from 'Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein'. But I can assure you that it is being made this year for sure,” the actor is reported to have added about the possibility of a 'Vikram Vedha' remake.
 
 'Vikram Vedha' is a thriller film written and directed by   and Gayathri that features Madhavan and   as an earnest police officer and a notorious don from North Chennai respectively.
