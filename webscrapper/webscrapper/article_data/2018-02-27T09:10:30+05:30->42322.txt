CHANDIGARH: Keeping old wine in new bottle, Chandigarh   gave a go-ahead to a proposal for seeking a Rs 910.76-crore budget from the   administration for the 2018-19 financial year. Of this amount, Rs 653.51 crore has been kept under revenue segment, while Rs 257.25 crore has been earmarked under capital segment.
