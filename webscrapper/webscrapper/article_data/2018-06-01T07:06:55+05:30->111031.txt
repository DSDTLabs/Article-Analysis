BARNALA: The   residents have sought the removal of   chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD) Chanda Kochhar’s portrait from the graffiti display on a flyover on the Zirakpur-Bathinda national highway (NH) near Barnala. The display - based on the ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ theme – showcases inspiring women achievers and Kocchar is currently facing allegations of financial impropriety, say the residents.

 Paintings of Lata Mangeshkar, Amrita Pritam, Kalpana Chawla, P T Usha, MC Mary Kom, Malala Yousafzai, Mrinalini Sarabhai, Mahashweta Devi and some others were put on the flyover in November-December 2017. The pictures of the achievers were put with an aim to inspire young girls to learn from their achievements and to follow them.
 
 “The paintings of high achievers, many of which are icons, were very inspiring. Since some allegations have been levelled against Chanda, we want her painting to be removed. This could be put again if she comes clean. As of now it is becoming an eyesore,” said Khushpreet, a local resident who is pursuing masters in history.
 
 “We see these women as icons. If any one of them is mired in some controversy and that too about financial matters, we should rethink about their legacy for the younger generations. I am of the view that her portrait should be removed from the display,” said Meera (21), who is a final year student of BA.
 
 When contacted, Barnala deputy commissioner Dharampal Gupta said, “The administration will look into it. The portrait may be replaced with another high achiever.”
