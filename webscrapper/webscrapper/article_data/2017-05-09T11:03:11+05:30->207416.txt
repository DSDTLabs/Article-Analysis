CHANDIGARH: Responding positively to the demand of the Punjab unit for more authority, AAP's central leadership on Monday decided to form a separate political affairs committee (PAC) for the state to help "the state unit take independent decisions on political affairs pertaining to the state." 

 Headed by party convener  , the central PAC, which met in Delhi, also decided to appoint four vice-presidents in Punjab. The two incumbents will be from   region and one each from Doaba and   regions. 
 
 Of late, the state unit and its NRI supporters have been asking for more muscle to take independent decisions. However, even as the party tried to do a balancing act by handing over the state unit to its star campaigner in assembly elections Bhagwant Mann and naming   as co-president, party insiders said a section of the leadership would be sulking. 
 
 "While senior leader HS Phoolka seems content as leader of the opposition for now, Sukhpal Singh Khaira was a key contender for the post. Besides, supporters of Gurpreet Singh Waraich (Ghuggi) were expecting he would stay on or at least be rehabilitated," said a party leader.
 
 As regards the appointments, the PAC approved them after a marathon meeting with MLAs, zone in charge and heads of frontal organizations of the Punjab unit of party. The national leadership also held one-on-one and collective discussions with MLAs and other office bearers before taking final decisions, said a party spokesperson.
 
 Opinion was sought from state leaders on how to move on after the poll debacle. The party would take holistic approach towards all issues to refurbish the base in Punjab, said the leader. He said that AAP would launch a fresh offensive against the   government.
