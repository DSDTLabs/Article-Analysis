CHANDIGARH: A park in   right adjacent to Sector 38 (west) which is usually meant for children to play and for adults and senior citizens to walk has become an inaccessible garbage dump.

 A large park that is located on the outskirts of the   Colony facing Sector 38 (west) and Sector 39 dividing road has turned into a makeshift dumping ground with heaps of rotting domestic waste strewn all over the ground belonging to the village.
 
 The open ground, which can easily be used for benefit of numerous children from the colony who do not have an access to an open field for playing is now choked with garbage and animal faeces which has raised a strong stink in the locality. It has even made passing through the spot problematic. “People don’t think before disposing of garbage at this spot. Once it started getting thrown there, the spot became a dumping site and there was no stopping. The pile of garbage is so huge that it is impossible to expect that it will be cleaned overnight. But authorities should take issue up as it is not a designated dumping spot,” said Sugandha, a DMC resident. 
 
 Waste remains strewn all over the place which includes plastic waste such as wrappers of eatables, plastic bottles and bags that have clogged the ground in more ways than one. The number of stray dogs has also increased due to the huge amount of food waste thrown in the open, thus making it a more unfavourable place for residents to roam around. 
 
 As a reason behind this menace, several residents complained about a constant lack of safai-karamcharis to clean the spot.
