MUMBAI: The quality of   soured considerably in FY18 with Rs 3 lakh crore worth of bonds being downgraded compared to Rs 1.7 lakh crore in FY17. Over half the downgrades were of papers issued by lenders, of which 70% pertained to bonds issued by   (PSBs).

 Going by the number of entities upgraded versus the number of downgrades, FY18 presents a positive image with 646 upgrades by rating agency   versus 418 downgrades. But the volume reveals the overall quality of total outstanding debt in the country.
 
 As against the Rs 3 lakh crore of downgrades, the volume of debt upgraded in FY18 was only Rs 1.8 lakh crore - up 17% from Rs 1.5 lakh crore in the previous year. The largest proportion of debt rated by ICRA (65%) continues to remain concentrated in the sub-investment grade category. A bulk of the ratings have an 'ICRA B' rating, while the median rating category is 'ICRA BB'. Fund managers consider BBB and above as an investment-grade rating, while those with lower ratings are considered speculative.
 
 PSBs, which were hit by bad debt provisions as the RBI tightened income-recognition norms, accounted for a third of downgrade volumes. According to ICRA, the overall quality of Indian debt could worsen in FY19. ICRA head of credit policy   said in a webinar, "The default rate could go up in fiscal year 2019 on higher interest cost, deteriorating business conditions and likely difficulty in getting bank funding, given the challenges in the banking system." ICRA said, looking ahead, credit quality pressures will "take longer to dissipate" as hardening interest rates and banking sector woes will create hindrances for businesses.
 
 According to ICRA, telecom, chemicals and healthcare saw weakening performance along with greater number of downgrades than upgrades.
