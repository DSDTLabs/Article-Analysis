TRICHY: Two more delta farmers have died reportedly due to crop failure, one from Nagapattinam who committed suicide and the other from Trichy who died of cardiac arrest, on Sunday. In Nagapattinam, R Panneerselvam, 52, committed suicide by hanging himself while a farmer from Manapparai in Trichy reportedly died of cardiac arrest on Saturday night. 

 Panneerselvam, a farmer of   village near Thirukkuvalai taluk in Nagapattinam, had committed suicide at his house on Sunday. Crop failure was stated to be the reason. 
 
 He had taken up samba cultivation under direct sowing method, in three acres of lease land owned by   temple in Thirukkuvalai. As his 70-day crop started to wither, he had been very upset for the last few days. He committed suicide after returning from his farmland on Sunday evening. 
 
 On the basis of a complaint lodged by the victim's brother R Ganesan, Thirukuvalai police registered a case and are investigating. According to Ganesan, he had borrowed a loan from cooperative society apart from Rs 1 lakh from a private financier.
 
 While in Trichy, Azhagarsami, 38, of   village near Manapparai, had left his 5 acre land uncultivated owing to shortage of water and was running a grocery shop and rearing five cows. His family members claimed that he died of cardiac arrest since he kept worrying about the cattle as he could not feed them properly because of the drought. He is survived by wife, two sons and a daughter.
