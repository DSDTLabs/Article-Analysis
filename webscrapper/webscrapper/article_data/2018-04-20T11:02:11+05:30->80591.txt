LUCKNOW: The premature retirement of senior IAS officer   is likely to trigger a reshuffle in the state’s top bureaucracy.

 Singh, who holds the post of agriculture production commissioner, is expected to assume charge as chairman of   once the UP government clears his application for VRS. While Singh’s retirement is due in July, he had applied for VRS on April 10 so that he could take up the new assignment.
 
 Sources in the appointments department said that since Singh does not require central deputation, his VRS application may not need DoPT nod and can be examined and finalized by the state itself.
 
 The top bureaucrat is likely to take up the office of the chairman of the commission by the end of this month, though a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court on the composition of the commission, which does not have a legal expert as a member.
 
 Once Singh demits office, a race would also begin within the IAS cadre, with two additional chief secretary rank officers — Sanjay Agarwal and Rajiv Kapoor — being tipped for the top post of APC. While another officer,   is also in the list, he may not be considered on health grounds. Kapoor too might not make it as he has rarely been on key positions in the past in the state.
 
 However, a decision on the new APC can be taken once a choice is made over the new chief secretary in place of the incumbent  , who is likely to retire in June if he does not get an extension. Kumar and Devendra Chaudhary are of 1981 batch. Chaudhary at present is chairman of UPSRTC and is likely to retire in May.
 
 In the seniority list of 1982 batch for the chief secretary’s post, Pravir Kumar and   are on the top, followed by Saniv Sharan, Chanchal Tewari and Hari Raj Kishore, then Rajiv Kapoor of 1983 batch, followed by DS Mishra, Anoop Pandey and Sanjay Agarwal of 1984 batch.
