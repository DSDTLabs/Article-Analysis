Ghaziabad: Ghaziabad police have decided to register FIRs and take legal action against those found trespassing onto the   Elevated Road, which is yet to be thrown open to the public. 

 The directive by SSP Hari Narayan Singh was issued after   officials last week discovered that names had been scribbled on the freshly-tarred surface of the bridge, which is awaiting a clearance from the environment ministry, with the help of spray paints.
 
 “Directions have been issued to police stations having jurisdiction over the elevated road to maintain vigilance. Anyone trying to trespass onto the road or defacing it is liable to be punished under appropriate provisions of the law,” Singh said.
 
 The police are conducting an investigation into the defacement of the road surface and the GDA has stepped up vigil at all the four entry and exit points of the 10.3km stretch from UP Gate to Raj Nagar Extension. Steel barricades are also being placed at night to prevent the entry of vehicles.
 
 Officials said on Tuesday the environment ministry could issue the clearance for the road anytime soon, following which it would be open for vehicles.
 
 “The matter is listed before the violations committee of the Union environment ministry. We had made a presentation in front of the committee on January 30 highlighting various facts of the case. The committee is likely to send its clearance, if at all, to the National Green Tribunal, where a case is pending against the project for alleged environmental violations during the construction of the elevated road,” GDA chief engineer VN Singh said.
 
 There have been allegations that some portions of the land acquired for the project belonged to the Hindon bird sanctuary. The construction of the elevated road had started during the reign of the Samajwadi Party in 2014. The work was completed on the road in the recent past after the SP was voted out of power.
