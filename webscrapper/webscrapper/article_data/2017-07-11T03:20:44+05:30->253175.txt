MUMBAI: Two-hundred-and-sixty-three policemen and government   from various departments travelled illegally in   compartments meant for   and cancer patients in the last six months.

 Divisional security commissioner, railway, Sachin Bhalode recently wrote to the   commissioner and the Government Railway police (GRP) seeking take stern action against these policemen. Sources said that Bhalode sent around 40 letters to various government departments with a list of names of 263 officials, mostly from the city police and the GRP, who used the reserved coaches.
 
 “We have been carrying out special drives and have caught several government officials for travelling in these coaches and we keep sending notices to departments concerned to take suitable action,” Bhalode said. “We have taken departmental action against those whose names have been sent to us. We will take stern action against if they do it a second time.”
 
 Activist Sameer Zaveri said Nitin Gaikwad, a handicapped person, had filed complaints as well as a writ petition in the high court. 
 
 In 2013, Gaikwad was beaten by a police officer after he asked the officer why he had entered the reserved compartment. 
 
 Gaikwad had filed a petition before the Commissioner for Persons With Disability, which ordered the installation of CCTVs besides the posting of special officers and holding of awareness campaigns to check illegal entry in these compartments. 
 
 “However, this order was never complied with and hence I filed a writ petition in the high court. In January, the high court directed the home department and the DGP to initiate disciplinary action against policemen booked for travelling in compartments reserved for the   and cancer patients in Mumbai’s suburban trains,” advocate Jaideep Tanna, who represents Gaikwad, said. He said the authorities failed to initiate any action.
