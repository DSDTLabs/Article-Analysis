Kadapa: The death of two youths has kicked up a storm in Pulivendula town, Kadapa district on Wednesday. While police termed the death of a youth as murder, they are yet to ascertain the cause behind the death of another. 

 But speculation is rife that both the youths have been killed for the same reason. Challa Ashok (25) was found dead with injuries on his head and police suspect a woman and her husband behind the murder. Eight years ago, he got married to the woman, Karimunnisa whom he courted, but the marriage broke after six months. Later, Karimunnisa married another man, Nagaraju. However, Ashok started pressing her to come back by calling or sending her text messages. The woman, irritated with this act, informed her husband, Nagaraju the matter on Tuesday. 
 
 Nagaraju went to Ashok’s residence and told his mother about the issue. The angry Ashok, in inebriated state, visited Nagaraju’s house and confronted him. In the second incident, MD Khadar Bhasha (23) was also found dead near ring road. Police are waiting for the post-mortem report to ascertain the cause of his death.
