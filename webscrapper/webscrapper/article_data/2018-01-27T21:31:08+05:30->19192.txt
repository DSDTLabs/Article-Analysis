JAIPUR:   personalities rallied behind director   and his controversial film ‘Padmaavat’ on Friday, saying freedom of expression was “sacrosanct”. 

 Interacting with the media at the  , film-maker Vishal Bhardwaj reiterated that he stood with the director. “Bhansali made a movie within the law. There is nothing illegal about it,” he said. On the violent protests against the film’s screening, he said, “It is the elected government that constitutes the censor board. 
 
 
 
 The board showed the movie to a panel (of experts), which raised certain objections and the producers addressed them. After that nobody has a right to resort to violent protests.” He condemned the attack on a school bus in Gurugaon. The film-maker added that Bollywood personalities who were now in politics must show their support to Bhansali. 
 
 He said it was “scary” that people were taking the law into their hands even after the   (SC) had cleared the release of ‘Padmaavat’. “People are... getting away with it. It is very scary that law enforcement agencies are not able to perform their duties and impose the SC order,” said Bhardwaj. Actor   said a handful of people could not decide what the rest of the country read or watched. “There are democratic ways to express your opinion. 
 
 There are movies that I don’t like but I don’t resort to vandalism. If I don’t like some movie, I don’t go to watch it,” she said. “A society can only progress when there is a space to agree and disagree with each other,” Das added. Film-maker Anurag Kashyap said people in Rajasthan, which has witnessed extensive protests over the film, were victims of “oppression of pride”. 
 
 Sharing anecdotes from his research in the state for the critically acclaimed movie ‘Gulaal’ (2009), involving “extensive interactions with locals, including many erstwhile royals”, he said, “I found people here living in the past and... not ready to progress.”
