HYDERABAD: Actor and   ( ) leader   on Wednesday said that despite raising his voice on many issues pertaining to AP, it was not being heard. “I have realised this. People are also losing trust in TDP,” he said.

 Pawan Kalyan sought the assistance of   leader   and former   MP   to join him and understand what was due from the Centre for AP after the state’s bifurcation.
 
 He said that he had supported Narendra Modi in the 2014 elections and hoped justice would be done to AP. He regretted not contesting the 2014 elections. “Had we contested the polls and won, we would have been able to pressurise the government,” he said. He supported the bandh called by Left parties on February 8 against the neglect of AP in the budget.
