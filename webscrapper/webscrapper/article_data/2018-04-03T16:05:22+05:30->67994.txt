CHENNAI: Taking partymen and police by surprise,   chief minister   and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam on Tuesday led ruling AIADMK's hunger strike here demanding setting up of the   management board. 

 Palaniswami and Panneerselvam arrived at the venue -- Chepauk near Marina Beach -- around 8am. Their names were not on the list of leaders participating in the hunger strike. Their participation has come in the backdrop of opposition parties stepping up protests across the state.
 
 “We had not been aware of the participation of the chief minister and the deputy chief minister until they turned up,” a senior police official said.
 
 Taken aback by the leaders at the venue, the district functionaries and minister D Jayakumar rushed to the fasting venue. Party presidium chairman E Madhusudanan arrived at 8.45am, followed by scores of party members and functionaries. 
 
 Traffic was disrupted on the Wallajah Road due to the hunger strike at Chepauk.
 
 Ministers and senior leaders were taking part in protests in district headquarters.
 
  The party is demanding that the BJP government at the Centre set up the Cauvery management board and the Cauvery water regulation committee immediately, establish the rights of Tamil Nadu over the Cauvery water and safeguard the interests of the state.
 
 Meanwhile, DMK working president M K Stalin called the AIADMK hunger strike a drama. Stalin said the AIADMK government had failed to exert pressure on the central government to constitute the Cauvery management board and it was a enacting a drama in the form of a hunger strike to cover up its failure.
