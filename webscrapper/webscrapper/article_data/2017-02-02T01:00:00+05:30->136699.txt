Sony Sab’s sci-fi comedy show will get a new twist with Mr. X ( ) revealing his true identity. The faceless villain, Mr. X, who continuously gets defeated by Yo-Man ( ) decides to take revenge by confronting him in person. 
 In the upcoming track, Mr. X will devise a new plan to beat Yo-Man and extort money from the citizens of the city. He creates an army of tiny robotic mosquitoes, whose bite causes the victim to laugh uncontrollably and become breathless, and fall sick. People in the city are terrified by the swarm of mosquitoes. Mr. X starts extorting money from the people in return of the cure. The doctors and scientists in the city are baffled as they are unable to find a cure for the disease. Yo-Man encounters the mosquitoes too but they are unable to affect him, which makes Mr. X angry. 
  In a quest to find a solution, Yo-Man catches a mosquito and seeks help from Professor   ( ). Professor Agarwal hacks into a transmission dish antenna and turns it into a strong electromagnet. Yo-Man lures the mosquitoes into its range and escapes himself. The mosquitoes are destroyed by the intense magnetic field. The people in the city are happy but their happiness is short lived because Mr. X launches double the number of mosquitoes with a vengeance. 
  Yo-Man gets worried and now the only option left is to face Mr. X and steal his remote control through which he controls the mosquitoes. 
  Aniruddh Dave said, “With his evil plans, Mr. X tries to destroy the city and extort money from the people. Yo-Man tries to eradicate the mosquitoes but in vain. Finally, when he sees no solution he decides to come face-to-face with Mr. X. It will be interesting to see their confrontation.”
