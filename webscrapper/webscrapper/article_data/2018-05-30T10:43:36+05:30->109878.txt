LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party national president   Yadav said on Tuesday that the snag-riddled EVMs are the biggest threat to democracy and malfunctioning of machines during   and Noorpur bypolls was BJP’s strategy to hamper polling in SP and RLD strongholds. He called upon all opposition parties to launch a campaign against use of EVMs and demand that paper ballot be used in 2019 elections.

 
 “Earlier, neither Election Commission nor   accepted that the machines were prone to snags but now both have admitted that there was large scale malfunctioning of EVMs and VVPATs,” the former CM said.
 
 He also questioned EC’s claims that machines developed snag because of high temperature. “How come the temperature was high only at booths where strength of SP and RLD was more?”
 
 “Such instances are eroding the faith of people in EVMs and officials are not taking it seriously. This is a dangerous trend for democracy,” said Akhilesh adding that now only use of ballot paper can restore faith and confidence of people.
 
 “Ballot paper use will strengthen democracy. I will again ask other parties to demand that EVMs are not used in next elections,” the SP chief.
 
 “When I had convened a meeting earlier to discuss the EVM issue,   party did not attend. Now they have also raised the issue. I will consult other parties and decide how do we take this forward,” he said.
 
 The SP chief also attacked PM   for his road show on Delhi-Meerut Expressway on May 27 stating that it was an attempt to influence the Kairana byelection. “The PM in his address talked about quota within quota. We welcome the move and appeal to the PM to first get a census done to determine the count of backwards and most backwards and then go ahead with quota on the basis of their population,” he said. Responding to a media query, the SP chief said he is willing to contest next Lok Sabha election but the party will decide the seat.
