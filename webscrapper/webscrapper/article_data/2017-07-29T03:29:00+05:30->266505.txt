Panaji: The Goa Human Rights Commission (GHRC) has called upon North Goa superintendent of police (SP) asking that appropriate directions be issued to police officials working in the district to provide fair and proper treatment to people approaching them with genuine problems and to file complaints accordingly.  In its inquiry report on Friday, the commission stated that police officials should not insult or humiliate parties who appear before them with genuine grievances. “People are losing faith in the police machinery on account of their arrogant behaviour while dealing with the public. Police officials should show courtesy and be people friendly.” The observations were made after a resident of Batti Vaddo, Nerul, Preetha Nair filed a complaint with the commission stating that police had not taken seriously her grievance about harassment by a builder over a water supply issue.  Nair stated that her family faces a water problem as the builder locks the wooden box of the main switch of the water pump.  Nair’s daughter has stated that she was threatened and abused after she and her father went down to the water sump, and that when she called the Betim police station, they didn’t show any seriousness and instead, asked her to come to the police station with a written complaint. The commission has issued notices to the head constable in charge of the Betim police station, the PI of Porvorim police station and SP North among others. The commission stated that Nair’s allegations appear to be serious in nature, but noted that the complainant directly approached the commission before filing a police complaint.  “It appears that initially the police did not register complaints filed by the parties, including registering complaints as N/C complaints where the complaints are non-cognizable in nature,” the commission stated, adding, “We hope and trust that in the future police will take prompt action.”
