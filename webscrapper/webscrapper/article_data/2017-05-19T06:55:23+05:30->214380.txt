NAGPUR. Continuing with its series of staging one-act plays every month to hone skills of budding artistes,   (SBF), a non-profit live theatre organization, is coming up with its 25th presentation ‘Aastha aani Gavaarichi Bhaaji’ on Sunday.

 Based on Meghna Pethe’s story, the play has been produced by Anita Bhakre, directed by Prakash Lunge, written by Santosh Verulkar, and will be presented by Ashish Dongre, Raakhi Vaidya, Pratik Gaan, and Himani Ballal. It will be staged at Sai Sabhagruha in Shankar Nagar. 
 
 SBF started one act plays in June 2014. The last 24 plays have received an overwhelming response. Sanjay Bhakre, founder, said, “Our objective is to mould raw theatre talents into professional artists. We teach them everything from stage presence to voice modulation.”
 
 SBF focuses on all the departments of theatre, like direction, writing, music, and lights.Personalities like Arunkaka Kakde of  , writer Raajan Baane, theatre artistes Nikhil Ratnaparkhi, Shantanu Moghe, Yogesh Soman, Vivek Garud, Ajit Divadkar and Anil Chanakhekar have been part of this journey.
 
 SBF has been a crucial guidance point for 70-80 artistes not just from the city but all over Maharashtra. They practise at Gajanan Nagar and organize plays at community halls since theatres are expensive and it’s a free school for budding talents.
