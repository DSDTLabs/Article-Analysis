LUCKNOW: BSP chief   will hold a cadre camp at   in New Delhi on Sunday. She has also invited members of Backward and   (BAMCEF), the organisation established by   in 1978.

 Mayawati rarely holds a cadre camp personally and instead prefers sending other senior party leaders to villages to convert supporters into party cadres. The practice of holding cadre camps was initiated by Kanshi Ram, who used to hold public meetings in villages away from public glare.
 
 Party sources said Mayawati may make a few announcements regarding her future political course at the cadre camp.
 
 “Mayawati is going back to the basic political strategy of consolidating her core dalit vote bank. The decision to organise a cadre camp is also part of that strategy,” said a senior BSP leader. Following a string of electoral defeats, starting from 2014 parliamentary elections, the BSP supremo has realised that she needs to consolidate her core dalit vote bank that drifted heavily towards BJP in the Lok Sabha elections.
 
 The involvement of BAMCEF gains significance as it has spilt many times since Kanshi Ram’s death in 2006. When BSP engineered a dalit-upper caste combination, the move caused divisions among BSP and BAMCEF functionaries.
