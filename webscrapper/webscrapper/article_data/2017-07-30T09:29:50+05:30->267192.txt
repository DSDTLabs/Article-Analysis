KOLKATA: Misery may not have ended for residents of Indian Mirror Street, which saw two deaths in a house collapse earlier this week. More such ancient, dilapidated buildings in the vicinity may face a similar tragic fate in absence of proper maintenance. A case in point is the building just next to 10, Indian Mirror Street, which crumbled on Tuesday. Though you would otherwise not spare it a second glance and mentally tick the owners off, you will have to stop by if you knew that this was the house where screen goddess Nargis was born and raised.

 Eight years ago, the building came into limelight when actor Sanjay Dutt visited 8, Indian Mirror Street to pay his respects to his mother and maternal grandmother who lived in this house for many years. Today, the building has no clear owner though in the KMC records, property tax is collected in the name of  , an associate of Nargis’s mother  . 
 
 According to sources, KMC had served a notice long back but tenants showed no interest in getting the repair work done. The ground-floor room where Nargis was born is damp and dark and serves as a godown-cum-living quarters of the Anand family. “Repair will take a lot of money and since there is no clear owner, we don’t know who to approach,” said Sanjib Anand. The tenants have not paid any rent for many years for lack of a clear owner after caretaker of the building,  , passed away. 
 
 The wood is rotting in the staircase leading to the first floor where Uttam Sett lives with his family. The rear side of the building shows cracks. Signs of water seepage is evident on every wall. Chunks have started falling off. Since Tuesday’s mishap, many KMC engineers have been inspecting the old buildings on the street and renewing their notices. The Sett family, however, did not answer the door bell despite repeated efforts. “They are avoiding KMC officials for fear that they might be asked to vacate the building,” said  , another tenant.
