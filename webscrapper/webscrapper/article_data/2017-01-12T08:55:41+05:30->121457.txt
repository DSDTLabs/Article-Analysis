AHMEDABAD: This year the UK brought one of the largest  , 35 companies, to the   with a clear focus on life sciences. British high commissioner to India,  , who is leading the delegation said the acquisition of Actavis UK Ltd and Actavis Ireland Ltd by Gujarat-based Intas   was a catalyst to a closer association with Gujarat. The British high commissioner also said that British life sciences companies are also looking at greater collaboration with Indian companies in clinical trials, for development of new drugs that suit the market in India.

  Asquith explained that at the CEO forum during the India-UK Tech summit last November, there was greater emphasis on developing collaborations on clinical trials for developing new drugs. “The UK-India CEOs discussed how they can collaborate on clinical trials to get discovered medicines to the market quicker. Both British and Indian companies are working on that,” said Asquith. He added, “There are talks on about ways to collaborate during phase 1 and phase 2 of clinical trials between Indian and UK companies.”
 
 “In Britain, there are 5,500 companies in the life sciences sector generating 60 billion pounds each year. Gujarat’s role in the Indian pharma industry is one of the largest and the most significant. It makes sense to be here,” said Asquith. He added, “Gujarat’s   for instance is working closely with their British counterparts on real challenges facing us. For instance, anti-microbial drug resistance, precision medicine and collaborating in industrial biotechnology. UK is one of the best innovators in this field. You see, 25 of every 100 prescription drugs in the world today were developed in UK,” says Asquith.
