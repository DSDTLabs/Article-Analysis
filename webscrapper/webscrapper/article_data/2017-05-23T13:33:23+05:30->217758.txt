MUMBAI: In an   to 40 first-year students pursuing a degree in optometry, a   of   allowed them to appear for the   which is slated to start on Tuesday. 

 The HC was hearing a petition by Lotus College of Optometry, which has been offering students a BSc degree in Optometry, for a decade. The course was affiliated to an open university. But last year, the University Grants Commission sought to bar the affiliation on the grounds that the subject would come under the purview of the medical council.
 
 The state government told the college that it cannot run the course under the present affiliation and hence the college moved court. 
 
 Last December, the students were also allowed by the high court to appear for the first-semester examination, but when they were denied hall tickets for the second semenster too, the college moved the vacation bench.
