BATHINDA: Taking up the appeal filed against his acquittal in an assault case, the   sessions judge has asked   (SAD) president   Singh Badal to appear before him on March 15. The appeal was filed in the sessions court after the former deputy CM was acquitted in the case of assaulting a   resident Naresh Sehgal, a former journalist, on April 2, 2016.

 Sehgal had alleged that he was assaulted by Sukhbir on September 5, 1999, while the latter was campaigning during Lok Sabha elections at Kotkapura and contesting from Faridkot parliamentary constituency. He alleged Sukhbir had beaten him when he had clicked some pictures of Sukhbir campaigning at some religious place in violation of the code of conduct for elections. 
 
 The case against Sukhbir was registered in 2006 on the directions of the   and   high court.
