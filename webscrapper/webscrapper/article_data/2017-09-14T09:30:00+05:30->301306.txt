Bejoy Nambiar's Dulquer Salmaan-starrer film ' ' is an anthology, in which Dulquer plays a handful of characters based on the various 'bhavas' of Lord Shiva. 

 Earlier, the crew had released songs and posters of two of the versions, Shiva and Rudra. Now, the 'World of Shekhar,' probably the funkiest of the lot, is out and Dulquer himself shared it on his social media page sometime back. With some long messy locks and a 'Kali' look on his face, it's an easy guess as to what the character type might be.
 
 Shekhar also has a pretty yet feisty Radhika in his life, played by actress Dhansika. The actress was previously part of Rajinikanth's Pa.Ranjith film 'Kabali.'
