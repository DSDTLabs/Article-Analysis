RANCHI/DUMKA: The   factor is looming large over Littipara by-polls. The Prime Minister’s scheduled visit to Sahebganj on April 6 was taken up in the Rajya Sabha by   MP Sanjiv Kumar on Monday. 

 The issue is likely to assume larger proportions at the upper house of Parliament during the zero hour on Tuesday, when JMM and other opposition leaders are likely to demand a reply from Modi on violation of election code of conduct during his visit. 
 
 If a reply is not received from the PM at the Rajya Sabha, JMM has threatened to stage a walkout with other opposition leaders.
 
 Former chief minister and JMM leader Hemant Soren said in Dumka on Monday: “The Prime Minister’s visit is just three days ahead of the Littipara by-election on April 9. This issue was raised by our party’s MP Sanjiv Kumar in the Rajya Sabha. This is a glaring instance of violation of the model code of conduct.” 
 
 On April 6, Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation of Ganga Bridge and port at Sahebganj. Soren accused   for ‘misusing’ the government machinery for political gains and said the Election Commission too “seems indifferent” towards JMM’s complaints. “The complaint was registered with the EC on March 23, but it is still unrequited,” Soren said. JMM shot off another letter to the EC on Monday. 
 
 Party general secretary   said: “At Sahebganj, the PM is also scheduled to distribute mobile phones among one lakh women and hand out appointment letters to the youths belonging to the primitive Paharia tribe for the newly-formed Pahariya battalion, which is part of the state’s paramilitary forces. In Littipara constituency of the 1.9 lakh voters, 27,000 voters are from the Paharia tribe. This is clearly an attempt to influence voters.”
