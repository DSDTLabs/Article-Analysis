GANDHINAGAR: Haribhai V Patel, a 1982-batch retired IAS officer and the senior-most Right to Information Commissioner, resigned on Monday after the state government appointed his much junior colleague, D P Thaker, as the Chief Information Commissioner.   was serving as the junior RTI commissioner. 

  
  
 Thaker, who has worked for more than a decade in the chief minister’s office (CMO), retired as deputy secretary. Patel, on the other hand, retired as additional chief secretary. Apart from Thaker, R R Varsani — a 1994-batch retired IAS officer — has superseded Patel.
 
 
  
 Patel on Monday met governor O P Kohli and handed his resignation in protest. Patel had also applied for the chief information commissioner’s post and considering his seniority and experience he was expecting to get the appointment. Patel was approached several times for his comment but was not available. However, a source in the commission said: “Patel decided to resign after the government ignored his seniority and experience. If the government had appointed anyone from public life he may have found that acceptable.” The source said the elevation of a much junior officer made Patel resign immediately. “In fact, Varsani may also resign because he is senior to the new chief information commissioner,” the source said. Thaker is considered to be close to BJP leaders. Thaker’s appointment has sparked major resentment in the IAS lobby because since the formation of the RTI Commission, only IAS officers have been appointed as Chief Information Commissioners. This is for the first time that an officer of the deputy secretary rank has been appointed to such a senior post.
