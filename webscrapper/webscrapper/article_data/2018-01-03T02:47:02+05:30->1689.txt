NEW DELHI:   probably suffers from a   and his murderous rampage on Monday night could have been the fallout of stress-induced violence, said mental health experts. 

  said that the six deaths could have been prevented had the people convinced Dhankar to give up the weapon immediately after his assault on his first victim. He might have agreed to calm down. Usually, in such cases, Dutta said, once the person was overpowered or pinned down, the aggression tended to peter out.
 
 “Dhankar’s rage seems to be the result of stress due to work, family and his profile in the neighbourhood,” added Dutta. “I learnt he was being shunned by everyone for his misbehaviour. He was venting his anger on his wife, but after she left him, he might have been harbouring anger about it. One needs to find out what triggered Monday’s outrage.”
 
 Psychiatrists say that when stress-induced violence takes over, it is difficult to rein in such a person. Dhankar may have been accumulating stress after having to quit the army. That is why mental health expert   said that apart from the accused’s immediate mental state, his conduct while serving in the army had to be probed too.
 
 According to Mitra, though the armed forces stringently monitored the health issues of their personnel, they often failed to consider the deleterious effect of stress on behaviour. “There have been incidents of people growing violent after retiring from the armed forces since the high level of stress they undergo refuses to ebb on retirement. If they are ignored at that point, behavioural issues begin going out of hand,” explained Mitra.
 
 Experts also said there increasingly are cases of violence whose root can be traced to stress due to high-pressure jobs. According to both Dutta and Mitra, police and the hospital authorities where Dhankar is admitted need to handle his case with some compassion.
