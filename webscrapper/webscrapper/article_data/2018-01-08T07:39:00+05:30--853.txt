Shimla: A day after he was made the pro tem speaker, BJP MLA from Jawalamukhi Ramesh Dhwala questioned the utility of holding the winter session of assembly in Dharamshala, saying the building as a white elephant.

 Dhwala was interacting with media persons when he said that he was of the opinion that for a five-six day session, such a huge amount of money should not have been incurred. The building could instead be used to run a government educational institution to benefit the public, he said.
 
 This is not the first time that the issue of maintenance cost of this building has been raised. During the previous Congress regime, then speaker B B L Butail, too, had questioned the use of having a second assembly in the state and proposed that it be out to better use. Pointing out that barring a week-long session, the building remained idle throughout the year, he had even suggested to give it for convention purposes. However, after finding that his suggestion was not in accordance with the sanctity of Vidhan Sabha, he had suggested to have an e-Vidhan Academy for which the Union government was also approached.
 
 According to the sources, a lot of money is spent on the maintenance and salary of staff deployed at the assembly at Kaned village near Dharamshala, besides boarding and lodging expenses of ministers.
 
 To bridge the gap between lower and upper Himachal, the assembly building was constructed in Dharamshala. The winter session is being held here regularly for the last 11 years.
 
 This time, the winter session would start on January 9 and would conclude on January 12. While on January 9 newly-elected MLAs are expected to take oath, on January 10 a new speaker would be elected. Meanwhile, the sources have said that on January 11, election of deputy speaker would be held.
 
 A few days ago, when chief minister Jai Ram Thakur was asked about the significance of two Vidhan Sabhas, he had said that the matter is related to the sentiments of the people.
