CHANDIGARH: Scarcity of potable   and muddy supply in some parts of the city remained the main point of discussion during the monthly house meeting of the municipal corporation on Thursday. Most of the councillors raised the issue affecting their wards and said they were paying private tankers from their pockets to provide water to residents.

 Councillor Devinder Singh Babla said, “In most of my ward, water is not available and situation has reached a point that I have to pay for private tankers.”
 
 Councillors Chandrawati Shukla and Dilip Sharma complained of contaminated and muddy water supply in their respective areas. They said the residents were not getting adequate supply and whatever they were getting was muddy, which was adding to their woes. Shukla also showed bottles of muddy water that she had brought along.
 
 Councillor Mahesh Inder Singh Sidhu said since the demand for potable water increases in summer, the authorities must focus on tertiary treated water, which the residents can use for irrigation and other non-potable uses. At present, potable water was being used for other purposes, which was leading to shortage, he added.
 
 “The residents have been complaining that there is foul smell in the tertiary treated water and therefore despite taking its connections, they are not using it,” Sidhu said.
 
 Councillors said not only on the top floors, water was not available at the ground floors too.
