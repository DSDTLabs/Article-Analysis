    also stated that Kashmiris are not slaves of India and that the country must respect their honour and dignity.
 
  "Situation has taken a dangerous turn. Little kids are ready with guns today. Terrorism will come from there (Pakistan), but if we don't provide them support, it won't be successful," Farooq told ANI.
 
  "It's our drawback that terrorism is being successful," Farooq added.
 
  The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister also urged the Centre to resolve the issues that are essentially political in nature.
 
  "The claims that demonetisation has put an end to stone pelting in the valley have fallen flat as the youth were now taking to guns. The situation, therefore, cannot be allowed to drift anymore. It called for earnest initiatives to reach out to the people," Farooq noted.
