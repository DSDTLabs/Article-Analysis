JAIPUR: A 25-year-old transgender,  , has to clear more hurdles to become the first transgender to join   police as a constable. 

 She has filed a contempt petition in the Rajasthan High Court's Jodhpur bench alleging that the state government has failed to appoint her, thus flouting the court's earlier order.
 
 "We filed the contempt petition on January 5. The HC had passed an order on November 13, 2017, directing the government to give the appointment letter to the petitioner by December 31, 2017. The government neither challenged the HC's order, nor issued the posting orders for the transgender," said  , counsel for Ganga Kumari.
 
 He said the court had ordered that if the government doesn't give job to the petitioner by December 31, then from January 1, 2018, she would be entitled to all the emoluments like salary, dearness allowance etc.
 
 Despite the HC order, Kumari's wait for the job has not ended.
 
 "If I get the constable's job, I would be the first transgender to do so in the state. My appointment would open ways for other transgenders to come into the mainstream," said Kumari.
 
 Despite clearing the written and physical tests for recruitment as a constable in the police department, she has to fight a legal battle.
 
 She said that in the medical test, she was declared a transgender. "Though I passed the written and physical tests in 2015, I was not given a posting because I am a transgender. The court provided me relief and directed the government to give me a constable's job by December 31. Yet the government has done nothing," said Kumari. She said that a total of 208 candidates were selected and she was one of them. All other 207 have got the posting orders.
