CHENNAI: The government is likely to notify on Wednesday the proposal to expand   ( ) seven-fold from 1,189sqkm to 8,878sqkm, including parts of Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts and Vellore’s Arakkonam taluk, making it the country’s second largest urban agglomeration after the National Capital Region (46,208sqkm).

 A housing and urban development department official told TOI that the government would seek public comments on the extension, meant to give infrastructure a fillip and provide uniform and regulated urban development under a single planning body  .
 
 The expanded metropolitan area will leapfrog   (8,005sqkm) and relegate Hyderabad Metropolitan Region (7,257sqkm) to the fourth largest urban cluster. Pune Metropolitan Area (6,616.79sqkm) will come in at fifth, followed by Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region (5,573sqkm).
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
  (4,355sqkm) will be seventh, though, with 20.80 million people, it ranks second only to NCR (46.05 million) in population.
 
 The government will give people two months to make suggestions on the expansion, the official said, before hurrying to plan infrastructure and transportation services and identify townships, agricultural zones and ecosensitive areas.
