PUNE: The state government has streamlined the working of   by   covering   appointments. 

 Night schools are a boon for students, especially those who want to study but have to work during the day to support themselves and their families. 
 
  The new rules will be applicable to the 176 night schools in the state which have 1,000 teachers. Till now, many teachers and non-teaching staff worked in regular schools and then continued at the night schools. 
 
 The staff not only got pay for working in regular schools according to the sixth pay commission but also got the basic salary and dearness allowance for working in night schools.
 
 The new rule says if a teacher is teaching or working in a night school, he or she is not allowed to work in private unaided regular schools. 
 
 "We don't know if it is for new recruitments or if it applies for the current staff also. We are working in both the regular schools and night schools because we have an appointment letter from the government to do so. It is government's order and if there is any change, our union will decide whether to go to court,"  , member at Maharashtra State Night School Head Masters' Association, said.
 
 The new rules also says that extra teachers, currently in the regular school system, who are paid a full salary despite them not teaching for lack of schools or students, will be appointed in night schools till a position opens up in the regular school.
 
 Bhagwan Salunkhe, teachers' constituency MLC, said, " The decision to not allow the same teachers to work in both schools is good. They draw double salary when there are so many qualified youths."
