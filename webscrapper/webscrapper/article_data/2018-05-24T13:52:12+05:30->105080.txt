The rape survivor had stayed for a few days with her sister’s family in Amroli when the accused raped her.
 
 She told police that a young man of around 25 years of age with pimple marks on his face had come to watch TV at her sister’s house when she was alone with the children. The accused talked to her for some time and then raped her.
