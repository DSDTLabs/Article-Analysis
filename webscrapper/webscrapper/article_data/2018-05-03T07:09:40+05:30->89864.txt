SYDNEY: Was it a Freudian slip by French President  ? A joke linked to French gastronomy? Or even, a week after his visit to  , a parody of President Donald Trump’s infamous comments about Macron’s wife?   raised eyebrows in Sydney on Wednesday by calling Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s wife “delicious”.

 
 Wrapping up a joint news conference during his brief Australian visit, Macron said: “I want to thank you for your welcome, thank you and your delicious wife for your warm welcome”. The comment quickly sparked some lighthearted reaction on social media and in the Australian press amid lively conjecture about the French leader’s intent. “Macron just said he wanted to thank Malcolm Turnbull and his ‘delicious wife’. You can take the man out of France but...,” tweeted Alice Workman, a journalist.
 
 Australian ‘ABC News’ tweeted, “Lost in translation: Emmanuel Macron thanks the PM’s ‘delicious wife’”.
 
 Some observers felt he may have been making a joke. Turnbull had just mentioned Macron’s imminent lunch with members of Sydney’s French community, and had followed with comments about French gastronomy and wine.
 
 Macron earlier had also been talking about shrimp, picking up on Turnbull’s comment relating to China’s growing influence in the South Pacific, when the Australian leader said that “big fish cannot eat little fish, and little fish cannot eat shrimp”.
 
 Others felt Macron may simply have slipped up in English, since the French word for delicious — delicieux — also translates as “delightful”. The more mischievous may have even considered Macron’s comment to possibly be a tongue-incheek reference to Trump’s visit to Paris last year, when he told Macron’s wife, Brigitte, that she was “in such great shape”, before looking to her husband and saying, “Beautiful”.
