NEW DELHI: Eleven  , who had been targeting people at Delhi   and railway stations, were nabbed on Thursday.

 The gang, which operated in two groups, stole mobile phones and cheated people with fake notes. One group used to approach their targets seeking change for their fake notes. Once the victim gave the amount and got the note, they realised it was only printed paper. The other group, which operated at busy Metro stations, indulged in mobile thefts.
 
 Ajay Chaudhary,   (New Delhi range) had ordered a crackdown on criminals in the Metro after several complaints of theft and cheating were registered.
 
 Pankaj Singh,  , said that a team led by inspector Rajiv Kumar scanned the footage of several Metro stations starting from Yamuna Bank to New Delhi Railway station and identified the criminals.
 
 “It was found that they travelled in the Metro from Bawana posing as executives and duped passengers when they reached the busy intersecting stations,” said DCP Singh.
 
 The accused, Rahul Kumar, Zakir, Mohd Abid, Mujammil Sheikh, Shiboo, Maksood, Chhotu Singh and Tanveer were caught from a hideout in Bawana while their three juvenile associates were apprehended from Akshardham Metro station. During interrogation, the accused told police that they were residing together at a rented room in Bawana.
