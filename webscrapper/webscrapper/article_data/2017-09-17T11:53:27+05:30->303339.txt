AMRITSAR: Pakistan's minority leadership has urged the government to take strict action against hatemongers following the recent spate in the vicious propaganda against 'Nanakpanthis' (Sindhi Hindus) in Tharparkar district of Sindh province. Most of the Hindus living in Sindh follow teachings of Sikhism and are also called 'Nanakpanthis'.

 "Not only the social media is being used to propagate hatred against the minority community , but pamphlets are also being distributed in Tharparkar," Pakistan's member of national assembly (MNA) Ramesh Kumar   told TOI over phone on Saturday . He said extremist elements were trying to create unrest in the peaceful society of Hindu-majority Mithi and Umarkot areas using anonymous social media accounts. "The hate pamphlets are written in Sindhi language and are being distributed on a large scale," he said, adding that these had the name of controversial Islamic cleric  , believed to be involved in most cases related to forced conversions of minor Hindu and Sikh girls.
 
 Stating that minority communities in Pakistan were facing a lot of problems, Vankwani, who is also the patron-in-chief of the  , expressed regret that minorities were continuously being discriminated against.
