AMRITSAR: Septuagenarian Jeeto, mother of   who was killed in  , wanted to see her two grandsons, Karan and Arjun, become a doctor and lawyer. She used all of her life savings to pay Rs 1.3 lakh to a travel agent to send Sonu, a professional cook, abroad to help improve their family’s future.

 For a few months, it was like a dream come true when Sonu told her about his job at a construction company and sent money home. A year after arriving in Iraq, he was abducted and killed.
 
 
 “I did menial jobs since Sonu’s father had died a long ago and I had the burden of bringing up four sons. I did whatever I could,” Jeeto told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 One of her sons, Hira Lal, said a travel agent promised Sonu a job in 2012. “After saving money for a year, Sonu expressed his desire to go abroad for work. Initially, we were sceptical but the family agreed. I also gave whatever money I had saved and he paid the travel agent who secured him a job in Iraq,” he said.
 
 After Sonu’s abduction, his wife Sonia began work as a housemaid or any other work she could find. Sonu’s three brothers had to look after their own families and were unable to help. Hira Lal said he had supported Sonu’s family even as he earned around Rs 250 a day.
 
 However, Jeeto’s dreams for her grandsons couldn’t be fulfilled as the family’s priorities changed after Sonu’s death.
