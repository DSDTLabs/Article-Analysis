NEW DELHI: Hitting back at the   for alleging that the   was 
  in Goa, Union Finance Minister   today said the Congress complains a bit too much. 

 In a post on social networking site  , Jaitley explained why the Congress party's claims are baseless.
 
 "The Governor in Goa had only one claim of 21 MLAs out of 40 elected MLAs with   as their leader. The 17 MLAs of 
  nor elected their leader. How could the Congress ever be invited to form the Government?" Jaitley wrote.
 
 Jaitley cited precedents of when a coalition was invited to form the government over the single largest party due to bench strength. 
 
 Faced with a formal claim from one side that had the support of 21 MLAs, the governor 
  of 17 MLAs, Jaitley stated.
 
 "The BJP managed to form an alliance and presented to the Governor 21 out of 40 MLAs. They appeared before the Governor in person and submitted a letter of support. The Congress did not even submit a claim to the Governor," Jailtey said succinctly.
 
 
 
 
 Hours earlier, the   too echoed a similar sentiment while 
  challenging the Goa Governor's invitation to the BJP to form the government.
 
 "You (Congress) haven't demonstrated before the Governor that numbers are in your favour," the bench led by Chief Justice JS Khehar had chided.
 
 After a 
  in the Goa state Assembly polls, the Congress and the BJP were locked in a heated battle to achieve majority and form government in the coastal state. Matters came to a head when governor Mridula Sinha extended an invitation to the Manohar Parrikar led BJP coalition to form the government despite Congress emerging as the single largest party with 17 seats.
 
 Earlier today, the Supreme Court refused to stay Parrikar's swearing in ceremony and ordered a floor test for the BJP to prove its majority in the Goa Assembly.
