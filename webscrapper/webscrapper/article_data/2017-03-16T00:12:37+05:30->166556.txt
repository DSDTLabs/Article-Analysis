Pune: A medical equipment and pharmaceutical   was   in Sangli on Wednesday for allegedly supplying medical equipment and abortion drugs to medical practitioners and others involved in the illegal sex determination and termination of pregnancy racket run by homeopath Babasaheb Khidrapure in Mhaisal.

 Police also claimed that the prime suspect in the case had dumped abortion pills and other drugs in river Krishna while being on the run.
 
 The racket of illegal sex determination and illegal termination of pregnancy came to light after the death of a pregnant woman during termination of pregnancy in Sangli village, located 17 km from Miraj. Following this, Sangli police arrested homeopath Khidrapure (42), a resident of Mhaisal village. Subsequently, police also arrested medical practitioners from Kagwad village and Bijapur in Karnataka. Police later arrested a person who supplied abortion drugs to Khidrapure, a nurse and a helper of the homeopath along with four agents involved in the racket.
 
 Deputy superintendent of police (Miraj division) Dheeraj Patil told TOI that police arrested the drug and medical   Bharat Gatagat, a resident of Kolhapur, from Sangli. “He is one of the prominent drug and medical equipment suppliers and distributors in Sangli district. He supplied drugs and medical equipment to Khidrapure, the prime suspect in the case,” he said.
 
 Patil said that Khidrapure, who was on the run after a case was registered against him, had allegedly dumped pharmaceutical drugs in river Krishna. “This has been confirmed by Khidrapure himself and a team will soon try to retrieve these drugs from the river,” Patil said.
 
 Meanwhile, police have seized the motorcycle of another suspect Praveen Jamdade, whose wife Swatee died when Khidrapure operated on her on March 1.
