PUNE: With the state yet to make amendments to the Maharashtra   Revenue Code 1966, the proposed land   project is likely to be delayed.

 The rules were to be amended in the current legislative   but will now be taken up only in the   session of the assembly, stated government sources.
 
 The proposal has been pending for more than a year. The state was supposed to implement the pilot of land title registration project, as proposed by the Niti Aayog's land titling task force to minimize property disputes, stated officials.
 
 “The amendment has been pending. Once it is done we can implement it, which will enable people to have a clear understanding of the property they are purchasing with details of the past history all at one place,” stated settlement commissioner S Chockalingam.
 
 Currently, there is no system to record property titles by a public authority and purchasers are at the mercy of lawyers who have to conduct a search report and establish the title. This will change with amendments, stated officials.
 
 Chockalingam, who has readied the paper, said with the establishment of land title, records will be maintained that will serve as conclusive record of titles bridging the gap between those entering into an agreement as the titling system will protect persons from any kind of malpractices in land deals.
 
 He explained that the buyer will have a clear understanding of the title before purchase and the government will then hand over the title certificate in the demat form. He said the proposal assessed all the best practices from across the world.
