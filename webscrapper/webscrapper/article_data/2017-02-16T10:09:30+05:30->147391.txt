CHENNAI: A day after celebrations following V K Sasikala’s conviction, there was negligible action at the residence of chief minister O   on Wednesday.

 Workers who came in droves on Tuesday after the verdict were absent. The camp discussed the appointment of T T V Dinakaran as deputy general secretary of the party and the supposed disappointment within the Sasikala faction. There were reports that senior leaders of the Sasikala camp contacted those in the   think-tank to discuss the appointment which made Dinakaran the de-facto leader of the party.
 
 “The appointment and expulsions made by Sasikala are not valid and we will take up the matter legally,” former AIADMK legal wing chief Manoj Pandian told TOI.
 
 The appointments of Dinakaran and Venkatesh go against the wishes of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, said Pandian. “Amma had expelled three of them and only readmitted Sasikala under the condition that she would not meddle with politics. But her actions are against Amma’s wishes and the party workers will not accept this,” said Pandian.
 
 The party’s former presidium chairman E Madhusudanan had sent a petition to the Election Commission of India seeking the election of Sasikala as illegal as per the party bylaws. “Her appointment as general secretary has been challenged by us and we are awaiting the EC order. After that all her actions on appointments and expulsions will be declared null and void,” he said.
 
 Deliberations asides, the OPS camp got support from Kollywood with actor Gautami calling on Panneerselvam and offering her support. “We expected some MLAs to join our group. But the conditions for them leave the Koovathur camp is not conducive though many claim they are free to move about. Only if all the MLAs are released, our camp will see increase in number of MLAs,” said a member of the OPS camp.
