JAIPUR: Jaipur police said that there are many gangs akin to   that lure people online and blackmail them.

 Officials said that a 29-year-old woman was recently arrested by Sanganer police station for extorting money from a cab driver. “The gang members would ask for a lift at busy places. Once inside the car, they would ask for money or threaten to shout for help,” said an official.
 
 In February this year, the   police had arrested a 24-year-old woman who went missing after she got bail. She had extorted money from people in Jawahar Nagar, Jawahar Circle, Vaishali Nagar etc.
 
 In another incident in August 2017, the   police station had arrested a 19-year-old girl for   a 47-year-old man on the pretext of implicating him in a rape case. The police recovered Rs 27 lakh from the girl which was taken from the businessman with an undertaking that she won't lodge any rape case against him.
 
 “The cases like that of Priya Seth are neither new nor suprising, the only shocking element is that she went a step ahead and murdered her target. In most of these cases, the victims shy away from filing an FIR as it may bring infamy to them,” said an official, adding that Seth had been blackmailing people since 2012.
