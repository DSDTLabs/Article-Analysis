JAMMU/NEW DELHI: A day after it forced two of its representatives in J&K coalition to quit over the   rape and murder case, the   leadership asked the state government to withdraw its directive not to stop tribals from settling in   region.

 “The directive (of tribal affairs department) must be withdrawn,” BJP general secretary   said.
 
 Madhav was referring to CM Mehbooba Mufti’s order forbidding district administration and police from evicting tribals settled on forest land, a measure that triggered fears authoritie are trying to change the demographic mix in Hindu-dominated areas.
 
 The fear was aggravated afterRohingya refugees arrived at a privately-run settlement camps. On the Rohingyas’ presence, Madhav said the party has taken up the matter with the ministry of home affairs.
 
 Following the ouster of two BJP ministers in the J&K government, Madhav’s remarks appeared to be aimed at assuaging, as a BJP source put it, the “Hindu hurt.”
