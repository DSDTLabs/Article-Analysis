A KVarious Productions' latest offering Under The   is a rendition of  's classic Srikanto. Directed by Akash Khurana, Under The Gypsy Moon will have its opening shows at St. Andrews on September 30 and October 1. This is sixth of seven plays to be staged under the  's Aadyam b[anner this year. Sarat Chandra's original is considered the first modern Indian novel, which set the precedent for socially conscious writing in modern Indian literature. It is also considered the writer's masterpiece.

 The protagonist is a nomad who believes that every new experience enriches him. He does not want to be bound by relationships. He represents that part of every man which is in search of the true meaning of life. In this journey , he en counters two diametrically opposite women who both believe that he is their saviour.
 
 Khurana who has also adapted the novel for stage says: “There's always been this affinity to Bengali literature and sensibility. And I had never worked in that space before. Sarat Chandra's work is marvellous in its complexity and simple in its exposition.“
 
 Srikanta's encounters and experiences with various women give him renewed perspectives on matters he considered close to him.
 
 The play graphs these experiences while also commenting on social setups by making Srikanto as much a protagonist as he is a spectator.
 
 Aadyam's artistic director Divya Bhatia says: “Under the Gypsy Moon is remarkable. While it is flush with music and charm, it retains a curious, wonderful 'everyman, everyday' quality to it. It's rare to see something like this on the Mumbai stage.“ Starring Arghya Lahiri, Omkar Kulkarni, Shivraj Waichal, Aastha Arora, and Radhika Chopra,the play is a penetrating analysis, tackling issues of gender, religion and morality that resonate even today .
 
 Enjoy the show.
