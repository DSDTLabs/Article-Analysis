CHENNAI: The assembly on Monday witnessed an interesting duel between the opposition and the ruling benches over the operation of   outlets. While a   MLA offered to get his cadres to manage Tasmac bars legally, citing illegal bars in operation across the state and resulting in revenue loss, the ruling party questioned the stand of DMK over its avowed total prohibition policy.

 Participating in the budget debate, Thirumaiyam DMK MLA S Regupathi linked the government’s failure to successfully auction Tasmac shops across the state with the dwindling tax revenue of state.
 
 “Each month the government can earn not less than Rs 26 crore from the bars alone, but it is losing that revenue and most bars are being managed illegally by ruling partymen. There are more than 100 bars in Pudukottai district alone which are working illegally,” accused Regupathi. “We will ask our partymen to manage the bars after taking over through government auction,” he offered. 
 
 Immediately electricity, prohibition and excise minister P Thangamani retorted, “The MLA says his partymen will take the bars in auction and if that is true, what has happened to DMK’s policy of total prohibition.”
 
 He denied that the government is losing revenue by not auctioning bars. “Across the state we have auctioned bars, but in some places we did not get the right price. The member should furnish details on illegal bars and action will be taken,” assured Thangamani.
