  : The road and rail blockade of Indigenous People's Front of Twipra (IPFT) for the last five days has no signs of ending as the Centre and the state are yet to take any initiative to start dialogue. 

 "Until we get any assurance or an initiative for a discussion on our demand, the blockade will continue. In the last five days, nobody took any initiative to call off our movement," alleged an angry demonstrator on Friday. He added that two roads are still open to reach Agartala. 
 
 BJP's tribal wing chief of the state,  , on Friday made it clear that the party never supports the demand of separate 'Twipraland' and that the saffron party is convinced that the division of the state is not necessary for the development of tribals. 
 
 He alleged that the IPFT blockade was supported, financed and sponsored by   to create friction among tribals and non-tribals to spoil  's initiative for a united fight against the   in the coming assembly elections. 
 
 The state government on Friday once again urged the IPFT leadership to call off the blockade keeping in mind the sufferings of people.
