BENGALURU: “We are the only people who still call India as Bharat, but we are a forgotten diaspora,“ said Jean. Regis Ramsamy-Nadarassin from   in the middle of the  .
Well, Nadarassin is now in Bengaluru on a mission. He and his 13 fellow islanders are seeking India's help in relear ning Tamil language, which they had disengaged with about a few generations ago. Nadarassin is a Girmitiya, a descendant of indentured labourers who were taken from Tamil Nadu-Puducherry in India to Reunion Island, a French region in the Indian Ocean, located east of Madagascar. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas here, journalist - cum-historian Nadarassin said, “We have retained the Indian masala in the preparation of food and continued with cultural and religious rituals, but we have lost our language, our extended family in India and our links with the country .“
 
 The 2,512 sq km Reunion Island has a population of over 8 lakh, of which 30% are Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs).The successive generations have forgotten Tamil (pronounced Tamoul in the island) language and have picked up Creole, the official language of the island, along with French.
 
 Though some Tamil words are still mixed with Creole, the youngsters are completely out of touch with Tamil.
 
 “We are using the services of temple priests to learn Tamil. Tamil is being taught in the university too,“ said Latchimy Antoinette Canaguy, a member of the Reunion Island delegation.
 
 MEA officials maintained that it will be financially unviable to send teachers to the island to teach a handful of students. Online learning is a better option, said a source.
 
 The delegation, however, feels that India should reach out to the Indian diaspora in the island in a more effective manner. The delegation has also been demanding   (OCI) card for the Indian diaspora.
