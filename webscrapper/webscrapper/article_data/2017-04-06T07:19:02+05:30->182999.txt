IMPHAL:   chief minister   on Wednesday said he is going to meet  , his   counterpart, to strengthen ties with the neighbouring state. 

 Owing to political differences, which includes integration of Naga areas of the northeast under one single geographical and administrative entity and Manipur's firm stance to safeguard its territorial integrity, the two neighbouring states have a protracted estranged relation. Biren will be the first chief minister of the state to go to Nagaland and meet the chief minster to improve ties between the two states.
 
 A 10-member team of   (MCS), Kohima, which called on Biren at his office here on Wednesday, invited him to visit Nagaland to foster peace and brotherhood among the people of the two neighbouring states.
 
 "Accepting the invitation, Biren expressed his willingness to visit Nagaland by road and meet Shurhozelie as soon as possible," said a statement issued by the Manipur information and public relations department. Biren also promised to extend all possible assistance to Manipuris settled in Nagaland, the statement said. MCS is a body of Manipuris settled in Nagaland.
 
 Things have now changed to a broader spectrum to improve ties between the two neighbouring states, thanks to the inclusion of Naga People's Front (NPF) in the newly installed BJP-led coalition government in Manipur.
