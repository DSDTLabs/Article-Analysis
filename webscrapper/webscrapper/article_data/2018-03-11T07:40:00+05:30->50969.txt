LUCKNOW: Very soon, parents of schoolchildren in the city will be able to track the drivers ferrying their young ones to their school and even see and post feedback on them.

 The road   wing of transport department and district administration have decided to launch an app named ‘Bharosa’ in the city. The app will have a database of all drivers and cleaners of school vans, buses and private taxis.
 
 
 The app will help keep a tab on drivers and cleaners, and will assist police in nabbing the miscreants swiftly in case of crimes like kidnapping and molestation of children. It will be the first mechanism ever for parents to give feedback about drivers ferrying their children to school.
 
 Lucknow DM Kaushal Raj Sharma said that the app has already been designed and a tender will be floated soon for its operation and maintenance on a large scale. The app has been developed by Lucknow-based entrepreneur Alok Singh. A similar app designed by Singh is already being successfully run in   district.
 
 Bulandshahr DM   told TOI over phone that the app’s database has details of 300 drivers in the district and state minister of transport has asked that the app should be replicated across the state.
 
 Principal secretary, transport,   said that steps are afoot to launch the app in all districts of the state.
 
 The school principals will give a list of drivers and their details to concerned police station which will get verification done. The details of each verified driver and his vehicle will be entered in the database of the app.
 
 A proper system will be designed for taking time-bound action on complaints and feedback from parents and school authorities.
