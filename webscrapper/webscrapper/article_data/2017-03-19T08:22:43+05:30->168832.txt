LUCKNOW: Soon after BJP announced Lucknow Mayor Dinesh Sharma’s name as the new deputy CM of UP, discussions on who would replace him till time municipal elections are held started doing rounds. 

 As a rule, whenever the mayor’s post gets vacant, elections are conducted within six months. Since municipal elections in UP are due in May, any new mayor appointed now would serve for only about three months. 
 
 As per the Nagar Nigam Act 1959, section 14 1 (A), whenever a mayor post gets vacant or he has to resign from the post, the state government has the authority to appoint an administrator in his position to act on his behalf. “It could be the existent DM,   or even municipal commissioner of the city,” said an   official. In most cases, the existing municipal commissioners serves as acting mayors. 
 
 A senior official in urban planning department said such instances have already occurred in Moradabad and Ghaziabad when after a mayor’s demise, incumbent municipal commissioners were given powers to act on mayor’s behalf till the time new mayor was elected. 
 
 Ex-Mayor  , who has served LMC for three terms between 1971 and 1992 told TOI, “Such condition has never occurred in the past when a mayor has to leave because of being given a new role. Since the post of deputy mayor was abolished long ago, in such conditions the state government can appoint any administrator to act at mayor.”
