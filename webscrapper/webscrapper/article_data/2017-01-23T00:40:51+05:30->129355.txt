NEW DELHI: Breeding of banned variety of   in Delhi needs immediate attention, said officials who seized a consignment on Saturday. The revenue department came across 25 tonnes of the predatory   or catfish at the Mangolpuri   market, which led it to multiple ponds in nearby areas where the fish was being bred on a commercial scale.

 Santosh Rai, SDM (Rohini) who led a team at Mangolpuri, told TOI, “The Centre had issued a blanket ban against the breeding, sale or purchase of African magur in 2002. This specie is not indigenous and is highly predatory in nature. It can completely destroy the ecology and eat all the other fish and organisms under water.”
 
 “We received complaints that the fish was being sold in Mangolpuri and Sultanpuri markets. On Saturday, when we visited the Mangolpuri fish market, we caught four trucks carrying 25 tonnes of the banned fish. At least three to four different people were involved in the trade. The consignment was buried in a nearby pit but on investigation we found that it was being bred in Delhi itself while some of it is even coming from Haryana,” he said.
 
 When the team visited the neighbouring Kanjhawala area, they found at least two ponds where breeding was done commercially. “In one village, there were 5-10 ponds where we believe it was done. We have asked the irrigation and flood control department to provide pumps to drain out the water from these ponds so that the fish can be buried there itself,” said an official.
 
 In its 2002 order, Centre’s fisheries department had pointed out the “exotic specie has found its way to our natural water system and has been spotted in Yamuna at Okhla and in Satluj post monsoon”.
 
 However, there are several states where large scale breeding was carried out, including Haryana, Karnataka,   and Tamil Nadu. Sources said this species is commercially more profitable than the Indian magur as it grows at a much faster rate.
