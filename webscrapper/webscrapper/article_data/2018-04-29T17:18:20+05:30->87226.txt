For  , acting as a woman for the film   has been a learning experience in more ways than one. It's only now that he realises how tough it is to be a woman, whether it be about the clothes one wears or the accessories.

  The actor pierced his ears to look and feel the part, and also wore women's attire and make up for the role. "My wife is my costume designer for the film, and she had her sister has been with me throughout, dressing me up," he says.
 
 So did he enjoy wearing a sari? The actor is in two minds about that. "I have no idea how women go around in a sari in the heat, let alone in a hot wedding hall," he says. "I can't even move properly." Jayasurya plays a transwoman in the film, directed by Ranjith Sankar.
