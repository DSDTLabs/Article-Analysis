SURAT: The postmortem examination on 11-year-old girl found murdered under Pandesara police stations limits here on Friday has noticed 86 injuries on her body. Police believe she was brutally tortured by her assailant for over eight days before being murdered. There were severe injuries in her private parts too. The girl is yet to be identified. No arrest has been made in the case so far.

 Police have announced Rs 20,000 reward for anyone providing information about the identity of the girl. They have circulated a poster on social media and in print in the area along with the photo of the deceased. 
 
 The postmortem examination revealed that the injuries were not fresh. The injury caused in her private parts was severe and had been inflicted a few days ago, police said. “It seems a stick like object had been inserted in her private parts. Like other injuries, the wound in her private parts is of a few days old. The girl was subjected to severe torture before being killed,” police said. 
 
 There are multiple injuries from being thrashed with a stick or some blunt objects all over the girl’s body, about which the doctors mentioned in the postmortem report. The girl was strangled to death by an unidentified person, who also sexually abused her. Police have registered a case of rape and also booked the unidentified accused under The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. 
 
 “Attempts are being made to establish the identity of the girl. She was tortured for eight to 10 days before being killed. She must have been confined to some place and tortured by the assailant,” deputy commissioner of police, zone II, Vidhi Chaudhary said.
 
 The assailant left the body of the girl at an isolated spot on a stretch that connects the road to the highway where there is no closed circuit television coverage.
