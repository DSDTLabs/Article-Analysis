Panaji: The process of moving centuries-old artefacts from the Goa State Museum building in Patto, Panaji, to Adil Shah Palace, is complete. Museum officials are now charting out the display plan, following which the museum will reopen to public. Museum officials have to now prepare a storyline that will highlight the historic relevance of the displayed items in a narrative. “Composing and executing the storyline will take at least two months. We still have to figure out whether we can accommodate full galleries or display select artefacts,” a museum official told TOI.
