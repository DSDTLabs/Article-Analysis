BENGALURU: The Indian contingent in   for the Commonwealth Games 2018 could be in for some close scrutiny from the   (ASADA) officials after reported findings on Friday of needles and syringes from some rooms occupied by the Indian contingent. 

 
 
 
 According to sources, the syringes were found by the local officials, though it was not immediately clear whether they were found during surprise checks or by the housekeeping staff.
 
 “The syringes were found from some team members’ rooms. This could mean that the Indian athletes across disciplines could be asked to undergo surprise targeted dope tests even in the run-up to the Games during the next few days,” sources told TOI.
 
 Sources in the   (IOA) said they were not surprised by the development and recalled similar episodes during the Rio Olympics and at the last   in Glasgow. “At the 2014 Games, India even got an official warning from the   ( ) for inappropriate disposal of needles by the athletes. Two years later at the Rio Olympics, syringes were again found from the players’ rooms,” they said.
 
 “During the pre-departure briefing for Gold Coast, we had told all the athletes very clearly about the dos and don’ts relating to anti-doping rule violations. If there is a need for a genuine use of a syringe, they have to take permission, otherwise they will be in trouble,” they added.
 
 Starting from the Glasgow Games, the CGF has enforced a ‘needle free’ policy, except for those who need to use needles for treatment. The CGF is planning to implement the rules more strictly in Gold Coast.
 
 The anti-doping programme at the Games to be held from April 4 to 15 is run by the CGF with assistance from the ASADA. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is sending a three-member team of observers to monitor the anti-doping programme.
