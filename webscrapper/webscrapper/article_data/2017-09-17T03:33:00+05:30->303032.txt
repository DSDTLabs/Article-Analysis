Panaji: Heaps of bottles, plastic and litter of various types were found in the Mandovi river and its banks after an inspection at the yachts club area at   on Friday.

 It was supposed to be a joint inspection of town and country planning (TCP) department and panchayat members, but TCP officials did not turn up, sources said.
 
 The villagers had been complaining about the violation of coastal regulation zone (CRZ) 2011 notification for some time, and TCP had assured them of inspecting the area. The panchayat members led by sarpanch Snehal Harmalkar and some islanders found garbage being burnt and mangroves felled in the area between Divar and Chorao. 
 
 The issue is likely to figure at the gram sabha of Navelim-Goltim panchayat (Divar) on Sunday.
