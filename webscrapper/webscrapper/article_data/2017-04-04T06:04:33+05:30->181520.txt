AHMEDABAD: The special SIT court hearing the 2002   case on Monday asked the prosecution to seek a clarification from investigating officer  , about his evasive replies on questions pertaining to other witnesses.

 In response to an application filed by Chetan Shukla, an advocate for the advocate, designated judge P B Desai said Shukla’s explanation during his cross-examination about the testimonies of three cops – then PI K K Mysorewala, then   M K Tandon and then DCP P B Gondia was evasive and not clear. The prosecutors have been asked to seek a clarification in this regard and to make it clear whether the IPS officer will be able to provide a specific answer on the subject.
 
 The court termed the IPS officer’s vague reply as “unfortunate”. After finding Shukla’s reply on the statements of three cops during his cross-examination evasive, the court said that in his response to a query, the cop has tried to justify the evasion on the ground that the probe was under way during that period.
 
 The court further commented that the trial is nearly complete and there is no further investigation pending at present. “In such circumstances, I am of the opinion that the accused are within their rights to seek such a clarification… In my opinion, therefore, the state cannot evade and continue to evade providing clarity to the trial proceedings,” the court said, while asking the prosecution to get a specific reply from the officer about the three cops’ statements.
 
 Further hearing shall be on Friday, when the court will likely hear former minister and accused Maya Kodnani’s plea to summon BJP president   and 13 others, to establish her alibi.
 
 The special court is conducting a trial against 84 persons, for the killing of 11 Muslims in the post-Godhra violence.
