PANAJI:   Committee (GPCC) on Thursday said the possibility of a post-poll alliance with the   was unlikely if the latter’s stance on the   (MoI) and other issues remained unchanged.

 “The MGP has to change its priorities. It has to give up contentious issues like MoI. Only then, we can (consider an alliance with MGP),” said AICC general secretary  , before quickly adding, “But we don’t need them because we will have a good majority.”
 
 The regional party had allied with the Congress in the 2007 state assembly election, during which it had won two seats. The MGP and the Congress have a long, often rocky, political history in Goa, but pundits have toyed with the possibility of the two parties patching up to form the next government in the event of the Congress rustling up sufficient numbers in the February 4 assembly election.
 
 Singh, however, refused to confirm that the party had adopted a softer stance against the MGP and said that corruption allegations against the regional party’s leaders would be probed.
