JAIPUR: Strawberry farming is no longer meant only for the hills. The mandarin orange growing belt in   is now successfully multi-cropping, not with dhania, wheat and soya, but strawberries, which was unthinkable, so far, in arid Rajasthan. After the crop was introduced to farmers a season ago, around 2.5 hectares of agricultural land is under strawberry cultivation in Jhalawar.

 “It’s commonly understood that strawberries do well only in cold weather. It took three years of research and evaluation of 16 varieties of strawberries for their adaptability. They were tested in four climatic conditions—natural, polyhouse, shading net and controlled conditions. But only one among them, the famous ‘Winter Dawn’ variety from Mahabaleshwar in Pune, took to the weather in Jhalawar,” said Dr I B Maurya, professor, College of Horticulture & Forestry, Jhalawar. The variety was grown with mulch and watered using drip irrigation and can be grown in open fields instead of polyhouses, says Dr Maurya. While Jhalawar is ideal to cultivate this variety, this can be grown in other districts too, he said.
 
 The new crop has spread cheer among the farmers of the region who look at it as a 60-day cash crop. “The sole crop in the region is mandarin and farmers earn Rs 2.5 to 3 lakh per hectare. But with strawberry as a multi-crop option, farmers can easily earn an additional Rs 5-6 lakh in a lesser time span. One hectare ideally needs 50,000 plants, but if grown in between mandarin crops, one needs only 25,000 plants. This will fetch them 8-10 tonnes of strawberry which now has a going price of Rs 15,000 per tonne,” said Maurya. The fruit tastes very good and is on par with the ones from Mahabaleshwar, he said. 
 
 With growing popularity of strawberry cultivation, there’s growing need for packing material which is, so far, being brought from Pune.
