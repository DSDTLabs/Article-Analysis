Later, the bus travels to Karanakonam and by 2.30pm, the feeder service to Metro stations resumes. After four circular services, the bus travels to Thuravoor and returns.
 
 "We collect at least Rs 4,000 or below because of services to other parts of the district and Thuravoor. Otherwise, we will not get even this amount. Collection on the second day nosedived below Rs 3,000. The passenger footfall to feeder service is very poor. We are planning to explore new routes for the service to increase our collection.
