NEW DELHI: India’s largest steel producing firm,   is likely to return back on claiming profit in the fourth quarter ending March 2018, along with better price realisation.

 As per a poll conducted by Reuters, including 10 analysts there were estimations that the steelmaking firm will announce a consolidated profit of Rs 2,552 crore in the fourth quarter of 2018, as compared to a loss of Rs 1,168 crore a year earlier.
 
 The Indian-multinational company is set to announce its quarterly results on May 16, today.
 
 As per the polls, the company’s consolidated revenue will be Rs 34,869 crore as against Rs 33,896 crore last year.
 
 Tata Steel will be helped by an increase in the steel prices and also a change in the rate of raw materials, including the iron ore and coking coal. Such market conditions have compensated for tough conditions the company faced in terms of facilities. 
 
 Tata Steel’s production in India for the quarter was highly affected by the breakdown in the facility of Kalinganagar’s blast furnace. As a result of which the domestic sales went down by 6.23 percent to 3.01 million tons and the production decreased by 4.06 percent at 3.07 million tons.
 
 The domestic market will be looking forward for the company’s outlook in the FY, considering its participation in the insolvency process. It has been already announced that the preferred resolution bidder in the case of Bhushan Steel, Tata Steel is up against a late bid by Liberty House in the auction of Bhushan Power & Steel.
 
 The company had announced that it has started to look for buyers for five of its non-core assets in its European unit. Tata steel could provide guidance on the suggested merger of its European wing with Thyssenkrupp. But as of now, the merger has been delayed.
 
 
 The performance in the European unit was pretty same, where sales went down to 2.48 million tons, from 2.85 million tons in the previous earlier. Production was flat at 2.62 million tons.
