PANAJI: There was a palpable sense dismay among students of the   following the announcement of re-examination for Class XII economics and Class X mathematics papers. CBSE schools in the state are considering writing to the board seeking exemption from the   for the Class X mathematics paper.

 Schools feel it would be unnecessary stress for students to go through a re-examination as the subject is not an easy one.
 
 The re-examination has been called following suspicions of leakage of the papers. There is doubt that leakage could have occurred in different states, and not just one.
 
 The CBSE circular on Wednesday said that dates and other details for the re-examination would be posted on its website. While the Maths paper was held on Wednesday, the economic paper was held on Monday. 
 
 One teacher, who was observer for the Class X mathematics paper, said, “Soon after the paper began, we were asked to click a picture of the   along with its tag and send it across to board officials. So it appears the suspicion crept in early on Wednesday about a possible leakage.”
 
 Students, who answered the paper, came out very happy and overwhelmingly said that the mathematics paper had been very satisfactory and that they expected to score well. But the same students were left upset when the news of a re-examination came through.
 
 “Mathematics is one subject all students find tough. But they were really happy the paper was found to be very clear and as per their expectation. Though the paper for all centres across the country and abroad is the same, we schools are considering getting together and writing to the board to exempt Goa students from a re-examination. Why should they reappear for the exam if there has been no leakage in Goa,” said a school head.
 
 Students answered the mathematics paper through around 12 centres across Goa on Wednesday morning.
