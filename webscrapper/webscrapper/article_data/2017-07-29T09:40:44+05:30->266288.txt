JAIPUR:   officials on Friday   a coaching institute in   for defacing public property and allegedly dirtying city roads. “The institute situated in   area was sealed as it was defacing public property. It has been sealed temporarily,” a JMC official said.

 Over the past few days, JMC has shown no leniency to those who are flouting norms.
 
 According to an official, there is a provision in the Rajasthan Municipality Act to slap a fine of Rs 20,000 or one month’s sentence on those who deface public property. Only JMC can lodge an FIR in the case. If the court finds the accused guilty, it can impose a fine or sentence. 
 
 Meanwhile, the authority has decided to carry out night sweeping on 56 major roads of the city. These roads have been identified from every zone where traffic frequency is high through the day. The new system will be effective from August 1.
 
 At present, JMC is carrying out night sweeping in many major markets of the   area. However, the system has failed completely as shopkeepers alleged that garbage is found littered on the roads in the morning.
 
 “There is no proper monitoring at night by the officials. We have requested to start the sweeping in the morning,” said Vardhan Singh, a shopkeeper. 
 
 JMC officials, however, claimed that cleaning roads in the night gives free movement to employees and anyone throwing garbage in the open can be easily checked.
 
 Street cleaning in the night is also done in metro cities. The practice is quite popular in foreign countries.
