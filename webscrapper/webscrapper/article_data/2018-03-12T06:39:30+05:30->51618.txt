DARJEELING: The GJM-backed Darjeeling Terai Dooars Plantation Labourers’ Union (DTDPLU) has threatened to stop plucking the first flush of tea leaves from Monday in Darjeeling gardens.

 The move comes on the eve of chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s visit to Darjeeling to attend the Hill Business Summit — an initiative to rope in investors for this region.
 
 The tea plantation workers are irked by the non-payment of the Puja bonus for 2016-17 as was earlier agreed. The 104-day statehood demand strike had ended in September, just ahead of the Durga Pujas. So the workers did not get the bonus. They were to get bonus at 19.75%.
 
 DTDPLU general secretary Bharat   said on Sunday, “Only 14 gardens have given full bonus to workers. So,we decided to stop plucking the first flush of tea leaves from Monday.”
 
 DTDPLU had stopped the dispatch of the renowned first flush Darjeeling tea leaves from March 1. However, plucking of tea leaves was allowed by the trade union.“We stopped dispatch of the produce, but not plucking,” Thakuri said He added that gardens that will give written assurance to pay the remaining bonus within a time frame would be allowed to pluck.
 
 Plucking of the first flush Darjeeling tea starts in March and continues till the first week of May. After a break of 15-20 days the second flush is harvested. Nearly 2 to 2.5 million kilograms of the Darjeeling tea leaf is produced in the first flush that is exported to European countries with the annual production reaching around 8.5 to 9 million kilograms.
 
  minister   said they will hold a meeting to discuss the issue on Monday.
