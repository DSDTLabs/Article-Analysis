 At least six speakers at the event criticized Delhi-based leaders for complete control over campaigning in Punjab and lack of truct in Punjab leaders. They said that observers from Delhi ran the party and the campaigning according to their own whims, which finally became the main reason for loss of the party, especially when party failed to project a CM face.

 Khaira in his speech was quite categorical in saying that the party needed to come out of the culture of sycophancy and there was need to promote leadership on merit. 
 
 He also said that hegemonic control by Delhi leadders on the state unit proved disastrous and now leadership should be given to Punjabis. 
 
 He also held that there was big opportunity for AAP in 2019 election as Captain Amarinder Singh led state government was not expected to perform great and SAD was continuing with leadership of Suikhbir Singh Badal. "Sukhbir's leadership suits the opposition and SAD can't revive under him as there is deep and huge sentiment against him in the   as well as in the people," he argued.
 
 Khaira also said that current position and nomenclature of convenor sounded more like a clerical post and the state unit should have a president. While all those present raised their arms in agreement after a   raised demand that Khaira be given command of the state unit, Khaira himself said that he would not dither in shouldering any responsibility but would not function like a dummy office bearer.
