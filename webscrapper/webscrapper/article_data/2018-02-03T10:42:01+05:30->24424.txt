 Pushed into a corner, some state leaders of BJP say they are not too worried over TDP’s threat. “We want the alliance to be intact. If TDP has second thoughts on this, let it be. We are not bothered,” Jammula Syam Kishore, state general secretary of BJP,told TOI. Another leader said on condition of anonymity that a section of state BJP was wary of an alliance with TDP from the beginning.
 
 “We had alerted our party’s central leadership long ago about the cunning politics of TDP, but sadly, they didn’t take enough measures to rein in our coalition partner,” rued asenior BJP leader.
