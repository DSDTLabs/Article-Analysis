PUNE: A tiffin supplier lost Rs 1.12 lakh after some crooks coaxed him into revealing details of his debit card and transferred money from his bank account via 34 online transactions on May 27. 

 The suspects duped Sunil   (41) from   on the pretext of offering him a gift voucher worth Rs 75,000. 
 
 Sharma told TOI, “I had received a call from a woman saying that my phone number was selected in a lucky draw for a gift voucher. Eventually, she lured me into transferring Rs 4,000 online from my mother’s account to the bank account provided by her.”
 
 “Later, I received another call from a man saying that my account number was not matching with the bank’s record and I needed to reveal my debit card data and also needed to share its one-time password with him. Minutes after I shared the details, the suspects transferred Rs 1.12 lakh from my account via 34 online transactions. I realized that I was duped when I got a string of messages from my bank.” 
 
 Sharma immediately went to the bank to realise that it was closed. “I withdrew Rs 23,000 immediately from an ATM before they could steal more. I could not get the card blocked because the bank’s customer care number was busy,” he said.
 
 Sharma later filed a complaint with the cyber crime cell. “The cell identified the internet protocol address of the suspects and investigations revealed that they transferred the money online to a bank account in New Delhi,” he added. 
 
 Wanowrie police senior inspector   said on Saturday, “We are in the process of collecting details of the transactions.”
