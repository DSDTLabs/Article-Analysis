HYDERABAD:  , especially in residential areas of the city, has become a nightmare. With shrinking road space and increasing vehicular traffic, the problem does not seem close to being solved anytime soon. 

 Residents of areas such as Malkajgiri, Madinaguda, Chandanagar, Kukatpally, Habsiguda, Somajiguda and Uppal point out how due to the lack of proper parking complexes, vehicles are often found parked along internal roads in the city. This leaves   congested.
 
 Locals say that parking along internal and service roads in the city has eaten into the road space in a significant manner.
 
 "Autos, trucks, two-and four-wheelers being parked on the side of lanes, leaving no space for vehicles to drive by and people to walk, has become common," said Sunitha Nair, a resident of Ramakrishna Nagar in Madinaguda.
 
 Other residents of Madinaguda and Kukatpally complain that private buses can be seen parked haphazardly on the main road and several service roads of localities causing inconvenience. Residents point out how the problem is likely to persist if the state government does not speed up construction of multi-level parking complexes.
 
 "The state government must speed up construction of parking lots in the city which is the only real solution to the parking crunch. Even as the number of vehicles entering roads continues to go up, no arrangements are being made to increase the parking space in the city," pointed out one Anil Reddy. He went on to say that parking violations have been continuing unabated even near the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ward office in Uppal.
