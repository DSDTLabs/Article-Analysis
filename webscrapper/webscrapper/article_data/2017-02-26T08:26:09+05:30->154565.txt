LUCKNOW: Research Designs and   (RDSO) will start the oscillation trial of   from Tuesday. The rake (train) has been handed over to   and, at present, preparations, like putting  , are being made. 

 The oscillatoin trial will find out how much the train oscillates while moving and the trial for emergency brake distance will find out at about how much distance the rake would stop after emergency brakes are applied. 
 
 The two trials would be done separately and would take about a fortnight. "The trials are meant to ensure smooth operation of the rake," said a source in RDSO. The trial would be conducted under different track conditions, like dry and wet track. 
 
 The trial would be conducted for both empty and loaded rakes. The rake would be loaded with cement bags to make it weigh as much as one loaded with passengers.
