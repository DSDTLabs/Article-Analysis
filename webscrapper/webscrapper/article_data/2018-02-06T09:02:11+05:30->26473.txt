NAMAKKAL: Egg exporters from   have urged Prime Minister   to bring egg under proposed Free Trade Bilateral Agreement (FTBA) with  , a major importer of Indian eggs, during his visit to the country on February 11.

 The exporters said after the raise of wholesale price of eggs in November, 2017, the exports to Oman had decreased from 3.75 crore eggs a month to 2.10 crore eggs. They said inclusion of egg in FTBA will remove import duty of 5% imposed by Oman. 
 
 “The egg export was almost nil during the three weeks when prices were high in November,” said P V  , secretary of Livestock and Agri Farmers Trade Association (LIFT). Talking to TOI, he further said due to the hike, the importers in Oman had bought the supplies from Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Ukraine and Brazil. “Since then, whenever the prices in India go up, they get supplies from alternative sources,” he added.
 
 According to the data from the central excise department, the number of eggs exported to Oman decreased by 1.65 crore a month since November. “Before November the business was worth Rs 18 crore a month and it came down to Rs 8.2 crore since then,” Senthil said. 
 
 The wholesale price of an egg in   had touched all-time high of Rs 5.16 on November 16. Following this, high demand for eggs in North India due to winter had kept the price at higher range despite decreased demand in   and Kerala due to Sabarimala season. “When the wholesale price goes up in India, it would ultimately affect the importers in Oman as they have to pay extra from their pocket,” Senthil said.
 
 Livestock and Agri Farmers Trade Association has sent a letter to Narendra Modi seeking speedy action on the issue. “We urge Narendra Modi to initiate talk with the Sulatanate of Oman to include table eggs from India in the Free Trade Bilateral Agreement during his visit to Oman,” said Senthil.
 
 “It would help egg exporters to revive their business once again,” said K Suresh, another egg exporter.
