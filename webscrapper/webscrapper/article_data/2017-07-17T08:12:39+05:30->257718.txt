CHANDIGARH: The law enacted in 2009 to save   has had a significant impact in slowing the   in  , which was at the forefront of the  , says a study published in the journal ‘Environmental Management’ in July 2016. It is the first study that has taken into account the impact of The Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act, 2009, which was notified on April 28, 2009.

 Authors Amarnath Tripathi of the Institute of Economic Growth (IEG), New Delhi; Ashok K Mishra of the Arizona State University (ASU), Tempe, US and Geetanjali Verma of KPMG, Bengaluru conducted the study ‘Impact of Preservation of Subsoil Water Act on Groundwater Depletion: The Case of Punjab, India,’ using the panel data from 1985-86 to 2011-12. Their study was divided into two periods—pre-act (before 2009) and post-act (after 2009).
 
 The authors had taken the data from 12 districts of Punjab—Patiala, Sangrur, Bathinda, Faridkot, Ferozepur, Ludhiana, Ropar, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Amritsar and Gurdaspur—into consideration for their study “because data for the study period is consistently available only for these districts.”
 
 The key finding of the study mentions that the average annual rate of the decline of groundwater was 0.7 metre from 2008-09 to 2012-13 in Punjab, which is less than the average annual dip in the groundwater by 0.9 metre from 2000-01 to 2008-09. Thus the average annual decline in groundwater was reduced by 0.2 metres (20 cm). The authors stated that the study established the hypothesis that Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act of 2009 has had a positive impact on groundwater levels.
 
 Further, the act, which stipulated dates for sowing of nursery for paddy from May 10 and transplanting of the saplings after June 15, also showed that the area under the crop went up in Punjab, rather than going down, which the authors stated, “the significant change in paddy acreage could not have been achieved if the farmers had not accepted the 2009 act.” The study also pointed that the four-year average of paddy acreage increased from about 2.652 million hectares (26.52 lakh hectares) in the 2004-05 to 2008-09 period to 2.835 million hectares (28.35 lakh hectares) in the 2010-11 to 2013-14 period. “It shows a significant jump in the cultivated area under paddy despite the water act of 2009,” mention the authors.
 
 Another finding of the study is that a higher share of tubewells and an increase in population density (PD) have significantly reduced the groundwater. “On the other hand, rainfall and the share of surface water used for irrigation have had an augmenting effect on the groundwater table,” the authors point out.
