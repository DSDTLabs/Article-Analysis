INDORE: In her address to the house,   claimed that her tenure has been fruitful as far as revenue collection is concerned. But the opposition lashed out at the ruling party saying that they had increased the burden on common people.

 “The total revenue for 2014-15 was Rs 130 crore. In 2015-16 it was Rs 153 crore. This financial year, we had collected Rs 185 crore till March 2,” Gaud said.
 
 However,   alleged that the civic body had been taking action only against the common people and not against  .
 
 “There has been no action taken against any big industrialist. Why has action not been taken against big schools? Why have big marriage gardens not been sealed? There are government offices that have not paid taxes. Why are you not acting against them?” asked  , congress corporator.
 
 Dastak alleged that while action is taken against common people immediately, the civic body only sends notices to big defaulters and does not take action.
 
 While Dastak was levying allegations against the ruling party, Suraj Kero, member mayor in council, interrupted. “It seems that the opposition does not know the facts. We have been actively taking action against all tax defaulters irrespective of their background,” Kero said.
 
 The opposition also alleged that the poor have been burdened with taxes through additional charges levied on garbage collection facilities. “We need to reduce the tax burden on the poor. They are paying taxes twice for the same thing,” said Fozia Sheikh Alim, leader of opposition, IMC.
 
 The mayor and leaders of ruling party said that they had not increased any tax. “A charge of Rs 2 is collected under the new garbage collection system. This is in accordance with the act and is not a new tax,” Kero said.
