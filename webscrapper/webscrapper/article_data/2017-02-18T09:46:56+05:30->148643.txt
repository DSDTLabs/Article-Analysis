CHENNAI: All eyes are on  , who will be in an   when the 
  is taken up on Saturday .

 In any  , especially when the numbers are too close to call, the speaker of the House is the ultimate authority. If he/she decides to go by the rule book the party or faction with the majority will win, but if he or she decides to tweak the rule book and favour a particular faction, it could lead to pandemonium, resulting in the governor imposing President's rule.
 
 Dhanapal has been the opposition target for nearly five years when there were several instances of his expunging normal remarks made by opposition members. But on Saturday he has to act against a faction of his own party. “In the last assembly session, Dhanapal supported AIADMK members when they raised the name of Sasikala, but at the same time pacified DMK members by suggesting they too can raise the names of their leaders. Thus we could not read his mind,“ said a senior rebel leader.
 
 The first issue Dhanapal may have to tackle soon after the assembly convenes is the demand for debate on the motion. “However, the main issue for the speaker will be to decide on the type of voting to be adopted,“ said an assembly secretariat official.
 
 The rebel group has demanded a secret ballot and DMK has also supported this. But the Sasikala faction is against it. “All eyes are on Dhanapal on his ruling for the type of voting,“ said the official.
 
 “We have several instances of the assembly speaker being partial; the classic example in Tamil Nadu is the 1988 confidence vote when speaker P H Pandian manipulated numbers to favour the   faction.Similar instances have taken place in the Uttar Pradesh assembly as well as in other assemblies where the trust vote was held,“ said a veteran DMK parliamentarian.
