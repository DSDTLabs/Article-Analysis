SAMASTIPUR: CPI-ML (Liberation) general secretary   on Thursday said the Mahagathbandhan government in Bihar had failed to meet the expectations of people. Bhattacharya, who was here to garner support for his party’s February 19 rally, also dubbed   at the Centre “pro-capitalist”.

 Bhattacharya said the people of Bihar did not vote for a government plagued with corruption and cited the Intermediate topper scam and   question paper leak scam to buttress his point. He said poor implementation of the government projects and sorry state of affairs in education, healthcare and agriculture sectors clearly indicated that the state government has failed to discharge its responsibilities towards the people. “Social justice was a false slogan of CM   and others at the helm of affairs in Bihar,” Bhattacharya said. 
 
 He came down heavily on central government for  , saying the decision affected masses adversely while the big capitalists gained from it.
