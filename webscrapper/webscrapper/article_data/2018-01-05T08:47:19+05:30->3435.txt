CHENNAI: A panic-stricken couple and their 16-month-old daughter rushed to an eye hospital in the city on Wednesday after blood started to drip from the child’s swollen eyes.

 Most parents are unlikely to welcome a doctor diagnosing their child with conjunctivitis — colloquially referred to as ‘Madras Eye’ — but this pair welcomed the ophthalmologist’s conclusion with relief. Little wonder, since neither of them had heard of, let alone witnessed, such a severe case of the viral  .
 
 “We’re seeing many patients with a severe form of highly infectious acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis,” said Dr S Soundari of Dr Agarwal’s Eye Hospitals. “Some of them come only after the condition worsens, vision is disrupted or there is bleeding from the eyes,” she said.
 
 Madipakkam homemakerR Gayathri, 26, and her husband said they were terrified for their daughter when they saw blood fall from the little girl’s eyes.
 
 “We saw the redness in her eyes and took her to a paediatrician,” Gayathri said. “He gave her some eye drops but then we saw blood and panicked. We later discovered that our daughter needed stronger medication.”
 
 The doctor has put both the mother and child on antibiotics. A virus usually causes conjunctivitis — inflammation of the conjunctiva, a membrane that covers the front of the eye. Acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis involves the discharge of blood by vessels of the conjunctiva. Doctors may prescribe   or steroids to treat secondary infections and ease symptoms.
 
 Self-medication or drugs doled out by a local pharmacist can prolong symptoms and make them worse, doctors warned. Closed environments such as offices and schools may cause rapid spread of the infection and cause an epidemic outbreak. 
 
 “The health department should put out an urgent advisory,” said Dr Mohan Rajan of Rajan Eye Care. “We have had patients with secondary infections that require high spectrum antibiotics. Some recover only after a month.”
