AMRITSAR: Border Security Force (BSF) on Tuesday seized two Pakistani fishing boats that drifted on this side of the border. Three days ago,   had seized another boat from Pakistan.

 BSF deputy inspector general (Amritsar sector) J S Oberoi said water level in Ravi river had gone up on Monday night following rains and it was possible that the boats drifted along the flow of water. The boats were seized near  , he added.
 
 He said   had approached the BSF to take back their boats. “We have asked them to give dimensions and identifications,” DIG Obersoi said, adding that three days ago they had seized another boat that had also sailed into the Indian territory through Ravi. The river enters into India near Tota Bulge.
 
 While ruling out any deliberate attempt by Pakistan Rangers to send boats to check BSF’s alertness, the DIG said, “There is nothing like that. We have seen these coming since our posts are on both banks of the river. We can observe a boat before it enters into India.”
 
 He said BSF had recovered nothing objectionable except fishermen’s tools. In October 2016, a Pakistani boat was found under suspicious circumstances near Tota Bulge. However, then the Pakistan Rangers had refused to take back the boat. BSF had then seized a Pakistani flag and a Multan-made candy and it was rumoured that it was a deliberate attempt to send the boat to check alertness of BSF.
