It is probably one of the most popular reality shows to have hit   television. Especially when it was introduced back in 2010, Pyaate Hudgir Halli Life (PHHL) went on to capture popular imagination with its unique format which involved taking a large group of thorough city-bred girls and putting them up in a rural setting to fend for themselves sans the luxuries of life. Having completed three successful seasons, the show will soon be back with its fourth edition, albeit after a gap of four years. The last time Pyaate Hudgir... aired was in 2014. 
Why such a huge break? “The GEC format then was undergoing a change. We too decided to experiment with new programmes and introduced comedy and dance shows. Now, audiences have given us feedback that they’d like to see Pyaate Hudgir... again and it perfectly synced with the channels desire to bring back a revamped version,” says a source from the channel. 
 And this time around, the show will be shot in Gorur near Hassan. 
 This time, the makers have decided to introduce non-resident Kannadigas on the show. “We are getting a lot of enquirers from girls in Dubai, Mumbai, Delhi and even Kolkata. It will be interesting to watch how they cope, not just in rustic surrounding but also in a place that is far removed from their hometowns,” concurs the source. 
 
 Psst!
 Having hosted it for three seasons, the last one was hosted by actor  . “I was in the Bigg Boss house then. But I’m looking forward to hosting this season which will go on air in the last week of March,” says host  .
