HYDERABAD: Close to 2,000 techies, retrenched IT professionals and members of the Forum of IT Professionals (ForIT) gathered at  , on Friday evening, to participate in a demonstration organised to create awareness about employee rights, job security and to demand implementation of labour laws in the lo calI Tindustry.

 
 The event was also held to commemorate the 132nd anniversary of the May 4 ‘labour demonstration for eight-hour work days’ held in Chicago, in 1886. The demonstrators rued how despite working for almost 12 hours, on an average every day,they are not paid any ‘overtime’ by the IT companies.
 
 “In any other profession, one is paid for working more than the regular hours .IT companies, however, do not have any overtime pay rules. Also, in an environment where employment opportunities are continually shrinking, job security has become even more important. Many of the retrenched techies in the city have not managed to find jobs elsewhere and we are currently in talks with courts regarding the   case,” said   has, a member of ForIT, which is currently assisting retrenched employees of   (  India) with their ongoing cases. The firm allegedly laid off over 250 employees last year.
 
 To further their cause, the ForIT,on May 26 will hold a state convention for IT professionals in Hyderabad, during which a union for IT employees will be launched. They are expected to highlight the “illegal” layoffs by tech giants such as Verizon, Cognizant and   during the meet.
 
 “While more than a lakh IT employees were laid off across the country last year, in Hyderabad alone, over 30,000 were wrongfully terminated. It is the mid-level and senior-level jobs that are mostly in jeopardy. There will be a high number of layoffs post this appraisal season as well,” said a techie working with an MNC.
