Panaji: Health minister Vishwajit Rane on Friday said that the foundation stone for the long-pending super specialty block at the Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim will be laid by Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar in November this year.

 The health minister also announced plans to revive the   registry at GMC. He was speaking at the ‘World Heart Day’ celebrations held at Sanskruti Bhavan, Patto-Panaji on Friday evening.
 
 Rane said that the diabetes registry has been non-functional for the last five years.
 
 “I have taken keen interest in reviving the registry as cases related to diabetes are on the rise. Diabetes is one of the major killers today, that leads to organ failure,” he said.
 
 Tenders for operating dialysis units for health centres in Ponda, Mapusa, Valpoi and Navelim will be issued, the health minister said. He said that the outsourcing agency will be tasked in providing all diabetes related services to patients, adding that this will help reduce the burden on Hospicio and GMC. 
 
 During the function, the health minister felicitated paediatric cardiac surgeon, Dr Ravi Agarwal for performing over 50 free surgeries on children suffering from heart ailments. 
 
 Rane reiterated his commitment to providing the best quality healthcare facilities at GMC so as to reinforce the public trust in this government-run hospital. 
 
 He further applauded the efforts of GMC doctors headed by Dr Mimi Silveira and Dr Shirish Borkar as well as GMC’s cardiology department.
 
 GMC medical superintendent Dr Shivanand Bandekar, Dr Guruprasad D Naik, Dr Jagannath Kolwalkar and Dr Sunil Chandra Vidya Sagar were also present.
