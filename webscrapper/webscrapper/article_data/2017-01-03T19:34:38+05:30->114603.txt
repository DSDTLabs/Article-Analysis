 Allahabad: When cash crunch has adversely hit people for the past two months, the ‘child gods’, who meet their daily needs by begging at the Sangam, are also facing the brunt. These 4 to 10 years old children disguise themselves as Hindu gods to beg for alms. 
 
 Battling the cold, these kids, mostly tribal children from Vindhyachal and adjoining hilly areas, survive on alms which visitors offer them.
 
 Rupesh (10) was disguised as Lord Shiva. His younger sister Payal was dressed as goddess Durga. Strolling on the sands of Sangam, the two pester pilgrims to give them alms. They spend the spare time in playing on sand at the Sangam. 
 
 Before demonetisation, these kids used to earn much as visitors used to give them a note or two of Rs 10 or sometimes even 20. But things have changed now. Even these kids find it hard to ‘earn’ a few coins.
 
 Someone had robbed the dress of Krishna (Babloo) and Chhote Shiva (Gelua) and now they are waiting for their parents to get them new dresses so that they will once again start ‘earning’. 
 
 “Hamka ab log paisa hi nahi dete, kahte hai khana kha lo, paisa mat mango (now people don’t give us money. They are ready to provide food but not money),” Rupesh said. 
 
 Every morning, when tiny tots of thier age dress up to go to school, these kids start dressing up in their outfits. Payal’s mother Meena paints the faces of the kids, puts the wig and decorates it with artificial flowers, fake Rudrakash and gives utensil to keep alms.
