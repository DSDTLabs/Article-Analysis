Tirupur: The district collector K S Palanisamy has directed to disconnect electricity connections to two textile printing units for discharging effluents into open ground in Tirupur on Thursday. 

 Chairing the district coordination committee, the collector took the action based on the recommendations given by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) on the units which were located near Kangeyam Road and Dharapuram Road respectively.
 
 “Both the table printing units were discharging effluents about 1,500 liters in a day. Though the discharge is lesser comparatively, those effluents are pasty in nature and not easily dissolvable, which could affect the environment badly,” a higher TNPCB official said.
