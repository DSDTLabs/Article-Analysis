Even as Holi wishes from across the country flooded social media, popular TV anchor Rashmi Gautam stated that she had stopped celebrating the festival as she felt 'unsafe' while doing so. Rashmi, who's the anchor on popular show 'Extra Jabardasth', took to Twitter to voice her concerns about the festival. "Thankyou for the Holi wishes but Its been a few year that I have stopped playing Holi last was in 2014 as I was back home surrounded by my frnds and family otherwise I absolutely do not feel safe and many women out there Iâ€™m sure share the same fear (sic)," she tweeted.  

Meanwhile, some of Rashmi's colleagues went on to wish their fans on the occasion and showered social media with Holi posts. Popular anchor Ravi took to Twitter to wish his followers and urged them to celebrate the festival with organic colours.  "Holi ivaala kodhi sepu, repu kodhi sepu aadudham :) endhukante yevariki clarity ledhu Holi eppudu ani...kaani organic colours vaadandi & uti kodi gudlu tho aadukondi         (sic)," he tweeted.  

 Ravi's co-anchor Sree Mukhi too shared a 'Happy Holi' message, along with an image of hers which has her right cheek covered with colours.
