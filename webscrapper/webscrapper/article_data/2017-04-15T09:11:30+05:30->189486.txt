VADODARA: The   ( ), a registered union of the   (GUVNL) has declared that it will organize a mega rally on April 30 in the city in which 30,000 GEB employees from across the state will participate to press for their long pending demands.

 According to the union office-bearers their repeated demands to get the benefits of the seventh pay commission and hike pay of fixed-pay staffers have fallen to deaf ears. 
 
 “At every platform, we were assured that our grievances will be resolved. We waited for the budget session of Gujarat assembly to end. Yet, the promises given to us have remained unfulfilled,” said  , secretary general of AGVKS. 
 
 “In the beginning of March, we had approached Gujarat high court which had instructed the labour commissioner to submit its reply, within five weeks, regarding the breach of agreement which was made between GEB and our union in the office of the labour commissioner, Gandhinagar, on stamp paper of Rs 100 under section 2 (P) of the Industrial Dispute Act 1952. The reply was totally irrelevant,” he said. 
 
 “Through the agreement which was signed in 2009, it was agreed that as and when central and state government employees get the benefits of seventh pay commission, the benefits will be passed on to GUVNL employees. But the labour commissioner has totally ignored that portion of the agreement while submitting the reply to HC,” he said. 
 
 The union argues that even the   has extended benefits given to fixed-pay staffers to its ‘sahayak’ category in line with benefits given by state government on January 18. But, the same are not being extended to ‘vidyut sahayaks’,” he added. 
 
 The union of GEB employees has a strength of over 32,000 members across all the seven companies of GUVNL.
