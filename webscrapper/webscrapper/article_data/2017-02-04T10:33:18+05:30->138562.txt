BOKARO: Union Food Processing Ministry on Thursday gave its nod to a Mumbai-based   for setting up a mega   with an investment of Rs 225 crore in Rangamatia of Chandankyari block, close to Purulia district of West Bengal. 

 Residents of the area believe the food park would bring   and play an important role in the development. This will be the second major development which Chandankyari will see in a decade after the installation of   Limited (ESL) in Siyaljori.
 
 More than 50 food processing units will be installed in the food park. The food park will also draw investment of more than Rs 10,000 crore and different food processing units will be set up here. This will stop people from travelling outstation for work, a company official said.
 
 Initially, the food park will be developed in 130 acres but will later be expanded phase-wise to 400 acres. Around 5,000 residents will be directly or indirectly benefited with employment. Farmers in the area will get a huge business centre, where their grown crops, food grains and others will be purchased by the units. 
 
 State tourism minister Amar Kumar Bauri said the government has also allotted around Rs 133 crore for the reconstruction of a 44-kilometre-long Gawai Baraj canal to cater to the water requirements of the farmers. Besides, a mega power grid will also set up in Chandankyari. The basic facilities will enhance farming and speed up development in the area.
