PATNA: Police are yet to arrest the man who is suspected to have supplied fake Indian   notes (FICN) in the state capital.

 The supplier has been identified as Nitish Kumar (25) of Naurozpur village under the Sare police station area in Nalanda district. Police said he supplied huge quantity of FICN in Patna during the last six months.
 
 The FICN racket was busted after one Manish Kumar (22) was arrested from near A N College in Patna on Tuesday night. High- quality FICN worth face value of Rs 12,300 in Rs 100 denomination were recovered from his possession.
 
 City SP (central) Chandan Kumar Kushwaha said raids were on to nab Nitish. “Police are working on technical evidences to know more about the FICN supply chain,” he said.
 
 Shree Krishna Puri police station SHO Arvind Kumar said Manish, a native of Sarmera in Nalanda district, had been involved in the FICN racket for the last eight months.
 
 “He was purchasing FICN at half the rate of the face value,” the SHO said, adding Manish was expending the FICN in local markets in Boring Road, Pataliputra Colony and neighbouring areas. He was living in a rented accommodation in Pataliputra Colony with parents.
