LUCKNOW: Senior UP bureaucrats eyeing elevation to two coveted posts of chief secretary and agriculture production commissioner will have to wait for some more time.

 
 Reason: cabinet secretary PK Sinha has been given one-year extension and the state government is yet to accept the voluntary retirement of incumbent agriculture production commissioner RP Singh.
 
 With Sinha getting an extension, chances of UP chief secretary   being elevated to the topmost bureaucratic post in the country are all but over. There was wide speculation in bureaucratic circles that two top posts in the state would fall vacant after Kumar moved to Delhi and Singh took charge of his new assignment — chairman of   — after taking VRS. Rajive Kumar is due to retire on June 30 and RP Singh on July 30. Singh had applied for VRS in March but it is yet to be accepted.
 
 Kumar enjoys the trust of Prime Minister’s Office and was sent to the state on PMO’s initiative.
 
 After Kumar’s retirement, two senior most IAS officers in the state will be   and Pravir Kumar. There are other claimants too for the post of the chief secretary, but the BJP government’s recommendation for probe into the sale of 21 sugar mills during BSP rule may thwart their chances.
 
 Sources in the government said Singh is most likely to remain APC till his retirement. For APC post, four senior IAS officers are in the waiting — Rajive Kapoor, Chandra Prakash, Sanjay Agarwal and Sanjiv Sharan.
 
 While the bureaucratic reshuffle at the top level may get delayed, chief minister   is expected to effect changes at the principal secretary level. Some ministers have also expressed their displeasure over the functioning of their principal secretaries .
 
 Free from Karnataka campaigning, Yogi is also expected to transfer principal secretaries to ensure speedy implementation of the central and state governments welfare schemes in the run up to next year’s general elections.
