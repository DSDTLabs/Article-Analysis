NEW DELHI: The massive fire that broke out at a godown in   area of south Delhi on Tuesday evening was contained after an   team was deployed to spray water from a helicopter early on Wednesday morning. Fire officials say   were reported so far. 

 
 An   fitted with a bambi bucket sprayed almost 400 litres of water in several sorties that contained the flames early on Wednesday morning. Fire officials say that the strong winds through the night led the flames to spread to the adjoining buildings.
 
 
 
 
 Chief Fire officer Atul Garg said that the flames were contained by 6am after which the cooling operations were initiated. 
 
 While the cause of fire is yet to be ascertained, officials suspect that the fire originated from a truck parked adjacent to the godown. The truck too was gutted.
 
 The godown was used to store rubber which aggravated the fire, officials said. The burning of rubber led to thick cloud of black smoke emanating from the fire. This led to panic among the residents of the area who vacated their houses.
 
 The fire officials and cops also asked people living around the godown to move out as a preventive measure. The fire was reported around 5pm after which several fire tenders were rushed to the spot. By 9pm, 50 fire tenders had to be pressed into service. The godown was located beside Sant Nirankari school. The boundary wall of the school was also damaged in the fire.
 
 The police have filed an FIR to probe the incident. A witness is learnt to have told cops that a labourer was smoking a bidi and threw it while it was lit and this caused the fire. However, the police are yet to confirm the source of the blaze officially.
