Idukki: Tamil   government will raise the water level in Mullaperiyar dam to 152 feet, said Tamil Nadu deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam. While inaugurating the Mullaperiyar water flowing official function at   on Monday, he added that to fulfill the late Tamil Nadu chief minister  's ambition to raise the water level in   to 152 feet, “we will hold talks with the   government in this regard".
Theni MLA Venkitachalam and higher officials also attended the function.
 
 Now, Tamil Nadu is using 1,400 cubic feet of water from Mullaperiyar. With the water level increasing, it plans to divert more water for agricultural purpose.
 
 Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu government has decided to increase the water level in Mullaperiyar dam, even as the Kerala irrigation department officials on Saturday spotted new leaks in Mullaperiyar dam, where water level is slowly increasing. The leaks were spotted at two separate places inside the tenth and eleventh blocks of the dam. Leaks are being detected in these blocks for the first time.
 
 The leaks spotted are over 75 feet high on the dam.Water resource department executive engineer and SCappointed subcommittee member of the Mullapperiyar sub-committee George Daniel and other officials have visited the spot and submitted a report to the SC-appointed high power commit tee and subcommittee.
 
 “To measure the actual water level of the new leak of the 10 and 11 blocks of the dam, the subcommittee should visit the dam and calculate the seepage level of the water. When the water level is increasing, the leakage will also increase, “ say sources.
 
 Earlier, the supreme court directed that when the water level touches over 125 feet in the dam, the high power committee should visit it every week.
 
 However, now with the water level in the dam reaching 127.9 feet on Monday and going up, the SC-appointed committee hasn't bothered to visit the dam.
