CHANDIGARH: Marking the beginning of a four-day festival of dance and music organised by Chandigarh Sangeet Natak Akademi, Tagore Theater was graced by an exemplifying performance of 'Atirathis', a form of martial contemporary dance on Monday.

 Depicting the poignant tale of Karna, Kunti, Arjuna, Draupadi and Indra, a group of five artists from the  , New Delhi, depicted the combat between Karna and Arjuna as two valiant warriors in a never seen before spectacle by using a combination of Klarichpadh, Chhau, Kathak and Indian contemporary dance, leaving the audience in a suspended state of awe and disbelief.
 
 The theatrical performance was choreographed and directed by  , an Indian contemporary dancer and choreographer of international repute, who has been performing for over the course of the past 30 years.

 Karna and Arjuna, known as two valiant warriors, are important characters in the great Hindu epic of Mahabharata. Though the two striking personalities were always at loggerheads with each other, it is the concluding war between them which is the most cataclysmic and gripping. 'Atirathis', through the use of burning lamps, bow and arrows along with exceptionally incredible dance performances, explores Kunti's state of mind of letting go of Karna, followed by a final combat between Arjuna and Karan.
 
 The character of Kunti was depicted by Sangeeta Sharma, Karan was portrayed by Subhashish Dey, Draupadi by Tanya Gosweami, Arjuna by Umesh Bisht and Indra by Tushar Yadav.
 
 The duration of the performance was one hour.
