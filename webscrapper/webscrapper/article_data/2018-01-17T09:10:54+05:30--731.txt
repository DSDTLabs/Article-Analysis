JAMMU:   town of Jammu and Kashmir’s Rajouri district on Tuesday, over the   married to a Christian man, in which at least 12 people were injured. A place of worship, two shops and one tractor were also set ablaze.

 The deceased   Devi and her husband   both belonged to Hindu families in  . Kumar, however, embraced Christianity after shifting to Punjab’s Jalandhar where he worked as a labourer. The two got married afterwards and went on to settle in Punjab where they worked as labourers.
 
 When Seema’s body was brought to the village for the last rites on Monday, her family alleged that she had been murdered and was forced to change her religion before marriage. Following this, police took custody of the body for autopsy.
 
 On Tuesday, cops handed over Seema’s body for the last rites even as they provided escort. A heated argument shortly began between both families. While Seema’s husband and in-laws wanted to perform her last rites as per Christian customs, her family demanded the same to be done the Hindu way.
 
 Agitated by Kumar’s insistence to follow the Christian rituals, Seema’s family, supported by some   activists, roughed him up, vandalised his residence and set ablaze the place of worship in his house. The fire spread to two neighbouring shops and a tractor, which also got gutted.
 
 Soon after, the agitators grew in number following which police fired teargas shells to disperse them. At least a dozen people were injured in the ensuing clash. Sensing trouble, cops called in additional forces and reinforcements. With due intervention of senior administrative and police personnel, the situation was brought under control and Seema’s last rites were conducted as per Hindu rituals.
 
 Rajouri SSP Jugal Manhas said police are probing into the matter of alleged forced conversion.
