BHOPAL: Already reeling under staff crunch,   (RPF) from Madhya Pradesh has sent a company of 85 personnel for election duty in  , as a result of which both Bhopal and Habibganj stations don’t have enough personnel to keep a vigil at railway station, passenger security and trains.

 There are two sub-inspectors posted at Bhopal station, but they are looking after Nishatpura coach factory too, as the senior RPF official posted there has been sent to Punjab. “I had to hunt for RPF people across the platform 6 during the daytime to lodge a complaint about a snatching incident. There was no one available on Monday,” said Sunil Rai, a passenger from Itarsi.
 
 RPF has been divided into three divisions --- Jabalpur, Bhopal and Indore, and each division has sent equal number of personnel in the team. Now, only 7 to 10 RPF personnel are looking after everything, from checking platforms, registering complains and dealing with criminals at Bhopal railway station. Even the newly appointed TI Nihal Singh is yet to join the duty.
 
 There is a staff of about 20-25 personnel in shifts at both the stations who are supposed to be on field. Not only this, as soon as the elections are over in Punjab, they will be also be sent to UP on poll duty. When contacted, RPF commandant Ramashankar Prasad said, “We have been asked to send our personnel to poll-bound states. As far as security here is concerned, we have deployed the staff accordingly. Security of passengers is priority.”
 
 Pleading anonymity, a RPF guard said, “There is staff crunch at stations and for each and everything we have been getting calls to help them. Neither we are able to focus on work here nor there. Moreover, it is difficult for two or three people to look after the whole railway premises.”
