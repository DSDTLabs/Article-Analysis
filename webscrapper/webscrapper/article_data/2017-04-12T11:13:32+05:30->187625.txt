MEERUT: After fake Beti Bachao forms asked people to fill them for Rs 200-250, promising them money when their daughters turned 18, a new scam called 'Yogi packaging yojana' has now got thousands of mostly poor and illiterate women paying Rs 20 to get soap packaging work that promises them Rs 5,000 per month. 

  Police have begun investigating the matter. This comes days after   formally took over investigations in the Beti Bachao scam. 
 
  Sanjay Chauhan, an intelligence unit investigating officer in  , said, "We have received information about this fake scheme. We are trying to get hold of these forms and have also sent teams to various locations where women have been duped. We will soon get to the source." Another officer said, "Preliminary investigations suggest that agents of this scheme are part of a network whose kingpin is a woman from Baghpat. But we need to establish many other things, most importantly the extent of the fraud, before we move further." 
 
  According to residents, promoters of this fake scheme are mostly targeting semi-literate rural women. The scheme named after chief minister   states that "registered" unemployed women will be provided with items like soap, incense sticks and washing powder and be entrusted with the task of packing these for sale at government-sponsored outlets. In lieu of these services, an amount of Rs 5,000 will be credited to their bank accounts every month. 
 
  To make the whole thing look genuine, documents are required while filling up the forms which cost Rs 20 each. Saroj Kumari, a resident of Kandhla, said, "The agent had asked for two passport-size photos and a photocopy of our Aadhaar card." Perpetrators of this fraud have roped in women agents to convince unsuspecting women".
