CHANDIGARH:   has named Hardev Singh Ladi as its candidate for the upcoming Shahkot assembly bypoll. Over the past weeks, opposition parties had tried to scuttle his chances by levelling allegations against Ladi, who had lost the last assembly election to former Akali minister Ajit Singh Kohar, whose demise in February has necessitated the election.

 Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee ( ) general secretary.Ladi, 50, will take on Kohar’s son Naib Singh, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) candidate, while Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is yet to declare its candidate.
 
 After an alleged 13-minute “sting” video went viral, the AAP had written to chief minister Amarinder Singh to look into “deep connection of Congress MLAs and leaders with the mining mafia.” Ladi has, however, rejected the allegations as conspiracy against him.
 
 Even as senior Congress leaders like Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh and Rajinder Kaur Bhattal too had expressed willingness to contest the election if the party picks them, the Congress decided to repeat its choice for the last assembly polls.
 
 “Congress president Rahul Gandhi has approved the candidature of Hardev Singh Ladi for the ensuing by-election to the legislative assembly of Punjab from Shahkot constituency,” a statement from AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik said.
 
 An aide of former Punjab minister Rana Gurjit Singh, Laddi had unsuccessfully contested the 2017 assembly election but lost by 4,500 votes. 
 
 Meanwhile, with the issuance of notification for Shahkot by-poll, the process of filing nomination has also commenced but no one turned up to filed nominations on the first day. A spokesperson of Office of the Chief Electoral Officer said nomination could be filed till May 10 and the voting would take place on May 28. The result would be declared on May 31.
