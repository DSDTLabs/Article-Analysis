THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader   wrote to Prime Minister   on Saturday urging him to backtrack from the move to privatize central public sector unit   Ltd. Chennithala referred to a representation by joint action   at HLL to say that there was hectic move from the part of the Union government to disinvest shares of the profit making firm.

 He said thousands of people have been working in the company since 1967. “Moreover, the company has never incurred loss,“ he added. Chennithala said the diversification route taken by the company has multiplied its profit. He said HLL Lifecare is a reputed central   and there was no logic in privatizing it.
 
 The firm, which produces condoms under the brand Moods, has been exporting the same to several countries. Recently , it has started medical equipment manufacturing division and a diagnostics division named Hindlab that offers lab test and scanning at a much-reduced rate. A few days ago HLL inked a pact with Maharashtra government to start Hindlabs in government hospitals in Maharashtra.
