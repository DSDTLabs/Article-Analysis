Bengaluru: Two-wheeler riders will have to take a close look at the type of helmet they are using. Bengaluru city police on Thursday asked two-wheeler riders, including those on pillion, to wear only helmets with   mark. They will begin an enforcement drive against violators from February 1.

 The drive is part of a state-wide endeavour to deter riders from using half-helmets and, instead, go for safer headgear of assured quality. The move comes in the wake of a home department directive to police asking them to ensure only helmets with ISI mark are used. 
 
  
 Police commissioner T Suneel Kumar said two-wheeler users have time till January 31 to buy headgears with ISI mark. “From February 1, those wearing helmets without ISI mark will be penalized. They’d be treated as riding helmetless,” he said.
 
 The prescribed fine for ‘helmetless’ riders is Rs 100.
 
 In a release, additional commissioner of police (traffic) R Hitendra said that Section 129 of Indian Motor Vehicles Act says protective headgears should be used by two-wheeler riders. They should conform to the   (BIS) and users should check their quality.
 
 Headgears that cover the whole face come with ISI mark. Police consider other helmets as ‘half-helmets’ or those not conforming to BIS. 
 
 Karnataka police chief Neelamani N Raju has directed the state police to ban half-helmets and low-quality ones that come without ISI mark from February 1. This follows a directive from home minister R Ramalinga Reddy on Wednesday, which came while he was praising Mysuru city police’s initiative to book riders using unsafe helmets.
 
 The directive was issued to all five police commissioners —Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mangaluru, Hubballi-Dharawad and Belagavi — and also all range inspector general of police (IGPs) across the state.
