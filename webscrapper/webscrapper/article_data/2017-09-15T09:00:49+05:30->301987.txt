CHENNAI: Shock awaited Raghu*, father of the seven-year-old girl, who was raped, murdered and burnt at   on September 14. As the soon as the news broke about the Madras High Court quashing the detention of S Tashvanth, 22, under the Goondas Act, he took all precautions to hide it from his wife, who is still trying hard to come to terms with her daughter’s death. 

 A Mahila Court in   granted bail to Tashvanth, who was arrested in February. The court also quashed the suspect’s detention under the Goondas Act.
 
 Raghu, who met reporters on Thursday said he was disappointed by the development.
 
 On March 20, police slapped the Goondas Act on Thasvanth. His father applied for his bail in the Chengalpet Mahila Court and also filed a habeas corpus petition in front of the Madras high court (HC). The HC on Tuesday accused the police of not responding to the petition filed by Tashvanth’s father on time and of delaying the case. It further added that this was against the rights of the petitioner and set aside Tashvanth’s detention under Goondas Act.
 
 “Thasvanth’s father challenged that he would soon bring out his son on bail, but I had confidence in the law. Now the message seems to be loud and clear, even after committing a crime, a suspect can walk free,” Raghu said fighting to hide back his tears.
 
 Saying the trial should be speedy, he urged lawyers not to support people who commit such cruel offences. Actor  , who was at the press briefing, said if   has been granted bail, he should prove his innocence.
