CHENNAI: Tomato prices have dropped by half in one week in Chennai, traders reported on Thursday. 

 From a high of 120 last week, prices at   have come down to 60. 
 
 Some traders said it was because of supplies from   which have begun to come in, while some said that it was a price correction due to the demand-supply balance.
 
 "Prices are expected to fall down even further. As prices touched 120, the sale of tomatoes decreased due to the drop in buying capacity of people. Markets across the city started to take less orders of tomatoes from us. This has naturally brought down the prices," said R Soundarrajan, a wholesale dealer in Koyambedu, which is the market from where other smaller dealers take orders.
 
 Along with tomato, prices of other vegetables have also begun to drop. Beans was cheaper by 20, carrot by 30 and green chillies by 30, said the wholesale dealer.
 
 At   market however, prices of these vegetables are yet to see a dip and remained constant over the last few days. Tomato price was at 80, said  , a vegetable seller in the market. "But it has dropped by 10 in one day and is expected to drop further," he said.
 
 The price of other vegetables is also likely to drop further, say vendors, due to increase in production from neighbouring states.
