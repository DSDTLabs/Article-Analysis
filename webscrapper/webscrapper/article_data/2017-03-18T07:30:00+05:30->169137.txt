LUDHIANA: The city industrialists want the new government in the state to ensure transparency in the working of the excise and taxation department.

 Rajkumar Singla, president of Fasteners Suppliers’ Association, said, “It’s high time that changes be made in the excise and taxation department. There are various issues that should be looked into, especially delay in processing of VAT refunds. The government should pass a new law and ensure that 75% of VAT refund is transferred automatically into dealer’s account when he files VAT return. The remaining amount can be paid when he completes all formalities.”
 
 Narinder Bhamra, president of Fasteners Manufacturers’ Association of India, said, “The new leadership must fulfil its promise of making the working of the department more transparent. Besides, accountability should be fixed to check babudom and corruption in government departments.”
 
 Dinesh Kalra, president of  , said, “The department has not been able to clear the backlog of VAT refunds and obtaining a C-form is still fraught with difficulties. The government and the new excise and taxation commissioner of the state should make both VAT refund and C-form facility online, so that there is no pendency when GST comes into effect.”
