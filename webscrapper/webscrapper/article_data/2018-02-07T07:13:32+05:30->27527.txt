 A five-member committee was formed on Tuesday to investigate the matter after the seniors lodged a cross-complaint naming 11 junior students who had allegedly threatened them. Meanwhile, the 22 students named have been issued a show-cause notice and their entry on campus barred.
 
 Singh said the committee has been asked to probe whether the two groups clashed following a rivalry with each other or the juniors had been ragged as alleged. Authorities have decided to not lodge an FIR of ragging as of now because the incident took place eight months after the juniors joined.
