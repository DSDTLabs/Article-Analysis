AHMEDABAD: A 19-year-old youth,  , who died in a road accident on Saturday, will give a new lease of life to at least three persons, as his family members decided to donate his  . His family also tried to donate his heart and two eyes, but failed, as those vital organs were damaged in the accident, doctors said.

  Shubham, a second year BSc student, was a resident of Nikol. He met with an accident on May 19 on Bavla – Bagodara road in Ahmedabad district, when he was on his way to Bhavnagar for the event management firm he worked for. The accident occurred when Shubham’s bike slipped from the road and he sustained severe injuries leading to brain haemorrhage. 
 
 He was first treated at two Ahmedabad-based private hospitals and later shifted to Lions hospital in Mehsana, where he finally succumbed to his injuries.
 
 Shailesh Patel, his father, said, “When the doctors said that my son was brain dead, I decided that I will donate his vital organs to some needy people.”
 
 “I told the doctors to arrange   procedure so that my son may give a new lease of life to somebody else’s near and dear one,” said Patel, adding, “His vital organs like kidneys and liver were donated at the Mehsana hospital.”
 
 “The happiness of giving the organs of my son to some needy people has reduced the grief of losing him. I wish other people also become aware about organ donation,” Patel added.
 
 Recounting memories of his son, Patel said, “Shubham always wanted to remain independent. So, he started working with an event management company to reduce my financial pressure.”
 
 “He died but his organs will empower some other persons to become independent,” Patel said.
 
 Dr  , city-based cardiologist, said, “Shubham’s family wanted to donate his heart, too, but due to the accident, oxygen could not reach his lungs, and ultimately his heart could not be donated.”
