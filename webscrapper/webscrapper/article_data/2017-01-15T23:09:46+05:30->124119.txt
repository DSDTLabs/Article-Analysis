NEW DELHI: Batting maestro   on Sunday reacted to
  by gleefully tweeting a Bollywood reference that will escape very few people: he said his country had taken back ten times the 'lagaan' - or tax - it had paid.

  
 The tweet contains an apparent allusion to the plot of the 2001 Aamir Khan-starrer 'Lagaan,' in which a group of villagers in colonial-era India play a cricket match against a team of Britishers to avoid paying taxes. Since none of them know to play cricket, they're forced to learn - quite literally - to beat the British at their own game.
 
 Sehwag has lit up Twitter with his humour after India-England games before. After India whitewashed England 4-0 in last year's Test series, Sehwag had this to say:
 
  
 When India beat England in the 2016 Kabaddi World Cup, Sehwag tweeted, "England loose (lose) in a World Cup again. Only the sport changes."
 
 And when British journalist Piers Morgan corrected his spelling, Sehwag gave him some food for thought.
 
  
 Morgan, by the way, hasn't tweeted anything about today's result yet, but he did weigh in on skipper  's superb performance earlier.
