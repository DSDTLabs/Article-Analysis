AHMEDABAD:   of   got a rap from the   on Tuesday as they raised the vice-chancellorâ€™s decision to stay the student senate and welfare board elections.

 Justice   took the student unions to task and observed that they have plenty of time to build careers in politics and they ought to focus on their studies too.
 
 Referring to the agitation on the campuses of Gujarat University and affiliated colleges last week, the HC commented that the students do not bother about their own future. If they continue to behave in this manner, the vice-chancellor would not be able to do anything. The court said that students do not get proper representation because of the notoriety of student unions.
 
 The HC also sought an assurance from all student unions that the law and order situation on campuses would not be disrupted. The judge further said that even if students had reservations against the vice-chancellor, there was no need to go to the college where his wife works. 
 
 A further hearing on these issues is posted for Thursday.
