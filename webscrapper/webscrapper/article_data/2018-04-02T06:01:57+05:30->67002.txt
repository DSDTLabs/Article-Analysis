AHMEDABAD: Gujarat chapter of   (IMA) on Sunday raised concern over increasing the quota of private medical colleges from existing 15% to 50% and alleged that the states will get inadequate and unequal representation in the upcoming   ( ) bill which may be tabled in Lok Sabha on Monday. 

 The association threatened that if the bill is introduced in its existing form then they will observe ‘Allopathy-Mukta Bharat’ by withdrawing their services.
 
  
 A statement by the IMA-Gujarat chapter reads, “An issue of greater public concern is the percentage of medical seats that are going to be left to private managements. 
 
 In many states, the fee of around 85% of the medical seats is fixed by state governments. NMC will increase the quota of the private medical colleges from 15% to 50%.”
 
 “It is a dichotomy that on one hand the government speaks of doctors for rural areas and on the other hand, the same government provides increased quota for the rich. The NMC bill will push medical education completely away from the reach of deserving common people. This anti-poor pro-rich slant of NMC should be corrected,” it adds.
 
 The association further said, “The states get inadequate and unequal representation in NMC to the extent that many states remain unrepresented for years together,” and went on to add, “State health universities have lost their representation and state medical councils have lost their autonomy in the bill.”
 
 The Union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi also approved that the final MBBS examination should be held as a common examination throughout the country, and serve as an an exit test, to be called the National Exit Test (NEXT).
 
 The Cabinet on March 28 approved amendments to the NMC Bill including removing the contentious provision of “bridge course,” which would have allowed practitioners of alternative medicines to pursue allopathy.
