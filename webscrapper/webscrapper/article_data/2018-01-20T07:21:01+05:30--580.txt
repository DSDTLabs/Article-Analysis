LUCKNOW: For 21-year-old   Singh, this birthday will be a memorable one.

 The young man, suffering from  , was the station officer at SGPGI police station on Friday.
 
 He got the special permission from the SSP Lucknow after his father, a surgeon at SGPGI, made the request for his ailing child.
 
 Sahil has long cherished the wish to don a police uniform.
 
 “It was not a practical thing but our request was eagerly taken into account by the SSP,” said Dr  , a professor in the department of gastrosurgery at SGPGI.
 
 Sahil had not expected to be SHO   for six hours on his birthday.
 
 “I wished to don the khaki uniform since childhood. I want to become an officer like in the movies ‘Singham’ and ‘Dabbang’ and command people around me,” he said.
 
 On cloud nine while sharing his experience, he said he marched on the road and directed police personnel to manage the traffic properly.
 
 He fell short of words while describing his feeling of giving a command to a lower-rank policeman to register a complaint.
 
 “My son has brought laurels to the nation in swimming by winning a silver medal in the Special Olympics in 2013,” said Rajneesh.
 
 Sahil has completed Class X from NIOS and now is an assistant yoga teacher at a school in Gomtinagar.
