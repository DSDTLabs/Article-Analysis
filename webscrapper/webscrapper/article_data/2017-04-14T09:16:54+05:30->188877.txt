CHANDIGARH:   chief minister   on Thursday reiterated that any land in the state would not be acquired without the consent of the farmers. He also said the rates prescribed for the land to be acquired for development works would be paid to the farmers without any delay.

 Khattar said this at a function organized to celebrate the birth anniversary of peasant leader Chhotu Ram Chaudhary and Baisakhi in Jind. He said four regional centres would be set up under the horticultural university, which was coming up in Karnal. Out of these, the regional centre to be set up in   would be named after martyr Captain Pawan Kumar. The process to identify land for the centre would start soon.
 
 The CM said since agricultural land was shrinking, the farmers could earn more by getting engaged in agriculture-related business or horticulture. He said they could earn profit by taking produce to the mandis located in Delhi and Noida where there was huge demand of fruits, flowers and vegetables. “About four crore people reside in Delhi and nearby areas, and the farmers of Haryana can cater to their needs,” Khattar said.
 
 He further said the number of government jobs was limited and it was not possible to provide a government job to everyone. “A university is being set up for developing and honing the skills of youths through about 800 technical courses. Besides, the state government has been providing employment to youth under its ‘Saksham’ scheme and so far, about 9,000 capable youths have benefited from it. With a view to providing employment and self-employment opportunities to the youth, the state government is considering a proposal to expand the provisions of the scheme,” he said.
 
 On this occasion, the CM announced that the Haibatpur Chowk on   road in Jind would be named after Sir Chhotu Ram. He also announced a donation of Rs 21 lakh for development of the Jat Dharamshala, Jind.
