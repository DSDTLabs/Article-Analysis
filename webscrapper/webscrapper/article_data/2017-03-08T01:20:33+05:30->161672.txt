Chennai: An audio clip, alleged to be a phone call recording between rural industries   P Benjamin and Atther Ahmed, a member of activist group Arappor Iyakkam, sparked a controversy on Tuesday for the minister’s ‘Pakistani’ remark.

 Arappor Iyakkam, which plans to conduct a ‘Coffee with MLAs’ programme at Valluvar Kottam on March 19, is inviting the AIADMK MLAs who were lodged at Koovathur last month.
 
 In this connection, Ahmed told TOI that he rang Benjamin on Tuesday and was greeted with, “Jayaram Venkatesan or Zahir Hussain or Chandra Mohan?” (all members of Arappor) from the other end of the call. After Ahmed identified himself, he was asked if he was from the “OPS camp”.
 
 When Ahmed said he was calling as a citizen of India and a resident of Tamil Nadu, the minister’s response was: “You don’t speak like a Tamilian. You sound like a Pakistani.” Ahmed took objection to this and said, “Should all Muslims be from Pakistan sir?”
 
 The audio clip has been released on YouTube and is also being circulated on Facebook.
 
 “(Benjamin) cannot prejudice and add a communal angle. He was making me an enemy within my own country with such a remark,” Ahmed told TOI. Benjamin could not be reached for comment despite numerous attempts.
 
 Jayaram Venkatesan, convener of Arappor Iyakkam, said they were facilitating the event at Valluvar Kottam because they wanted to provide a “stage for the MLAs to come and answer the public” about their action during the confidence vote that led to Edappadi K Palaniswami becoming chief minister.
 
 Perambur MLA P Vetriivel, who has been invited for the event, said MLAs had been bombarded by “fake, paid callers” since the Koovathur saga began.
