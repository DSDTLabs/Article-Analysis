 “This is paddy transplanting season and we were apprehensive that the BSF might put some extra restrictions in crossing the border gates or advance the gate closing time given the recent border skirmishes with Pakistan. Thankfully, the force has shown generosity and is instead facilitating us when we need them,” said Amrik Singh, a farmer who owns six acres beyond the border fence, while talking to TOI on Monday.

There have been some instances where farmers in Ferozepur and Amritsar sectors were found cultivating poppy in their fields situated beyond fence so we have to take all measures since it is a matter of national security,” said a BSF inspector on duty at one of the border gate. 
 
 Agreeing to BSF claims, local farmer Sukhdev Singh said, “No doubt there are a few black sheep that have to be identified but majority of innocent farmers are suffering for acts of such people.” He said they felt secure in the presence of BSF ‘Kisan Guards’, who accompany them beyond border fence and provide them with security cover.
 
 Border Area Sangharsh Committee general secretary Rattan Singh Randhawa said, “Presence of   make farmers comfortable and instil confidence among them while working in the fields. Otherwise there is always risk of being attacked from the Pakistan side.”
