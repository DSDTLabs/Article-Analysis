THANE: Thousands of residents from the lake city suffered a lot of inconvenience on Thursday morning after   drivers went on a sudden   to protest against the high-handedness of the municipal administration last fortnight. 

 Auto drivers were asked to stay off road on Thursday as a mark of protest. Union leader Ravi Rao had circulated the message informing the drivers about the protest.
 
 However, this resulted in long queues at several auto stands like Satis, Teen Haath naka, Jambhli naka and Majiwada. Office-goers were affected the most as they had to either opt for other means of public transport or use fleet cab services.
 
 Many auto drivers who were plying on the road turned down commuters wanting to travel to old station area and Modella check naka as they feared that miscreants would damage their vehicles. But a few autos operated along GB Road and the suburbs. 
 
 “There were less autos plying the streets in my area in the morning. I had to wait for nearly 20 minutes to get an auto. I was unaware of the strike, else I would have made alternate arrangements,” said  , a GB Road resident. 
 
 A family that had come down from Nagpur had a harrowing time getting an auto from the station to reach their home at Ghodbunder Road.
 
 “Few auto drivers were quoting an exorbitant rate of Rs 600 to go to Ghodbunder Road. We eventually had to call up a fleet cab that arrived an hour late,” said an exasperated family from the city. 
 
 The protestors were upset with the manner in which the civic administration had dealt with auto drivers and hawkers last fortnight and were asking for a case to be registered against civic officials. 
 
 “We are angry with the manner in which the civic chief tried to intimidate auto men and hawkers. Everyone has a right to earn his livelihood and though discipline must be maintained violence is no excuse,” said union leader Ravi Rao. However, by afternoon, the situation was normal and the autos were seen back on the road.
