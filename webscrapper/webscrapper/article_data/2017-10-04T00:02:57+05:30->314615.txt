Chennai: It was not part of the syllabus they were trying to master, but when a few IAS aspirants on Monday night saw a woman trying to save her gold chain from two men in Anna Nagar, they decided not to go by the book.

 They ran to the spot and encircled the two men and caught one of them and handed him over to police. Officers identified him as Manikandan, 27, of Anna Nagar and recovered a 11 sovereign gold chain. Based on the information provided by Manikandan, police nabbed his aide Siva of Mogappair on Tuesday. A court has sent the two men to jail.
 
 Around 7.15pm on Monday, police said, 60-year-old Krishnakumari was walking alone on Anna Nagar Ninth Main Road when a man approached her and asked her about an address he was trying to locate. As the unsuspecting woman was telling him how to reach the place he had asked for, he snatched her 10 sovereign gold chain. He then ran to where an aide was waiting on a bike and the two zoomed off.
 
 A shocked Krishnakumari immediately called up the police control room on her mobile phone and related the sequence of events. The jurisdictional police were informed and patrolling team of personnel was sent to the spot where the robbery took place.
 
 By then, the two suspects had travelled a few streets away. Emboldened by the fact that they had not been caught, they decided to target another woman. It was while they were trying to snatch her chain that the group of IAS aspirants happened to be there and nabbed them.
