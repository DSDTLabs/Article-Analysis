PATNA: A gang of criminals in Patna has somehow mastered the technique to open   machine hoods and tamper with it in such a way that the money withdrawn is not debited from the bank account concerned.

 Writer’s Corporation North East India regional security head Sudhanshu Singh has lodged an FIR with the Pirbahore police station in Patna in connection.
 
 The FIR says two suspected youths withdrew Rs 1.3 lakh from five Canara Bank ATM machines in Patna on February 28.
 
 Singh said the matter came to light after an audit of the ATM transactions at the five kiosks. The authorities subsequently scanned the CCTV footage which showed the criminals tampering with the ATM machines.
 
 “These ATM kiosks near Patna University, Khazanchi Road, New Rajendra Nagar, Tripolia Hospital and Mithapur bus stand areas did not have security guards around midnight when the criminals struck,” Singh said.
 
 Senior bank officials said the fraudsters tampered with the ATM machines in such a way that the inbuilt sensors became non-functional and could not send alerts to the switch centre about the cash disbursal. 
 
 “Every bank has an individual switch centre in the country, which is the command centre of all its ATMs across the country,” one retired banker said, adding similar incidents were earlier reported from Odisha, Bengal and Gujarat.
 
 When contacted, Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said a police team was at work to crack the case.
