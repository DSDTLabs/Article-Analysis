NAGPUR: Irfan Sheikh (24) was stabbed with sharp knife over old rivalry by his two neighbours in   at New Kamptee, on Sunday.

 The accused have been identified as   (30) and   (40). Police have registered an offence of attempt to murder against the duo and also arrested them.
 
 The cops produced them before the court which remanded the duo in police custody, on Monday.
 
 Police said earlier, Sheikh (a labourer) was booked for thrashing Hirkhan under section 324 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as he used to verbally abuse him over trivial matters. Sheikh was sent behind bars too but was released on bail later.
 
 After he came out of the prison, Meshram and Hirkhan decided to take revenge, police said.
 
 On late Sunday night, Sheikh was returning to his residence when he was intercepted by the duo.
 
 They entered into a heated argument over old issues and started pushing each other. Sheikh tried to leave the place, but the duo grabbed him and stabbed on his chest and stomach before fleeing from the spot.
 
 Local residents rushed him to Mayo Hospital where he is still undergoing treatment. Doctors have declared that Sheikh is out of danger.
