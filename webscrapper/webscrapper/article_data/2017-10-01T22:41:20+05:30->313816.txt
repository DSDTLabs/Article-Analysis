Meerut: Nearly a fortnight after two brothers, Dilshad Ahmad and Munshad, were shot dead allegedly by Dharamvir Singh and his associates over a parking dispute in Meerut’s Sanota village, police on Sunday arrested one of the main accused in the case. A pistol of .315 bore was seized from Ravi, who also happens to be Dharamvir Singh’s son. So far, seven people have been arrested in the case, while 11 others are still on the run.   “Ravi was arrested on Sunday from Kacheri crossing in Meerut. We have seized one pistol (.315 bore), one live cartridge and one used cartridge from his possession. Efforts are on to arrest the remaining accused,” said Janak Singh Chauhan, station house officer, Falawada police station.    All 18 accused in the case have been booked under IPC Section 302 (murder). The incident was reported from Sanota village, about 5 km from Meerut city, on the night of September 14. Officials had said that Munshad Ahmad and Dariyao Singh quarreled over parking a car in front of Singh’s house. Soon, supporters of both men gathered there and the argument turned violent. Stone pelting and firing was reported from the spot and Munshad Ahmad, 24, and his brother Dilshad, 27, received multiple bullet injuries. They both succumbed to their injuries later.    Fearing that the incident may take communal colour, Meerut SSP Manzil Saini had rushed to the spot with heavy police force. Manzil had said that the incident was not of communal nature as political enmity had been simmering between the two groups for quite some time. In fact, Dariyao Singh was being supported by a few members from another community, police had said.
