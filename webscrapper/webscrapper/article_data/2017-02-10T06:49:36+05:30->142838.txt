 It's an opportunistic move of weaker parties.   was down to two seats in 2014 and SP won five. BSP drew a blank.There's a Narendra Modi wave.SP was scared of another drubbing, joined hands with the Congress, which is struggling to stay relevant.
 
 
 
 
 The riots reflected the region's law and order crisis. I went to the violence-hit areas and saw migration. The BJP can't be responsible for the failure of law and order in UP.
 
 
 
 
 Migration happened in Kairana. We have seen the abandoned houses. Triple talaq is unjust to Muslim women. Our manifesto pledges legislation to discontinue it only after seeking views of Muslim women.
 
 
 
 We talk development, inclusiveness and expect the minority to understand the opposition's gameplan. Those talking caste or community believe in divide and rule.
 
 
 
 
 The party decides constituencies. I thank BJP president Amit Shah for this opportunity .Noida's people have been gen erous with their overwhelming response, evident during Amit Shahji's rally.
 
 
 
 
 People don't question the intent behind the move. Many traders backed demonetisation.
 
 
 
 
 Such commitments are only after research on viability .
 
 
 
 
 Our party president said  's children will be born potential CMs. I've got this opportunity after 15 years of hard work.
