Mollywood is going to witness a new star combo this time,   and Njandukalude Naatil Oridavela fame  . The two will team up for a romantic mystery thriller, titled  . 

 Says Ahaana, “There is nothing happy-go-lucky about it, and it will be a very intense film. Tovino plays the title character, Luca, while I play his lover, Niharika. I’m looking forward to the shoot, as my character has a lot of scope for performance. It’s a huge opportunity for someone like me.”
 This will be the first feature film for Arun Bose, a professor at Madras Christian College, who has done a handful of documentaries earlier. The shoot of the film will begin as soon as Tovino gets some free time post his current commitments. “The makers are all friends and Tovino has known them for years. So he has introduced all of them through a live video,” says Ahaana.
 
 Arun and Mridul George have co-written the script for the film, which will be Ahaana’s third movie.
