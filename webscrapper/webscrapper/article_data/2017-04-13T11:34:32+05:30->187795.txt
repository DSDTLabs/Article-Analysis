KOCHI: The death of 12-year-old Amal* -- who had been waiting for a donor heart for the past several months -- at a private hospital in Kochi a fortnight ago could have been avoided if doctors on the panel authorized to certify brain deaths had done their job. It is the latest standoff in   in the state that took his life.

 The empanelled doctors no longer want to take any risk or get caught up in allegations of earning monetary benefits through transplant  , and this has almost brought cadaver donations in the state to a grinding halt.
 
 As many as 72 cadavers were donated last year as against just five in the first three-and-a-half months this year. And, patients waiting for organ transplantations are at the receiving end. “The delay had cost the life of another child also recently. I had sent two patients to other states for transplants,” said Dr Jose Chacko Periyappuram, who had conducted 22 heart transplant surgeries. “The empanelled doctors should certify the deaths. It is up to the state government to take the initiative.”
 
 The state government had ordered for videographing the certification procedures from January on the basis of a court order. “Since then, the empanelled doctors are not certifying brain deaths; they don't want to face the legal problems. In all the five donations this year, relatives had approached authorities with requests to donate the cadaver,” said Dr Noble Gracious, nodal officer,   (KNOS).
