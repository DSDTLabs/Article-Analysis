LUCKNOW:   on Tuesday caught many off guard. People in the market areas were affected worst. According to   (UFBU), the strike was to press their 11 demands. 

 People who have accounts in central and state government banks, faced a tough time and many of them were taken by surprise when they found the banks closed as part of the nationwide strike.
 
 It was mostly the businessmen who were affected, particularly in Aminabad, Chowk, Nakhas, Hazratganj, Kaiserbagh, Alambagh, Latouche road, Hewett road and other market areas. Those who do not use ATM, debit and credit cards were also seen harried. 
 
 Many people who had came to   or encash cheques were seen contacting banks's customer care centres to confirm when the strike would be called off but there was no satisfactory response. While people came to know the status of their cheque clearance and had to do their important payments were seen worried as clearance of their cheques were stopped.
 
 Shyam Prasad Ahuja, who came to encash a cheque given to him by a dealer at Bank of Baroda's Aminabad branch said, "I have to pay for goods and a day's delay would lead to 10% penalty." 
 
 National confederation of bank employees said bank employees did overtime after demonetisation but   and government are not ready to fulfill any of the 11 demands raised.
