Vadodara: The leader of opposition in the Dahod municipality has been named as a prime accused in the case of alleged irregularities that came to light during the Gujarat board exams at a school in the town. 

 Nazmuddin Gangardiwala is the general secretary of the management of the school where the incident took place and has been named as an accused in a graft case in the past too.
 
 Dahod district administration officials had swooped down upon the M & P High School after receiving information regarding irregularities during the exams there. The information had come soon after the Gujarati subject exams began at 10am.
 
 When the teams reached the school, a room in one of the blocks there was locked. The block is usually used by the management of the school. The officials as well as Gangardiwala were evasive when keys to the room were sought and it had to be forced open. A torn copy of the Gujarati subject question paper, a textbook of the subject, a rose and some paper slips were found there along with a photocopying machine.
 
 An offence registered regarding the incident on Monday night names Gangardiwala as well as principal of the school D K Patel and supervisor of the school P M Patel as accused. It states that Gangardiwala’s evasive replies regarding the key to the room and his not giving it indicated at his involvement.
 
 Gangardiwala along with the principal of another school has been named as an accused in a graft case in 2016. The duo had sought bribe from school teachers to release the arrears of their Sixth Pay Commission benefits.
 
 Dahod town police inspector K G Patel said that evidence was being gathered regarding the incident and statements would be recorded. “We will proceed with arrests after having sufficient evidence on hand,” he said.
