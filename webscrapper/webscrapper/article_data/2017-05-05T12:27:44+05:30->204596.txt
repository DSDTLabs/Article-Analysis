But we clarified that the VTU had lost the SC case as it had appealed under Section 10 (23C) of the I-T Act and the apex court had said this section does not apply and dismissed the matter." Rayareddi said the state government is asking the Centre to provide relief under Section 119(2)(b) of the I-T Act in view of public interest as 217 engineering colleges are affiliated to the VTU with 4 lakh students pursuing various courses. He said many private universities have been granted with tax exemptions and denial of the same to the VTU would be a "great injustice". LUX ARD
