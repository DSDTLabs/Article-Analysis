BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh high court (MPHC) on Friday granted bail to former director of medical education department (DME) and former joint director of medical education department N M Shrivastava. They are accused in PMT-2012 scam and had surrendered in court after the CBI filed charge-sheet against them in a Bhopal court earlier last year.

 A division bench of the MPHC comprising Chief Justice   and Justice   granted bail to two former DME officials citing the fact that they have been in jail for over a month. The CBI, the prosecution agency in the case, had opposed bail to the two.
 
 The accused in question have been accused of colluding with private medical colleges and allowing them to admit students, who had not qualified for admission in MBBS courses through PMT in 2012. They have been charged under sections 420, 467, 468 and 120 (b) of the IPC for alleged fraud and criminal conspiracy. They were in jail under judicial custody since February 14. Senior counsel   appeared for the accused in the case.
