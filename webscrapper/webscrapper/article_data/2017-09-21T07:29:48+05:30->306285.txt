GHAZIABAD: A 27-year-old man, who was picked up four days ago in connection with a robbery case, died in   on Tuesday, prompting the district magistrate to order a magisterial inquiry into the circumstances that led to his death.

 The   prisoner,  , with injury marks all over his body, was shifted to MMG Hospital late on Tuesday night, where he was declared dead.
 
 His family members alleged that Jawed was beaten up by jail staff, leading to his death. 
 
 “My brother was picked up by Indirapuram police four days ago in a robbery case and was later sent to Dasna jail. On Sunday, we met him in jail and found him in good health,” claimed Jawed’s brother Masroor Ahmed.
 
 “On Tuesday night, we got a call and we were told that Jawed was not well. When we went to see him at the hospital, he was dead. He had injury marks all over his body and it looked like he was badly beaten up,” alleged Ahmed. “Just imagine the plight of his wife, who gave birth to a daughter just a week ago.”
 
 The brother alleged that Jawed’s enemies got him killed in the jail. 
 
 “We have a dispute with some anti-social elements in our locality. They had threatened to kill Jawed on several occasions before. So, they got him implicated in a robbery case and in connivance with jail officials, killed him inside the jail,” he added.
 
 When contacted, SSP Hari Narayan Singh said police arrested Jawed in connection with a case in which a man was robbed of Rs 4 lakh in March. 
 
 “It has been alleged that he was beaten up in jail. So, we are waiting for the post-mortem report, after which the matter will be investigated,” added Singh.
 
 On Wednesday, Jawed’s family members met district magistrate Ritu Maheshwari and apprised her of the incident. “I have ordered a magisterial inquiry into the death of Jawed Ahmed and the guilty would not be spared,” she said.
