AHMEDABAD: Three schools of the city allegedly denied admissions to students, who had secured admission under Right to Education (RTE) Act. These schools named by parents include  , Shahibaug,   in Viratnagar and Pragati School in Maninagar. Parents of students who have been allocated admissions as per   are supposed to confirm their admissions by May 25.

 When parents approached the schools with admission letters, school authorities refused to accept them. After this, parents registered a complaint with the district education office. The DEO will now initiate proceedings for ensuring that the students get admissions under RTE.
 
 Jayesh Chavda, a parent, said that he approached St Marks School and supplied admission letter from the DEO office, but the school management refused to admit his kid. There were heated exchanges of words between parents and the school authorities. “Four to five parents, whose children were denied admission, filed a complaint with the DEO office later,” Chavda said.
 
 The parent of a student who secured admission in Gnanoday School in Shahibaug alleged the school refused admission under the pretext of being a minority school. Similarly, St Marks School authorities claim they are yet to receive an intimation from the state education department about the admissions, and therefore are in no position to admit students.
 
 “We will inform the respective schools to admit the students as complaints have been received,” said in-charge DEO, Mahesh Mehta.
 
 Parents on Monday staged a protest outside the district education office over the issue of denial of admissions by certain schools and not alloting schools preferred by the candidates.
