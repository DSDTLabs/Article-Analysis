Panaji: Family members of an 87-year-old woman, Rosalina Almeida of Tonca, Caranzalem, alleged that Panaji MLA Sidharth Kuncalienkar prevented them from accompanying her to the EVM on Saturday afternoon.

 In his defence, Kuncalienkar says that he was following EC guidelines. The incident took place at polling station no. 28 at PWD Division IV, Tonca. “There was no wheelchair for her at the booth. On being instructed by the polling staff, I filled up the form to accompany my mother-in-law, who needs assistance while walking, her hands tremble, she is hard of hearing and has weak eyesight,” Rosalina’s daughter-in-law Ruby Almeida said . 
 
 “At that moment, Kuncalienkar prevented me from entering the booth with my mother-in-law, saying that only polling staff should be allowed inside. He even asked me to produce a medical certificate that the elderly woman had weak eyesight,”said Almeida. Rosalina was accompanied to the EVM by a polling official. “She doesn’t even know whom she voted for,” Almeida said.
 
 Kuncalienkar, when contacted, said, “Only polling officials should be allowed into the booth as per EC guidelines.”
