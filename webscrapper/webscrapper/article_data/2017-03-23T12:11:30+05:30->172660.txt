NAGPUR: An election petition has been filed before the senior civil judge against corporators of Ward No 21B and 21C —   and Abha Pande — claiming that they failed to submit proper affidavits along with nomination forms, and therefore their candidature should have been rejected.

 The petitioners are contestants of   ( ) elections — Sharad   and Shila Kamde, who lost to the respondents. They claimed the elected candidates did not sign the affidavits before notary, which renders it illegal and invalid. The duo also claimed that nomination forms of all other candidates in the wards, except theirs, were liable to be rejected on the same grounds.
 
 Padole and Kamde have asked that they be declared as corporators elected unopposed in their respective wards. The civil court issued notice all respondents, including NMC, returning officers and all contestants. The court has also instructed NMC and returning officers to keep records sealed and in safe custody.
