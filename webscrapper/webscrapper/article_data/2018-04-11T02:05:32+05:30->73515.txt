THANE: The Thane anti-extortion cell has taken statements of five Right to Information (RTI) ‘activists’ suspected to be repeatedly misusing the   Act for personal gains and alleged blackmailing. 

 The police have asked the five in detail about the RTIs they have filed.
 
 After carrying out an internal probe, the Thane Municipal Corportion identified 10 such activists, mostly from political parties, who had filed RTI queries with the civic body.
 
 Police said that the names were shortlisted on the basis of repeated RTI filings. It would so happen that once the civic body would reach a stage of redressal of the complaints, these activists would withdraw the same. 
 
 “Others have also been summoned and their statements will be recorded in the next few days,” said R V  , police inspector from the anti-extortion cell. 
 
 The inquiry was conducted after a Shiv Sena MLA had raised the issue during the winter session. The state, in its reply, had said that an inquiry would be conducted and if anyone is found guilty, then appropriate action will be taken. Subsequently, the state government then ordered the Thane police to conduct an inquiry and police commissioner   directed the anti extortion cell of the crime branch to carry out the probe.
 
 The cell, led by  , sought an internal inquiry report from the  . “The report contained 1,273 pages on the errant ‘activists’, who repeatedly sought information on development proposals,” said Sharma.
 
 He added that if the RTI activists had not done anything wrong they need not worry, but if they have, then there is definitely a reason to worry.
 
 The neighbouring Palghar police had filed 11 cases of extortion against 20 people, mostly political party officer-bearers, including Dhananjay Gawde, Shiv Sena corporator in the Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation, Govinda Gunjalkar, Vasai Nationalist Congress Party chief and Arun Singh, Bhartiya Janata Party youth wing general secretary of Palghar among others.
