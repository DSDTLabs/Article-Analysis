AHMEDABAD: The first cluster of the final placement process for the postgraduate programme (PGP) class of 2017 was held on Monday at the campus of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A).

 The firms that participated in Cluster 1 comprised of three cohorts – investment banking and markets; management consulting and private equity, venture capital and hedge funds.
 
 “The list of Cluster 1 recruiters included regular partners such as Accenture Strategy, A.T. Kearney, Bain & Co.,  ,  , JP Morgan, McKinsey & Company, Oliver Wyman and others,” said a statement from the placement cell of IIM-A.
 
 “This reinforces the strength of the general management programme at IIM-A. McKinsey & Company made the highest number of offers, 15, in Cluster1. Finance companies offered roles in investment banking, private equity, venture capital and capital markets across functions and geographies,” added the statement.
 
 IIM-A has always had an extremely rich mix of firms from diverse sectors. Consulting firms, offering management consulting roles across geographies, continued to hire in large numbers, it said.
 
 The second cluster will be held on February 16. Last year, more than 110 companies participated in the IIM-A placement process. Around 100 students had then opted for their dream applications, which gave them the flexibility to build careers in sectors of their preference.
