Pune: The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) will hold its 112th convocation ceremony on January 20. Over 97,000 students — on and off campus — will receive their degrees.

 “This is the first convocation after the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016 came into effect. Eminent scientist Raghunath Mashelkar will be the chief guest. We will be giving out 347 PhD degrees and 58 gold medals. In addition, 17,533 postgraduate students will receive their degrees on the day,” said SPPU vice-chancellor NR Karmalkar.
 
 Degrees of the remaining 79,221 students will be sent to their respective colleges from where they can collect them.
 
 The controversial gold medal which was constituted by Yog Maharshi Ramchandra Gopal Shelar’s family for non-science stream postgraduate students will not be presented this year. “The family has agreed to remove the criterion that makes it exclusive for vegetarian students. Now, we have to pass the proposal in academic and management councils and reinstate it afresh,” said Karmalkar.
