PUNE: A private bank customer almost lost a huge chunk of her life savings as Rs2.5 lakh was deducted from her account for a policy she never bought. 

 Dimple Dharmawat, an   customer, said that on March 10 she received an SMS alert about Rs 2.5 lakh debited from her account. Recovering from an ankle injury herself, Dharmawat immediately sent her husband to the Khadki branch of her bank. However, the bank officials insisted on her physical presence to even take congnizance of the matter.
 
 Dharmawat told TOI: "The account was dormant, so when I got a message I was shocked. I had to go the bank despite my ankle fracture." 
 
 Dharmawat was told at the bank that the amount has been debited towards the payment of an Ulip policy she supposedly bought from the bank's life insurance arm. When she told them that she never bought any policy, the officials asked her to get in touch with the  . On Friday when the family threatened to file a case, the bank deposited the money back into her account without giving any explanation.
 
 When contacted, the bank's spokesperson said, "It should not have happened... This is a case of an inadvertent mistake where money was debited from Dharmawat's account towards payment of premium for a life   of another customer. This happened as the 12-digit account number of Dharmawat and that of the other customer were almost identical. However, immediately after receiving her complaint, the money was returned to her account. We sincerely regret the error."
