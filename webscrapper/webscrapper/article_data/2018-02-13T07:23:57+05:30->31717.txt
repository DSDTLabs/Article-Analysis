CHENNAI: Institute of Chinese Studies director   has urged academics and think tanks to chart out a blueprint for people-to-people relations between India and China. 

 Kantha was speaking at a seminar on the matter organised by Centre for Public Policy Research, Chennai Centre for China Studies and Press Institute of India. He said the popularity of yoga and Indian movies and the increase in the presence of Indian students in China show that bilateral relations are positive. “We need a nuanced approach with confidence so we can cover the gap between the two countries. We should use not allow differences to become disputes,” he said.
 
 He further added that constraints in people-to-people relations should be identified and resolved. He said that when the government wanted to ease visa norms for Chinese visiting India, one ministry objected. “The new visa system was introduced but issues remain. Inviting a Chinese researcher for a conference or meeting is still an uphill task,” he added.
 
 “Chinese are travelling abroad but not many come to India. Trade is growing but at slow pace. Make use of the growth of China’s economy by viewing it as an opportunity. We must recognise and build on progress. The presence of 20,000 Indian students in China is a strength,” the director said.
 
 B S Raghavan, former chief secretary of Tripura and policy advisor to the   ( ) said, “China produces a complex in Indian minds. We must make a decision to leave the past behind and look forward in a self-confident and balanced manner.”
