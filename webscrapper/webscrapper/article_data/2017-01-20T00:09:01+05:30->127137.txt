Indore: MPPKVVCL has issued an advice to Indore Municipal Corporation regarding its unauthorized use of power from overhead supply lines for street lights in the city. The power distribution company has instructed the civic body to avoid using power without an authorised connection. The company officials have even started collecting details of areas where its connection is being used to power street lights. The instruction came after the power distribution company noticed unauthorised connections in Aerodrome area in the city. “These connections were being used to power street lights that too without permission,” said MPPKVVCL’s superintendent engineer Subroto Roy. He said that an advice has been issued to concerned authorities of Indore Municipal Corporation to get regular connections for this purpose.
