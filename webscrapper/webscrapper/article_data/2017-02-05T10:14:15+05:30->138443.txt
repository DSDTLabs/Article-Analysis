ROHTAK: Rejecting contractual jobs offered to family members of youths killed during the   last year,   (AIJASS) convener   on Saturday said the   should not renege on its promises.

 Malik, who was at the Jat dharna site at Ramayan village of Hisar district, said there were no new demands from their side. “Our dharna is only against the government’s dilly-dallying attitude, failure to fulfil its promises and deliberately prolonging the issue,” said Malik, who also visited Kaithal and Jind on Saturday.
 
 Malik said Jats who took part in dharnas last year were being served notices to weaken their protest. “Protesting for ones demand in a democratic set-up is a constitutional right and the government should not make the mistake of scaring us. Else there will be consequences,” he said.
 
 Serving an ultimatum to the administration to accept their demands by February 11, Malik said if their demands were not accepted, the Samiti would intensify its stir on February 12 and hundreds of dharnas would be held across the state. 
 
 He also gave a call to commemorate the death anniversary of Sandeep Karwasra in Hisar on February 19 and urged the community to assemble in lakhs. On the issue of contractual jobs for family members of the deceased, he demanded government jobs as promised earlier. Malik also called for a probe against BJP MP Rajkumar Saini by the Parliament Ethics Committee. 
 
 Leaders of various khap panchayats, including Sangwan khap, Nandal khap, Ahlawat khap, Antil khap, Kaliraman khap, Kajla khap, Boora khap, Panchgami khap, Rohel khap, Singhmar khap, Panchgami khap and representatives of different castes and communities were also present at the gathering.
