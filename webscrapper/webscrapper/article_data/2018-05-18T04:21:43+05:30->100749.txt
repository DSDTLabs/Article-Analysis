MUMBAI:   and   BEST committee members demanded that general manager Surendra Bagade be sent back as they expressed unhappiness with his style of functioning.

 
 The trigger for a tirade against Bagade was faulty electronic ticket-issuing machines (ETIMs). Around 65% Trimax machines, introduced in 2010, do not work, and commuters are often given paper tickets.
 
 Former BEST committee member Anil Kolil said, “We do not want Bagade as   as the administration has not taken steps to resolve the Trimax issue despite a report by a sub-committee.” BEST committee chairman Ashish Chemburkar said no steps have been taken to replace or upgrade the software or hardware of the machines.
 
 Congress member   supported the Sena and said his party will support a no-confidence motion against Bagade in   too.
