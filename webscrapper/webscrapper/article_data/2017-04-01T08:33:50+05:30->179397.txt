NAVI MUMBAI: A minor boy, who, was driving his father's car, allegedly knocked down a senior citizen in Navi Mumbai on Monday morning, causing her death. The 17-year-old collegian who resides in Kharghar has been arrested. He lost his father only a month back. 

 The police said that the teenager was at the wheel of the   i20 and was driving recklessly. The deceased woman, Surekha Sharma (61), who also lived in Kharghar, was returning home from the market. Around 10.30 am, Sharma was crossing the street near Shilp chowk, across the building in which she lived, when the car hit her from behind, knocking her down.
 
 "She was thrown off the road and landed with severe head and body injuries," said a police officer, adding that Sharmawas rushed to Panvel rural hospital. "She was declared brought dead on arrival."
 
 Senior police inspector Dilip Kale said that the boy did not attempt to run away from the accident spot. "He was visibly scared after seeing the woman in a pool of blood," said Kale, adding that the boy's car was severely damaged as it had crashed into the divider of the road. 
 
 People who gathered at the spot on hearing the crash held the boy till the police reached the spot and took his custody.
 
 Since the boy is a minor, and did not possess a valid licence, there is a provision in the Motor Vehicle Act to issue a challan to the car owner for handing over the keys to the minor, said Kale. If the car owner is proven guilty, he faces three months' imprisonment and Rs 1,000 penalty. "But in this case, the car is registered in the name of the minor boy's father who passed away about a month ago," said Kale.
