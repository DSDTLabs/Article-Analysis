 There has been no hike in property taxes since 1992. The civic administration had proposed the tax hike several times in the past, but the NMC's standing committee and the general body meetings had rejected the proposals.
 
 On April 2, the NMC's standing committee had rejected the hikes in both the taxes as proposed by the civic chief in his budget for the 2017-18 financial year. Now, the civic administration has once again decided to table the proposal for hike in property and water taxes at a meeting of the standing committee.
 
 Speaking to TOI, municipal commissioner   said, "We have proposed hikes in property and water taxes. The proposal for the tax hike is now to be tabled in the coming meeting of the NMC's standing committee for approval." 
 
 The hike suggested in the property tax is around 20%. Moreover, water taxes are also to be increased somewhere in the range of 11-20%. 
 
 Currently, the civic body is levying a water tax of Rs 5 per 1,000 litres for residential purposes. As per the new proposal, it has been suggested that Rs 6 will be charged per 1,000 litres, with 20% hike in taxes. Water tax for commercial purpose is Rs 27 per 1,000 litres, which has been proposed to Rs 30 per 1,000 litres, with 11% hike.
 
 Water tax for non-residential purpose is Rs 22 per 1,000 litres. The civic administration has proposed a 13% hike to Rs 25 per 1,000 litres. "In 2016-17, the target for water tax collection was Rs 40 crore, but we recovered Rs 29.5 crore. This year, the target for water tax is Rs 43 crore. There are around 1.89 lakh water connections, of which around 1.78 lakh are residential, 2,973 are non-residential and 3,572 are commercial," an official said.
