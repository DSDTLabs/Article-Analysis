MUMBAI:   government’s   seem to be paying off as lake levels in and around Mumbai, Pune and Nashik are at their highest in three summers. 

 At a time when 140 districts in north India have already gone dry ahead of peak summer (May), even those districts that are prone to   seem to have managed to avert the crisis this year. In the backdrop of the meteorological department’s prediction of a normal monsoon this year, ‘good water levels’ bring relief. 
  
  
 According to state irrigation officials, except for   in Amravati and Nagpur regions of Vidarbha, all reservoirs are in a position to supply water till July 15 as they have 35-40% stock. Water levels in dams in and around Mumbai, Pune, Nashik and in Konkan region are impressively high—40-48% to 55-60%. 
 
 Mumbaikars can especially breathe easy as lakes that supply water to the city, including Bhatsa, Tansa, Vaitarana, and Modak Sagar, have 55-60%   against 41.6% in 2017, 30% in 2016 and 36% in 2015, said BMC sources.
 
 “Even if monsoon gets delayed, the level in dams across the state are sufficient to meet demand to a large extent, provided water is not wasted. Water management activities have already been started in Vidarbha by regulating water consumption in urban areas,” said an expert attached to the state irrigation department.
 
 In 2016, the water stock in dams across Maharashtra, barring Mumbai and Pune region, was around 17% and in 2017, it was 40%. Interestingly, around 76,000 artificial lakes that have been dug up over the last two years as part of the state’s ambitious Jalyukt Shivar (artificial farm lake) campaign have recharged wells in farms, and can cater to the domestic needs of farmers till May. The campaign, said irrigation officials, has improved groundwater levels in wells and borewells, a boon for farmers in dry regions, especially Marathwada. 
 
 The water tanker train that was sent to Latur from Solapur two years ago was a striking image underscoring the severity of water scarcity faced by Marathwada, parts of Vidarbha and northern Maharashtra. 
 
 In April 2016, the water stock in Marathwada was 0.8% against 41.5% in 2017 and 35.4% in 2018. The scenario indicates relief for the state’s driest region this summer. There is 40% water stock level in Manjara dam in Latur this year, said irrigation officials. In 2016, this dam had gone dry forcing the government to send the water train. In 2017, the dam had 60% water stock.
