PANAJI: Town and country planning minister   Sardesai on Saturday refused to back down even in the face of criticism, repeating his statement that some domestic tourists are ‘scum of the earth’. Calling for a review of Goa’s existing tourism policy, he said that Goa should discourage budget domestic tourists and aim to bring in high-spending tourists who contribute to the state’s economy.

 “There is a small section of the 6.5 million tourists in Goa that have created the biggest nuisance,”   said. “These people have no civic sense and they are the ones who are creating maximum garbage and maximum nuisance in Goa.” 
 
 The minister, who holds the agriculture portfolio in the Manohar Parrikar-led coalition government, said that he was just voicing out the ‘general feeling’ of locals. “Goa’s model of development is about low-density high-cost, it is not about quantity but about quality. I am speaking for the people of Goa,” Sardesai said.
 
 While Sardesai asserted that he was not xenophobic or against North Indian tourists, he said that he had no intention of apologising for expressing his sentiments.
 
 He said that he didn’t call all the 6.5 million tourists scum of the earth, but only a section of them who create a nuisance in the state. “We should not have such tourists in Goa,” he said. 
 
 Sardesai also said that the influx of tourists into the state has sparked fears that Goans are losing their identity. “Fifty years ago, some people were trying to merge Goa with Maharashtra, but now we are fearful of the scenario where we are gobbled up from within,” Sardesai said.
 
 Sardesai, who is the president of the Goa Forward Party, said that as a regional party, he had to espouse local sentiments.
