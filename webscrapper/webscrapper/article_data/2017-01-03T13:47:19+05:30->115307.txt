Cosy and sophisticated tints in their natural hues are all set to take centre stage this year for home decor, say experts. Design and interior specialist Sonam Gupta says, “2017 seems to strike the right balance with nature. Earthy, dusky colours have been attracting the forecasters who have chosen shadowy hues of green, blue, pink and brown. The warm undertones with hazy overlays in any colour will dominate the home decor scenes in 2017.” Move away from the bright tones of shocking pinks and indigo hues. Natural shades are here to stay. 
Krsna Mehta, interior expert says, “Shades of deep turquoise, khaki and maroons are the colours for walls in 2017.”
 
 The striking, crisp blush of hazelnut with its earthy tints is up and coming this year. Sonam adds, “It has an ordinary, yet rich look and will explicably be seen dominating every industry, right from automobiles to wall shades as well as fabrics.”
 
 Another stunning shade (  is the shade of the year) of green, kale, has been raised to the podium to become the colour of the year for 2017. The raw freshness and exuberance of the colour is contagious and creates an invigorating setting of nature at home. 
 
  
  
 
 Royal blue is here to stay, say experts. Looked upon as a colour depicting reliability and calmness, Niagara, the denim shade has been selected as the spring colour for 2017. The enigmatic and intense Lapis Blue and Island paradise will be playfully adopted in varied sectors this year.
 
 A fiery tinge of flame red and primrose yellow will be seen as flashy shades that form the center of attraction in-between varied earthy palette.
