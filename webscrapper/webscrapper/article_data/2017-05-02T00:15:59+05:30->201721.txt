MUMBAI: In the last decade, 33 women have died due to   or female sterilization operations, shows   obtained under   from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ( ).

 The data shows that four women, including three who were only 30-years-old, died in 2016-17 due to sterilisation operations. “While two were patients from outside Mumbai, families of the two who were from Mumbai got a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each,’’ said the RTI information. 
 
 In 2015-206, BMC recorded 10   of women aged 25-38. In 2013-14, eight women aged 20-40 died in the Greater Mumbai region.
 
 While the RTI data did not have any analysis of what caused the deaths, doctors said there were many reasons, ranging from unpexperienced doctors to unclean operation theatres. Dr Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer of Mumbai, said, “BMC gets tubal ligation deaths at private and public hospitals. There have been cases of laproscopic injuries and surgical complications causing the death of women.’’ She said the selection of patients was most important.
 
 RTI activist Chetan Kothari, who sought the information from BMC, said, “It is unfortunate that women are dying due to tubal ligation, while men are not ready to undergo vasectomy, which is simpler. In fact, there have been deaths reported due to vasectomy,’’ He said male sterilisation was not popular in India due to a misconception that it could be linked to impotency.
 
 Dr Y S Nandanwar, who recently retired from Sion Hospital as head of gynaecology, said, “Vasectomy is a simpler operation. Like any operation, it carries the risk of death due to infection or bleeding, among others.’’ But, he said, there are many non-invasive methods available for family planning. “The focus shouldn’t be on tubectomy but on newer methods of family planning,’’ he said.
