CHENNAI:   rail officials and engineers may have started to test-run locomotives on a 4km underground stretch along  , but public services on the section are unlikely to start anytime soon.

 Chennai Metro Rail Ltd ( ) officials are, however, looking at a deadline of April 2018 to open to the public the stretch from Little Mount and AG-DMS.
 
 A CMRL official said engineers have started to test-run only locomotive on the line between Little Mount and AG-DMS to check the dimensions, track alignment and related technology that they have installed.
 
 Full-fledged trial runs by metro rail rakes trains are likely to begin in October, when engineers will test all installed electrical and signal systems.
 
 “What we are doing with locomotives are not proper trial runs,” the official said. “We will begin internal inspections by operating actual metro trains within three months.”
 
 Though the 4-km line between Little Mount and AG-DMS may be ready much before the remaining 4km of the section from May Day Park to AG-DMS, the initial plan of CMRL officials was to wait and open the entire 8km line at one go. However, officials may soon take a decision whether to wait or open one part of the line under arterial Anna Salai.
 
 “It is too early to say if we will open AG-DMS to Saidapet before the rest of the Anna Salai is ready,” another official said. “We will soon decide and, if we decide to, it will be in the first quarter of 2018.”
 
 Metro rail connects AG-DMS and Saidapet via   and   underground stations. A ramp across the   river will connect Saidapet station and the elevated Little Mount station which is already operational.
 
 “Our plan is to have the entire 45km of phase-1 operational by the end of 2018,” the official said.
 
 A final round of work is still underway at the stations along the underground line between Little Mount and AG-DMS. CMRL has installed its main systems, for tunnel ventilation, heating and air-conditioning and signalling.
