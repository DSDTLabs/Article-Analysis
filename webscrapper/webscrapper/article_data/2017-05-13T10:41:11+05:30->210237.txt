PUNE: The   police on Thursday booked some staff members of a correction home and minor   lodged there for allegedly showing   video   to other minor inmates.

 The incident occurred sometime between 2010 and December 2015.
 
 The incident came into light in October last year when 14 minors from the correction home were shifted to an orphanage at Ambegaon taluka. Secretary of the orphanage Vilas Pandhare noticed a strange behaviour among children who came from Pune. “After counselling, the students narrated the entire incident to me,” Pandhare told TOI.
 
 “The students revealed that when they were in the correction home at Pune, some of the staff members and few minors used to show them obscene clips on the projector meant for e-learning facility. When the students tried to inform the officials, they did not bother to take cognizance of it,” he said.
 
 Pandhare said, the student also told him that staff members and other minors used to beat them up. “All the minors are in the age group of 10 to 15. Some of them alleged that they were sodomised in the correction home,” Pandhare said.
 
 Pandhare said that he immediately informed the woman and child welfare commissioner’s office and other offices in Pune about the incident. “I also lodged a complaint at the Ghodegaon Police Station,” Pandhare said.
 
 As the incident took place in Pune, the case has been transferred to the Shivajinagar police. The suspects have been booked under Sections 377 (unnatural offence), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act.
 
 An officer from the Shivajinagar Police Station said that a case has been registered. “We are trying to find out the staff members and minors who were in the correction home when the incident occurred,” the officer said.
