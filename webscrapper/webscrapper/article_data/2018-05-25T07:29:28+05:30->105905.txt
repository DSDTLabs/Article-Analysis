KOLKATA:   trains are likely to run slightly late next month with the yard remodeling work at Mahanayak Uttam Kumar station from Saturday. Services of KD25 — the Dum Dum-bound train that starts from Tollygunge at 8.50 am daily — will remain suspended till the work is completed.

 
 The scheduled date of completion is July 7. However, there is good news for commuters as well. After the work is completed, trains will run faster as a vital crossover will be shifted to another location.
 
 “There is a speed restriction of 20kmph at the Tollygunge station as there is a crossover at a sharp curve. This crossover will be shifted to a point where the tracks run straight. After work is completed, trains will be able to pass this point at 55kmph. When this happens, trains will gain nearly one-anda-half minutes. The speed restriction was in place ever since services were extended towards  ,”   CPRO   said.
 
 Another important part of the project is insertion of a derailing switch at the Y-siding beyond the Tollygunge station. Once this switch is in place, rakes can be moved simultaneously from the both the Up and Down directions even when one is at the siding. This will also help in reducing the time of reversing rakes and may aid in bringing down frequency at a later date.
 
 “The carshed will remain closed while the work is on. During this period, no rake can be parked there. We will also shut down the third platform at Mahanayak Uttam Kumar during this period. All trains between the   and Rabindra Sarobar stations will also run with paper signals till work is completed. All this is likely to cause trains to run a bit late,” Banerjee added.
