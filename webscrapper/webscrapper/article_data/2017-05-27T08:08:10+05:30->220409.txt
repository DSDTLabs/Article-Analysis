HYDERABAD: In sensitive Jammu & Kashmir where separatists have kept the state on the boil, the peace efforts of Prince  , the great grandson of the last Mughal emperor  , seems to have yielded some results.

 With the Centre’s backing, Hyderabadi   toured Jammu and Kashmir and briefed governor N N Vohra about the sentiments of the people. The meeting took place on May 24. He informed the governor that a Madrasa Board should be constituted in J&K and that more avenues of employment should be made available to the people. The governor reportedly urged Prince Tucy to continue with his efforts for peace in the valley.
 
 “Politicians in general seem to have lost the trust of the people. They want love. They want to be cared for. There were complaints that politicians come only during elections and do not bother about them later,” Prince Tucy told TOI from J&K.
 
 In Hyderabad, Prince Tucy does not engage in any political activity but carries out social service activities. He lives near DRDL. He said with the backing of the PMO, he undertook a tour of Jammu and Kashmir and spoke to the people. “Separatists should not be allowed to play a role in India’s Kashmir. This is the reason why I understood the mission to Kashmir. People want employment opportunities,” Prince Tucy said.
 
 Prince Tucy spoke at gatherings in   and Rajouri – places which are highly sensitive. He had meetings with district police officials and also Islamic scholars apart from addressing a press conference where he urged the people of Kashmir not to encourage separatists.
