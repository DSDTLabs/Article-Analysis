Ye Hai Mohabbatein's   aka Raman Bhalla has become a hard core gym freak now and doesn't skip his workouts.
 
  The actor has worked really hard and shed kilos to sport a muscular physique.
  
  Karan recently posted a picture of himself of how he looked before and now and you will be surely impressed.
  
  
 
  
 
  
  He captioned the picture saying "Hardly working ... to ... working hard ..! Thanks to @rocky_bodytransformer my trainer and @alygoni my brother ...!!
  
  
  
  
  Karan, who would avoid being shirtless earlier, has started forgetting about wearing a tee when he steps out in the open, thanks to his industry colleague and co-actor  . If it wans't for his on screen brotherl, Karan would have not been able to get inspired for a physique like what he has now.
  
  We are not only surprised by this transformation of his, but are also looking forward to him being an inspiration to many out there.
