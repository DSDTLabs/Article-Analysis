GUWAHATI: A public meet was organized by the North   Zone, which covers Assam's Brahmaputra Valley,   and Meghalaya. 

 Assam chief minister   and several ministers from the state, heads of different sattras and tribal kings attended the congregation. The RSS chief said the congregation was not a show of strength but an attempt to make people see that "the essence of India is Hindutva". 
 
 He added, "India needs to be strong not to capture new lands, but to win the hearts of people."
