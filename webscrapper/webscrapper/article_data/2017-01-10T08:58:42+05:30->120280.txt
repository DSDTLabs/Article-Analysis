JODHPUR: Twenty-four hours after the   that claimed one person and left three injured on Sunday midnight, Jodhpur police have still no clues to track culprits. The victim and the injured were all homeless and were sleeping on a pavement near Big Bazaar. 

 According to Sardarpura police, one Shamsher Singh, a ‘sadhu’ in appearance, had come to Jodhpur with his hearing-impaired son from Bharatpur on Sunday. Both of them were sleeping on a footpath near   with two others.
 
 “At about midnight, a speeding four-wheeler went out of control and ran over these sleeping people and hit the wall beyond.   died on the spot while three others, including his son, suffered severe injuries,” said  .
 
 People in the car, however, managed to escape from the spot with the damaged vehicle. The accident was recorded by a CCTV camera.
 
 “We are trying to identify the vehicle through the footage. But it’s not clear and we are finding it difficult to read the registration number of the vehicle,” Singh said.
 
 Meanwhile, all the three injured were stated to be out of danger. This was the second such incident happening in the city. Before this, a truck had crushed two daily wagers to death and injured four others about seven years back.
