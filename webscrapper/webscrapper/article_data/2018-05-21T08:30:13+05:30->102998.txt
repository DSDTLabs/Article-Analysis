PATIALA: Education officers in some districts have directed PSEB   to continue with the controversial Class XII history book of last year as the education board is yet to finalize revised syllabus of the subject. 

 The previous history book had angered Sikh bodies, who called the content as objectionable and distorted. The matter came to light after the state government published the book for this year recently and its content sparked outrage.
 
 PSEB chairperson Manohar Kant said no decision had taken on the implementation of old history books so far. “Soon, few chapters of history will be provided to students on the internet, so that they are able to learn during vacation. In this time, the committee will get time to go through the content of the new book,” he said.
 
 When contacted, Ropar district education officer (secondary)   said they were continuing with history books of last year as they were approved by the PSEB. “The new books could take up to a month or two. By then, students will be at the receiving end. So, in coordination with PSEB members in Chandigarh, we asked teachers to teach from old books of history in schools,” he said.
 
 When asked if he was aware of these books too landing in controversy over “objectionable” content, he answered in the affirmative, but said he had no option.
 
 Sangrur DEO (secondary)   said she was unaware if history was beig taught from old books. “Headmasters in schools could be teaching from these books as students need to be taught something,” she said.
 
 Students of Class XII are facing a hard time because of unavailability of the history book, after the government banned it this year. Students will appear for class tests in July and September.
