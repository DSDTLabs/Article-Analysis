Surat: There is some good news for air travellers. Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will launch the BRTS bus services from airport to the ONGC terminal starting from Wednesday. 

 In February this year the airport authorities had requested the civic body to extend the BRTS service to the airport in order to facilitate the passengers alighting on the airport from other states and cities.
 
 The civic body is running the BRTS from Udhna-Magdalla and Pilod till TGB hotel on Dumas road. Recently, the civic body has introduced direct city buses from Chowk Bazaar to Dumas as well. 
 
 Sources said that private cabs have been charging hefty fares from the passengers arriving at the airport due to the absence of public transportation system. The passengers have to pay Rs 600 for one-way transfer from airport to different parts of the city. 
 
 The BRTS bus service to airport will be inaugurated by mayor Ashmita Shiroya in the presence of airport officials on Wednesday.
 
 Airport transfers is the biggest problem for passengers. There are very few cabs outside the airport and they too charge exorbitantly. The BRTS service will go a long way in facilitating the passengers, especially outstation passengers to travel to the nearest destination in the city and catch an auto towards their final destination.
 
 Member of We Work for Working Airport at Surat (WWWAS) Sanjay Jain said, “This is good news for many passengers finding it difficult to find transportation at the airport. We have seen many passengers arriving at the airport walking out of the premises to catch an auto or a cab. The auto drivers were looting the passengers.”
