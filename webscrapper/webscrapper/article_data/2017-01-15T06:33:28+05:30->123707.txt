 He said the government should take action against the   for “irresponsible” statement. Meanwhile, a group of activists first hurled slogans against the BJP minister at the bus stand here and later blackened his posters pasted on the wall. 
 
 Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who was at Kashreti village on Saturday, condemned Vij’s statement. Hooda said the BJP minister did not understand the importance of freedom fighters since he had not participated in any such struggle during his lifetime.
