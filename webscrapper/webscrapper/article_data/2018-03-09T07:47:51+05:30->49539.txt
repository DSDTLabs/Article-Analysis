CHANDIGARH: A spot located in Sector 38 (west) near   has been bearing the brunt of lack of a dumpster and has turned into a an open dumping zone with mountains of debris and   scattered all around. 

 “Sir, this place was once completely empty. There was no filth, garbage or debris here. But eventually with time, a lot of people started throwing garbage here, due to the absence of dumpsters nearby. A lot of construction labourers, who work at various construction sites in Sector 38 (west) and Dadumajra, now come and dump all debris in the open ground and have not even been pulled up about it so far,” said  , a Sector 38 (west) resident.
 
 The presence of garbage and debris in the locality has also paved way for stray animals to come and inhabit this side of the ground, who can be often seen feeding on it, thus ending up scattering the same at different locations. They are also creating a problem for numerous passerby living in   Colony, who are now nervous about encountering stray animals on their way.
 
 The ground, that was once used by the local children for playing cricket and other outdoor sports, has now been reduced to a makeshift dumping ground which has contributed to the city’s pollution immensely. 
 
 However, despite repeated attempts, the concerned   officials could not be reached for comments on the same.
