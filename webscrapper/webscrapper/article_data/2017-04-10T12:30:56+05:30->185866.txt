NAGPUR: Five-year-old Varad Malkhandale, loves playing and asking questions just like any other peppy kid his age. His inquisitiveness and his memory has helped him bag four national level awards by   (WRI). He was conferred the awards by Vaishali Kodhe, adjudicator of WRI, at his alma mater Narayana Vidyalayam, Somalwada, on Sunday morning. He is a KG student.

 This tiny tot ‘Memory Master’ is the youngest to recite ABCD in reverse order, within 3.39 seconds. He has correctly identified 107 car models belonging to 22 car companies in 1 minute and 9 seconds. Give him the map of India and he will identify all 29 states of India and even arrange miniature maps of these states to form the map of country. He has a record of doing the former in 39 seconds and the latter in a matter of 2 minutes and 12 seconds. He demonstrated these in front of the audience at the event.
 
 He has not undergone any special training for these skills, and is determined to become a doctor. Besides this, he knows many Sanskrit shlokas, Ganesh stotra, national anthem, national song and its likes.
 
 “He does his homework in crèche itself and loves studies as well as playing. People find it difficult to fathom this and are initially even reluctant to believe. World Records India conducted three video tests and two online live tests by its judges, including their president  . Then they told us that Varad had qualified for the record,” said his father Bhushan Malkhandale, a government employee. His mother, Ujwala, is a professor at  .
 
 He had created three records last year, of which he bettered the record of identifying car models. The other records include ‘Youngest to recall spellings in a minute’ and ‘reverse counting from 100 to 0’. These records were for India Book of Records.
 
 Varad had acquired necessary skills for these records much earlier but much time was lost in convincing WRI authorities, added his father.
