BHUBANESHWAR:   chief minister   on Thursday named Biju Janata Dal spokesperson   as his nominee to the Rajya Sabha.
 
  On Thursday, Patnaik also named ex-finance minister Pradip Kumar Amat as speaker of the state assembly. The RS seat had been vacated in March when Patnaik had recalled senior   leader   mid-way through his term.
  
  Das had resigned to become chairman of the state planning board and convener of party’s SC cell.
  
  Considered a committed BJD politician, Deb should help check the influence of certain BJD parliamentarians, who have been rather outspoken about their increasing disenchantment with their party.
  
  The 45 year old Deb, has been a three time MLA (2000-2014) from his home town of Aul in Kendrapada, from where his father late Sarat Kumar Deb also contested successful, first with the Swatantra Party and then Janata Party in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
  
  The younger Deb has served as minister in Patnaik’s government twice. In 2014, he lost to Congress leader Devendra Sharma and was currently serving as the party’s spokesperson and as chairman of the Odisha State Housing Board Corporation.
  
  “I thank chief minister for nominating me for Rajya Sabha. I will raise Odisha’s concern and demands in Delhi and work towards protecting state’s interest,” Deb said. The RS election is due on May 25 and BJD with 117 of the 147 seats is unlikely to face any competition.
