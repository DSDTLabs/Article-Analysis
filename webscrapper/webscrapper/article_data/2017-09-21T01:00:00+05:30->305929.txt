It was a Sunday abuzz with great activity in   when over 150 people gathered at the Tilwada village of   to participate in a 3.5km Clean   River Walk undertaken by   MLA  . The walk began from Tilwada village in Jewar and ended at Momnathal village in Dadri. The participants also planted more than 500 saplings at the point where Yamuna and Hindon river meet.

  Dhirendra Singh said, "This was a clean river some years back but now it is in a sorry state, thanks to all the pollution. The aim of the walk is to raise awareness among people to save this slowly dying river. Also, today I want to urge people to not bring plastic bottles here or just throw them carelessly in the river. This causes pollution and harms the river."

  Sumita Vaid Dixit, a member of Active Citizen Team, said, "The presence of heavy metals such as chromium, ferrous, and zinc in Hindon is proof that untreated industrial waste is still being discharged into the river. Hindon flows through Greater Noida and the biggest worry is that the pollutants in the river have reached the groundwater, which is the only source of drinking water for Greater Noida residents. Neither water purifiers nor ROs installed in our kitchens can remove heavy metals from our water. This means that our drinking water can be contaminated and this poses a huge risk to our health. Plantation will reduce the pollution levels of the river and help in reviving the dying river." She added, "The objective of todayâ€™s walk is to make people aware that a river, which flows right through the heart of Greater Noida, has now become the cause of many diseases."
