VADODARA: The   (VMC) issued chargesheets to its additional city engineer F J Charpot and eight deputy engineers allegedly involved in the   that came to light in its housing schemes. 

 The chargesheets were issued after Charpotâ€™s reply to a notice issued to him was not found unconvincing.
 
 VMC has spent overspent an amount of more than Rs 58crore without necessary concurrence from the standing committee of the civic body. Charpot was issued the notice after the irregularities had come to light regarding the phase three of the housing blocks that have come up under the   for the   (BSUP) scheme under the   (JnNURM) and the Rajiv Aavas Yojana (RAY).
 
 The specifications of amenities provided under the scheme were changed and additional work was done only with an in principle approval from the municipal commissioner. No final nod for making the expenses was taken.
 
 VMC officials said that against an original tender of Rs 104crore in the BSUP projects, the project cost went up to Rs 138crore as the contractor could not begin work in time and another agency had to be given the work. But with alterations an additional expense of Rs 58 crore was incurred taking the total project cost to Rs 196crore.
 
 In the RAY schemes it had come to light that the pile foundations made for the project were beyond specifications and had led to extremely high costs. 
 
 While the difference is yet to be worked out, it is expected to increase the costs of houses significantly and the beneficiaries may not be able to bear it.
