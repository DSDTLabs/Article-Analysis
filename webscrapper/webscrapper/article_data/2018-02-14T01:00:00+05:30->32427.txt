There are slice-of-life films and light-hearted romances. And then, there are intense love stories that stay with you — with unspoken feelings — long after you have left the theatre. Shoojit Sircar’s next, 'October — A Story Of Love', promises to belong to the latter category. The movie, touted to be an unusual love tale, stars   and newcomer   in lead roles. BT brings you a new look of Varun from the film, which will show him in a different avatar. As the world celebrates Valentine’s Day today, the makers are also releasing a video, which offers a glimpse of the world of 'October', online.
