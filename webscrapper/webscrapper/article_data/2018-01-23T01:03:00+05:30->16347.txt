Jodhpur: In a major relief to higher education minister Kiran Maheshwari, the high court on Monday ordered to quash an FIR lodged against her after the assembly elections for alleged tampering with information in her nomination papers.

 Arguments in the petition by Maheshwari had been completed during winter vacation and the order had been kept reserved.
 
 “Today, Justice Sandeep Mehta, while pronouncing order, quashed the FIR against the minister,” said her counsel Sachin Acharya.
 
 One Jitendra Khateek had filed a complaint against Maheshwari accusing her of providing false information in her nomination papers using fake documents. 
 
 On his complaint, Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM), Rajsamand, ordered police to file an FIR and begin investigation.
 
 But Maheshwari challenged this decision in the district and sessions court, which also upholding the decision of the CJM, ordered Raj Nagar police to file the FIR and rejected Maheshwari’s plea for quashing the FIR.
 
 “Maheshwari finally moved the HC praying quashing the FIR through an application under Section 482 of CrPC and hearing the arguments Justice P S Bhati ordered an interim stay on the FIR,” Acharya said.
 
 The arguments were completed during winter vacation and Justice Mehta had kept the order reserved.
