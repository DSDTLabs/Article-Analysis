The budget has proposed to revise the stamp duty rates of property transaction between family members from the maximum Rs 1,000 at present to 0.2% or Rs 1,000, whichever is higher, with an aim to target large transactions. The new proposal will charge a higher stamp duty in all transaction types (gift, settlement, partition and release) between family members that are valued at more than Rs five lakh.

 The land deals among family members at present attracts only a maximum of Rs 1,000 as stamp duty. Though there was a maximum cap on the registration fee, which was Rs 25,000, the last budget had done away with the capping. The   government in 2011 had brought down the stamp duty for the family members from 2% (for gift and settlement) and 1% (for partition and release) of the fair value of the land to a maximum of Rs 1,000. The budget estimates that considering the devaluation of rupee, the stamp duty is irrational, and proposed the change. Only a nominal revenue of Rs 25 crore per year is expected through this revision.
 
 
 
  
 
 The budget has also proposed to hike the fair value of land by 10%, which will be the first increase after 2014, when it was increased by 50%. The base value that was used for the increase in 2014 was that of figures that were published in 2010, which again was calculated on the basis of 2006 data. But   sources said that even the latest   in the budget will be unable to reduce the  , and the market value, which has tremendously increased in the last decade. The market value is usually considered double that of fair value. The budget proposed to restore the land tax that was reversed by the last UDF government in 2015, after revision in 2014.
