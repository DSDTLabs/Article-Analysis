CHENNAI: The police on Wednesday arrested a Chennai-based businessman and his friend after a Thai woman complained that they sexually assaulted and cheated her. 

  Naruemon Japai, 26, sent a complaint to the Prime Minister’s office in New Delhi via the Thai   seeking action against Jain, 43, and Vikas Kothari, 42, of Sowcarpet. Japai’s communication was forwarded to the Chennai police commissioner’s office. 
 
 Japai, who sells garments at a small shop in Bangkok, said she met Jain at a pub in Bangkok in 2011 during one of his visits there. She claimed that Jain   her drinks and sexually assaulted her. Later, he maintained a relationship with her after promising marriage and the couple travelled to China and several other countries. She later gave birth to a boy and a girl who live with her, Japai said.
 
 Japai said Jain took her to a registrar’s office in Bangkok to formalise their marriage. He was accompanied by his friends Santhosh and Kothari, who runs a business supplying chemicals to pharmaceutical companies. Japai said she realised later that Santhosh signed the marriage certificate as the groom. 
 
 Later, Japai approached a Thai court and divorced Santhosh in 2017. In her complaint, Japai mentioned that Kothari had also attempted to sexually assault her in her apartment.
 
 Additional deputy commissioner of police C Shyamala Devi of the Investigation Unit of Crimes Against Women questioned Jain and Kothari at the Chennai city commissioner’s office before they were arrested. They will be remanded in prison after being produced before a magistrate court in Allikulam on Thursday.
 
 Since Japai claimed that Jain is the father of her children, the police plan to subject the two to DNA tests along with the two children. The city police have also launched a hunt for Santhosh.
