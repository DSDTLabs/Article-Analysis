NEW DELHI: A ‘strange’ liquid substance which had leaked out from a consignment arriving from Brussels by a   flight created panic at   airport on Tuesday, with security agencies called in by CISF. 

 The substance — declared non-hazardous at first — was later found to be paint, officials said. At around 6am on Tuesday, a liquid substance was detected by the ground staff, which had reportedly leaked from a consignment that had arrived from Brussels.
 
 The security teams were alerted immediately, with the   and Disposal Squad, the Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting team and the   all rushing to the spot. The substance was declared non-hazardous after a drill. “After checking, the substance was found to be paint and was segregated from the location. It had leaked out while the consignment — which was bound for Chennai —was being transported,” said aCISF official.
