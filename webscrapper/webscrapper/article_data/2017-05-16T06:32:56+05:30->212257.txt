 In an official release issued from Rohtak, police officials maintained that the first entry was made on the basis of a local's statement. The witness who spotted the body had told police that when they saw the corpse, it was being mauled by stray dogs, who had, by then, eaten up a part of the face and lower abdomen. 
 
 Sources, however, said that the cops should not have got the gender wrong, and been more careful given the sensitivity associated with cases of rape and murder.
 
 “This was simply a clerical mistake made in a hurry,“ said Rohtak SP Pankaj Nain. 
 
 “This is not intentional. The officer used the standard language used for shifting unidentified bodies to the mortuary,“ he added. Haryana DGP B S Sandhu said, “We have changed many things after this case. Now, a DSP will visit the spot in cases related to heinous crimes or suspicious deaths.
