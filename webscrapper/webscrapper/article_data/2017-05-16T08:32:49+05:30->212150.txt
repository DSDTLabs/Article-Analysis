 Police said a Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) outlet on a main road in the locality had closed on April 1, when the December 15, 2016 order of the Supreme Court banning liquor shops on or within 500 metres of highways came into effect.   officials allowed the outlet to reopen in another complex, angering residents of the neighbourhood.
 
 “Residents had earlier protested against the liquor shop relocation,” a police officer said. “More than 150 residents and members of a political party started shouting slogans outside the shop on Monday evening.”
 
 As their fury increased, some of the protesters chased away the supervisor of the outlet, Jayakumar, and two salesmen, Mahendran and Ramesh, on threat of physical violence.
 
 Some of the protesters vandalised the shop while others blocked vehicles on the Trichy-Chennai state highway around 300m away for nearly two hours.
 
 “We cautioned Tasmac officials not to relocate to this site because it I a residential area and it has a lot of schoolchildren,” said one protester, who was unwilling to identify himself.
 
 The protesters forced their way into a drinking section attached to the outlet, grabbed glasses of liquor from tipplers and threw them away. They ransacked the bar, breaking bottles, chairs and tables, before setting fire to the shop.
 
 Fire and rescue services personnel arrived at the the spot and doused the blaze.
