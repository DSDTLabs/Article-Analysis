Who says travelling off-shores is easy for actors.   is a case in point. During the two-month-long schedule of ' ' in Europe, her team lost its make-up and hair kits in Amsterdam. It all happened when the actress and her team decided to dine out at a local restaurant in the city. After returning to the hotel they were put up at, Anushkaâ€™s team realised that the kits had gone missing. When enquired, the driver of their van confessed that he had forgotten to lock its doors, and the bags were probably stolen. The team was worried because they had a continuity to maintain at the shoot the following morning. While her team toyed with the idea of heading to a shop early morning, Anushka decided to borrow a few things from the crew and use some of her own make-up and hair-styling items for the day to ensure the shoot starts on time. Post pack-up, she headed to the market with her team and bought make-up and hair kits for them which helped them sail through the rest of the schedule.
