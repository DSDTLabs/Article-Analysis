NAGPUR: If you lose a certificate provided by the state government, then the government staffers will no longer have to complete the formalities once again for reissuing it. The certificate issued to you will be saved in a digital   and reissued to you immediately.

 The state government has also taken several steps to simplify the process to issue certificates for caste, income, domicile, nationality, OBC non-creamy layer etc said Swadhin  , chief rights to services commissioner of the state. He said the commission would take strict action against government staffers who fail to issue documents within the stipulated time period.
 
 Addressing a press conference on Friday, Kshatriya said that earlier the caste certificate file had to pass through five tables. “We have simplified the process and now it needs to move through only three tables. Deliberations are on to make the process even simpler,” he added.
 
 Nagpur district administration is issuing 7/12 land extract online. “From August 1, we will introduce this facility in all districts of Nagpur revenue division,” said divisional commissioner Anup Kumar.
 
 More than 400 services have been included under Right to Services Act. However, only a few departments like revenue, urban development, rural development, etc. are following the Act, said Kshatriya. “We will carry out an awareness drive at gram panchayat level to ensure that all departments follow the Act. I have directed all district collectors to hold workshops on the Act,” he said.
 
 When pointed out that even if a man has a caste certificate his son or daughter also need to seek caste certificate, the commissioner said that the law needs to be changed for this.
