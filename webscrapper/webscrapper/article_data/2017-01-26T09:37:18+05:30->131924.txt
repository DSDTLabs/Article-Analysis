BENGALURU: Chief minister   had predicted a Rs 3,000 crore loss to the state exchequer after the   shocker on November 8, 2016. However, revenue-generating departments have performed well in the past couple of months, with sales tax collection showing a 21.24% year-on-year increase in November.

 “It was estimated that demonetization would have a deep negative impact on revenue collection. However, official figures belie the fears. The collection has exceeded the budget expectations,” said a senior official from the finance department.
 
 Contrary to the anticipation that sales tax collection, a major source of revenue, would bear the brunt of the impact, the commercial taxes department has been among the high performers. In November 2106, the department racked up Rs 4,521 crore through Value Added Tax (VAT), 21.24% higher than the November 2015 figure. The   in October 2016 stood at Rs 4,176.16 crore.
 
 The first three weeks of January, VAT fetched the department Rs 4,516.58 crore as against Rs 4,194.93 crore collected during the enitre month of January in 2016. For December 2016, the figure was Rs 4,252.29 crore, representing a 16.24% year-on-year growth.
 
 With the sales tax collection target for 2016-17 was set at Rs 51,338 crore, the commercial taxes department collected Rs 43,228.58 crore till January 24, 2017. Experts expect a much better performance in February and March as the fiscal year ends.
 
 “Usually, revenue collection peaks in the last quarter of any fiscal year. Sales tax revenue should exceed the budget estimation,” said BT Manohar, taxation committee chairman,   and Industry (FKCCI).
 
 The excise department, which had set a target of Rs 1,400 crore for November 2016, mobilized Rs 1,392.83 crore in revenue, a 15.89% increase from the previous year. As against the annual target of Rs 16,510 crore, the department collected Rs 12,121.89 crore till December 31, 2016.
 
  (MVT) revenue stood at Rs 3,781.45 crore (till December 31, 2016); the annual target was Rs 5,160 crore. However, the revenue from property registration dipped, with the monthly average standing at Rs 656 crore as against the expected Rs 750 crore. 
 
 Box: Experts credit it to fuel price hike
 
 Trade analysts attribute the positive growth in VAT collection to the increase in petrol and diesel prices — fuel prices were hiked thrice after demonetization and since taxation is ad valorem, the increase has resulted in a windfall for the exchequer. Better compliance among traders is another reason for the spurt in tax collection. Government officials seem to agree with the analysts.
 
 “We are still analyzing the situation while the revenue figures are being assessed. We think the hike in fuel prices may have helped. However, we are happy that revenue collection hasn’t been affected to the extent we feared despite demonetization and drought,” said ISN Prasad, additional chief secretary, finance department. Officials from the finance and commercial taxes departments will meet on Saturday to take stock of the revenue collection.
 
 “Sales tax revenue is real-time indicator of the cash flow. The revenue fall in the stamps and registration department is a reflection of the slowdown in real estate market, which began much before demonetization. The note ban has only added to the dip,” said RG Muralidhar, a domain expert in indirect taxes.
