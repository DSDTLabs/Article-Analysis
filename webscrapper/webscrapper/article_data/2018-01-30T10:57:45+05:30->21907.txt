CHENNAI: Deputy chief minister O   on Monday lashed out at DMK working president   for criticising government policies. OPS used a government function platform to flay Stalin (without naming him), likening him to a loner who was in the habit of criticising everyone and finally turning “crazy”.

 The deputy CM spoke at a function to lay the foundation stone for the much-delayed   thermal project. The power project originally announced during DMK regime is expected to generate 1320MW during 2021-22. 
 
 “When Amma (former chief minister  ) assumed office in 2011, the state was facing acute power cuts. All that changed after she took over,” said Panneerselvam. 
 
 OPS then narrated a story about a person called Thimmappan. “Thimmappan criticised people in the village who stopped talking to him. He then turned on his parents and they left him and stayed with another son. Thimmappan troubled his wife and children and they left him too. Left alone, Thimmappan turned crazy and began to look at his own image in the mirror and criticised that too,” said Panneerselvam.
