CHENNAI: A couple of days after coach   got the boot,   brought down the axe on their assistant coach   as well.   coach   will replace the Australian and serve as the deputy to their newly-appointed coach  .

 A source, on conditions of anonymity, said that Oakley had refused to work with Soundara Rajan and had questioned the coach’s work ethic. “He took up the job upon the invitation of Robin and was very upset after Robin was sacked. But he took it on the chin and tried to adjust to the means of Soundara Rajan. However, he found the going difficult. He vehemently criticised the training methods of the coach and voiced his discomfort to the team management, following which the owners decided to relieve him of his duties,” the source said.
 
 Oakley, who will be leaving for Bangkok on Friday night, said that he has no qualms with the team management. “I have nothing against anyone and I do not wish to retort to any accusations that I criticised the new coach. I enjoyed my time here. The players have the right attitude and are serious about their fitness. It was fun working with them. I wish everyone all the best,” Oakley told TOI on Thursday.
 
 Another source, close to the developments, informed that Soundara Rajan’s training methods brought about Oakley’s tirade. “Soundara Rajan prefers to train his players in his own way. He believes he can strategise as well as supervise the training. In fact, he gave a new set of practice drills in his first training session on Thursday. Oakley was very disappointed with this intervention. He also felt that there was a big communication gap already between the two. So he accepted the decision,” the source said.
