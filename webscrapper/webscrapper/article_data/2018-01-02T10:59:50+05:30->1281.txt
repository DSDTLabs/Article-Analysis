NEW DELHI: The   would consult a larger opposition before finalising its stand on the contentious bill which proposed to ban instant   and make the practice a cognisable offence, party sources said.

 The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, which has already been passed in the Lok Sabha last week, is likely to be taken up in the Rajya Sabha this week.
 
 According to the sources, leader of opposition in the   Ghulam Nabi Azad has convened a meeting of the leaders of his party (the Congress) as well as other parties in his   chamber on Tuesday, before the bill is taken up.
 
 The sources added that while the Congress was in favour of the bill as it proposed to ban instant triple talaq, whether it would press for sending it to the select committee, as has been the practice in the Rajya Sabha, would only be seen when the bill is tabled in the Upper House.
 
 The party might press for amendments in the bill, including a clause for maintenance to the Muslim women and making it mandatory for the man to prove that triple talaq had not been invoked, the sources said.
