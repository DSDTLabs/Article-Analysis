AHMEDABAD: A member of the Pradesh Election Committee of   Congress, Sagar Raiyka, has resigned from the committee alleging corruption in the party. Rayka’s resignation comes at a time when observers from Delhi are in the city meeting state   leaders.

  told TOI that he did not want to be part of the team that was promoting corruption at the panchayat level. 
 
 "Hence I decided to quit the  . I am a Congress worker and will stay with Congress workers. I can quit politics but cannot quit the Congress," Rayka said.
 
 Rayka has been with the Congress for 42 years. He alleged that he had seen rampant corruption in the panchayats and had pointed it out to the party high command and leaders in Gujarat. 
 
 "But the party’s office-bearers in the state refused to hear to my plea," Rayka alleged. "I had pointed out that the chairmen of the panchayats were indulging in huge corruption and that this was being overlooked." 
 
 Rayka further said that during the panchayat polls, the party had won the elections not because people wanted to vote for the Congress but because it got the Patidar sympathy votes. 
 
 "Even state party president Bharat Solanki has been going on making appointments without consulting senior party leaders or the committee. Some of these appointments were bypassing the constitution of the Congress party," Rayka said. 
 
 He said that he will not follow in the footsteps of former leader of opposition Shankersinh Vaghela. "But I will fight staying in the party," Rayka said.
 
 Rayka is not the first Congressman to speak out against the state party president Bharat Solanki. In the past Vaghela, along with several  , had also resigned from the party criticising the state leadership.
