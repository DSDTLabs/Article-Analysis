Jaipur: Paralegal volunteers have to work as ‘karmayogis’ to facilitate delivery of justice to the poor and the downtrodden, said Rajasthan High Court judge and chairman of the state legal services authority, Justice K S Jhaveri.

 He inaugurated the two-day workshop for paralegal volunteers working with Rajasthan Legal Services Authority at the Agriculture Management Institute in Durgapura on Saturday.
 
 He said there are about 3,000 volunteers working in Rajasthan and gave them the mantra of ‘connect and act’.
 
 There is a big gap between the need for justice and delivery of justice. The volunteers have to identify needy people and facilitate delivery of speedy justice, Jhaveri added.
 
 Emphasizing the role of paralegal volunteers, S K Jain, secretary, legal services authority, said, many people are deprived of justice in the absence of financial resources and information, here paralegal volunteers come into the picture.
 
 A handbook for paralegal volunteers was also released on the occasion.
