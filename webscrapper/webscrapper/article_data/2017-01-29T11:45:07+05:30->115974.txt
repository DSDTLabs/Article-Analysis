Tired of Bollywood stars staying mum about their relationships and adopting the tried-and-tested 'We are just good friends' stance? Well, at least,   is doing it a tad differently. The actress, who wished her fans on New Year's Day with a funny picture along with her alleged beau  , seems to be hinting at her relationship, one post at a time. 

 Interestingly, the rumoured lovebirds have a war of quotes going on between them on Instagram. While Sonam posted a picture with a George Bernard Shaw quote, Anand topped it with a thought-provoking quote from author Seth Godin. The 'Neerja' actress was quick to get the drift and posted a line borrowed from Robin S. Sharma. She wrote, 'Success is not a function of the size of your title but the richness of your contribution. Robin S Sharma'. Anand took the game ahead as he wrote, 'A successful economy is not one in which the poor can buy cars but where the rich use public transportation. @sonamkapoor #QuoteWars'.
 
 It's endearing how Sonam and Anand are all for displaying their affection for each other on social media. Check out their posts here:
