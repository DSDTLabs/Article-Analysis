Vadodara: Diamond ornaments worth Rs 23.5 lakh were stolen from a bungalow in   in posh   area in the wee hours of Tuesday. The owner of the bungalow   reported the incident at Sayajigunj police station following which a case of burglary was registered.

 
 Police said that Daliya and his wife Varsha went off to sleep in their bedroom on the ground floor of their house. But when Varsha woke up around 7 am, she found that the room was locked from outside. On waking Daliya up, the couple called their domestic helper  , who lives in a servant’s quarter in their compound.
 
 Bariya found that the iron grill of one of the rooms was removed and its window was open. He then went inside through the same window and unlocked the door. Daliya did not find an iron safe kept in the worship room. The burglars had shifted the iron safe from the worship room to the room from where they had entered in the house.
 
 A police official said that the safe was not locked and when Daliya opened it, diamond ornaments kept in a secret compartment were missing. Daliya told the police that the ornaments were bought by his wife during their wedding.
 
 During initial probe, police have raised suspicion that the thieves could have visited the house earlier under some pretext since they knew the exact location of safe and nothing else from the house had gone missing. Cops said that there are no CCTV cameras installed by Daliya or any of his neighbours. Ironically, several policemen sit on a bench during night patrolling near Daliya’s house.
 
 Daliya, who was into the business of land dealings, lives a retired life with his wife. The couple’s two sons live separately while their daughter is married off and lives in US.
