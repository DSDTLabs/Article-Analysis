Actor 
  says he doesn't think nepotism exists in the Hindi film industry. 

 The nepotism debate took centre-stage in Bollywood after actress 
  kicked off a controversy recently with her remarks on filmmaker 
  on his talk show.
 
 Karan hit back at Kangana, saying that he did not know what Kangana meant by 'nepotism' as he has not worked with his family members, and instead launched several actors and directors, who hail from non-film background. 
 
 When asked if nepotism exists in the film industry,   says, "I don't think. I don't want to talk much about it." 
 
 The 28-year-old actor, however, praises Kangana, saying, "I like Kangana, her style and more power to her." 
 
 Though Varun was not launched by his father, director David Dhawan, his big ticket break by Karan's Dharma Productions in 'Student of The Year' provided a big launchpad. 
 
 He consolidated his position by delivering hits like 'Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania', 'Main Tera Hero' and critically acclaimed 'Badlapur'.
