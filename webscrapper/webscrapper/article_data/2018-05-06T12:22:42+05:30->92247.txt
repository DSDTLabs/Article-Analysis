PANAJI: The state   unit on Saturday asked the government to withdraw the "highly objectionable" proposal restricting gram sabhas from discussing issues that are not mentioned in the agenda. It claimed that the government's move was intended to stifle voices from villages. 

 "The state government is attempting to silence the voice of the people by resorting to unwanted hyper technicalities, which is not in the spirit of deliberative democracy and the devolution of powers as envisaged under the Panchayat Raj," advocate and   secretary  , said.
 
 The ministry of panchayats had issued a notification on April 12 specifying the draft amendment that the state government planned to introduce in the assembly. The draft amendment states that no subject can be discussed at gram sabhas besides the agenda approved four to seven days prior. The state had given citizens 15 days to provide objections and suggestions.
 
 Gram sabhas across Goa have become a platform to object to government policies, from coal transportation and national waterways, to RP 2021 and PDAs.
