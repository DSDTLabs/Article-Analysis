KOLKATA: CPM may be losing its ground steadily in the   but its students’ arm SFI made a comeback in the   arts faculty union after a two-year hiatus. Other two faculties — science and engineering — however, closed the doors on student organizations of  . Significantly, Trinamool Chhatra Parishad has lost all the five office-bearers’ post. 

 Interestingly, a considerable number of students have opted for NOTA. Around 12% voters in engineering pressed the NOTA button while in arts and science, the figure stood at 10%. In fact, NOTA came second in at least two office-bearer posts — other than the GS — in engineering faculty. A majority of engineering students, as always, went with the Democratic Students’ Front (DSF). However, this faculty saw a rise in the ‘saffron’ vote share. Independent candidate backed by BJP’s student wing ABVP Rohit Jha bagged 646 votes. 
 
 Science students opted for the independents. We The Independents (WTI) — an independent organization — romped home with flying colours. The ripples were felt in the arts faculty with another independent organisation — Forum for Arts Students (FAS) — making a foray into key departments. FAS and others in the Opposition — AISA, DSO — have been more or less able to retain their support base as SFI took advantage of the multi-pronged contest. 
 
 SFI state president Madhuja Sen Roy congratulated JU students for supporting the party when “some people had written the Left off”. “Our victory in JU has come as a boost to our comrades elsewhere in the state where they are fighting against TMCP atrocities. The JU vote is also a rejection of the ABVP/RSS politics,” Sen said. 
 
 Independent candidate Rohit Jha isn’t losing heart. “I got considerable number of votes. We targeted 1,000 votes and could have reached the figure if there was a good turnout of fourth year students,” Jha said.
