Admit it: If you are into working out, you are as much into it for looking good as for feeling good. Getting the glamour muscles (arms and chest) and a six-pack is every   fan’s goal. If what you seek is a washboard tummy, and you are averaging 100   a day and still far from it, rethink your   regimen. New research has shown that working only on your abs will not give you a flatter tummy. You need to get to the ‘core’ of the issue, because without a strong core, a six-pack will remain elusive.

 
 
 Your core encompasses much more than just your abdominals. It includes your hips, lower back and glutes – areas that crunches miss out. Mumbai-based fitness trainer Ali Mirza says reducing fat, along with simple core exercises is the Holy Grail for flat abs. “Cardiovascular exercises are needed to reduce fat cells from your belly,” he says. “Pay attention to your nutrition too. But get a tailored nutrition programme, not just a cookie-cutter diet,” he advises.
