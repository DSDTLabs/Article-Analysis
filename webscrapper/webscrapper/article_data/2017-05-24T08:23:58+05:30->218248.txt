NARSIPATNAM: If roads and buildings minister Ch Ayyanna   has his way,   in   town will soon look like   of Hyderabad. To be developed at a cost of Rs 20 crore, the R&B authorities have chalked out big plans for the tank which include a concrete bund and a beautiful park.

 More importantly, the promenade on the tank bund will be adorned with statues of renowned persons (both local and national). Patrudu said that a detailed plan has already been drawn and the department is in the process of preparing a final blueprint for construction of the bund. 
 
 Narsipatnam, which is scenic and has the best of both rural and urban locales with a major tribal populace inhabiting the area, however, has always remained the lost cousin of   which draws huge tourist traffic from all over the country. 
 
 Locals and public representatives believe the town has lost out all these years in tapping tourism potential.
 
 “That’s the reason why we have decided to refurbish the old irrigation tank Pedda Cheruvu and turn it into a major recreation spot,” Patrudu pointed out and added that the plan to develop the town had never taken off all these years.
