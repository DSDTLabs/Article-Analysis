Khanna: Diamond trader Gaurav Jain (35) and his driver Sukhwinder Singh — both residents of Hoshiarpur —met with a terrible accident in Doraha. Jain was going to Kurukshetra to meet his relatives in his Innova car. When they reached near Doraha canal bridge around 6.30am, a truck in front of them suddenly slammed his brakes, leading the Innova to crash into the truck at high speed. As the car overturned, some passers-by tried to rescue them and also called the police, but after a life-and-death struggle, the two breathed their last within a few minutes.

 According to police sources, Gaurav — the only son of his father Rohtash — has left behind his wife and two minor sons. A few months ago, he had opened a diamond showroom in Hoshiarpur, spending a lot of money to provide all facilities under one roof. On the complaint of Rohtash, Doraha police loged an FIR against the unknown truck driver. Police claimed the culprit would be arrested shortly. After getting the post-mortem done in Civil Hospital Ludhiana, both bodies were handed over to their family members.
