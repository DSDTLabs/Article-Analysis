The minister will monitor the progress of the work every week," said sources. Sitapur district magistrate Sheetal Verma said that dogs have been attacking children in groups of 4-6. The administration is facing difficulty in preventing the attacks because the number of stray dogs is very large and there was no definite place where they could be located, she said.
