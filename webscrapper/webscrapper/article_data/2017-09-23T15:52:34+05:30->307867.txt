‘Jai Lava Kusa’ that presented   in three different avatars showed the difference between the three mostly with costume and behavioural changes. 

 But that was not how it was supposed to be. Way back in February when Jr NTR had signed on the dotted line, there was news that the makers have roped in a prosthetic artist from Hollywood,  , to work on a look for the star. 
 
 Back then it was rumoured that the prosthetic artist who has worked for ‘Lord in the Rings’ would be working on a shocking look for the actor, but now, one can see that no such look has been used in the movie. 
 
 Reports state that while Jr NTR loved the look created for him, the budget and timing did not allow the look to be weaved into the film. While these reports are yet to be clarified, it was expected that Jr NTR would’ve sported a look a la Vikram in ‘I’ and Surya in ‘24’ had things worked out.
