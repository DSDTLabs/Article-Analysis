Publishers are notorious for making knuckleheaded decisions on new titles — the first   book, for instance, was rejected a dozen times — so   has come up with an alternative: Ask readers what they think.

 The 28-year-old software coder and aspiring author in 2015 launched Inkitt GmbH, which gives users access to the works of 60,000 indie authors. That gives Inkitt a wealth of data: whether readers stay up all night devouring a vampire story, how often they put down a mystery and flip over to Facebook, and the number of friends they recommend a title to.
 
 A computer programme sifts through all of that information, then spits out recommendations of stories with hit potential, which Inkitt publishes as e-books, audio books or print titles. “The decision-making by big publishing houses can be very random and they tend to favour established authors,” Albazaz says. “Discovering the next J K Rowling, the next   is what we strive for.”
 
 Albazaz thinks he can help the discovery by tracking over 1,200 ways readers are reading or sharing the story. Inkitt has about 3,00,000 monthly active users, he said.
 
 “It’s about all behaviours around the story,” Albazaz said. “From reading engagement, re-engagement, sharing and the behaviour of new readers who come through their friends.”
 
 Last year Inkitt published about 50 books including ‘Reaper’s Claim’, a romantic thriller by debut author Simone Elise. Albazaz said the title climbed to No. 12 on Amazon’s e-book best-selling list in February 2017.
