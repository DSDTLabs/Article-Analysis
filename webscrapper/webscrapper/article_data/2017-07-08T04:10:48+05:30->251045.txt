GURUGRAM: Around 500 members of the   from Mewat, Alwar and Delhi will participate in a sit-in   at Jantar Mantar on July 18 against lynching. Besides, the organisers expect participation of over a thousand people from across the communities.

 “This issue is no longer restricted to Junaid or Pehlu Khan. The sit-in protest will force the government to take notice of this situation. The moment one spots a Muslim with meat or with a cow, it is assumed they are going to eat beef. Our protests will continue till this mindset is changed and fringe groups are controlled,” said Sher Mohammed, head of Rajasthan’s  .
 
 The sit-in is an extension of the recent protest that was organised at the same venue on July 1 when around 500 Muslims from Haryana and Rajasthan demanded justice for the victims, Pehlu Khan and Junaid.
 
 “This will be a bigger protest at Jantar Mantar because we have asked people from Uttar Pradesh to participate this time. We are living under constant fear that anyone can pose to be a cow vigilante and enter our house to see what we eat. They are killing people over assumptions,” said Firoz Khan, head of Delhi state Meo Sabha.
