NEW DELHI:   has decided to send a team of observers to assess the political situation in  , in what marks an acknowledgement that BJP’s aggression is threatening the party’s position as principal opposition in the state.

 The AICC on Saturday constituted a team of MPs — Tamrdhwaj Sahu and Sushmita Dev and former Union minister Jitendra Singh — to visit the state and submit a report on the ground situation.
 
 The special organisational assignment is unusual given that Congress has remained the main opposition to ruling BJD despite failing to dislodge Naveen Patnaik as chief minister over four terms. While the state has traditionally been politically bipolar,   has been focusing its energy on Odisha in recent months, even posting a good show ahead of Congress in panchayat elections.
 
 Owning up responsibility for the panchayat debacle, AICC general secretary incharge BK Hariprasad had tendered his resignation from the organisational post. 
 
 Now, the party has indicated that Hariprasad’s resignation has been rejected. Also, Congress has appointed former Union minister and senior leader Sushil Kumar Shinde as general secretary in-charge of Himachal Pradesh, to be assisted by MP Ranjeet Ranjan as secretary. The Congress-ruled state goes to polls this year.
