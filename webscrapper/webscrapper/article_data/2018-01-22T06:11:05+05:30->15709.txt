CHENNAI: In what might be yet another setback for bus drivers and conductors,   has cut down incentives based on daily ticket collection by nearly 44%.

 "Despite increase in bus fares, the crew would not enjoy the benefits. This reflects the attitude of the government towards workers' welfare," said   from  .
 
 As per the revised rates, MTC conductors and drivers plying an ordinary service would get only 1.53 for every 100 collected on a daily basis. Those operating express and deluxe buses would get 1.33 and 1.31 per 100. 
 
 The cut in incentives would have an impact on the crowd in buses and accident rates, said experts. 
 
 "The incentive takes a beating if drivers accommodate more students who are given concessions," said M   from  , an NGO. "As a result, drivers do not halt at stops near schools and colleges. This forces students to run after buses and travel on the footboard." 
 
 "It is an unwritten rule that daily incentives will come down every time bus fares are revised. The government is always keen to ensure employees' welfare," said an MTC official. 
 
 "But MTC will have to shell out more from its coffers if it continues to provide incentives at the old rates. This will defeat the purpose of revising fares and clearing pending dues," the official added.
