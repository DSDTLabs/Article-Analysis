BENGALURU: It's   season and once again, Bengalureans have got a chance to pick the fruit directly from farms. The Karnataka State Mango Development and Marketing Corporation Limited will take nearly 300 enthusiasts on a mango tour to farms in   on Sunday.

 Customers can buy mangoes at a wholesale rate if they pick at least 5kgs of them. MD of the corporation   said the tour has seen a good response with nearly 300 citizens enrolling for it on Sundays. “We had hired three buses last year. But more mango lovers have come on board this year, prompting us to hire four buses,“ he said.
 
 Mayor   said, “Citizens usually end up buying fruits sprayed with pesticides. This is a completely organic and safe way to pick mangoes. The tourism programme exposes people to how the fruit is grown. Children are more happy when they are pluck fruits from the tree rather than buying them from the shop.“ Tickets priced at Rs 200 each are available at http:www.ksmdmcl.org.
