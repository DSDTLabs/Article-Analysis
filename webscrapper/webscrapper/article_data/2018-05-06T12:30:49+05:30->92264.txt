BHOPAL: Brace for irregular water supply during peak summer season. Water woes in the city have been compounded by power outage, even though the   (BMC) maintained that water supply is ‘normal’.   officials expect to continue with daily water supply for another three weeks.

 
 But the water crisis is already showing. “We got up early to store water, but only a few buckets later there was a power cut,” said  , a resident of DIG Bungalow.
 
 Shraddha Patnaik, a resident, said: “We are already bearing the searing heat both in the day and night. Things get worse with no electricity and water. Even calling the discom helpline does not help much, as their telephone is constantly busy”.
 
 With residents facing problems, top BMC officials are busy reassuring them that the issue of erratic water supply would be fixed soon. Over the last three days, many parts of the city have experienced disrupted water supply owing to repair of 30-year-old Kolar pipeline. The supply line that connects the Kolar reservoir to the treatment plant is about 7 km long and the filtration plants connect to various parts of the city, the distance of which is an estimated 23 km. A detailed project report is being prepared for laying of new pipeline. BMC estimates that new pipeline would incur a cost of Rs 400 crore.
 
 Ahead of the summer season, BMC officials had anticipated that water connections for   pipeline would cover for shortage of water elsewhere. Bhopal had a less than normal monsoon and 17 of 32 overhead water tanks under Narmada pipeline project are yet to be functional.
