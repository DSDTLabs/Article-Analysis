IDUKKI: The Pembilai Orumai leaders who have been protesting against state electricity minister M M Mani for his allegedly derogatory remarks against them, called off their 20-day agitation on Friday, without achieving any of their demands. But the leaders announced that they would launch a bigger agitation on July 9 at Munnar demanding land for estate workers. 

 KPCC general secretary Lathika Subash, Shanimol Usman and INTUC leader P A   attended the function. "The government has not taken any steps to bring the protest to an end. We will start a big land agitation on July 9 at Munnar and want the government to distribute one acre of land to each family of the estate workers at Munnar. The government should reclaim 80,000 acres of its land held by the Tata group and distribute it to the estate workers at Munnar. We will continue our protest until the government meets our demand," said Pembilai Orumai leader  . Aam Aadmi Party leader   and Adivasi   leader M Geethanandan were also present.
 
  The protest was started following a controversial speech by power minister M M Mani during a public meeting at Kunchithanny Eirupathacare. Mani had alleged that the women who participated in the movement were engaged in drinking and immoral activities during their agitation last year. 
 
 Later, the Orumai leaders had started a hunger protect which was called off after four days.
