KOLHAPUR: The   in the   with the "meagre" hike in   (FRP) of Rs 250 from the current Rs 2,300 to 2,550 per   

 The farmers on Thursday demanded that the FRP should be fixed at a minimum of Rs 3,200 to match the production costs. Sugarcane industry stakeholders, however, banked on stable prices to pay the hike in FRP.
 
 The union government in a cabinet meeting took the decision to increase the FRP from the next crushing season on Wednesday..
 
 Manohar Khot, a farmer from Udgaon taluka in Shirol, said, "The BJP government has disappointed us. They did not hike the FRP for the past two years and has increased it by just Rs 250. Over the years, the production cost of sugarcane crop has been doubled and sugar factories also charge transportation and cutting charges. Therefore, the farmer hardly gets Rs 2400 per tonne. Hence, the government should have increased the FRP by at least Rs 600 per tonne."
 
 Bhagwan Kate, Kolhapur district president of  , said, "The hike is nowhere compared to the rising production costs. We have been consistently fighting for better FRP. We will continue our fight for a better FRP."
 
 Meanwhile, Vijay Autade, executive director of Chhatrapati Shahu cooperative sugar factory, said the government should take policy measures to keep sugar prices stable. "Only then we will able to pay the farmers as per the FRP. If sugar prices fall below Rs 35 per kg, then we need to take loan. We have experienced this situation in 2014-15, 2015-16 seasons."
