Thane: A day after the   and the   snapped their pre-poll pact for  , local leaders of the Congress urged the seniors to extend an olive branch to the NCP and stitch back the alliance.

 Congress leaders in Thane said they have recommended senior leaders to finalise a seat-sharing agreement with NCP considering that the party is losing its grip in the city. The Congress, which won 18 seats in the 2012 civic polls here, crumbled in the last five years with defections and resignations reducing its strength to less than 10 now. 
 
 With Congress election in-charge Narayan Rane visiting Konkan over the weekend, the talks are likely to resume on Monday, leaders said.
 
 However, NCP leader and MLA   said, “There is very little scope for discussion over the seat sharing formula and we are likely to fight the elections alone.”
