 Coming year, the core areas of Jhalana wildlife sanctuary will be equipped with hi-tech wildlife surveillance (WS) and anti-poaching system ( ), a step foresters say will go a long way in curbing poaching activities. 
  
 Till you enter Jhalana Sanctuary, you won't believe that you are actually entering a forest where right from alarm calls to the sighting of a leopard is as thrilling as in any tiger project in India.
 
 
  
  
 
  
 To help the leopards survive and stop those from sneaking into urban areas, two actions are most important. First is hiding places and second is ample prey base. 
  
 Both of these are perfectly available in Jhalana -the tree-dotted hills with caves are the leopards' home, whereas peacocks, languors and blue bulls (nilgais) are in abundance to take care of their feeding.
