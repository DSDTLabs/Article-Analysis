Jaipur: After much delay, the state government has sought prosecution sanction from Centre for senior   official Giriraj Singh from the department of personnel and training (DoP&T). According to sources a request to this effect was sent by the state government a few days to DoP&T, which is the cadre controlling authority of the all India service personnel.

 About five months back the chief minister had given permission to act against the 1985 batch officer under the Prevention of Corruption Act. He was also not considered for promotion to the scale of additional chief secretaries when his batch mates were promoted.
 
 The matter against the officer goes back to 2005 when he was posted as collector at Sirohi. He was accused by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) of misusing his position in a land related case. However, the case was put on back burner as ACB had been waiting for approval from the state government to file chargesheet against the officer.
 
 Finally, about five months back the chief minister gave the approval. The government has been forced to act after the high court sought a report on the officials against whom prosecution sanctions are pending.
