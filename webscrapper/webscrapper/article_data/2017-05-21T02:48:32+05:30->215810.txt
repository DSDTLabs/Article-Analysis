LUCKNOW: A special   court began on Saturday day-to-day hearings in the 1992   demolition case, as ordered last month by the Supreme Court. The apex court has directed that the trial be concluded in two years.

 Five of the six suspects summoned on the first day of the trial — Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, Mahant Ram Vilas Vedanti, Baikunth Lal Sharma alias Prem Ji, Champat Rai Bansal and Dharma Das — were remanded in judicial custody by CBI judge S K Yadav, and subsequently released on bail. The sixth, Dr Satish Pradhan, could not appear before the court.
 
 The hearing will resume on Monday.
