AHMEDABAD:   on Friday disposed of the petition filed by owner of the printing press, Confisec Private Ltd, after   informed the court that it does not intend to seal the press for its investigation in the leakage of question papers of   (BSSC) exam.

 Bihar police wanted original documents in the form of manuscripts of the leaked question papers. The printing press had objected to this on the ground that its parting with the original documents might invite allegations as the documents are confidential. Its advocate, Nandish Thackar, submitted that the printing press can part with the documents under the high courtâ€™s supervision.
 
 The HC asked the company to supply the required documents to the police who will have to make a proper panchnama and issue a receipt for the same.
 
 The company had moved the HC for direction to the state authorities and the Bihar police not to seal its printing facility situated in Naroda. It apprehended sealing following the arrest of the director of the printing press, Vineet Agarwal, by the Patna police on February 25.
 
 The petitioner had sought legal protection against possible sealing of its printing press on the ground that it has a work order of printing 50 to 70 lakh copies of question papers for different recruiting agencies of various states across the country. If the question papers are not supplied in time, it could adversely affect the future of job aspirants.
 
 In this case, the Bihar police began investigation into the   scam after the recovery of leaked question papers from a place within the jurisdiction of   in Patna. The probe led to implication of officials of the commission, including its chairman and 1987-batch IAS officer Sudhir Kumar. Their interrogation further led to the alleged involvement of people from the printing facility in Ahmedabad.
