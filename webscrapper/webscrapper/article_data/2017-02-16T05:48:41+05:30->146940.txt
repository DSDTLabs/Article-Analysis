MANGALURU: A history-sheeter with more than 40 criminal cases against him, was   by a group of unidentified men near a petrol bunk at Kotekar in the wee hours of Wednesday. The miscreants went about meticulously in executing their plan to kill Kalia  , 36, who was out from jail, a few days ago.

 According to sources, a   belonging to Uppala, Rafiq’s native, is said to be behind the crime. Rafiq, who has criminal cases like extortion, murder, theft and others, was on his way to Mangaluru along with others in a car, when he was killed.
 
  The miscreants who were in a mini-lorry rammed his car head on. Sensing the danger, Rafiq started running for his life but was shot at and injured. Later, the miscreants alighted from the lorry and attacked him with lethal weapons killing him on the spot. 
 
 According to police, the incident took place at around 2am and miscreants were following Rafiq from Uppala.
 
 In the attack, one of the aides of Rafiq was also injured and he is being treated at a private hospital. Soon after the incident, Ullal police rushed to the spot.
 
 Goonda Act was invoked against Rafiq in January 2016. According to sources, Noor Ali gang from Uppala is said to be behind the crime which was waiting to settle score with Rafiq. Noor Ali’s brother Muthalib, who was a close aide of Rafiq, had broken out with the gang four years ago and Rafiq eliminated him in 2013 as a result. Noor Ali made a vain bid on Kalia’s life to avenge his brother in the past. Sources added that Noor Ali, who this time executed the plan, killed Rafiq in the same manner the latter had killed Muthalib. Rafiq had rammed Muthalib’s vehicle, shot him and later attacked with lethal weapons. A case has been registered at Ullal police station.
