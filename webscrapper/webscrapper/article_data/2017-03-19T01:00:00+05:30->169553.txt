MUNGER: Munger divisional commissioner Navin Chandra Jha has warned the circle officers and revenue karmacharis of departmental action and even dismissal if at least 75% of the revenue collection target was not met till March 31 this year. 

 The commissioner was reviewing the status of revenue collection from the divisionâ€™s six districts, including Jamui, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura, Khagaria and Begusarai besides Munger, at a meeting of the additional collectors and circle officers here on Friday.
 
 Sources said the commissioner was furious over poor revenue collection in the six districts. While Begusarai reported 36% collection, Lakhisarai 19%, Sheikhpura 12% and Munger reported 50% collection. The other districts could not present any status report.
 
 The commissioner ordered formation of a district task force in each district to monitor revenue collection every week. The DM and SP concerned will head the task force as chief monitoring officers, according to a press note issued on Saturday by the regional deputy director (information and public relations) K K Upadhyaya.
