NEW DELHI: Following the   of students from government and   in the  , the Delhi government has planned to   students of classes III to VIII into groups on the basis of their reading and maths abilities and provide them the assistance they need to increase their learning. The government also wants to help municipal corporations deploy one mentor teacher to every five schools, similar to what the Delhi government schools have.

 During a press briefing on Monday, education minister and deputy chief minister   said that following the results of the survey, the corporations and the Delhi government have decided to segregate the students of classes III to VIII, in both Sarvodaya schools and municipal corporation schools. This is an extension of the Chunauti scheme that was started three years ago by the Delhi government in its schools for Class IX students.
 
 Sisodia said that the students will be made to go through a baseline common assessment to evaluate where they stand, and then segregated into groups of those who can read their books, have difficulty reading their books, and those cannot read anything. “I appeal to the parents of these children who have been identified as weak in their studies to make sure the children attend the extra classes we are planning for them,” he said.
