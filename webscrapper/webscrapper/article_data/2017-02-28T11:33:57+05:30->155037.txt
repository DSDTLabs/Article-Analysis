BALRAMPUR: In his 90s, Chandra Bhal Mani Tiwari was among the first ones to vote at Tulsipur assembly segment in Balrampur district on Monday morning. A resident of  , Tiwari had been two-time Congress MP from Balrampur Lok Sabha in 1971 and 1980. Balrampur, in fact, was the seat from where former prime minister   made his debut in national politics.

 “Vajpayee was elected from Balrampur in 1967. His election symbol was earthen lamp. As he remained away from Balrampur, everybody felt local demands were being neglected. I had grown up in this area and was very popular. Vajpayee was apprehensive of losing elections against me and decided to shift to his hometown Gwalior,” said Tiwari who came dressed in white.
 
 Tiwari started out as village Pradhan in 1949 and graduated to becoming the local sarpanch in 1954, heading a dozen villages. After officiating as sarpanch for a decade, he took up the cause of sugarcane growers in ’60s and was chosen to represent Balrampur by Congress.
 
 “Though we are contemporary, we came from different political ideology and were rivals,” said Tiwari about Atal, adding, “When he became the prime minister I approached him for a job for my son in merchant navy in Kolkata. Vajpayee said he would not be able to help. He forgot Balrampur and people forgot him,” said Tiwari, who prefers to have ‘khade chammach waali chai’ (tea with seven spoons of sugar in which the spoon stands fixed). He is credited with setting up four railway stations in the Gonda-Balrampur belt in 1980s.
 
 An early riser, Tiwari visits his fields and does not suffer from diabetes or blood sugar. “Vajpayee was destined to lead the country and I feel happy for him. Instead of mudslinging, leaders back then treated each other with great respect,” he said. Tiwari said he voted for Congress candidate Zeba Rizwan. In Tulsipur, Samajwadi Party candidate is also in fray and voter turnout was 53%.
