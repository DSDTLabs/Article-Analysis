GURUGRAM:   has become a recurrent issue in various parts of the city with   residents being the latest victims. For the past two days, the residents have been suffering from water shortage owing to a leakage in the pipeline. 

 “For last two days, we have been facing water shortage due to leakage in the main supply pipeline. Residents are left with no option, but to rely on water tankers to meet their daily requirements,” Suraj Sinha, a resident of Sector 46, said, adding that the authorities have assured to restore the supply as soon as possible. 
 
 Infrastructure development work across the city has resulted in disruption in water supply in many sectors owing to the shifting of water pipelines that often led to damage. 
 
 “Every now and then we suffer shortage of water. Authorities should find some permanent solution to this problem,” said Leena Sharma, another resident of the area. 
 
 However,   officials told TOI, “The problem was fixed by evening and the residents would get proper water supply by tonight.”
 
 Along with the disruption in water supply, certain areas in the city are receiving contaminated water. The drinking water taps in Patel Nagar and nearby areas of Old Gurgaon have been supplying sewage water for some time, giving rise to health concerns among residents.
 
 Residents alleged that despite repeated complaints to MCG and Huda, no action has been taken to fix the contaminated water supply.
