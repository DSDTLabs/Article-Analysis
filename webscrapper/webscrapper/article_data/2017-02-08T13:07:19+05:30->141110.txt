LUCKNOW: Is your child not eating well, avoiding eye contact, gets   often or suffering any sleep disorder? Take note if you find your child watching movies full of violence. These are distress signs a child shows if undergoing depression. According to psychiatrist Harjeet Singh, children are stimulated by audio-visuals. “There is a lot of drama and violence in films and children tend to replicate it in life, forget ting there is no place for drama in real life,’’ said Singh, adding that depressed kids show signs of helpless, hopelessness and worthlessness. 

 For educationist and career counsellor Amrita Dass, in the complex globalised society, an abnormal increase of student suicides is the ‘new normal’. “Kids with strong aptitude for humanities or social sciences are coerced into taking up physics, chemistry, biology and math. High marks are regarded the only criterion for success. Engineering and medical fields continue to be thrust on unwilling children. Tuition and coaching classes keep them away from pursuing extra-curricular activities like sports, performing arts, debate, which are actually stress-busters,” explained Dass. 
 
 Child activist Sangeeta Sharma said a child contemplating suicide shows restlessness. “ Children lacking concentration, avoiding eye contact and getting irritated on petty issues are areas   need to look at and they should not be left alone while parents should handle them with care and patience,’’ said Sharma. 
 
 Explaining suidical behaviour, Singh said in Australia use of firearm to commit suicide is most common but there’s stress on communication, either with parents or friends.
