BENGALURU: With the   concluding on Sunday,   may be finding it tough to predict the outcome, but gamblers in the  , or satta, or matka, are betting high on the BJP. While the odds on the Congress and   were roughly the same a few days ago, closer to the polls, bookmakers believed BJP had a good chance in Nanjangud and a slight edge in Gundlupet.

 The betting market's opinion is evident in the numbers. “If you had bet Rs 100 on April 5 on the BJP winning two seats, you'll get a return of a mere Rs 300, but it has reduced to 100,“ said a bookie based in Bengaluru. By contrast, a similar bet on the Congress earned Rs 500.
 
 While cricket matches attract bets from just about anyone, elections largely attract businessmen and politicians.
 
 The fortunes of the BJP witnessed a steady rise since the election announcement.“Initially, the odds on both the BJP and Congress were 1:1, while the odds for a BJP win have pro g ressively gone down,'' said a bookie in Hub balli, a hot betting destination in Karnataka.
 
 Just two days ago, when Congress and BJP leaders were taking digs at each other with remarks over corruption and caste, the betting industry was in turmoil. Bookies said the numbers changed drastically over the past 48 hours.
 
 The BJP moved from a probability of one seat as on April 5 to two seats on April 8, while the Congress slumped from two seats to 0. Earlier, bookies had placed their bets on a Congress win in both seats, but some emotive issues raised by leaders, and BJP's prospects looked positive.
