BENGALURU: The 2019   polls are a blessing in disguise for state BJP president  , as the central leadership's decision to anoint him the chief ministerial candidate for the   assembly polls in 2018 will cushion him from political storms within the party.

 It is for this reason, party sources say, that Yeddyurappa's detractors are demanding a change in the BJP president and have accepted him as the CM candidate. “The BJP will redraw its caste arithmetic by in cluding OBCs and dalits to adopt the Uttar Pradesh model, but will not lose its focus on Lingayats,“ sources said.
 
 In 2014, the central leadership had carried out a quiet exercise by sounding out some party insiders in Karnataka to look for an educated person in the 40-mid-50s age bracket, bred in RSS-BJP stables and having a blemish-free political record, to be projected as the CM candidate. They were on the look out for someone on the lines of Maharashtra CM   or Goa CM  .
 
 The 2018 polls are linked to 2019 Lok Sabha elections, with the BJP banking on Karnataka to shore up its numbers in the Parliament. With Karnataka politics driven by caste, sources said the party would not like to antagonize Lingayats, the caste which Yeddyurappa belongs to, if it comes to power.
 
 It is learnt that BJP national president Amit Shah will be in Karnataka in the next couple of months for a similar exercise he has now undertaken in West Bengal, Odisha, Telangana, Gujarat and Lakshdweep. He's working with boothlevel workers and getting a feedback on the performance of legislators and MPs.
 
 “Shah is already getting independent reports on the performance of MPs and MLAs in Karnataka. Those facing anti-incumbency in their constituencies will be denied tickets. The party is not likely to give tickets to some MPs who want to contest the assembly elections, including Yeddyurappa. BJP may follow the UP model where the CM   is an MP from Gorakhpur,“ they added.
