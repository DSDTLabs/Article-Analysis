AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Wednesday permitted a petitioner to join the ruling   and opposition   as parties in a PIL that is seeking ban on manifestoes by political parties during elections.

 When the hearing on the PIL came up before the bench headed by the chief justice, the advocate representing the petitioner, managing trustee of an NGO Sewa Gujarati Jayesh Shah, requested the court to allow him to join the Congress and the BJP as party in the proceedings.
 
 Arguing that the Gujarat high court should declare that political parties issuing manifestoes is illegal and unconstitutional. Shah has argued that political parties never fulfil the promises made in manifestoes and, hence, such manifestoes are nothing but pieces of paper without any accountability.
 
 The petitioner has cited manifestoes issued by political parties during the 2014 general elections when manifestoes titled, ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’ and ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’, were issued with high promises. He contended that the ruling party does not make any endeavour to implement the manifestoes. Such violation of poll promises has become routine in India and, hence, such manifestoes are nothing but cheating. Such manifestoes mislead Indian voters for their support and to secure their votes during elections.
 
 After granting permission to the petitioner to bring politicial parties, the BJP and the Congress, to the proceedings, further hearing on the PIL is posted for August 2.
 
 Last year, petitioner Shah had written and published a book titled, ‘Fekuji is now in Delhi’, on poll promises made but not fulfilled by Prime Minister  .
