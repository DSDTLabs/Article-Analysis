NEW DELHI: An Indian freestyle wrestler, who clinched a medal at the   Commonwealth Games, has been questioned by the Australian police and the   organisers for allegedly trying to help his friend gain access to the competition venue on his accreditation. The concerned wrestler, who competed on Saturday, was issued a strict warning by the organisers for his indiscretion.

 
 TOI tried to contact the   ( ) contingent members in Gold Coast and the   ( ) officials in Delhi, but couldn’t get the confirmation on the issue.
 
 However, another WFI source informed that the news about a wrestler helping his friend enter the arena on his accreditation has indeed trickled in from Gold Coast.
 
 Both the wrestler and his friend were interrogated at length by the local police personnel, who discovered that the friend was wearing the wrestler’s accreditation while entering the arena. The friend failed to produce any identity proof when asked for it by the police. It was only after an IOA official intervened into the matter that the wrestler and his friend were let off by the police.
 
 It’s been learnt that India’s chef-de-mission   was later informed about the incident by the organisers. Sisodia, according to sources, has spoken to the wrestler in this regard.
