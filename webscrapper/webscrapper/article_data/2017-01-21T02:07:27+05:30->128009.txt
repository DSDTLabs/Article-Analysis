GURGAON: A group of villagers, who police said were   members, rescued 13   from a truck on Jaipur-Delhi highway on Thursday, a day after a mob of ‘gau rakshaks’ beat up five people to free 135   being transported in trucks on the   expressway.

 There is, however, no report of the villagers assaulting the camel transporters. 
 
 Truck driver Kutabidini, a resident of Mewat (Haryana), and helper Shehzad from Bagpat (UP) were arrested and produced in a local court, which released them on bail on Friday. 
 
 The police said four-five Bajrang Dal members, led by Ashok, intercepted a truck coming from the Jaipur side near Bilaspur toll plaza on NH-8 (also known as Jaipur-Delhi highway) around 8.30pm on Thursday. 
 
 According to the complainant, Ashok, they had received a tip-off that trucks carrying cows were coming towards Bilaspur village, around 20km from the city. However, when they stopped the truck, they found 13 camels stuffed inside the vehicle, and informed the police.
 
 “We asked the driver and the helper get off the truck and identify themselves. Then, we called the police control room,” Ashok claimed.
 
 Bilaspur police rushed to the spot, rescued the animals and arrested the transports. After medical examination, the camels were handed over to their owners. 
 
 “A case under sections 428 and 429 of the IPC and Section 11 of the Prevention Against Animal Cruelty Act has been lodged against the two,” investigating officer Ishwar Singh said.
 
 A group of   stopped four trucks carrying buffaloes on the Jaipur-Gurgaon expressway on Wednesday night and beat up the transporters. The four truck drivers and a helper were booked on charges of animal cruelty. The police found 135 buffaloes and calves, of which one buffalo and 3 calves were dead.
