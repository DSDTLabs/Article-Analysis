CHANDIGARH: The employees of the Chandigarh administration have threatened to drag the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) to court if any   are made in the layout of the employees   2008.

 The administration has increased floor area ratio (FAR) of the housing scheme from 1.50 to 2. On FAR 1.55, a total of 55 flats can be constructed on one acre of land. With the administration increasing the FAR, CHB will now be able to construct 75 flats — 20 more — on one acre of land.
 
 Dharamender Shastri, general secretary of the employees housing scheme, said that there should not be any change in the size of the flats. Unhappy with the delay in the implementation of the scheme, Shastri said that the Punjab and   high court has already directed the board to start construction of the flats.
 
 He added that the employees have already deposited around Rs 57 crore to the administration. Earlier this year, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) had turned down the proposal of the administration to allot land for the housing scheme. Following which MP Kirron Kher had taken up the matter with Union home minister Rajnath Singh, who had assured to resolve the issue.
 
 The administration had proposed to allot land measuring 11.79 acres to CHB for the construction of flats for employees under a self-financing scheme. Nearly 7,000 employees working in different departments of the administration had applied for houses under the scheme. Of these, as many as 3,930 were allotted flats after a draw of lots held in November 2010.
 
 Thereafter, CHB allotted land for the project in Sector 53. The board collected 25% of the price, which amounted to Rs 57 crore. But in 2012, the administration expressed its inability to allot land, since the terms of land acquisition had changed.
