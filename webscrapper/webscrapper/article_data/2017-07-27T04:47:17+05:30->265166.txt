THANE: A 52-year-old housewife was robbed of her   chain and mangalsuta worth Rs 50,000 by two motorcycle-born men near her house in   on Tuesday.

 Police said the victim was heading to the market to buy some groceries and vegetables when the two bikers trailed her. The pillion lunged at her and snatched the gold valuables she was wearing.
 
 The Kasarvadavli police said, “The victim was walking towards a vegetable vendor located in her vicinity. There, she claimed to have seen a black colour motorbike with two youngsters sitting on the edge of the two-wheeler, who were staring at her. After few minutes, the duo nodded at each other and then within a second the pillion rider snatched the lady’s gold  . Before, the victim realized what had happened, the unidentified men had fled away.” 
 
 The victim has given a description of the youngsters to the police and the accused have been booked under Sections 392 and 34 of the IPC for committing robbery. 
 
 “Chain snatching incidents have become a very common thing and it is very risky to step out wearing any jewellery. I have stopped wearing even artificial jewellery, as what if I am targetted. We can’t feel safe any more, even in our locality,” said another woman from Vijay Nagri.
