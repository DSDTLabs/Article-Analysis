GHAZIABAD: A   was seriously injured after he fell from the terrace of a four-storey building while trying to save himself from a monkey at   on Friday evening. 

 Ashish Nayak, a Class IX student of JKG International School, Indirapuram, has been admitted to the intensive care unit of a private hospital in a critical condition. The boy has reportedly suffered multiple fractures and injuries on his head. 
 
 “The boy lives in Phase II in the residential colony and had gone to meet his friends who stay in Phase I. He was playing with his friends on the terrace of a four-storey building in Phase 1 when a monkey suddenly appeared there and started chasing the boys. Ashish, while trying to escape, fell through the shaft of the building to the ground floor. A CISF constable who was visiting his senior in the building, heard the cries of the boy. He took him to hospital,” said Aarti Balyan, president of   RWA, Phase II.
 
 The constable, Sushil Bhoi, had reached the injured child through a drainage pipe (about 40 feet) and brought him out safely. The boy is admitted to the ICU of Shanti Gopal hospital, she said.
 
 Aarti’s husband C P Balyan said Ashish’s father, Sameer Nayak, is in government service while his mother is a nurse. They live in a flat on Cassia Road, he said.
 
 SHO, Indirapuram,   said police visited the spot and the hospital to collect information on the incident.
 
 “So far, no one from the boy’s family has approached us,” Malik added.
 
 This is the third case in which a minor had fallen from a high-rise apartment in Indirapuram in the past one month. A four-year-old girl had died after she allegedly slipped from the balcony of her 10th floor apartment in Indirapuram’s Jaipuria Sunrise society on February 19. The victim, Myra, was alone in her house when the incident took place.
 
 Later on February 26, a 14-year-old girl, Agrima Sharma, died after falling from the sixth-floor balcony of her flat in Shipra Krishna Vista society.
