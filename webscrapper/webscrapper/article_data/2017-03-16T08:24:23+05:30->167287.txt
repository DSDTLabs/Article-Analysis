Pune: A 22-year-old man was nabbed by   personnel from the security hold area of the   on Sunday afternoon after six   were found in his hand baggage.

 Sources said Nitish Tyagi was on his way to Delhi from Pune and was set to board a   flight (SG184) at 4.05pm. He was apprehended around 2.30pm.
 
 “The Pune airport is under the category of hypersensitive airport of the CISF, and security here is always tight. The man had checked in and was in the security hold area where CISF personnel were checking his hand baggage on the X-ray scanner. The officer on duty spotted something suspicious and told Tyagi to open his hand baggage. During the checks, six live cartridges of .32 bore were recovered from his bag. The man was detained for questioning by the CISF, but couldn’t give a satisfactory explanation for the bullets. He was handed over to the Vimantal police station,” a source in the airport told TOI, adding that this did not cause any flight delays.
 
 Vilas T Sonde, police inspector (crime) of the Vimantal police station said Tyagi has been sent to jail. “He was not able to give convincing answers. He said he had some relatives in Delhi who had arms with licenses. However, he didn’t give a specific answer as to why he was carrying the bullets. He has been booked under the Arms Act,” Sonde said.
 
 In February, the Union ministry of civil aviation announced that passengers travelling from seven airports — Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Delhi, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Kochi — would no longer have to go through the stamping process for hand baggage. However, the CISF had raised concerns stating that modifications were needed in the security cover before its implementation, so the enforcement was postponed. The bureau of civil aviation and the CISF would now study the security aspects of these airports again before coming to a decision.
