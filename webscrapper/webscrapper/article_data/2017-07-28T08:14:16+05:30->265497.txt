CHENNAI: To build a unified voice against petroleum based and port-led industrial development along the Tamil Nadu and   coasts by the State and the Centre, fishermen welfare bodies took out a 12-day yatra through the coastal districts that culminated on Thursday in Chennai. The groups opposed the “dilution of coastal protection laws” caused by the replacement of the existing Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification (2011) with an industry-friendly Marine and Coastal Regulation Zone (MCRZ) notification.

 The yatris, who began their journey in Kanyakumari, travelled through Enayam, Colachel where coastal communities are rallying against the Enayam International Container Transhipment Terminal (ICTT) proposed as part of the Centre’s Sagarmala scheme. Peoples’ movement against Enayam ICTT coordinator Jasiah Joseph said, “Located within 20 km of Adani's Vizhinjam port, the   will be a  ,   and  . It will trigger disastrous sea erosion in an already eroding coast and threaten the livelihood of 20,000 families.”
 
 Speaking against the state’s proposed Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region (PCPIR) in the delta region, Coastal Action Network convener Jesu Rathinam contended that even if the state government has delineated only 49 villages in Nagapattinam and Cuddalore districts, the actual adverse impacts will be felt across surrounding regions. Jesu Rathinam said, “Petroleum-based industrialisation has already harmed the delta district. Neduvasal and Kathiramangalam are already on the boil. SIPCOT Cuddalore is a global toxic hotspot. PCPIR will worsen the problems of groundwater salinity and turn the fertile delta into a desert.”
 
 Social activist Prafulla Samantra from Orissa, who recently won the Goldman Prize, was also part of the Yatra.
