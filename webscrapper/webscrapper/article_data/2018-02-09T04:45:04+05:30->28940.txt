MUMBAI: The police on Thursday thwarted city   unit president Sanjay Nirupam’s attempt to sell pakoras outside  . 

 Accompanied by a group of Congress activists and carrying a good many pakoras, Nirupam was detained near Girgaum Chowpaty. The police cited a   order banning assembly of five or more persons in and around Mantralaya. “We are not scared by the action of the Mumbai police, we will continue to sell pakoras near Mantralaya again from Monday,” Nirupam said.
 
 Nirupam said his activists were determined to sell pakoras at Mantralaya following PM Modi’s idea that jobless youths should sell pakoras, which was supported by BJP chief Amit Shah.
