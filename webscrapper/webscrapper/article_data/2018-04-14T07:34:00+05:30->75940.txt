Chandigarh: SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia said on Friday that the Punjab government, having endorsed the conviction of its local bodies minister, Navjot Singh Sidhu, in the Supreme Court in a road rage case dating to 1988, should now dismiss him. 

 Majithia described Sidhu’s presence in the Punjab cabinet as “utterly untenable on moral grounds”. “It is also a grave legal and constitutional absurdity, mocking the Constitution of India. He cannot remain a member of a government which is seeking a judicial endorsement to punish him for murdering an old, innocent and helpless person,” Majithia said.
 
 The SAD leader asked Congress president Rahul Gandhi to “come clean” on murder convicts becoming and remaining ministers in Congress governments at the Centre and states. 
 
 Majthia was accompanied by party leaders Daljeet Singh Cheema and Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal. Grewal said there was no justification for Sidhu continuing in office, as his presence in the council of ministers violated the “principle of collective responsibility”. He added if Sidhu agreed with the government that endorsed his conviction, he had to accept that and resign. “But if he disagrees, he has no right to remain in the cabinet,” Grewal said.
 
 Sidhu’s reaction
 
 Asked about his reaction to Punjab government’s stand in the supreme court case against him, local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu told media persons that he will suffer the burden of the outcome single-handedly. He said that he believes in the judiciary and has full faith in it. Sidhu said he will himself deal with the outcome of the case. “I will carry the burden myself and have nothing more to say about it,” Sidhu said. Asked if he believed that there was any politics behind it, he said the matter was subjudice.
