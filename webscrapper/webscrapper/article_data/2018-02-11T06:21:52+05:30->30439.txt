NEW DELHI: The hashtag, GirlsWhoDrinkBeer, trended nationwide on Saturday following Goa CM   's remarks on the subject. Parrikar had said on Friday that girls drinking   was "a concern." 

 Some posted on Twitter that the remark as "patriarchal" and "sexist." Quite a few tweeted their own photographs drinking beer. 
 
  "I see your fear, Mr Parrikar, and raise you this giant mug," posted @TheCommanist. @rach_aha wrote, "Let's drink our beer and raise a toast for the men who fear." @AsYouNotLike said, "Alcohol has the same detrimental effect, on everybody. It isn't gender biased, whereas you are, Manohar Parikkar (sic)." 
 
 @rkarnad had a slightly different take. He said, "Interpret it how you like, but at least convey that @manoharparrikar was speaking light-heartedly about #GirlsWhoDrinkBeer, to a crowd that took it as a joke."
 
  @RoflGandhi_ saw the funny side of it. "Media is misquoting @manoharparrikar ji. His full statement was "#GirlsWhoDrinkBeer are bad but #GirlsWhoDrinkBeer with Pakodas are angels," he wrote.
