KOLHAPUR: Three wards of the city will be declared 'zero waste wards' from Wednesday as the civic body will start an organic waste composting facility at Mailkhadda. 

 The three wards fall in the   area. The   ( ) has tied up with   - a city-based association of ragpicker women - to run the facility. 
 
 The KMC has provided the land, shelter and other equipment for collection and transportation of the waste from the area to the facility. The organic waste composting machine has a one-tonne capacity. It was provided through the funds by revenue minister Chandrakant  . The total cost of the project is Rs 25 lakh.
 
 Vijay Patil, KMC's chief sanitation inspector, said, "Each day, the machine can compost waste generated from three wards located in the Sambhajinagar area. In all, 16 ragpicker women will be involved in the collection and transportation of the waste. A similar facility will be developed for another five wards from June 5."
 
 Patil said that they had a target of achieving 100% segregation of waste at the source point by December this year to address garbage concerns to a large extent. 
 
 The civic body is planning on generating revenue from organic waste obtained from the machine. The funds will be used to buy more vehicles to collect and transport waste. The idea for the project was floated last year and at present, the work of collection, segregation of the waste through Ekati is done at several areas of the city. The organic waste can be used as fertiliser.
 
  "Ekati has been involved in garbage collection and segregation process since last year. We will involve more organisations to cover the whole city in our decentralisation of the waste processing project. We will ensure that least amount of waste will be transported to the already full dumping grounds," Patil said.
