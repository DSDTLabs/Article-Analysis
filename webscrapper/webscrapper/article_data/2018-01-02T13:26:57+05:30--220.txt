HYDERABAD: Terming the   ( ) Bill as pro-private college management bill, the   on Tuesday organised a massive protest at   (OMC) on Tuesday.

 They said that the bill paves the way for corruption as it removes all regulations for setting up a medical college and will definitely make medical education in India highly expensive. 
 
 “This bill is anti-people. It is pro-rich and pro-private managements. If the said bill is implemented, the cost of medical education and healthcare will rise astronomically. It is also anti-patient since it promotes unscientific mixing of systems. A medical Bill without the concurrence of the medical profession will be a disaster. So, we appeal to the government of India to abolish this bill,” said Dr  , chairman,  . 
 
 The association said that as per the provisions, the government can regulate the fee structure of only up to 40% of the seats at a private medical college and for the remaining seats management will fix the fee structure, which in turn will make medical education in India highly expensive. 
 
 More than 500 junior doctors and medical students took part in the protest organized under the aegis of T JUDA.
