HUBBALLI: The delay in repairing and updating auto fare meters by the department of legal metrology is hampering the process of strict implementation of meters in  .

 The Auto Drivers and Owners’ Association, which is always cursed by the public and involved in arguments regularly for not charging fares according to the meter, has revealed the reason for delay in upgrading auto meters.
 
 The authorities say the initiative to upgrade the meters failed due to the lethargic attitude of auto drivers on fitting updated meters.
 
 Shekharayya Mathapati, president, Autorickshaw Owners’ and Drivers’ Association,  , said that the drivers are open to implementing meters in Hubballi-Dharwad, but the programme has not started due to the delay in upgrading and repairing auto meters. “To hide the lapses, autorickshaw drivers are being blamed, which is unfortunate,” he said. 
 
 He added that drivers are losing out on a full day’s earnings waiting in queues to get the meters repaired.
 
 Pundalik Badiger, general secretary of the association, said there are no qualified experts to repair and upgrade meters. Due to lack of adequate staff, once a week a person in the APMC department repairs and upgrades meters. “They charge Rs 700 whiile the price fixed by the government is Rs 150,” he said. 
 
 He urged the setting up of a centre of legal metrology in the   office so that the delay and negligence on the part of legal metrology officials can be monitored .
 
 Assistant controller of the legal metrology department A S Panishettar said it is true that upgradation is done once a week due to lack of adequate staff. But there is no question of delay. “We will issue orders to the metrology inspector to repair and upgrade fare meters regularly. If required, we are ready to deploy more people. There is no question of charging more. If auto drivers have any concrete evidence, let them give it to us or the district administration. We will initiate stern action,” he added.
