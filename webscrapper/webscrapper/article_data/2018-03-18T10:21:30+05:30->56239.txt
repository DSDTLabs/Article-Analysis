KOLHAPUR: The state's decision to initiate   ban may result in   getting costlier and most dairy operators believe it will adversely affect their business. 

 According to the new policy, plastic pouches in which milk is sold will have to be over 50 microns and recyclable. Consumers will have to shell out 50 paise per pouch and the money will be refunded to them when they return the packets for recycling. 
 
 
  
 Dairy operators said retailers and vendors can be assigned the task to collect the pouches. However, it will cost more to send the used pouches back to the manufacturers, who are supposed to establish recycling plants. They also said that even regular customers may return pouches, but irregular ones will not do so. 
 
 Some said that consumers may shift to local dairies due to the ban. Even milk sold in malls will require a separate system to collect pouches and refund the money. 
 
 Vishwas Patil, chairman of   co-operative dairy, said, "The business will be adversely affected. Since the price of milk will go up, customers will have to shell extra money. 
 
 The government had earlier suggested selling milk in bottles. We had opposed the idea since the whole system of packaging and transportation would have to be changed that would have involved more expenditure."
