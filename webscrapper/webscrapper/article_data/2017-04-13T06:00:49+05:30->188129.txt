NEW DELHI: With a little help from a junior staff member — her mobile phone serving as the   — the   was able to swiftly calculate additional compensation of Rs 5.50 lakh to the kin of an accident victim on Wednesday.

 A bench of Chief Justice   and Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul was convinced that the Karnataka high court had erred in determining the compensation payable to Neelamma, kin of the victim of an accident that occurred in March 2011, under the third party insurance scheme by Reliance General Insurance company.
 
 It found that the multiplier to be applied to potential income of the victim was to be 18 instead of 13 used by the HC. As Justice Khehar was using a pen and paper to do the multiplication, Justice Chandrachud asked the court master for a calculator. With a sheepish grin, she said there was none in the courtroom. But she was quick to ask a junior staff member for her mobile phone that could also be used as calculator. When the staff member handed over her phone to the court master, who in turn handed it over to the judge, it was the turn of Justice Chandrachud to sport a sheepish grin. But the phone calculator did the job for the court. The   said the additional compensation worked out to Rs 3.93 lakh, to be rounded off to Rs 4 lakh.
 
 Adding 6% interest from the date of accident, the bench again used the phone calculator to determine the interest amount to be Rs 1.45 lakh. In total, the additional amount payable to the victim’s kin was Rs 5.38 lakh, which the court again rounded off to Rs 5.50 lakh.
 
 The mobile phone, being returned to its rightful owner, the bench ordered Reliance General Insurance to “release the additional compensation amount to the victim’s kin without any further delay”. Journalists and visitors are prohibited from carrying mobile phones into the courtroom.
