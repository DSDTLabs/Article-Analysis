Chief minister Manohar Parrikar said his government will ensure speed governors are installed in vehicles even as some have raised objections. He told reporters on Wednesday, “Speed governors for taxis is not optional. It’s the law. Speed governors are here to stay.” The transport department already issued a notification making speed governors mandatory for all commercial vehicles with a state permit, national goods permit and all-India tourist permit.
