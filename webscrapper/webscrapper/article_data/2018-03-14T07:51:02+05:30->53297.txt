CHENNAI: In a few months, hungry commuters using smaller suburban stations like Annanur, Perambur carriage works, Pattaravakkam and   can grab a quick bite at the proposed food stalls which would sell snacks and vegetarian food.

 The Chennai division of   is in the process of floating tenders to identify contractors for 80 catering units across suburban stations. Apart from the smaller stations, the move will also cover MRTS stations like Tiruvallikeni, Chepauk and Tirumailai.
 
  
  
 
 Additional units will also be coming up at bigger stations like Chengalpet, Chennai Beach, Nungambakkam and Chennai Central.
 
 Sources say that the division has set a target of installing at least 100 catering units in these stations by the end of this year. “This comes after we got feedback from commuters on the need for stalls which at least sell some snacks and tea and coffee. But these units will be providing other vegetarian food items at controlled prices as well,” a senior official said.
 
 This comes at a time when the   (IRCTC) has also identified contractors to set up food plazas at two MRTS stations – Thiruvanmiyur and Velachery. The former will come up at the elevated platform, while the latter will come up at the entrance to platform one. Both stations are the busiest of the MRTS stations and the move will come as a much needed relief to the 1.1 lakh commuters travelling daily on the Chennai Beach-Velachery MRTS section. Earlier tenders by   had failed to elicit response from contractors.
 
 “In the 1990s, catering units were available at all stations and it was helpful for commuters during peak hours as some would miss their meals at home. But for some reason, the units were closed. So this is a good move,” said K Baskar, member of divisional rail users consultative committee.
