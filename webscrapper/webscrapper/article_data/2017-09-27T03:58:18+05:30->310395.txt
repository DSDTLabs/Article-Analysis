NEW DELHI: Reacting to reports of forced conversions of Hindu Rohingya women to Islam at Bangladeshi relief camps for  , minority organisation Jamiat Ulama-i- Hind’s senior functionary Niaz Ahmed Farooqui said he had no knowledge or information about any such attempts and claimed the Jamiat was against all forced conversions.

 According to a news report in ‘Mail Today’ newspaper, many Hindu Rohingya women revealed that they were harassed, forced to remove sindoor, break bangles among other things in Bangladeshi relief camps.
 
 It was stated in the report that “Hindu Rohingyas living in   relief camps have purportedly become a soft target for Muslim Rohingyas in the country. Both have taken shelter after coming from   but the difference is in the numbers, and that is the key”.
 
 Farooqui said, “I don’t know anything about the report of conversions so I will not comment on the matter. However, I would like to make it clear that the Jamiat has always been against forced conversions to any religion.”
 
 All India Muslim Personal Law Board member Kamal Faruqui said he had not seen the report and would not like to make a comment till he sees it.
