HYDERABAD:   are bracing for tough days this New Year what with the Union health ministry releasing a draft notification on Thursday, stating that they will have to clear uniform   (NEXT) upon completion of their internship. 

 They fear that if the draft Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill, 2016 is passed by the  , their chances of setting up practice as a qualified medical practitioner will be remote even after successfully clearing their MBBS final exam and internship period.
 
 The draft notification - for which the Union healthy ministry has given time to stakeholders to register their objections till January 6, 2017 - is likely to affect future of around 8,000 medicos. 
 
  "This is a ridiculous rule that the health ministry is planning to bring in as a medico has to appear in over 100 different internal, external, pre-final, final and practicals during his five-and-half-year MBBS course period," said G Srinivas, president, Telangana Junior Doctors' Association. The proposed exam will not only act as an exit exam for MBBS graduates, but also entrance exam for PG medical courses, a clearance exam for foreign medical graduates (those who pursued medicine in foreign countries) and job entry exam for recruitment in central health services. 
 
  Nearly 3,400 MBBS seats are offered by 25 medical colleges in Telangana, in addition to 4,500 MBBS seats offered by 31 collges in Andhra Pradesh every year. These MBBS graduates will have to clear NEXT as and when they complete their internship period after a period of five-and-half-year study of medicine. 
 
  Medicos from AP and Telangana are not convinced about the advantages. "How can the government treat a foreign medical graduate on par with a local medical college graduated and ask them to take the same test," V Manoj, outgoing president of Gandhi Medical College House Surgeons' Association, said.
