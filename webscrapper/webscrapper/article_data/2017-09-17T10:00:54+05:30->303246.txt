PATNA:   will launch on Sunday an Android based mobile application, ‘Bandhan Tod’, for teaching girls about the importance of education, the evil of child marriage and dowry system. The app has been developed by Gender Alliance, a pan-state network of 274   and an initiative by the United   (UNFPA) working to support the government efforts in eradicating child marriage and dowry system in Bihar.
 
  “The   is named after a campaign of the same name to reach out to millions of girls and women in the state and also to train and   across Bihar on important issues such as child marriage, dowry and girl education,” a Gender Alliance source said.
  
  One of the main features of the app is an SOS alert, which any girl being forced into marriage or being ill-treated for dowry can use. That alert will notify all members of the 274 civil society organizations who, in turn, will mobilize the administrative forces to rescue the girl.
  
  The major policy reforms on which the campaign will focus are promoting gender equality, quality education to adolescent and young girls and ending child marriage in Bihar.
  
  “Video messages from deputy CM, film actor Neetu Chandra, social activist Kamla Bhasin and others have been included in the app,” said Bina Kumari, programme official at Gender Alliance.
  
  As per the NHFS-4 data, youth constitute 40% of the state population, half of them being girls. The figure is estimated to rise up to 47% by 2030. The potential of these girls remains untapped. Four out of 10 girls in Bihar are married below 10 years while 13% of them become mothers in their teenage. Only 22% completed 10 years of education.
