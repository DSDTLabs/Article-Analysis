CHENNAI: All eyes were on javelin thrower  , who became the first Indian to qualify for the final of the   in London last month, on day two of the   here at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Tuesday. As expected, Davinder won gold; but his performance was way below par. Davinder's best throw of 75.12m, in his second attempt, made him a clear winner with Services'   (74.19m) and   of Punjab (74.03m) finishing second and third respectively.

 However, Davinder, who is set to meet union sports minister   in the first week of October to push for his inclusion in the TOPs list, was a “disappointed man” as he had thrown a distance of 84.22m in the Worlds to make the final cut.
 
 “I'm not happy with my show. I'm capable of clearing 85m,” Davinder said after his performance. However, Davinder cited a “shoulder muscle pull” during the qualifier on Monday as the reason for his ordinary outing.
 
 “I suffered a muscle pull in my right shoulder during the qualifying round. I couldn't put in my full effort during each throw and it hampered my performance. I will go to Patiala and start the recovery process as well train for the Federation Cup,” said Davinder.
 
 With national record holder Ankit Sharma missing out on the meet with an injury, Railway's SE Shamsheer registered his maiden nationals gold with a leap of 7.74m. Shamsheer came up with his best effort in the fourth attempt and he didn't proceed with his next two attempts. Haryana's Sahil Mahabali (7.56m) finished second, while Services' M Silambarasan finished third with 7.53m.
 
 “I never expected to win gold. I'm thrilled as it's my personal best. The track here at the main Stadium was good and it helped me gain speed. I have improved a lot ever since I started training under our national coach Bedros Bedrosian,” Shamsheer said.
 
 In the men's 100m sprints, Mohammad Sadath of Services finished first in a tight photo finish registering 10.57s, followed by Tamil Nadu's Elakkiyadasan and Services' Vidya Sagar.
