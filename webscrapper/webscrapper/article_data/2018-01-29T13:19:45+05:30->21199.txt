ITANAGAR: At least 50 houses and shops were razed by a devastating fire in the market area of   district's Dirang on Saturday. 

 West   police superintendent PN Khrimey said on Sunday that no human casualty has been reported, but many buildings in the area have been completely burnt down. Officials have not been able to assess the loss, but victims said the damage has been worth several crores. 
 
 The SP said the cause of the fire has not been established yet and an investigation has been launched into it. 
 
 On Saturday, two state police fire tenders were pressed into service while the   and the National Institute of Mountaineering and Allied Sports provided five tankers to combat the blaze. 
 
 The SP, deputy commissioner Sonal Swaroop and other officers rushed to the spot and monitored the situation. An inspection bungalow has been designated as temporary relief camp, with food supplies being managed by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP).
 
 Khrimey lauded the SSB, the ITBP, local police, fire-fighters and local residents for helping in rescuing people caught in the blaze. On December 21, a fire at Niti Vihar had left 37 families roofless.
