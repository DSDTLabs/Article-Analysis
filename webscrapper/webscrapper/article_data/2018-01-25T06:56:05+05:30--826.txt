NEW DELHI: A man   of   his   has been   on a peculiar ground — the woman’s admission that the entire chain of   leading to her rape was nothing but “hallucination”. Taking account of her admission, the court found no need to examine other witnesses.

 The FIR in the in the alleged incident was registered three months after she started working at the accused’s house. While the man’s wife stayed at work from 9am to 10pm, the man stayed home. According to the police, the man initially made advances at the house help, seizing every opportunity, and later raped her on July 2, 2017. Though she ran away from the house, she did not report the matter to the police for two days as she had allegedly been threatened by the man.
 
 At the time of her deposition, though, she claimed that she would imagine herself getting into adverse situations. As it turned out, all such situations would only be figments of her imagination. Her state of mind, therefore, led her to think that her employer had not paid her salary and was harassing her. She even hallucinated that he had raped her as a result of which she filed a complaint with the police. Advocate Prashant Mendiratta, who argued in favour of the accused employer, stressed that the woman’s deposition had left nothing for the prosecution to build the trial on.
 
 The woman later resiled from her initial claim saying she did not want any action against her employer. “Prosecutrix testified that she does not want any action... as he never treated her badly or threatened her,” noted fast-track judge Gautam Manan.
 
 Even her medical examination turned out to be negative as no semen could be detected on the samples collected.
