 The match was between Oxbridge XI and Public Schools XI. Soha said, "We hope to have enough players to have a Pataudi XI instead of Oxbridge XI next year. It’s a memorial match we plan to host every year on Abba’s birthday (January 5). This year would have been his 76th birthday. We celebrate his birthday with a cricket match not only because he devoted so much of his life to the sport, but because his life reflected the lessons cricket teaches you – teamwork, sportsmanship and most of all, that no matter what obstacles and challenges life throws at you, you must bounce back like a cricket ball. This match was special because Ibrahim played."
