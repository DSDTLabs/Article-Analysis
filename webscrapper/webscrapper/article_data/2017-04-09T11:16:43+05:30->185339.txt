AMRITSAR: Amritsar Member of Parliament   Aujla has sought registration of an FIR against persons responsible for taking decision to install the nations tallest national flag at Attari international border without conducting any technical study, which was not only resulting in an insult to the Tricolour but also causing much embarrassment to nation at the hands of Pakistani media.While talking to TOI on Saturday, MP Gurjit Singh   said strict action should be taken against the persons who decided to go ahead with the project without conducting any technical study.Without naming anyone, he said FIRs should be registered against all such persons.“I will take up the issue with Prime Minister,“ said Aujla, adding that the decision was taken to satisfy ego of `one person.' Former local bodies minister Anil Joshi had laid the foundation stone of the project and inaugurated the same on March 5. However, within a month of its hoisting, the national flag had to be replaced six times after either it was torn or came down due to strong winds at the height of 350 feet.

 While stating that the tallest flag should have not been hoisted without proper study of climatic conditions at the height of 350 feet, former BJP MLA-turned-Congress leader Dr   also demanded strict action against the persons whose negligence had caused much embarrassment to the nation.
 
 Meanwhile, Amritsar deputy commissioner   informed that he had brought the issue to the knowledge of the home department and suggested to form a committee of subject experts before hoisting the national flag again at Attari. On Friday, the national flag came down during the daily Beating the Retreat ceremony after unsuccessful attempts to hoist it. Aujla said no one considered about the pressure on the flag exerted by strong winds before installing it.
