NEW DELHI: Delhi  , which has missed several deadlines, is finally getting ready for a safety audit. 

 Sources said the audit is scheduled for May 22-23. It is undertaken by the metro rail safety commissioner and after his approval, the line can be started. “The dates have been given. If the commissioner’s inspection takes place as scheduled and approval is given, operations can be started immediately,” said a senior government official. Sources said officials want the launch to be around May 26 — when the central government completes three years in power. 
 
 The ITO to Kashmere Gate section is the last one on the Central Secretariat-Kashmere Gate corridor, also called the Heritage line. The 9.37km-long corridor was delayed by several months because of various “challenges” faced during the construction of the Kashmere Gate Metro station, the only station in the network to have three intersecting lines, said a Metro official. The Red line ( ) and the Yellow line ( ) already intersect at Kashmere Gate. Once the Heritage line is completed, there will be three corridors available at the station for interchange. “This underground section has four stations — Delhi Gate, Jama Masjid, Lal Quila and Kashmere Gate,” said the senior Delhi Metro official. The section was scheduled to open in October 2016 after its original deadline of December 2015 was missed.
 
 Trials on the section between ITO and Kashmere Gate, which is 5.17 kms, started on August 10, 2016. The Heritage line will be an extension of the Escorts Mujesar-ITO corridor.
