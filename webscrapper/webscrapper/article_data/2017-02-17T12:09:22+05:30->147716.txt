 Cold 

    
 
 Hip Hop 
 Frontman Adam   seems to be on his way to make good on his promise of 'Maroon 5' coming up with an album soon-ish. The single 'Cold' that the band dropped, hints at what the album’s theme may be — R&B. Collaborating with rapper Future, the track has almost a minute-long lyrical interlude, which works in its favour, establishing it as a sure-shot earworm. With all the makings of a club hit, the band has blended their music amazingly with Future’s auto-tuned rap lyrics. 
 
 No one can say this time that Levine didn’t work the crowd. What’s also amazing is their video that has him getting a call and dropping in at the rapper’s house to sample a track. There, he downs a spiked drink and we see the year’s most tripped out music video which resembles a class-A acid trip. This package is surely going to make big news. Known to experiment with their style in every album, Cold marks what could possibly be their finest work yet.
