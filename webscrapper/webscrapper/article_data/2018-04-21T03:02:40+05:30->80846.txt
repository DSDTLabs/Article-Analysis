NEW DELHI: Launching a fresh attack on Election Commission of India, AAP on Friday alleged that it was “biased” in its stand on the disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs and had made a recommendation to the President “under a conspiracy with PM Narendra Modi” to destabilise the AAP government.

 Referring to the remarks of  , the former legal adviser of the poll panel, that his opinion was not taken before making the recommendation, AAP spokesperson   said on Friday, “Now it has been further established that EC was biased. It clearly means that the advice for disqualification came from the PM because the advice of Mendiratta was not taken over it.”
 
 Staying the decision, the Delhi high court has asked EC to hold an oral hearing of the 20 MLAs. The AAP legislators had claimed that they were not given any hearing before the EC took the decision.
 
 Bharadwaj also questioned the impartiality of former chief election commissioner (CEC) A K   during whose tenure the decision was taken. Joti was a Gujarat-cadre IAS officer and continued to remain close to   even while he was CEC, he alleged.
