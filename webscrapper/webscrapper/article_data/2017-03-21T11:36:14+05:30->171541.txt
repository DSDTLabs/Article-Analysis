 has been absent from the big screen for a while now, as he was busy with his next project ‘Kaatru Veliyidai’. At the recent audio launch of the   and   starrer, the makers also released a second film trailer.

  
  
 As compared to the first trailer, this one is drastically different and gives us a peek at the film’s intense and serious storyline. While the first trailer focused more on the breezy romance between the two leads, this new trailer sheds some light on a troubled relationship in the backdrop of war, turmoil and a series of chaotic events. 
 
 Karthi is seen in many different looks, much like his character of an air force pilot who seems to have a lot of grey shades. The crackling chemistry between Karthi and Aditi is visible more than ever apart from the brief glimpses of a action sequences. 
 
 Overall, ‘Kaatru Veliyidai’ seems to have something for everyone and it looks like Mani Ratnam has another hit in the making, much like ‘Roja’ or ‘Bombay’. 
 
 The romantic thriller is all set to release on April 7.
