Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Friday rejected the   government’s plea to recall its order directing it to pay Rs 1 lakh to a litigant who exposed fraud by regional transport offices issuing fitness certificates to transport vehicles and buses.

 A bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Anil Menon was hearing the state’s application to recall a direction in its November 2017 order. Noting non-compliance with its February 2016 verdict, the court had then ordered the state to pay Rs 1 lakh as costs to Pune-based petitioner Shrikant Karve.
 
 Karve, in his PIL, had drawn the court’s attention to irregularities in RTOs where fitness certificates were being issued/renewed without mandatory tests.
 
 The judges expressed “surprise” that the state’s application said Karve had been granted cost without any such special prayer being made by him. “The contention is very shocking. It is clear that costs must follow the event,’’ said the bench.
 
 The judges pointed that only due to Karve, who appeared in person, “the fraud in broad daylight by one of the officers was brought to the notice of this court.”
 
 In one instance, the officer had travelled from Solapur to Pune and issued 74 fitness certificates in a day on a private property, and of these, 62 were to one company.
 
 They said the minimum relief that can be granted to Karve is to ensure he is compensated for travel from Mumbai to Pune for the court hearings and also for the large amounts spent to get information through Right to Information Act.
 
 “If we work out on actual basis, costs incurred will be much more than Rs 1 lakh,’’ they added.
 
 The government’s advocate said it was not proper to impose costs when review meetings were on. He also said the money would have to be paid from public exchequer. But the judges said the court was concerned about the mandatory tests and the government cannot dispute the fact that action was taken only because of Karve’s initiative.
