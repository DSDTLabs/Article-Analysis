NEW DELHI: Even as the party attacks   for not acting against RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his family in alleged graft cases, BJP sees the Bihar CM's support to NDA presidential nominee   as a serious division in the alliance rather than an "isolated" act. 

  A senior BJP member said Kumar's support to Kovind was reminiscent of his stance when he had supported UPA's presidential nominee   in 2012 despite being part of NDA. Subsequently, Kumar parted ways with the NDA. 
 
  "By support to the NDA nominee, Kumar has expressed displeasure with RJD and Congress and the 'mahagathbandhan' will not last six months," he claimed. The party is keenly seeing what Kumar's position on the vice-president's election will be. 
 
  BJP's optimism is in contrast to remarks by JD(U) members like K C Tyagi, who said Kumar's support to Kovind did not have political ramifications beyond the presidential poll. However, while reacting to RJD and Congress's criticism of the CM, even Tyagi has recalled JD(U)'s alliance with BJP when Vajpayee was PM. 
 
  BJP feels the CM is keen to differentiate himself from his partners. "Candidature of   was a known secret. Kumar could have waited for two days. But he had made up his mind and Kovind's selection made it easy for him," the BJP member said. He said Meira Kumar's particular Scheduled Caste was a sizeable one in Bihar and it could have been a poll ploy to support her. "But a large section of JD(U) wanted to join hands with BJP." 
 
  After support for demonetisation, the latest trigger for Kumar to explore a break-up with the 'mahagathbandhan' is premised on several factors, including possibility of legal action against Lalu's family members. The CM, it is felt, has also realised the futility of forging a grand national alliance against BJP since Congress is unlikely to formally back anyone for PM other than  .
