A direct train service linking western and southern suburbs of Chennai through   may be in the offing, but the route is circuitous. The city could have gotten a direct link between   in the south and Avadi in the west through   had a proposal mooted by then MP   from the DMK been executed.

 Eight years ago, there was a proposal to lay a new 55km railway line between Guduvanchery and Avadi. It was included in the railway budget and continues to be in the list of projects till date. But it is unlikely to come up as the project has been shelved due to lack of funds. In the last two budgets, it was given a paltry Rs 25 lakh each. Officials said the project would be a logistical nightmare today as the areas are thickly populated and land acquisition would be extremely difficult.
 
 
 Baalu was then the Sriperumbudur MP and chairman of the standing committee of railways. The project would have given suburban train connectivity to heavily-industrialised Oragadam-Irungatukottai-Sriperumbudur corridor.
 
 “There was another proposal to link   and Sriperumbudur through Villivakkam-Anna Nagar in 2001. That never took off,” said Abraham Jacob, former chief operations manager of  .
 
 The other line connecting southern and western suburbs will come through when railways will complete electrification of the Thakkolam-Arakkonam line on the Chengalpet-Arakkonam section. A 5km stretch could not be electrified due to objection by INS Rajali near Arakkonam. Defence ministry has submitted Rs 60 crore and the work to lay a roundabout line has started and will be completed soon, said officials. “This will pave the way to run   circular rail services,” said a senior railway official.
