BHOPAL: Poor state of labs, absenteeism among teaching faculty and books missing from shelves in library. That was the scene, which greeted   (RGPV)   Kalpana Shrivastava, when she went round the RGPV-UIT on Friday. Taking a serious view of all that was amiss, director Sanjay Silakari and absentee teaching faculty were issued show-cause notices. UIT, an engineering college of  , is on the campus. 

 Principal secretary, technical education, Shrivastava was given charge of RGPV vice-chancellor of RGPV recently. Talking to TOI, Shrivastava said she was shocked while visiting the library of the college. "Book were not on shelves in the library," she said. When she asked library staff about books, she was told that they were in lock and key. "Books were lying on floor. I directed officials to put book back in shelves in next two days," she said. 
 
 Shrivastava reached the UIT campus around 10 am. "It was surprising that neither director nor exam controller was there when exams were being held. Computer science exam was going on, but the lab was in a poor state," she said.
 
 While inspecting the college, Shrivastava interacted with students. "Students told me permanent teaching faculty do not come to teach them. Students informed me infrastructure of the college is in poor state, which needs immediate solution," said Shrivastava. She instructed officials to set things right in next 15 days. 
 
 She asked students to create a WhatsApp group, where students can directly get in touch with her. "I have asked students to create a WhatsApp group 'The Kids'. In this group, only students and I will be available. They can tell their problems through that group," she said. 
 
 She visited the boys' hostel, where condition was equally bad. Shrivastava gave hostel wardens 20 days time to make things correct in next 20 days. She directed officials to appoint a dedicated gardener for maintaining greenery on the campus
