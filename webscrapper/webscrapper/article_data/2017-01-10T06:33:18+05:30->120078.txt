PUNE: The Bibvewadi   recently arrested Faruk Shaikh, a 35-year-old criminal on police record who was absconding for the last seven months. Shaikh, who was picked up from Parvati Darshan area, was on the run since May 4 last year after a gun shot fired by him had injured two persons, including a five-year-old boy, in Ambiknagar, Bibvewadi.

 The police team, led by inspector Santosh Barge, has recovered a country-made pistol, which Shaikh had kept in Solapur. The five-year-old Samarth Londhe, who had sustained gun shot wound on his left leg, has now recovered. The other person,  , had received a minor injury on his right palm. Investigations have revealed that Shaikh was involved in a murder in Chennai in 2016. “We have handed him over to the Chennai police,” Barge said.
 
 Both Nitish Patange (24), the complainant, and Shaikh stay in the same colony in Ambiknagar. In November 2015, they had gone to Mumbai for a marriage where they had a quarrel over some petty issue. 
 
 Patange and Shaikh had a fight over the same issue on May 4. Patange was at Shaikh’s house when he pulled out a pistol and placed it on Patange’s chest. As he was about to pull the trigger, Patange’s friend, Mane, pushed Shaikh aside. “Shaikh then fired at Mane but the bullet grazed his right palm and hit Samarth, who was standing behind,” Barge said.
