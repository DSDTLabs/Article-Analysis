KOCHI: Medical experts suggested that health and physical education in schools was the need of the hour and one dedicated hour for the same each day will help students in avoiding serious health issues as they grow up.   said on Sunday that combating obesity was one of the main objectives behind the new directive.

 Senior gastroenterologist Dr Rajeev Jayadevan said: “In an urban space there is little area for kids to get some exercise. One of the few areas they can get some exercise is the school playground. Preventive value of exercise is more when they engage in exercise at a young age. Due to lack of exercise, people in their twenties are having diabetes, heart problems and blood pressure.”
 
 Assistant professor at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham’s school of medicine Dr Ravi Sankaran said: “Today, lots of youngsters have muscular and postural problems. Most kids sit down with a tablet or in front of the television and their body will grow the way it is used. If it is a sedentary position, the body will become short, with a deformed spine and pelvis. Their posture and muscles will be affected.”
 
 He said that an hour of exercise would be beneficial during teen years and that they would encounter lesser health problems later. “Most of the time we find that in a well-developed body, the joints won't be under much strain. If you are young, your body will be able to repair the damages caused by physical activity, heal faster and become more resilient. If you have not engaged in such exercises at a young age, you will not get these benefits,” he said.
 
 Physical medicine consultant at   said: “Problems concerning lack of exercise among children is well documented. The problem is that schools will not take these classes. It is important that such classes are made compulsory,” she said.
