NEW DELHI: The BCCI’s finance team members, who keep a track of all income and expenditure related to the game, hardly get a chance to step outside the office as it is strictly a desk job. Now, for the first time in the history of the richest cricket board, a 25-member finance committee is being sent for an excursion to Lonavala for a two-night stay – thanks to the initiative taken by BCCI’s CFO  .

 
 
 
 It is quite a departure from the past, wherein the   managers are handling the day-to-day affars of BCCI while the office-bearers would be custodians of all the policy decisions, and a manifestation of the board gradually moving towards a more professional approach towards its functioning.
 
 
 
 In order to build a healthy work culture and motivate each other to develop more trust, Rangnekar suggested this incursion to all BCCI members, including CoA chairman Vinod Rai, Diana Edulji, acting-secretary   and CEO Rahul Johri and they readily agreed to extend support. “This is a good initiative from the   under Rangnekar and it would be used as a tool for team building,” Johri told TOI on Thursday.
 
 Unlike board meetings where BCCI has to shell out several lakhs of rupees per day, this three-day outing of the finance committee isn’t costing BCCI much. With the workers, who are continuously facing challenges because of a lack of job security due to constant threat of change of guard in BCCI, this trip is certainly a welcome change and a reward for their hard work.
 
 Two workers from the   will also join their Mumbai colleagues on the trip.
