Take cues from Deepika Padukone’s   panache to look   or  :

 
 
 Look polished with a sharp middle part paired with a super straight low pony. A centre part not only flatters your hair, but your face as well by defining your cheekbones. When trying this one, hide those   elastics by using a section of your own hair to wrap around its base. 
 
 
 
 A severe side part and a low pony has become Deepika Padukone’s go-to  . For this elegant hairdo, use a boar bristle brush to direct your hair strands back. Then, smooth a quarter-size amount of gel from your hairline to the base of your pony to keep any flyways under check. Finally make the low pony and wrap a sliver of hair around the elastic band for a finished look. 
 
 
 
 The just-out-of-the-bed messy ponytail is now red-carpet worthy. This   instantly gives your look an effortless feel and appears feminine and romantic. Add braids or twists for a boho look, wear it up high or low and secure with a scrunchie. 
 
 Tip: The messy ponytail is all about volume, so remember to tease and curl before tying your hair up. Invest in some texturising spray to keep the volume and messiness intact. 
 
 
 
 If the harsh slicked-back ponytail is not your style, pump up the volume at the crown for a softer look. That heightened pouf instantly adds glamour to your look and is appropriate for a date night. Plus, it works for all hair textures. 
 
 Tip: Getting the perfect “poof” involves teasing or backcombing, and hence it’s best to work on “day old” (not freshly washed) hair. Don’t have a thick mane? You can consider adding a clip-in extension at the crown to create maximum fullness.
