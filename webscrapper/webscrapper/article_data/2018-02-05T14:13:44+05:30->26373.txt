MARGAO:: Parking woes in   and its neighbouring   may reduce with the Goa State Urban Development Agency (GSUDA) undertaking two multi-storied parking lots proposed opposite the South Goa Planning and Development Authority (SGPDA) building, at the entrance to Margao city.

 Town and Country Planning (TCP) Minister   said that the low lying uncultivated paddy fields near the KTC bus stand that were filled and utilised for setting up stalls for the December 8 feast fair will be the site for the parking project. “After the Carnival festivities I will display the plan at the MMC ( ) and the (Margao Old Market) tinto inviting public suggestions towards this parking facility that may take two years. The land has been acquired for parking and other future needs. It will be handed over by the SGPDA to the GSUDA. Presently, the KTC bus stand is more like a bus shed. There is a proposal by the ministry of surface transport to erect a bus port,” said Sardesai.
