BAREILLY/PILIBHIT/SHAHJAHANPUR: Three ministers, Union MoS finance  , Union minister for women and child development   and MoS women and child development Krishna Raj come from Bareilly, Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur respectively. In the 2014 LS polls, the party, riding on a Modi wave, captured 4 of 5   seats here, including Bareilly, Aonla, Pilibhit and Shahjahanpur. However, in the absence of a strong sentiment in favour of the party and with effects of demonetisation, the ministers are said to be under immense pressure to repeat their 2014 feat. Of the total 22 assembly constituencies in Bareilly division, BJP won only five in the 2012 polls.

 As Union MoS finance Santosh Gangwar played an active role in the distribution of tickets here, there was a lot of resentment among candidates who were declined tickets on the remaining five seats. Gangwar was accused of repeating his favourite candidates even after they had lost two or three consecutive elections.
 
 Gangwar has been camping in Bareilly since the nomination process began and hasn't left the fort. “I went to Delhi for the Union Budget. After polling in Bareilly, I will camp in Allahabad,“ Gangwar said. The main emphasis of Union minister for women and child development Maneka Gandhi's poll campaign is in Puranpur constituency of Pilibhit. Though she gave some time for campaigning in Pilibhit and Baheri seats too, Barkhera and Bisalpur constituencies didn't see much of her.
 
 The popularity of MoS women and child development Krishna Raj, BJP's non-Jatav Dalit face, soared in Shahjahanpur after she was inducted into PM Modi's cabinet last year. Raj's presence in the district's poll campaign had helped the party's local unit bury their internal differences and rally behind her in the campaign.
