HYDERABAD: Students along with teaching and non-teaching staff of the   (UoH) held a protest rally within the campus on Thursday against a recent notification issued by the University Grants Commission’s ( ). The notification stated that fresh reservation roster for faculty recruitments have to be prepared considering department as a unit instead of the university/college.

 As per the former policy, a university was considered as a single unit for calculating faculty posts under reserved categories. For instance, while filling up teaching posts, vacancies across departments were clubbed together to decide the reservation quota. With the new policy, each department in a varsity will be treated separately to calculate the reserved positions.
 
 “If considered department wise, it will drastically reduce the number of posts allotted to reserved category candidates as some departments have very few posts. This means, if a department has only one post, it will by default abolish possibility of reservation,” said  , member of Dialogue for Academic Justice.
 
 The rally, demanding rollback of UGC circular, was held from the administrative building to the main gate.
 
 The SC/ST/OBC students and university staff have decided to go on a hunger strike from April 15 if the UGC fails to rollback the new system for appointment of faculty members in higher educational institutions.
 
 “The new roster system will be a major setback for the SC/ST/OBC teachers and candidates seeking teaching jobs to ensure adequate representation in an educational institution. We will launch a hunger strike on April 15 as part of a nationwide call given against the new system,” said  , member of SC/ ST Teachers Forum at UoH.
 
 As per the ministry of human resource development figures, there are 16,600 sanctioned posts for teachers in central universities in India. Of these, 5,928 posts are vacant.
