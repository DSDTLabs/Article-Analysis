LUCKNOW: A man from Fatehpur has lodged an FIR against Pallavi Patel, the   of a  , and her husband Pankaj Singh at Gomtinagar police station on Thursday for usurping his   fraudulently. 

 A senior police officer said the complainant himself had been booked in the case in the past but given a clean chit later. 
 
 A BJP leader from Fatehpur district, Pankaj Tripathi had bought a flat in Vivek Khand, Gomtinagar in 2013. His close acquaintance Pankaj Singh began staying in the flat.
 
 “Singh worked closely with me and camped in Lucknow for business. I had given him a room to stay,” said Tripathi over the phone. 
 
 Earlier this year, Tripathi asked Singh to vacate the house. However, Singh allegedly kept evading the issue and did not vacate the house. A confrontation occurred between the two in May.
 
 “Using his clout, Singh got an FIR registered against me at Gomtinagar police station. He produced a forged sale deed to claim ownership of the flat,” said Tripathi.
 
 However, during investigation, police found that Tripathi had been framed.
 
 “We cross-checked the documents and found that Tripathi owned the flat. An explanation will be sought from the officer who booked Tripathi in the past,” said SSP Deepak Kumar. 
 
 When police cross-checked, they found Tripathi was in Delhi on the day the sale deed was executed. Thereafter, Singh and the others were booked for rioting and forging documents.
 
 In the FIR filed at Gomtinagar police station, Tripathi alleged that Pallavi, Singh and their aides Vishal Tiwari, Devendra Pratap Singh and Vijay Pratap Singh had attacked Tripathi and his wife, held them at gunpoint and threatened to get him killed. 
 
 The couple also allegedly boasted about their connections and threatened Tripathi by saying that Singh was related to Shiv Kumar Patel alias Dadua, a dreaded bandit from Chitrakoot, who was gunned down in 2007 by police.
