NAGPUR:  , a celebrated physician during the Lord Buddha period, used ‘panchakarma chikitsa’ as envisaged in Ayurveda to effectively cure various diseases at a time when there was no modern tools available to treat patients, said Dr  , on Saturday. She was speaking on   Buddha dhammat yogdan’ at a programme organized at Ramai Buddha Vihar, Ramaiwadi, Shri Nagar. 

 Throwing light on the life of Jivaka, Nandagavali said that Prince Abhaya, son of Magadha king Bimbisar, found a child abandoned by his mother on the roadside. Moved by the plight of the child, Abhaya took him to his palace and named him Jivaka. 
 
 When Jivaka grew up, he decided to study medical science. As he was searching for a guru, he came to know that Pingala, a famous physician of that time, lived in Takshashila. Jivaka studied medicine under the tutelage of Pingala for several years. After completion of his studies, he decided to return to the palace, Nandagavali said.
 
 As Jivaka was on his way home, he took a halt at Saletha city for rest. There, he came to know that a young daughter of the city’s wealthiest man was sick. She had the problem of severe headache for years though she was being treated by well-known physicians. Jivaka then approached the father of the girl and sought permission to treat her, Nandagavali said. 
 
 Unimpressed, the man refused Jivaka the permission though the latter was confident of curing the young girl’s headache, she added.
 
 After repeated requests, the man finally agreed to give Jivaka a chance. Jivaka then collected the herbs he wanted, prepared a medicine and administered it to the girl through her nostrils. Happy with the result, her father presented a golden chariot to Jivaka, Nandagavali said. 
 
 “Once he cured   and also his grandfather Bimbisar,” said Nandagavali. AK Patil conducted and also proposed a vote of thanks.
