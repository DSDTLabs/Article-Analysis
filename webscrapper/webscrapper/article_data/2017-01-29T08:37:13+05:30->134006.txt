CHARMINAR: Once the gateway to a mansion of the Salar Jung family, the   kaman, is a picture of neglect now. Large and small hoardings relegate it to a blink-and-you-miss it structure which was once protected by heritage stipulations. 

 Signage crawl of existing business establishments, including textile shops, covering large areas of the structure. The signs of disrepair too are now showing. The railing on the roof is broken. Experts pointed out that a part of Salar Jung's famed collection was first housed in the Diwan Deodhi, much before the   was even constructed. 
 
 "The Diwan Deodhi was one of the first structures to be listed as a protected heritage monument by the then  . It was then HUDA vice chairman V K Bawa who sought to get the structure included on the heritage list. While the deodhi itself was pulled down in phases, only the gateway remains. This is all the more reason to protect the structure," noted heritage expert   said.
 
 At a time when the government is mulling a tramway between   and Madina, there is no heritage policy which is in force.
