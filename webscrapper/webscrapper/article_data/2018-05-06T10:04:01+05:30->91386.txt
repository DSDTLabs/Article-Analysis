LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister   on Saturday conducted the aerial survey of the storm hit areas of UP - cutting short his election campaign tour in Karnataka - where the super storms claimed the lives of 73 people on Wednesday.

 
 He also distributed cheques to people affected by dust storm in Agra's Fatehabad. "Relief has been provided to the affected. Kin of those who died have been given Rs 4 lakh as ex-gratia and the injured are given free treatment in hospitals," said Adityanath.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 As per earlier schedule, Yogi, who landed in Karnataka on Thursday, was to campaign there on Friday and Saturday also.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 On Thursday, opposition had attacked Yogi for campaigning in Karnataka at a time when many districts in his state were ravaged by super storms. Referring to the loss of lives in UP due to the calamity,   had tweeted, “My heartfelt condolences to the families who have lost their loved ones. I am sorry your CM is needed here in Karnataka. I am sure he will return soon and attend to his work there.”
 
 SP chief   had tweeted, “He has been elected to solve the problems of UP, and not to get involved with Karnataka politics. If he does not return even under these circumstances, he should make his Math in Karnataka.”
 
 
  
  
 
 However, the CM’s office said Yogi’s change in schedule had nothing to do with the opposition’s comments as more than 90% of the relief work had been completed by Thursday night itself.
 
 Sources said the CM will return to Karnataka on Saturday evening or Sunday morning and will campaign there for the next three to four days.
