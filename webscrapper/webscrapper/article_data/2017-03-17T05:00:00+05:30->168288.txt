The 20-year-old has been roped in to play Naga Shourya’s love interest in an upcoming rom-com directed by Venky, a debutant. “I have been getting a lot of offers from Tollywood but couldn’t take them up as my hands were full with Kannada projects. In fact, the filmmakers met my parents and narrated the script of the film. They loved it and felt I must do the film. It’s a fun rom-com and I did not have to think much before giving it a nod,” says the actress, who has projects with Kannada stars like  , Ganesh and Darshan lined up.
Talking about her role, the Bangalore girl says, “This is a proper rom-com and you’ll see   and me play very bubbly and fun characters. I cannot reveal more about the film or my role right now as the film’s shoot is scheduled to kick off in June.”
 That’s not all though. The actress is also in contention to act in Prabhas’ next as well. “Yes, the makers did approach me. But we are still in talks; nothing has been finalised yet. I have committed my dates to two Kannada films right now so it’s too premature 
 to talk about anything else,” says Rashmika, who is hoping to brush up her Telugu speaking skills soon. “I cannot speak Telugu; I can understand just a few words. Once I get the script, I’ll start practising my lines in Telugu and I think I can manage if I dedicate some time to it,” she says, signing off.
