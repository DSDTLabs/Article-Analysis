KOCHI: Political tensions at the Raj Bhavan in Chennai was reflected in equal measure nearly 700 km away at Vathuruthy, Kochi's largest Tamil settlement as Edappadi K Palaniswami's government in Tamil Nadu won the   on Saturday. 

  was busy trying to calm his neighbour,  , who was furious at the  . "Nobody voted for V K Sasikala or Palaniswami, we voted for Amma (late  )," said C Palaniswami. Few residents of Vathuruthy had gathered at Pichapandian's house to watch the news as they came back from work around 5 pm. 
 
 "Either they should make O Panneerselvam the CM or conduct another election," said AIADMK supporter, C Palaniswami, whose opinion was shared by several others in Vathuruthy. "Palaniswami, who has been elected CM, was never in the political picture and Sasikala has been there for the all the wrong reasons," said S Thangamani, who has been working in Kochi for the past 10 years. Not everyone in Vathuruthy is lucky enough to have a TV or to have a neighbour that owns a television set. "Our landlord allows us to use a common TV set at 7 pm for, a few hours, so we get our news mostly via word of mouth or newspapers," said M Mutheswaran, a BCom graduate who moved from Theni to Kochi 15 days ago. Most Tamils in Vathuruthy aged between 20 and 30 were not inclined to having either Palaniswami or Panneerselvam as their CM. "It does not matter. The MLA's are supposed to represent our interest but at the end of the day, they won't allow government to do any good for the poor," said A Venkateshan, a 25-year-old from Viluppuram.
 
 There were also a few Tamils in Vathuruthy, who had stayed long enough in Kochi, to allow the local influences to seep in. "We identify with the CITU, but that has no value in our home town and here, we have to keep it a secret or else nobody will hire us," said Pichapandian, who moved from Dindigul to Kochi around 30 years ago.
