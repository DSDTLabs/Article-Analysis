NAVI MUMBAI: Bhushan Gagrani, managing director of  , said on Thursday that the planning body was willing to act as a ‘facilitator’ for infrastructure development in   project, if it gets a feasible scheme. Gagrani was replying to queries raised by the audience at a seminar on the prospects of   and  . 

 The event, attended by builders and citizens, was organized by Navi Mumbai Press Club at Cidco Exhibition Centre. 
 
 A builder pointed out that the project has already been delayed by four years and land acquisitions were yet to be completed. But Gagrani clarified that Cidco only proposed the project concept four years ago but the infra development plan was approved by the state 2 months ago. “Hence, it is not fair to blame Cidco for the delay in implementing the project,” he added.
 
 Cidco joint MD Prajakta Verma said that land pooling and acquisition are intertwined and so infrastructure development would be sporadic.
 
 Gagrani elaborated that for Naina to become a reality the villagers, whose land come under the project, need to form groups and submit their collective land to Cidco. 
 
 “If land pooling concept does not work, then Cidco has no other option but to go for acquisition, which is a time-consuming task, as   have to be convinced, which escalates the project cost,” he added.
