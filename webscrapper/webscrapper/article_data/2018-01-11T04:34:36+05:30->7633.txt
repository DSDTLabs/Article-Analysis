KOLKATA: The city is experiencing its longest cold spell since 2004. With the minimum temperature remaining 10.9°C on Wednesday, it turned out to be the sixth consecutive day of sub-12°C in Kolkata. 

 The last time the city had seen a longer   spell was 14 years ago, when the mercury had remained below 12°C for 12 days. “In 2004, there had been a break in between when the mercury crossed 12°C. The year before, however, had seen a continuous spell. This time, it doesn’t seem likely that the record will be broken. On Friday, we expect the mercury to rise by a degree. 
 
 Even though the cold spell will last at least till January 14, the mercury could rise after that,” said  , director,   ( ). With the northwesterly maintaining its intensity, the chill remained sharp on Wednesday. It could be the same on Thursday as well with no change predicted in the wind pattern. “From Friday, the northwesterly could lose its intensity a shade, triggering a rise in temperature. But it won’t be a sharp rise. The chill will persist. 
 
 We expect the minimum temperature to be around 2°C below normal,” added Das. The northwesterly wind has been blowing in at a speed of 10-15 km/hr.
