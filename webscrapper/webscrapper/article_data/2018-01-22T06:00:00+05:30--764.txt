 and Sikander Darediaâ€™s anniversary party was high on   oomph. The couple, who celebrated their 15th wedding anniversary, threw a lavish bash for around 250 people, who turned up dressed to the hilt and showered them with warm wishes. While the live band Herfunmola, flown in especially from Delhi for this shindig, kept things lively with some Bollywood tunes, the guests got into an impromptu jig. Adding to the oomph was   who upped the glam quotient of the bash with her presence. The actress was the cynosure of all eyes as she shook a leg with the couple. The guests were treated to Indian and Italian delicacies and classic cocktails at what was one helluva party!
