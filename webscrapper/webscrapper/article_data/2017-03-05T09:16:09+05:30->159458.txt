PATNA: The BJP on Saturday launched statewide agitation demanding ouster of prohibition, excise and registration department minister   from the   government for his alleged derogatory remarks against Prime Minister  . The BJP-led NDA has so far disrupted the state legislature proceedings during the ongoing Budget session over the issue.

 Mastan allegedly asked a crowd at a public meeting in his Amour constituency on February 22 to beat PM Modi’s photo with shoes as a protest against the demonetisation.
 
 Addressing a dharna at   in Patna, BJP state president Nityanand Rai said, “Mastan’s action is unpardonable. The BJP will not pardon him despite his apology and regrets expressed by chief minister Nitish Kumar, RJD chief Lalu Prasad and   president Ashok Choudhary. We will continue protesting until the state government removes Mastan.”
 
 Other BJP legislators who addressed the dharna included   Nitin Navin, who has also lodged an FIR against Mastan with Kotwali police station in Patna. He has levelled sedition charges against Mastan. Navin has sought the minister’s arrest for disturbing communal harmony and also challenged his citizenship, alleging that he hailed from an area bordering Bangladesh. Similar dharnas were organized at other district headquarters, including at Muzaffarpur, Samastipur and Bhagalpur.
 
 The row over Mastan started after the video clips of his Amour meeting went viral on February 28. In the video, Mastan is shown provoking a crowd to hurl shoes at PM Modi’s photo.
 
 The NDA members have created uproar in the state assembly as well as council over the last three days. They also submitted a memorandum to governor Ram Nath Kovind on March 2 demanding Mastan’s removal from the cabinet.
