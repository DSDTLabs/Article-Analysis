MUMBAI: Class X students who will be applying to first year junior college ( ) for 2017-18 can expect chaos as the process undergoes major changes. The education department which has already begun ground work is yet unsure about several changes that have been announced over the past year.

 Education officials said that new rules which grant additional marks in board exams for students excelling in cultural activities could result in students getting a double advantage as there is already a quota during the  . Similar is the case for students excelling in sports. “Students are getting extra marks in the exams and also getting a reservation during admission. The state needs to clarify whether this is acceptable,” said an official. Out of the total FYJC seats, 2% are reserved for students who excel in arts and culture and 3% seats are reserved for sportspersons.
 
 Officials said that the because of the new process which includes setting up a new website through a Noida based company and extending the process to other parts of the state, students might have to cough up a higher fee during the admissions. “This year, the information booklet might be split into two parts to include local variations in the process. Additionally students will be filling up new options for each round. All this put together, students might have to pay higher fees for the online process,” said the official. Until last year, students had to shell out Rs 150 at the beginning of the process which gave them an information booklet, a user Id and password.
 
 Chaos is also expected because the students will no longer have the betterment option. “A lot of students seek provisional admission and wait for a better choice of college but this time they will not get that chance. This might not go down well with parents and students,” he said. Meanwhile, activists who moved the   against the process last year claimed that the state’s audit of the online admissions was not sufficient to plug the problems. “The state has not published the report in public domain. The report only collates the data but doesn’t point out the mistakes and hold anyone responsible,” said  , System Correcting Movement (SYSCOM).
