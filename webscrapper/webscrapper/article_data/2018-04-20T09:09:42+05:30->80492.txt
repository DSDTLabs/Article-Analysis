TAMLUK: A schoolteacher was sentenced to death by the   court on Thursday, a day after he was convicted for the 2012 rape and murder of a child who worked as a maid in his house. Justice Sanchita Sarkar, second additional sessions and district judge, sentenced Pranab Roy (44) at Calcutta High Court. Death sentences have to be ratified by the HC.

 The 12-year-old victim worked in Roy’s house for a year. Roy, a father of two, was accused of repeatedly raping the girl whenever his wife and children were out of their house in Tamluk town’s Nimtala. On May 23, 2012 neighbours found the girl writhing in pain on Roy’s balcony. She was also frothing from the mouth. They rushed her to a Tamluk hospital, where she died within an hour. An FIR was lodged on June 2, 2012 followed by Roy’s arrest. He, however, got bail after 84 days in custody.
 
  
 Roy, considered close to Trinamool, claimed in his police statement that the victim committed suicide. But the autopsy report by surgeon Pradip Das said the girl had been repeatedly raped. TOI had reported in June 6, 2012 how alleged   goons attacked Das’s house after this report. But Das, who conducted autopsies on victims of the 2007 Nandigram killings, refused to alter his report, which was crucial for the prosecution.
 
 Members of women’s groups and other organisations demonstrated outside the court. Later, the SUCI women’s wing took out a victory rally.
 
 Public prosecutor   said, “Roy was convicted under   sections 302 and 376 and Section 14 of Pocso Act. We had appealed for exemplary and stringent punishment for the guilty.”
 
 Roy’s son recently became a doctor after completing his MBBS studies while his daughter — an MA in English —earned her BEd degree.
