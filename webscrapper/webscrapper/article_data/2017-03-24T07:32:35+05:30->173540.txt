JALANDHAR: On Thursday, SAD president   accused the Congress government of going back on its pre-poll promise of complete loan waiver for farmers within one week of taking over the administration.

 “They even got loan waiver forms filled by farmers. But if they could not do anything on their own, then why did they make the promise,” he said while speaking to newspersons. He was here to pay tributes to Bhagat Singh Rajguru and Sukhdev on the martyrs’ memorial.
 
 “Chief minister Captain   met the Prime Minister and requested for a loan waiver package for the state. This is exactly what we were striving for. If the   had to request the PM for a loan waiver why did it deceive the people and led them to believe that the waiver would be done by the state government,” he said.
 
 He alleged all development works had halted after the Congress government took over the reins of the state. “We want them to beat us in development,” he said.
 
 Former deputy CM also said he would give six months to the state government to perform before criticizing it. “Let them show their performance,” he said.
 
 Asked about Navjot Singh Sidhu’s comments that he would participate in the TV comedy show as he did not own any transport business, Sukhbir said he would not comment. “He should bother about his own work and why should he bother about me. His is a legal issue and if law permits then there should be no issue,” he said.
 
 
 
 
 While responding to a query that there were reports that old cable operators had started taking control of Fastway Cable Network at places, Sukhbir said that he was not aware of that. “The cable network is not illegal and rather it is controlled by the government of India’s act. If they want to start vendetta as they have started registering cases, there are instances of the Congress people taking possession of truck unions and what difference they stand to show,” he said.
