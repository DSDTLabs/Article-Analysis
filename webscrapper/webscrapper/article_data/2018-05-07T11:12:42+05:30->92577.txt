PANAJI: Sweepers burning plastic on the eastern fringe of   (GU) campus triggered a grass fire that left a large stretch of the landscape burnt and scores of trees singed by the blaze on Friday afternoon.

 A few establishments, including a health centre and a bank, are located in the area. Sources said that the sweepers from one of them lit the fire to piles of plastic. After some time, it went out of control and spread to the dry grass, and kept spreading into the campus area. 
 
 “About a hectare of the open landscape along the road was burnt,” a source said.
 
 A few fruit trees like tamarind as also copper pod were burnt. Many trees in the campus were planted through a couple of initiatives some years back, the source said.
 
 Fires in the campus have been reported in the past, as the road passing through it is a busy thoroughfare, from   to densely populated Dona Paula, Taleigao and  . 
 
 The public works department (PWD) broadened the existing major district road into a six-km four-lane about four years back. 
 
 Academics in the 170-hectare GU campus had expressed concern about it, but the project was later completed. Hundreds of trees were axed.
 
 With an increase in density of traffic, some anti-social elements pose a problem to the quiet ambience of the campus. “The sanctity of the campus is important, as many departments are located here,” an official said.
 
 On Friday, the fire did the damage, as it slowly died out. “We did not receive any call about it,” a source in fire and emergency services department said.
