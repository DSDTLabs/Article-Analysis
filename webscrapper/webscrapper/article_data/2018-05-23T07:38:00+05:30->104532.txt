Amritsar: Pakistan’s first Sikh police officer, Gulab Singh, has approached a court in Lahore, challenging a bid by the neighbouring country’s minority body — the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) — to sell a part of land of the city’s historical Bebe Nanki Gurdwara.

 In his petition filed against ETPB and Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC), Gulab has claimed that officials of two bodies had been collecting donations in the name of Sikh shrines, but not doing anything to restore or maintain them. “ETPB tried to sell land of Bebe Nanki Gurdwara in Dera Chahal. Tara and an Indian Sikh fugitive, who lives in Pakistan, collected around Rs 10 crore to Rs 15 crore from Sikhs living in the US, UK and Canada from Sikhs living in the US, UK and Canada on the pretext of developing the shrine. But they didn’t spend a single penny on it,” he has said in the lawsuit.
 
 In February, the neighbouring country’s Supreme Court held a former chairman of EPTB, Syed Asif Hashmi, responsible for illegally selling around 800 acres of the 1,200 acres of Bebe Nanki Gurdwara for the construction of a residential colony.
 
 Gulab has also accused deputy administrator and assistant administrator of ETPB of forcibly taking control of the gurdwara property. Formed in 1960, ETPB is a statutory government body, which administers evacuee properties of Sikhs and Hindus left in Pakistan after the Partition.
 
 PSGPC works under the direct control of ETPB, once headed by former ISI chief Javed Nasir. In the past, Gulab’s wife Paramjit Kaur was attacked by a few Khalistani Sikhs taking shelter in Pakistan for raising his voice against ETPB and PSGPC.
