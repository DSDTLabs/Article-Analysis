BENGALURU: Congress president   is said to have conveyed once again to Karnataka chief minister   not to play with people’s emotions by using terminologies like “terrorist” to address “adversaries” like the BJP and the RSS.

 However, within minutes after the meeting ended on Saturday, Siddaramaiah told reporters that the Karnataka elections are neither a fight between himself and B S Yeddyurappa nor between himself and Prime Minister   “It’s going to be between the ideologies of secularism and communalism,” he claimed.
 
 Earlier in the day, Rahul held separate meetings with Siddaramaiah and Karnataka Pradesh   (KPCC) president G Parameshwara.
 
 Rahul and the high command urged Siddaramaiah to focus on reaching to the masses with development agenda rather than get diverted by using words like “terrorists” while addressing the party’s rivals.
 
 Siddaramaiah told the media that he had not used the word “terrorist” and that it was only meant to convey that there are Hindu hardliners in the BJP and RSS.
 
 Three All India Congress committee (AICC) teams will arrive in Karnataka shortly to manage the party’s social media and conventional media campaigns and for formulating strategy ahead of the elections. Rahul will attend two rallies — addressing dalits and farmers —between February 10 and 12. He will hold meet the office bearers on the last day.
