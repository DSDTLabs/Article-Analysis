DUBAI: The colours of  's athleisure gear summed up the dank, dismal Sunday weather on the eve of the   tennis championships, an ATP 500 Series event. The Bulgarian top seed, who is recovering from a cold, however, looked at the brighter side of things, saying big performances often come out of smaller fields with fewer top ranked players.

 
 "These kinds of draws create big opportunities for everyone to do better, to push themselves," the stylish pro said. "Anyone can come out and play unbelievable. Maybe it's their day, they can just produce a different level of tennis. Also, players have nothing to lose when they play against a higher seed. They're a bit more free-swinging. That's why you have to be ready. You should never underestimate any opponent you play."
 
 The 26-year-old world No. 4, looking for his first title of the year, added: "One of the most important things for me has been to really focus on myself. I want to be better with each match, every tournament. This is the key for me."
 
 Dimitrov, who ended last season at a career high No. 3, said the title in the ATP Finals in London last November gave him fresh perspective. "It's a great memory, something nice to feed off. I'm trying to be very positive and good. Everything in life goes through ups and downs. I just don't want to be too high or too low after that kind of success. When I started this year, I already had different goals, different mindset."
