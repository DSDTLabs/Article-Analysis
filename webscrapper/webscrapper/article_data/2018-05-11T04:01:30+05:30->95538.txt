MUMBAI: The sessions court has absolved former Shiv Sena legislator   of molestation and harassment charges levelled against him by his party colleague and Dahisar corporator Sheetal Mhatre. 

  Pointing out that Mhatre kept "improving" her statements which were not subsequently corroborated by witnesses, additional sessions court judge F M   said charges against Ghosalkar appeared to be concocted. It appeared that Ghosalkar had been implicated in the case out of political grudge and rivalry, judge Khwaja noted. Mhatre had accused Ghosalkar in January 2014 of having got her mobile phone number scribbled on the walls of several public places in Dahisar, and of issuing a death threat to her. She was backed by former city mayor   and BJP   from Dahisar Manisha Chaudhary in the BMC general body meeting held soon after.
 
 The incident sent shock waves through the Sena and party president   stripped Ghosalkar of his vibhag pramukh portfolio in an attempt to placate Mhatre. Ghosalkar firmly controlled the party's organisational set-up in the Borivli-Dahisar stretch for over two decades. The Borivli court ordered last year that charges be framed against Ghosalkar. Ghosalkar later contested the Borivli court order in the sessions court.
