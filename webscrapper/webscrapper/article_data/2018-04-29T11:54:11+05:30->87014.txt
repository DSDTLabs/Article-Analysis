VIJAYAWADA: In what is being billed as a tit-for-tat meeting, the TDP is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that the massive public meeting to be addressed by party president and Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu   in Tirupati on Monday reaches the maximum audience.

 Hitting back at   president   and Prime Minister   soon after the TDP ended its political alliance with the Centre, Naidu had vowed to hold a series of public meetings to ‘expose’ the betrayal done by PM Modi to   on granting Special Category Status (SCS). Accordingly, the first such public meeting is to be held at Tirupati on Monday.
 
 The public meeting will be held at Sri Venkateswara University Grounds, the same location from where then prime ministerial candidate Modi had addressed a gathering four years ago. The timing of Monday’s meeting too coincides with Modi’s meeting that had taken place on April 30, 2014. The hallmark of Naidu’s meeting would be playing the video clips of Modi’s speech delivered in Hindi, which was translated into Telugu by then BJP leader and now vice president of India M  .
 
 In the video, Modi promises Special Category Status for AP. Naidu is also slated to replay the speech delivered by Modi during the foundation laying ceremony for Amaravati on October 22, 2015, in which he promises to provide enough funding for the new AP capital to make it greater than the national capital New Delhi.
 
 The Tirupati meeting has been named Dharma Porata Sadassu (Meeting Seeking Justice). Ministers K Atchannaidu and N Amaranth Reddy are camping in Tirupati to monitor the arrangements and people are being mobilised from all 13 districts to make it a resounding success.
