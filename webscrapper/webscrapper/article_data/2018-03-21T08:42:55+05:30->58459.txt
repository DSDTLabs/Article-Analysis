I feel sad for  . The women’s singles semifinal at the   Championships against Japan’s   was a wonderful match.   played similar matches in the earlier rounds too, stretching to three games. It is obvious she is being drawn into it by players such as   and Yamaguchi.

 
 
 
 Being defensive players, Okuhara and Yamaguchi are good at running, retrieving and dishing out one rally after another. They have worked this plan to perfection and Sindhu invariably falls into the trap whenever they prolong the rallies.
 
 
 
 
 
 She plays well at the net but when players push the shuttle to the back of the court, all she does is either clear it or hit very hard. She has to take advantage of her height and reach a little more and play shots judiciously. 
 
 
 
 She must develop deceptive, faster clears, sharp drop shots and clips to pin the shuttle down. She also has to work on the deceptive half smashes on the run to the back. Sindhu has a bigger hit than other girls but it can fetch points only when she finds the lines consistently. She will be more effective and efficient against these defensive girls only if she works out a fine combination of these strokes.
 
 Contrary to popular belief, Sindhu doesn’t tire out after a rally. She is extremely fit and is capable of recovering after every rally. But she has to learn to conserve her energy. On most occasions, she will be able to win in two games against them.
 
 Sindhu also has to guard against two big pitfalls. One is pace. All retrievers like fast games. The more you hit the more they put the shuttle back in court. She can upset the rhythm of these girls by varying the pace. The other is the lapse in concentration once she is on top. Sindhu yields easy points trying to force the issue and has lost many matches when she is up by a few points. This too needs to be curbed.
