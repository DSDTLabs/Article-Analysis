CHANDIGARH: A slender motorcycle will go ahead of a bulky bowser to douse the flames. In narrow lanes and heavy traffic especially, it might save up to 10 minutes of reaction time, claimed the municipal commissioner here on Saturday, as the force remembered its martyrs at the start of the fire services week.

 Municipal commissioner Jitender   joined mayor   in laying wreaths against the martyrs’ column of the Sector-17 fire station. Addressing firemen, Yadav said it was important to recognise their sacrifices and promote fire safety. He promised special fire-safety campaigns and drills in schools for orderly evacuation in case of natural and manmade disasters, besides giving people the knowledge of using fire extinguishers. The newly inducted fire bikes he talked about can carry medical supplies, simple extinguishers, and jet guns with hose rigs.
 
 The mayor sought citizen support for all the fire-safety programmes to be conducted from April 14 to 20. He said: “Every citizen should know about operating fire extinguishers. People should adopt safe housekeeping practices and keep only approved electrical appliances. Rather than a week’s exercise, make it a regular mock drill. Pray for all the departed fire fighters. Only the fortunate get to lead and training this force.”
 
 The gathering observed a two-minute silence in the memory of all the firemen lost in saving lives. The mayor recalled their bravery during some of the mission in Chandigarh. He appreciated the firemen who had been honoured for distinguished and meritorious service. The programme included a mock fire drill for different emergencies. The gathering saw a hydraulic turn-table ladder in action.
