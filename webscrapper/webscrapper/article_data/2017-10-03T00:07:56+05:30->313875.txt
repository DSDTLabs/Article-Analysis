Hyderabad: In a befitting answer to the critics of the government, the TRS government has completed distribution of 23.80 lakh sheep among Golla-Kuruma communities in the state. This was disclosed by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Monday.

 The CM made these remarks in front of a gathering of delegates from all over the country, who had come to participate in the All India Kurumas Conference. The delegation met the CM at Pragati Bhavan and congratulated him for implementing the innovative sheep distribution schemes for the welfare and development of Golla Kuruma communities.
 
 Those who met the CM included Karnataka transport minister Revanna, Maharashtra ministers Mahadev Jankar, Ram Shinde, former minister of Karnatka Bandhappa, Karimnagar Zilla Parishad chairperson Tula Uma and others. The delegation expressed happiness and congratulated the CM for initiating several programmes and schemes for the upliftment of their community and other backward classes.
 
 The CM announced the grant of 10 acres of land for the construction of Golla Kuruma Hostel and Rs 10 crore funds for the same. 
 
 Explaining about the sheep distribution scheme, the CM said that there are about 35 to 40 lakh members of the Yadav community who rear sheep, but yet the state imports 650 truckloads of meat. Hyderabad alone imports 350 truckloads of meat on a daily basis. It was to reverse this process that the scheme worth Rs 4,500 crore was planned. As part of the plan, it has been decided to distribute 84 lakh sheep in the state in the next two years. So far 23.80 lakh sheep have been distributed.
