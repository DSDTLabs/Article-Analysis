 With only three of the 14 minors having brought back with the help of cops so far, the home authorities are now trying to reach out to the police departments of other states such like  , Odisha and Chattishgarh to trace the missing minors, who may be trying to return to their native places.
 
 Sources in the observation home stated that letters have been written to the police stations concerned and family members of the missing minors residing within their limits. The minors belonged to the category of children in need of care and protection.
 
 Meanwhile, department is also expediting the process of getting CCTV cameras installed. In Nagpur, there are eight homes, including five at Patankar chowk, operating under women and child development department.
 
 District women and child development officer   Pardeshi said that Karuna home for rescued women already has CCTV cameras, while the work would initiate at the home, from where the minors escaped, within a month. “The grant for developing the condition of homes have already reached the collector’s office. We are set to get the funds to begin various works,” he said.
 
 Pardeshi said that an enquiry will be carried out to fix the responsibility of serious lapse of duty, which led to escaping of the minors. 
 
 “A notice has been issued to the caretaker who was probably sleeping, as he failed to hear even the slightest of sound when 14 inmates were breaking locks and fleeing. Once we get a nod from the higher-ups, we would conduct a detailed enquiry to ensure that no one is spared this time,” he said.
