TRICHY: The   Junction railway station is lacking basic amenities like drinking water, unhygienic conditions, improper maintenance, said chairman of Southern Railway’s   Amenity Committee (PAC), H Raja after inspecting the station along with the committee members here on Thursday. Necessary facilities would be established in all the stations falling under Trichy railway division, the committee assured.

 The team inspected every nook and corner of the station including platforms, subway, water taps, washrooms, refreshment stalls and waiting halls. The team also inspected the coaches of the Trichy – Manamadurai and Trichy – Cuddalore Port passenger trains which were stationed there. They inquired with the passengers about the amenities at the station.
 
 Speaking to reporters, Raja said that his team noticed some basic amenities like potable drinking water lacking in the station. He also said that the coaches were badly maintained. “We will discuss the flaws noticed at the meeting and would instruct the officials for necessary action,” Raja said . 
 
 During the committee meeting held at the divisional office, chaired by Raja, the members came down heavily on the concerned officials from the division for the recent hike in platform ticket to Rs 20 from Rs 10.
 
 Meanwhile, on behalf of the  , a charter of demands was handed over to the committee which included up gradation of Trichy Junction to A1 category, revoking the hike in platform ticket to Rs 10, early completion of foot over bridge at the station, intercity and overnight trains between Trichy and Bengaluru.
 
 Despite Trichy contributing more to long distance trains from the south, the quota for the city was very meagre. So, Trichy should be included in general quota for all long distance trains; extend trains halting at Chennai suburbs to Trichy as there is sufficient space for maintaining and halting the locos here and providing required land for speeding up the ongoing Aristo flyover in the city.
