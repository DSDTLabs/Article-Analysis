PUNE: For the first time,  , a 28-year-old transgender, will get the chance to exercise his right to franchise in the upcoming civic polls. 

 To claim his right as a third gender, Rahul had to run from pillar to post for more than a year when his voting card identified him as ‘male’ despite applying for correction in the voting list for identifying him as ‘other’.
 
 “Despite court orders, the ward office or the Pune zilla parishad (ZP) office refused to make the change. I would run from the ward office to ZP office and back. Despite making several rounds, the list had mentioned my gender as ‘male’ twice. But I did not lose hope and carried all court documents with me, until finally on Tuesday, the final voting list included me in the ‘other’ category.”
 
 During the   elections next month, as many as 70 transgenders would be queuing up outside polling booths to exercise their right to vote as third gender. Earlier, they would enlist themselves as male or female in official documents. 
 
 Of the 26.31 lakh registered voters in Pune, the number of transgenders registered is, however, small. Activists feel lack of documents, especially for outsiders, and social issues prevent them from coming out in the open. 
 
 Ward number 37, the   area, registered the highest number of transgenders with 15, followed by Market Yard and lower Indiranagar, ward number 36, with 12 registrations. Officers at the election commission said the community is opening up gradually as social acceptance increases. Transgender activists claimed that there were close to 300 of them in the city but several issues plagued them while registering in the voters list.
 
 Activist   said, “Many of these 300 transgenders are migrants to the city and producing the documents for address proof is often a hurdle. They do not have permanent residences. Some live in rented homes and landlords are reluctant to get into any official agreement, which means they cannot submit proof of residence.”
