VIJAYAWADA: Union minister of state for science and technology,   Chowdary on Tuesday met Prime Minister   in Parliament and discussed the issue of meagre allocation for   in the Union budget, an issue on which the TDP has been staging protests over the last few days.

 In a 30-minutes-long meet, Sujana told   that the TDP has been honouring ‘coalition dharma’ but because of the several issues on which the Centre has not acted upon, there is growing unrest in AP. Sources said the Union minister brought to the notice of the PM the promises made in the AP Reorganisation Act like special category status, a separate railway zone with Vizag as the headquarters, Dugarajapatnam port and allocations for Amaravati.
 
 In response, the Prime Minister told the Union minister that, “the question of special status is not only limited to AP, it also involves others states. We are trying to pool in funds from various other sources for AP’s development. Moreover, for the completion of the Polavaram project, we are allocating funds through NABARD. Similarly, for the capital construction, the Centre is ready to allocate funds whenever required. There is absolutely no need to be worried.” Modi also reportedly assured Sujana that he would soon speak to chief minister Chandrababu Naidu.
 
 Meanwhile, the TDP coordination committee met under the leadership of Naidu in Vijayawada. Back in Delhi, TDP MPs continued with their protests in Parliament for the second day on Tuesday. YSR   and Congress MPs also joined the protest in both the Houses.
