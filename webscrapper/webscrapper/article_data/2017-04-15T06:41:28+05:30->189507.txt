AHMEDABAD: On February 14, when the country’s drug pricing authority put a cap on cardiac stent prices, slashing rates by over 75%, 20 hospitals in Gujarat did not pass on the benefit to patients. 

 In one of its first such crackdowns, Gujarat’s food and drug commisonerate asked these 20 leading hospitals to refund the extra amount to the patient with immediate effect. 
 
 The extra money amounts to Rs 52 lakh, to be paid to some 80 patients. Food and drug commissioner HG Koshia said some 120 cardiac stents were implanted in these 80 patients.
 
 Koshia says that after the   (NPPA) slashed prices of coronary stents by over 75%, heart patients would pay between Rs 75,000 and Rs 1 lakh less. 
 
 The notification capped ceiling prices of drug eluting stents (DES) and bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) at Rs 29,600, and bare metal stents ( ) at Rs 7,260. 
 
 If one includes VAT, these stents would Rs 31,080 and Rs 7,623, respectively. “We found that in certain cases, doctors had implanted multiple stents in a single patient,” says Koshia. 
 
 The Gujarat   team visited these hospitals and inspected the accounts, receipt books and patient records of the cardiology department.
 
 A senior FDCA official told TOI, “Most stents were sold at profit margins between 275% and 400%. Most of the records revealed a large number of DESes, which were sold at an average price above Rs 1 lakh, while BMS were sold an average price of Rs 47,065,”. 
 
 The official added, “If a patient discovers that the hospital is charging extra on cardiac stents, they can inform us or simply email us and we will help,” an FDCA official said.
