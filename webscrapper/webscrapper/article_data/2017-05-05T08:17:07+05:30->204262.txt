LUCKNOW: While PM   is extending a helping hand to UP to get maximum benefit from the  , the Union government is yet to concede to the state’s demand to release some   officers it wanted back.

 It’s reported that chief minister Yogi Adityanath had sought repatriation of nine officers, who are serving at the  , for serving in the state. The list of officers included Devesh Chaturvedi, Alok Tandon, Anurag Srivastav, Sanjay Bhoosreddy, Narendra Bhushan, Alok Kumar and Prashant Trivedi.
 
 It is over a fortnight now since the request was sent, but there is no response from the department of personnel and training (DoPT) of the Government of India, say a senior officer in the state’s appointment department describing it ‘intriguing’ and ‘unusual’, particularly when the political complexion of the two governments is the same.
 
 Earlier, when senior IAS officer Awanish Awasthi came back from the Central deputation, it was speculated that he would take over as the principal secretary to the CM. It was said that Yogi himself wanted him as Awasthi had served as the Gorakhpur DM in the past. However, he was given other departments and the CM continues to be without a principal secretary.
