BERHAMPUR: The Rs 1.15-crore funds sanctioned by the tourism department for   development of Maa Budhi Thakurani temple two years ago is yet to be spent by the   (OTDC) that is supposed to execute the work. The temple is the epicentre of the biennial Thakurani Yatra that the   is famous for. 

 The amount was meant for a gate, public centre and toilet facilities. Besides, lighting, drinking water and parking facilities would also be developed near the temple located in the heart of the town. People from far-off places visit the temple every day and the numbers surge on Sankranti and every Tuesday in the month of Chaitra. The district administration took more than half acre of land near the temple from the temple trust and handed it over to OTDC in May last year for the work. Though tender has already been finalized, work could not start due to encroachment near the temple site, said an engineer of the corporation. "We have taken up the matter with the district collector. But the area was not free of encroachment," said OTDC superintendent engineer S Chakraborty. He said they were trying to start the work as soon as possible. More people will visit the temple once the infrastructure gets a boost, said MLA (Berhampur) R C Chyaupatnaik. He urged the government to accord the state-level festival tag to the famous Thakurani Yatra that is now underway. 
 
 The festival marks the visit of the goddess to her father's house in  . This year, some Italians visited the festival site.
