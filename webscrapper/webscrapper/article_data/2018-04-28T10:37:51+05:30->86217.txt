DHARAMSHALA: Five persons allegedly raped a 15-year-old girl, who was returning from a temple located in an interior village at Palampur division in   on Thursday noon. 

 Palampur police received a complaint in this regard on Friday.
 
 Superintendent of police Santosh Patial said the girl, a student of Class XI, had gone to a temple with a 21-year-old relative. They were returning on a bike when the incident took place.
 
 "According to the girl, they stopped to take a break while returning from the temple. Both were sitting across the road where a group of five persons thrashed the boy and took the girl to an isolated place and committed the crime. We have got very vital clues in this case and will arrest the accused soon," he said.
 
 Police did not confirm that how many persons committed rape. Police said the rape survivor revealed the incident to her parents on Thursday evening after returning home. But it was some social worker who convinced the family to report the matter to the police.
 
 "Medical examination of the girl has been conducted and we are waiting for the report," said Patial.
 
 The temple where she had been with her relative was located about 6kms from the main road. It was connected with a link road. But there was a forest area in between where the incident allegedly took place, police said.
 
 Besides forensic experts examining the spot, other senior officials also visited the police station concerned on Friday. Police questioned the relative of the girl. Patial said the accused were suspected to be locals.
 
 Police sources said the accused committed the crime under the influence of liquor. A case has been registered under relevant sections of POCSO Act and IPC. A special team has been constituted to investigate the case. Notably, the state is still reeling under the effect of Kotkhai rape-murder case and investigations.
