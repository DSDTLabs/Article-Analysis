HYDERABAD: With her only son who went to Dubai having been reported missing, the distraught mother of the 20-year-old from Nizamabad district has been inconsolable and even refusing to eat. 

 All that the tribal woman Lali Bai of Megyanaik thanda, Gannaram village in Indalwai mandal of Nizamabad knows is that her son   had gone to Dubai to take up some work as life had become difficult for them due to financial problems. 
 
 Lali Bai's husband had died when Vinod was only five years old. Vinod, however, managed to study up to Class X but could not earn enough for both his mother and him to survive. 
 
 According to a relative  , the mother has been crying for the last 22 days for her son. When Santosh made enquires, he was told that after having gone to Dubai three months ago, Santosh left his employer due to some problems with him. Some workers from Nizamabad told Santosh that he was picked up by the police, probably because he had left the place of his legal employment. They are, however, not sure where he was taken.
 
 Vinod's passport and other legal documents are with the employer and therefore, he does not have any documents on him to seek help. 
 
 It is not known whether Vinod was taken and put in jail. If so in which jail in Dubai. Nizamabad MP   who was informed about Vinod going missing in Dubai, has asked Santosh to send her all the information about him. Meanwhile  , of Telangana who is currently in Dubai has contacted the Indian Embassy in Dubai for help in Vinod's case.
 
 In response, the embassy has asked for Vinod's details to make further enquiries. Santosh Lakavath has provided them the details.
