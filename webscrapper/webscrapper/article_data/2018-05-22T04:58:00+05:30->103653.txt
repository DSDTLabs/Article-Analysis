AHMEDABAD: A sessions court on Monday ordered 10 years rigorous imprisonment to Amrut  , an employee of a women’s shelter home — Paldi  , who had raped and impregnated a deaf-mute and mentally ill inmate.

  The court verdict relied on the DNA test which proved Patel was the father of the child the woman gave birth to, in January 2017.
 
 The continued sexual abuse of the 32-year-old inmate was exposed, when in August 2016 she was found five months pregnant. 
 
 Patel had contended that the deaf, mute and mentally-ill woman had engaged in consensual sex with him. 
 
 In his order, sessions court judge N P   also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the convict and the amount has been ordered to be given to the victim.
 
 The accused had sought acquittal on the ground that there was consent on part of the victim. But the argument was rejected even when he had sought bail. 
 
 If the accused had been granted bail, the victim and the institution would have lost faith in law, said public prosecutor Bharat Patni who had demanded stringent punishment for the accused.
 
 The court had then observed that the issue of consent from the victim is a subject matter of trial. But what was significant was the fact that the victim was in custody of the shelter home, where the accused was working.
 
 While sentencing Patel to rigorous imprisonment, the court observed that looking at the condition of the woman, and the facts that she is deaf, mute and psychologically disturbed, she falls in the most unprivileged class in society. Patel has also shamed the institution said the court. 
 
 Earlier, the management of the Vikas Gruh had approached   high court to seek permission to terminate the pregnancy of the rape survivor. But when the high court called the woman and asked her about her wish, she informed the court that she did not want an abortion.
