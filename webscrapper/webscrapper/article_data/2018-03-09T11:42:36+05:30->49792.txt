On the occasion of International Women’s Day yesterday on March 8, actor Dev announced his next productional venture at the music launch of his upcoming film ‘Kabir’. The actor will be producing a biopic on Padma Shri   Mistry.

 Subhasini was only 23 when she lost her husband, not to any disease but unfortunately to poverty. With four children to look after, she literally toiled for almost 20 years as a housemaid, a manual labourer and even a vegetable seller. Now at 70, Subhasini Mistry lives with great satisfaction as she sees a two-storied hospital she built for the poor in memories of her husband who lost his life due to lack of money for proper medical treatment.
 
 For her utmost dedication to do something for the society at several platforms, Subhasini was recently conferred India’s fourth-highest civilian award Padma Shri.
 
 This biopic, tentatively titled as ‘Padma Shri Subhasini Mistry’ will be directed by Aniket Chattopadhyay.
