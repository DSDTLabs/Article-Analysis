It’s her second outing on the small screen, which is why it took newbie   some time to digest the fact that she had been enlisted in a   production — Mane Devru — even though she had just debuted on television. 

 “I had, by then, wrapped  , my debut, in which I played a negative female lead. Not many offers came my way after that and I had decided to go back to my previous job in the IT sector. That’s when a friend suggested that I audition for Mane Devru as they were on the lookout for a fresh face. Frankly, I wasn’t aware of who was producing it and the big names that were associated with the project. Trishul, who is directing the serial, was also the one who auditioned me and promised to revert in case I had been cast. It so happened that another serial offer came my way at the same time. The next day,   called to tell me I was chosen. And when he mentioned that it was a Puneeth Rajkumar production, it sealed the deal for me. Who in their right mind would say no to a Puneeth venture?”
 
 The serial went on air in February this year. “I play Janaki, the female protagonist of the show,” says Archana, who adds, “From playing a role with negative shades to now essaying the role of a protagonist who champions women’s empowerment, it has been a huge turn around for me. Trishul had told me this would happen.” 
 
 Archana adds that the experience of shooting this soap has been extremely enriching because the theme propagates the idea of girls standing up for themselves and that she has gained plenty in the process. 
 
 
 
 Archana Laxminarasimhan shot with Puneeth Rajkumar for the promo of the show and came away bowled over by him. “I fell down while shooting for the promo and he was so concerned. I was touched,” she says.
