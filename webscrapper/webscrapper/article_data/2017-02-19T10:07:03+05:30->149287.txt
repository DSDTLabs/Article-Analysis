AHMEDABAD: Dr  , chief commissioner for persons with disabilities ( ) of Government of India concluded his two-day visit to Gujarat on Saturday with meeting with state’s chief secretary  . Talking to media, Pandey said that he discussed issues ranging from ST bus passes to regular meeting of the state-level committee with him and other senior government officials. “There is a state-level coordination committee chaired by the minister for social justice and empowerment. It should meet every six months. I got to know that in Gujarat the committee has not met after March 2016. Another issue that came to light was appointment of a full-time state-level commissioner for disabilities,” said Pandey.

 Other issues that came to light from the meeting with representatives of 22-odd NGOs and government officials in Gujarat included issuance of smartcards for the GSRTC pass holders with disabilities and appointment of special teachers or educators. “Several such posts are vacant and thus the work is done by teachers on contract. We have suggested to improve the situation. The central government provides funds for the same,” said Pandey.
 
 He lauded the state government’s initiative of issuing identity cards for disabled online. “But there is a long way to go. Against around 10.92 lakh persons with disabilities (PwD) , there are only 4.81 lakh certificates issued,” he said.
