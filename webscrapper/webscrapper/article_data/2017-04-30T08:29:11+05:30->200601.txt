Leena Zilpe Hate works to keep history alive. A conservator for National Research Laboratory for Conservation of Cultural Property (NRLC), which falls under  , she is currently working on conserving Babasaheb Ambedkar’s possessions for the museum dedicated to him in Chicholi, on Katol Road. In the past, she has also worked on projects to conserve Mahatma Gandhi’s objects, and more such works are on the anvil. 

 In an interview with TOI, she throws light on her body of work, conservation as a career, and more. Excerpts from the interview...
 
 Q.
 
 
 A. We have been given 173 objects to conserve, including newspapers, typewriter, belts, watches, nib pens, bags and more. Before this project, I didn’t know much about him. But his objects show how he lived a lavish lifestyle. His bags, caps, ties, socks tell us a lot about his personality. Not many know that he had artificial teeth, and he was more of a vegetarian. His manuscripts show how he was a brilliant thinker. He would play the sticks game.
 
 Q. 
 
 A. From 2008-2010, I was given the work of conserving Gandhiji’s objects. People usually think he was bald, but we got hair which was donated by his barber. We also preserved his Panchha, walking stick, blanket, jaapmala, sickle, tamba patra. His books told me that he was indeed a simple man, and his thoughts were his asset. His things show how we was truly an austere at heart, and down to earth. Not many people know that he used to practice chanting. We also found that he would clean his toilet, and cut vegetables from field with a sickle. His terracotta scrubber shows how much importance he gave to hygiene.
 
 Q.
 
 
 A. After Class 10, I didn’t want to study further, so I completed my Bachelors and Masters in applied art from Chitrakala Mahavidyalaya. I started developing interest in archaeology. I used to wonder things like, ‘What was the art scene before MF Hussain?’ So I studied Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology from Nagpur University in which Conservation was one of the topics. As new objects used to keep being discovered, I used to think how these articles need to be conserved so that our generation and that of future can learn about our heritage. I topped the paper of museology and took six months training at NRLC in Lucknow, a wing of ministry of culture. Under NRLC, we undertake conservation projects of different museums. I also received a scholarship from ministry of culture, and right now, I’m the only conservator in India with multi-disciplinary knowledge in ancient Indian history, linguistics and conservation of cultural heritage.
 
 Q.
 
 
 A. About three years ago, at the  , we restored VS Gaitonde’s abstract painting worth 20 crore, and even SH Raza’s paintings. We also put together a torn   from the period of the Bhosales in scroll format which was over 51 feet long, and the writing was extremely tiny. This was possible since I’m well versed in Sanskrit and other languages like Pali, Prakrit and Urdu. We restored old copies of Mahabharata, Rukmini Swayamvar and its likes. We also worked on the palm leaf paintings in the museum, fixed a cloth painting of Jhansi Rani on cloth, among others.
 
 Q. What are your future projects?
 
 A. Other than working for NRLC, I’ve independently started Hertiage Conservation Services since 2013. Not everyone can reach out to NRLC. And most people don’t know that things can be conserved. I want to appeal to the government to support me in conservation of objects before they are destroyed. The laboratory in Lucknow is burdened with projects, and it will help other states if government facilitates conservation in Nagpur, since it is in the centre of India. Soon enough, I’ll be travelling to Kolkata to work on Abdul Kalam’s objects, to Kashmir to work on paintings damaged by flood, and to Gujarat to work on Sardar Vallabhai Patel’s properties.
 
 Q.
 
 
 A. We follow the principle of minimum intervention. We don’t try to change the originality of the object; only the parts that are torn or damaged. The idea is to save its antique value, and not turn it into a new object. Every object has a different problem, and correct diagnosis is utmost important. By giving it a different treatment than required, one can end up spoiling it further. We also think of how durable the object will be, and in what condition, after about 50 years. In Rajasthan, a lot of faulty conservation takes place. Even those who are not trained in this take it up. It’s risky because if anything gets damaged, people will be at your throat.
