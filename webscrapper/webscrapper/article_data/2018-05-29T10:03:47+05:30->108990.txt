 “Many times, visitors pick up leaves and fruits lying in the garden and feed them to the animals. Now, in the wake of the Nipah virus alert in some states, we did not want to take any chances. This is why we released the advisory,” said Samanta, adding there were many fruit bats nesting in the zoo compound.
 
 “We have put up the notice at multiple places on the campus so that nobody tries to feed the animals fruit and leaves from the trees in the garden,” the director added.
 
 Every day, fruit and leaves from the trees are found strewn around on the ground. Several visitors accumulate them and try to feed the animals, said zoo sources.
 
 Zoo staff have also been instructed to clean the campus of fruit and leaves lying on the ground at regular intervals. “We are sweeping the place frequently to ensure there are no fruits strewn around,” said a member of the cleaning staff.
