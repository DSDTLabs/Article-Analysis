BENGALURU: The much-delayed Metro connectivity to   (KIA) got a push on Friday with Bengaluru development minister   seeking the Centre's help in deciding the route. George met Jayant Sinha, minister of state for civil aviation, and apprised him about the nine routes identified for the airport link. 

 Said BMRC MD  : "The state government will finalize the route and submit a detailed report along with the proposal on the most feasible one. The civil aviation ministry will play an important role, considering the airport comes under its jurisdiction. The BMRC and KIA have to collaborate in many ways to develop this project."
 
  Kharola said no route has been finalized yet. BMRC had earlier put out in public domain nine possible routes linking the city to the airport and had sought suggestions from citizens about the same. Of the lot, the Nagawara - Kannur - Bagalur - KIA route route was found to be the most feasible. This 27.8km corridor is an extension of Gottigere - Nagawara line via MG Road. As per a RITES report (RITES is a subsidiary company of the railways), it will take four years to build the line and the project will cost over Rs 5,100 crore. 
 
  BMRC is keen on innovative financing models to fund the corridor, including charging a premium floor space index for buildings that come within 500 metres of the Metro line. The rules for levying higher FSI are being worked out, said Kharola. Meanwhile, BMRC has begun work on the detailed project report for the Nagawara - Kannur - Bagalur line. tnn
