KOCHI: A 77-year-old man died on Thursday after he jumped off from the top floor of the Kerala   building.

 The incident happened around 12pm on Thursday. A member of the court staff saw the man, later identified as K L   of Mulavana in Kollam, going through the fire exit towards the edge of the building on the eighth floor. The court staff beckoned him not to, but the man took the leap.
 
 On the way down, his body hit the metal railing of the parapet above the portico. One of his arms got detached on the impact while a leg was partially severed. The body then fell on top of a car parked close to the portico. He died on the spot and the body was later shifted to Ernakulam general hospital.
 
 According to Rakesh, an eyewitness, the man waved at those standing on the ground to give way. “People were yelling from the ground asking him to not jump. The man was determined to take the leap,” said Rakesh.
 
 Soon after the incident, a flurry of rumours of him being a distressed litigant began to spread on WhatsApp groups. However, no mention regarding pendency of a case involving him could be found in the case list.
 
 Police sources said the deceased had told the security personnel that he was there to visit a lawyer and had made an entry in the visitors’ register. 
 
 High court registrar general   said the man had no pending cases at the high court.
 
 Johnson, according to those close to him, was a familiar face in police stations, local courts and human rights commission offices. “He was a peaceful man and had no known problems that could lead to a suicide,” said a relative.
 
 He used to earn his bread in Bihar by dealing in used Rajdoot bikes, but became a ‘legal activist’ a decade ago after his return to Kerala and soon earned the nickname ‘Pulival Johnson’.
