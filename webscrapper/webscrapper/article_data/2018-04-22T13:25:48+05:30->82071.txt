KOZHIKODE:The district panchayat authorities are working on a proposal to set up solar-powered   on   road, which connects Kozhikode and Wayanad. The stretch along which thousands of vehicles, including heavy trucks and interstate vehicles, ply daily also witness traffic blocks also on a regular basis, even during the night hours. 

 District panchayat proposed a project in the annual plan programme for the financial year 2018-19 to set up   streetlights on the 12 km stretch of Thamarassery Ghat road. The proposal was envisaged considering the measures taken by the district administration to develop the stretch and put an end to travel woes of travellers.
 
 Now the plan is to set up thirty solar-powered streetlights in the initial phase. The district panchayat has set aside Rs 14 lakh for the project in the annual plan programme for the year 2018-2019. 
 
 The district panchayat will carry out a field visit to calculate the total number of lights required on the stretch. The solar lams will be placed on the stretch where sunlight is available whole the day. 
 
 In the next phase, the authorities are also considering a proposal to set up closed-circuit television cameras on the Ghat Road stretch.
 
 District panchayat president   said that the decision to set up solar-powered streetlights on the Ghat road stretch was taken to reduce travel woes of inter-district and interstate passengers on the route.
 
 "The proposal has already been sent for vetting. The streetlights will be placed at places where direct sunlight is available and ensuring a mechanism for the regular maintenance. Steps will also be taken to protect the lights from monkey menace. Installation of streetlights will be a relief for passengers travelling this stretch, who at times are forced to wait for long hours owing to traffic congestion during night time," he said. "Measures to implement the proposal will be commenced once the project vetting process is complete," he added.
