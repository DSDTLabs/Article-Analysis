Navi Mumbai: The state public works department ( ) has found a temporary solution to prevent bike mishaps on   bridge that were reportedly occuring due to a wide gap in the metal expansion joint.

 The PWD has installed PVC Spring Post/   for maintaining lane driving. The arrangement is in place till a Thane-based consultant agency appointed by PWD submits a plan for a permanent solution. 
 
 PWD deputy engineer Pravin Naik said, “The bollards have reflectors for enabling the motorists and bikers at night to spot them from a distance. The linear vertical spring posts are fixed art a distance of 3 feet between the two bollards. The bollards have been put along the length of 110m on both sides of the expansion joint and that too on both the carriageways on the Jui bridge. Hence, the bikers and other motorists will now be able to ply on the first lanes of both the carriageways which was previously barricaded.”
 
 Technogem agency is only a consultant for PWD to suggest remedies and prepare estimates for the repair work, Naik said. “They are experts in technical matters. The repair will be carried out by PWD and even the expenses will be borne by the department. However, for installing bollards urgently, PWD has incurred an estimated expense of around Rs 3 lakh.”
 
  Even if the bikers crash into the bollards, they won’t get hurt as the bollards are made of PVC, Naik said. There are radium reflector strips on the bollards and motorists will be able to spot the lane division from a distance of 500m, he added.
