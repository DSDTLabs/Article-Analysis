PATNA: Contrary to CM Nitish Kumar’s apprehensions that the   is responsible for recurrent floods in Bihar, a   ( ) report on   in 2016 says the man-made structure even in the worst scenario can impact areas only up to about 42km upstream. Patna is located about 400km on the Ganga’s upstream.

 Based on the assessment of 100 years of floods in the Ganga, the report rather blames heavy banana plantation on the river bank between Patna and Bhagalpur as one of the reasons for the floods.
 
 Making extracts of the CWC report public, former deputy CM   on Thursday termed the Nitish government’s demand to decommission the Farakka barrage as “baseless”.
 
 “It has been scientifically proven that the Farakka barrage is not responsible for floods in Bihar. There are other factors responsible for the state’s water woes. Yet the state government is making baseless accusations. It is also organising a national seminar in Patna on the issue this week,” regretted Modi.
 
 Quoting from the report, Modi said, “There were apprehensions in certain quarters that during the August-September floods in Patna last year, the slow passage of water downstream of Patna was due to back water effect from Farakka... Even during the 100 years of flood, the maximum extent of back water effect is up to 42km upstream of Farakka barrage.” 
 
 The CM had on Monday reiterated his demand for decommissioning the Farakka barrage, saying it has been causing devastating floods in Bihar and West Bengal almost every year. “In addition to the recurring floods, the barrage is hindering the natural silt flow,” Nitish said.
 
 The CWC report, however, says the sedimentation in Ganga in Bihar is basically due to huge sediment load contributed from its northern tributaries, the Ghaghra, the Gandak and the Kosi.
