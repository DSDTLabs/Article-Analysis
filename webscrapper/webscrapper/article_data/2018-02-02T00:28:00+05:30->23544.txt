Pune: While the National Film Archives of India (NFAI) may reap the benefits of an increased operational outlay in the just-announced Union Budget, one of its biggest projects — the National Film Heritage Mission (NFHM) — will have to make do with a budget much smaller than last year’s.

 The NFAI’s operational expenses are paid as a part the “information and publicity” outlay, which is Rs 381.50 crore for 2018-19, slightly more than the outlay of Rs 357.79 crore for 2017-18. However, the total outlay for the Missions/Special Projects head, which funds the NFHM, is Rs 60.90 crores for 2018-19. That is a steep drop from the 2017-18 outlay of about Rs 110 crore.
 
 Only about Rs 7.57 crore of the 2017-18 allocation was actually spent. The first phase of the NFHM was launched in January 2017 at the NFAI, with an aim to preserve 1.32 lakh reels. “It is too early to know if NFHM’s work will be affected. The official documents need to come first,” said Prakash Magdum, the NFAI director.
