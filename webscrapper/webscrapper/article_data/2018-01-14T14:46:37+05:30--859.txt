 starrer   has been a much awaited film for the Malayali audience as it would bring him back on-screen after a bumpy year of arrest, speculation and investigations. The first look of the film, that was out recently, had him in a refreshing get-up. 

 Now, the latest film poster is out, and netizens cannot resist saying that it is nothing short of impressive. It features Tamil actor   making his Malayalam debut, and gives a hint that his character is as intense as Dileep’s. Siddharth’s character is seen holding a drink on his hands. 
 Kammara Sambhavam also has Murali Gopy and Namitha Pramod playing prominent roles. 
 
 Actor Dileep also posted about it on his social networking page and welcomed him to the Malayalam film industry. He said an actor like Siddharth has come a long way from his first film Boys to Jigarthanda, and his role in Kammara Sambhavam is likely to surpass all his performances till date.
