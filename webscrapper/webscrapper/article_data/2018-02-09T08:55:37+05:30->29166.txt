VARANASI: A total of 19   constructed under old buildings have been detected in a drive in   near Kashi Vishwanath Temple-Gyanwapi complex by the Varanasi Development Authority (VDA).

 According to VDA secretary Vishal Singh, the drive carried out by the VDA in Dalmandi area after January 15, has been completed. In this drive, 19 illegally constructed basements were found in this densely populated locality.
 
 Singh said that the VDA has prepared a report on the outcomes of its drive.
 
 He said that now the matter is being put before the district administration and police to decide the course of action in view of the ground realities of the area. The officials said that in case of demolishing the basement the entire building will collapse. Singh said that any decision regarding such basements will be taken after checking the strength of buildings.
 
 On the night of January 15, the SSP had detected an illegally constructed secret underground passage near the yellow zone (inner security cordon) of the highlysensitive   -Gyanvapi complex. The VDA had later sealed the construction and three other illegally constructed buildings and launched a drive to search more illegal basements.
