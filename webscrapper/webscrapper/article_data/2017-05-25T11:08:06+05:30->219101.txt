HYDERABAD: Two auto drivers suffered minor injuries when an auto trolley was hit by a cab from the rear at   junction near Narsingi on Wednesday. The injured were treated as out-patients at a local hospital, police said.

Police said both the autos suffered damage and police rushed to the spot on finding out about the accident to shift the injured to hospital.

 With increasing road accidents and insufficient enforcement on the ORR,   police will be using service additional speed guns from Thursday to track speeding vehicles. Overspeeding is among thr primary causes for accidents, especially on this road in the city. 
 
 The Cyberabad police commissioner Sandeep Shandilya will also give four new ORR patrol vehicles, the speed laser guns and 13 breath analyzers to the traffic wing at the ORR toll plaza at Nanakramguda on Thursday. 
 
 The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) has procured and given the equipment to the police as ORR was built by it and the HMDA oversees it. Currently, the Cyberabad police have two speed guns and two patrolling vehicles. Last week, the Rachakonda police pressed into service three new speed guns for the ORR stretch in its limits after a spate of recent accidents. tnn
