KOLHAPUR: The  ,   ( ) will be extending its secured remote paper delivery (SRPD) system to over 600 new subjects from the October 2017 semester examination. At present around 2,600 subjects’ question papers use the SRPD system.

 Mahesh  , Director, Board of Examinations and evaluation, SUK said that the new subjects are mainly from BCom, IT, MCom, BA sixth semester and other traditional courses.
 
 He said that workshops related to the extended subjects were conducted across Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts.
 
 Kakade told TOI, “Until now we were using the system for around 2,600 papers of engineering, pharmacy and other courses. These papers were securely transferred to the exam centres via SRPD. They received positive response from associated colleges as well as the officials concerned.”
 
 According to Kakade, SRPD system has proven best when it comes to confidentiality barring a few exceptional events like power failure, unavailability of internet, and technical difficulties in the computer system at the host colleges. These events had a minor impact on the working of the system.
 
 “We have asked the officials at the exam centres, if there is delay in the delivery of examination question paper, the university has strictly instructed to provide additional time to the students, for the time lost,” Kakade said.
 
 On the working of SRPD, Kakade said that under the new system, the examination department can send the question papers directly to the examination centres in an encrypted format via online. Nobody can decrypt the online copy of the paper. At the examination centre too, the concerned authority are given two onetime passwords, one to decrypt the document and the other one to download it.
 
 At present SRPD is being used for a few undergraduate engineering and pharmacy courses along with management courses in the colleges in Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur districts.
