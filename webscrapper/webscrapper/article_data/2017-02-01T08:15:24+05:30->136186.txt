HYDERABAD: As part of a nationwide call, medicos from both private and government medical colleges in the city will boycott their classes on Wednesday to register their protest against the proposed National Exit Test (NEXT).

 The   – an exit exam that the union health ministry wants every MBBS pass-out to clear before started their own practise – is sought to be introduced in the Indian Medical Council (Amendment) Bill shortly.
 
 This has led to furious reactions not just from the Telangana junior doctors’ association (TJUDA) but even from the Telangana chapter of  .
 
 “The Exit exam would turn out to be an additional burden for an MBBS intern (house surgeon) to take after sitting for a total of 112 exams in span of 5 years. What’s more, those who fail to qualify will not only be allowed to practise but will not even qualify for PG medical seat,” said Dr B Manoj, TJUDA president, Gandhi medical college.
 
 While claiming that NEXT exam would lead to depression among medicos, he said that the proposed test itself questions the teaching standards framed by MCI.
 
 “When every medical college in the country follows MCI’s standards, who would benefit from an Exit exam is difficult to understand,” said TJUDA, state president, Dr G Srinivas.
 
 Meanwhile, Dr  , state president of the Telangana chapter of IMA has given a call to all doctors and IMA leaders of all branches in the state to participate in the national agitation on Wednesday. 
 
 “We will stage demonstrations at prominent public places and a memorandum will be submitted to the district administration,” said Dr  , adding that they will also use social media to send messages to the Prime Minister and health minister.
