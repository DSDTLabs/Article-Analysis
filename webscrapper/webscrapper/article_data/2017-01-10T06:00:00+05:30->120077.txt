In a fitting finale to the rivetting four-day  , Hyderabadis were treated to a stellar line-up of traditional Rajasthan puppetry and a unique ‘Indian’ contemporary dance presentation on Sunday evening. The evening commenced with ‘No Strings Attached’, an enthralling   by   and his troupe from Rajasthan, which gave the audience a glimpse of colourful vignettes of rural life and folk culture of India’s desert state. The stage was then set for Padmashri  , internationally celebrated Indian contemporary dance icon, to mesmerise the 250-strong audience who gathered at  . ‘Rhythm Divine-II: River Runs Deep’, choreographed and performed by Deboo, was an amalgamation of elements of traditional Indian dance forms and European techniques, executed to the rhythms of Manipuri drums, called pung. And the result was breathtaking. At 69, with wiry grey hair, Deboo was a wonder to behold. With Manipuri drummers dancing the   around him, Deboo in magnificent costumes twirled non-stop, almost as if in slow motion, mesmerising the audience with meditative stillness of it all. It was a visual treat to see the dancers, dressed in white dhotis and turbans, play the Pung while dancing gracefully, executing the vigorous movements with poise. Synchronising with the sound of drums, from soft beats to thunderous crescendos, the dancers progressed from gentle movements to fast paced energetic dance.
The performance that shed light into the culture of North East India, was well-received by the city folk. When the performance ended, the entranced audience broke into loud cheers, whistles and applause, and gave the performers a standing ovation. A visibly moved Deboo said, “I have been to this city twice before... The audience here has always been special. It’s a pleasure to perform for you. thank you for all the love you have showered upon me.”
