BENGALURU: Five years after he exited public life under the cloud of illegal mining charges, former tourism minister and mining baron   attended a rally at the   convention in Bengaluru.

 Acknowledging the crowd's rousing response, which left most other party leaders stunned, Reddy praised the community for its staunch support. “I am here because the Reddy community has backed me. I do not need to reiterate the sequence of events which have occurred in the last five years. The community is equivalent to gold; it's value will never depreciate,“ he said. The former minister who is still with the BJP, said he is not interested in power any more. “I do not want to become chief minister either. Instead of growing politically, I wish to serve the community,“ said Reddy, who had played a key role in resort politics when BJP was in power.
 
 Chief minister   assured the Reddy community that their demand to be added to the OBC 2A category would be processed immediately.
