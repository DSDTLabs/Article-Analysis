JAIPUR: Rajasthan University is yet to finalise the format for admissions in post-graduation courses. The tug-of-war between Syndicate (apex body) and   over reducing the weightage of entrance test has put matter in a limbo from past few months. The Academic Council has recommended changes that weightage of entrance test must be reduced from 70% to 50% and academic scores to increase from 30% to 50% for admissions in PG courses.

 Those favouring the increase in weightage of academic scores to 50% say that a student works hard for three years in a subject has a better understanding which cannot be judged in a 3-hour entrance exam. “Students who apply for PG in   are mostly those who have completed their UG from RU and its affiliated colleges. They have gone through the rigorous training and they should be given preference in PG courses. The only way to give them preference is to award them high weightage in admissions,” said a teacher. A section of teachers also expressed apprehension that entrance exams are subject specific and chances of question paper leak are much higher.
 
 While those opposing it say that entrance exam is important to check the aptitude, knowledge and writing skills to judge the person’s ability to take up the course. “I believe that weightage of entrance exam should be increased to 90% as it holds importance to determine candidates’ ability to excel in the subject,” said a teacher who is of the view that academic scores at UG hold no importance.
 
 Rashmi Jain, vice-principal of Maharani’s College feels that both the schemes are incorrect. “Ideally, if we are conducting entrance exam, it should admit students purely on the basis of entrance exam scores. It will give a fair chance to every student,” said Jain.
