GURUGRAM: Tears of joy rolled down the eyes of   (30) as the court pronounced its judgment and handed down   to the accused in the   case. 

 “I was punished for being what all women are expected to be – a faithful wife,” said Suman, who was subjected to the attack in 2014 for refusing the advances of Raja. Suman had to spend more than six months in hospital for treatment after the incident. “Now, I am medically fit, but still face difficulties in moving. I’m unable to strain myself even after two-and-a-half years of the dreadful day,” said Suman adding that her body below the neck had suffered burn injuries in the attack. 
 
 Suman also spoke about her initial struggle in reporting the case. 
 
 “Initially my family was not willing to take the legal route as we are poor and could not bear the charges. Only after getting support from an   —  , which provided free legal aid, we pursued the case,” said Suman, who now works as an attendant in a city hospital. Her husband works as daily wager and their daughter’s education is being funded by the NGO. 
 
 Suman recalled that how her family were threatened with dire consequences and pressurised to take back the case, but she didn’t succumb and appeared in court as and when she was required during the trial. 
 
  “Slowly I am getting used to the change in my body, but there’s a constant fear in my mind, even when I am at home,” she said, adding that she hoped something would be done to stop such incidents.
