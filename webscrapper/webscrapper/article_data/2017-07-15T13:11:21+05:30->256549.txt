NAGPUR: Ruling out objections raised by the chief conservator of forest (CCF, Territorial) against granting no-objection certificate (NOC) for repairing hills on which   Gadh Temple is located, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court granted green signal to the PWD for completion of work.

 “The entire construction is only on face of hills and to preserve it from further sliding down. It’s nothing but repairing the hill and therefore, there is no question of it adversely affecting any forest. No plantation also can be undertaken at that place,” a division comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and   said.
 
 The court’s decision came after amicus curiae   pointed out that the work of strengthening broken surface of hills has become urgent as in rainy season there may be further land sliding and deterioration, thereby endangering the old temples on it. 
 
 “We find that Section 2(ii) of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, clearly reveals that such work which prohibits further sliding and deterioration of loose surface will strengthen shrubs and forest trees in the vicinity. As such, no permission therefore is required under the Act. We permit CCF and PWD to complete necessary formalities and to proceed further with the repair work,” the bench said before listing the PIL after two weeks.
 
 The court was hearing a suo motu plea on media reports exposing dilapidated condition of historic temple, thronged by lakhs of devotees every year and which was on the verge of collapse due to lack of maintenance. A Ramtek resident   also filed a PIL citing various media reports which mentioned that over 700-year-old historical temple belonged to Wakatak regime along with other temples like Kewal Narsimha and Rudra Narsimha came into existence.
