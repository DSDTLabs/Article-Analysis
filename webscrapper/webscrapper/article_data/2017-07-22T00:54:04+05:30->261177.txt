MUMBAI:  , who claims to be a biological daughter of  , son of former Prime Minister  , moved the   on Friday against filmmaker   to ask him to explain which 30% of the film â€˜Indu Sarkar' is factual and to delete them. She wants the court to stay the film's release, till he deletes them.

 The main plea is for orders to set aside the certificate granted by the Central Board of Film Certification to the film for its theatrical release, until Bhandarkar edits it and deletes the "30 percent" to the satisfaction of the board. The CBFC had granted the film a U/A certificate after being satisfied with the 12 cuts that the director has complied with.
 
 Paul's petition says Bhandarkar had stated during a television discussion that the film  , which he directed, is 30% fact and the remaining fiction. On Friday, her lawyer Tanveer Nizam mentioned the petition for a hearing before a bench of Justices Anoop Mohta and Anuja Prabhudessai. He said since the film is due for release next Friday it needs urgent hearing. The court scheduled it for a hearing on July 24.
 
 The lawyer wants the court to ensure that the film should be "historically correct'' . The petition is essentially asking the court to intervene as it questions how are the viewers to know which portion is fact and which is fiction.
 
 On Monday, the city police provided Bhandarkar non-categorized security in view of Congress workers protesting against the Indu Sarkar. Two armed constables were deployed to take care of Bhandarkar's security during the day while two others will protect him at night. 
 
 The special branch of the city police, which deals in collecting intelligence, is also keeping a tab on the activities of some political workers and is exchanging information with the city police.
