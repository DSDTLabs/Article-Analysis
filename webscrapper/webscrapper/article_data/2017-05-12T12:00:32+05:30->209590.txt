Sona goes to Ishwari's room where Radha is busy brainwashing her. Sona tells her that Dev wants Soha to spend time with him and Ishwari, so she has decided to let Soha stay here while she will go back to her parent's house.
 
  Dev is busy playing with Golu and Soha. Ishwari comes in and tells Dev that she wants to speak with him. Soha and Golu leave the room.
  
  Bejoy is excited to welcome Soha and Sona back. He asks the cook to prepare special dishes. Just then, Sona calls Bejoy and tells him that Soha is staying back at Dev's house and she is going to Gurgaoin for some work so she won't come. Bejoy gets angry.
  
  
 
  
  Ishwari starts emotionally blackmailing Dev and tells him that she wants to tell him something for some time now. Dev thinks of Khatri. She asks Dev to marry Sona for Soha's sake. He tells her that he can't after all the incidents that happened between them. Ishwari then tells him that if he can't marry Sona, then he should marry someone else and move ahead in life.
  
  Bejoy on the other hand is furious and starts packing his bags. Sona comes in and calms him down. The two have a long conversation. Bejoy asks Sona to promise him to not bring Dev back in her life.
