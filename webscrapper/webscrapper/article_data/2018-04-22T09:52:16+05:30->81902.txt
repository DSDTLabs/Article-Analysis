CHENNAI: The Madras high court has directed the commissioner of   and   (HR&CE) board to submit a detailed report in relation to the taking over and handing over report of the jewellery and properties belonging to   at Ayanavaram, on or before June 5. 

 Justice S M Subramaniam passed the interim order on a writ petition filed by Narasimha Bhattachari, one of the sons of a hereditary trustee of the temple, seeking a direction to call for the entire records pertaining to the order passed by the commissioner, HR &CE on August 7, last year. The said order permitted S   and S   to continue as hereditary trustees, despite allegations of several misconduct, between 2000-2013. 
 
 The charges included not maintaining a jewels and articles register, property register and collation of unlawful occupiers in nearly 100 premises related to the temple. After an inquiry, the two were found guilty, but their removal was stayed and the HR & CE commissioner's order had directed the two to rectify the records within six months.
