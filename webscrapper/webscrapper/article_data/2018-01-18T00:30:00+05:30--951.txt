Bengaluru: Over 150 staff   and 17 lab technicians hired on a temporary basis in the government-run   Memorial Institute of Oncology (KMIO) stayed away from work on Wednesday, protesting against pay disparity. 

 The protest disrupted services at the hospital, but the authorities claimed it was minimal.
 
 Lingappa Badiger, a staff nurse who spearheaded the protest, demanded that the Supreme Court verdict on equal payment to nurses be implemented. “We are working on a par with the permanent staff. We are paid only Rs 15,000, whereas a permanent staff nurse gets Rs 20,000 and above depending on seniority. We have no biometric attendance or identity cards,” said Lingappa.
 
 KMIO director Dr K B Lingegowda said the issue cannot be solved overnight. “Their demands were discussed. We made sure their protest does not affect patients.”
