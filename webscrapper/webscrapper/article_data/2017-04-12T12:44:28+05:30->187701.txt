Suit + sliders may seem like a big no! But, when it comes to our Bollywood actor  , he seems to carry off anything with elan. Recently, he was spotted wearing a pair of chunky sliders with a blue Paul Smith suit. The customised Adidas sliders paired with the colourful collared shirt just made a big fashion statement.
 
 
 Over the last few years, laid-back-luxe has risen and many celebrities have been spotted wearing sneakers and flats, channeling the effortless vibe. And now, Ranveer Singh just made an easy way of making summer style look more pared-down with sliders. This might benefit all the men out there for a comfortable fashion this summers.
