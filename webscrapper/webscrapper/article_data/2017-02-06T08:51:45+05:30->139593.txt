PANAJI: After a month long journey, officials of the   will finally have a slight respite, as there is more than a month till counting begins and results for the state assembly polls are declared. By Sunday, the department had completed sealing the EVMs, held a meeting with the candidates and scrutinized their own hits-and-misses.

 Stating that the official   stands at 82.23%, excluding postal ballots, chief electoral officer Kunal, who had earlier set a target of 90% turnout, said the idea of setting such a high target was to “capture the imagination of the voters and encourage them to come out and vote”. 
 
 “We observed, after discussing with the district collectors, that there were certain talukas where the turnout was low. One of the reasons which contributed to this trend is the migration and movement of voters out of the state. Women voted in large numbers in these areas, which shows that men in these areas are probably working out of state,” Kunal said, adding that the polling percentage still portrays a satisfactory figure. 
 
 The department had laid a significant emphasis on the   to exercise their right to vote through walkathons, visits to educational institutes and a viral campaign on the social media. 
 
 Returning officers of various constituencies said that after a month-long effort in preparation for the elections, during which the department was vested with the responsibility of maintaining the moral code of conduct, will now have to make arrangements for the poll counting on March 11. 
 
 “The polling went on peacefully in the general sense. The sealing of the EVMs has been completed and today, we scrutinized the whole process to analyze our own hits and misses. Now, the only work pending is on March 11, when votes will be counted,” a returning officer said.
