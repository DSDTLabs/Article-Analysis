NEW YORK: Here’s some sobering news: A large international study says adults should average no more than one alcoholic drink per day, and that means   guidelines in many countries may be far too loose.

 
 The study found that people who down more than seven drinks a week can expect to die sooner than those who drink less. Regularly drinking more than 100ml of   per week — about five or six medium glasses of   or pints of   — was linked to a shorter life expectancy for men and women, according to research published in Lancet.
 
 The team analysed data on about 600,000 drinkers aged 30-100, from 83 studies in 19 high-income countries. 
 
  
  
 
 “Recommended limits in Italy, Portugal, and Spain are almost 50% higher than this, and in the USA, the upper limit for men is nearly double,” the researchers found.
 
 The researchers factored in other health-related data such as the participants’ age, gender, diabetes history, their socio-economic status, and whether they smoked. 
 
 Among the group, the team recorded 40,310 deaths, and compared this with the participants’ self-reported levels of alcohol intake. 
 
 Drinking the equivalent of 100-200ml of pure alcohol a week shortened life expectancy by about six months compared to drinking less than 100ml, they found. Consuming between 200-350ml per week lowered life expectancy by one to two years, and more than 350ml by up to five years. 
 
 On average, each unit of alcohol consumed over the 100ml threshold slices about 15 minutes off a person’s life — about the same as a cigarette, David Spiegelhalter, a professor at the  , said in a comment on the report.
 
 The team found no evidence supporting a lower alcohol limit for women than for men. The research combined results from 83 studies conducted in 19 countries, tracking nearly 600,000 people who drank alcohol.
