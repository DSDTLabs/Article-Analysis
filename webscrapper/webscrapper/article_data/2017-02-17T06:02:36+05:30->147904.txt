The Tamil Nadu assembly will be facing a   after nearly 30 years. The last trust vote was held on January 27, 1988 after the   between M  's widow   and the party's propaganda secretary J Jayalalithaa whose group was headed by V R Nedunchezhiyan.

 The trust vote ended in violence and probably for the first time police was called into the assembly to contain the fight between members of the House. This time too there is a split in the party and O Panneerselvam has taken the role of Nedunchezhiyan.
 
 In 2006, the DMK did not get a majority on its own. It won only 96 seats in the assembly election, but the Congress, which had bagged 34 seats and was in power at the Centre, gave the party outside support for five years.
 
 “Even though the DMK did not have the numbers, it was not asked to prove its majority as the Congress had given a letter of support,“ a senior Congress leader told TOI.
 
 The 1988 trust vote was rigged by then speaker P H Pandian as many opposition members were disqualified before the actual voting.Some MLAs cross-voted and the speaker finally announced the Janaki faction to have won the trust vote.The vote resulted in violence and the 23-day Janaki government was dismissed using Article 356.
 
 Elections were held in 1989 which the DMK won with absolute majority and formed a government under M Karunanidhi after 13 years.
 
 The Saturday trust vote to be conducted in the assembly will be a fight between Panneerselvam and AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala.
 
 “We are determined to defeat the incumbent government. We have 10 MLAs but there are several others in the Koovathur resort who are our supporters. They will vote against the government,“ said a leader in OPS camp.
