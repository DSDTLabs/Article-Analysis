KOLKATA: A 34-year-old   resident has alleged that a   abused and robbed him of his cellphone on Saturday afternoon near the   station after a disagreement. The incident comes days after a horrific incident of road rage, also committed by a yellow cab driver, in which the young victim lost his life.

 Police said  , a resident of the   area, spotted the taxi moving towards Kalighat PS, around 12.15pm.
 
 “Parasar claimed that he asked the driver to drop him home,“ said an officer. “The driver, as yet unidentified, refused, saying it was too short a distance. An argument ensured, after which the accused allegedly foulmouthed Parasar in broad daylight. Worse, before leaving, the cabby snatched his cellphone, the victim claimed.“ The cops, though, said that it appears that Parasar's phone had fallen inside the cab.
 
 “The victim insisted that the driver stop so that he could retrieve the phone, but the accused fled, thinking Parasar might forcefully get inside the car. We have registered a case charging the driver with theft and criminal intimidation. In addition, we have also slapped Section 177 of the Motor Vehicles Act,“ explained a Kalighat officer.
 
 Several victims feel that a thorough interrogation by police and the transport department -going beyond spot fines and filling in of forms -could help rein in errant cabbies.
 
 If a cab, following a complaint, is blacklisted by the traffic department, the owner or driver of the taxi concerned would be forced to attend a hearing, failing which the vehicle would not be allowed to ply, said a transport department officer. “Once the taxi's registration number is locked, the owner won't be able to pay the quarterly fee, acquire a fitness certificate for the vehicle, get the meter checked, renew the permit or even go for a transfer of ownership,“ said a PVD officer.
