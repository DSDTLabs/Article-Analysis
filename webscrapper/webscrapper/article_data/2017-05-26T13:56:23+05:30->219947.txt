 "These two states together account for more than 70% of the skills deficit in these seven states (mapped by the paper) with highest per capita NSDP and large skill gaps. Haryana and Gujarat are expected to face shortage of approximately 13 lakhs and 11 lakhs persons respectively by 2022. Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab are likely to witness skills shortage of about five lakhs each by 2022", it said. 
 
 In terms of verticals, construction, building and real estate would have incremental human resource requirement of 31 million in the next five years, while retail sector would need about 17 million additional work force. Other sectors generating employment opportunities through skill up- gradation include beauty and wellness (10 million), transportation and logistics (12 million), furniture and furnishing (7.2 million) and handloom, handicrafts (6 million). Textiles and clothing would require additional 6.3 million people and tourism and hospitality 6.5 million.
