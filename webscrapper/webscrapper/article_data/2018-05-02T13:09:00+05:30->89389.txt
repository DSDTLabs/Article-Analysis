HYDERABAD: Municipal administration minister   on Tuesday took a potshot at TPCC president  's repeated vows that he wouldn't shave his beard until TRS is defeated in Telangana. "It does not matter to anyone whether you grow beard or remove it. It is not of any consequence to anyone. But, one thing is for sure. You will not be able to pull a hair strand of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao," Rama Rao said in reply to Uttam's utterances. 

 Taking part in the May Day celebrations at Telangana Bhavan here, Rama Rao said: "Not everyone who grows a beard should think he is 'Gabbar Singh'. We can also come up with dialogues but we also work," he said. "KCR lives in people's hearts," he said, explaining that criticism by Congress leaders would not affect the CMat all. "The doors of Pragathi Bhavan are not open to those who are critical of development in the state," he said in response to criticism of Congress that not everyone has access to the CM's camp office. 
 
 Rama Rao said it has become a habit for Congress leaders to criticise the CM everyday. "Now that they are out of power, the only thing they do is criticise. In the last three years, the government has worked towards fulfilling all its promises and also delivering on what was not promised," he said. 
 
 The minister pointed out it had taken 14 years for KCR to achieve a separate Telangana. "If some benefits are not reaching you, it will take time. You should have patience," he told the workers and explained the measures the government had taken for their welfare.
