BHOPAL: Two years ago, a road connecting a village to a school in   was built after a student wrote an emotional letter to chief minister  , requesting ‘Mama’ for help. Chouhan had intervened and sanctioned Rs 55 lakh for it. Now, the road has crumbled and the same girl is repairing it on her own after her requests to fill the potholes went in vain.

 On Sunday, villagers were surprised to see  , now in Class XI, and her brother Aamir, a Class X student, dumping stone chips to level out the craters.
 
 The 1km road from Maimoona’s native village Naktua to her Kendriya Vidyalaya was built in August 2014 after she wrote several letters to Chouhan, narrating how difficult it was for her to reach school. Moved by her letters, the CM ordered a road built immediately. She was a student of Class 9 when the road was laid under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). But it took barely two years to be reduced to rubble. 
 
 “Under PMGSY, roads are guaranteed for five years by the developing agency. Fed up by daily troubles, she made a complaint on the app launched by the Prime Minister in December last year. There was a quick response and district level officials were instructed to get the road repaired, but a month passed and nothing happened,” Maimoona’s father Hussain Pathan, who runs a tailoring shop, told TOI. 
 
 In January, she wrote to the district collector but again, nothing happened, Hussain said. “Children are suffering every day while going to school. Maimoona was upset,” he added. 
 
 “Today, since it’s a Sunday, she decided to take matters in her own hands. She took brother Aamir and they toiled for several hours to fill up the ditches,” Hussain said. Aamir, who did a lot of spadework, said: “The road has become horrible. We get back pain while travelling to school in an autorickshaw so we decided to repair it on our own.”
