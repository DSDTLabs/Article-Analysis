NEW DELHI: With   becoming fully functional by March 25, Delhi   ( ) has started taking steps to help flyers reach the right terminal without much hassle. 

 Large hoardings have been put up on the roads to all three terminals and announcements are being made on the Airport Express Line to inform flyers about the move. DIAL said it would install at least 150 display boards and banners with signage to guide passengers to Terminal-2 (T2). 
 
  
 A large number of shuttle buses will also be kept to ferry passengers from one terminal to another to ensure that nobody misses his flight. “We will run free shuttle services from both T1 and T2 at an interval of 10 minutes. This will be in addition to the DTC buses,” said a DIAL official. 
 
 T2 will be used temporarily by three airlines — GoAir, IndiGo and SpiceJet — until Terminal-1 is expanded. While GoAir has already shifted to T2, IndiGo and Spicejet will now partially operate out of this terminal. The distance between T1 and T2 is around 7km, while the same between T2 and T3 is around 500 metres.
 
 The terminals will also see special staff deployed to guide flyers based on their tickets, officials said. The GMR-led DIAL is already working closely with the airlines to inform passengers in advance about the move. “We are making all possible efforts to ensure passengers don’t face any confusion or inconvenience,” said an official.
 
 IndiGo and SpiceJet will number their flights in line with the new terminal. For instance, all IndiGo flights numbered between 6E2000 and 6E2999 will be available from T2. The destinations to be covered by these flights will be Chennai, Bangalore, Amritsar, Bagdogra, Bhubaneshwar, Raipur, Srinagar, Udaipur, Vadodara and Vishakhapatnam.
 
 SpiceJet’s T2 flights will have four-digit numbers, all starting with ‘8’ such as SG8913, the airline has said.
