KOLKATA: Since last Saturday, IIT-Kharagpur students have been using an app for their on-campus commuting needs. While that would mean app cabs for city dwellers, at the   campus which doesn’t allow students to use motorized transport, it means bicycles. This is part of a series of ‘affinitybuilding’ exercises between the institute and popular brands.

 
 While Ola is the aggregator for the bicycle app (Ola Pedal) on the campus, Oyo Rooms and Samsung are two other brands that have agreed to extend sizeable discounts to IIT-Kharagpur students. At least 10 other brands from various fields are willing to forge relations with the student community. The other brands will be announced after the summer vacations.
 
 In case of Ola Pedal, one needs to download the app and check the nearest point for an available cycle. There are fixed points across the campus for bicycle stands. One just has to pick up the cycle from one point and park it at a designated stand after the trip. For every 15 minutes of usage, a student has to pay Rs 5. Similarly, Oyo rooms have doled out a discount of 30% across their properties.
 
 An alumnus of the institute, Abhinav Sinha, who is one of the seniormost executives in Oyo, has helped in drawing up the understanding between the firm and the institute.
 
 Student vice-president and spokesperson for the programme Vishal Singh said, “This is the first time that an affinity programme has been conducted between corporates and any  . IIT-Madras will join soon. We shall gradually bring in the other IITs as well because if the number of takers increases, more brands will be interested in tying up as they can build up their client base.”
