LUDHIANA: Ticket aspirants thronged the   office on the last day of issuance of candidature forms for Ludhiana   elections. The party issued 408 forms to ticket seekers.

 There was huge rush of aspirants for eight city wards.
 
 The maximum forms have been received for wards 16, 17, 22, 58, 60, 68, 90 and 93. In the coming two days, the BJP is also going to conduct meetings with all its wings –– SC morcha, Yuva morcha and female wing –– for a discussion on MC polls.
 
 District president   said that the party workers are full of enthusiasm ahead of the MC polls and they have received applications from aspirants. He said they would decide candidates after scrutiny of applications and only deserving candidates would get a chance to contest the elections.
 
 Sources said senior leaders of Akali Dal contacted the state-level leaders of BJP for a meeting but the latter have advised the former to meet the local leaders of BJP for a decision over seat sharing.
 
 Already in a dilemma with BJP calling for applications from all 95 wards, Akali leaders want to decide about the wards with the alliance partner in order to avoid any rift at the later stage.
