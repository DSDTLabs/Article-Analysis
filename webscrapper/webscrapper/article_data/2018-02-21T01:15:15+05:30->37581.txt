NEW DELHI: Your waist-to-thigh ratio can serve as a simple and cost-effective screening tool to identify people at a high risk of type 2  , researchers from the Department of Medicine at the   (SGRH) and Moti Lal Nehru Medical College, Allahabad, have claimed. They say bigger the thighs, the lower are the chances of a person having diabetes.

 The findings, doctors said, were based on a “retrospective analysis” done on 1,055 patients at SGRH from March 2013 to September 2016. Its results have been published in the Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism. 
 
 Diabetes is a major challenge being faced by clinicians worldwide. An estimated 415 million people suffered from diabetes worldwide in 2015. This may reach a staggering figure of 642 million by 2040. Atul Gogia, co-author of the study and senior consultant in the department of medicine at SGRH, said their study revealed that diabetics had significantly greater waist circumference (WC) than non-diabetics. Also, diabetics had “lesser   circumference (TC) than non-diabetics.”
 
 “We found that a waist-thigh ratio (WTR) or WC (cms)/TC (cms) of 2.3 as a cut-off point, was a predictor of diabetes,” Dr Gogia said. “Simply put, a person having a WTR of less than 2.3, will be at a low risk of diabetes and may not require further investigations,” he added.
 
 According to Atul Kakar, also co-author and senior consultant at SGRH's department of medicine, “Asians have a larger tummy and thinner thighs and excess abdominal fat, making us more prone to diabetes.” Type 2 diabetes, the most common form, occurs when the body causes blood glucose (sugar) levels to rise higher. Mere diagnosis and treatment of diabetes will prove futile and uneconomical, unless those at risk are identified at an early stage, say doctors.
