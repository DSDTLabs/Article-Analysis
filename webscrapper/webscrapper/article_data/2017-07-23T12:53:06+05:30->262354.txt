 was not aired on July 22. Instead an old episode, which had cricketer Yuvraj Singh and his wife Hazel Keech as guests, was aired. The episode began with the disclaimer, "You are watching a repeat episode of The   Show today. Next week you will be able to see a new episode."
 
 Well, the potential reason for it is comedian Kapil Sharma's ill health. Kapil, who is also going to be seen in upcoming film Firangi, had to cancel the shoot of the show with the   cast - Anil Kapoor,  , Ileana D'Cruz and Athiya Shetty - few days ago as he fell sick, yet again. 
 
  
  
 There were reports that Kapil made the actors of the film wait for four hours, but Arjun Kapoor came to his rescue as he clarified on his Twitter account, "He didn't keep us waiting he unfortunately fell sick...the #Mubarakan team wishes @KapilSharmaK9 gets well soon & keeps making us smile..."
  
  
  
 
 Something on similar lines happened when SRK had to shoot for the promotion of his upcoming film   on The Kapil Sharma Show. Even then Kapil had to be rushed to the hospital and was admitted for a day.
  
 We wish the comedian-actor a speedy recovery.
