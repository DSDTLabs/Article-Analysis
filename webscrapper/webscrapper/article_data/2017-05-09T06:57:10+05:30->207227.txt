JAMSHEDPUR: The forest department claimed that tribal groups who ventured into Dalma forest to celebrate their annual hunting ritual, Bishu Sendra festival on Monday caused no loss to the wildlife in the Dalma sanctuary. 

 Officials claimed a drop in the number of groups that climbed the hilly terrain, coupled with tight security measures put in by the forest department. This has resulted in no loss to the lives of wild animals. Forest officials said that the search operation carried out on Sunday was productive in recovering the logistics and resource materials taken by the groups for hunting purpose. 
 
 "On Sunday evening we recovered a net and sickle from   (on NH 33 which is close to one of the entry points to the sanctuary) during the search operation," said  , divisional forest officer of Dhalbhum.
 
 He claimed that many villagers did not join the festival this year due to the awareness campaign organized by the department in the foothills of Dalma, which enlightened the villagers about the environmental hazards caused from hunting animals.
 
 Dalma forest ranger, R P Singh said that festive enthusiasts on three four-wheelers returned mid-way from   after noticing volunteers in large numbers.
 
 "On Monday morning we recovered long ropes and few sickles from   route (close to  ) in Patamda," said Singh.
 
 The Panchayat representatives at the village level also cooperated in motivating tribal groups not to kill animals," forest ranger said. 
 
 Organizers said that although the day was peaceful with no clash between the tribals and forest officials, added they cannot guarantee wildlife was not targeted by the groups. 
 
 "Majority of the groups will come down in the night and they might carry the remains of the animals targeted in the forest," said a functionary of the Bishu Sendra Parva organizing committee, preferring anonymity.
