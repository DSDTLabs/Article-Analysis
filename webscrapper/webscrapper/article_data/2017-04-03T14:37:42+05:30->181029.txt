In the mid 90’s when the lead dancers in films were all about romancing their heroines in scenic locations and doing a few awkward steps with background dancers blindly following them, there came a man who changed the way India looked at dance. Regarded as the Michael Jackson of India, Prabhudeva, with his swift and smooth dance moves, took the country by storm! Today, as the actor-director and choreographer turns a year older, let’s rewind to some of his unforgettable dance numbers:
 
  
  
 
 ‘Muqabala muqabala’ (‘Hum Se Hai Muqabla’, 1994)
 It was this song that catapulted Prabhudeva to national stardom. The swift-footed actor matched steps with the high tempo number and it was clear that India had found its very own Michael Jackson. This cowboy number from the 1994 movie still remains a hot favourite among his fans.
  
 ‘Urvashi urvashi’ (‘Hum Se Hai Muqabla’, 1994)
 Shot on Chennai’s busy roads, ‘Urvashi urvashi’ featured Prabhudeva at his best. From dancing atop buses to taking the streets of Chennai by storm, the agile dancer did all of it and established that when it came to grooving, very few came close to him.
  
 ‘Kay sera sera’ (‘Pukar’, 2000) 
 When Prabhudeva teamed up with the ‘Dhak Dhak’ girl  , the audience knew they were in for an unforgettable dance number. The actress matched Prabhudeva, step to step, beat to beat. This sensational song topped the music charts and is sure to get you grooving to this day.
  
 ‘Go go Govinda’ (‘OMG – Oh My God!’, 2012)
