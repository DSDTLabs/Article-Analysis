NEW DELHI: The   on Tuesday declined to order fresh probe into the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, saying the case had attained finality and there was no substance in the allegations regarding a mysterious person who had fired a ‘fourth’ bullet that killed him.

 A bench of Justices S A Bobde and L Nageswara Rao said it was not inclined to allow the plea of the petitioner, who termed the investigation into the assassination as the “biggest cover-up” in the history of India. The court said it will pass a judgement on his petition and reserved its order.
 
 In his plea, the self-confessed   and founder of ‘Abhinav Bharat,’ Pankaj Phadnis, insisted that four shots were fired and it was the fourth bullet that took Gandhi’s life. Phadnis said Veer Savarkar and the Marathi community in general had unfairly received the blame for Gandhi’s death. However, the Supreme Court did not agree with the notion that the Marathi community had been maligned. He approached the apex court after his plea was dismissed by the Bombay high court.
