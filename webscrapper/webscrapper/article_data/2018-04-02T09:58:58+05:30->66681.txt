Actor  , who has been married to actress Blake   for five years, joked that they could use a little time to themselves -- individually.

 Reynolds took to Twitter on Saturday to shut down rumours that his marriage to Lively was on the rocks because they are too busy to spend "quality time" with each other.
 
 "I wish. I could use a little 'me time'," Reynolds tweeted, reports etonline.com.
 
 "Me time" might actually be a little hard for the 41-year-old actor to find. When he is not on set or with his two daughters James and Ines, he is having a night out with Lively.
