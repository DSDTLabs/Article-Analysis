It was a rather special V-Day for Sandalwood's hottest couple,   and  . It was their first   post their recent wedding and the golden   squeezed in a quick four-day getaway to Radhika's favourite destination ' Goa. 

 "We have been extremely busy ever since we returned from the US last month, with family dinners and catching up with both Yash and my relatives. Yash and I both have taken time off to spend time with each other and the V-Day getaway was really special for the two of us. We've been together for six years and this is our first V-Day celebration post marriage. Yash serenaded me with red roses and a romantic dinner by the beach in Goa. He pampers me thoroughly," shares Radhika. The couple returned to the city on Thursday evening. 
 
 The couple will also move into a cosy pad shortly that is conveniently located in between Yash and Radhika's parents' home. "I'm also looking forward to celebrating my birthday next week with my husband. It will be fun because our fans will join us," Radhika sums up.
