NEW DELHI: Students seeking   in   can now   for  ,   and extracurricular activities ( )  .

 
 DU colleges reserve 5% of seats for sports and ECA quota. Aspirants have to upload self-attested certificates of past experience and perform well at trials to get quota seats. 
 
 This year, DU has made modifications for admissions through sports quota to make the process smoother.
 
 Under the centralised admission procedure, DU conducts trials for 36 sports disciplines, including basketball, cricket, football, volleyball and athletics; and 12 ECA disciplines, including creative writing, debate, dance and theatre. With the centralised trials for ECA admission, students have a chance to compete on the basis of abilities and not just certificates.
 
 Students are expected to submit one certificate in the mandatory uploads section while filling the online ECA form.
 
 An official, who conducted ECA trials last year, said the venues are being prepared in a way that aspirants appearing for more than one category will find it easy to commute. “There are 14 venues. We are planning to time the trials in a way that popular categories like debate and performing arts are conducted on dates close to each other,” she said, adding that in case the dates of trials clash, aspirants can approach the panel and get them rescheduled.
 
 For sports, however, aspirants need to upload three certificates from this year. This, according to DU sports council secretary Anil Kakal, will make it easier for aspirants to get admissions. “We have made sports admission smoother by asking colleges for a list of requirements with the number and positions in their team. Colleges have requested for specific positions so that they do not get extra players and we will conduct trials based on that,” he said
 
 The university also specified that in case of a tie between students, the one with higher marks in the trials will be considered.
