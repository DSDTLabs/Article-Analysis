MAJITHA: Finally clearing the dust over Congress party's Chief Minister candidate, All India Congress Committee Vice President   announced that Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Captain Amarinder Singh is the CM candidate of Congress for the state.
 
 "A Punjabi will be the CM of Punjab, he is sitting here among us. Amarinder Singh will be our CM candidate, he has given his life for Punjab and never made shallow promises," said Rahul Gandhi while addressing a gathering at Akali's bastion Majitha on Friday.
  
 As the Nehru Gandhi family scion made the announcement of Amarinder's name, the whole audience predominantly Congress workers and leaders burst into applause, clapping and raised high-pitched slogans in praise of Congress party, giving much relief to Amarinder Singh.
  
 Quoting Guru Nanak's philosophy of 'tera hai' (it's yours), he satirically remarked that Akali's have transformed 'tera hai' into mera hai (it's mine) while giving reference to alleged acquiring of running businesses, industries and transport of Punjab to erect their own empire.
  
 Without naming anybody, Rahul said that if voted to power, Congress government in Punjab would send all drug peddlers, and those who had given shelter to them, behind bars and would wipe out 'chitta' trade by formulating stringent laws.
  
 Claiming that Punjab had been plunged into total destruction and devastation by Akali's, Rahul assured that Congress government would bring back old glory of Punjab but at the same time he told people to not expect results in a few days.
  
 "Punjab cannot be restored to its old glory in two days but it will be done with the blood and sweat of Amarinder, Sidhu, me and the people of Punjab, backed by the rest of the party leadership," Rahul Gandhi said, while urging the people of Majitha to 'strengthen the hands of the party'.
