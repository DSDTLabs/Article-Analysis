Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court on Tuesday held that all colleges and universities in the state have to route admissions in professional courses through Admission Committee for Professional Courses (ACPC). With this, the court has said that the Raksha Shakti University will have to induct students only by participating in the centralized admission process by ACPC. It cannot give admission to students in B.Tech and M.Tech courses on its own. This happened after a student Sandip Munjyasara filed a PIL objecting to RSUâ€™s admission procedure by bypassing ACPC. tnn
