RAJKOT: Janaksinh Takubha Chauhan, classified as a notorious criminal, made an unsuccessful attempt to escape from the custody of Jamnagar police near   in Jamnagar on Thursday early morning and in the process four policemen were injured. While struggling to escape, Chauhan tried to strangulate the police van driver who lost control of the vehicle and it overturned.

 The four policemen of the Jamnagar local crime branch (LCB), who sustained injuries include the driver Harpalsinh Sodha, ASI Jaydevsinh Zala, head constable   and constable Pratapsinh Kathi. Chauhan, who was also injured in the incident, was booked for attempt to murder, obstructing police from performing their duty, attempt to escape from police custody and assault. The FIR was registered at Dhrol police station by Sodha.
 
 Chauhan, who is wanted in at least half-a-dozen cases registered in Jamnagar such as assault, theft, issuing threats and extortion, was nabbed on Wednesday night from Dhola village in Bhavnagar based on specific information by Jamnagar LCB sleuths. Police said that the cops were in civil dress and used a private vehicle to reach Dhola village to nab Chauhan as the accused had previously given them a slip many times.
 
 When police were returning to Jamnagar in a private vehicle with Chauhan, the accused who was in handcuffs, grabbed Sodha from behind and tried to strangulate him near Dhrol town. Since Sodha was driving the vehicle, he lost control due to the sudden attack from behind. The vehicle went off road and overturned. The other cops in the vehicle, however, managed to catch hold of Chauhan and foiled his escape bid.
 
 After first aid at Dhrol hospital, the accused was taken to Jamnagar for further interrogation. Chauhan is accused of threatening labourers, assaulting land owners and others in Navagam, Jamvadi, Chavdi, Bhangad and Macharda village of   of Jamnagar.
