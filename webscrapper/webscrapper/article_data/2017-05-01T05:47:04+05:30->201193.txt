JALANDHAR: An 18-year-old youth died allegedly of   at   near Jalandhar on Saturday. His parents have now blamed two youths from the same village for providing him drugs.

 Police registered a case against the two accused under   of the IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) at Jalandhar Sadar police station on Sunday.
 
 "Ravi's family has named two youths from the village,  , alleging that they were accompanying him when he left home and gave him drugs. They have claimed that Ravi was not a drug addict," investigating officer   said. 
 
 Ravi died in the civil hospital on Saturday, a day after his parents admitted him there. Police said the exact cause of the death could be known only after the autopsy report.
 
 Ravi had left home on April 24 and returned on April 27. His parents told cops that Ravi was in a bad shape when he returned and appeared to be under the influence of drugs. They took him to the civil hospital on April 28 and he died the next day. Singh said the two accused were at large and "the rest of the story would come out after they are arrested". 
 
 Inquiries with the villagers revealed that some youths who were addicts have been doubling up as peddlers. "They even go to Rajasthan to bring drugs," a villager, who doesn't want to be identified, said.
