GURUGRAM: The education department has   eight government schools in Gurgaon district from middle school to   secondary school. The step was taken as part of the department’s move to upgrade 62 schools in the state to help students to continue their education without any worries till Class 12. 

 According to the list released by the education department the eight government schools are located in Begampur Khatola, Gairatpur Bass, Gadoli Khurd, Sukharli, Wazirabad, Narsingpur, Bhimgarh Kheri and Kadarpur. 
 
 However, primary school teachers have claimed that though the   school status was given to these schools, they are lagging in infrastructure and resources. Tarun Suhag, president of primary teachers’ association, said, “The schools have been upgraded but they need time to establish the infrastructure. Starting from classrooms, desks to teaching staff, everything needs to be done. The senior secondary session would begin from next academic year.” 
 
 District elementary education officer Ram Kumar said, “There is a shortage of teachers in schools but the vacancies will be filled up soon. At the same time, classrooms will also be built. the education department will soon release funds to help schools have proper resources.”
