Surat: Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) BRTS cell conducted a trial run of its buses from Magdalla junction to airport here on Saturday. 

 It was a long-pending demand by Airports Authority of India (AAI) to extend the BRTS services to the airport premises to facilitate passengers, especially those coming from other states. The airport is yet to have taxi facilities, which is annoying for many outstation passengers who have to wait outside the premises in search of transport vehicles. 
 
 Official sources said the trial run of BRT buses was conducted from Magdalla junction to airport on Saturday and that the passengers who arrived in various flights were given a free ride. 
 
 As per the survey report of AAI, around 150 passengers are at the airport per flight. In a day, the airport caters to around 11 direct flights to various destinations including Jaipur, Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Goa, Patna and Kolkata. Over 2,000 passengers arrive and depart from the airport on a daily basis. 
 
 A BRTS cell officer said, “The proposal was sent by the airport authorities a few months ago. However, we were waiting for the clearance from the AAI for the allotment of bus station inside the airport premises. The AAI has approved the station space inside the airport. The bus services will start from the next fortnight.”
 
 Airport officials said the civic body has been urged to construct speed breakers near the entry gate of the airport towards Dumas and Magadalla.
