BENGALURU: All eyes will be on Lingayat MLAs from   and JD(S) when chief minister BS   takes the floor test in the assembly on Saturday.

 
 Many   leaders think Lingayat MLAs from the two opposition camps might cross-vote in favour of the trust vote, keeping in mind their own political future and to avoid incurring the community’s wrath. There are 18 Lingayat MLAs in Congress and two in JD(S).
 
 According to a state BJP insider, the party is hoping to lure a few Lingayat MLAs by pointing to the deep-rooted discontent in the community over Congress’ pre-poll gamble to divide the community. “Lingayat MLAs were upset with Congress for its effort to divide the community. They are even more upset now with the party deciding to go with JD(S), which is seen as an anti-Lingayat party. More importantly, they (Lingayat MLAs) don’t want to be blamed for denying the CM’s post to Yeddyurappa, who the community considers its leader,” said a saffron party MLA. 
 
 The MLA said Yeddyurappa’s appeal to MLAs to vote as per their conscience during the trust vote, soon after he took oath as CM on May 17, was aimed at the Lingayat MLAs in the opposition camp.
 
 “Many Congress MLAs, especially from  , feel Yeddyurappa’s defeat will consolidate Lingayat votes behind BJP ahead of   elections. The possibility of a mid-term election to assembly also cannot be ruled out either. All these things will come into play during voting,” said another BJP leader.
