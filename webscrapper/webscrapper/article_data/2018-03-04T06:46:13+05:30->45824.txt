Congress’s disastrous show in the north-east marks a serious diminution in the stature of C P Joshi, the   general secretary who till recently was known for his proximity to party president Rahul Gandhi.

 Joshi has been the   in-charge of northeastern states, but state units have been critical of his style of functioning and skills alike. The biggest jolt to Joshi came from Bihar this week when four MLCs, led by former state chief Ashok Chowdhury, quit the party. The latter targeted Joshi in his parting diatribe. Joshi is also the incharge of Bihar affairs.
 
 The lack of confidence in Joshi’s functioning was evident when Congress despatched senior leaders   and Kamal Nath to explore the scenario in   on Saturday morning. Congress has emerged as the single largest party but National People’s Party is snapping at its heels at just two seats short and a large contingent of “others”.
 
 Also, the Nagaland unit has accused Joshi of neglecting the state, holding him responsible for the complete drift in Congress.
 
 Last year, Joshi came under fire when Congress let power slip through its fingers in Manipur. Congress emerged as the single largest party with 28 seats in the 60-member assembly and had smaller parties ready with support but it was BJP which presented a list of supporting MLAs to the governor.
 
 Joshi was criticised for leaving it late in Manipur, though it is said in his defence that the then chief minister Ibobi Singh was better equipped than an “outsider” to deal with the post-election scenario.
