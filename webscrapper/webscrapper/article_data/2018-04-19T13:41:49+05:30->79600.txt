LUDHIANA: A local court has sentenced a Delhi man to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in a   case.

 A fine of Rs 1 lakh has also been imposed on the convict,   of New Delhi. In case of default in fine payment, he will have to undergo another year of rigorous imprisonment.
 
 The police had booked Maninder, 31, on July 6, 2013, after eight bags of poppy husk (each weighing 19.5-kg) were recovered from his car.
 
 As per prosecution, a check-post was set up on GT Road in Doraha. Around 10.30am, a white car (PB11AN-6757) coming from   side tried to escape on seeing the police. When chased, the driver — Shammi, also a resident of Delhi — abandoned the car at some distance and tried to flee along with the other car occupant, Maninder. While   made good his escape,   was nabbed. Eight bags of poppy husk were recovered from the car, which was later found to be stolen. 
 
 During the case trial, Maninder pleaded innocence. 
 
 The additional public prosecutor for the state sought punishment for the accused on the basis of prosecution evidence, including witnesses and chemical examination report of the recovered consignment. 
 
 The defence counsel contended that although a witness joined the investigation, he had not been examined. 
 
 The court observed, “The official witnesses have deposed in unison with regard to the day, time, place and manner of recovery of the contraband from the possession of the accused. There was no reason on their part to falsely implicate the accused and as such, no doubt is cast on the prosecution version.”
