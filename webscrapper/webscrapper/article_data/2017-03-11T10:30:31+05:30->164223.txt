HYDERABAD: Chief minister   wants the development of the 338-km   (RRR) beyond the Outer Ring Road to be given top priority. Officials of the Roads and Buildings have been told to start the works on two prestigious projects. Apart from the RRR, the second on the priority list of the CM is the 396-km long Sarapaka-Eturunagaram-Kaleswaram-Kauthala-Sirpur road that runs through the interiors of state.

 Both these road projects are to receive funding from the Union Road Transport Ministry. According to sources, roads and buildings minister   has instructed officials at a review meeting that of the total 2,700odd km of the NHs sanctioned by the Centre to Telangana, these are the two projects that would be taken up on priority in the 2017-18 fiscal.
 
 Officials said the CM is of the firm view that while works at the ground level on the RRR should commence in the ensuing fiscal, conversion of the Sarapaka-Sirupur stretch into NH will kick up economic development in the interior areas of the state. Interestingly , RRR passes through Gajwel, the Assembly constituency being represented by KCR.
 
 The state government is seeking at least `5,000 crore in the 2017-18 fiscal from the Centre to start works on these two prestigious projects. The Sarapaka-Sirpur stretch is also eligible for central funding as part of the improvement of road connectivity in Left Wing extremism-affected areas.
 
 The RRR project is expected to cost up to `8,000 crore, and officials have decided to break this project into two bits for speedy funding as well as faster completion of works.The first bit will extend from Sangareddy-Narsapur-Toopran-Gajwel-JagdevpurBhongir-Choutuppal (152.05) km, and the second stretch runs between ChoutuppalIbrahimpatnam-AmangalShadnagar-Chvella-Shankarpalli and Kandi (186-km).
