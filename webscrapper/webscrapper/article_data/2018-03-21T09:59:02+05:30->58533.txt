LUCKNOW: More than 2,500 residents of   township on   have revolted against   for breaking down the township's boundary wall to make an approach road for  's new housing project named 'Aurangabad Khalsa'. 

 Manoj Kumar Jha, president of the township's resident welfare association, told TOI, "Since LMC's land is surrounded by the boundary wall of township on one side and PGI on the other side, they have forcefully broken our boundary wall. Several vehicles and workers are moving about within the township, posing a great risk to our security."
 
 According to the residents, at the time of registration of flats, the builder had assured that the township would be a gated society with walls all around and no outsider would be allowed to trespass the boundary. However, the builder couldn't oppose when LMC broke the wall, saying the agency could sabotage its projects. 
 
 Residents said they met the municipal commissioner but he said the builder had signed an agreement with LMC for the road. 
 
 Municipal commissioner   said, "We had transferred some land to Omaxe earlier, in lieu of which it gave us this land nearby. It had agreed to give us the approach road through the premises. We are in no way forcing any encroachment on the township." 
 
 However, his claims were refuted by allottees who claimed that neither the builder nor LMC was able to show them records of the agreement. 
 
 The builder remained mum on the issue despite repeated attempts to reach him. A legal official from Omaxe said on condition of anonymity that nowhere in their advertisement had they claimed to provide boundary walls. He said the company had signed an exchange deed with LMC which had a condition that approach road should not be a restriction to any party.
