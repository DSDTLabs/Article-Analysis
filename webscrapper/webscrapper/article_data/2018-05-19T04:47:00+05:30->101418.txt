 The deceased are Aditi, 12, Bhuvan, 8 and Shravan, 7. The elders learnt about the tragedy only after they finished the rituals and came out of the temple. 
 
 Aditi and Bhuvan were siblings and children of Venkatesh Bhat and Preetham Bhat. Shravan, their cousin, was the son of Priyanka Bhat, Preethamâ€™s sister. Their bodies were recovered on Thursday.
 
 After performing some religious rituals in Gurpur, the family members had on Tuesday visited Nagueshi temple at Ponda in Goa. Realising that the children could venture into the huge pond near the temple, the parents had cautioned them against getting into it. However, on seeing some local children play in the pond, the three children too stepped into the water. However, they were unable to gauge the depth of the pond and they did not know swimming. Moreover, they did not know the local language because of which they failed to communicate with the locals. Hence, they drowned and died. 
 
 Though a search operation was launched, their bodies were recovered only on Thursday morning. After  , the parents completed the   in Goa itself.
