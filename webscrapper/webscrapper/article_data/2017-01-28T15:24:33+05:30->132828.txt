DEHRADUN: The lone tigress at   may soon get a mate. The   in   and Itanagar in   have agreed to provide a tiger each to the zoo, reviving  .
 
  The zoo authorities are also hopeful of breeding the Himalayan wolf. A pair of wolves’ enclosure has been covered this year to provide them with a conducive atmosphere to breed. They dug up a burrow, which the species do before breeding, which is being seen as a positive sign. The wolves are a big draw in the zoo as this species is otherwise not found elsewhere in the state.
  
  According to Rekha Palaria, zoo biologist, the tigress, nine years now, was rescued in 2009 when it was a cub at Ramnagar near Corbett. The cub had apparently got separated from its mother. Thereafter. the tigress was raised in the zoo. After mating with a tiger in the zoo premises in 2014, it gave birth to a cub but the latter died within 24 hours. The following year, the tiger died of old age. Since then. the tigress has been all alone.
  
  Dharam Singh Meena, director of Nainital zoo, said, “The zoo authorities of Hyderabad and Itanagar have agreed to give us a tiger each. In return, we will give one leopard to Arunchal and one black bear to Hyderabad.”
  
  The zoo authorities were also pinning hopes on breeding a Tibetan or Himalayan wolf this year. “We have given a covering to the enclosure of the Tibetan wolves so as to give them a feel of their natural habitat. They are not shifted in enclosures at night so that they remain undisturbed,” said Meena.
  
  The pair of wolves, five years old, were born and bred in the zoo. But for some reason they have not been able to breed. Disturbance caused by visitors and unnatural surroundings could be the reasons, the zoo officials said.
  
  Yogesh Bhandari, zoo veterinarian, said the tigress has some three to four years to breed. The wolf, which have survived well in the climate of Nainital , have 10 more years to breed.
