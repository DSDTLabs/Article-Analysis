Kannada cinema’s Golden Queen,  , is set to get married. The actress will tie the knot with  , an MBA graduate from London, whose business interests include real estate, construction and automobiles. He is the son of politico and former corporator of Rajarajeshwarinagar, GH Ramachandra. 

 On Thursday evening, a bale todiso shastra was held for Amulya, but what was interesting is that the couple found matchmakers in Sandalwood star Ganesh and his wife, Shilpa. And it all happened in just three days. “Jagdish’s family and my family have known each other through   ma’am and Ganesh sir. We had met socially at functions, but had never interacted much. It was Shilpa ma’am who suggested my name when she heard that Jagdish’s parents were looking for a match for him. We both hail from the same community and our horoscopes were matched as per the wishes of our elders. It all came together on Thursday and Jagdish and his family came home to complete the necessary formalities. My family visited them for another round of rituals on Friday,” says Amulya. 
 
 Jagdish, meanwhile, says that he’s a big Kannada film buff and has watched all of Amulya’s films. “She was fabulous in   and Shravani Subramanya. What I like about her is that despite the fame that’s come her way, she is simple and down-to-earth,” he sums up.
