KOLHAPUR:Maharashtra State   Company Limited (MSEDCL) has decided to file criminal cases against any private meter reading agency that is found guilty of recording wrong meter readings.

 The public power utility often faces issues of exorbitant billing, wrongful billing and random bills. The MSEDCL has decided to take such steps, in order to tackle random, faulty or manipulated electric meter readings without actual inspection.
 
 MSEDCL has hired private billing agencies due to a lack of workforce, but the company has faced the wrath of consumers due to lethargic approach by these agencies.
 
 However, private contractors manage to escape any action from the company due to their internal connections with officials. To break the nexus, the company has decided to file criminal cases against agencies for their wrongdoings.
 
 Regional director of Pune MSEDCL   recently said, “Despite introduction of mobile application based meter readings, meter agencies fail to take proper readings. They have been caught by our engineers. It contributes to financial losses in the company. Therefore, the company has decided to blacklist such agencies and file criminal cases against them.”
 
 The chief engineer of Kolhapur zone of MSEDCL said, “We have deployed our officials to monitor and re-examine meter readings. If private meter readers are found guilty, appropriate action will be taken against them.
 
 Sources at the Kolhapur zone of MSEDCL said, “In the recently concluded consumer grievance campaign, around 70% complaints were regarding random or faulty billings, non-cooperation from officials and lack of transparency.”
