  Sona reaches the police station and meets Inspector Prakash. She meets Khatri. Sona then tells him that Dev has both money and power and he might get Khatri killed and no one will get to know. She asks Khatri to give her the address and she can help him release. Khatri agrees and gives her the address.
  
  Dev is eagerly waiting for Sona's call. Sona calls and tells him that she has got the address and in return Khatri is released from the jail.
  
  Sona waits outside for Khatri. He comes out and tells her that he gave the wrong address and thanks her for the bail.
  
  Sona returns and tells Dev that Khatri fooled her and gave the wrong address. Dev shouts at her and tells her that because of all this, his mother's dignity is questioned again. He continues shouting.
