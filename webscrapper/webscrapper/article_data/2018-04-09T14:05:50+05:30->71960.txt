Handling at least 500 buses every day, the   bay in the Central bus stand here is in dire need of refurbishment. The platform with a dozen bays to park buses has got no purpose for the slots since buses used to park parallel to the platform to embark and disembark passengers. Citing the lurking danger due to the uneven surface, passengers as well as   workers often slip into the bay, had sought modification of the platform.

 According to transport corporation workers, the platform for buses to Thanjavur and other delta districts have a queue system for people to embark buses, while in other platforms buses are parked into the bays assigned. The officials said that Thanjavur platform was the most crowded among the seven platforms and also the largest in terms of bus handling. As the bays provided with openings for buses to halt were not used due to space crunch, the enclosures remain unutilised for years now. "People unaware of the uneven surface often slip while getting off the buses injuring themselves. Recently a senior citizen sustained severe injuries after slipped off the bus and later died in a hospital," S Kumar, TNSTC time keeper in Central bus stand told TOI.
 
 The TNSTC workers have demanded that the bays to be made even and covered without gaps so that people will not slip while boarding or disembarking the buses. 
 
 Due to the uneven surface, elderly passengers had also complained that the surface was quite difficult for them to board the buses. Senior officials with   told TOI that the bays in Thanjavur platform would be inspected to do the civil modifications, if required.
