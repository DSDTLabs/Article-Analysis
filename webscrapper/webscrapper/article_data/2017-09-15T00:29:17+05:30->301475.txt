NAVI MUMBAI: The app developed for   and identification by the state government has several glitches, said civic sources.

 One of its provisions entails enrolling more than one member of a family for licence which has led to a lot of confusion. “NMMC did a field trial with the app around three months ago and last month, asked the government to make a correction,” said additional municipal commissioner,  . 
 
 As per the reworked provision, one licence will be given per family. If on a certain day, any other family member wants to hawk, the licence would act as the common proof.
 
  “The state has asked for a new survey that will be done scientifically and cover all hawkers,” said a civic official who acknowledged the glitches in the survey.
 
  But, even the new survey will throw up other issues. The state has not changed the cut-off date of May 1, 2014 for issuing licences, which raised questions about identifying those who were in the business till then. 
 
 The vendors can provide a receipt of goods purchased from the wholesale market as proof. But not all are bulk buyers. Also, the receipt of any fine imposed on a hawker is proof of his legal status but the receipt does not name the location. Also, the periodic civic survey to identify how many vendors did business till the cut-off date largely took a count of the licenced vendors. 
 
  There were around 2,300   till 2003. There was no licence issued thereafter, as per  . Unofficial estimates put the number to around 15,000 or more.
