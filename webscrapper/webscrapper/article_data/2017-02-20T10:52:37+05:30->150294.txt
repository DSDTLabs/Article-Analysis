At a time when everyone is incensed about the horrendous experience of assault a Malayalam actress had to go through on February 17, the industry is also not forgetting to laud her courage to speak up against her tormentors. 

 Her friend and designer Poornima Indrajith said on her social media page, "She was someone who was quite livid over the experiences of Aruna Shanboug, Jisha and Sowmya, and enraged about the authorities not ensuring their safety. She also used to say 'It can happen to you or me.' However, she is extremely bold, much more than you would ever imagine."
 
 The Malayalam industry had convened a meeting in support of the actress on February 19 in Kochi, and said that they are proud of her for not being a silent victim, but a strong survivor who spoke out.
