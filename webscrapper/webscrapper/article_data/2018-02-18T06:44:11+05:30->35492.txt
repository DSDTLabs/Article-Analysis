By-   

 As I reached the spot in   around 6am on Saturday, the public was shouting, “Tendua bhag gaya, police aur van vibhag wale kya kar rahe hain... police murdabad (The   has escaped...what are police and and forest department doing)”.
 
 In the open area outside the village, the  
 
 
 was checking the net which had been erected to restrain it. The net had been cut.
 
 Suddenly, a few locals shouted, “Idhar hai, dukan ke andar...(it is here, inside a shop)”.
 
 The forest team rushed to that spot and the leopard jumped into a house. Meanwhile, the public brought a net to cover that house from the top. I went to the terrace of the adjacent house and saw the   take a high jump and escape into another house.
 
 I went to that house behind a policeman. He fired one bullet just as I reached. The leopard vanished and the policeman went looking for it.
 
 From another room, a woman shouted that she saw the leopard entering her room. The policeman fired a bullet in that direction. Seeing the officer, the panicking leopard moved in his direction. As it came near, the officer fired another bullet.
 
 I moved out at the same time amid the commotion. Minutes later, I saw the public shouting praises of “SO sahab zindabad.”
 
 The policeman came out with a bleeding hand and head. After he came out, one more bullet was fired. I do not know who fired that bullet. I tried to go inside the house but the public stopped me.
 
 I then went to the terrace of the adjacent house and could hear the feeble sound of the big cat crying out in pain. About five minutes later, the sound stopped, leading to an end to both the life of the feline and the commotion of the previous few minutes.
 
 Outside, the public was still praising the police and celebrating.
 
 Almost 15 minutes later, the forest team came and saw that the leopard was lying in the kitchen. It was then declared dead by them
