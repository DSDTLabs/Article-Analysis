During the sangeet ceremony, Mahi blackmails Anika by telling her that he would kill Soumya and others if she acts smart. Anika asks him to leave Soumya, and he assures her that he'd only if she agrees to him. 
 
 Anika is unable to think of a way to tell   that Mahi knows everything. Meanwhile, Priyanka and Ranveer ask Mahi to kill Shivaay, so that he could take his place in the house. Mahi refuses initially, but then is left with no option.
 
  
  
 Kamini asks Mahi to announce Priyanka's pregnancy news to everyone even when he doesn't want to. Later, she tells everyone that their family pundit has asked them to get Priyanka and Ranveer married in another 20 minutes, else the 'mahurat' will be after 2 years. 
  
 They all get confused. Mahi threatens Anika to agree, and she does so since Soumya's life is in danger.
