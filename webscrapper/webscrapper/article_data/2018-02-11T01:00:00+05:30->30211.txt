Former FTII chairman Gajendra Chauhan, best known for his portrayal of Yudhisthira in BR Chopra’s 'Mahabharat', will soon be seen in 'Vighnaharta Ganesh' as Dambasura. The actor, who has been a part of numerous mythological shows, was previously seen playing Sumant in 'Sankatmochan Mahabali Hanuman'. He says, “I have been associated with more than 100 mythological serials, but I am playing an asura for the first time.”
 
 
 
 Shafaq Naaz, who was on a break since June 2017 after she quit 'Chidiya Ghar', is back in action. The actress, who shed 13 kilos in two months, is all set to join 'Mahakali — Anth Hi Aarambh Hai'. She says, “I play Vrinda, who fights her own battles. It’s great to be back on screen; I was focusing on my transformation as I wanted to be back in a new avatar.”
 
 
 
  
 A new chapter has begun after 'Bhootu' went in for a time leap, which marked the exit of the lead couple, Sana Amin Sheikh and Kinshuk Mahajan. And guess who will join Tushar Khanna in the new storyline? Khushbu Thakkar, who got married recently. The actress says, “I play Barbie, who is emotional and positive. She is insecure about her weight and upset about the social mindset about an overweight girl. Bobby (Tushar) is pursuing her because she is rich.”
