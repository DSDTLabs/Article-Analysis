Patiala: Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Kirpal Singh Badungar on Thursday wrote a letter to all MPs to pressurise the Centre and the Punjab government to exempt GST on offerings made for provision of langar (community kitchen) service run by all religions.

 Earlier, Badungar had written to Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and the Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh demanding exemption from GST on purchases made by it for langar in the gurdwaras managed by it as the new tax had put an extra burden of Rs 10 crore it. He claimed that if need arose, he would also meet the members of GST council at the Centre.
 
 “The Prime Minister should listen to ‘Mann ki baat’ of the public. Narendra Modi had admitted that Khalsa Panth is a security cover of the nation while Jaitley had maintained that the country would have no existence had the ninth Sikh master Guru Teg Bahadur not sacrificed his life. Still there is discrimination with the Sikh community. Not only the gurdwaras but all shrines of other communities should also be given exemption from GST on the offerings for langar,” Badungar said who was in Patiala to attend a religious event at a local gurudwara.
