PANAJI: Chief minister Manohar   on Wednesday said his government is considering a proposal to expand the present size of type ‘A’ government   from the existing 36-38sqm to around 50sqm. Once the proposal is cleared, those occupying the ‘A’ type quarters will be shifted to temporary alternative accommodation till the existing quarters are demolished and rebuilt.

 “Needs have changed over the years. When the quarters were first built, there were no TVs and refrigerators in homes. Now families need more space,” Parrikar said. He was speaking after inaugurating the beautification works at an open space near the ‘A’ type quarters at Altinho.
 
 The CM said that another 40 MLD water treatment plant is coming up at Opa and that around 14,000sqm land has already been provided for the project. Stating that there is no water shortage in Goa, the CM said the new project is to further improve the drinking water supply.
 
 The state is also utilising around 45 MLD water from the   river, he said.
 
 CM said that repair work on bandharas that are in a bad shape will commence soon.
