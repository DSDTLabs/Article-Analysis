CHENNAI: The   on Monday said a magistrate court order closing a   case against actor   will be reopened as the lower court had not followed procedure.

 Justice M V  , who delivered the order, also directed metropolitan magistrate-VIII to spare the actor’s personal appearance in court, except on days when hearings in the case take place. The judge gave the direction while allowing a criminal revision petition filed by film financier S Mukanchand  .
 
 If the magistrate is taking cognizance of the complaint and issuing summons to Rajinikanth, “his appearance is dispensed with, except on the hearings to be ordered by the magistrate,” said Justice Muralidharan. He also directed the magistrate to follow procedure as per Section 203 of Criminal Procedure Code, which deals with dismissal of complaints and pass appropriate orders in the “unnumbered criminal complaint” filed by Bothra in 2015. He said it should be done within eight weeks.
 
 Bothra had filed a defamation case against Rajinikanth in 2015 for the latter’s alleged statement that he had attempted to extort money from him. The magistrate dismissed the petition as Bothra did not appear in court on the date of hearing.
 
 Setting aside the lower court’s order, Justice Muralidharan said the magistrate had not followed the procedure laid down in Section 203 of Criminal Procedure Code, which deals with dismissal of complaints.
