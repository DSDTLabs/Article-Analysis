NEW DELHI: The security at   has been beefed up since Thursday evening after convicted Indian Mujahideen terrorist   was shifted to this prison complex in connection with cases against him in Delhi. Bhatkal was given death sentence by a Hyderabad court in December.

 Earlier in 2015, security agencies had intercepted a call made by Bhatkal to his wife wherein he spoke about getting out of jail with help from Syria. Incidentally, this was not the first time Bhatkal made a reference to ISIS. When he was arrested at the Indo-Nepal border, he had raised his index finger, a signature pose of IS fighters.
 
 Sources said that Bhatkal had been lodged in jail number 1. Being a death-row convict, he has been kept in solitary confinement with guards and CCTVs keeping a watch on him round the clock. 
 
 He has been placed on “suicide watch” and will be given pajamas without strings. There will be no hooks on the ceiling and he will not be allowed to keep a gamcha (towel). He will be allowed to make telephone calls to his family twice a week.
 
 The former India chief of IM was in Hyderabad jail in 2015 when he made a call to his wife, saying he would be out soon with help from Damascus. The episode triggered fears about the jailed jihadi getting help from the dreaded terror outfit Islamic State.
 
 In the five-minute long chat, Bhatkal was heard telling his wife Zahida, “Damascus se log madad kar rahe hain. Mai jald hi riha ho jaoonga. (We are getting help from Damascus. I will be free soon). Bhatkal was learnt to have made 27 calls to his wife, who lives in Jamia Nagar, southeast Delhi. The agencies had learnt that the IM commander established contact with some anti-social elements he had met in judicial custody.
 
 In December 2016, an NIA special court awarded death sentence to Bhatkal and four others in Dilsukhnagar (Hyderabad) twin blasts cases. The others were identified as Tahseen Akhtar, Zia Ur Rehman alias Waqas, Asadullah Akhtar and Aizaj Sheikh.
