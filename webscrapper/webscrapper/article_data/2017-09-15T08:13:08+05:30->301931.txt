BENGALURU: Bowing to public pressure over the cutting of 112 trees for widening  , the   tree officer said all will be safely translocated to the pedestrian walkway adjacent to the boundary wall of  .

 Human chain protests, online petitions and 30,000 public responses against the treecutting probably forced the Palike to search for alternatives. As of now, 4 out of 112 trees have been successfully transplanted and 12 sa plings planted on Thursday itself. This is as per the translocation conditions, which state that 10-foot-high saplings must be planted in empty spaces between trees.
 
 Vijay Nishanth, conservationist and member of BBMP's tree committee, welcomed the move, saying it was encouraging that the civic agency could find an alternative to tree-felling.
 
 “We are happy people's power won, unlike in HAL recently where trees were cut for a civic project. The trees, for which we have to dig a ball of earth or a 2-metre area around it, have to be in proper condition. We have to treat the roots and tree with medicinesherbicides to prevent infection. It will also have to be fed with ample water and maintained for one year to take care of distress factors due to loss of roots,“ Nishanth said. Of the 112 trees, 61 are along the existing road while 51are within Palace Grounds.
 
 `No question of cutting trees'
 
 Shanta Kumar, additional conservator of forests, said there is no question of cutting trees now. “Of the 291along that stretch, BBMP engineers found a way to save 179; the fate of 112 is in question now. We have already transplanted four trees and will continue the process keeping in mind the rain situation. The ball of earth has to be stable, otherwise the process is a waste,“ he said.
 
 The trees are along a 2.5-km stretch from Mehkri Circle to Cantonment station.
