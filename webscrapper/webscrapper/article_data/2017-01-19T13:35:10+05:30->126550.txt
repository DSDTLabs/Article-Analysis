PANAJI: A three-member   committee headed by the state’s chief secretary, will examine proposals by any department before they are sent for approval to the   (ECI). The personnel department on Friday issued a circular advising government departments not to forward any reference directly to the ECI.

 With the model code of conduct already in force ahead of the February 4 polls, departments can’t seek approvals for new projects or recruit staff. However, if a new proposal warrants immediate attention, it has to be sent to the ECI for permission.
 
 The screening committee will now examine each such proposal before it is forwarded to the ECI, along with notings/comments from the chief electoral officer (CEO).
 
 Government departments have also been instructed not to submit original files to the CEO and to allow the commission at least 48 hours to process matters referring to matters where the model code of conduct applies.
