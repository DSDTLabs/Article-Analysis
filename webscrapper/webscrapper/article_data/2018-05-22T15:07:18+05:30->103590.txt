CALANGUTE: A student from Wardha, Maharashtra, is feared to have drowned at   beach on Monday. 

 
 PI   said that a group of five catering students, who had come to Goa on an assignment, had gone to the beach for a bath in the morning. 
 
 While three of them sat on the beach, two ventured into the water. When they were in waist-deep water, a massive wave suddenly hit them, throwing them off-balance and dragging them into the sea. Their friends on the beach immediately raised an alarm, following which lifeguards rushed to their rescue. One of them,  , was rescued, but his companion,  , 20, could not be traced.
 
 “When the wave hit us, we fell down and attempted to get up,” Lokhande told TOI. “I managed to get up and my companions held my hand. I was holding Ashish’s hand when another wave hit us and he fell down and disappeared into the water.” Drishti called off the search at 7pm. The search will continue on Tuesday.
