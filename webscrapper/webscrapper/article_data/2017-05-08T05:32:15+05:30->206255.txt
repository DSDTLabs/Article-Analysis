MUMBAI: Petrol pump owners' agitation will commence from this week. During the protest, the petrol pumps will observe a 'no purchase' day on Wednesday (May 10), when they will not buy stock but sell whatever they have. They will shut all operations, including   sale, on Sunday and take a 'day off'. And from May 15 onwards, the pumps will work in single shifts (9 am to 6 pm) only. This will continue for subsequent weeks, as they have announced an indefinite agitation. This could inconvenience scores of citizens and paralyse public transport in Mumbai. 

 Announcing that CNG pumps will also be shut during the protest, a senior member from Petrol Dealer's Association (PDA) in Mumbai said the dealers were "being pushed to the wall." "We were assured of a revision in dealer commission and this has been given in writing a few months ago. But the oil marketing   seem to have reneged on promise and are not even calling us for discussions," he said. 
 
 A source from the oil marketing companies, however, said petrol dealers will be called for a discussion in a couple of days, and efforts will be taken to ensure they do not shut services. 
 
  A pump owner said that as per calculations of the Apoorva Chandra committee report, dealers should be getting Rs 3,333 per kilo litre on petrol and Rs.2126/- per kilo litre on diesel. "We are currently getting Rs.2570 and Rs 1620 for petrol and diesel respectively," he pointed out.
