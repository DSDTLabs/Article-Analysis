PANAJI: While speculations about defence minister Manohar Parrikar’s return to state politics continue, it adds to the uncertainty surrounding BJP’s chief ministerial candidate for the assembly elections as the party hasn’t announced a CM candidate.

 Asked whether Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s statement on Thursday that if the party MLAs want even a leader in Delhi could be made the CM of   is true, Parrikar said, “I will cross the bridge when we reach it.”
 
 Speaking to reporters after Panaji MLA Sidharth Kuncalienker filed his nomination to contest assembly election from Panaji, Parrikar said, “Whatever Gadkari wanted to say, he has said and if you want any clarification then you should ask Gadkari.”
 
 The former chief minister also said if MLAs want me to return to state politics, then they should approach the central leadership.
 
 “It will be the decision of the parliamentary board whether I have to return to state politics,” Parrikar said after the question was posed to him again.
 
 Sources say that a couple of weeks ago, Parrikar told his close friend, at a function, that he will return to state politics, but did not elaborating much. The defence minister is said to have told his friend when the latter queried about his health.
 
 Parrikar is the key campaigner for the party in the state where Congress, an alliance of regional outfits, including one headed by a former   leader, and AAP are other players in the fray.
 
 Parrikar also said that   will win the assembly elections with absolute majority and that a post-poll alliance with the MGP will not be required. The BJP will win the Panaji seat with a margin higher than in the previous elections, he said.
