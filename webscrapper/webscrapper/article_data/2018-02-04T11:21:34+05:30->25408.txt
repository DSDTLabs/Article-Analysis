LUDHIANA: The body of a baby boy, said to be around eight months old, was found dumped in a dustbin of a school in Focal Point here on Friday evening. A case has since been registered at Focal Point police station, and an investigating is on. 

 A sweeper of the school noticed the body, concealed in a polythene bag, in a dustbin on the second floor of the school's building. A panel of doctors has been formed to carry out the post-mortem, and the report is expected by Sunday. Police have not found any injury on the body. 
 
 In her statment to the police, Urmila Devi, the school sweeper, said she found the body while cleaning up after the school had gotten over for the day. 
 
 The investigating officer, assistant sub-inspector  , said foul smell was emanating from the dustbin and it seemed the baby had died two-three days ago. "Either a teacher or an outsider has done this to defame the school; it is not easy for a student to carry an eight-month-old baby to school and dump it in the dustbin," he said. 
 
 The ASI said 28 CCTV cameras were installed on the school's premises and they had collected the hard disk of the recording device to scan all footage in detail. "It will take us a day or two to scan the footage thoroughly," he said.
 
 He said an FIR had been registered under Section 318 (concealment of birth by secret disposal of dead body) of the IPC.
 
 The sweeper raised alarm and called school authority after which the police was sounded. The Focal point police took the body in custody and sent to civil hospital.
