Kota: Police on Tuesday claimed to have solved the recent double murder mystery by arresting the accused from Shyopur area of Madhya Pradesh.

 Sohani Parashar (35) and her 12-year-old son Piyush were on Sunday evening shot dead at their home in Gali number 2, Chopda Farmhouse under Bhimganj Mandi police station area.
 
 Sohani’s husband Neeraj Parashar was in the market while his younger daughter was playing in other room at the time of crime.
 
 Chandra Kant Pathak alias Dilip (38), a resident of Murena district of Madhya Pradesh, was on Tuesday arrested from Shyopur (MP) for killing the mother-son duo on Sunday evening, said Kota city SP Anshuman Bhomia.
 
 Police had earlier lodged a case under Section 302 of IPC against an unidentified person in the matter but following the investigation, Dilip surfaced as the prime suspect, the SP said.
 
 The murdered woman had earlier gone to Bilaspur where she had stayed with Dilip for about two months. Her husband had lodged a missing report in this regard in Bhimganj Mandi police station.
 
 The woman had returned to her husband’s home in Kota only earlier this month, said police.
 
 Just to avenge his failure in love, the jilted lover had shot dead the woman at her home, said Govind Singh, SI at Bhimganj Mandi police station.
 
 The 12-year-old son, Piyush, also came in the room at that time and Pathak shot him too so that there was no eyewitness to the crime, he added.
 
 The murdered woman and the accused were neighbours in Murena. They had a love affair, the SI said, adding the woman was married to Neeraj Parashar 17 years back, but continued her relationship with the paramour. The accused is a contractor of electric items. The woman had lived with the accused for two months earlier and only on January 14, her husband had brought her back, said police. The accused would be produced before the court on Wednesday.
