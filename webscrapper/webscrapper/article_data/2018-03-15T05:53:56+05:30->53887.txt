DHARAMSHALA: The 105th edition of Indian   (ISC) in Manipur made the headlines stating that the Dalai Lama was supposed to attend this event with Prime Minister Narendera Modi at its inaugural session on March 16 and that the Tibetan spiritual leader was going to skip it. However, the Dalai Lama’s office on Wednesday clarified that it had not received any invitation for the event by the organizers.

 Earlier this week, there were reports that the Tibetan leader was going to skip the ISC event following the recent instructions of the Union government to senior leaders and government functionaries to stay away from Tibetan events planned to mark 60 years in exile of the Dalai Lama. The instructions underlined that this was a “sensitive time” for bilateral relations with China.
 
 Tenzin Takla, one of the private secretaries to the Dalai Lama, spoke to TOI on Wednesday, saying, “It is only through the news reports that we came to know about this development. No invitation has been received by this office. There was no communication with us regarding this.” 
 
 When contacted, the ICS office refused to comment on the issue. “All the officials are busy at the moment. They don’t have time till March 20. We cannot comment on this now,” said ICS information officer Indrani Das.
 
 Reports quoted ISC general president   saying that the Dalai Lama was invited and he would participate in the inaugural session with the Prime Minister. The ICS’s website had listed the Dalai Lama as one of the three Nobel laureates — Muhammad Yunus and Hiroshi Amano being the other two — who will participate in the event. However, the names were removed on Wednesday.
 
 Tseten Samdup, a representative of the Dalai Lama’s office, said the spiritual leader was already busy with “Mind & Life Conference’ at the moment. “It is the 33rd edition of dialogue of scientists with Buddhist scholars which started on March 12 and will conclude on the 16th of this month,” he said.
