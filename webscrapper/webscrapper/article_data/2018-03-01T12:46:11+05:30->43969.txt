A fixed deposit is a form of investment method offered by banks and several non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). In a fixed deposit, you deposit a certain amount of money for a fixed time period during which this money earns interest. Fixed deposit is a tried and tested way to increase your savings, as it gives a higher rate of interest than savings accounts. In addition to this, FDs are considered to be one of the safest investment options, as they are independent of market fluctuations, and returns on them are assured.
