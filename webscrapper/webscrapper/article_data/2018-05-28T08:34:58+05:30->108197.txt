IMPHAL: Police arrested 98 illegal immigrants from   on Sunday morning. Following a routine operation at the Nagamapal area in   West, police picked up the immigrants for not possessing identity cards, a police officer in Imphal West said. 

 The arrests comes after chief minister   instructed the police to intensify their drive to check inflow of illegal migrants in the state. Biren issued the instructions after cops recently busted two fake Aadhaar card manufacturing rackets in the state and many illegal immigrants, including Rohingya Muslims, were held from several parts of the state including Imphal city.
 
 One such racket was busted at the border town of Moreh a fortnight ago. Police also arrested a lady for allegedly manufacturing fake Aadhaar cards at her residence at Jiribam on March 25.
 
 To curb illegal immigrants, police have opened special check posts at Mao bordering Nagaland, Jiribam bordering Assam, and Moreh bordering Myanmar. Biren also recently said a bill will be tabled soon to propose the introduction of an Inner Line Permit-like regime in the state. The   has also stepped up its campaign to bring a strong law to protect the indigenous people of the state.
