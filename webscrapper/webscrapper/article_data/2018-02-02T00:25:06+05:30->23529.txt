Pune: Ramprasad Tathi, a 50-year-old labourer who had suffered severe burns after molten iron spilt on him and six others at a steel manufacturing plant on Wednesday morning, succumbed to his injuries at a private hospital on Wednesday night.

 Six other injured labourers are undergoing treatment. “The condition of Abujar Kalim Khan is stated to be critical,” said V K Nale, the assistant inspector of Yavat police, who is probing the case.
 
 The accident occurred when a container carrying the molten iron toppled while being shifted from one place to another with a crane in the plant located along Bhandgaon-Khor road. 
 
 Probe revealed that the container tilted due to some malfunction in the crane. The accident also caused an explosion in the plant. The Kurkumbh MIDC fire brigade doused the fire. 
 
 The Yavat police have registered an offence against plant owner, two managers and the crane operator. They have been booked under sections 337 and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Companies Act. One of the injured labourers, Santosh Pal (19), had lodged the complaint.
 
 Steel angles, round bars and channels are manufactured at the plant where the labourers work in two shifts. Around 35 labourers working in the night shift were present in the plant when the accident occurred around 7am on Wednesday.
 
 The accident also caused an explosion in the plant. The Kurkumbh MIDC fire brigade doused the fire.
 
 “Further investigation is on,” police said.
