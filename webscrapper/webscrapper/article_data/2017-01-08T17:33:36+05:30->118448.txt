PATNA: The state government has decided to hire 40 drones to film the longest   to be formed across Bihar on January 21 for creating awareness about liquor ban. The government has also written to   (ISRO) to capture the total 11,292km-long human chain through different satellites. 

 Director (mass education)  , who is also the nodal officer of the programme, said, “The ISRO has been requested to film the event through all the foreign satellites which will be crossing over Bihar at that time. We have also invited   and Guinness World Records to cover the human chain formation, which is likely to be the longest in history.”
 
 Jha said the Limca Book of Records has given its nod to cover the event. “We are waiting for approval from the Guinness World Records, which is figuring out the mechanism to cover such a long human chain,” he said, adding, “We don’t claim any certificate. We are doing this for a social cause with an aim to improve the living conditions of people in general.”
 
 The information and public relations department (IPRD) would provide a team to each district to cover the human chain formation through drones and video cameras. The teams would coordinate with the district magistrates concerned, he said. 
 
 At least 2,000 people would make one kilometre of human chain, which would cover two types of routes. The 3,011km-long main route would be without any break and would touch all the districts, whereas the sub-routes would cover villages and blocks and would be 8,285km-long.
 
 Jha further said one steward would supervise 400 persons for every 200 metres and prepare the list of participants to be submitted to each sector in-charge. One sector in-charge would supervise 5 stewards per km and obtain the list of 2,000 participants from stewards before submitting it to the block in-charge. Sector-wise attendance details would be recorded for the evidence purposes.
