MUMBAI: Around 35 students with special needs were recently locked out of their classrooms at a school in Borivli after a fallout between the management and the   running it.

 
 According to members of the Social Support Foundation, a parent group, they started the   in the premises of the   in June 2016. “The school authorities invited us to set up a school for students with special needs in their premises. We made an investment of Rs 25 lakh over six months and set up the school in the classrooms given to us. All was well until November 2017 when the school management tied up with an international school chain,” said  , founder of the foundation.
 
 The Divaang School, which imparts life skill training to students with special needs, used two classrooms and an occupational therapy centre. “We approached the civil court for a stay till we found a new place and the hearing was scheduled for Wednesday. But, suddenly on Monday, the school had locked the classrooms and did not allow us in. The children waited in the corridor near the toilets as they did their day’s work. On Tuesday, the security guards threatened us and stopped us from entering,” said a parent.
 
 “We have started looking for places but students cannot be moved out overnight. We were also promised that we could continue till April 30. We were paying a rent of Rs 33,000 per month and cheques for this were issued in the name of an individual and not the trust,” said Tayal.
 
 Abhaykumar Salunkhe, chairman of the school trust, said there was never an agreement with the NGO. “The NGO had convinced the headmaster of the school to allow them to operate in the premises, but the trust did not know about it. When we found out, we decided to ban the NGO from operating in the school because they did not have the necessary credentials. We run over 300 schools in the state so why would we require them to start a centre for us?” he said.
