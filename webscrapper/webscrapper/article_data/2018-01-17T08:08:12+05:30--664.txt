NAGAPATTINAM: Kaanum Pongal celebrations turned tragic for five youths in   district on Tuesday as they drowned in the sea off the Vedaranyam coast while engaging in a swimming competition organised by themselves. Five other youths were admitted to government hospitals in a critical condition. Fishermen along with fire and rescue services personnel rescued 10 others. 

 The incident happened when around 20 youths hailing from   village took to the sea on a fibre boat owned by   as part of a swimming competition. They reached about 1.50 nautical miles off Arukattuthurai on the Vedaranyam coast. As planned earlier, all of them were to jump into the water and compete to swim to the coast. However, as the "starting point" they chose for the competition was allegedly full of sediment deposits in the sea floor, more than 10 youths got stuck in it after jumping into the water.
 
 Sensing danger, the youths who were remaining on the boat informed fishermen in the area who in turn rushed there and tried to pull the youths out. The bodies were sent to Vedharanyam hospital for postmortem. State minister for handloom and textile O S Manian, Nagapattinam MLA   and revenue divisional officer   visited the hospital and consoled the relatives of the victims. Vedharanyam police have registered a case and are investigating.
