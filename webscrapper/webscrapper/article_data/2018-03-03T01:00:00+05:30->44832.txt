Aleya, a prominent ad filmmaker, who has won a Dadasaheb Phalke Award for her ad film, says, “When you are in school, your idea of love stems from what you see around you or from books and films. But as you mature, you realise that love has different dimensions. My film delves into these issues.”

 Ask Aleya how it was working with   and  , who play the characters Koroli Nair and Sumit Uppal in the film, and she says, “They share a natural chemistry. They bond very well off screen, so it was great to explore this chemistry onscreen.”
 
 The filmmaker, who hails from Delhi, feels that it’s tough to make inroads in Bollywood. She says, “I have been working for many years and it is lot of hard work. But even though I am from Delhi, I’ve never felt like an outsider here. I enjoy doing ad films and hopefully, the audience will like my work in films too.”
