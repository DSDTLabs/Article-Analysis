KOCHI: Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials from Kochi unit questioned a Murshidabad-based   Muhammad Inamul Haque. He was brought to Kochi on Monday night in connection with a case where he had allegedly paid Rs 45.3 lakh as bribe to Jibu D Mathew, a Malayali   who was arrested by the   earlier this year.

 
 “We arrested Haque from Kolkata on Monday based on the FIR registered in Kochi following the arrest of Mathew. We will produce the accused in   on Wednesday,” a CBI official said.
 
 Jibu Mathew, a commandant of the 83rd Battalion of the   posted in Roshanbagh in Mushidabad district of West Bengal, was arrested by the CBI on January 30 this year at Alappuzha railway station. The CBI officials also recovered Rs 45.3 lakh kept in denominations of 2,000 and 500 from him.
 
 Mathew was in charge of 83rd battalion of BSF, which is mandated for securing the border with Bangladesh in Murshidabad. This 70-km stretch is known for smuggling of cattle, drugs, fake Indian currency notes and human trafficking.
 
 The CBI said Mathew had been extending favours to smugglers and facilitating illegal activities after accepting money.
 
 During interrogation, Mathew told officials that he had received the money from a person called Bishu Sheikh as gratification for the favours the BSF official had extended to the smuggler. But the CBI officials found that the name Bishu Sheikh was a fake one and his original name was Muhammad Inamul Haque.
 
 Haque was already under the scanner of several investigation agencies for his alleged role in inter-border cattle smuggling. The CBI arrested him when he reached Kolkata from Dhaka.
 
 For the last 15 years, he has been playing a major role in controlling cattle smuggling across the border. Haque started with money exchange and gradually shifted to cattle smuggling. Last month, state labour minister of West Bengal Jakir Hussain had complained that Haque had threatened him.
