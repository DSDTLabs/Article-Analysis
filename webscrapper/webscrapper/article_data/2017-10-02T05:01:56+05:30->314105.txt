 (Kamal has said he intends to start his own party .) Rajinikanth said “there needs to be something more than fame and wealth“ for success in politics. “Only the people know what that is. I promise I don't know. I think   Haasan knows what that is. Even if he does, he will not tell me,“ he joked Kamal would have told him what that is, Rajinikanth said, had he asked him two months earlier. Kamal had in July started attacks on “corruption“ in government.“When I asked him what that is, Kamal Haasan said he will tell me if I joined him.“
 
 Kamal, who took the stage next, didn't comment on Rajinikanth's speech.
