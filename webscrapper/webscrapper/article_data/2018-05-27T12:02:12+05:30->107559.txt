TRICHY: Two days after a man was arrested for lobbing a bag containing a knife inside   Ranganathar temple, Mannarkudi Sendalankara Senbagamannar  , a Vaishnavaite mutt head, on Saturday, criticized the Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) department for allegedly not respecting the customs of Hindu religion.

 Jeeyar lashed out at the officials of the HR&CE by citing Thursday’s incident when a 27-year-old man, R Tharmaraj from   in Thanjavur was arrested by the Srirangam police on charges of criminal intimidation to the temple employees when he was questioned for throwing the bag on   near the sanctum sanctorum in the temple on Thursday morning.
 
 “A man hurled a bag with slippers inside Srirangam temple. It is a trial by those who are hostile towards Hindu religion and its customs. The officials are covering up the incident by saying that he threw only dirty clothes. They are trying to keep such incidents under the wraps in several temples,” Jeeyar told the reporters on Saturday in a press meet at the temple premises. The Jeeyar also pointed out the recent incident of a group of nuns visiting the Srirangam temple. Their visit caused ripples after someone alleged that they read the Bible in the temple, he added.
 
 “Whenever such incidents happen, HR&CE officials are not bothered about the customs. They are particular about making money. So, the department should leave from all the temples in the state,” said the Jeeyar.
 
 Raising concern about the safety of the temples, the Jeeyar said that the temple administration caused inconvenience to the devotees and disrespected the temple and its customs instead of questioning such people.
