SURI: His flip-flop the day before notwithstanding,   Khan on Tuesday reiterated at his   home, barely three kilometers from Suri, that their family supported the Trinamool Congress and his son Dildar was murdered by   supporters. Touhid had first claimed his son was a BJP worker killed by Trinamool. He then changed his statement to claim that his son was a Trinamool supporter killed by BJP. On Tuesday, however, he remained consistent.

 With senior Trinamool leaders flocking at their home and a good number keeping an eye on the family, Dildar’s elder brother Samsher said, “Our family is known in the area as Trinamool Congress supporters. The death of my brother is a great shock to us. My wife went there to file nomination as a Trinamool candidate. Trinamool leaders have come to our house. They promised to help us and stand beside us. My brother has three minor daughters. Now we are in need of some financial and other help. My sister-in-law is also in distress. Right now, we don’t want to talk much.”
 
 Police deployment at the village kept the tensions from flaring up on Tuesday. The body of Dildar was buried late on Monday night.   leaders attended the last rites. Implicated in Touhid’s FIR, BJP workers were not found anywhere in the village on Tuesday. Local BJP leader  , who also received bullet injuries and against whom Touhid had lodged complaint, was taken to an unknown hospital by the BJP leaders for treatment. No one has been arrested till Tuesday evening. Garai’s wife on Tuesday lodged a police complaint alleging Trinamool supporters had attacked her husband.
