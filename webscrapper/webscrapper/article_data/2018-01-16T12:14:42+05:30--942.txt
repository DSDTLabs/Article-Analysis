CHANDIGARH: At a time when efforts should be made for greater coordination among local administrations of Tricity, the heads of municipal corporations don’t seem to care much.

 A   of the municipal commissioners of the Tricity was scheduled to take place on Monday, on finding solutions to the stray animal menace, but the commissioners of   and Panchkula did not turn up.
 
 While Panchkula commissioner Rajesh Jogpal didn’t come, Mohali commissioner   sent joint municipal commissioner Avneet Kaur in his place.
 
 A Chandigarh MC official said had become meaningless in the absence of the two bureaucrats. “Both Panchkula and Mohali commissioners did not come for the meeting. It was pointless to discuss issues in their absence, so we wrapped up early,” said a Chandigarh MC official. The short meeting was chaired by Chandigarh municipal commissioner Jitender Yadav. “Initially, the meeting was on January 8, but it was cancelled and fixed on Monday. Panchkula commissioner and his   were informed well in advance and a letter was also sent to them. Still, no official came from Panchkula. It was Jogpal, who had requested for the meeting,” said an official of Chandigarh MC. 
 
 The meeting was called to discuss a number of common issues faced by Tricity residents, especially the stray dog and cattle menace.
 
 The MCs of Panchkula, Mohali and Chandigarh have been blaming each other for the growth in stray cattle and dog population in their areas. According to officials, in this meeting, a common cattle pool for the tricity and measures to stop stray dog menace were to be discussed.
 
 When contacted, Panchkula MC commissioner Rajesh Jogpal said that he was not informed about the meeting.
 
 “The meeting I proposed was fixed on January 8, but Chandigarh MC officials postponed the meeting. Nor my office nor was I informed about the meeting on Monday. I received a call from Chandigarh MC office around 3pm, when I was at a inauguration function,” he said.
