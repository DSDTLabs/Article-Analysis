Aamir Khan's ' ', which also stars Fatima Sana Shaikh, Sanya Malhotra, Sakshi Tanwar, Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar in key roles, is proving to be unstoppable at the box-office, four weeks into its release. New films like 'OK Jaanu', Nawazuddin Siddiqui's 'Haraamkhor' and Deepika Padukone's 'xXx: Return of Xander Cage', proved to be no match for the wrestling-themed film as business doubled on Saturday compared to its collections on Friday (January 13). The film has reportedly collected an estimated Rs 4.06 core, thus taking its total to a new high of Rs 365.87 crore. 
 
 
  
 'Dangal', which tells the story of Indian wrestler and coach Mahavir Singh Phogat and how he trained his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari to become world-class wrestlers, also became the first Bollywood film to cross the 360-crore mark and is the highest grossing film in Hindi cinema.
 
 
 
 With trade experts predicting a rise in collections on Sunday, it remains to be seen if the film will cross the Rs 400-crore mark in its lifetime collection in the domestic market.
