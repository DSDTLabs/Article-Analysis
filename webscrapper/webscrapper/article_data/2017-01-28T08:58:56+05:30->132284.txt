AURANGABAD: To make the nation-wide pulse   slated on Sunday a success, the civic body has decided to set up a counter at   and zoo premises, where the entry will be free of cost for children between 0-5 years of age and their parents. In a first, the municipal authorities have set up special teams of doctors and paramedical staff to administer the polio doses during the late evening hours. 

 The municipal authorities will kick-start the drive in a ceremony to be held in the garden at 9am. Aurangabad divisional commissioner   will inaugurate the event. 
 
 AMC’s medical health officer   told TOI that the civic body is hoping to cover all the kids falling in the bracket of 0 to 5 years. “We want to make the drive memorable for the parents and have thus decided to not charge anything from them at the zoo. It will help us cover a large number of kids,” he said. 
 
 “We cannot afford to ignore kids who are travelling on Sunday. Hence, we have set up teams that will be active during the night hours as well. The team members have been directed to visit bus stands and administer the drops to kids around the area,” he said. 
 
 “The civic body will set up 614 booths in the city. These booths will be located at strategic locations so that parents can take their kids to the nearest booth comfortably. Schools, colleges, commercial complex, theatres, markets, community halls, residential complexes and other similar places have been selected as important spots for the booths,” he said. 
 
 The authorities have set a target of administering polio drops to 1,96,839 children falling between 0 to 5 years in the municipal limits on January 29.
 
 A team of 1,831 employees including 115 supervisors and 32 medical officers in the municipal body will be involved in the drive. In addition to this, volunteers from various organisations and members of self-help groups will also assist the authorities in accomplishing the task.
