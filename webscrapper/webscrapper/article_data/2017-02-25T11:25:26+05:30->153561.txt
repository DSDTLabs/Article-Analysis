Composing music for a romantic film is starkly different from making songs for an out-and-out action flick. And, music director   realised this right at the beginning of his career. 
Mannan, who debuted with 'Commando: A One Man Army', is happy with the response his latest outing, ' :  ' has already garnered. 
 
 Though both movies belong to the same genre, their music does not have much in common. He elaborates, “While the first film had a raw, desi feel, this one is urban-centric. Giving an action film a musical value was a big challenge.” 
 Surprisingly, the 29-year-old does not use digitalised formats, rather goes the live music way, which he feels is his USP. “In Tere Dil Mein, 80 per cent of my work is live — I have used a 16-piece orchestra for strings, and acoustic, electric guitars.” 
 
  
  
 
 Mannan was five when he began his training in classical music. He says that he is grateful to his first guru, late  , for bringing out the composer in him. Spending two years as Pritam’s assistant also helped. “Pritam would compose 400 songs in four-five hours. He even made me sing two songs in Kucch Luv Jaisaa. In fact, for the reprise of Seedha Saadha in Commando 2, Vipul (Shah) wanted me to sing, but I insisted on Jubin (Nautiyal). I am a critic of my own voice. I’ve always loved composing, though my mom wanted me to be a singer,” he signs off.
