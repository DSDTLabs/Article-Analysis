NEW DELHI: Punjab minister   was full of praise for a reticent   on Sunday and said the former Prime Minister’s “silence” did what the ruling BJP’s “uproar” could not.

 At the 84th plenary session of the Congress here, Sidhu, a former BJP MP who often targeted the former PM over his reluctance to speak on issues, apologised to Manmohan. Sidhu, in his speech peppered with poetry and witty remarks, said Singh was both “Sardar (a Sikh) and asardar (effective)”. “I want to apologise to   and that too bowing down... Your silence has done what BJP’s uproar could not. I realised this after 10 years, sir,” said the cricketer-turnedpolitician, who joined Congress before Punjab assembly polls in 2017.
 
 Lauding the former PM, Sidhu said the economy galloped like an Arabian horse when he was the PM. “Whereas,” he said, “under BJP's rule, the economy is moving at the pace of a tortoise.”
 
 “Sir, you worked hard silently in such a way that your success created an uproar. Sir, you are a Sardar and also asardar (effective),” a comment which had former Congress chief   and senior party leader Ashok Gehlot, who flanked Singh, giggling.
 
 Sidhu hailed former party president Sonia Gandhi, party president   and Congress workers in his speech. He said Rahul was set to unfurl the tricolour from the ramparts of the Red Fort after becoming the country's prime minister post the 2019 general election. Sidhu said the BJP's lies stood exposed after its four-year rule. "They (BJP) appear tall, but are hollow like bamboo from inside. I have seen them from close quarters. And Rahul Bhai is like sugar cane, sweet from within and outside," he said.
 
 Hailing Congress workers, Sidhu likened them to Sikandar (Greek emperor Alexander the Great) and said the party cannot be what it is without them. “Sikandar (workers) does not bow before the situation...the workers are soul, life and identity of the party,” he added.
