SILIGURI: After the all-party meeting at ‘Uttarkanya’ in   on Tuesday, Bengal chief minister   announced two cultural boards: ‘Kamtapuri Bhasa Academy’ and ‘Rajbanshi Development and Cultural Board’.

 The move is an effort to address the problems of Rajbanshis, who have been fighting for a separate state and recognition of their language.
 
 “This has been a long-standing demand of the Rajbanshis. There is another organization — Rajbanshi Bhasa Academy — and we will have to do something with both organisations,”   said.
 
 “What is the point in creating a separate organisation when there is already one? She (Banerjee) is trying to plug the grievances of the Rajbanshis but our original problem is not addressed,” said a Rajbanshi Academy member.
