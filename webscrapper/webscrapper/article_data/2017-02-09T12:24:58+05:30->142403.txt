RANCHI: Notices will be served to nearly 90% of the houses constructed illegally in   of Namkom,   Rural Development Authority ( ) chairman   said on Wednesday. 

 “There are over 2,000 houses in the area and 90% of the houses did not get their building plans sanctioned by the RRDA, thus making them illegal,” Singh said.
 
 This came after, based on a tip-off, the chairman conducted a surprise inspection in the area. As per government rules, if a house is constructed under the RRDA area without the RRDA’s sanction, the owner will have to pay a fine of Rs 1,000 per square feet. Thus, if a house is constructed on an area of 1,200 square feet, the owner of the property will have to pay a fine of Rs 12 lakh to get the building plan regularized. 
 
 “I have asked my team to survey the area and prepare a list of the total number of houses and   in the area within 10 days. Once I get the list, notices will be issued to the respective owners,” Singh said.
 
 He added, “The house will be demolished if the owner fails to pay the fine on time.”
 
 The RRDA chairman also said the whole colony was built in an unplanned manner. As per norms, there should be a gap of at least 15 feet between two houses. However, in this colony, Singh said, the gap between the two houses was not more than two feet. “The houses are so close to each other that if one house catches fire, the entire colony will burn down,” Singh said. 
 
 Singh said the RRDA would continue organising such inspections in the future. “Areas like Namkom, Tatisilvai, Tupudana, Pundag and others come under RRDA’s jurisdiction. We will continue arranging surprise visits to these areas to keep a check on illegal constructions,” Singh said.
