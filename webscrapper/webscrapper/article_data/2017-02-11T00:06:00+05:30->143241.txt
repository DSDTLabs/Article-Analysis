Mhow:The 159th death anniversary of King Bakhtawar Singh was observed as martyrdom day at Amjhera town on Friday. 

 Hundreds of students from several schools gathered at the gate of Amjhera palace and then took out a rally. They also raised slogans praising his commitment to people, valour and sacrifice. 
 
 After the rally, the participants went inside the palace and garlanded a statue of him. Dhar Member of Parliament Savitri Thakur along with other senior leaders was also present on the occasion. 
 
 Later, children sang songs on Singh. The local leaders of both congress and BJP met the MP and told her about the dilapidated condition of the palace despite the fact that it is under the state Archeological Survey of India (ASI). Thakur assured that she will raise the issue before the authorities concerned so that Amjhera could get its due place in the rich Indian history and the palace could be revamped.
 
 Swaraj Sansthan of cultural department organised a musical concert in the memory of Singh at the Amjhera bus stand at evening.
 
 Unlike the other princely states of the country, the royal history of Amjhera under Dhar district is very unique. Singh was hanged to death at the present MTH compound in Indore on February 10, 1858 since he had refused to surrender before the British and enter into a treaty with them.
 
  Local activist Abhijeet Pandit said that earlier big leaders and even the chief minister would come to Amjhera to pay tributes to the great martyr. “Babulal Gaur was the last CM to come here because of which ASI and administration doesn’t pay the required attention to this invaluable heritage,” he claimed.
