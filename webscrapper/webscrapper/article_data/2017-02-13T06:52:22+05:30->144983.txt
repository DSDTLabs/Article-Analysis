SITAPUR: Barely three days before the second phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh,   chief   on Sunday came up with a   to the voters including waiver of up to Rs 1lakh of loan taken by farmers, constitution of a special commission to resolve traders' problems, launching a special drive against landgrabbers and getting FIRs registered against goons and the mafia.

 The announcement came close on the heels of the BJP-led government in the Centre waiving off two-month interest on loans taken by farmers from cooperative banks.
 
 Addressing a rally in Sitapur, Mayawati said there had been instances of farmers being harassed by banks and the problem needed immediate redressal. Ironically , it was during the BSP government in UP the cases of farmers committing suicide in drought-hit Bundelkhand mainly because of alleged harassment by bank officials -had spiraled. It was one of the reasons behind BSP's ouster in 2012 as sembly elections.
 
 Mayawati also rea ched out to traders and businessmen, often re ferred as the traditional vote bank of BJP , promising constitution of a special commission to look into their problems. The BSP supremo said the opposition was conspiring by fuelling concocted opinion polls to show BSP at the bottom of the poll graph. Appealing to her supporters not to fall in the “trap“, Mayawati said similar opinion polls had emerged in 2007 too.
