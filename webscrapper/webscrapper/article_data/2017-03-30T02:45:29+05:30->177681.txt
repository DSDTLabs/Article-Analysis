MUMBAI: Union shipping minister   will inaugurate 165   blocks allotted by the Mumbai Port Trust to   Memorial Centre to be made available free of charge to outstation child   patients. 

 “Most children suffering from cancer and coming for treatment to Tata Memorial   from all over the country do not have any place to stay. They end up staying on the pavements outside the hospital. They need hygienic staying conditions to protect them from infections,” an MBPT spokesperson said.
