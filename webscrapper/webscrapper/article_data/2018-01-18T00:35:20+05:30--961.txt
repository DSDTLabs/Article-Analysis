Coimbatore: It is not often that a citizen gets to meet several bureaucrats from various departments under one roof. Residents and corporates, who are members of ‘Namma Kovai’, got that opportunity on Wednesday and shared solutions for various problems that the city faced. The group was started on WhatsApp by NGOs in 2015.

 Issues on roads being dug up, delay in construction of flyover, traffic enforcements, upgradation of airport facilities and other issues of the city were discussed by the 50-odd participants who attended the meeting. Various solutions to problems such as traffic on Gandhipuram were also discussed. City-based architect Arun Prasad requested corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan if he could prepare a proposal for a subway and submit it to him. The commissioner obliged and asked him to come up with the solutions.
 
 Deputy commissioner (traffic) of police Sujith Kumar requested the residents to come forward and adopt roads for developing them. He asked the corporates to use their funds and set up CCTV cameras and paint medians. Residents also came forward to take up the maintenance of traffic islands. Reducing accidents involving two-wheelers was another hot topic and the commissioner sought the help of the residents to take it up.
 
 Coimbatore airport director R Mahalingam requested the NGOs to undertake planting trees to beautify the airport.
