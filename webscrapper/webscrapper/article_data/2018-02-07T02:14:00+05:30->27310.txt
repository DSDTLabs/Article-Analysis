Vijayawada: In a tragic incident, a third year B.Tech (information and technology) student of NRI College committed suicide by jumping off the college building at Potavarappadu under Agiripalli mandal in Krishna district on Sunday night. Cops identified the deceased as Sheik Rehaman (21), a native of Tilak Nagar area in Hyderabad, Telangana.

The warden went to see Rehaman him in his room but did not find him there. About 15 minutes later, locals informed the warden that someone had fallen down from the backside of the building.
 
 The warden and Rehaman’s friends rushed there and found him in an unconscious state.

 Rehaman was the younger son of Yusuf who owns and manages a book store in Hyderabad. Yusuf said that they do not have any problems.
 
 The Agiripalle police have registered a case under Section 174 of CrPC. The body was handed over to Yusuf after post-mortem examination was conducted at the government hospital on Monday.
