The city’s LGBTQ community recently organised ‘Queer Carnival 2018’ at   City. Attended by activists and leaders of the transgender and queer community to spread awareness about their issues, the carnival saw various cultural programmes being performed by the members along with discussions to sensitise the people about the challenges faced by the community. The highlight of the one-day event was the launch of ‘P Sircle’, a non-profit organisation for the parents of the community in the city. Also present at the event was   writer   and fashion designer  . The carnival is one of the many events scheduled to be organised in the city as a build-up to the Hyderabad Queer Pride March to be held on February 18.
