Udhagamandalam: The Nilgiris collector has accepted an offer of a voluntary organisation to maintain a public toilet ( ) at Charing Cross in Ooty to showcase it as a   for the other toilets in the hilltown. 

 The voluntary organisation, ‘Make Ooty Beautiful’ (MOB), has extended the offer as many public toilets are badly maintained in the town. “The main problem is Namma toilets in the town are badly maintained. Many people complain about them. But the people are main cause for the bad condition of the toilets,” said Shobana Chadrashekar, founder of MOB, who added that the number of toilets in the town is not sufficient. 
 
 Shobana said good maintenance of the toilets by the municipality would solve the problem. But as the toilets have been leased out to private players. So, the volunteers of MOB called on J Innocent Divya and discussed their willingness to maintain one of toilets to make it a model one. The collector instantly accepted the offer. 
 
 “We chose the toilet near Charing Cross as it is the entry point of the town. We want to have the model toilet there. It is nothing but merely checking the   of the toilet after every use,” said Shobhana.
 
 On Tuesday, the volunteers of MOB in association with volunteers from Deenatty village headed by Subramani of Gawa Trust and employees of Delitz Inn worked for more than three hours to clean the toilet.
 
 “Natural cleaners such as lime and vinegar were used in order to minimize the impact on water bodies,” said Shobana.
 
 The organisation is plaaning to renovate an abandoned toilet building near Charing cross and convert it into an art gallery. “The abandoned toilet next to the Namma toilet will be cleaned up and turned into an art gallery in order to create a facelift for the whole area,” said Shobana. “In this regard, a letter will be sent to the municipality soon,” she added.
