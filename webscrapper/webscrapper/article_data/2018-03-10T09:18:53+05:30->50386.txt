IDUKKI: For the first time in the history of the  , the curia of the   has requested   to keep major archbishop   out of his official duties in the church. On Friday, the priests’ group submitted a petition in this regard to auxiliary bishop  , asking him to send it immediately to the Pope.

 The curia comprises the major archbishop, two auxiliary bishops, two vicar generals, chancellor, vice-chancellor, pastoral council co-ordinator, procurator and archdiocesan institutional central office director.
 
 
 Recently, the Syro-Malabar Church had decided to transfer the administrative powers of the Ernakulam-Angamali archdiocese from cardinal and major archbishop George Alanchery to auxiliary bishop Sebastian Adyanthrath. It is learnt that the petition will be sent to the Pope at the earliest. With the administrative power handed over to the auxiliary bishop, there is no need for approval from the major archbishop to send the complaint to the Pope, said sources.
 
 “The curia is the final decision-taking body of the archdiocese and its decision is final. We want the Pope to keep the major archbishop away from his official duties until the issues are settled,” said Fr Benny Maramparmpil.
 
 Normally, when a complaint is received from the curia, the Pope will hand it over to the secretary of the state who will conduct an inquiry through Apostolic Nuncio of India. As per his report, the Pope will direct the major archbishop to keep away from the official duties of the archdiocese. In some cases, the Vatican would immediately summon the cardinal to Rome and appoint him to some other congregation, said the sources.
 
 “The church is facing such a situation for the first time and we hope the Pope will appoint an administrative archbishop for the archdiocese to solve the issue,” said the priest.
