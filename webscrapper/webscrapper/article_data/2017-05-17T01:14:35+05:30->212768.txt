MUMBAI: If some of your affluent Muslim friends are missing from the city this  , chances are they may have gone to Mecca for  , also called mini-Haj.

 As  , the holy month of fasting, coincides with summer vacation this year—it comes 11 days earlier than the previous year as it follows the lunar calendar and this year it begins on May 27—tour operators are flooded with requests for bookings. “Last year, we booked around 400 pilgrims for Umrah in Ramzan. But this year, we have already booked 800 pilgrims and there are many more days are to go before Ramzan begins,” said   of Al-Khalid Tours and Travels. He added that the last 10 days of Ramzan would see a bigger rush since more people want to be in the holy precincts; hotel accommodation in Mecca on these 10 days costs between Rs 40,000 and Rs 1 lakh a night per person. Umrah costs a pilgrim at least Rs 1 lakh.
 
 Actor   is headed for Umrah with six members of her family. “For the past four years, I have made it to Umrah during Ramzan. I put all my works and commitments on hold during Ramzan and I must say I don’t suffer any financial loss,” said Khan. “It brings blessings and helps bring more work during the rest of the year.” 
 
 Film producer Sajid Nadiadwala’s wife  , who plans to do Umrah with her family, said, “This year, Ramzan is coinciding with summer vacation and Umrah pilgrimage suits my two sons. We will be on Umrah in the last 10 days of Ramzan. I organize tarawih (special namaz in Ramzan at night) for women and hope my sister will take charge while I am away.”
 
 “The Prophet said performing Umrah during Ramzan is like performing Haj with him. Hence, there is so much rush for Umrah during Ramzan,” said senior cleric Maulana Rizwan Khan.
