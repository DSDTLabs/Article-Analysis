MUMBAI: The stock in the seven lakes that supply water to Mumbai has dipped compared to last year. As on April 21, the total stocks stood at 4.85 lakh million litres as compared to 4.95 lakh million litres on the same date last year.

 Civic officials say this should not be a reason to worry as the lakes have enough water to meet the city’s needs till the end of July.
 
 The city receives its water from seven lakes.
 
 Civic officials said that daily around 3,800 million litres of water is brought to the city from the seven lakes. Last year, however, owing to a good monsoon there were no water cuts imposed over Mumbai and total water stocks remained the best when compared to the previous two years. By September 2017, the total water had reached the full supply level as well.
 
 An official from BMC’s hydraulic department said the difference in water stocks compared to last year is very meagre. “During summers, the consumption of water too is a little more compared to the other times. The meteorological department has also forecast normal monsoon for the year and therefore we are hoping that there should not be a problem,” said the official.
 
 Deputy municipal commissioner   said they make some provisions only if the rainfall is not normal in the first 15 days of monsoon. This year with a normal monsoon being forecast, they are hopeful there should not be a problem.
