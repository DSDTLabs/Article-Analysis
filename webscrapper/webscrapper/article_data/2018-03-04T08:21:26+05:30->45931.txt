HYDERABAD: Did the   get permission to take up digging work with vibration-causing excavators in the buffer or protected zone around the historic Charminar? 

 The civic body claims that it has taken up digging with machines in the buffer zone as part of the Charminar Pedestrianisation Project (CPP) with "permission and NoC from the Archaeological Survey of India ( )". But the permission letter issued by the competent authority under the National Monuments Authority ( ) Act for   works does no where mention about the digging. Even a cursory look at the letter nails the  's lie.
 
 The letter (Lr. No. NMA-CA-TS-HYD/73/2011) issued on April 28, 2016, grants permission only for 'providing granite pavement'. It also makes it clear that GHMC should obtain "other clearances/NOCs from relevant agencies". But, the letter failed to name the officer, who would supervise the works. Clause (D) of Rule 16 (conditions of licence) lays down the condition that operations "shall be conducted under the supervision of the director named in the licence who shall be present at the excavation operations for at least three-fourths of the period of the operations".
 
 Moreover, the permission obtained by GHMC is bounded by the condition that "work shall be executed strictly as per plan and terms and conditions of NMA". Though permission was given for providing granite pavement, the road is dug up to lay sewer pipelines. For reasons best known to the authorities concerned, the new sewer pipelines are connected to an ancient underground network, probably created during the Asaf Jahi period to drain out the rainwater falling on the Charminar.
 
 Meanwhile, two teams - ASI and Intach - inspected the excavation works on Saturday. Intach Hyderabad convenor P   said the new pipelines are being connected with a manhole close to the monument. "I spent four hours to inspect the works. I also interacted with the locals. It is clear that no conservation management plan is in place," she said.
