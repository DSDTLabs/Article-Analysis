AHMEDABAD: Almost a decade ago, an unwary  , 45, had encountered a life-threatening trap -a kite string had almost slit his throat, while he was heading home on his bike.The incident led him to take up his personal crusade of making people safe during Uttarayan. For the last 10 years, Bhavsar has been climbing light poles a few days prior to Uttarayan along 15 flyovers, rail bridges and river bridges to tie   which will protect   from  .

 Bhavsar has now appealed to the municipal corporation to carry out a similar drive on all important arterial roads, where such accidents take place. A few of his friends assist Bhavsar in his work. This time, his son, Vaibhav has also joined in. 
 
 On Wednesday, Bhavsar climbed the last of the city's rail bridges in   he had not secured, and completed his task. “The fire department and the private contractor for streetlights help me each year by providing their vehicles and their hydraulic snorkels for tying these iron lines,“ says Bhavsar. In fact, Bhavsar spends Rs 3,500 per bridge on tying these iron lines. “I am an air-conditioner engineer and have the knack of tying electric cables. I thought I could use my skills he re,“ said Bhavsar. He also claims that the lines have to be replaced every year due to rust, while in many cases, the lines are removed during annual maintenance of streetlights. Bhavsar claims that in the last few weeks, many residential societies from different areas of the city have approached him to replicate the model along busy roads, and have also volunteered to assist him.
