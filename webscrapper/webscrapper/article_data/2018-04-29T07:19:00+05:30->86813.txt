Ludhiana: Ludhiana police have arrested an unauthorized travel agent and booked his wife for allegedly duping 250 people of Rs 35 lakh in the past two-and-a-half years on the pretext of getting them work permit and visa for countries like Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and England. 

 The police have also recovered Rs 5.38 lakh, 45 passports, receipts, bank statements, stamps and other documents from the agent, identified as Paramjit Singh of Noorwala Road. His wife Baljeet Kaur is absconding. 
 
 Additional deputy commissioner of police (special branch) Surendra Lamba said the accused had been running a firm ‘BDS Overseas Company’ near ESI Hospital since the past two-and-a-half years. They used to advertise about their firm in newspapers to attract youngsters willing to go abroad. 
 
 ADCP Lamba said, “The accused would first ask clients to get Rs 1,000 deposited in the company’s bank account. Further they would take around Rs 14,000 for completing medical procedures and later would ask for Rs 25,000 for work permit. However, the duo never gave any payment receipt and would promise to hand over works permit within two months.”
 
 The official added, “Since the accused were not authorized, they could not get the visas for their clients. When clients used to ask for visa and passport, the accused used to say their work permit has been rejected.”
 
 Police said the accused confessed to have duped over 250 people of Rs 35 lakh.
 
 Ravi Kumar, SHO, Shimlapuri police station, said the couple used to lure clients saying that their daughter is herself studying in Canada. 
 
 Police have received six more complaints against the accused from Jalandhar and Haryana.
 
 The Shimlapuri police have filed a case against the couple under Sections 420, 120-B of the IPC and Section 13 of the Punjab Travel Profession Regulation Act-2012.
