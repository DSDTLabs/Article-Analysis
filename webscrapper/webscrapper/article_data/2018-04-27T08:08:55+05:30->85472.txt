THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As many as 32,020 people had to surrender their driving licences, following the stringent action taken by the motor vehicles department ( ) on traffic violators in the period from January, 2017 to March, 2018. The measures to reduce road accidents were initiated following the directive of   on Road Safety. The SC panel had asked MVDs in all states to suspend licences of traffic violators for a period not less than three months.

 
  
 
 
 While the directive was issued in October, 2016, it was enforced in the state from January, 2017. The MVD began a drive to suspend licences of drivers for violations such as red light jumping, speeding, over loading in goods carriages, carrying persons in goods carriages, using mobile phones while driving, driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and driving without helmet and seat belt.
 
 Since then 36,300 cases of speed violations and 2,500 cases of signal violations have been reported in the state. Licenses of 13,026 people were suspended for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and 7,072 people lost their licences for using mobile phones while driving.
 
 As per MVD data for January-March 2018, the highest number of cases were registered for driving two-wheelers without helmets – 11,588. RTO   topped the chart with a total of 1,274 cases. Carrying people in goods carriages seems to be the least committed violation in the state as only 199 cases have been registered so far.
 
 The least number of cases were reported from   at 49, while Thrissur topped the list with 2,879 violations. The capital city witnessed 1,154 traffic violations.
 
 Interestingly, the data also indicates that there is procedural delay in acting against traffic violations. In case of using mobile phones while driving, though 1,584 violations were noticed, the licences of only 1,430 people were suspended. Similarly, 652 cases of overloading were caught while only 209 licences were suspended. Incidentally, recent data shows a decline in the number of accidents. While a total of 38,470 accidents were reported in 2017, the figure was 39,420 in 2016.
 
 “The decline in number of accidents indicate the effectiveness of the stringent measures that we adopted. People are now aware about the directive and more positive results are expected by the year-end,” said  , joint transport commissioner and secretary, state transport authority.
