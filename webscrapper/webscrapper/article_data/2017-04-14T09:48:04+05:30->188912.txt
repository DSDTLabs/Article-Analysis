CHANDIGARH: The Centre’s order to revise   and   rates on a daily basis from May 1 has left local   station owners and consumers confused about the display of fuel rates in sync with international market rates.

 Consumers feel that the decision will trigger a conflict between fuel station owners and buyers over   difference. 
 
 Petroleum minister   Pradhan on Wednesday indicated that state-owned fuel retailers, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and   Corporation Ltd (HPCL), which own more than 95% of nearly the 58,000 fuel stations in the country, will launch a pilot for daily price revision in five cities, including Chandigarh, from May 1 and gradually extend it across the country.
 
 The petrol pump dealers feel that it will not be possible to calculate the rates of petrol on daily basis which depends upon the point of supply of petrol. In Chandigarh, the nearest point of supply is Ambala and the time for change in rate is also not clear. 
 
  of Petrol Pump Dealers Association, Chandigarh, said, “We get petrol from a specific depot in the region. It is called the point of supply and the petrol rates are generated accordingly. Now it is not clear how we will generate the rates on daily basis in sync with international rates. The rates will wary from company to company depending upon the point of supply depot.”
 
 BPCL territory coordinator said, “We have received some instructions from the government explaining how to go about the project but due to holidays we have not been able to read the instructions. Obviously the rates are to be displayed at petrol pumps on a daily basis while displaying international rates. The rate generation will definitely depend upon the point of supply depot of the region. At present it is difficult to say how the project will go by.”
 
 Residents feel that there must be some foolproof system to monitor the change in rates otherwise the customers could get fleeced.
