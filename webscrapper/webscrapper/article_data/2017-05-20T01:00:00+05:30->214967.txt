At a recent event, one of the leading ladies of television   aka Gopi bahu of ' ' lost her cool with the organisers. Dressed in a white gown, looking glamorous,   attended the event with her colleagues and due to some confusion, the boys at the entrance refused to let her enter without passes. The actress who was already under a lot of stress due to her hectic shooting schedules for the past two days, was disappointed that inspite being a popular actress and one of the participants in the show, the guys at the entrance refused to let her in. 

 A source said, "It so happens that these days when TV and   events are filled with a large number of celebs, many times the organisers mess up on invitation passes and other important details. It was completely the organisers' fault to not properly intimate the guys sitting at the entrance and therefore cause this undue embarassment for the actress. If an actress like Devoleena has to go through this, then wonder what will happen to others?"
