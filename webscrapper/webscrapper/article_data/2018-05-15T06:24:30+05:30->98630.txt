BENGALURU: The   (DPI) on Monday extended the deadline for modification of Right to Education ( ) applications to 10am Wednesday, prior to the beginning of the second round of allotment.

 
 This modification process allows parents to change their school preferences and include those schools that may still have empty seats.
 
 Over the weekend,   awaiting allotment of seats under RTE had complained of not receiving the one-time password (OTP), despite having submitted their application number and mobile phone number.
 
 With the earlier deadline ending on 1pm Monday, they were worried about missing out due to technical issues.
 
 Pvt schools demanding money for books, uniforms: Parents
 Parents of RTE students have alleged that they are being charged extra money by private schools, ostensibly for books and uniforms. While the education department has made it clear that schools cannot ask money from RTE students, many parents had to shell out cash, fearing their children’s seats would be revoked.
 
 “My daughter got admission for LKG in a private school in Thanisandra, and I, along with other parents, was asked to pay Rs 4,360. My son, who also got admission under RTE, is in Class 5 and we had to pay Rs 6,640 for his books and uniform. This amount doubled over the past one year — we paid Rs 3,000 last time. There’s a monthly fee of Rs 200-300 too,” said a parent.
 
 “The schools are demanding money mainly because the department hasn’t issued a circular to them making its stand clear. I’ve written to the principal secretary, department of primary and secondary education, highlighting this issue,” said B N Yogananda, general secretary, RTE Students and Parents’ Association.
