 Japan's ambassador to India Kenji Hiramatsu said the northeast, especially Manipur and Nagaland, housed many remnants of World War II.

 Hiramatsu has been a keen advocate of reconciliation between Japan and Great Britain for several decades now and hosted the screening at his official residence on Friday evening. Senior officials of the embassy, as well as representatives of Japanese organizations like   and Japan Information Centre, were in attendance.
 
 Hiramatsu stressed on the efforts to collect the bones of Japanese soldiers from various parts of the region and said it would be an ongoing process aimed at enabling the families of such soldiers to get some closure. He appreciated the unbiased and humanitarian approach of the film, which had its world premiere at the 47th International Film Festival of India, Goa, last year. 
 
 Addressing the gathering, Bhattacharjee said the film was an effort to tell an important historical narrative about a region that was often projected in a negative way in the rest of the country. Borpujari said the film was part of an effort to bring out untold stories from the northeast through cinema.
