THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Opposition leader   and former   president V M   will visit   on Saturday to meet the parents of  , the tribal youth who was lynched by a group of people on Thursday. 

 Chennithala said that the incident was shocking and signals the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
 
  "A group of people killing a youth alleging theft is quiet unheard of and unacceptable to a state like Kerala. It is most unfortunate that such uncivilised culture that was witnessed in the north India is spreading to a most civilised state like  ," he said.
 
 "If the people are taking law into their hands, it is nothing but miserable failure of the law and order situation in the state. The situation is that anyone can kill anybody here. Such incidents were reported only from north India till now," he said.
 
 Sudheeran said that no one in the state should be allowed to take law into their hands and only severe punishment to those who are involved in this incident can give a warning to others. This incident has brought to light the fact that now in Kerala there is no value for a human life and anyone can go to any extreme to kill somebody, which is shameful.
 
 The state government should take all necessary steps to prevent such incidents in the future and also ensure that all the people who are involved in this incident are severely punished, he added.
