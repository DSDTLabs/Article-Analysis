NEW DELHI: The cash-strapped   has brought in a   to   the   for Delhi Metro Rail Corporation ( ) by  .

 A senior official said DMRC only paid a service tax at the rate of 5% of its property tax as “it was categorised as a government establishment. However, as per Section 119 of Delhi Municipal Corporation (DMC) Act, DMRC doesn’t hold the stature of a government establishment”.
 
 According to the proposal, “Under Section 119, only Union properties are exempted. DMRC is a company incorporated in Companies Act and North DMC should consider levy of property tax upon DMRC”. 
 
 DMRC pays Rs 50 lakh annually as service tax, a civic official said, adding that under the proposal, it would have to pay Rs 80 crore every year as property tax. “The north corporation is going through a severe financial crunch and charging property tax will give us a boost.” At least 50 DMRC properties fall under the jurisdicition of the north corporation. 
 
 The standing committee of the corporation approved the proposal on Wednesday and directed the commissioner to withdraw the earlier resolution passed by the civic body on the service charge and raise a fresh demand. Standing committee chairman Tilak Raj Kataria said, “The proposal will now be tabled in the house meeting.” DMRC refused to comment on the matter. 
 
 The demand was originally raised before the trifurcation but DMRC had moved the high court against it. However, the official said, an agreement was signed after the lieutenant governor held a meeting in 2011, which categorised DMRC under government establishment and the decision to charge service tax was approved.
