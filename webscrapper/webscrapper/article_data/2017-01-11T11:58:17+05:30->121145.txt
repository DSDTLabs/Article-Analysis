 Phadte was an active BJP office bearer prior to joining the Goa civil service. He held many vital posts in the BJP and has been closely associated with the activities of the saffron party, the   by the student wing of the NCP states. The party alleged that he was a counting agent for the BJP candidate for the 2012 assembly elections and for current member of parliament   for the 2014   elections. He was the election manager to one of the BJP candidates, the complaint filed by president of the Nationalist Student Congress, Goa, Ritesh Rawal, stated. 
 
 “Such past political affiliations with no cooling off period will be highly inappropriate on the part of the election commission of India to appoint Phadte in any form/format for these current state assembly elections as his involvement will seriously compromise and hamper the impartiality and sanctity of the election process. In view of better elections and to win the confidence of the voters, we earnestly request your office to discontinue Phadte from all responsibilities related to the Goa state assembly elections 2017,” the complaint states.
