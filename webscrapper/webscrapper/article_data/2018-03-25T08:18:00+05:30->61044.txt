PATNA: The 19 faculty members of All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) are expected to send their reply to the Union ministry of health and family welfare within a fortnight to the show-cause notice served to them for alleged irregularities in their appointment as reported by Vikash   inquiry committee set up by the ministry.

 The   report submitted in 2014 found irregularities in the documents submitted by the 19 doctors at the time of their appointment. It had found anomalies in the required academic qualification and teaching experience, on the basis of which the appointments had been made. 
 
 Each individual will submit a personal reply to their respective show-cause notices, AIIMS-P director Dr Prabhat Kumar Singh said on Saturday and added people shouldn’t jump to conclusions in a hurry.
 
 Sources said the hospital administration served show-cause notices to the doctors four years after the submission of Arya committee report and, that too, after the Union ministry wrote to the hospital administration in this regard in February.
 
 A hospital official said though most of the 19 doctors had MBBS and MD degrees, they lacked the minimum three years’ experience at the time of their appointment.
 
 Sources said AIIMS-P always found it difficult to get qualified doctors. It has 305 posts of faculty members, of which at least 185 are vacant.
