Surat: Kiran Gustafsson (33), a Swedish national, is again in the city looking for her mother who had left her at ‘Nari Sanrakshan Gruh’ on Ghod Dod Road many years ago. This is the third attempt by the Swedish career counsellor to locate her parents in the Diamond City.  Gustafsson, who was adopted by a Swedish couple 30 years ago, arrived in the city on Monday with her friend Hannah and advocate Anjali Pawar. She had tried to trace her mother in 2000 and 2005 too, but without success. “I am hopeful that this time I will be able to find my biological mother who must be missing me as much as I am missing her from heart and soul,” said Gustafsson. She will stay in the city for five days.  The trio approached Nari Sanrakshan Gruh on Monday to find out records relating to Gustafsson, where she was left there when she was one-year-and-11-month old by her mother, who was a labourer working on some project on Ghod Dod Road.  “Gustafsson’s mother must have found it difficult to take proper care of her and left her at the shelter home. She had visited Gustafsson many times after leaving her at Nari Sanrakshan Gruh. We are trying to trace her mother by contacting some authorities. We are hopeful of being successful,” said Pawar, a Pune- based lawyer, who works against child trafficking.  Gustafsson went into adoption when she turned three. Swedish couple Kiell-ake, a businessman and photographer, and Maria, a schoolteacher, adopted her from Nari Sanrakshan Gruh after completing all legal formalities. They later informed Gustafsson about her past.  “My life changed completely after my adoption by Swedish parents. I got a better life and support. However, I feel that my mother must be waiting to meet me. I will keep on trying until I find her,” Gustafsson said.
