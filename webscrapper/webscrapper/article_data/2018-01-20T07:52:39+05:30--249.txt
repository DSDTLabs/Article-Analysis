JAIPUR: Six teams of anti-corruption bureau ( ) on Friday conducted raids at office, quarters and houses of an RAS officer posted as sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) in Behror in connection with an FIR of misuse of office lodged against him in 2013.

 However, following the raids, sleuths filed a separate case of disproportionate income against the officer,  , after they seized various things, including cash of nearly Rs 1.5 lakh from the government quarter of the officer.
 
 ACB inspector general   said that in the year 2013 some residents of Dr   had complained that the then tehsildar of   (JDA) Suresh Yadav, who is posted as SDM, Behror, had encroached on a major chunk of 20 beeghas of land that belongs to JDA.
 
 “While we were investigating the case, we got information that the accused officer, Yadav, also had ‘benami property’. So, we got a search warrant from the court and six teams raided several places, including the officer’s government quarter in Behor, his house in Dr Rajendra Prasad Nagar, house of his brother in the same locality,” said Singh while talking to TOI.
 
 Singh added that ACB managed to recover nearly Rs 1.5 lakh in cash from the government quarter of the officer, two registration papers of different plots in Tijaara in Alwar, bank locker details and some documents.
 
 Sleuths further stated that they have various evidence to lodge a separate case of disproportionate income against the officer. “The house of the SDM, Behor, costs nearly Rs 5 crore.
