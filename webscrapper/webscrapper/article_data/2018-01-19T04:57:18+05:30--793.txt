MUMBAI: The   government signed a memorandum of understanding ( ) with the Israel government for its Marathwada   grid   on Thursday.

 The project aims to tackle problems of drinking water and water management in drought-prone   region. 
 
 Under the project, the state government has decided to interlink all major dams in Marathwada for effective use of water. The dams include Jayakwadi, Ujjani, Terna, Vishnupuri, Manjara and Siddheshwar. 
 
 The Devendra Fadnavis-led government had announced plans to link the dams during a special cabinet session on Marathwada in November 2016. 
 
 “I think with their experience and technology, we will be able to create one of the biggest and best water grids in Maharashtra,” said Fadnavis.
 
 The chief minister also welcomed Israel’s help for the distressed agricultural sector. “Technologies which you (Israel) offer will surely double the income of our farmers,” Fadnavis said at the India-Israel Business Summit in the city, which was attended by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 
 Fadnavis said initiatives such as the centre of excellence and “joining the dots” in the backward area of the state, which prides itself as being the most progressive in the country, will “change the face of agriculture in India and Maharashtra”.
 
 Fadnavis also referred to terrorism, terming the 26/11 tragedy as an attack on humanity and not on sovereignity alone, and said that the fight against terror would be intensified further.
