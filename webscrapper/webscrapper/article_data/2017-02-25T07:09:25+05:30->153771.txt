MUMBAI: The BJP led by chief minister Devendra   has emerged as a largest party in the municipal councils, municipal corporations, zilla parishads and panchayat samitis elections across the state held between December 2016 and February 2017.

 Under the data compiled by the state government, out of 171 posts of presidents of municipal councils, BJP won 71, followed by Congress (35),   (26), NCP (21), Independents (15), local parties (18) and others (5).Out of the 4,706 seats in 210 municipal councils, BJP won 1,192 seats, Congress (952), NCP (812) and Shiv Sena (612).
 
 Out of the 10 municipal corporations, BJP secured a clear majority in eight. In the crucial BMC polls, BJP secured 82 seats against 32 it had won in 2012 elections. In 10 municipal corporations, the BJP secured 629 seats, followed by Shiv Sena (268), NCP (139) (265), Congress (119), MNS (14), others (94).
 
 In the zilla parishad elections for 1,452 seats, the BJP secured 400 seats, followed by NCP (346), Shiv Sena (264), Congress (239), MNS (17), others (152). In the panchayat samiti elections out of 2,809 seats, BJP won 803 seats, NCP (630), Congress (555) and Shiv Sena (538).
 
 A senior BJP cabinet member told TOI that from the outcome of the elections it has been established that the era of CongressNCP is over. “Barring three zilla parishads, the Congress-NCP combine failed to secure a clear majority in any zilla parishad. In the case of municipal corporations, councils and panchayat samitis too, the performance of the Congress and NCP was dismal. We dismissed NCP from the   municipal corporation controlled by Ajit Pawar. In Nanded, the home town of state Congress chief  , the Congress failed to secure a clear majority,“ he said.
 
 He said the massive mandate for the BJP indicates that the people of Maharashtra had accepted policies of Prime Minister   and Fadnavis.
 
 A former Congress MP said Fadnavis single-handedly campaigned across the state for the urban and local bodies.
