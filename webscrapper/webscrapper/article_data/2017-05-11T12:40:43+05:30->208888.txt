CUTTACK: Two days after blowing away   4-0,  's defending champions subdued   3-2 at   on Wednesday evening to virtually seal a semifinal berth in the Federation Cup.

 With two wins in as many games,   lead Group B with six points. However, with DSK Shivajians (3 points) stunning Bengaluru FC (3 points) in the day's first match, Mohun Bagan will have to wait until Friday to confirm their place in the knockout.
 
 If Shivajians beat Lajong -who crashed out with back-to-back defeats -and Mohun Bagan lose to Bengaluru in the final-round group league fixtures, three teams (Bagan, BFC and Shivajians) will finish with six points each. Bagan, though, are frontrunners with a plus-5 goal difference.
 
 If it was a   show two days ago, Wednesday's win was spiced up by foreign flavour. Darryl Duffy (5th minute), Sony Norde (21) and Katsumi Yusa (43) were all on target, handing Mohun Bagan a 3-1 lead and killing the game as a contest in the first half itself after they had suffered a second-minute setback through Pritam Kotal's own goal.
