CHENNAI: Health condition of M   – husband of jailed   leader V K   -- who has been admitted to Gleneagles Global Health City at Perumbakkam in Chennai has worsened. 

 Natarajan has been undergoing treatment in the hospital for the past nine months for liver failure.
  
 A bulletin issued by Institute of Liver Diseases and Transplantation director Dr K Illankumaran on Monday said the 74-year-old had been advised a combined kidney and liver transplant. 
 
 “Currently he is admitted to the liver intensive care unit with worsening liver failure, kidney failure and lung congestion. His condition remains critical,” it said. 
 
 It said while he was receiving dialysis and liver failure, he was not on ventilator support and was awaiting the organs for a transplant.
  
 On February 5, he was brought to Apollo Hospitals on the Greams Road after reportedly complaining of breathing problems. He then moved to Global Hospital and has been under the care of liver transplant surgeon Dr Mohamed Rela.
 
 On September 10, the hospital said Natarajan had registered with the   Organ Sharing Registry for deceased donor liver transplant.
  
 According to hospital sources, Natarajan’s condition has worsened in the past two weeks. The hospital has been giving him a slow, low, efficient, daily dialysis (SLEDD) -- a form of therapy done in the intensive care unit on a regular basis to remove excess fluid from the body. 
 
 “He will need a dual transplant before his lung function deteriorates further,” a senior doctor said.
