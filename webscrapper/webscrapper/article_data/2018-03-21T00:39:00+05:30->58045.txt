Pune: Many important documents were destroyed in a fire that broke out in the godown of the state government’s printing press, popularly known as Photo Zinco, near the district collector’s office on Tuesday evening. The Pune fire brigade officials extinguished the fire within 20 minutes. “Dry leaves spread on the premises of the press somehow caught fire on Tuesday evening. The flames reached the wooden windows of the godown and engulfed the documents and papers stored there. Dense smoke permeated in the press and the neighbouring areas,” fire brigade officials told TOI. Two fire tenders and a water tanker were rushed to the spot soon after the fire brigade was alerted about the incident. The godown is located between two government buildings, all of which were constructed about 50 to 60 years ago. “Due to this, the fire tenders could not be taken to the godown building,” a fire brigade official said, adding that they had to use long hose pipes to reach the godown. “It took us about 20 minutes to douse the fire completely,” the official said. The government godown has a large number of government documents, stock of papers and other books. “Many of these documents have been destroyed in the evening blaze,” the official said.
