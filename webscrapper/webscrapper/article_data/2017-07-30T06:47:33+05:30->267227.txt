HYDERABAD: A 23-year-old pregnant woman from Warangal, S Bhavani, succumbed to swine flu late on Friday night at the   Bhavani is the second swine flu casualty reported this monsoon season so far (third since January), after the mutation of the H1N1 virus into the Michigan strain from the earlier California strain. The first death was reported from the state-run facility last week

 Official records suggest that a total of 1,513 H1N1 positive cases have been detected so far this year. However, no deaths were recorded during the first few months of the year. 
 
 But while the casualty count has been limited, health authorities said that they registered an 'unusually high' number of cases during the summer months , both in the state as well as other neighbouring states. This, they added, led to suspicion about the mutation of the deadly   While the mutation was confirmed earlier this month by the National Institute of Virology, Pune, which had tested samples, health authorities maintain that there has been no evidence suggesting that the latest strain is more virulent.
 
 Meanwhile, the Michigan strain has been doing the rounds elsewhere in the world since 2015 and has only now been isolated in the country. "While the fact that the virus has mutated has been confirmed but whether it is stronger than the earlier strain or not is not confirmed. Usually when a mutation happens the newer strain emerges stronger than the earlier strain and hence an immediate switch in the vaccine is required," said a senior official from the state health department.
