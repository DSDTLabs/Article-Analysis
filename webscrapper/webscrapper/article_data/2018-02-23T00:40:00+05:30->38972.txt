Coimbatore: With the National Eligibility and Entrance Test (Neet) round the corner, protests have once again surfaced in the district. On Thursday, a group of men staged a protest demanding exemption from Neet for Tamil Nadu in the city. The men, numbering around 100, from the Federation for Protection of Social Justice, gathered in front of the South Taluk Office in the morning. The federation had members from various political outfits including DMK. They demanded that Tamil Nadu be exempted from Neet permanently. “This year, the poor and rural students of Tamil Nadu would be put to hardship like the last year. We don’t want another student like Anitha to die. The centre should exempt Tamil Nadu from Neet and save the students form the trouble,’’ said a protester from Dravidar Kazhagam, one of the outfits in the federation. The agitators also sought the President’s assent to the bills passed by the state assembly that sought permanent exemption from Neet for Tamil NAdu. The federation members said they would intensify the protests if the exemption was not granted immediately. TNN
