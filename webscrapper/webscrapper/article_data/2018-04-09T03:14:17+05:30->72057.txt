NAVI MUMBAI: Garbage collected by   conservancy workers from footpaths, gardens and roadsides is being dumped daily along the   tree belt between   tennis court parking lot and   ground. 

 Residents allege that with the Swachh survey central team leaving the city, the civic workers have stopped clearing garbage which gets accumulated inside the tree belt, turning the green cover into a waste dumping yard.
 
 Civic sources said due to lack of enough garbage compactors daily clearing has become difficult. However, the residents are in no mood to buy the civic officials' theory and blame the civic administration for doing little to keep the city clean even after the survey.
 
 The waste that should go to the designated dumping ground at   landfill is instead finding its way to the tree belt right under the nose of civic officials, say residents. The Vashi tree belt stretches for over 500m. "This dumping activity goes on unchecked and the agencies responsible for safeguarding the green belt should come forth to remove the trash on a daily basis," said a resident, Shivan Tiwari. 
 
 Vashi ward officer and assistant civic commissioner   said, "Officials from solid waste and garden departments have been flagged off. As far as I am aware, the trash has been accumulated from the green belt itself and not from roads and footpaths. Due to shortage of garbage lifters, we have demarcated particular sectors to be cleaned on alternate days."
