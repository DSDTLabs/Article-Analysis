NEW DELHI: A protest flyer calling for large numbers to gather at   against the   government for the recent communal violence in the state kicked up a controversy on Twitter for a picture that allegedly relates to the 2002   riots. 

 Posted by BJP spokesperson  , the flyer carried a picture of a burning vehicle. Several comments on the social network immediately pointed out that the image was actually from the 2002 Gujarat riots, linking to news reports in international outlets that had used the same.
 
 Sharma tweeted the flyer from her verified handle @NupurSharmaBJP late on Friday night. It read, "Bengal, once the land of peace and glory, is today falling on all fronts... join us to protest the lawlessness and falling value of human life." The picture of a vehicle set ablaze occupied prominent space in the flyer. It was identified as a picture from news agency Associated Press clicked on February 28, 2002 in Ahmedabad.
 
 Even as several questioned the appropriateness of the image, Sharma said she only tweeted it as someone had forwarded it to her. "I was forwarded the flyer from the organisers, and I tweeted it. I didn't know where it came from. What is important here is that human life is human life and this killing needs to be controlled. Law and order is a state subject and   needs to be pulled up for it in Bengal," Sharma told TOI over phone, pointing out that she had shared other calls to action for protests against the Bengal violence from her account as well. 
 
 By afternoon, there were several responses to Sharma's tweet, with some questioning the wisdom of using a picture of the Gujarat riots, which the opposition has consistently used to target Modi.
