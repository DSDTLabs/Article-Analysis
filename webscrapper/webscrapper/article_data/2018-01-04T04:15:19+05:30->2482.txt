RANCHI: A special   court on Wednesday deferred announcement of the quantum of punishment for   chief   by two days, saying it would carry out such pronouncements in alphabetical order. Alphabetically, the former   CM’s name is sixth on the list of 16 convicts to be sentenced along with him in the fodder scam case. 

 Lalu and the other convicts were brought to the court at 10.30am. The special CBI court of Shiv Pal Singh decided to hear the arguments on the quantum of punishment in the second half of the session. The death of an advocate,  , also led to changes in the schedule of the court’s proceedings. 
 
 An association of advocates abstained from work as a mark of respect for their departed colleague. The court, nevertheless, served contempt notices on Lalu’s son and the leader of the opposition in Bihar assembly,  , Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari, RJD vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, and RJD official Shivanand Tiwari. It asked them to explain by January 23 why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against them for attributing motives to its verdict. 
 
 In response to the notice, Singh said he never commented on the verdict. He added, “There’s no such record. I had commented on   and the NDA in relation to the bail given to Jagannath Mishra (former Bihar CM), which Lalu Prasad wasn’t granted.” Tewari said people often speak on court orders. Tejashwi was not available for comment. 
 
 He had earlier said if Lalu could be held guilty in the fodder scam why should Nitish Kumar be spared in the Srijan case. Prabhat Kumar, Lalu’s counsel, said the court also pulled up the CBI for including names of some accused in the list of approvers. Lalu has been convicted in another fodder scam case and is out on bail granted by the Supreme Court.
