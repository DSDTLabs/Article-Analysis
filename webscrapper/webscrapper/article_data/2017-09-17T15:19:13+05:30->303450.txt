Veteran playback singer   has expressed his wish for offering prayers at Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple here on   day, which falls on September 30.
 
 According to sources, the singer who has time and again made abortive appeals for permission to enter lord Krishnaâ€™s Guruvayur temple has presented his request to the Padmanabha Swamy temple chief executive officer, via a special messenger.
  
 Though he was never given permission by the Guruvayur devaswom authorities to enter the famous Krishna temple for being a non-Hindu, he had offered prayers to Sabarimala Ayyappa temple and is a regular pilgrim to   temple.
  
 According to sources, the Padmanabha Swamy temple executive committee would discuss the request of Yesudas at a meeting scheduled on Monday. The opinion of temple head priest would be also sought before taking a final decision on Yesudas' request. However, unlike Guruvayur temple, most other temples, including Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple seldom deny permission to non-Hindus for entering the temple, provided they seek permission in advance and solemnly affirm that they believe in Hindu religious practices and the temple.
 
 In the case of Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple, which is considered as the richest temple in the world, permission is often given to even foreigners to enter the temple. The temple chief executive officer often exercises his discretionary powers to give permission to non-Hindus to offer prayers at the temple.
