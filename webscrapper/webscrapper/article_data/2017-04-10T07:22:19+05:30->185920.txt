PUNE: Mini Mathur, a Kondhwa resident who travels to Kothrud via   on a regular basis, sees motorists unabashedly travelling on the wrong side of the road between   and the junction. 

 From tempos, two-wheelers and cars, the steady stream of traffic violates road rules only to avoid the junction and cut across a lane to reach Kondhwa Road. Mathur has personally reported the matter to the local traffic police after which some constables were posted at the turn. However, it remains a temporary solution as police officers deployed at the busy Lullanagar junction, where traffic-related chaos is peaking due to the flyover construction, have to be stationed there.
 
 B Kumar, who works with a private firm at Undri, explained that the distance from the road used to cut across to the junction is just about 150 metres. "They drive on the wrong side of the road to avoid the signal. There is no signboard or any traffic police officer at the turn to deter the vehicles," stated Kumar.
 
 When questioned by TOI, a traffic police officer at the Lullanagar Chowk explained that it would be difficult to deploy men at both spots. "We had tried it earlier but with the junction itself facing lot of traffic congestion when signals do not function properly, the traffic police cannot be stationed there. However, a placing a board warning against wrong-side driving can be considered," he said. 
 
 Kondhwa traffic officials added that they have carried out drives to reign in violators at the junction but eventually blamed motorists for the situation. "As a citizen, one has to follow traffic rules. Why should traffic police officers be deployed at every spot to keep a check? Motorists should take the trouble to wait at the signal for three minutes," an officer said.
 
 Another local resident highlighted the fact that a similar problem is evident in Gangadham area, where people choose to drive on the wrong side of the road up to Indian Oil Petrol pump.
