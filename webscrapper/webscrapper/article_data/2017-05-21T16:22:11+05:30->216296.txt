 himself! But with   there is a slight deviation. The director is going around town, claiming that  , who isn't charging a single paisa, has a cameo in the film. Strangely, Jisshu's shooting schedule stretches for eight long days! A little bird tells me that   actually had a payment dispute with the producer and the dignified actor that he is, he decided to do the film for free for friend Srijit. Who else has a cameo in it? The yeti of course! He's also not getting paid!
