CHANDIGARH: The   police on Thursday arrested two alleged “highly-radicalised men,” working under instructions of foreign-based   handlers to carry out targeted killings in the state.

 The men — Sandeep Singh (26), of Bangi Nihal village in Talwandi Sabo and   (48), of Chattha village under Sadar-Dabwali police station of Haryana’s   district — were arrested from the   highway and two pistols of .30 bore and 40 live rounds of ammunition were seized from them.
 
 The two men were allegedly linked to terror modules involved in the Punjab targeted killings, the police claimed and added that the two accused were in touch with Australia-based Gurjant Singh. Gurjant was charged by the National Investigation Agency for RSS leader Ravinder Gosain’s murder in Ludhiana last year.
 
 The two men were arrested after their motorcycle collided with a Mahindra Scorpio on Faridkot-Kotkapura national highway.
 
 The two accused disclosed they had been in touch with their handlers through social media and encrypted Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls, the police claimed, adding that the duo had been tasked with carrying out killings of people by their handlers.
 
 Cops probe accused's terror links
 
 The Punjab police are investigating the links of the two accused with other possible terror module members and Khalistani operatives. The Punjab police had busted a terror module on May 29 last year and had found its members had formed a sub-group, called “Khalistan Zindabad,” that was linked to the radical website of International Sikh Federation, founded by Gurjant.
 
 Gurjant has been accused of involvement in financing Khalistan Liberation Force and   terrorist modules involved in carrying out eight targeted killings in Punjab between January 2016 and October 2017.
 
 The police registered an FIR on Thursday against the duo at Kotkapura city police station under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and under various sections of the Arms Act.
