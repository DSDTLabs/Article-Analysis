PUNE: World No. 6   rang the warning bells for his rivals as he played sublime tennis to brush aside talented Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert in straight sets and storm into the semifinals of the $560,000   here on Thursday.

 Beginning the proceedings with an ace, Cilic needed just an hour and four minutes to vanquish an inexplicably off-colour Herbert, world ranked 81, 6-3, 6-2 in their quarterfinal clash.
 
 "It's the first time we are facing but I know him already for a coupleof years from theTour. We have played against each other in doubles a couple of times," Cilic said. "I paid attention to couple of details from the previous match (of Herbert). A couple of good things and a couple of not so best things. But I tried to keep my focus and I served very good, which gave me a few free points. And I also hit freely (from the baseline)."
 
 Cilic will next take on Frenchman   who ended the run of qualifier Ricardo Ojeda Lara of Spain 6-2, 6-3. The 26-year-old Frenchman, who had blasted aces at will against   on Wednesday, committed as many as five double-faults compated to Cilic's seven aces.
 
 Kevin survives Mikhail threat
 
 South African giant   blasted 24 aces, including a 224kmph one, to edge out Kazakhstan's   6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-2 in the quarterfinals. Anderson, the 2017 US Open finalist and world No. 14, broke seventh seed Kukushkin in the eighth game but the latter hit back immediately to level it at 5-5 and push the opening set into tiebreak. The 74th ranked Russia-born Kukushkin won the shootout comfortably.
 
 Anderson will face fourth seed and wildcard Benoit Paire, the Frenchman coming through 7-5, 2-6, 6-3 against Robin Haase, the fifth seed from The Netherlands.
