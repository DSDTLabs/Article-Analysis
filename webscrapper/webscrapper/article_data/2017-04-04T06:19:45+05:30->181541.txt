Mumbai:   who use BMC-run pay-and-park   in south Mumbai say they are “used to being looted” by attendants and therefore are unpertubed by the steep hike in charges. They are now being charged Rs 60 an hour for  , up from Rs 15 to Rs 20 earlier.

 When TOI visited a parking lot at Crawford   on Monday, the majority of motorists said they have been overcharged in the past. 
 
 Khar’s Nelson Bugri said, “Four-wheeler owners have always been robbed by parking lot attendants. We were being illegally charged Rs 100 to Rs 200, much higher than even the new official rate of Rs 60.”
 
 Some said they have had to often “negotiate” with the attendants to bring down charges. 
 
 Masid Bunder’s Shabaz Inamdar said, “After negotiating with the attendants, who would quote any charge they felt like, we would bring down the rate to Rs 80 or Rs 100. The increase in official parking charges therefore sounds ridiculous.” The attendants would rarely give them receipts.
 
 Oshiwara’s Waist Patel said, “They should not have hiked the rates. We fear the attendants will illegally hike their charges too.”
