CHENNAI: Making a legal distinction between cases of people going 'missing', and those involving people detained under illegal custody, the Madras high court has said habeas corpus petitions could be filed only if there is a strong suspicion of illegal detention. 

 "It is a condition precedent that a person filing a habeas corpus petition should establish that there is a prima facie case of illegal detention or at least a suspicion in respect of such illegal detention. In the absence of any of these ingredients, no habeas corpus petition can be entertained under Article 226 of the Constitution," said a division bench of   S Ramathilagam.
 
 
 
 
 A person voluntarily moving out of home cannot be treated to be in illegal custody and habeas corpus petitions cannot be filed, the bench said. "When there is no suspicion of illegal detention, cases are to be dealt as regular cases by the competent court of law," it said. 
 
 Pointing out that many police personnel are spending or wasting a lot of time traveling across the country to pursue man/woman missing cases, the judges said: "It causes lots of concern and expenditure to the exchequer. This apart, efforts made without any basis cause a concern for prosecution and to investigating authorities. Thus, the police must be used potentially to trace out cases of genuine allegation of illegal detention, and in the event of such a relief being sought by the petitioners in habeas corpus petitions."
 
 Making it clear that the scope of habeas corpus petitions is limited, the bench said the extraordinary jurisdiction of courts co uld not be invoked for cases with no 'strong suspicion' of illegal detention. 
 
 The court passed the order dismissing a habeas corpus plea by Kalaiarasi, seeking to trace her husband by filing complaint six years after he left the house.
