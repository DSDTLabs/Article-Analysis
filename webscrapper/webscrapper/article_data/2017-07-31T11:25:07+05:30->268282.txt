On Saturday, ' ' actors   and   were up for mischief and decided to gatecrash an engagement ceremony at a suburban hotel. "We had warned the event managers but the moment we walked in, I could hear people saying, ‘Inko bhi bulaya hai kya?’. And the expression on the new couple’s faces was priceless!" laughs Ayushmann.

  
  
 
 Eventually he got the couple to dance to the tunes of 'Sweety Tera Drama', from the actor’s upcoming rom-com, not once but twice. "It’s a fun, desi track and as soon as they played it, the crowd went berserk!" adds Ayushmann, admitting that as a kid he had gatecrashed weddings earlier with a bunch of 10 friends.
 
  "After a game of cricket, we’d get ready and gatecrash a party for a late-night icecream. It was easier earlier when nobody knew me, but I haven’t done it after becoming an actor. It’s great fun, I’m a huge fan of the band   who gatecrashed weddings for one of their songs. I would like to do that with my band too."
 
 Kriti admits that she was a bit nervous, having never done anything like this before even with the ‘expert’ Ayushmann by her side.
 
  "I’m sure he must have done it on the sly before but this time we were actually announcing it. Once we got in, I was having so much fun I didn’t want it to end. In the film, no sangeet in Bareilly happens without Bitti and I announced at this gathering that now that she had come to Mumbai, she had to be a part of this engagement party too," says Kriti who even got the mothers of the bride and the groom-tobe to fall in step with her and even taught them a few new moves.
 
 To her surprise there was a teenage girl there who knew all the steps from the song. And after this fun evening, the duo want to gatecrash a few more parties.
