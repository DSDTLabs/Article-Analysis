THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Minister for   and backward classes   has said that the government will bring in required legislation to ensure   and strict compliance with rules and regulations while   allocated for the welfare of SC/ST and backward classes.

 The minister’s announcement came after a query by opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala in the assembly on Thursday whether the government will conduct an assessment study on ‘why these marginalized sections remain socially and economically backward in spite of various schemes and government funding’.
 
 “The government welcomes this constructive suggestion. What we require is a comprehensive project for their welfare. We are thinking of a legislation which can regulate spending and utilisation, and compliance with rules to ensure that the funds are reaching the beneficiaries,” the minister said.
 
 On the allegations of infant deaths in tribal areas due to malnutrition, the minister said the deaths were not due to lack of nutritious food. The infant death rate in tribal areas are now less than that of the state average, he said.
 
 Elaborating on the department’s new initiatives, Balan said separate hostels for boys and girls from scheduled castes will be set up in six corporations this year itself. 
 
 “Internet facility will be provided in all postmetric hostels, while three new hostels for women from the community will be set up in Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode,” he said.
