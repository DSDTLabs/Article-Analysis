MELBOURNE: During a changeover in the second set during their mixed doubles quarterfinals against the Aussie pairing of   and Sam Groth, Paes lied stomach down and asked his partner to press the middle of his spine. Paes had just suffered a small niggle after having a roll over during play. With the nimble presses of the Swiss Miss not quite doing the job, Paes asked Hingis to stand on her back. That failed to work as well and the Indian maestro finally had to call the doctor during the following break.

 “I felt I needed an adjustment. My back got a little whack and it needed a click. Except that she's so light. She's gotten so light and trim, it couldn't click,” Paes made light of the moment.
 
 There was nothing to smile about at all though after being outplayed 6-3, 6-2 by the home pair on the Margaret Court Arena.
 
 “They both served very well. They didn't miss. We didn't have one chance. His (Groth's) second serve was coming down at 190 kmph, or 180. For a girl, that's pretty strong,” Hingis heaped praise on their opponents.
 
 “They played a perfect match. They had seven challenges, six of them right. Today what they did was magic. That's what normally we do to other side,” Paes chimed in.
 
 Hingis said her lack of match practice was compounded by the two-day gap they had after their second round. “He (Groth) played a lot of matches. For me it was the fourth match in two weeks. He played last night, he played the day before. We had two days off and today even before I got into the match it was already over,” she said.
