LUCKNOW: The tragic accident involving a school van on Thursday exposed the utter negligence of the transport department and caught the officials napping. After the tragic accident in which 13 schoolchildren died, it was detected that the ill-fated school van had been plying for the last four years without registration and the department officials were not aware of it. 

 Principal secretary )transport)  , said, "Prima facie it appears so because we have not been able to track its registration number." The department will take action against the dealer who sold the vehicle unregistered. The vehicle was not a private one but was owned by the school. The vehicle had been purchased from a showroom at Nausar, Gorakhpur in September 2014.
 
 The dealer had sold it 'unregistered' despite dealer point registration system existing in the state under which a dealer can not sell a vehicle without registration. The school never got the van registered in  . To operate a vehicle as school transportation, a school permit is required for which a fixed amount of fee is charged. Worse, the transport department could not even catch the wrong-doing till the school van was hit by the train and 13 schoolchildren died.
 
 If the school van was plying with a fake registration number or a temporary registration number is a matter of enquiry. The dealer who sold the vehicle would be questioned and his trade certificate would be cancelled. 
 
 The department has ordered a 15-day drive against school vehicles in the state from Friday.
