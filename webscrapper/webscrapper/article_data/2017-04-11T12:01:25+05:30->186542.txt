PANAJI: The   retaliated against   national president Amit Shah’s jibes saying that the BJP’s April 9 felicitation programme at Campal had failed to lift the flagging morale of the BJP cadre. Addressing a press conference on Monday, Congress called the present Manohar Parrikar-led state government “the most opportunistic alliance in the history of Goa’s politics.”

 “Our prayer before the BJP is to tell us what the felicitation was for? If it was a celebration, what was being celebrated? The BJP has defeated Goan voters and the mandate, is that what was being celebrated?”   secretary and spokesperson Girish Chodankar said.
 
 Taking a further jibe at the BJP, the Congress said that the BJP cadre was demoralized as it felt defeated twice in the span of four days. “The BJP karyakarta morale is down. They think they lost twice, on the day of the counting and at the swearing in of Parrikar, they lost again,” Chodankar said.
 
 On March 11, the Congress emerged as the single largest party, but it was the BJP, with the support of independent MLAs,   and MGP that formed the government. The BJP organized a felicitation programme in the capital and had expected nearly 15,000 people to attend, but core party workers stayed away from the function, which was relatively muted.
 
 “This is an unholy alliance. Political entities with opposing views have come together. The common minimum programme of this alliance government is not out. What thread holds this government together?” Goa Congress spokesperson   said.
 
 Naik went on to ask the BJP alliance government its stand on the IPB, reservation of 80% jobs in the private sector for Goans, MoI, nationalization of rivers, and casinos.
 
 “They have felicitated themselves, but their speeches were nothing but empty political talk. It is an insult to the people and the mandate,” Naik added.
