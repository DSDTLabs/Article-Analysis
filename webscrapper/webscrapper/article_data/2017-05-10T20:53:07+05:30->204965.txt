 In accordance with this, the Madhya Pradesh bio-diversity rules 2004, also have provision in rule 22 (1) that the areas of importance from bio-diversity point of view should be notified with consultation with the Union government and local bodies. 
 
 The rule number 22 (2) of the same rules also have provision for formation of guidelines for identification and management of these bio-diversity heritage site. 
 
 But the rules were not formulated till date; recently the rules have been identified and published. 
 
 “We have written to the concerned departments. If things go well, Patalkot in   district and   in Anuppur district will be notified within next two months,” member secretary of the  , R  . 
 
 “As per the Act, once the areas are notified and the local bio-diversity committees are functional then the focus will be on sustainable use of bio resources. Measures will be taken for conservation of species and in case the committees feel that use of a specific commodity or mineral can affect the bio-diversity of the area, then it could restrict or limit the use of that particular bio-resource. It will also lead to creating awareness about conservation of the species,” Murthy said.
