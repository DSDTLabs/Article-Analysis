RAJKOT: The state CID (crime) on Tuesday began investigation into the massive   in   area that destroyed nearly 1,000 tonne groundnut purchased at minimum support price (MSP) on Sunday night.

 The CID crime officials recorded statements of eight persons including the   owner Narendra Patel, manager D M Patel, accountant and a private security guard of an adjacent plot. The agency is likely to lodge a complaint in this regard within few days.
 
 On Tuesday, CID crimeâ€™s deputy superintendent of police D P Vaghela, police inspector R G Rana, Rajkot superintendent of police   and Range IG D N Patel visited the warehouse. 
 
 Nearly 28,000 bags (each bag weighing 35kg) worth Rs 5 crore procured from Jamnagar district were gutted in the blaze. This was the fifth incident of fire in groundnut warehouse and it is suspected that some miscreants are deliberately resorting to such foul play in order to cover up the irregularities in procurement. 
 
 There have been complaints of groundnut bags containing pebbles and large quantity of mud being sold at MSP of Rs 900 per 20kg as announced by the state government as a pre-poll sop last year.
