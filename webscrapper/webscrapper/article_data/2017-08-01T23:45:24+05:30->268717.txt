Margao: Raia villagers agreed to resurveying houses in the village at a recent gram sabha.  Raia resident Xavier Fernandes said, “Many houses have been reconstructed and built with slabs but are still paying the old house tax of Rs 30-40.”  “The audit report has passed severe strictures against the Raia panchayat with regards to non-maintenance of streetlights for 2015-16 and raised objections to providing the panchayat premises for free to the local MLA, Raia Sporting Club and a fair price shop,” said Fernandes. tnn
