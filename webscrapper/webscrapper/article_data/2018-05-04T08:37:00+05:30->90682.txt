KOLKATA: A   was damaged, apparently by a firecracker or a  , in the   on Wednesday evening.

 
 Cops said the fibre bust, installed in a park off Canal East Road more than a decade ago, had cracks on its lower portion. Burn marks were found in the damaged portion. The face, however, was intact.
 
 The Narkeldanga police has started an inquiry into the incident. The partially damaged statue has been temporarily covered with a piece of cloth.
 
 “It appears that someone threw a firecracker or a lowintensity crude bomb.Some youths had come to this area on Wednesday. We are trying to identify them,” said a police officer. A picket has been posted in the area.
 
 After locals and political parties protested, the civic body said they were trying to get the bust repaired at the earliest. “We have lodged a complaint at the police station and given them a day’s time to find out who are behind the incident,” said Sudipto Banerjee, general secretary of Forward Bloc’s youth wing. “If no action is taken, we will stage demonstrations outside the police station,” he added.
 
 Chandra Bose, grand nephew of Subhas Chandra Bose and BJP’s state unit vice-president, demanded the strictest possible action.
 
 “Some passerby had noticed the damaged statue on Wednesday morning and soon its photographs started circulating,” said a local resident.
