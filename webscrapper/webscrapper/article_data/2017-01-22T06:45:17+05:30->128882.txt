HYDERABAD: Incomplete addresses and missing contact numbers of swine flu patients has made it an uphill task for health officials entrusted with the job of tracking the cases.

 Since the swine flu outbreak, sources said inaccurate names on the list of swine flu patients furnished daily by the   ( ) are leading to confusion.
 
 For instance, the IPM detected eight out of 43 swab samples it tested on Friday to be   positive. But addresses and contact numbers of three patients undergoing treatment in two corporate hospitals in   were missing.“Without complete details, how can we reach out to the patient's relatives to check whether they need to be given prophylactic antiviral Tamiflu drugs or not. Surveillance of the disease cannot be done in such cases,“ said a city health official, on condition of anonymity . The health official told TOI that confusion over the details is also leading to wastage of precious time.
 
 In the three positive cases furnished by IPM, while two patients had only their hospital address noted in the record, the other one had just the patient's name. “The IPM should never accept swab samples from corporate hospitals without address and contact numbers. This is the only way to solve this problem,“ the official added.
 
 When contacted, Dr C Sivaleela, in-charge IPM, said they are accepting only those swab samples from corporate hospitals that have complete addresses and contact numbers. “We are not at fault. However, a few corporate hospitals are known to be furnishing only in-patient (IP) number along with the swab sample,“ she said.
 
 Meanwhile, the number of swine flu patients testing positive has shot up to 70 since January 1, according to a statement released by Telangana health minister Dr C Laxma Reddy on Saturday . “There is no need to panic. There have been few deaths due to delay in in diagnosis and hospitalisation,“ the minister said.
