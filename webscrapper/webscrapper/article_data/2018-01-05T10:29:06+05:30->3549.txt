TIRUPUR: A Class XII girl student was killed when she was ran over by a private bus after she fell off a moped near   here on Thursday.

 The girl,  , 17, was the daughter of Manokaran-Selvi couple from Koneripatti. She was studying in a government-aided school at Dharapuram. According to police, every day she used to walk 2km from her home to   junction on Dharapuram-Oddanchatram Road to take bus to the school.
 
 On Thursday, a neighbour boy, who studies in a private school, earlier offered to drop Dharani and her friend at Koneripatti junction. As they missed the usual bus, the girls asked him to drop them in the next bus stop so that they could catch the missed bus, the police said.
 
 The boy managed to overtake the bus in his moped. But Dharani who was sitting at the edge slipped from the moped. The private bus ran over her. She died on the spot. Other two students suffered minor injuries.
 
 The police took the body to the Dharapuram Government Hospital for postmortem. Later, the body was handed over to Dharaniâ€™s parents. The police have registered a case.
