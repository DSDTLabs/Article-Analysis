New Delhi: Members of a panel of the Public Accounts Committee ( ) on Thursday raised questions about the 80:20 gold import scheme which was launched under the watch of the then finance minister P  , alleging that it was exploited by fugitive jewellers   and   to launder money. 

 The sub-committee of the PAC on direct and indirect taxes, headed by   MP  , asked the top officials of the revenue department to share all file comments and examine the links of the 80:20 plan with the   fraud. Sources said the members raised questions about the role of former finance minister Chidambaram and pointed to a CAG report of 2016 which had showed how the scheme had caused revenue loss to the exchequer of around Rs 1.3 lakh crore. 
 
 The sources said some members pointed out that the CAG report had also indicated at the possibility of the scheme being misused for round-tripping of black money. 
 
 They also raised questions about the role of Chidambaram. The finance secretary, chairman of the central board of direct taxes and chairman of the central board of excise and customs and senior officials of the Enforcement directorate appeared before the panel. 
 
 The 80:20 scheme was launched in August 2013. Bowing to pressure from jewellers, the previous UPA government had eased some of the curbs and private agencies were allowed to import gold under the scheme that mandated traders to export 20% of all gold imported while retaining 80% for domestic use. The measures were put in place at a time when the government was trying to curb gold imports to tame the current account deficit. 
 
 In November 2014, the NDA government removed restrictions on gold imports, scrapping the controversial 80:20 scheme amid allegations of misuse by half a dozen companies. Curiously, the UPA government decided to lift several restrictions on gold imports on May 16, the day results of the general elections were declared.
