VADODARA: At a time when youth in the country are taking up  , two young   (MP) are working to create  .

  and   from Indore are in city to take part in 6th Solar Cookers International World Conference that kicked off on Monday at Muni Seva Ashram at Goraj. 
 
 Kasliwal, a chartered accountancy student, is into farming since last six years. “When I was 20 years old, I started with organic farming on one acre land but for the past three years I am doing natural farming,” said Kasliwal, who is also a graduate in taxation and an accounting technician.
 
 Since Kasliwal’s family is into furnishing business, he did not receive any formal training in farming. 
 
 “When I started farming, I had no knowledge of agriculture so I started to observe farmers’ works, then I started reading books on agriculture, experimented with techniques and sometime applied my own brain in the process,” he said.
 
 Kasliwal told TOI that farmers in MP grow soya beans while he grows urad dal, millet and juwar at his farm. 
 
 Three years ago he stopped using cow dung and other natural compost materials and switched to natural farming. Along with Kasliwal, Verma, who is a mechanical engineer and product designer, is working on creating different models of solar cooker.
 
 Currently Verma, who has been active in designing various art forms out of metal scrap, is interning at Indore-based Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. 
 
 At the conference, Verma has put on display his solar cooker made out of concrete. He told TOI: “A conventional solar cooker needs fixtures while the model that I have made needs a single mould.”
 
 Twenty five-year-old Verma plans to create solar dryers in near future and help farmers, who use this dryer, to become entrepreneurs. “The dryer will help farmers to store their surplus crop produce and sell them at a later stage. Apart from this, they can also sell the dried products in different forms in the market,” said Verma.
