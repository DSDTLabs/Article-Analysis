The latest episode of Bigg Boss Marathi witnessed the fourth eviction of the show. The episode started with   singing the song 'Zindagi Kaisi Yeh Paheli Haaye' which depicted the current situation in the house.

 Then   had a discussion with the housemates though 'Majhya Baacha TV'. He firstly played a game with all the contestants. There were crowns kept in the living room which had various human qualities written on it. The first quality was ‘over-smart’. Everyone in the house had to vote for the person they feel is over-smart. Sai got the majority of the votes and hence, was crowned with that quality. The other qualities were group changer and boring. Jui got the crown with the tag of ‘boring’ written on it.
 
 After this game, Mahesh connected the audience with the contestants via phone call. The first call was for Sushant. The viewer asked   that in spite of knowing Megha even earlier, why is he feeling that she is talkative only now? Sushant answered that before the show, he used to meet Megha only during events and he didn’t know her much. But now, they are housemates spending 24 hours a day from the past 50 days. So he felt that she is more talkative. 
 
 After all the calls, Mahesh assigned a task to everyone in the house which they had to do in the next ‘Weekend cha Dav‘ episode. According to this activity, the housemates were divided into two groups. Each group was asked to mimic people from the opposite group.
 
 Then Mahesh played a new game with the nominated contestants. He asked three questions related to each of them. If the housemates replay ‘NO’ to the question, then the nominated contestant has to go through a punishment. The punishments were drinking bitter gourd juice, dipping face in a plate full of flour and eating a fist punch.
 
 From the nominated contestants, Jui, Sai, and   were in the danger zone. But finally, Mahesh declared that Jui has been evicted whereas Aastad and Sai were safe.
