NEW DELHI: Thirty-one years after he was accused of leaking "secret" information, a former senior government official was absolved by a Delhi court on Wednesday, saying the investigation had failed to establish that they were classified "secret" documents. 

  Special   judge Kamini Lau acquitted Dr  , who was an advisor to the Department of Electronics under the Centre in 1987, and a businessman   observing that the CBI had failed to prove a conspiracy angle. 
 
 "The prosecution has also not established a conclusive link connecting each individual circumstance with the other, and the accused. Crucially, the material and evidence on the record do not bridge the gap between "may be true" and "must be true" so essential for a court to record a finding of guilt of an accused...," held the judge.
 
  The accused were acquitted of the offences of criminal conspiracy under the   and penalties for spying and wrongful communication of information under the Official Secrets Act. 
 
  Significantly, the court held that there was total failure on the part of the prosecution to establish that the note on "Operational Requirement of Utility helicopters for the  " and the "User/Evaluation Trial Report on RATACS Battlefield Surveillance Radar (BFSR), PhaseI" were classified "secret" documents. 
 
 The CBI had filed a case on April 17, 1987, after it received a complaint from a courier company in Delhi that certain secret documents related to defence matters were being dispatched by the accused.
