 Meanwhile, officials claimed that unnecessary chain pulling incidents under Indore railway station jurisdiction have decreased.
 
 Senior officials said that it takes at least five minutes to start a journey after chain pulling. As per records, chain pullers often used to do it for fun. Several times, during rush hours, passengers used to pull the chains at their desirable stops as fast trains do not halt at  .
