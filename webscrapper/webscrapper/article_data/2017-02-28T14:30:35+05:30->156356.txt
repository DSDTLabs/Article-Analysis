GUNTUR: Defending senior   leader  's claim for an MLC ticket, a joint action committee of Dalit, BC and minority organisations has appealed to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu to keep his promise of naming a Dalit eader to the upper house. 

 The leaders said that Pushparaj had been serving the party for over three decades despite being sidelined by the party leadership. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, SC welfare organisation state general secretary Medida Baburao said that they were disappointed when Pushparaj was not named as   member six months ago. He demanded that Pushparaj be named as MLC from the MLAs' quota. "Pushparaj is a highly educated person from the Dalit community and has been serving the party for over three decades," said   leader M Bhagya Rao. 
 
 BC Sankshema Sangham state president Angirekula Anka Varaprasad said they would meet TDP national general secretary Lokesh and Naidu in support of Pushparaj. "If we cannot protect honest and dedicated leaders, it will be difficult to protect morals in democracy," said Varaprasad. 
 
 He observed that party should keep its promise of recognising the services of loyal leaders in order to win over the people's faith.   leader Chennakeshavulu, minority leader Shaik Khaja Vali, RPI leader GR Bhagath Singh and others were present.
