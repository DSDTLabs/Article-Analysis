When Preeto ( ) asks Surbhi ( ) if she faked the ankle sprain, she replies in the affirmative.

 Harman ( ) and Soumya ( ) dance in sync with each other, much to Preeto's disappointment.
 
 Police reach Harak Singhâ€™s house to find the abducted grandson of Kishanlal. Harak Singh is left with no option but to allow them to inspect the house.
 
 
 
 They search every cupboard in the house including the one in which Chintu was hidden. But they don't find him there. A furious Harak Singh seeks revenge from Kishanlal by putting black mud on his face. 
 
 When they leave, the police inspector calls the number from where they had received the call. It turns out to be Surbhi's. Everyone is left dazed.
 
 When Soumya tries to explain that it cannot be Surbhi, Maninder, in turn, blames her for doing the misdeed.
