CHENNAI: Two days after the pro-jallikattu protests turned violent and riots rocked areas near the Marina Beach, normalcy returned in areas like  ,   and   even as several houses remained locked with locals staying away fearing police action.

 Although the remnants of the riots -- pelted stones and damaged vehicles -- were visible, residents could be seen going about their daily business. Women could be seen carrying out their routine household chores.
 
 A few women TOI talked to recalled in hushed tones how outsiders trickled in steadily during the agitation. The people, who chiefly wore black clothes and were not students used some of the houses for their daily needs, also offered a lot of money to the locals, said a few women from the kuppams.
 
 “They lived like part of our own family and moved freely with us. They gave us Rs 20,000 for cooking purposes,” said Pichaimuthu* of Ayodhyakuppam.
 
 For seven days of the agitation, the outsiders, who claimed themselves to be protesters, came home late and left early in the morning. When the crowd at the Marina thinned, the protesters asked   to join them. “We don’t know who they were. We were asked to join the protest Sunday night onwards as the crowd was less,” said Pichaimuthu’s wife.
 
 “Some of them spoke to us in flowery language and said our support was vital to intensify the protest,” said Narayanan* of Nadukuppam.
 
 But things got out of hand on Sunday evening when hundreds of people stormed the kuppams and begun distributing Rs 500 notes along with packets to biryani, asking residents to join the agitation. “During riots we could only see them hurling petrol bombs at the police force. They ran helter-skelter when the police chased them,” says Saroja, a resident of Sivarajapuram. “Though our children were not involved, policemen chased them without knowing that it was mostly the outsiders who triggered the riots,” she said.
