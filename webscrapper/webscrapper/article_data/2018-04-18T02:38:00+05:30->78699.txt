 Dumping construction waste at unauthorised spots will also invite a penalty ranging between Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000. “There is a prevalent tendency among builders and residents to dump construction waste on road. From now on, anyone found indulging in this practice will be penalised up to Rs 50,000,” added Rai.
 
 Fruit and vegetable vendors setting up stalls and kiosks on main roads, will have to pay a fine anywhere between Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000.The GDA has also made a provision to impose fine on using and selling of polythene bags. This will draw a fine ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000.
