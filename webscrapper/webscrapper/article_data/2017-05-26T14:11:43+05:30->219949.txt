MOHALI: A residential society's top office-bearer and his accomplices on Thursday terrorized around 500 people living in the flats by opening fire in the air after a drinking session in the middle of the night at Sector 127 in   on Sunday.

 According to a complaint filed by the residents, president of the society and four tenants fired several rounds in the air around 11.30pm. One of the residents said, "following the firing all families in the society were panicked and they came out of their houses. We did not have the courage to stop the hooliganism and scared of calling the police. However, next morning we checked the   footage and saw around 10 people standing in the open parking area and firing in the air."
 
 The CCTV footage, in possession of TOI, shows that a group of persons coming out of the elevator and two others walking down the stairs. One of them has the gun in hand. They all gathered in the parking area and took turns to fire in the air using the same gun. Four shots were fired by three persons. Sources claimed that three of the group own flats in the society and others were tenants.
 
 Residents said they know the people involved in the hooliganism. However, they have not named anybody in the complaint to the police.
 
 The society residents have been complaining about several illegal activities by these goons but no action has been taken till now. Over the past one year the residents had reported several incidents of throwing bottles, playing loud music, threatening residents, molestation, and fights to the police station. A senior citizen living in the society said all the residents were terrorized and living in fear in the society. "We feel threat to our family," he added.
 
    said he was not aware of the incident and promised to take appropriate action as per law after investigating the case.
