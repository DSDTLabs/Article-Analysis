Navi Mumbai: Kharghar residents will start a signature   addressed to the chief minister and  , highlighting the acute drinking water problem in the node which has a population of over 2 lakh.

  The node has been getting around 55 MLD (million litre per day) of water supply instead of the standard 70 MLD. The campaign will be held from 6pm onwards on April 4 at Shilp Chowk.
 
 The idea of conducting the campaign came from a resident, Mangal Kamble, who wanted to bring the issue to the notice of concerned authorities.
 
 “We have suffered enough due to erratic supply. Residents get 30 to 60 minutes of supply a day and this is insufficient. During a shutdown residents are forced to bear the brunt for 4 to 7 days. When our persistent complaints did not yield any result, we decided to gather public opinion through the campaign.”
 
 Residents from various sectors have been complaining that Cidco has failed to live up to its promise of supplying uninterrupted water when the node came into being as the biggest in south Navi Mumbai. 
 
 Areas at a higher altitude are reported to be the worst hit as the pressure of water is mostly low. 
 
 Many have complained that Cidco has reduced the volume supplied to Kharghar in order to divert additional water to Ulwe and Dronagiri. Cidco has, however, refuted the claims.
 
 “Last week a pipeline rupture in Jabhulpada disrupted the supply for more than 5 days. Prior to that, early last month a shutdown crippled the supply for a week which made us to depend on tanker water. We are at the mercy of Cidco. which supplies far less than the amount allocated to Kharghar and a sustaining campaign is the need of the hour,” said Satish Yadav, a resident. 
 
 Assistant engineer of Cidco water supply department, Rajesh Haatvar said, “The supply has been commensurate with the minimum demand. But, people suffer during the breakdown slots.”
