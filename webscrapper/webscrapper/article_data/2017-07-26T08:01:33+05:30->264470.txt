MUMBAI:  , a 53-year-old share broker, is perhaps one of the few   of the ill-fated   who has an alternate accommodation in the city. But that's the last thing on his mind right now as he's worried about the fate of his wife and daughter. 

 While Ajmera received minor injuries, his wife Divya succumbed to severe head injuries and their 25-year-old daughter Nirali is still missing.
 
 The family had sold their flat in the building and was to shift in less than a week to a new flat they had bought nearby. "I had bought a flat in a nearby building and we were to shift there. I had called a carpenter home who was measuring the old furniture. I was having a cup of tea when I felt the building shaking and heard shouts to run down. I pushed my wife and daughter out of the house, they may have reached the second or first floor when the building crumbled," said Ajmera from his hospital bed.
 
 His friend said Ajmera was unable to hear properly due to the impact of the crash and has not been informed of his wife's death. 
 
 "He is very traumatised by the tragedy, we don't want to give him any news which may affect his heart. So we haven't yet broken the news of his wife's death to him though she was admitted next to his room in the ICU in Lokhande hospital at  ," said the friend. Ajmera has also not been informed that Nirali was missing in the crash.
 
 Ajmera's carpenter Mansooklal Gajjar (75) too perished in the crash, the only casualty who was not a resident of the building. Ajmera was getting the new flat painted and furnished, for which he had called Gajjar who has been doing his work for years. "Gajjar was my wife's brother. He told my wife on Tuesday that he was going to Ajmera's flat for furniture measurements. Then we heard about the   and hence we rushed to see him," said Gajjar's brother-in-law Chetan Brisloni.
