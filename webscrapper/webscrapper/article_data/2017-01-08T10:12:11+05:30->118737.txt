CHENNAI: Racquet stringer   had to wait for two decades, but finally he has made the Grand Slam cut.

 Shivkumar, who has been a constant at Chennai Open since 1996, stringing racquets for the participants, will now make his 'Slam debut' later this month at the  . He has been roped in by Yonex ­ one of the leading manufacturers of sporting equipment in the world ­ to string racquets for the first Grand Slam of the year.
 
 "I will be the first Indian to go to the Australian Open to string racquets for players. All these tournaments have official contracts with companies to do this job. Yonex is the official stringer for the Australian Open and I am part of the Yonex team," Shivkumar told TOI. 
 
 Having strung racquets for   when he reached the Chennai Open final in 2008 and the likes of   and Novak Djokovic during the International Premier Tennis League, the Chennai man has done everything someone in his position could aspire for. Shivkumar feels "attitude wise Nadal is great". "I'm proud to have done it for him.
 
 I have also done it for Federer and Djokovic when they came for the IPTL," he said. He doesn't know for whom he will string racquets during the Australian Open. "That's not up to me. We will be working as a team. If a player chooses someone specific that he wants the racquet to be strung by, then that's different. This will be the first time for me. So, I am not sure about how things happen in Grand Slams. It will be a good experience for me," he added.
 
 Shivkumar hopes that the Melbourne experience will only be the beginning. "My association with Yonex started a couple of years back. Let's see how they use my service. Every company is now forming a team and when they are approached for tournaments, the team takes care of it. If I continue being with Yonex, I will probably be doing more tournaments," he explained. Interestingly, Shivkumar's main source of income is from a coffee business that he runs in Coorg.
