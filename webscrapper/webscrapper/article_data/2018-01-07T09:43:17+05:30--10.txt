CALANGUTE: Thirty years after it was first proposed, is the   beach promenade finally taking shape?

 The land for the project had been acquired three decades ago. Then, in June 2014, chief minister   laid the foundation stone for the ‘Candolim beach promenade beautification’. Its scheduled completion time was three months, but that too did not happen. 
 
 Interestingly, the land that was acquired was from the family of a local ex-MLA’s wife. But the erstwhile Congress-led government had reverted it to its MLA’s family. In 2012, when the   formed the government, it was re-acquired by the state. 
 
 Actual work on the project commenced only a few months ago. In September, Calangute   Michael Lobo had told   that the project would be ready by December. That deadline, too, has lapsed. However, the work is going on, and may be completed soon.
 
 Once done, it will have a changing rooms, toilets, pay parking zones, a children’s park and a tourist information centre.
