Newbie   had everyone going ‘fidaa’ over her till she hit the dubbing studio. The actress, who has been cast opposite   in Pathikrit Basu’s Fidaa, turned heads in both Kolkata and London, but developed cold feet as she was asked to shed her accented Bengali for the film’s dubbing. Now, two lovely ladies — Debaparna Chakraborty and Payel De — have agreed to lend their helping voice to the hottie. The women will take care of the voice modulations as   undergoes a transformation in the film. Meanwhile, Sanjana had an unexpected guest visiting her on the sets. It’s none other than Ankush. He came down for a casual hello and also to find out if all was well with her on a day the film’s hero, Yash, was missing from the sets. Being friendless in the film industry is not an option.
