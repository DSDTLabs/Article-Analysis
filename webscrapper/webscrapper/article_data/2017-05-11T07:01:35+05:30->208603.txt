NEW DELHI: A   being built under a power transformer has led the Delhi   to rap the authorities responsible. A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Anu Malhotra expressed concern and pulled up the   government along with the north   for putting lives of people in “extreme danger.”

 “This is incredible,” the bench observed when it found that a   had been allowed to be constructed near the transformer. “How can you do this? Don’t you have experts, who can assist you? Is there any building bylaw or not for the city,” an irked bench demanded from the corporation, wondering why it granted permission for such a construction in the first place.
 
 The court asked the authorities to produce before it their proposed plan on the next date of hearing on May 18, so that it could take a view of where and how the urinal can be relocated. “You are directly putting the life of users under danger,” the bench said adding that the project should be put on hold for some time.
 
 “Safety and security of people are under question. Mere digging has started. It would be better to stop the project for some time,” the court pointed out seeking further details of the project. It also issued notice to the government and the corporation and has sought their replies.
 
  was acting on a plea by the RWA of Sultanpuri, which had moved the court seeking direction to the authorities to restrain them from constructing a public urinal under the transformer in the locality.
 
 The petitioner claimed that the transformer can be extremely dangerous for users of the urinal, arguing that sooner or later there is bound to be a mishap of some kind.
