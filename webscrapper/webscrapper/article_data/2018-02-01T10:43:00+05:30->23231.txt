KOCHI: With increased tension at   (CUCEK) campus over the ‘beef row’, authorities have decided to indefinitely close down the campus.   students had alleged that they were fed beef and when they protested, they were assaulted inside the campus.

 “We have decided to indefinitely close down the campus from today (Wednesday). Meanwhile, we are also trying to resolve the issue,” said   (Cusat) vice-chancellor J Letha. The decision was taken after the talk between Cusat and striking north Indian students failed on Wednesday. Of the 3,500 plus students at CUCEK, around 500 are north Indians.
 
 
 At the meeting, Letha said an inquiry will be conducted and the report will be submitted within four days based on which action will be taken. The students were told that if they had missed any exam over the past few days, then the university would conduct a re-exam after the inquiry. “To ensure a safe environment for students, they were also promised police security on campus,” said an official who was present at the meeting. However, the students didn’t agree and insisted that college principal   should be immediately suspended for ‘hurting the religious sentiments of the north Indian students’. Cusat authorities rejected this demand and said action will initiated only after an inquiry is conducted.
 
 Tension started at the campus after a digital banking awareness camp last Thursday. North Indian students alleged that they were misled into eating beef cutlets by saying that the item was vegetarian. On Monday, students protested at Cusat and authorities promised to conduct an inquiry. However, problems arose on Tuesday after north Indian students went on strike after talks with faculty and principal to resolve the issue failed. “Few of our friends were assaulted by goons allegedly sent by the principal. No one is willing to listen to our woes,” said   Ankit Arvind, a third year (computer science) student.
