LUCKNOW: UP Strongman   has told ET that he will meet CM   soon and could offer to step down as the   candidate from Kanpur.
 
  ET had reported on Tuesday that   had refused to let   be the party candidate from Kanpur seat after he was granted ticket by the   faction. Ahmed, who faces many serious criminal cases including charges of murdering a BSP MLA, met   patriarch   in Lucknow on Wednesday.
  
  Speaking to ET later, he said: “For me, the formation of a secular government is more important than entering the Vidhan Sabha. My main aim is that there should not be any dent in Akhilesh’s image. I will meet him to find a wayout.” When asked if this included stepping down as the party candidate from Kanpur, Ateeq said this was very much on his mind.
  
  “I will definitely propose this to the CM...I will discuss with him and decide my future course. Mein woh naya mareez nahi hun jise electionladne ka shauk chadh ho (I am not a newbie when it comes to fighting an election).
  
  Humein CM ki chavi se zyada pyaar hai (I love CM’s image more). I also do not want division of votes and harm the party’s chances,” Ahmed told ET.
