MUMBAI: Maharashtra   chief Sunil Tatkare may be on his way out following a chargesheet filed in the Kondhane irrigation project scam. 

 Although Tatkare has not been named as an accused, the ACB said that his role is under investigation.
 
 The   government has taken the stand that Tatkare has not been given a clean chit. “Either Tatkare will resign on his own or he will not be considered for a fresh term during the December organizational elections. NCP chief Sharad Pawar will decide Tatkare’s fate,” said a senior NCP leader. 
 
 But Tatkare said he will not quit. “Party leaders have not asked me to quit. I am not an accused in the case and the probe is in progress. I am cooperating with the investigators. 
 
 Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had on December 12, 2014, granted permission to the ACB for conducting an open inquiry against Ajit Pawar and Tatkare for their alleged involvement in the irregularities. Tatkare’s statement was recorded by ACB on October 20, 2015, while Ajit Pawar’s statement was recorded on October 21, 2015.
 
 In the run up to the 2014 Lok Sabha and assembly polls, BJP had successfully launched a campaign against NCP leaders over corrupt practices, particularly in the irrigation department. It was alleged that there was corruption to the tune of Rs 70,000 crore. “While the total cost of the irrigation projects that were approved between 1999 and 2014, stood at Rs 70,000 crore, the BJP successfully campaigned that there was corruption of the same amount,” the NCP leader said.
 
 If Tatkare quits, former speaker Dilip Walse-Patil, former home minister Jayant Patil and NCP leader Shashikant Shinde are being seen as top contenders for his post.
 
 NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said he was unaware about any such move.
