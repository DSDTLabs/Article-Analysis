Mumbai: After its failed fund-raising attempt last September, private sector lender   on Thursday launched another plan to raise up to $750 million (about Rs 4,900 crore) from institutional players at a price band of Rs 1,455-1,500 per share with the floor price at Rs 1,499. On Thursday, Yes Bank stock on BSE closed at Rs 1,516.

 Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors,  ,   and   are managing the qualified institutional placement ( ), which is set to close on Friday morning.
 
 In September last year, through a similar QIP offer, which was reportedly being managed by as many as 11 merchant bankers, Yes Bank had tried to raise about $1 billion (about Rs 6,650 crore then). However, after failing to raise the target amount, the bank and the merchant bankers were investigated by Sebi for alleged lapses, including breach of rules relating to disclosure of information. Sebi has yet to come out with the final report on its investigation on the Yes Bank QIP.
 
 On Thursday, in its disclosure to the bourses, Yes Bank said it has set the floor price at Rs 1,499 per share with the base size of the QIP offer at $650 million and a $100 million upsize option.
