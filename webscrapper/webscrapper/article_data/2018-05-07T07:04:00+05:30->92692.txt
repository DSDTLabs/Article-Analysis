GREATER NOIDA:   mastermind Shyam Vohra and his three accomplices who were arrested from a highrise apartment in Greater Noida on April 20 for allegedly running a betting racket, have been granted bail within 15 days of their arrest on Friday.

 The four accused have been released from jail on Saturday.
 
 Shyam Vohra, Shailesh Agarwal, Ankit Agarwal – all residents of Agra and Jatin, a resident of Sonipat, were arrested from a rented flat in Jaypee Greens Society of Greater Noida and Rs 21 lakh in cash, 40 mobile phone sets, three laptops, two wi-fi modems, one mobile signal booster antenna, three LED TVs and one printer were seized from them.
 
 SHO, Kasna, Brijesh Verma told TOI that all the four accused have been granted bail by the court of the additional district judge on Friday.
 
 “They were released after completion of all formalities on Saturday,” he said.
 
 While the release comes at a time when the   is in full swing, police have said that in order to prevent the accused from starting betting again, they will be booked under Goondas Act.
 
 “We will initiate proceedings under Goondas Act against them soon,” Verma said.
 
 After the STF arrested the gang members and took them on remand for nine hours on April 26, they were handed over to the Kasna police.
 
 The STF had said that the four had told cops during questioning they used an application — Cricket Liveline — which gives real-time updates on cricket matches for betting.
 
 Since the updates given by the app are a few seconds earlier than those in TV channels, the bookies would put a bet on each ball. A participant would be considered to have lost the money if his prediction was incorrect, officers had said.
