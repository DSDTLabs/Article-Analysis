 Go for slim, not skinny. Anything skinny and you’re in jeggings region. Slim-fit   embrace the thighs, knees, and calves, and loosen up around your lower legs - and look fresh, sharp, and spotless.

 
 Best suited for men looking for a laid-back cut. If your hips are smaller, or you have a belly, even big thighs – pick this fit.
 
 
 Classic fits are great for everyday use. But a free-fit underneath the knee can bring about some flare. Always try the denim, check the flare and then pay up. 
 
 
  Men who are tall and have big hips should make this a go-to piece. Simple reason being, an enlarged hem will perfectly balance the length of your body.
