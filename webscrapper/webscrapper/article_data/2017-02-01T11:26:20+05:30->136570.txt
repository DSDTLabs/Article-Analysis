BHUBANESWAR: Over four years have passed but   is yet to get completed. It is coming up between Mancheswar and Barang railway station as a   to the one at Master Canteen here. 

 Earlier, the   (ECoR) had set a target to complete the station by the end of 2016, but now it has extended the deadline to May-end.
 
 According to the plan, the Rs 50-crore project would have nine tracks and seven platforms alongwith two foot overbridges. But only four tracks have been completed. Floor work of platforms is yet to be finished. "Construction of   will take some time. Though work of station building, staff quarters and approach road is over, technical and mechanical work are yet to be executed," said a railway official. 
 
 "The work got delayed as the contract agency fixed by   Limited failed to complete the work in time and a new contract came into operation. We expect that the work will be commissioned alongwith the third line work connecting Barang-Bhubaneswar by May 2017," said ECoR chief public relations officer (CPRO) J P Mishra. 
 
 The railways planned the new station because it faced difficulties in handling heavy traffic at the city station that has only six platforms. The existing main station witnesses more than 140 trains daily. Most of the South-bound trains originate from the new station, ECoR sources said. The New station will be close to Barang, Nandankanan, Raghunathpur, Kalarahanga and Patia. It is just 1.5 km away from Nandankanan. 
 
 The new station would have proper lighting system, parking facility and approach road. In the future, the railways would develop washing lines in the new station.
