LUCKNOW: The Lucknow   Rail Corporation on trial basis brought into effect   on Sunday for people going towards   Instead of taking the   directly, people will have to drive about 100 metre extra on the left and take a U-turn at the intersection near the petrol pump to access the flyover. This diversion takes commuters 10-15 minutes extra on weekend and is likely to take more of their time on working days. 

 As of now, the diversion is on trial basis for 2-3 days. After traffic police gives its nod, it would be permanent for two years. SP Traffic told TOI, “We have given them permission for trial on the condition that they widen road by removing encroachments and shift poles and police booth on the way. Badshahnagar is a busy traffic area and two lanes are required to accommodate the Nishatganj & Mahanagar traffic going towards Indiranagar.”
 
 At present, there is not enough space on road to accommodate traffic on both sides. The congestion increases during rains when roadsides are waterlog heavily at the crossing. Also, being close to the railway station, passengers’ traffic increases on road during arrival of trains. Traffic police has asked Lucknow Metro team to work on all these challenges and bring a suitable plan for diversion. 
 
 Lucknow Metro officials said, “We will gradually modify routes according to traffic police instructions. Right now, we are doing it on trial basis. Since weekend didn’t see much vehicles on road, the real challenges will be identified on Monday, especially during office hours.”
