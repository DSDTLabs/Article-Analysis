Surat: A 22-year-old woman lodged a complaint at women’s police station here on Wednesday against her husband for giving her triple talaq at the doorsteps of their residence. The couple got married in 2015 and soon the woman’s in-law started harassing her for dowry of Rs 5 lakh. The couple became parents of a girl child in 2016 and this only created more problems because her in-laws started to thrash her too,  

 A spectacle shop owner Imtiyaz Poptani, his father Razaq, mother Firoza, sisters Sumya and Sima and a relative Hafsa Memon, all residents of Muglisara, were booked by the police on a complaint by Imtiyaz’s wife Sana.

 Meanwhile, the woman went to stay with her parents in Bharuch. Imtiyaz went to meet her and told her that he will make arrangements for them to stay separate from his parents. The complainant went to stay with her husband, but her in-laws did not allow her to enter the house, following which her husband gave her triple talaq at the doorsteps.
 
 Police have registered a complaint and started investigation in the case.
