AURANGABAD: Union minister of state for human resources   on Friday questioned  's theory of evolution of humans, saying it was "scientifically wrong" and needs to be changed in school and college curriculum.

 "Nobody including our ancestors have written or have orally communicated that when they went to a jungle or a town, there they saw an ape turning into a man," Singh, a former IPS officer turned politician, told reporters on the side-lines of the All India Vaidik Sammela held here on Friday.
 
 "No books which we have read since our childhood or the stories told to us by our grandparents ever had the mention of this theory," Singh added. "Jabse dharti par aadmi aaya hai, admi hi hai aur aadmi hi rahega" (ever since a man was seen on an earth, he has been a man and will continue to remain man), he added.
 
 Singh, the former commissioner of Mumbai and Pune police, said that Indian scientists who are working abroad had said "35 years ago" that Darwin's theory (of evolution of humans) is scientifically wrong. Hence, there is a need to "correct the wrong" by effecting a change in curriculum and books for schools and colleges, the minister said.
 
 This is not the first time that Singh has made a controversial statement. In October 2015, he had said that the Dadri lynching a 'small incident". In September last year he had said that the Indian students should be taught that an Indian called Shivakar Babuji Talpade was the first to invent the airplane, eight years before the Wright brothers. He had also said that students should be told about ' ', the flying chariot in myathological Ramayana, and about Vishwakarma, a Hindu deity worshipped by craftsmen. Subsequently in December 2017, Singh had said that no boy will be ready to marry a girl who comes to the   (wedding stage) in jeans.
