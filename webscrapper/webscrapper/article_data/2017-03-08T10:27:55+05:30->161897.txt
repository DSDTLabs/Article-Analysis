ROHTAK: A 52-year-old man from Hisar died after he was punched in the face by a co-passenger he had an argument with while travelling on the   on Tuesday morning.

 Hisar resident   was headed back home from Delhi when he got into an argument with a group of passengers over sharing a seat on the train. As tempers flared, one of the co-passengers punched Chand in the face, making him fall unconscious. The cause of his death is yet to be ascertained. Though a post-mortem has been conducted on the body, the report is expected in the next few days.
 
 The incident occurred when the train had stopped at Bhiwani railway station. The attacker and his friends fled the train after the assault, while Chand, who lived in Hisar’s   locality, was rushed to a hospital, where he was declared brought dead.
 
 Investigating officer assistant sub-inspector   (GRP), Bhiwani, told TOI that Chand was travelling with a friend, Naresh Kumar, when the incident occurred. He, however, said the police were yet to register a case because Chand’s family had said that they would file a complaint after his body would be cremated on Wednesday.
 
 Satyapal said they had taken CCTV footage of the railway station in their possession and would nab the suspects soon. “Investigations are on. The case will be closed soon,” he said.
