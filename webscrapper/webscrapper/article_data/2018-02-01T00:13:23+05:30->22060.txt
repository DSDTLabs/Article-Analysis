Indore: It was a visual treat for residents of Indore as they witnessed the rare blue moon as full lunar eclipse took place on Wednesday.

 While several temples, including famous Khajrana, remained shut owing to this cosmic event, the stargazers were awestruck to watch the super big and super bright- red blue moon.
 
 Such astronomical phenomena happen after a long interval so people should watch it, said secretary, Children's Science Centre, Rajendra Singh, who had put a telescope and a big screen for people to witness this occurrence at a ground. "The moon seems to be quite big and bright as it is a supermoon. This moon is also called a blood moon because of its red tint. Now, it will occur next in 2037," he said.
 
 A total lunar eclipse is when the sun, earth and moon line up perfectly, casting earth's shadow on the moon. This lunar eclipse has happened after a span of three and a half decades when the blue moon synced up with a supermoon. 
 
 While the children were seen thrilled to witness it for the first time, the adults were equally excited about it. Retired engineer, Rupendra Guchade who has witnessed several eclipses was as delighted as kids around him. "It was during the old times that the people would stay home. But, I believe, people should watch it as it's a rare and a beautiful sight to experience," said the 65-year-old.
