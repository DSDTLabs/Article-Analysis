LUCKNOW: Beleaguered   patriarch   has been offered the chance to head  , a party he was closely associated with over three and a half decades ago.

 Lok Dal chief   told TOI: “We will give Mulayam the position his son has snatched from him...we will make him national president... the party and the election symbol, farmer ploughing field, both would be his).” Singh said Mulayam’s brother   and SP MP   had contacted him on January 1, when the Akhilesh camp’s chief strategist   had called a national convention of the party to replace Mulayam as SP chief.
 
 He said he met Mulayam earlier this week after talks between Akhilesh and the SP patriarch failed.
