AHMEDABAD: Security arrangements were tight at the BJP’s ‘Vijay Vishwas Karyakarta Sammelan’ venue on the Sabarmati riverfront on Wednesday. At the six entrance gates, vigil was particularly sharp because senior police officials were worried about   ( ) activists entering the venue posing as the BJP’s booth-level workers.

  “We had circulated images of some of the mischief-makers on WhatsApp among officers posted at various entrances,” said a senior IPS official who was posted near the dais. “The officers at the VIP entry were asked to screen visitors and ask for their identity cards.”
 
 The official said that a few days earlier they had put a few mobile numbers under electronic surveillance for any leads or plans to disrupt the meeting. A senior police inspector explained how they were on tenterhooks after   workers had lined up from the airport till the Sabarmati venue in small stretches to welcome the BJP president. “In an earlier visit, on March 7, some unidentified PAAS workers had thrown eggs on Amit Shah’s convoy,” said the senior police official. “We did not want a repeat of that incident. Some 5,000 workers had lined up to welcome Shah, and each was screened.”
 
 A senior BJP figure in the organizing committee of the event said that special care was taken while handling party workers from Saurashtra and  . The other aspect that worried BJP organizers was heat. For this, the organizers had installed mist-makers and 900 fans. Peanuts, water, and cool drinks were continually served to workers who were waiting at the venue for Shah for three hours.
