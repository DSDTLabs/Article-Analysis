On a television chat show a few weeks ago, Arbaaz   revealed how his big bro   rarely takes a break or goes off on vacations. In fact, it is known that even when the actor is unwell, nothing really stops him. Salman, who is currently shooting for his next 'Tubelight', has torn a ligament on his leg, and the pain is so excruciating that he’s practically limping.

 He’s been popping painkillers to douse the pain during his shoots and recently, he also performed at the 62nd Jio   2017 with his injured leg. His brothers are concerned that bhai is pushing himself too much, and they want him to go a little easy. 
 
 On Monday, in the midst of the ongoing promotions for Raees, Shah Rukh Khan joined Sallu on the sets of 'Tubelight', to shoot his cameo in the film.
