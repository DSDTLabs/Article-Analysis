BENGALURU: A copious monsoon has wiped away the gloom of the ban on sale of   and has left the excise department laughing all the way to the bank. For the first time in a long time,   plummeted in 2016-17 thanks to the ban. This year, though (2017-18), sales and revenue have made a smart recovery.

  
  
 
 Drinkers consumed 28 lakh more cartons than the previous year, hiking the department’s revenue to Rs 17,806 crore (total Rs 18,050 including licence fees and other revenues), from Rs 15,717 (total Rs 16,484 crore) the previous year.
 
 “The previous year (2016-17), people reeled under the effects of drought,” a senior excise official said. “The year before too was one of drought and it affected sales in 2016-17. It saw sale of beer dip by 8% and   by 1.4%,” he added.
 
 Industry sources, though, attribute the increase in sales to multiple reasons, including a good monsoon. “Monsoon is one reason,” said Karunakar Hegde, general secretary, Karnataka Wine Merchants' Association ( ). “And while it may not be the only reason, it certainly was a major contributor to the dip in 2016-17.”
 
 A carton of IML (Indian made foreign liquor) contains 8.6 litres of spirit, while a carton of beer contains 7.8 litres. This means beer consumption increased by 1.63 crore litres in 2017-18, while IML increased by 58 lakh litres.
 
 In the year ending March 31, 2018, a total of 565 lakh cartons of liquor were consumed as against 558 the previous year. This includes an increase in beer consumption — from 244 lakh cartons to 266 lakh cartons. “In 2016-17, sales dipped in rural areas, especially in North Karnataka,” S K Shivaiah, excise director, said. “Kalaburagi, Raichur and neighbouring districts were reeling under drought. With good rain, we have managed to recover this year.”
 
 Month-wise analysis of the data shows that on an average, the excise department sold between 48 lakh cartons and 50 lakh cartons, while the average monthly revenue collection was about Rs 1,480 crore. Beer sales contributed to about Rs 2,000 crore of the total revenue.
 
 However, revenue from licence fees dipped from Rs 590 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 585 crore — largely because some bars and wine stores went out of business due to the highway ban. Although the total sales in volume during 2017-18 increased compared to 2016-17, it did not match that of 2015-16.
 
 Shivalingaiah, president, Liquor Manufacturers’ Association, attributed this to the dip last year being more than the average growth.
 
 “But you will see an increase in collections as the department has increased additional excise duty last year,” he said. “There is a proposal to raise it further in this year’s budget.”
