Gandhinagar: In just five hours, six bills were debated and cleared by the ruling Bhartiya Janta Party in state assembly on Wednesday. These included the bill for a new Birsa Munda Tribal University and that for Gujarat Organic Agricultural university, among others.

 Interestingly, Congress opposed only one of the six bills the Gujarat Maritime Board (amendment) Bill, 2017, in which the government removed the provision for administration charges being computed at the fixed rate of 15% of maritime revenue, and stated that the rate would now be decided by the state government every year. tnn
