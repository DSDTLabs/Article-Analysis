Chamarajanagar: AICC president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday challenged the BJP to change the Constitution, which some of the Union ministers and BJP workers were advocating for. He said if it happens, the Congress will not remain silent. Rahul, who started his speech by acknowledging the achievements of Mysuru ruler Tipu Sultan, Maharaja Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar and Dewan of Mysuru Sir M Visvesvaraya, took a dig at the NDA government over its “anti-Constitution” stand. \ “Ambedkar and the Congress fought for this Constitution which is the pillar of our democracy. BJP is trying to change it to impose its agenda. I will not allow this to happen. I challenge BJP to touch the Constitution,” he said. The Congress, which is looking for a hat-trick clean sweep at Chamarajanagar as since 2008 it is winning all the four assembly segments in the border district, sought to address the Dalit concerns in the reserved Lok Sabha segment. It inducted prominent Dalit leader A R Krishnamurthy into the party.
