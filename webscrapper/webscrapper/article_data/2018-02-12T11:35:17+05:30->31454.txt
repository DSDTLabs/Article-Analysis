SHRAVANABELAGOLA (HASSAN): Jaymala Appaso   is 93 but that didn't stop her from climbing the   to catch a glimpse of the 59-foot-high statu e of Lord  . Khot brushes aside any questions about her age. "This is not the first time I'm climbing the hills. I have climbed Vindhyagiri 78 times till now," she said. 

 Khot is not alone. Septuagenarian and octogenarian   are all taking the stairs, even the steep climb to reach the top, considering it a command of Lord Bahubali and his blessing that they have the strength to do so.
 
 Khot, who is from Rukadi in Kolhapur, scaled the Vindhyagiri for the 79th time, accompanied by her younger sister Dr Jayakanta Badabole, a pediatrician. "I had absolutely no difficulty in climbing the hills," the 93-year-old said. 
 
 "Though we had hired a doli to help my sister reach the top of the hills, she decided to take the steps," said Badabole. Khot told TOI it was a matter of devotion. "I'm here to accept what God gives me. The strength which God has is the strength which I too shall imbibe on my way up the hill. This is what drove me while climbing each step." 
 
 Septuagenarian Kempamma from Hassan, on the other hand, climbed the Vindhyagiri hills to see the magnificent statue of Bahubali for the first time. "I have never climbed even a flight of stairs in my life but it seems like it is God's wish . I took just 20 minutes to reach the top," she said. 
 
 Deviramma, 90, from  , is on her second visit to Shravanabelagola. "I did not feel any strain while climbing or getting down. My family members accompanied me and the scouts and guides helped us all along the route by providing assistance and water," she said. 
 
 Spurred by these women, 67-year-old Rukmini   too decided to climb the steps. Mahajana, from   in Belagavi, rested every now and then to beat dehydration. "I'm climbing the hill for the fourth time. I want to visit Shravanabelagola again and climb the steps to see Bahubali," she said.
