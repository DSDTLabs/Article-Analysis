GURUGRAM: Days after the power discom issued a week’s ultimatum to cash-strapped   to clear Rs 3.25 crore dues and threatened to disconnect the supply to the water treatment plants in case of non-payment, the Haryana government has come to the rescue of the development body.

 Recently, Dakshin   (DHBVN) had issued a notice to Huda, asking it to clear the hefty dues that it owes to the discom. Following the order, Huda had sought funds from the state government to avert disruption in the water supply. 
 
 “The state government has approved Rs 14 crore, but the funds have not been released yet,” senior Huda official said, adding that the development body would settle the dues as soon as they got the funds.
 
 Every month, Huda spends around Rs 8 crore to supply water to the city. Of this, around Rs 3.25 crore was spent on power consumption, while the rest is used for maintenance and other work. As many as 11 motors work round the clock at the water treatment plants — Chandu Budhera and Basai — and boosting stations at sector 5, 16 and 51 to supply water. The development body owes Rs 3.25 crore to the discom for the amount of electricity consumed by it every month. Huda spends around Rs 75 lakh to run Chandu Budhera water treatment plant, and Rs 2.50 crore to run Basai plant a month. 
 
 Power is used to run three boosting stations in sectors 51, 16 and 5, which supply water to households in different sectors. Water comes to these boosting stations through main pipeline from Basai and Chandu Budhera water treatment plants (WTP), and then is distributed to different sectors.
 
 At present, Gurgaon needs 90 million gallons water per day (MGD), of which 70 MGD is supplied by the Basai water plant, while the remaining 20 MGD comes from the Chandu Budhera plant. The Basai and Chandu Budhera treatment plants get Yamuna water from Kakroi village in Sonipat through 70-km-long   and   Channel.
