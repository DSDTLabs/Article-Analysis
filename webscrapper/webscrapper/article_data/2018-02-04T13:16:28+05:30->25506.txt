CHANDIGARH: The ongoing digging work near the roadsides for   with the medians is giving rise to new problems. A dug-out section near the Sector 24-25-37 roundabout has gathered water from and underground pipe that got punctured while digging.

 The water that had filled the pit completely had also spilled on to the road at certain points and had reduced sections of it into mud patches, increasing the danger for skidding accidents. The ditch, with a high concentration of mud and gravel, has become filthier because of the water accumulation. “The situation has remained like this for a few days. The water was leaking two days ago as well and even yesterday (Friday) probably,” said a rickshaw-puller stationed nearby.
 
 The digging has also left the edges of the road muddy, while the   with stones, mud, and gravel. It has narrowed a major portion of the path that witnesses a huge   at most parts of the day. “Every time the water supply is restored, this ditch gets filled to the brim and sometimes the water even overflows. The   has now started to smell and become a breeding ground of insects and mosquitoes,” said a passerby. 
 
 Wires from a nearby electricity pole are also fallen into the water. Flung all around, these have created a clear danger of electrocution injuries. “What if these wires have current running inside? Anyone can get electrocuted if they step into the water. Street children also play on the road. Someone of them could get injured easily,” said Shivani Gupta, a passerby.
 
 
 
 
 When confronted about the problem, municipal corporation senior engineer   said: “We are in the process of getting all the roadsides and electricity poles fixed and will come this spot soon.”
