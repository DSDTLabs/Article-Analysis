PUNE: A   has directed the prosecution in the   to file its say over the defence counsel Milind Pawar’s application for   against the government officials concerned for the delay in the appointment of a special public prosecutor.

 Shaikh, an IT professional, was killed during a mob violence triggered by an objectionable post on the social media on June 2, 2014 in Hadapsar. The police later arrested 21 suspects, including Hindu Rashtra Sena chief Dhananjay Desai.
 
 Pawar stated before additional sessions judge R M Sardesai on Wednesday that the delay was causing injustice to Desai, in jail for over three years without any proper evidence. As many as 18 co-accused are out on bail and Desai’s provisional bail plea is held up since May 5.
 
 Simultaneously, lawyer S H S Kazi moved a plea on behalf of complainant Mobin Shaikh and intervener Azhar Tamboli, seeking adjournment “in the interest of justice” to enable the state appoint noted lawyer Rohini Salian as the special prosecutor. 
 
 On June 12, lawyer Ujjwal Nikam withdrew from the case as a special prosecutor and Shaikh’s family is since trying to get Salian appointed to fight their case. Salian has given her consent but the papers related to her appointment are pending with the law and judiciary department.
 
 Pawar pointed out that the Bombay high court, while admitting for final hearing Desai’s plea for discharge from the case, observed on April 13 that there appeared no connection between the alleged crime and the applicant/accused and the application of criminal conspiracy needed a thorough consideration.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Pankaj Dahane said, “On a query from the law and judiciary department, we have recommended Salian’s name as special prosecutor in the case.”
