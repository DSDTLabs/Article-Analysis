KOLKATA: For a team which finished last in the previous two seasons,   couldn't have hoped for a better start in IPL-10. The new-look outfit, with   at the helm and   as head of cricket operations, won their first two games with great ease.

 Wicketkeeper-batsman   feels that the Maxwell-Sehwag duo has been instrumental in bringing about a change in the mind set of the players. "We all know how aggressive a player Maxwell is. He is leading the side in the same way on the field," Saha said on Thursday, the eve of Punjab's match against   at the Eden Gardens.
 
 And Sehwag's advice to the Punjab boys is to play freely, 'without thinking too much'. "Virubhai tells us, 'if your job is to score 20 off 10 balls, then just go and express yourself '. That was evident in both our matches. We chased down targets in 15-16 overs, which is a big plus for the side," Saha said.
