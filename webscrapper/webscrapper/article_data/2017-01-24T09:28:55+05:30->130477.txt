NASHIK: The crime branch of the Nashik police on Monday conducted search in houses of three history-sheeters who they suspect could be involved in the murder of the   worker  .

 The crime branch swung into action, conducting its maiden raids, after the case was handed over to it by   police station, after the latter was unable to make any headway in the case. Shejwal was stabbed to death by unknown assailants at Jail Road late on Friday night.
 
 Assistant commissioner of Police (Crime)   said a team of crime branch conducted house searches of three goons who are suspected to be involved in the murder. “The trio is from Nashik Road area,” added Gore, refusing to divulge the identity of these goons, who are absconding after the murder. However, the police did not find anything substantial from the houses of these goons. The city police have already formed three special teams for tracing the absconding criminals.
 
 The police said while one team was investigating the case in Nashik, the other two have gone to the neighbouring Ahmednagar and Malegaon districts. Senior police officials said they were investigating the case and the culprits would soon be arrested.
 
 “We have got leads in the case and three teams are working on those leads. We are confident of solving the case soon,” police officials added. 
 
 As per the complaint lodged by Vikram Porje, who was with the victim at the time of the murder, suspected Pappya — brother of a deceased goon Pintu — keeping a watch on them.
