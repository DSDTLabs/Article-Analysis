TIRUNELVELI: A 26-year-old spurned lover attacked a woman using lethal weapon in Tirunelveli on Tuesday morning. Thinking that the woman succumbed to injuries, the attacker rushed to his house and committed suicide by hanging. The seriously injured woman was rushed to a nearby hospital, from where she was referred to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital since the injuries were life threatening.

 K Saravanan, a daily wage labourer hailing from Kalyanipuram village near Kadayanallur in Tirunelveli district, was in love with one T  , 27, from Rajangapuram village near Alwarkurichi. Although Saravanan often approached the woman to marry him, she never reciprocated. As his efforts failed, Saravanan approached the woman’s family members seeking her hand as both belonged to the same community. 
 
 Police said that Kalpana’s family rejected the proposal outright and started looking out for an alliance. This irked Saravanan. As his wish was not fulfilled, he decided to kill the woman and commit suicide. Armed with a lethal weapon, he went in search of her. He found her in nearby   and expressed his wish for one last time. As she wanted him to leave her alone, he took out the weapon and attacked her.
 
 The injured woman fell down at the spot in a pool of blood. Police said Saravanan thought that the woman was dead and decided to end his life. He rushed to his house and hanged himself. People in the vicinity rescued the woman and rushed her to her hospital. Kadayanallur police registered a case and are conducting inquiries.
