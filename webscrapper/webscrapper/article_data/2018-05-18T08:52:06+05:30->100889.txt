CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government on Thursday suspended  , chairman of Haryana Staff Selection Commission ( ), for the derogatory question asked about Brahmins in the written exam to recruit junior engineers. An officiating chairman will run the commission till Bharati is suspended.

 The government has also decided to conduct an inquiry, preferably by a retired high court judge, to find out how the question sneaked into the test paper. Besides, it has been decided to register an FIR against the Delhi-based company that got the contract to set the question paper, the paper-setter, and the publisher.
 
 TOI had reported on May 6 that one of the multiple choice objective questions in the paper read, ‘Which among the following is not a bad sign of omen in Haryana? — Empty pitcher, a casket full of fuel, meeting with a black Brahmin and sight of a Brahmin girl’. This had upset the Brahmin community in Haryana which had demanded action against HSSC officials.
 
 State education minister Ram Bilas Sharma said they wanted a retired high court judge to investigate the issue as HSSC is an autonomous body. The advice of the Haryana advocate general is also being sought.
 
 Sharma added that HSSC issues directions to a company to set the paper and instructs it to abstain from using objectionable language for any community, caste, organization or group. Though the company that won the contract has tendered an apology, the government has blacklisted it along with the publisher from all future assignments.
 
 R S Chaudhary, former bureaucrat, and national secretary of INLD, called the decision to suspend the HSSC chairman an eyewash because his appointment is contractual in nature. “HSSC is already under fire for cash for jobs scam and instead of suspension, the controversial chairman should have been fired by the chief minister to uphold the dignity of the institution,” Chaudhary said.
