AMRAVATI: Dr  , state vice-president of Indian Medical Association (IMA), has alleged that the central government is trying to dissolve the democratically constituted   (MCI) and replace it with a ‘bureaucrat-filled, non-democratic’ National Medical Commission.

 Addressing a press conference here today, Lunge said that IMA is opposed to this. He said that instead of bringing in the Commission, the Centre should bring in necessary amendments to the MCI and retain it. He said that to protest this move of the centre, among other things, the IMA is staging an agitation in Delhi on June 6.
 
 He said that members of IMA from across the country will gather at Raj Marg, Delhi, at 8 am on June 6 and walk to Indira Gandhi stadium before submitting a memorandum to Prime Minister  , demanding a central Act for protection to doctors from physical attacks and assaults and guarantee of quality of generic medicines. 
 
 The other demands include cancellation of NEXT exam for MBBS passouts, holding MBBS final year exam at national level, holding PG NEET exam within 45 days of declaration of MBBS final results and starting internship training on the same date throughout India.
 
 non-registration of criminal cases against medical practitioners for medical negligence, and implementation of the recommendations made by the centre-constituted inter-ministerial committee.
