THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The assembly on Wednesday passed the bill making   in all the schools in the state. The   was presented before the House by   C Raveendranath. 

 With enactment of the law, a child who gets admission on Class I now will pass the SSLC examination only if he or she studies Malayalam. The language will have to be taught compulsorily from Class I to Class X in every school.
 
 In the language minority schools, at present, three languages are being taught. 
 
 Now they will have teach Malayalam also along with the other languages. For them, the SCERT will bring out special Malayalam textbooks.
 
 The government will insist on the teaching of Malayalam when CBSE and ICSE schools apply for no-objection certificates. This is the need of the society, said the education minister. 
 
 In these schools, three languages are being taught till Class VIII. The government is planning to introduce new Malayalam textbooks that could be taught from Class IX in such schools.
 
 The minister said that the enactment of the law is a revolutionary move as the government is making sure that no child in the state will come out of the school without knowing our mother tongue.
