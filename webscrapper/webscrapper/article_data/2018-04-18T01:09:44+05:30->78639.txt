NEW DELHI: A   and his   were   on Monday for   a 14-year-old   in   two weeks ago.

 The accused, who was the girl’s neighbour, raped her in front of his friends who made videos of the act and blackmailed the girl threatening to upload them on social media.
 
 Police said the main accused had been allegedly sexually exploiting the girl by threatening to circulate the videos through various free messaging applications.
 
 The girl’s family was unaware of the sexual assault. They filed a complaint only when somebody told them on Sunday about the videos on internet and social media platforms. A case under relevant sections of IPC, POCSO Act, and IT-Act was registered.
 
 A senior police officer said the main accused is a distant relative of the girl. The other two men also lived in the neighbourhood. “We raided the suspects’ hideouts and arrested them on Monday. The main accused works as a labourer. The mobile phone that was used to record the videos was also seized,” police said.
 
 The accused used to visit the Rohini girl’s house frequently. Two weeks ago, he allegedly lured her to his house, where his two friends were already present. 
 
 “The neighbour raped the girl while his friends recorded the act. He showed the videos to the girl and threatened to leak them if she told anybody. The neighbour then started blackmailing her,” police said.
