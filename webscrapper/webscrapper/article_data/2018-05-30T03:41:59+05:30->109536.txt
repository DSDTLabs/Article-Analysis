MUMBAI: A   tailor's son,  , topped the arts stream of the gruelling three-year military and academic training at the National Defence Academy. He will now realize his dream of joining the Indian armed forces in a year. 

 After scoring 91% in the Class XII board exam, Mittal joined the commerce stream, But he later, cracked the   entrance examination and the Services Selection Board ( ) interview in the first attempt. "I got inspired to take up a career in the armed forces after joining the   (NCC) in Class VIII. NCC changed my outlook towards the armed forces," he told TOI on the sidelines of the NDA's convocation ceremony for the 134th course on Tuesday. 
 
 His father, Kiran, runs a tailoring shop in Malad. He said, "It's a great occasion for us. No one from our family has ever served in the armed forces. Mittal has always been brilliant in studies. He has taken all decisions himself. We only supported him. He did not have any coaching classes or tuitions even for the NDA entrance test."
 
  subedar G T Reddy, currently posted in Goa, echoed similar feelings for his son,  , who stood first in the science stream in the three-year course. Naveen studied in Sainik School at Korukonda in Andhra Pradesh before opting for the NDA.
 
 A second-generation soldier from his family, Naveen said, "My father has been my inspiration and he always supported and encouraged me. He not only instilled discipline but also familiarized me with the ethos and ethics of the Army, which helped me to pursue my dream."
 
 SS Bisht, the topper in BSc computer science stream of the course, is an alumnus of Delhi Public School, Ghaziabad. He said that he wants to join the special forces of the army.
