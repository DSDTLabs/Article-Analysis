MUMBAI: The   on Tuesday directed   to give an   to allot land for a cemetery for Sunni Muslims at   before April 3. “It is your obligation. It is not charity,” said a bench headed by the chief justice hearing a PIL.

 The court reacted after it perused BMC’s reply which said it proposes to give 3,000 sq m for the kabrastan and incorporate it in the draft development plan. “Nothing is definite. You are only proposing,” said the bench. It also rebuked BMC saying later it may give the proposed plot to a developer for a price.
 
 The HC noted that BMC proposes to earmark an area for the cemetery only after consulting other parti-es. “This is definitely not a commitment with certainty. This is only a proposal which will fructify after consideration with stakeholders,” it added. The bench allowed MLA Ashish Shelar to intervene in the matter “if he wants to help” but warned that if it finds no merit, it would throw out his plea and impose cost. tnn
