BENGALURU: Every day for the past two months, a scene at the RR Nagar police station seldom varies. Chandrashekar, a bank employee, walks in and asks police if they have arrested the accused who abetted his daughter’s suicide. The cops say no and   leaves disappointed.

 C Meghana, Chandrashekar’s daughter, a first-year civil engineering student at  , committed suicide at their apartment in west Bengaluru on February 7. In her complaint to police, Lata Chandrashekar, Meghana’s mother, claimed her daughter, 19, was harassed in college which led her to take her own life. She accused four of Meghana’s classmates and a coordinator of abetting the suicide. The five are absconding, “Their plea for anticipatory bail was turned down by a sessions court and the five accused approached the high court,” Chandrashekar said.
 
 Lata said her daughter was harassed because she was a CET candidate. “Right from Class 1 to 12, Meghana was a rank student,” Lata said. “A few weeks before her death, she was to appear for exams. The examiner gave her the question paper but just when she was set to begin writing, the examiner snatched her papers saying she was short of attendance. “All colleges inform parents about attendance. Why did the management fail to bring this to our notice? It was an intentional insult,” Lata added. She claimed the four accused students were now attending classes.
 
 Ravi D Channannanavar, DCP (west) said the accused will be arrested soon.
