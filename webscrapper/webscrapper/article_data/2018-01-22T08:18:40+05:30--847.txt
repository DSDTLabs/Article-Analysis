LUCKNOW: Despite frequent ceasefire violations and heavy exchange of fire with   forces on the international border and across Line of Control, Union minister for external affairs   helped a Lucknow boy, living in the bylanes of Old City, tie the knot with his Pakistani fiancee last Friday. 

 The 'nikah' of   (27), an engineer from Agha Mir Deodhi area near   and   (24) from Karachi, was solemnised by senior Shia cleric and vice-president of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Maulana  .
 
 The couple got married on Friday and their reception was held on Saturday.
 
 The marriage of Naqi Ali Khan and Sabahat Fatima had been fixed almost two years ago but cross-border tension caused visa hassles for the bride.
 
 A TOI report from Lucknow in July about a similar case kindled hopes and Sabahat took to social media and contacted Sushma Swaraj last year. The minister helped the couple and granted visa to Sabahat. 
 
 "Our families are related. But were divided when the two countries underwent partition. The groom's maternal grandmother and the bride's paternal grandmother were sisters and lived together in Lucknow before partition," said Naqi's elder brother,  . 
 
 Incidentally on Sunday, the couple watched a Bollywood movie in which the female lead plays the role of a Pakistani and the male lead is an Indian. 
 
 "Both of us are extremely grateful to Sushma Swaraj for this great gift. We are hopeful that the Indian government will help us in getting Sabahat Indian nationality as well," said the couple.
