CHENNAI: After carrying out a nationwide Kisan Mukti Yatra with 193 farmer unions across 22 states last year, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), has created and submitted two Private Members’ Bills in the Parliament. The bills, which they claim are “of the farmer, by the farmer, for the farmer,” ask for two legal rights for all farmers in India — Freedom from Indebtedness and Guaranteed Remunerative Prices.

 On May 10, AIKSCC will discuss the bills in a public event that will take place at the ICSA Centre in  , in which farmer leaders, activists and consumer forum members will participate.
 
 “May 10 is a historic date because it is when India’s first war for independence began in 1857. After getting over 1000 signatures each, from more than 500 districts across the country, two memorandums addressed to the Lok Sabha speaker and the   chairperson will be submitted to District Collectors. These memoranda urge the Speaker and Chairperson to do everything in their power to push these Bills to fruition in the Parliament,” says Ananthoo, coordinator of  , which is one of the members of AIKSCC.
 
 The Kisan Mukti Yatra traveled through all regions of the India between July and November 2017. 
 
 The rally culminated in a   or Framer Freedom Parliament in November 2017, wherein over one lakh farmers congregated in a mock parliament in Delhi, with activist   as the speaker. “That is where the first draft of these bills were tabled and discussed in detail,” says Ananthoo. 
 
 Subsequently, with further inputs from agricultural and legal experts and farmer unions, the bills were taken to 21 political parties for support, who assured to take it up and support in the parliament. On May 10, the bills will be discussed by PUCL Secretary Dr V Suresh, farmers rights activist   and other experts.
