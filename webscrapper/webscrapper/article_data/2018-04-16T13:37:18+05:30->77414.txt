LUDHIANA: The police on Saturday booked a man for allegedly raping his 21-year-old neighbour in the city. 

 In her police complaint, the woman said, “In June 2016, the accused came to my house and sought my help to look after his ailing mother. I accompanied him to his place. As his mother was in poor health, I returned home to get medicines for her and went back to tend her. After some time, the accused brought me a lemonade. I fell unconscious after consuming it.” 
 
 When the woman gained consciousness, she found herself in another room. 
 
 “The accused had spiked the lemonade, raped me and filmed the act. He then started blackmailing me with the video. Threatening to upload it on social media, he raped me repeatedly. He even extorted money from me. Whenever I refused to pay him up, he abused and thrashed me,” she added. 
 
 The complainant said she sold her gold jewellery to meet his demands, but he did not stop. 
 
 Pushed to the wall, the woman apprised her parents of it and they took her to the police station to lodge a complaint. 
 
 The police have registered a case under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). 
 
 Investigating officer sub-inspector   said a manhunt has been launched to   the accused.
