Amaravati: Chief minister N Chandrababu  , who is currently attending the World Economic Fourm meet in  , met a host of business leaders on Wednesday. 

 He held discussions with UPL global CEO Jai Shroff. The CM invited UPL, an agricultural technology developer, to the state with their innovative products that could help in water conservation and related areas.
 
 UPL has come up with two innovative products, one which retains and releases 2,000 litres water, which is enough for one acre of agricultural land. The system stores water when it is available, and releases it when the moister level comes down in the agriculture field. 
 
 The system will help in fighting the drought conditions, and aid farmers in saving their crops. Another system developed by UPL regulates the flow of fertilisers in the field, and ensures supply as per requirement. 
 
 Impressed by the two systems, the CM invited the UPL chief to the state to help farmers save their crops. Naidu also briefed him on the state governmentâ€™s initiatives in water harvesting and crop saving. 
 
 Later, the CM met president of Nanyang Technological University, Subra Suresh, who briefed him about the university and the campus. Suresh also invited the CM to visit their campus in Singapore to study the best practices followed there.
