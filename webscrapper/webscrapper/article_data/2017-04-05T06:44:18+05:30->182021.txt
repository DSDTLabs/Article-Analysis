HYDERABAD: As many as 15 corporate colleges in the city were issued show cause notices by the   (BIE) on Tuesday after they were found conducting classes in violation of a   declaring summer holidays from March 29 to May 31. 

 “Within Hyderabad district, we issued notices to about 10 colleges, of which three each were issued to Sri Chaitanya and Narayana Junior Colleges. The same has been also forwarded to the secretary of BIE. Once we get orders from him, action will be initiated against the colleges,” said C Harindranath, district intermediate education officer (DIEO), Hyderabad. 
 
 The other five colleges issued notices are in Ranga Reddy district. Officials said all the erring colleges have been asked to respond to the notice within two days explaining why they were conducting classes during summer holidays. 
 
 “We caught the colleges red-handed during raids conducted on Tuesday and asked them to close the institution. If they repeat the mistake, we will lock the college next time,” said the DIEO. The raids will continue for a few more days till all the colleges in the district are covered, he added.
 
 Mahmood Ali, DIEO of Ranga Reddy, also said that checks on colleges will go to ensure none are violating the BIE order. “We have created enough awareness through SMS and mails and asked the colleges to shut down for vacation. But when we conducted raids, a few colleges in   and   were found holding classes,” he said.
 
 The move was welcomed by both parents and students. “Every year, the colleges do the same thing. Unless BIE takes stern action and cancels the affiliation of some colleges, they won’t fall in line,” said Gopi Krishna V, parent of an Intermediate first year student.
