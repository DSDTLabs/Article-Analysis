NAVI MUMBAI: There was high drama in Navi Mumbai on Wednesday afternoon as   and Panvel fire officers tried to convince an inebriated 27-year-old   standing on the edge of his third floor flat window not to jump off. They managed to ‘rescue’ Sahil Bhagat, but he later confessed that he had staged the suicide drama to pressure the police as they were to issue his  .

 
 Bhagat was booked for   under Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code and his four friends, including a college girl, who were in the flat celebrating a birthday party, were taken to the police station and questioned. 
 
 “Bhagat has cases of rioting, unlawful assembly and assault against him at Khandeshwar and Kamothe police stations,” said ACP (Panvel division) Prakash Nilewad. “As we were in the process of his externment, he staged the suicide drama to pressure the police to show leniency in legal action against him. On Wednesday afternoon, he dialled the police control room number and said he was about to jump out of his flat window as someone was coming to kill him.” A police team rushed to Sector 7 in Khanda Colony. “We found him standing on the window, threatening to jump off,” said senior inspector Yogesh More. “While we tried to talk him out of it, firemen spread a large net below the window as precaution. By then, three policemen and a few firemen broke open the flat door and pulled him to safety. 
 
 Police sub-inspector Vaibhav Ronage said the friends claimed they tried to calm Bhagat down, but he called the control room, climbed onto the window and warned them against opening the door for cops. They said they did as told as they were scared of him.
