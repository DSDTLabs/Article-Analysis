CHANDIGARH: After TOI reported about attendance certificate being issued by PGIMER and   ( ) without attending the workshop, the office of the dean academics,   has drafted a plan on how to avoid such ‘errors’ in future. The same shall be sent for approval in the staff council meeting. 

 Last month, TOI had reported that it was easy to get a certificate of participation for a dissemination programme of ICMR and PGIMER on National Ethical Guidelines, 2017 without attending it. It was the first time that the ICMR has started online registration for the program. “We had asked the organizer from PGI and after getting the details, have felt the necessity to lay down a guideline that can enable transparency. Once we are joint hosts, as an institute, we can ask for cost audit of the events, be responsible for issuing certificates,” said the dean academics.
 
 After TOI informed the organisers, an email of withdrawing the certificates was sent immediately. Taking cognizance of the TOI’s report, the institute had immediately sent a circular to avoid such errors in future.
 
 However, the ICMR blamed it on the less manpower available on registration desk to verify the credentials of the participants. Also, no credit was given to the attendants as it was a dissemination workshop. “These things bring bad name to the institute. Once the draft is endorsed in the meeting, we will be able to monitor such activities,” said the dean. 
 
 “We have investigated the case and found that all relevant permissions had been taken to host the event. However, there is no clarity on what the permission implies when PGI is one of the collaborators. For this, we have elaborated about the role and what all responsibilities shall be taken by PGI for such joint  ,” said Prof  , dean academics, PGI.
