Surat/Ahmedabad: Highest number of students from the diamond city and district secured position among those scoring A1 grade in class XII science results announced by Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) on Thursday on Thursday.  In all, 63 students from Surat city and district scored A1 grade while from 136 from entire Gujarat scored the same grade. Of the 63 students, 21 were from Ashadeep Vidhyalay in Varachha. Hetvi Patel, daughter of a tempo driver and student of Madhavbaug School, came out with flying colours despite her family’s poor financial condition. Hetvi never let her family’s financial condition become a hurdle in her studies.  Her father Dhaval was earlier into construction work but due to accident that left him with serious leg injuries, he had to switch his work. The passing percentage of Surat centre was also higher compared to state average. Out of total students who appeared 78.77% students cleared the exam as compared to state percentage of 72.99 percent.  Over all, there was a 9% drop in the percentage of successful candidates in the state as compared to last year. The state government had abolished the semester system in June 2017, and this is the first HSC (science) results where students were assessed entirely upon their performance in the class XII board exams.  A total of 98,067 students out of 1,34,352 students who appeared for the higher secondary (science) examination passed the exam. Students in ‘A’ group with mathematics posted 77.29% pass rate while the pass rate of ‘B’ group students with biology was 69.77%. This year, once again, the girls did better than boys with 74.91% girls passing the exam as against 71.84% boys. English-medium students once again fared better than their Gujarati medium counterparts posting 75.58% pass rate. The same for Gujarati medium was 72.45%. Out of 213 centres where the examination was conducted, the results of Dhrol in Jamnagar was the best with 95.65% pass rate, while that of Bodeli centre in Chhota Udepur was the lowest at 27.61%, GSHSEB said. Last year, Gondal had topped with 98.77% pass rate while Silvassa was the lowest with 39.09% pass rate, said board officials. Among districts, Rajkot secured the highest pass rate at 85.03% while tribal-dominated Chhota Udepur district recorded the lowest percentage at 35.64%. A total of 42 schools recorded 100% pass rate, down from 118 such schools in 2017. The number of schools securing 10% or lower pass rate also improved to 26 compared to 44 schools last year in the same bracket, the GSHSEB said. Object preview had to award 15 grace marks to students in the HSC science examination to increase the pass rate, which otherwise would have been only 62%, the poorest result of the decade, say sources in the education fraternity. GSHSEB chairman A J Shah, however, refuted the contention and said, “We have given grace marks according to the rules and the board has already made the rules public on its website. According to the rules only five grace marks can be given.” About the poor result, education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma said the board will analyse the results of 2018 with those during semester system and find a way to improve the situation. “We will also find out why there was a drop in the pass rate,” Chudasama said.
