KOLKATA: Demolition of the buildings that have come up in the way of the New Garia-   project continued at a slow pace on Monday to keep the traffic around the structures moving. 

 According to officials of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation ( ), the work has been slowed considering that one of the structures - an "  hotel" - is adjacent to the New Town-Sector V flyover and there is continuous movement of vehicles.
 
 The other four structures facing the backhoe loader include Mahisgote Primary School and three small two-storey structures. Demolition of the two-storey structures is almost over but razing the school is taking time. "The area under the flyover - where the buildings are located - is congested, and even after putting up barricades, movement of traffic can't be completely restricted," said an official.
 
 "Yes, the demolition work is slow. We are waiting for the buildings to be pulled down," said  , executive director of  , the implementing agency.
 
 The corporation is now eyeing relocation of 40-odd shanty dwellers, who have encroached on government land. Civic officials had identified the land - where the shanty dwellers will be given makeshift homes - on Monday.
