Vadodara:  , a millionaire arrested by   (GRP) for stealing a laptop in a train, was sent to jail on Saturday as his police custody ended.

 A team of Pune police also came to the city on Saturday to arrest him.
 
 Patel was arrested by GRP officials from Ahmedabad railway station on February 23 for stealing a laptop from   train on February 20. 
 
 Interestingly, Patel has his travel business in Haridwar and lives there with his family. He also owns a guest house in Haridwar besides four buses. 
 
 Patel was caught in 2012 too in Viramgam and Ahmedabad in similar incidents but he was released on bail. 
 
 The police said his lawyer in Ahmedabad had called him after which he went to Bhimashankar Temple in Maharashtra. “He was returning to Ahmedabad in a second AC coach and when the train was about to reach Surat, he woke up and stole the bag of his fellow passenger  ,” said in-charge GRP police inspector Natwarsinh Chavda.
 
 Chavda said he got down at Surat and went to Ahmedabad by bus. Police sources said when Patel reached Ahmedabad railway station to book his ticket, GRP personnel recognized him as he was arrested in the past too and questioned him. 
 
 “Strangely, he revealed all the details of the incident even before we used force against him,” said a police official.
 
 He told police that he had a habit of stealing other passengers’ valuables whenever he travelled in an air-conditioned coach of a train. And because he did not want to steal luggage of fellow passengers, he started travelling by road. 
 
 But, on February 20 he got a confirmed ticket so he travelled by train. The police recovered cash and other valuables worth Rs81,070 from Patel, who they said suffers from kleptomania.
 
 He had stolen mobile phones when he was in Pune for which Pune police will be arresting him soon as a court has issued a transfer warrant against him.
