DOHA: It was the myriad expressions - that went from a rather furious exchange with his box, to those now-familiar, vacant smiles he sports when things aren't going his way, to rallying the crowd when he saved breakpoints and then match points - that best described the World No. 2  's play in the roller coaster first semi-final of the  .

 Only when it was all done, after 2 hours and 22 minutes of action, having fought-off five match points, but not without help from his opponent the veteran Spaniard  , did the defending champion flash the smile of a winner. Djokovic came through 4-6, 7-6(7), 6-3 and could run into the World No. 1   in Saturday's final.
 
 Djokovic said he couldn't describe his come-from-behind win, where he saved match points in the tie-break, in one word, but said: "Tough luck for Fernando, he was clearly the better player out there. He should've won. He had some mid-court forehands which he didn't convert at match point. I hung in there, made him play the extra ball."
 
 For most of the match though it was Verdasco, cheered on by girlfriend  , half sister of singer Enrique Iglesias, who dazzled. He had a wobble though in the sixth game of the first set. His forehand tipped the tape, surrendering the first break of the match, but otherwise the 33-year-old was in top gear against an opponent who hadn't dropped a set all week.
