Rapper   is reportedly dating producer   and the pair were seen being very affectionate in Mexico over the weekend. 

 The 26-year-old rapper flew to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, with the music producer over the weekend and the pair have done nothing to hide their closeness while staying on a yacht, reported Us Weekly magazine.
 
 "They flew in together on a private jet for a friend's birthday. They have been all over each other with major PDA. They rented a yacht and were making out on the deck. 
 
 "They went jet-skiing and he gave her piggyback rides on the beach," a source said. 
 
 LJay - whose real name is Lorne Currie Jr - shared a photo on Instagram of himself on the yacht, while   used her account on the social media site to wish their pal a happy birthday.
