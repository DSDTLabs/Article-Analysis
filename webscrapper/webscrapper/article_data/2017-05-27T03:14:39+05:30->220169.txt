GURUGRAM: A couple was shot at by four unidentified assailants inside their house in Chandpur village on Friday.

 As Kishan did not have any information about his son’s whereabouts, the accused asked him to give them Kumar’s mobile number through which they could contact him directly. 
 
 Unaware of what would be coming next, Kishan pulled out his mobile phone from his pocket, but one of the accused suddenly open fired at him with a bullet piercing into Kishan’s thigh.

My mother, who was in another room, rushed out hearing the gunshot, the assailants fired at her too. The accused also attacked my wife who tried to intervene and save my parents. They hit her on her head and threatened to kill everyone in the family. As neighbours started gathering hearing my wife’s screams, the four accused fled the spot,” said Pardeep Kumar, younger son of Kishan.
