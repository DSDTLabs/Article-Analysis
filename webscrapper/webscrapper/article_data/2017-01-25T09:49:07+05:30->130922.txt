PATNA: The state police headquarters is yet to give its nod to   police’s proposal of installing of 31 automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras in the state capital. The proposal was sent to the police headquarters a couple of months back.

 All the 11 ANPR cameras currently available with Patna police are installed at the entry and exit points of the city. Of them, only eight are functional. Besides, the Patna police also have 150   cameras at its disposal.
 
 Senior police officers said installation of ANPR cameras on roads would go a long way in curbing crime in the city. “The accused in the recent molestation of two sisters at   crossing could have been identified much earlier had ANPR cameras been installed on the road. The normal CCTV cameras had failed to give a clear footage, making it difficult for the police to know the registration number of the motorcycle used in the crime. ANPR cameras can capture the number plate even if a vehicle is moving at a high speed,” they added.
 
 Patna SSP   said a proposal for installation of 31 ANPR cameras was sent to the police headquarters a couple of months back. “We are still awaiting clearance from the police headquarters,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, IG (provision) Pankaj Kumar Darad said  , a private firm, has been asked to prepare a detailed project report vis-à-vis the Patna police’s proposal of installing 591 CCTV cameras and 31 ANPR cameras at different locations in the city. Darad, however, said the state police headquarters would ask the Patna police to think of reducing the number of CCTV cameras it has proposed to install in the city. “Once the Patna police comes up with the revised number, purchase and installation of cameras would begin in full speed,” he added.
 
 The police headquarters is also planning to install surveillance cameras with night vision capacity at 2,300 locations in Patna, Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur and Darbhanga zones. 1,200 such cameras would be installed in Patna alone.
