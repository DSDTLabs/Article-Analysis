HYDERABAD:The   (UoH) has banned consumption of alcohol narcotics in the varsity premises with immediate effect.
The move comes days after the university put restrictions on   and   within the campus.
 
 In a circular issued on Monday, the university authorised the security staff to check and confiscate inflow of liquor inside the campus.
 
 “The security staff is authorised to check and confiscate inflow of liquornarcotics into the campus and also intervene, if anybody is found consumingcarrying liquornarcotics in the public open spaces on the university campus and its premises,“ states the circular.
 
 Officials said some students consume liquor on lake beds and have damaged the university property. They also alleged that students organise bonfire parties wherein they consume alcohol.
 
 The university registrar   said that safety , security and academic tranquillity is an “inescapable precondition to uphold the quality of education and research in institutions of higher learning“.
 
 However, a section of students have opposed the move saying the university is only curbing freedom of students by frequently issuing such restrictions on campus.
 
 “It is a university and not a school, wherein the administration must impose such restrictions on us. Students within the campus are matured enough to decide for themselves,“ opined Pradeep Kumar, a student.
 
 The university said that disciplinary action will be initiated against those violating the norm.
 
 “Any attempt in violation of the above orders will be viewed seriously and appropriate disciplinary action will be initiated against those involved, based on the complaints received from the security or any other member of the university community,“ reads the circular.
