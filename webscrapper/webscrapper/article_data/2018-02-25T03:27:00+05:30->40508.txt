Panaji/ Mapusa: An altercation between two Nigerians at Girkarwada,  , on Saturday evening resulted in the death of one, police said.

 Sources said four foreigners were near a banyan tree on the way leading to Arambol beach when an argument broke out between two of them, both Nigerians. As the fight escalated, one stabbed the other twice in the back. 
 
 “Two of the gang members drove the victim to a private hospital in Anjuna. He was fine till he was admitted, but he later succumbed to his injuries, by which time the duo left the hospital,” North Goa SP Chandan Choudhary, said. The victim, identified as Prince Ekene Agbo, was about 26-28 years of age.
 
 Pernem PI Sandesh Chodankar said Agu Frank Godwin, a Nigerian, was later arrested and that Kingfley, another Nigerian, was on the run. The complainant in the case was ex-president of the Nigerian community in Goa, Johny Young Ikhile, he added.
