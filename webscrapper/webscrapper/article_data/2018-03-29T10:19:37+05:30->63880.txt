CHENNAI:   registered against 33 workers of  , by the   district police, have been quashed by the Madras  . The cases were registered against them under Section 141 (unlawful assembly) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of the IPC, after they protested against a church which had built structures, and sought to conduct festivals and processions atop a hill in Acharappakkam.

 Two separate   were filed against a total of 33 workers. Assailing the charges, advocate Rabu Manohar, counsel for Hindu Munnani, contended that a charge under Section 141 could not be made out since there was no proclamation of an order under Section 144 of the CrPC at that point of time.
 
 Accepting his arguments, Justice M S Ramesh quashed both the chargesheets. The Hindu Munnanani had organised a dharna in the  , demanding the removal of the structures put up by another religious group illegally atop a hill. They argued that it was a reserved forest area where such activities were totally prohibited.
