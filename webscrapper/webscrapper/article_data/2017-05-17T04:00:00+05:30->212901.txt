Surat: Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will soon be developing floating labour transit accommodation centres at Athan-Bhatar and Bhestan in the city. This unique project, which is being attempted in the country for the first time, will be run in association with Credai and the Surat Builders’ Association. 

 “The intention is to provide employment to construction workers and other labourers who come to the city. Shelter to them will increase the possibility of them getting employment in the city,” said an SMC officer. 
 
 These floating labour transit accommodation centres will double up as placement hubs for class-IV labourers. Credai and Surat Builders’ Association would be recruiting labourers directly from these centres whenever they are in need of them. This will benefit both the parties concerned. SMC had made an allocation of Rs5 crore in its budget for 2017-18 to set up these centres. Each centre will have rooms for at least 25 families and dormitories as well to accommodate single persons. Industries in Pandesara too want to set up such a centre for their varied units at Bhestan.
 
 “There will be signboards at railway stations and bus stops for the labourers. They won’t have to take shelter in open plots on arrival in the city,” another SMC officer said. 
 
 SMC will be approaching the state government for grants for the project and seek its approval too. A detailed project report (DPR) is being sent to the state government soon. 
 
 Credai’s Gujarat chairman Velji Sheta said, “We are awaiting the proposal from SMC. If this benefits the industry, we will support it.”
