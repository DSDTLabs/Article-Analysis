MUMBAI: Several   are not happy with the answer   for NEET-Undergraduate released by the CBSE on Friday. Some of them have decided to challenge the questions that they believe had more than one right answer and have not been identified by the board.

 Students and parents alleged that the paper had at least four questions with more than one correct answer and that needs to be acknowledged. The question on contraceptive Saheli’s function, the form in which iron is absorbed by plants, statements “not true” for halogens, are some of the questions, said   of medical parents’ association.
 
 Another parent, though, said that the CBSE only goes by the   textbooks and may or may not accept challenges that are from other reference materials. “Since CBSE has never officially announced the challenges they accept after the review, students should give it a try,” said a parent. 
 
 Students are expected to send their challenges in by Monday. Some of the parents plan to seek help from subject experts, too, as losing even one mark in the competitive exam could result in a major drop in their rank. The board usually gets the challenges reviewed by a team of experts and consider their decision as final.
 
 NEET-UG was held on May 6. Around 13.3 lakh students had registered for the test. Of these, 1.8 lakh were from   followed by Kerala and Uttar Pradesh. There are around 66,000 MBBS and 26,000 BDS seats in the country. While last year, the board had identified two questions in the physics section as ambiguous in the set, students had claimed that answers of two more questions given in the answer key were incorrect.
