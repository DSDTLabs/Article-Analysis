AHMEDABAD: Over 100   were allegedly apprehended and around 18 of their boats seized by   (PMSA) off Jakhau coast in  's   district, a fishermen association official said on Sunday.

 "We have learnt that more than 100 fishermen who were on board around 18 fishing boats were apprehended by PMSA near the international maritime boundary line off Jakhau coast yesterday," National Fishworkers' Forum (NFF) secretary Manish Lodhari said.
 
 "The fishermen who escaped have informed us about this," he said.
 
 The NFF is trying to establish contact with the Pakistani agencies to get the exact number of those abducted by PMSA, he said.
 
 The PMSA had earlier this month also apprehended 115 fishermen and seized 19 boats.
 
 "In March so far, the PMSA has separately held over 225 fishermen along with nearly three dozen boats," Lodhari said.
 
 The development comes after the Indian Coast Guard captured nine Pakistani nationals along with a fishing boat off Jakhau coast in Kutch on Friday.
 
 Last month, the BSF had apprehended four abandoned Pakistani fishing boats near Sir Creek in Kutch district during an extensive search operation in the area.
