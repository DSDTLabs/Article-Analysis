PANAJI: The   (NIT), Goa, will offer 60 more seats at the undergraduate level from the academic year 2018-19. 

 The institute, which had already decided to introduce the programmes of bachelors in mechanical engineering and bachelors in civil engineering from July 2018, said the intake for the programmes will be of 30 seats each.
 
 As 40% of the seats at   are reserved for Goan students, an increase in the intake will also mean that a higher number of Goa students will be able to get a seat at the institute from July this year.
 
 “We believe the institute should spread its wings in different areas of knowledge to keep up the trajectory of growth. It has already been informed to the concerned officials that when students fill up their choice at the time of admissions, post the IITJEE exams, the option of these two new programmes at NIT Goa should be provided to students accordingly,” NIT Goa director, professor   told STOI. 
 
 NIT Goa started out in 2010 by offering the three streams of electrical engineering, electronics and telecommunications engineering, and computer science engineering. Operating from its temporary campus at the   in  , since it began operations eight years ago, NIT Goa was only able to up its intake from 90 seats to 140 until last year.
 
 As per the original growth plan, the institute was to add new streams within three years of its establishment, which was by 2013. Now that the institute has received land for construction of its new campus at Cuncolim, the NIT has started implementing its expansion plans.
 
 With the addition of the two new programmes, NIT Goa will have five undergraduate and two postgraduate programmes. In addition, there are 45 research scholars working in various areas at NIT Goa.
