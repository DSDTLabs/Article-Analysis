DEHRADUN: A part of the   since 1963, four time Chief Minister Narayan Dutt Tiwari along with his son Rohit Shekhar joined the BJP in the presence of party chief Amit Shah at his Delhi residence on Wednesday.

 Tiwari started his career with the Praja   and was elected   from Nainital in 1952 and won the seat again in 1957. In 1963, Tiwari joined Congress and won the assembly election from the Kashipur constituency.
  
 The Congress stalwart was the CM of undivided Uttar Pradesh from 21 January 1976 to April 30, 1977, August 3, 1984 to September 24, 1985 and June 25, 1988 to December 5, 1989.
  
 After Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh on November 9, 2000, the Congress under his guidance won the assembly polls. Tiwari remained the CM of the state from March 2, 2002 to March 7, 2007.
