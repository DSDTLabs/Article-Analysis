NEW DELHI:   submitted a memorandum to the state   commission, alleging violation of the model   of conduct by the AAP-led Delhi government on Monday. The party requested the SEC to direct Delhi government to remove the words ‘Aam Admi’ from welfare schemes like mohalla clinics and bypass express bus services.

 On Saturday, Vijender Gupta, leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly, filed a complaint with SEC demanding strict action against the government. “The Delhi government is ruled byAAP. The party has intentionally kept the word ‘Aam Aadmi’ for it political propaganda. This has placed other political parties in disadvantageous situation in the upcoming municipal elections. This will have political advantage for  , which is against the spirit of model code of conduct,” Gupta added.
 
 BJP said that in the recent assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, the then SP government was asked to cover the word ‘Samajwadi’ on 1,488 ambulances running under “Samajwadi Swasthya Sewa” programme.
 
 In 2012 UP elections, the then BSP government was directed to cover all the statues of elephants, which is BSP’s party symbol, during elections. “When SP and BSP were directed to take necessary action to ensure a level playing field to all parties, it should be done here too,” Gupta maintained.
 
 After meeting state election commissioner S K Srivastava, Gupta said, “He informed us that he has sought an action taken report,” said Gupta.
