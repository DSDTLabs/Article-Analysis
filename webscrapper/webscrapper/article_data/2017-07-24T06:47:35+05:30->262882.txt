AHMEDABAD: After Unesco declared Ahmedabad as World Heritage City, Gujarat police have initiated a project to trace their history from its beginnings in the British Era. The project has been entrusted to   (RSU) which has already begun work with the help of historians.

 Director of RSU, additional DGP  , said the findings of the research once finished would be published. 
 
 “We have already found some administrative reports of the then Ahmedabad municipality going back to 1898. They have interesting facts about posting of police personnel, officials and their salaries,” Sahay said.
 
 Historian  , who was assigned the task by RSU, said these days private security personnel are deployed at the municipal corporation building at Gol Limda. However, in 1898 -99 a police officer of the rank of police inspector was deployed for security purposes.
 
 “At that time the salary of the inspector was Rs 25 and he was paid an additional amount of Rs 10 per month as horse allowance,” Kadri said. 
 
 “A detective was also deployed at the then municipality building to keep an eye on developments. Probably, the detective also kept watch on various activities in the building campus. He was paid a monthly salary of Rs 15,” Kadri said.
 
 Interestingly, there is also mention in the administrative report that seven educated sepoys were deployed at Saraspur Darwaza. “With a monthly salary of Rs 7, the educated sepoys were needed because at that time   could have been a tax collection centre,” Kadri said.
 
 Additional DGP Sahay said the research team will also be meeting retired police officers and their families to gather photographs for the history of Gujarat police. “We would also gather information about police stations and police chowkies which are still there, right from the British Era to the present day,” Sahay said.
