AHMEDABAD: Sushila Sharma, a 60-year-old resident of Bodakdev, died from swine flu at a private hospital near Vastrapur lake on Friday. According to data from the   (AMC), Sharma was admitted to the hospital last Monday. Civic authorities claimed Sharma was suffering from   as well.

 Sporadic cases of swine flu are still being reported across the city. The civic body reported 15 swine-flu deaths in the city from January to July and a total of 81 cases. Of these, seven cases were reported in July alone. Physicians say that the cases are often reported at a late stage, which leads to further complications.
 
 Dr Pratibha Dileep, critical care specialist at a private hospital, said, “Most cases we get at a tertiary care centre are at a later stage which further increases the risk for super-added bacterial infection. This gets the patient into ARDS stage i.e. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. At this stage, morbidity and mortality increases, especially with H1N1 infections.”
 
 “Bacterial pneumonia has a 40% mortality rate. Moreover, elderly people, those suffering from diabetes and liver disorders, are more prone to the infection,” she added.
 
 Common symptoms of swine flu include a cold and runny nose. If a patient suffers from a high grade fever, disproportionate bodyache, acidity, loose motions or indigestion, one must stay alert and consult a doctor immediately.
 
 Medical practitioners say that patients should be extra careful and should not self-medicate. “Most cases of swine flu are reported in the second or third stage and that worsens the situation. In fact, 40% of total patients are high-risk patients. Going forward, sporadic cases of swine flu will be reported. Doctors should also be vigilant and follow the government’s guidelines for treatment,” said Dr Kamlesh Upadhyay, professor of medicine at Civil Hospital.
