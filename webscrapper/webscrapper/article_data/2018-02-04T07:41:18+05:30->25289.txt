CHARMINAR: Several areas of   are not just an eyesore but also create traffic snarls due to overflowing dustbins and garbage piles lying on pavements. 

 A narrow road in the congested Ghansi Bazaar is one such example. "Many vehicles use this narrow lane to get to a cloth market in the area but the overflowing garbage bins often obstruct the traffic as there is no space for the vehicles to pass," said Mohammad Raees, a resident.
 
 A garbage collection bin lying on the main road in Mir Jumla, Moghalpura is also creating similar problems in the area. 
 
 The narrow road if often used as a short cut as it is connected to the road leading to Charminar. Ameera Begum, who resides near the road said, "The dustbin is at the corner of the road and with garbage spilling the commuters' way is blocked. This is also the reason for many health issues in the area."
 
 The residents are irked by the sight of the overflowing bins and littered roads. "We are compelled to bear the foul odour from the bin. It has also become a breeding spot for insects which poses a major health hazard," said another resident, Rakesh Kumar.
 
 When contacted a   official said that, they have been maintaining the bins and are clearing the garbage from roads on a daily basis. "We will ensure the problem is solved but it is also the people's responsibility to dispose waste properly instead of littering,"  , GHMC zonal vommissioner ( ) said.
