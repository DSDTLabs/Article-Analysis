MUMBAI: A sessions court on Tuesday rejected the discharge pleas of the cops accused in the death of   jail inmate Manjula  . 

 The court refused to grant relief to incarcerated jailor  , and guards Bindu Naikude, Waseema Shaikh, Sheetal Shegaokar, Surekha Gudve and Aarti Shingane. The crime branch had alleged that the accused had knowledge that their beating would result in Shetye's death and yet they continuously assaulted her with fists and kicked her on June 23 last year. 
 
 On June 23 the six cops allegedly kicked and punched Shetye, causing 16 contusions (as later made out by the postmortem report). The   police on June 24 registered an FIR after the report revealed that the contusions were the cause of death. After hearing the news of Shetye's death, the jail's inmates went berserk, resorting to arson.
