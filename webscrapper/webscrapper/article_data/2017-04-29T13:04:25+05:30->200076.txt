PUDUCHERRY: A 50-year-old advocate was arrested on charges of marrying a   and raping and impregnating her in the   of Puducherry. The advocate was identified as John Andrew Macfarlane, practising at the  , mostly handling motor accident cases. 
Police said the issue came to light when the management of a private hospital alerted the child welfare committee that a minor girl, who was in an advanced stage of pregnancy, had come for consultation. The committee members swung into action and rescued the girl. They recorded the statement of the girl and forwarded a complaint to higher officials, who, in turn, directed the   to undertake a detailed probe.
 
 Inquiries revealed that John was separated from his wife following a misunderstanding a few years ago and the couple, who did not have any children, was living separately since then. John met the victim, who was 17 years then, when her aunt approached him regarding a law suit. The victim was living with her aunt after the death of her parents.
 
 John convinced her aunt by making several false promises and 'married' the victim almost a year ago. The victim became pregnant and when she reached an advanced stage of pregnancy he demanded that she hand over the baby to him after birth, break their relationship and disappear. 
 
 Police said the girl and her aunt, decided to speak out after learning the advocate's plans. Police booked a case against him and arrested him. They produced him before a local court that remanded him in judicial custody. The committee shifted the girl to a recognized home after medical tests.
