A guy who once gorged on twenty-two chapatis a day is now a two time   winner and a two time Mr  , besides having many other accolades to his credit. Khemendra suffered a severe knee injury in 2015 but instead of deterring him, the injury only fuelled his journey towards being fitter. Now, he not only has washboard abs but invincible   too. We got him to share his diet and workout that helped him sculpt his dream body.

  I have been into gymming since 2009 but the turning point came in 2015. Around the beginning of the year, I met with an accident while doing a squat with 180 kilo weight. It gave me a severe knee injury. So, I had to leave gymming for almost a year. I got back to it with a fresh start in 2016 and the same year in March, I won Fitness Model Delhi. It inspired me and got me back on track and much ahead.

  Transformation doesnâ€™t happen in a day. It is slow and steady and step by step. You need to toil for it and work hard over a long period of time.
 
  
  
 
  
 Whenever I look at myself in the mirror, I see my flaws and the body areas that need more toning. The desire to tone them keeps me driven.
 
  
 I have achieved my body with a lot of hard work and clean eating. When one takes the steroid shortcut, his body suffers as it may develop bad spots and pimples. I have followed the organic way and 10 years down the line, I see myself as fitter version of what I am right now.
 
 
 Before I got into fitness, I used to have 22 chapatis a day. I was overweight. The biggest lifestyle modification was made by me in cutting down majorly on carbs and junk food. Also, I increased my water intake and now I drink 16 litres of water a day.
 
 
 When I injured my knee in 2015. Staying off exercise for so long was really hard. 
 
 
 Never give up. Toning your body takes efforts, months and years. You have to be determined to keep going.
