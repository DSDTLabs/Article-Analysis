Visakhapatnam: No chief minister in the country understands Information Technology (IT) better than me, said state chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu.

 While conversating with representatives from Conduent India at the inauguration of its nineth office at Rushikonda IT hills here on Thursday, the chief minister stated that he is a strong believer of IT, and the present status of IT in Hyderabad is an instance of it. 
 
 Naidu said that when he was in power it took him nine years to shape the IT sector in Hyderabad. He urged companies to believe in him, and set up IT and IT-enabled firms in Andhra Pradesh and Visakhapatnam. 
 
 The government is ready to sanction all kind of incentives for those interested in setting up their companies in the state, Naidu assured. He further appealed to Conduent India representatives, including vice president Subhash Sharma, to ensure that the company recruits more than 50% of its workforce from Andhra Pradesh. Naidu said that the company’s new office in Visakhapatnam is poised to created 5,000 jobs in the city over the next two years.
 
 Later, the chief minister visited the Tech Mahindra office at Satyam Junction on the highway road, where he inaugurated the development centre of Franklin Templeton Investments, set up in collaboration with technology services company Innova Solutions.
 
 On the occasion, Naidu praised the president and COO of Franklin Templeton Investments Jenny Johnson and spoke of their association that goes back to the time when he was the chief minister of united Andhra Pradesh.
 
 Discussing the firm’s plans, Johnson said, “Technology is the cornerstone on which the global asset management industry will evolve, and we at Franklin Templeton wish to be at the forefront of this evolution to enhance business and investment outcomes for our stakeholders. We see significant potential in Visakhapatnam and are delighted to tap into its excellent infrastructure and large talent pool.”
