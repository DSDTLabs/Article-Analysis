Coimbatore: A 27-year-old man was arrested for murdering his ex-lover who demanded Rs 1 lakh from him and threatened to reveal their relationship to his family members and others at Othakkalmandapam here on Thursday. 

 The arrested was identified as Balakrishnan, 27 of Othakkalmandapam. He was employed with a pressure cooker manufacturing unit.
 
 On Tuesday early morning, V Revathi, 32, of Kallatti in Nilgiris was found dead in a house at Arisipalayam near Othakkalmandapam. Police said she was first married to Vijayaraj, 40, of Queen Shola in Nilgiris, and the couple has a son and a daughter. 
 
 Revathi lived with her husband in a rental house belonging to Balakrishnan with whom she developed an affair. As she often asked money from him, Balakrishnan ended the affair. 
 
 Revathi, meanwhile, separated from her husband in June and fell for Santhosh, a call taxi driver from Chettipalayam. Both of them rented a house at Arisipalayam and got married two weeks ago. Last week, Revathi met Balakrishnan and demanded Rs 1 lakh. When she threatened him, he entered Revathiâ€™s house at Arisipalayam and hacked her to death.
