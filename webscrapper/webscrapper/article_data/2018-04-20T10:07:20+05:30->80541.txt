THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Light fishing in territorial waters (within 12 nautical miles from the coast) using lights with power above 12 watts will soon be a punishable offence in the state. The department of fisheries has formulated a new set of rules to strictly control destructive fishing practices, including regulations on light fishing, a widely followed method for fishing in the state. The rules have been formulated based on Kerala Marine Fishing Regulation Act (KMFRA) 2017. The Act has included new clauses dealing with use of dynamite, other explosive substance, poison or noxious chemicals, light or other destructive materials to catch or destroy the   in the specified area.

 
 An official said that specific rules making destructive fishing practices a culpable offence were being mooted for the first time in the state .
 
 Mechanised vessels equipped with fixed type LED lights and even submersible lights employ light fishing method which leads to phototaxis, in which fishes get attracted to sources of light. “Usually smaller fishes which are preys to larger ones get attracted to light first and larger fishes follow smaller fishes and the fishermen catch the entire stock,” an official said. Use of dynamite and fish toxins like copper sulphate for fishing would also invite legal action.
 
 The officials said regulations have been mooted to check fish aggregate devices in which fishes are trapped and caught using natural substances and sometimes plastic bottles. T  , president of the  , while welcoming new rules, said that success of such measures depend on enforcement.
