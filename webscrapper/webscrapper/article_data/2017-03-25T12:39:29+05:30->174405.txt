Actress   thinks she was 'immature' until she had a baby of her own because being a child star made her feel special. 

 The 37-year-old actress began her career when she was just eight years old, and she says she didn't really grow up until she and husband   welcomed their son   into the world in August 2014. 
 
  
  
 "Marriage shows you your flaws in how you deal with things, and having a child forces you to grow up at the speed of light. I'm a completely different person than I was before I had my child," she says. 
 
 "Because I was so celebrated for being a child, I think I held onto that immaturity for a very long time. It was the thing that made me special. Then at a certain point, like 35, it's not so special to be immature." she added.
