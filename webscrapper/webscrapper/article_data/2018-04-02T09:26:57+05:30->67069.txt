BENGALURU: Passengers at various Metro stations have been complaining about   to swipe smart cards or drop tokens.

  Every day, an average of 3.5 lakh passengers take the Metro. While 1.8 lakh people travel on Purple Line, 1.6 lakh take the Green Line. Passenger traffic is increasing by the day, with the spike noticeable during rain and peak hours. 
 
 Ratnakar Shetty, a Metro commuter, on Wednesday tweeted a picture of a long queue at the exit gate of Yelachenahalli station. “This photo has only half the line, but behind me 100s are waiting. Please increase the number of exit counters and repair the one which is not working for last 10 days,” tweeted Shetty.
 
 “There are three counters and one is not working for 10 days. Why can’t this be fixed? Also, as a long-term solution, why can’t BMRCL increase the number of counters to four or five like at many other stations where exit is very smooth,” asked Shetty.
 
 Passengers criss-crossing major stations like Majestic Interchange, Byappanahalli, Indiranagar, Mysuru Road, and Magadi Road are the most affected. “We’ve to stand in long queues, especially during peak hours because of few exit and entry gates at Majestic Interchange,” said S Krishnakumar, another passenger.
 
 ‘Gates can’t be increased’
 
  “The number of exit gates at stations cannot be increased due to security reasons. However, repairs works will be completed in a couple of days,” said U A Vasanth Rao, chief public relations officer, BMRCL.
 
 “Long lines are common during rush hours across the world. But the lines moves fast, as the security is well equipped to handle the crowd. It is to the credit of the commuters of   that there is self-discipline in line formation, an example that many countries lack,” he added.
