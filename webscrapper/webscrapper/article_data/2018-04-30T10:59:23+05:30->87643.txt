But Sonia not only took it courageously, she also changed her personality. She became very positive about life and even started her own company,” said Dr Venkataramana, who is now chief neurosurgeon at Brains Hospital.

 Sonia, who was earlier an airhostess, is now a motivational speaker and entrepreneur.
