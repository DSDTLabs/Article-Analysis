   , who lives in the next building, said they saw the flames around 6am and alerted others. "I wake up early every day; I was standing outside when I heard loud noises from the hospital. I saw fire sparks from the window," he said. 
 
  Without wasting time, Ataulla and hospital staff made arrangements to shift the patients. "By then, fire tenders arrived and with police help, we took patients in an ambulance to Ramakrishna Nursing Home," Ramesh Gowda, auto driver from Guttalli, said. 
 
  Fire personnel broke open the windows to let the clogged smoke out and poured water on the flammable material inside the laboratory. Dr Keshavamurthy, head of Bilva Hospital, said the patients were being treated for minor ailments and there was no issue either in shifting them or continuing their treatment in another hospital.
