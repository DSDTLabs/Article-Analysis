DEHRADUN: The stigma around mental health issues needs to end, say psychologists in Dehradun adding that many college and school students in the city were grappling with   and should be helped. A group of citizens, including psychologists at   (GDMCH), has created a song 'Depression ko door bhagao' to raise awareness on the issue. The song will be launched on World Health Day on Friday which has 'Depression' as its theme this year. 

 Dr   , a city-based neuro-psychologist and a   designated counsellor, said, " My colleagues from the biochemistry department at GDMCH and I have created the song to generate discussion on the subject of depression. A college student has played the guitar to make the music more contemporary. We will share the song with schools and colleges." 
 
 Kaushal said that the taboo around depression needs to end, especially since youngsters were vulnerable to it. She added, ""If I receive 50 calls in a day from students who seek counselling, approximately 35 to 40 of them are depressed or anxious." 
 
 Another city-based psychologist,  , said, "Depression can only be tackled once there is more awareness about the topic. If a youth is close to family and friends and shares his or her concerns with them, there are high chances of combating depression before it becomes chronic."
