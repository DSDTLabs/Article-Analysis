KOLHAPUR: The district education department has received a response of 1,230 online applications from the parents for the   (RTE) admission process by March 2, which was the last day of the application process for parents, for the reserved seats in   across the city and district.

 Subhash Chougule, education officer (primary), told TOI that the extended period proved to be a boon for the online applications, which has resulted in almost double the applications, compared to last year.
 
 “We have received 808 applications for the RTE across the district, while for the city based private eligible schools, we have received 422 applications. As of now, we have not received any more extension instruction,” he said.
 
 Chougule added that the first draw of the admissions will be drawn on March 7, across selected schools, which have received the higher response than the given seats.
