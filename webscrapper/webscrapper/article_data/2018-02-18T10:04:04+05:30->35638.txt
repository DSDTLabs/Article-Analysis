AGRA: Elaborate security arrangements have been made in the city as   Justin Trudeau, who landed in India with his family for a week-long visit on Saturday, is slated to visit the   on Sunday. However, chief minister Yogi Adityanath or any other minister from his cabinet will not be there to receive him -- with all the protocol duties being left to the district magistrate Gaurav Dayal and Agra commissioner  .
 
  Traffic restrictions are likely to be imposed on the route that the Canadian PM takes to the Taj. “As of now, there is no information of any UP minister coming to receive Trudeau. The DM and the commissioner will, however, be present,” said additional district magistrate (protocol) Kanchan Saran. The ASI has decided to shut the Taj Mahal to the general public between 9:40 am and 11:40 am today during Trudeau’s visit.
  
  Trudeau, along with wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau and three children, is expected to spend over one hour at the Taj, accompanied by a delegation of Canadian officials and the media. Trudeau will reach Kheria airbase by a special royal Canadian Air Force plane at 9:50 am. He will travel to the Shilpgram by road and will subsequently be shown around the Taj in golf carts.
  
  The Trudeaus will also get themselves clicked on the iconic Diana bench. According to ASI officials, three guides, Nitin Singh, Tarun Jain and Ramesh Diwan will be deputed with the Trudeau family and their delegation.
  
  On January 15, Israeli Prime Minister   and wife Sara had visited the Taj. The chief minister had then received the couple and taken them around the world heritage site.
