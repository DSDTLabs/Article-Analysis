HYDERABAD: At a time when sexual assault against children is increasing significantly, the Telangana Crime Investigation Department (CID) said exposure to internet was making them easy targets of sexual predators.

 In 2016, 819 sexual assault on children were recorded against 671cases in 2015 across Telangana. So far 84 cases have been reported in 2017, under Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), which CID officials say is a matter of grave concern.
 
 A two-day conference organised by CID in coordination with Tulir-Centre for the Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse, an organization based in Chennai threw light on online child abuse. Officials said the conference on prevention of “Online Child Sexual Abuse“ was meant to sensitise police officers, media, educators and NGOs. “Because of their imma turity and inexperience, children are vulnerable and easy target for sexual predators. Games, social media like Facebook and chat rooms enable people to make contact with children. The predators can create false onli ne identities and trick the children into chatting and sharing sexual images over web cam,“ Inspector General of Police (CID)   said at the conference. “Once they have image of video they use it to blackmail the child and obtain further images. This starts as a vicious circle of abuse,“ she added, making a reference about the recent arrest of an American national from whom 29,000 porn videos and images of children were recovered.
 
 Stuti Kacker, Chairperson of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said that in the last one year of the 3,000 complaints received by the commission Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) related cases stood third in the maximum number of cases received. “The online predators from USA, UK & Europe are preying on children located elsewhere and there is a need to be vigilant,“ she added.
