HYDERABAD: Almost a month has gone by since a building collapsed in the Nanakramguda area. However,   ( ) officials continue to ponder over the cause behind the building collapse. 

  GHMC had asked experts from the JNTU to file a report which could have elucidated the reasons for the collapse by December 31. However, that has not happened.. Days after the collapse, the expert group from JNTU had sent in a preliminary report on the collapse, which squarely laid the blame on improper structural planning. 
 
  The latest report that was meant to be given to the civic authorities was a report on the quality of the building material. "The report was supposed to reach us last month, but there has been delay in the matter. Not just that we have also asked the group to identify and survey the neighbouring buildings for lapses in construction. But, until that report reaches us, we cannot take any action,"  , chief city planner, GHMC said. 
 
  With civic authorities pinning the blame on the JNTU group for their lack of action, professor N V   is hopeful that the report will reach GHMC by Wednesday morning. "We have sent some material that we collected from the site for testing. The report should reach GHMC by Wednesday," he said. While refusing to divulge details of the report, all he said was that there were several defects in the building's construction. 
 
  "The design of the building was inadequate, there was too much load that was put on the building's existing pillars," said Rao. It might be recalled, that the mishap took place at an under construction G+6 storey building, where painting and flooring work was being done. 
 
  The building owned by   was being constructed in a 250 square yards plot at the heart of Nanakramguda. Ffamilies of construction workers and a watchman were staying in the building, said neighbours.
