HYDERABAD: Exactly a year after 10-year-old Ramya's death in a horrific car crash on   No 3 numbed Hyderabad, the city witnessed a re-run of the tragedy on Tuesday -barely a km from the 2016 accident site.

 Only, this time, the victim was an   behind the wheel, Fasahat Ali, and not an unsuspecting traveller in her uncle's car.
 
 “It immediately brought back memories of last year's accident. Just like then, on Tuesday too, the car hit the divider on the right, flipped to the other side of the road and crashed. This time, it didn't land on another car,“ said a pedestrian who was only metres away from the spot when the accident occurred. “It all happened in a matter seconds. One second, I saw the car in the air and the next second it had toppled over on its roof. By the time I got there, a crowd had gathered around the site and people were trying to turn the car around. All I could see was blood splattered all over,“ the passer-by said.
 
 The eye-witness, a security guard at a restaurant in the area, was jolted by a loud thud. “I was inside when I heard the sound. I rushed out and saw the melee, and immediately knew something frightful had happened. It was a gory sight. The boy who died, his head was smashed. There was another lying at a distance writhing in pain.Though I couldn't see the third one, I just pray at least the two of them are safe,“ the guard said, disturbed by what he had witnessed minutes ago.
 
 Two others in the car suffered cuts and bruises but didn't appear critical. “I think one among them, perhaps sitting in the rear, was thrown out of the car because of the impact.That must have saved his life,“ said another commuter. The image of a battered young life and the nauseating stench of blood will not leave them soon.
