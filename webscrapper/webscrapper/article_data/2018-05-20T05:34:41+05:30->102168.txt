BIJNOR: Following the complaint of the family of a 13-year-old girl, police have registered a case of sexual harassment against a 62-year-old man at   station. The girl’s family has alleged that the accused raped their daughter when she was alone at home. On Saturday, the complainants met   SP   and demanded that a case of rape should be filed against the accused.
 
 Officials said that the incident took place in Bhauwala village under Badhapur police station on Friday afternoon. “We were in our agricultural field and my daughter was alone at home. That was when Begraj Singh from Jamalpur Dhikali village came to our house and raped her. When she resisted, he assaulted her,” the girl’s mother said.
  
  “The family approached me on Saturday. I have ordered Badhapur police to register a case of rape against the accused. The girl has been sent to the district hospital for medical examination,” the SP said.
  
  Dharampal Singh, Badhapur station house officer, said, “The girl’s family had filed a complaint of harassment against the accused on Friday. However, on Saturday, they suddenly changed their version and alleged that their daughter was raped. They did not contact me and gave their complaint to a sub-inspector. Police will register a fresh case based on their new complaint. We are also waiting for the medical report of the girl.”
