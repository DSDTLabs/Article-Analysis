It is turning out to be a great night for   Kendrick Lamar as he picked up his fifth trophy-Best Rap Album-at this year's Grammys.

  The   hitmaker beat out  's '4:44' for the honour, which was presented by funnyman  .
 
  
  
 
  During his acceptance speech, the rapper said, "From the jump I thought it was about the accolades and cars and clothes but it is really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve, for the next listener, the next generation after, that you know what I'm saying?"
 
 ''Hip-hop has done that for me'', added Lamar.
 
  
  
 
  The rapper concluded his speech with a shout-out to eight-time 2018 nominee JAY-Z. Right before exiting the stage, Lamar shouted, "Jay-Z for president!"
 
  JAY-Z acknowledged the rapper by giving a standing ovation to Lamar for his win.
 
  For the second year in a row, James Corden is hosting the music's biggest night.
 
  For the 60th annual show, the party moved from its home base of the Staples Center in Los Angeles to Madison Square Garden in New York City.
