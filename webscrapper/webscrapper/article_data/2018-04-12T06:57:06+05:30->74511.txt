NEW DELHI: India will reverse two years of slowing growth as the economy is set to expand by 7.3% in 2018-19 and 7.6% in 2019-20 on the back of a string of growth-oriented policy measures, according to a report by   ( ).

 
 India will continue to retain its position as the fastest growing major economy in the world as China is projected to grow by 6.6% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2019, following 6.9% expansion in 2017.
 
 ADB forecasts   growth in Asia and the Pacific to reach 6% in 2018 and 5.9% in 2019, a slight deceleration from the 6.1% registered in 2017.
 
 
  
 
 It said risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, driven primarily by fears of escalating trade tensions. Recent US tariffs on select products have not yet dented trade, but further actions by the US and counter actions against them could undermine business and consumer confidence in Asia and the Pacific, it said.
 
 In its latest Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2018 report, ADB noted that the dip in growth to 6.6% in FY2017 in Indian was driven in part by lingering effects of demonetization, which impacted the informal sector in the first half of FY2017. Teething issues related to implementation of GST, which hampered operations of small and medium-sized enterprises and exporters, also contributed to growth moderation.
 
 “Despite the short-term costs, the benefits of reform — such as GST — will propel India’s future growth,” said Yasuyuki Sawada, ADB’s chief economist.
