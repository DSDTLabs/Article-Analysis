MUSSORIE: American President   followed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s style and used similar slogans to ensure a win in the US Presidential elections,   Ganesh Joshi said in a rally on Tuesday.
 
  “Trump used PM Modi-style talk with the slogan Ab ki baar, Trump Sarkar that changed things for him,” said Joshi. Trump was seen in a TV campaign ad saying ‘Ab Ki Baar Trump Sarkar’ apparently in a bid to woo Indian-Americans. Joshi also said that he was framed in the Shaktiman case.
  
  “I have been a soldier and served the nation. I have been to jail twice. My hands were broken during the Uttarakhand agitation but that didn’t hurt, what hurt this time was the fact that I was framed. I was in jail for four days in miserable conditions with no water to even bathe,” Joshi said. Shaktiman, a white police horse was injured during a BJP protest in Dehradun led by Joshi on March 14. The MLA had to go to jail for allegedly assaulting the horse. The horse died later.
  
  Health minister J P Nadda, who was also present at the rally, said that under Congress leadership Uttarakhand has become a backward state riddled with corruption while those under BJP regime had done better. He added, “Isn’t this the Mussoorie where people were shot dead during the agitation for statehood? Wasn’t the now CM (Harish Rawat) then rallying behind Narsimha Rao while Ganesh Joshi was agitating with others for statehood? It was Vajpayee ji (Atal Bihari Vajpayee) who took the decision to form Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh.”
