However, it will be the responsibility of the district administration to ascertain the next kin of the deceased," beneficiaries' petitioner Samit Kumar Carr said, reading out the letter which he received on Thursday.
 
 The order came after the NHRC found merits in the claims made by petitioners, who challenged the state government's decision to not disburse funds to silicosis victims. The next of kin of the three victims, Mono Karmakar, Chinta Karmakar and Ram Bagal, were refused compensation after failing to provide succession certificates. All the victims are residents of Dumaria and Musaboni blocks. On the fresh directive issued by NHRC, an official in the department of the factories said, "We are looking into the case and are awaiting orders from top authorities."
