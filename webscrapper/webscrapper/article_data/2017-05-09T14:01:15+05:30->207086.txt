PANAJI: A Chella Kumar, the newly appointed desk in-charge of   in Goa, will hold a joint meeting with the party MLAs, block presidents and other executive members on Tuesday. The meeting is likely to focus on ongoing preparations for the coming panchayat elections.

 “Chella Kumar is arriving on Tuesday and we are meeting at 4pm at Congress house. There are several things to discuss but yes, the panchayat poll preparations will be reviewed. There are other issues as well,”   president and opposition leader Chandrakant   said.
 
 After the fiasco with government formation post the state assembly elections, Goa desk in-charge   was relieved of his responsibilities. Kavlekar said that though the panchayat elections were not being held on party lines, the party would back “secular” candidates. “Our preparations for the panchayat elections are progressing smoothly and in earnest,” Kavlekar said.
 
 The opposition leader said that though the party was geared for the by-polls, preparations would commence only after chief minister   formally resigns from the Rajya Sabha and after a sitting MLA in Goa vacates his post for the CM to contest from. “It is too early to talk about bye-polls. One seat is still not clear,” he said.
