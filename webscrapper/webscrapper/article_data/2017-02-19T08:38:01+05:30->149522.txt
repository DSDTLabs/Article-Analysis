TRICHY: Corporation officials along with city traffic police wing conducted an   on encroachments that had come up along   street in the city on Saturday. Traders were warned to clear all encroachments that had cropped up in front of shops within 15 days.

 Following various complaints from motorists and general public in the city, corporation officials took up the eviction drive in the cityâ€™s main commercial area. Corporation officials and police personnel went there and instructed the respective traders to remove the encroachments on their own. Corporation staff will execute the process starting from Gandhi Market arc to the foot hills of Rockfort. 
 
 According to officials, there are more than 500 outlets and big commercial establishments along the stretch. Most of these outlets had extended their shops by five to ten feet, eating into road space and hampering smooth flow of traffic. Indiscriminate use of public space for parking also adds to the woes of motorists and pedestrians using the stretch.
 
 To avert traffic snarls along the road, police have planned to use both sides alternatively. As per the plan, parking should be made along the left side for the first 15 days of the month and the right side for the rest of the days. 
 
 Moreover, traffic police have been asked to follow one way traffic along the road as vehicles are only allowed to ply towards Rockfort from market entrance. No violations should be allowed in future, police officials said. 
 
 During the process, deputy commissioner of police Prabakaran, assistant commissioners Murugesan and  , city corporation zonal assistant commissioner Rengaraj were also present.
