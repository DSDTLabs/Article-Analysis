Kolkata:   of ‘1946 Calcutta Killings’ Milan Bhowmik, on Wednesday, sent a letter (a copy of which is with TOI) to the regional officer of the Central Board of Film Certification threatening to commit suicide if his certification problems are not sorted out within the next seven days.

 His film, starring Gajendra Chauhan as Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, has not been cleared even after revisiting and resubmitting it as asked by the Film Certificate Appellate Tribunal in May. The tribunal chairperson Justice Manmohan Sarin, had instructed the board to decide on the fate of the film that allegedly portrays Jawaharlal Nehru in a negative light, within 15 days of resubmission. 
 
 “I have not heard anything on the status of my film and am on the brink of an economic disaster. My sponsors are chasing me. This has ruined my family life,” Bhowmik said. His   said: “I have no option but to commit suicide and the full responsibility will go to CBFC for its negligence.” Board sources, however, said the letter hasn’t reached the office. tnn
