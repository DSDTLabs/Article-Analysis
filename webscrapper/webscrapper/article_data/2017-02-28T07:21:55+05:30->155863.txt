Ahmedabad: There was a ruckus in the state assembly over references by the Congress and the BJP to the   murder and the Godhra carnage.

 Controversial statement by members of the Congress and BJP during a discussion on the recent discovery of bombs in Rajkot and the arrest of alleged ISIS suspects caused the uproar in the house. The opposition Congress spoke about Haren Pandya’s death, while minister of state Pradipsinh Jadeja brought up the burning of the S-6 coach of Sabarmati Express at Godhra.
 
 During the discussion,   Raghavji Patel said the law and order situation in the state was deteriorating. In response, minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja alleged that the Congress was protecting criminals.
 
 This brought the Congress leaders to their feet in indignation. Shaktisinh Gohil, senior Congress MLA spoke of how a BJP minister was charged with rioting. He said the government had failed to arrest the killers of Haren Pandya. He alleged that Pandya’s father had made several representations for action against certain politicians over the murder of his son.
 
 Jadeja later remarked about Monday being the anniversary of the Godhra carnage. The speaker intervened and asked him to refer to recent incidents only. In his reply, Jadeja stated that after the discovery of bombs, the government had installed 11 cameras at District Panchayat Circle and at Race Course Ring Road to keep vigil. He said that Rs 35 crore had been allocated for CCTV cameras in Rajkot.
 
 Replying to whether the government wanted a probe by the National Investigation Agency, Jadeja said his police, including the ATS, was vigilant and their efforts led to the arrest of the two individuals allegedly linked to ISIS and the apprehension of sharpshooters who were allegedly trying to kill a Jamnagar businessman.
