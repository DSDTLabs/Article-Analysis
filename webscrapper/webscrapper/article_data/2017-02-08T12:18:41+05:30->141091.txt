Subhash Kapoor’s   Kumar-starrer '  2', a sequel to 'Jolly LLB' (Winner of National Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi), promises to be an entertaining as well as a thought-provoking film. 
A screening of the satire was held on Sunday evening for a special set of invitees and they were all praises for it. The director says, “It’s encouraging. Compliments are always welcome and I’m happy with the response. We’re now keeping our fingers crossed for the Friday verdict from the audience.”
 
 Akshay’s recent movies — 'Rustom', 'Airlift', 'Baby' and 'Special 26' — have blended entertainment with a strong story-line, thus giving the audience something to ponder over. 'Jolly LLB 2', which has the action hero playing a lawyer for the first time, is believed to be in the same space. “I’d let the audience decide how different this movie is from other Akshay outings. My work strings together a strong story-line, an ounce of entertainment, a generous serving of drama and a core thought. I agree with Akshay that the film is 35 per cent satire and the rest, an engrossing courtroom drama. He has worked extremely hard on this project,” beams Subhash.
 
 'Jolly LLB' was inspired by a hit-and-run case that made headlines throughout its trial. The sequel, however, draws from several real-life incidents, which have been woven into a single story. “I met and interacted with a lot of people while writing this film. I also read many news reports, which I’ve tried to reflect upon through this movie. Together, those stories have added a lot of punch to the narrative. Let’s hope it gets across to the audience as well,” sums up the filmmaker.
