MUMBAI: Residents woke up to much better air quality and clear skies on Friday. Also, there was a further dip in minimum temperatures. 

 On Friday, the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 175 which falls in the ‘moderate’ category as compared to 268 a day ago which is in the ‘poor’ category. 
 
 The drop on Friday was significant as compared to the past few days when the city was enveloped in haze and visibility had reduced too.
 
 An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered moderate and may be a health concern for people sensitive to air pollution. On Friday morning, the minimum temperature recorded by the   Santa Cruz observatory was 16.7 degrees Celsius which was 0.5 degree Celsius below normal, while the Colaba observatory logged 20 degrees Celsius, which was 0.6 degree Celsius below normal. 
 
 KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general (western region), IMD said the cloud cover had moved away. 
 
 “Besides, there was no wind movement at all owing to which dust particles remained suspended. This also ended up making visibility low. However, now with clear skies, temperatures have started to dip,” said Hosalikar. Maximum temperatures also continued to hover around 30 degrees Celsius.
