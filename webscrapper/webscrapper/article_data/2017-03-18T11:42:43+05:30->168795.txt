SALEM: Traders and hoteliers in the region have again started charging customers extra for point of sale (PoS) machine transactions.

 This is to compensate the merchant discount rate (MDR) deducted by their banks, traders say. “The banks, which have installed the machines at out establishments, have started deducting MDR from our accounts. Due to this, we have started charging the deduced amount from customers,” said K Vasudevan, a Salem-based hotelier.
 
 Currently, most of them are charging as much as 2% extra from the customers, who pay using debit and credit cards. However, the rate differs from bank to bank. For example, nationalised banks deduct 0.25% tax for customers paying less than Rs 1,000. Similarly, 0.50% is deducted if the sale amount is between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,000. As much as 1% is deducted if the amount exceeds Rs 2,000.
 
 “Due to demonetisation, the   (RBI) had ordered the banks not to deduct 0.25% and 0.50% charge for PoS transactions up to March 31,” said a senior manager from a nationalised bank.
 
 Meanwhile, traders and hoteliers here have started deducting service charge from customers, ignoring the RBI rules.
 
 Many traders refuse to install PoS machines in their shops only because of MDR, said K Vasu Srinivasan, district president of the Mobile Phone Dealers’ Association in Namakkal district. “Customers argue with shop owners when they charge extra for swiping cards,” he said. Both customers and traders will be happy if the banks waive the charge, he added. 
 
 Meanwhile, Poomozhi, state president of   (TMUK), alleged that some traders are charging as much as 4% of the bill amount even for small transactions.
 
 State secretary of the   (BEAI) SA Rajendran hoped that RBI will soon come out with clear instructions over the issue. “Ultimately, it is the customer who is affected by this. The apex band should do the right thing to lift this burden,” he said.
