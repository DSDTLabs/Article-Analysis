PATIALA: Accusing AAP’s local leaders of instigating schoolchildren to bring down a wall around a garbage dump near Patiala’s  , the town’s municipal commissioner on Friday wrote a letter to the deputy commissioner and senior superintendent of police (SSP) to get a case registered against the sector coordinator (urban) of the party and a former councillor who is now associated with AAP.

 The letter was sent hours after the schoolchildren pulled down the wall of the dump, after a dharna by AAP leaders who were demanding that the dump be shifted. Sarabjit Singh, AAP’s sector coordinator and a close aide of AAP’s candidate Dr Balbir Singh; and former councillor   were present on the spor.
 
 Soon after, Patiala municipal commissioner   reached the spot and got into a heated exchange of words with the AAP leaders. Following this, he shot a letter to the DC and the SSP for registration of criminal case against Sarabjit and Inderjit singh.
 
 Sarabjit Singh said the dump had become a social problem and they had been demanding that it be shifted. “It is located on a private property and the MC has no right to use it as garbage dump,” he claimed.
 
 However, Municipal commisisoner Gurpal Chahal said it was quite unbecoming of AAP leaders to instigate schoolchildren to demolish walls on government property. “The dump has been here for 20 years; it is on government land. No one has a right to demolish any structure owned by the government,” the municipal commissioner said. “They cannot take law into their hands. What kind of an example are they trying to set for schoolchildren?”
 
 Though no case had been registered against the AAP leaders till the filing of this report, police maintained that they have received a complaint and the matter was being looked into.
