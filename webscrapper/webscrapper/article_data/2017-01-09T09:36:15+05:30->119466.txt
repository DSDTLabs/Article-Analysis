Are all those sinful delights you indulged in over Christmas and New Year’s Eve making you guilty? Well, at least you can take solace in the fact that you’re the only one. Many city folk have been frowning at their enhanced waistlines following all the merrymaking.
“Gyms fill up in January, as optimistic people resolve to get in shape — all, for real, this time. We have seen a lot of clients take membership in the first 2-3 days of January. In fact, we have already completed half of our monthly targets in just those days. Apart from the fact that getting fit is on most people’s New Year resolution, what also attracts memberships is the many offers that gyms have at this time of the year. One trend I have noticed is that most clients opt for memberships of longer durations, such as yearly packages, during this period. But I can give it to you in writing that they won’t come regularly. So, although it is good for the gym, I would advise people to take memberships of smaller durations and re-evaluate their goal every trimester or so,” says  , a trainer at F45.
  of   adds, “We saw 47% more membership than December this year. Most of them have opted for non-traditional means of fitness, such as Mixed Martial Arts, Body Pump Training, and  . However, if we take a look at the trend, 80% people will not stick to their training by March, and will completely stop coming by August. At the end of the year, only 20% will end up renewing their membership.”
 However, the New Year’s rush to the gym can last longer than a month, with traffic getting even heavier in later months. “The entire first quarter of the year is a busy time for health clubs,” says Amaresh.
 Another trend that some gyms have noticed is that although there is a spurt in memberships, the number of people who actually go to the gym is reduced.   of A3 Performance says, “I mostly had couples register in late December, but they said that they would join only once they return from their holiday. There are two categories of people — those who have regained a few kilos, and others who have been wanting to lose weight, but have been postponing it because of the festivities. They join the gym at this time to get fit in time for summer, when they can’t hide behind baggy cardigans.” She adds that they achieve this as one tends to eat judiciously while exercising since they are more conscious about their bodies.
  of Ashmayu Yoga has been seeing fresh enquiries, and older members are also resuming classes. “Many people, who were off on holidays, are coming back. There are also many new members, who want to start the New Year afresh and fulfill their resolution to be fitter in 2017.”
 
 Tips to get back in shape:
 - Stop eating out as often as you did during the festive season
 - Eat at least two home-cooked meals a day
 - Control your oil and salt intake
 - Reduce alcohol consumption
 - If you are going out partying, have dinner at home before heading out
 - Visit the gym regularly. If time is a constraint, squeeze in at least half an hour a day
