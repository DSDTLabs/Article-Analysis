PATNA: The   court on Wednesday rejected the   of six Bihar   (BSSC)  . They were Gujarat-based BSSC question booklet printer Vinit Kumar, former BSSC chairman and suspended IAS official Sudhir Kumar’s nephew Arun Kumar, Arun’s friend Sajjad Ahmed, BSSC’s data entry operator Avinash Kumar, tout Vipin Kumar and courier Ajay Singh.

 Earlier on April 4, the same court of special vigilance judge Madhukar Kumar had rejected the bail petitions of Sudhir Kumar, his sister-in-law Manju Kumari and AVN School IT manager Mukesh Kumar.
 
 Special vigilance public prosecutors Vijay Kumar Sinha and Anandi Singh said Vipin, along with his two other associates, was arrested on February 4 from Bhootnath Road in Patna. They were involved in leaking BSSC question papers with the help of Avinash.
 
 “Avinash, who was linked to tout Vipin and his gang, had admitted in his confessional statement that former BSSC secretary Parmeshwar Ram was ready to leak question papers after accepting hefty sum from him,” the PPs said, adding that technical investigation of Avinash’s cellphone also ascertained that he was constantly in touch with the secretary and the touts.
 
 They also said Avinash, Vinit and Ajay were also in touch with Delhi-based evaluator Anant Preet Singh Barar with whom they had planned to lure candidates for providing jobs after taking money while Sajjad was also involved in supplying questions to other touts. 
 
 The PPs also said Arun had admitted that the questions provided by Sudhir at Hazaribagh had matched with those asked in the examination on January 29. Arun was a candidate and technical investigations proved he was at Hazaribagh on January 24.
 
 They said the bail petitions of four other accused would come up for hearing on Thursday.
