Surat: Two women were booked in Dindoli police station on Thursday for alleged cheating a 37-year-old textile trader of Rs 4.67 lakh.  One of the accused woman first developed friendship with the trader over Facebook and later duped him. Donna Dollar and Noor Saba were booked by Dindoli police following a complaint lodged by Pawan Shukla, who runs a textile shop in Aadarsh II market on the Ring Road.  In October 2017, Shukla became friends with Dollar on Facebook. She informed Shukla that she was from Los Angeles in US and into garment business. She wanted to make purchases from Surat since the textile products were cheaper here compared to other markets.  She told Shukla that she will come to India to purchase textile products in sometime. In November 2017, Dollar informed Shukla that she was coming to Delhi and after arriving at the airport she will meet him. Shukla was present in New Delhi on that day.  Later, in the day, Shukla received a phone call and the woman introduced herself as customs officer Noor Saba. She told Shukla that Dollar had been detained since she was carrying cash in US dollars more than the permissible limit. She asked Shukla to pay Rs 85,000 fine on behalf of Dollar in Indian rupees.  Believing the caller, Shukla got the money transferred through his bank in the account number given by Saba. In next couple of days, Saba asked Shukla to pay more fine giving different reasons. After paying Rs 4.67 lakh, Shukla got suspicious and went to check about Saba and Dollar at the Delhi airport.  He was told by the airport officials that there is no customs officer by the name of Saba and no woman from US was detained at the airport. Shukla later submitted an application with Surat city police and after preliminary inquiry the offence was registered by police on Thursday.
