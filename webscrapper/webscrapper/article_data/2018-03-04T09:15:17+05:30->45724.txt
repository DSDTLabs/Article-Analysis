AHMEDABAD: A team of the state’s anti-corruption bureau (ACB) conducted a decoy operation at the inter-state checkpost at Amirgadh in Banaskantha district on Friday and trapped an assistant inspector of RTO and a   ( ) guard for taking Rs 2,000 from a truck driver. Investigators believe this is part of an organized racket and the   has got four-day remand of the two accused for questioning.

 ACB officials said, working on complaints of corruption at the checkpost, a team led by inspector K J Patel got a truck driver to support them by acting as a decoy. When the driver reached the checkpost window, the persons present demanded Rs 2,000 to allow the truck to pass without checking. As soon as Kanti Dabhi, a GISF guard, and Hitesh Chaudhari, assistant RTO inspector, took the money, they were apprehended. Mukesh Patel, a private person who worked as a middleman, managed to escape. A case was filed against the three on Friday.
 
 “This is just one case where Rs 2,000 was demanded. On the basis of complaints received, we suspect a widespread racket of demanding money from vehicles going from   to Rajasthan. It is suspected that this nexus made between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh a day. Further investigation is under way to ascertain if more people are involved,” said an ACB official.
 
 An ACB initiative in 2016 had busted a state-wide racket causing losses to the exchequer. After the bust, reforms were put in place and a proposal to deploy armed guards was sent to the state government. After implementation of GST, when the need for inter-state checking to detect tax evasion has vanished, this incident throws light on corrupt practices, officials said.
