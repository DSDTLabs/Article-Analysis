PANAJI: Goa   personnel have been instructed to restrict data usage on the   cards provided to them by the department when they go on long leave. 

 A circular that was issued recently, stated that senior police officials had observed that phone numbers provided to personnel for official use were being utilised even when the personnel went on long leave such as maternity leave, childcare leave, etc. Personnel have, therefore, been asked to refrain from such misuse of the sim cards provided for official use.
 
 Last year, the north and south Goa superintendents of police had banned personnel from using their cellphones while on field duty, except to attend official calls. The SPs had said personnel were found surfing social media sites while on duty. 
 
 The circular regarding the usage of official sim cards is the second such instruction issued to discipline personnel regarding the usage of mobile phones for personal and official use.
 
 Police officials in charge of stations across Goa have also been asked to carry out random checks of personnel deployed for field duty and to record misconduct, if any, in the respective stationâ€™s diary.
