Mumbai:   of PNB were the biggest losers on the   on Tuesday, falling by as much as 12% to Rs 98. The fraud-hit bank fell to a new low after it disclosed in a late night filing on Monday that it has detected $204 million (or Rs 1,322 crore) of additional unauthorised letters of undertaking ( ) issued to Nirav Modi/Mehul Choksi group companies. 

 The increase meant that — as against the originally estimated size of $1,772 million (over Rs 11,300 crore) — the total fraud is now nearly Rs 12,622 crore (almost $2 billion).
 
 Following the decline in the share price, the bank’s market capitalisation has fallen to Rs 23,855 crore, which is only slightly higher than the Rs 20,302-crore m-cap of its housing finance arm PNB HF. Additionally, the bank has several other subsidiaries including PNB MetLife Insurance and PNB Gilts. It also has investments in UTI Mutual Fund. TOI had reported in its late city edition on Tuesday the additional $204-million fraud.
 
 Besides PNB, shares of other public sector banks too took a beating. BoI shares slumped 7.2%, IDBI 6.8%, Indian Bank 3.7%, and UCO Bank 2.4%. The scrip of BoM fell by 1.8%, BoB 1.6% and Allahabad Bank 0.8%.
 
 Brokers blamed the PNB fraud for the 99-point drop in the BSE sensex to 34,346 despite strong global cues. “The banking index was the major culprit, courtesy — yet another negative news flow with regards to PNB. The Nifty PSU Bank index is hastening towards its crucial support of 2,928 and, hence, traders should keep a close eye on this important junction as well,” said Angel Broking chief analyst Sameet Chavan.
 
 Meanwhile, ratings agency   said that several banks are likely to fall short of their regulatory capital requirement despite capital infusion by the government. This is because 11 banks have been placed under prompt corrective action (PCA) by the RBI following worsening of their financial parameters, including asset quality and capital adequacy. Many of these banks have issued additional tier-1 bonds that have equity features but can be recalled.
 
 According to an ICRA study, the PSBs had AT-1 bonds outstanding of Rs 60,385 crore. “Out of the banks that are currently under the PCA or are likely to come under PCA, around 60% of AT-I bonds totalling Rs 37,600 crore can be prematurely recalled,” said ICRA.
 
 ICRA VP (financial sector ratings) Anil Gupta said, “With a capital infusion of Rs 80,562 crore during Q4 FY2018, the effective recapitalisation will stand reduced for many PSBs. Accordingly, despite recapitalisation, some banks can potentially be lower than the regulatory Tier I capital requirements level (including capital conservation buffer) for March 31, 2018.”
