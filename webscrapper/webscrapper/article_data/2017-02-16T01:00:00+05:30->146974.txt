Choosing an apt release date is crucial for a film’s box office collections, which explains why filmmakers plan it months in advance. Directors  , who had initially announced that their next, ' ', would release on March 24, have advanced the date by a week. The film marks Abbas’ son Mustafa’s debut as an actor. 
When asked why the release was rescheduled, Abbas says, “We’ve got positive and encouraging response for the trailer and the songs, particularly 'Itna Tumhein', the video of which has registered a big number of hits online. Besides, March 17 seemed favourable because it’s an easier week and not crowded with too many releases. Moreover, we’ll be ready before time and we thought it’s wiser to make the most of the buzz around Machine.” While the chemistry between   and leading lady   has created curiosity, the car chase sequence and high-octane stunts in the trailer too have impressed the viewers. Abbas signs off saying, “Given that 'Machine' is Mustafa’s debut, it would also help him if his film releases in a clutter-free week.”
