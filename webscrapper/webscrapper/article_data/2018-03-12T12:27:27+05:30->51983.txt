HYDERABAD: In a major relief to lakhs of students, parents and the state government, the   on Sunday said it would postpone its proposed state bandh slated for March 13 keeping in view the intermediate public examinations. 

  founder president Manda Krishna   said, "We though the TRS government would postpone the examination to ensure that lakhs of students are not inconvenienced due to the bandh. But it has not done so. Keeping in view the future of our own students, we are postponing the bandh and will organise maha dharnas in every district and mandal head quarters," Krishna Madiga said.
 
 Lakhs of students are scheduled to take   exams in chemistry, commerce, sociology, fine arts and other subjects on March 13. Students and their parents were worried after the MRPS proposed bandh got the support of Left parties, Congress and Maoist frontal organisations and students' organisations of various universities. 
 
 Krishna Madiga said that their demand for categorisation of SCs into A, B, C and D groups would be intensified until the bill is introduced in Parliament.
 
 Earlier during the day, education minister Kadiam Srihari appealed to the MRPS to postpone March 13 bandh call in view of inter exams. He appealed to all the students scheduled to appear for the first year chemistry and commerce exams stating that all arrangements were in place and the exam would be conducted on the day.
 
 Srihari said MRPS and other political parties should take into account the future of students and reconsider their decision. Five lakh intermediate students are set to appear for the chemistry and commerce exam on March 13 and it could not be postponed because of Ugadi and Sri Rama Navami. "The exam cannot be postponed to April also as Inter exam results are to be declared by April 15," he said. Delaying results would also deprive students the opportunity of appearing for national competitive examinations, he pointed out.
