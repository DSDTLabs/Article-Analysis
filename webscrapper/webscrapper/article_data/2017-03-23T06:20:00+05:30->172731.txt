SILCHAR: Silchar MP   has urged the   to ask the   (IAF) to facilitate the process for allowing flights to land at Silchar airport at night. 

 In a letter to the defence ministry, Dev said Jet Airways is ready to operate   between Silchar and Kolkata soon and they have sought permission in this regard from the ministry of defence. She said Silchar airport at Kumbhirgram, which is manned by the IAF, has been extended and modernized to facilitate landing of all kinds of aircraft and all facilities for night landing are also in place.
 
 Dev sought the intervention of the defence ministry to allow Jet Airways flights between Silchar and Kolkata in the evening. This would go a long way in helping people of the area and also those visiting this part of Assam for business and trade, she said.
 
 In another letter written to Union minister of state for home Kiren Rijiju, the   said she has been told by the ministry of defence that the only impediment in facilitating night-landing is supply of personnel by CISF which is pending with the DG of the force. 
 
 Also, the cost of providing personnel will be borne by the Airports Authority of India. She urged Rijiju to persuade the CISF DG to supply sufficient personnel (35) to enable night-landing at Silchar airport.
