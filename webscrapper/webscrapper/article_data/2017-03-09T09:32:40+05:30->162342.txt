JAIPUR: Minorities have flayed the lack of support for minority communities in the Budget presented by chief minister Vasundhara Raje on Tuesday. The Budget remained silent on the long-pending demand for funds to complete construction of incomplete minorities’ hostels.

 “Nothing has been allocated for minorities in the Budget. Most of the hostels for students belonging to minority communities, announced in 2012, remain on paper. If the state is having budgetary constraints, then the community will fund it,” said Naim Rabbani, of Helping Hand Foundation.
 
 Rabbani has also asked the state to pay rent for Waqf properties acquired by them. “The state owes crores of rupees to Waqf. If the state pays rent on time, the community will not need anything,” said Rabbani.
 
 The Christian community too was disappointed as their demand for land for cemetery did not find mention in the Budget. The community is hard pressed for land to bury the dead in Jaipur and Dungarpur. The community has been making this demand for the last few years. “The community has never demanded anything other than land. If the state cannot grant a small piece of land, it shows their attitude towards us,” said Susai Manickam, a Christian priest.
 
 But the Sikh community’s demand to develop Gurudwara Budha Johad in Sriganganagar and Gurudwara Shri Charan Kamal Sahib in Naraina in Jaipur as tourist spots found mention in the Budget. This was done to commemorate the 350th birthday of Guru Gobind Singh.
