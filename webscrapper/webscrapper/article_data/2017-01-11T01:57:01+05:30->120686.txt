THANE: For 60-year-old Thaneite  , life was all about waking up to a pile of daily chores and ending the day by either watching television or just looking out of the window. However, her life took a new twist after she was introduced to the internet by her family.

 “I used to get lonely. So, after a lot of reluctance, I joined a social networking site. On that I added all the people from my building and area. Even though I have been living here I did not know my neighbour well. However, now I am always surrounded by women in my building who keep asking me to share some of my recipes, ” Dey said.
 
 Be it connecting with like-minded people in the area or pursue hobbies , everyone is latching on to the   to make life easier for themselves. Hiranandani Estate resident Shiv Mutoo (47), who was fed up with his daily commute from Thane to Fort, started a web page through which he began several carpooling groups.
