AURANGABAD: A special rally organised by   to press for the constitutional recognition of Lingayat as a separate religion and minority status to be given to the community, witnessed sizeable turnout, here on Sunday.

 The show of strength, which was organised close on the heels of contentious demands currently on anvil in neighbouring Karnataka state where Lingayat has considerable presence, saw participation of girls and women in good numbers as well. 
 
 Carrying saffron flags, the community members raised demands for separate religious identity and reservation benefit, braving scorching summer heat. The rally started from Kranti Chowk and concluded at the office of   divisional commissioner where community leaders addressed the participants. 
 
 One of the action committee leaders   said that all Lingayat community members follow principles and philosophy laid down by the 12th century social reformer  .
 
 “It is high time that the government should award constitutional recognition to us as a separate religion, which will fulfil aspirations of majority of community members,” he said, adding, “The Lingayat community has been facing a range of socio-economic problems and granting it the minority status and offering reservation subsequently, would end major woes of the community.” 
 
 The Karnataka government had formed a special panel to study the demand for a separate religion for Lingayats. The panel ruled that   in Karnataka may be considered as a religious minority and also recommended that the state government should request the centre to declare Lingayats as a religious minority. “Maharashtra government should also take official steps towards fulfilling our demand,” leaders said. 
 
 Earlier, city Mayor Nandkumar Ghodele and local Shiv Sena leaders visited the Lingayat leaders before the start of the rally to express their solidarity with the community.
