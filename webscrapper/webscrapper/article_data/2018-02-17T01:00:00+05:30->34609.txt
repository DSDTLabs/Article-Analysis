 About his film, Sudhir Mishra says, “I acknowledge the fact that the three characters are Sarat babu’s (author Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay). However, when we started writing the film,   started messing around with my head and it became a film about the lust for power and how it obstructs love. Then Paro escaped from the haveli and started confronting Dev and Chandramukhi. Though she’s a manipulator, she retained her love for Dev. In a way, the film became a reverse journey from Das to Dev. This is the plot of Daas Dev and a glimpse of that can be seen in the trailer.”
