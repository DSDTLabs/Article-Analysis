CHANDIGARH: The Kurukshetra district administration has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the death of former Sikh militant and activist Gurbaksh Singh  , a native of Thaska Ali village near Ismailabad.

 Stating this here on Monday, an official spokesman said   would conduct the inquiry into what made Khalsa commit suicide on March 20. Members of his family and relatives had alleged that he committed suicide under suspicious circumstances. The SDM would conduct an inquiry to know the cause of the suicide, investigate all aspects and submit report at the earliest, the spokesperson added.
 
 Khalsa was demanding the release of Sikh prisoners from various jails in India. In November 2013, Khalsa went on a 44-day hunger strike. The campaign ended after   jathedar   announced to take up the issue with the   government. His second campaign started on November 14, 2014, at   near Ambala, which lasted for 65 days.
