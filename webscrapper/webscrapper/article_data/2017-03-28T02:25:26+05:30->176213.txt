NEW DELHI: A seven-day-old girl was   wrapped in polythene near an open drain in   on Monday morning. 

 The infant, who was crying because of being bitten by mosquitoes, was spotted at 10.30am by a security guard near a private school in the area. The guard immediately informed the   who then took the girl to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital. A case has been registered against unknown people and the police are looking for the girl’s parents. 
 
 “The guard tried to look for her parents and called us when he could not find them,” said Milind Dumbere, DCP (northwest). He added that the girl is responding to treatment. Doctors told the cops that it seemed like the girl was dumped near the drain three to four hours before she was rescued, adding that she had mosquito bites all over the body as the polythene she was wrapped in had mosquitoes in it. Only her head was outside the polythene. The doctors declared her healthy after conducting all tests. 
 
 The police said that many people have come forward to adopt her. “Over 20 couples are keen on adopting the baby,” said a senior police officer. 
 
 A lady constable and the mother of a two year-old-boy, Ram Pyari, was appointed to take care of the baby. She said it was disturbing to come across cases of babies being abandoned by their parents.
