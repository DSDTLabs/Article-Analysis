MUMBAI: Dismissed high-profile ‘encounter specialist’  , who has been reinstated into the state   told TOI that he wanted to leave his controversies behind and was looking forward to a challenging stint till his retirement. 

 Sharma was dismissed on August 30, 2008, for his alleged links with the underworld. Sharma, once a favourite of the city police and who has 113 encounter killings to his credit, was even accused of “mixing up” with terrorists and members of organized crime syndicates. He was dismissed under Article 311 of the Constitution, which allows for summary dismissal without an inquiry.
 
  Sharma said his expertise in tackling the underworld will come in handy. Sharma said he was yet to receive a copy of the order. He had challenged his dismissal before the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (MAT), which ordered his reinstatement in 2009. The state went in appeal in the HC and three days before the court was to take it up for final hearing, Sharma was arrested for his role in a fake encounter case. 
 
 DGP Satish Mathur said, “We have received the government’s order and he will be posted once he reports.” He has three years left for his retirement. Sharma, who joined the police force in 1983 as a sub-inspector, rose to fame for his encounters and killing hardened gangsters of different gangs over a decade. He will return to the force as a senior inspector. In 2010, he was arrested by a special investigation team that probed the encounter of suspected Chhota Rajan associate Lakhan Bhaiyya. 
 
 In 2013, the trial court acquitted him but sentenced other police personnel to life imprisonment. The state’s appeal in the HC against his acquittal is pending.
