MUMBAI: A video showing a man collecting hafta (protection money) allegedly on behalf of a civic official from illegal hawkers in the busy Churchgate subway has created an uproar on social media. After the clip, shot and posted on Twitter by   leader Vivekanand Gupta, went viral, it seems that the man has been identified.

 Gupta tweeted again on Monday about the man, identified as  , and demanded action against him and the official at whose behest he was working. He posted Shaikh’s address and tagged the Mumbai police and   officials. Twitterati too prodded government agencies to get to the root of the matter. After the tweet, the BMC evicted all illegal hawkers from the subway on Monday.
 
  
 Last Tuesday, when Gupta was returning home from his office in south Mumbai, he saw Shaikh collecting money from an hawker. Hearing their conversation about money, Gupta started tailing him and recording his acts. Shaikh continued moving ahead and collecting money from each hawker.
 
 “I recorded the incident on my mobile. After I exited the subway and started walking towards the station, one of the hawkers alerted Shaikh that I had recorded everything. I immediately approached the railway police and alerted them. However, they told me that the area comes under   police jurisdiction. I then returned home and shared the video on Twitter. One of the persons who shared the video helped me establish Shaikh’s identity and provided me his home address.”
 
 When TOI got in touch with Shaikh’s son-in-law, he refused to comment. Senior civic official said they regularly check the subway for illegal hawkers. A ward officer has written to the police requesting an inquiry into the incident.
