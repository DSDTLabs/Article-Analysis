NEW DELHI: Real estate tycoon   moved the Supreme Court on Monday seeking parity in sentence with elder brother Sushil Ansal in the   tragedy case, that is he does not want to undergo the remaining part of his one year sentence. 

 Gopal and Sushil were let off last year by the SC with the sentence already undergone by them as adequate punishment provided each paid Rs 30 crore in fine. The SC had directed the Delhi government to use the Rs 60 crore for construction of a trauma centre. However, on review petitions filed by   led by Neelam Krishnamoorthy and the CBI, the SC on February 9 upheld Sushil’s sentence but asked Gopal to undergo full one year sentence. The SC had said that Sushil’s age-related ailments were taken into consideration for reducing his one year sentence to the period already undergone. 
 
 "On principle of parity, the same benefit (as given to Sushil) was extended to Gopal Ansal but he never was a case of any age-related complication. Therefore, it is not a fit case to apply principle of parity," the SC had said. After passing this order, the court had directed Gopal to surrender before the authorities within four weeks to undergo the remaining part of his one year sentence. 
 
 His team of lawyers led by senior advocate Ram Jethmalani is expected to mention his mercy application seeking parity in sentence with elder brother Sushil on Tuesday before a bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khehar.
