British   star Sir   has admitted his life is   right now. He insists his decision to step back from touring has nothing to do with his health.

  
  
 
 Reportedly, the 70-year-old has announced his retirement from live performances and has insisted that the decision was not made for negative reasons such as   but rather because he has been enjoying his life as a father to his two sons.
 
 "I'm not going to be going anywhere other than   for a long, long time," he told.
 
 "It's not based on health, it's not based on dwindling record sales. I've had the most fantastic, lucky career. I've enjoyed every single minute of playing live.
 
 "There have been dark times, they have been self-induced. And my life is so wonderful now. Ten years ago I wouldn't be sitting here saying this. But now with the boys, it's time," he added.
 
 The star did suffer a scare in May last year when he spent time in intensive care after contracting a potentially life-threatening infection on his way back to the UK from Chile.
