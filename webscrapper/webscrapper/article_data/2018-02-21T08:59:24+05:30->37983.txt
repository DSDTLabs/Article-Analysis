HYDERABAD: Coming to the aid of   workers in distress in Kuwait,   is providing air tickets for overstaying workers to return home, making use of the amnesty. On Tuesday, nine workers returned from   with assistance from Telangana Jagruthi. Another 15 are to return on February 21. 

 On Tuesday, the Kuwait government also announced extension of the amnesty period by two months. Now, overstaying workers can return by April 22 without penalties. The amnesty was initially announced from January 29 to Feb 22.
 
 Telangana   general secretary   said the organisation would provide air tickets to every Telangana worker in Kuwait who seeks assistance. A team of Telangana Jagruthi volunteers is in Kuwait helping workers complete their formalities and paper work. "We are providing air tickets to whoever is asking us," Achari said.
 
 Since the amnesty was announced, thousands of Indian workers returned to the country. Those staying in Kuwait without a legal work permit or overstaying would have otherwise run into problems, had there been no amnesty. They would have been sent to jail, if caught. They would also have had to pay penalties for overstaying and, after being deported, could never go back to Kuwait. Those returning during amnesty can go back to Kuwait and take up a job with proper visa and documentation later.
