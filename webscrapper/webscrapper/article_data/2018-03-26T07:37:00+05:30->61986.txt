DHARAMSHALA: Fewer pilgrims visited fairs organised in Himachal Pradesh’s   district as part of   this past week. 

 Kangra deputy commissioner  , who is the head of the shrines Brajeshwari, Chamunda and Jawala Ji in the district, said the rush of pilgrims was less than previous years, though they were yet to calculate the exact number of visitors.
 
 Varun Anand, a shopkeeper in the main market of temple town Kangra, said nearly 5,000 people were directly and indirectly dependent on visiting pilgrims for their earnings.  , who runs a hotel near Jawala Ji, said not many people visited the shrine this time around. “Usually, any pilgrim who comes to this part of the state definitely visits Jawala Ji,” he said.
 
 When asked about possible reasons behind the fall in pilgrims, the deputy commissioner said   coincided with school exams of many education boards in the country. “October and November are also considered as the seasons for pilgrimage. We are hoping a good rush of pilgrims then,” he said.
