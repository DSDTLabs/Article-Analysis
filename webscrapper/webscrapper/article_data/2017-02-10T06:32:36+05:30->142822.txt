BENGALURU: The probe into the Kogilu Cross firing in which rowdy-turned-politician Kadabagere Srinivas, alias Seena, was shot at on February 3 in Bengaluru, took an interesting turn on Thursday with   (BJP) denying his involvement and volunteering to undergo a narco-analysis test to establish his claim.

 Vishwanath said: “I am in no way involved in the attack on Seena, but the talk in police circles and some sections of the media is that I am part of it. Please don't fix me in this case. I am ready for a narco-analysis test to prove that I am not involved.“ Vishwanath, along with a few BJP legislators from the city, had met home minister   and expressed apprehensions about being implicated in the case.
 
 Seena, who became president of Dasanapura   (APMC) recently, had suffered injuries after he was shot at near Kogilu Cross on Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) Road by two unidentified bike-borne miscreants. Seena's condition contin ues to remain critical.
 
 During investigation, police found that Seena used to carry out real-estate business along with his brother Poison Rama, a rowdy sheeter, in the Nelamangala-Yelahanka area. Seena had associated himself with Vishwanath but parted ways with him following the 2013 assembly polls and joined the Congress at the behest of a senior party MP.
