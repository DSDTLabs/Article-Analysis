GORAKHPUR: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath inaugurated the   on   road which would connect Gorakhpur and its adjoining districts to Nepal and also laid foundation stone for widening and beautification of Mohripur-Sihorva road.

 “Mahesra Bridge was damaged in 2006 and since then we launched several movements for its construction. The foundation stone for the bridge was laid in 2009 and Centre allocated funds but it remained stuck due to corruption and inaction of state governments. We got the work completed in only 10 months,” said Yogi while slamming former governments.
 
 
 “This bridge connects Gorakhpur, adjoining districts to Nepal and the connectivity will help in growth, development and employment. Mohripur-Sihorva road will be widened from 3 metre to 7 metre,” he said. “The nation is progressing under PM Modi’s leadership. When we came to power 12,100 km road was full of potholes and only four-five districts got proper power supply. Today all 75 districts are getting power without any discrimination. UP government has started construction of national highway and we are working to create employment opportunities. We are working to ensure that farmers get good prize for their produce. There is no place for mafia and criminals in the state,” said Yogi.
 
 The CM also appealed people to stop power pilferage, get power connections and pay bills honestly.
 
 Yogi promised OPD at AIIMS in Gorakhpur by July 2018 and said, “We will launch massive sanitation drive from April and encephalitis vaccination programme.”
