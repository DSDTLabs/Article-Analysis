PANAJI: Two days after the Goa legislative assembly’s guidelines for accreditation of journalists to cover the assembly session attracted widespread criticism from mediapersons, speaker Pramod   said the guidelines are only a draft and are open to modification. 

 He said that since the guidelines are ‘not full and final’, there is no question of them being withdrawn. 
 
 “ Suggestions should come from your (journalists’) association and from the press advisory committee. The next assembly session will be in June. There is enough of time. We will give an opportunity for suggestions to be provided and then modify the guidelines,” Sawant said, at a media briefing called to address the issue. 
 
 He said that the press advisory committee should seek suggestions from the   (GUJ) afresh, before finalising the guidelines.
 
 The five-page guidelines have put restrictions on accreditation of journalists from weeklies, fortnightlies and monthlies, while journalists from newspapers with a minimum daily circulation of 15,000 copies will only be permitted entry to the press gallery.
 
 “We may have said a newspaper should have at least 15,000 circulation for its journalists to be eligible for accreditation, but here some newspapers that are new and may not have that kind of circulation. We will give relaxations in this regard,” said Sawant.
