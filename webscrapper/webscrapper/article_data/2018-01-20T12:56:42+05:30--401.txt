Panaji: For Indo-US bilateral trade and investment to increase, India must focus on  ,   and  , said US   in Mumbai Edgard Kagan on Friday.

 “I think improving the ease of doing business is very important. It refers to issues like procedures and government policies, as well as infrastructure, which is a challenge,” Kagan said in Panaji, adding, “Of course, it is being addressed, but I don’t think there is any place in India where you can say we have sufficient infrastructure. So that is clearly something that needs to be focussed on.”
 
 The consul general said though bilateral trade had risen from $30 billion in 2003-04 to $110-115 billion in 2016-17, trade levels were lower than potential.
 
 “Very candidly, I can say our bilateral trade is much lower than it should be. When you look at the size of the two markets, you look at the close linkages between companies, my view is we should see much more bilateral trade,” Kagan said.
 
 He, however, cautioned against looking at trade between the two nations from a transactional point of view and suggested that a strategic perspective has to be given to economic ties. “Instead of looking at each economic issue as a transaction, something where India wants this and US wants that, the two countries need to look at it from a strategic perspective,” Kagan said. “We should be looking at our economic relationship in a similar way that we look at strategic issues where it is not about how we can win on every single detail, but how we can both win in the aggregate,” he added.
 
 As part of the long-term objective in Indo-US relations, Kagan expressed his desire to see a   inked between the two nations. “Starting discussions on free trade is a significant policy stand and clearly an aspirational goal for us.”
