MUMBAI: Around 20 buildings at   in   have been facing a serious water problem for the past two months after   took up repairs of an old supply line.

 Local residents complain they are forced to purchase tanker water and the contaminated water has triggered health problems.
 
 Earlier, the BMC had claimed it would put up notices at all places where work was taken up, mentioning about the nature of work and the timeframe for completion. But that has remained an empty promise. Residents say BMC dragged its feet on the issue for long. BMC L-ward officer was unavailable for comment.
 
 Local corporator  , who had communicated the problem to civic officials, said, “There was a problem with the old water supply pipe, so they replaced it with a bigger one. Now only cross-connection work remains which is expected to be completed in a few days.” However, locals counter it, alleging for the past one month, BMC officials have been using the same line that work would be completed in a couple of days. “Civic officials are not giving us a clear reply. We have been calling for tanker water, but several residents have health complaints,” said Nelson D’Souza of Harshad Housing Society
