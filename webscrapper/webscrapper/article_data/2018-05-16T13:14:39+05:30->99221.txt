VADODARA: Days within inviting suggestions from citizens on the social media, the cops have begun a campaign to adopt   towards traffic menace. The traffic police has begun a campaign to tackle the traffic menace in some of the busiest areas of the city. Under the campaign, a team of 15 policemen led by a police inspector (PI) focuses on a particular area for some hours of the day.

 “The team visits the areas that faced traffic hazards. The police then starts the drive to remove encroachments like roadside eateries and illegal parking that causes traffic snarls. Also, commuters flouting traffic rules are penalized,” said Amita Vanani, ACP (traffic). The team also removes illegal hoardings that cause traffic obstruction.
 
 The traffic cops have conducted such zero tolerance drives in Diwalipura area where they penalized commuters not wearing helmets while driving. On the Sardar Estate Road, the cops removed eateries and stalls that were placed illegally by the roadside. A similar drive was started to remove roadside eateries between Fatehgunj and Chhani.
 
 In Harni, the cops cracked down on the illegal parking on the roadside. “We also removed roadside eateries on the Gorwa Road and conducted a drive to enforce traffic rules near BRG Circle. The drive is meant to improve traffic safety and also ensure that people follow rules. We will continue with the campaign in the coming days,” Vanani told TOI.
 
 Citizens had made a number of suggestions to the traffic cops in an online interaction initiative organized by city police commissioner Manoj Sashidhar. From removing encroachments to improving traffic policing, a number of suggestions were given to the cops. The police have said that it will organize such interactions regularly to get feedback from the citizens.
