PANAJI: A week after Kishore  , a 34-year-old   constable, was found hanging at  , the case has continued to baffle police officials and is nowhere close to being cracked, according to sources.

 Though a case of murder has been registered after preliminary investigations, no leads of possible suspects have been found yet.
 
 Sources said that after examining the details of phone calls and the victim’s interactions on a messaging app, no signs of any threats or suspicious activity were found. 
 
 Shirodkar was also found to have not been drunk at the time of his death and no major injuries on the body exist, sources said.
 
 The victim was discovered to have taken huge loans from private agents, but investigations have been unable to reveal where the money was spent by him. “The investigators are baffled as to where Shirodkar could have spent such a huge amount as there seems to be no assets worth that money,” said a source.
 
 Besides the connection between Shirodkar’s death and the loans he had taken, investigators are now looking into the possibility of souring ties between the victim and a relative.
 
 The postmortem report stated the cause of death as “asphyxia as a result of constriction of neck by ligature material”. Shirodkar is survived by his wife and two children.
