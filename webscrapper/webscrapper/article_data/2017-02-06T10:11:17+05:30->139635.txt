SASARAM: The defalcation of Rs1.19 crore of old Rs1,000 notes from the Sasaram main branch of   (MBGB) turned out to be a mistake by its employees in mentioning the correct number of demonetised notes while depositing the bundles in the   chest.
 
  Confirming the mistake on Sunday, MBGB’s regional manager   said, “In fact, the bank officials had put 48,000 bundles of Rs 1,000 old notes (Rs 4.80 crore) in the box, but while sealing the box wrote just 36,000 bundles. The local RBI, without verifying the amount, gave a receiving certificate of Rs 3.60 crore only. Thus, Rs 1.20 crore was found missing.”
  
  On the request of senior officers of the Gramin Bank, a three-member team of RBI and SBI reached Sasaram on Sunday and opened the currency chest and found the ‘missing’ amount in the box number 3.
  
  Trivedi, who had lodged an FIR on January 28 this year, however, said departmental proceedings would continue against the five bank employees, including branch manager, for their negligence which gave the bank a bad name. The ‘defalcated’ amount was found at RBI’s currency chest, which is at the State Bank of India’s main branch at Sasaram.
