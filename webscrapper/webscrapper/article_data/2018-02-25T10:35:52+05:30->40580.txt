MANGALURU: Dakshina Kannada police foiled a bid by a murder accused who had been elusive for seven years and wanted to start a new life in  .

 Superintendent of Police B R Ravikanthegowda said Abdul Rahiman, an accused in the murder of history-sheeter Santhosh alias ‘Candle’ Santhu which rocked Polali in 2009, was planning to move to Saudi Arabia on February 23 but immigration officials at the   apprehended him.
 
 Rahiman had been   in the case and attending trials in the court for at least six months. However, he secured bail and then managed to hoodwink the cops since then.
 
 Immigration officials, who had a tip-off about Rahiman, nabbed him with his baggage at the airport. He’ll soon be handed over to cops at the Bantwal Rural station.
 
 Ravikanthegowda said Rahiman may have been booked under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC in another case. He said he was looking into old case files and pending cases, if any, against Rahiman, will be investigated.
 
 ‘Candle Santhu’, who had links with some saffron outfits, was hacked to death near his house at Badakabail near Polali Junction on February 18, 2009. He had been involved in several murder cases in the district and facing criminal cases in various police stations across the district.
