In order to trap Mahi in his own game, Pinki calls Kamini and asks her if she wants something else at the sangeet function. Kamini drops a hint in favour of more jewellery. Pinky then asks the impostor if they should go ahead and give diamonds worth 200 crores to Kamini and her family.   agrees. Shakti asks him to get ready then as he is the only one who knows the password of the locker. 

 They all go to the locker area and ask Mahi to open the safe. Mahi begins to feel trapped and tells them that he has forgotten the password. He doesn't remember anything of it. He cites headache as an excuse to leave, but Anika gives him a medicine. Meanwhile, Shivaay scans the locker door with his eyes and goes.
 
  
  
 Looking at the open safe, Mahi is ecstatic but Tej tells him there is another safe that he has to open by scanning his eyes. This time around the alarm rings, and Mahi tells them that there is some problem with the system. He tells them he has a headache and leaves. 
 
 Mahi goes to Kamini who pushes him to get the diamonds. When Mahi returns to the house, Anika, Pinky and Shivaay look at him. It is then that Shivaay reveals how he plans to get Mahi embroiled in a murder case so he confesses his crime.
