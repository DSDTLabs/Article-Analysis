CHANDIGARH: Doctors at the bronchoscopy clinic of PGIMER’s pulmonary medicine have written to the Union ministry of health and family welfare, asking for help in the face of a sudden spurt in patient rush over the last three months. 

 The department recently submitted a report to the Union ministry on this. The department, which gets 10 patients everyday on an average, is getting a daily inflow of 30 patients of lung diseases like lung tumour, cancer, chronic cough and interstitial lung disease, which requires bronchoscopy. According to doctors, if this continues, they will investigate the reason for increase in numbers. 
 
 Till March 31 last year, 1,784 bronchoscopies were done. This year, the count has risen to 2,100 till date. “It is difficult for us to manage these cases and we are shocked by the sudden rise in referral cases from adjoining states of Punjab, Haryana and  ,” said Dr Ritesh Agarwal of the department of pulmonary medicine. 
 
 No reason has been identified for the steep rise in numbers. “If this continues, we shall try and investigate the reasons,” said Dr Agarwal. To manage the rush, the diagnostic facility, which was three times a week, has been extended to five times a week since the past one month. “There are eight bronchoscopy machines and only four to five doctors to manage it. Most of the patients come from places where there is no such facility,” said a faculty member. 
 
 The patients cannot be referred to any other centre. “Earlier, we had been seeing 200 new patients and almost the same number of old patients. In the last three months, we have 400 new and 400 old patients,” said Dr Ritesh.
