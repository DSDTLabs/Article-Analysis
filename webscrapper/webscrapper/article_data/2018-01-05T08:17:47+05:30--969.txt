AHMEDABAD:   have been the bane of a million   and a cause of shame for AMC. However, after   and terse comments from the high court, the civic body was further jolted by forensic laboratory reports over quality of roads procured by its  , and on Wednesday and Thursday, it sent off some 38 recovery and penalty notices to six road contractors. The AMC estimates it will be able to recover 27.7% of road construction and resurfacing costs by this means. 

 “AMC had spent an estimated Rs 18 crore for construction and resurfacing of some 45 stretches of roads in the city. Of these, some Rs 3 crore has been recovered through recovery notices while the remaining Rs 2 crore was levied as penalty,” said a top source in AMC.
 
 It may be worthy to note that once a road is constructed by a given contractor, there is a defect-liability period of three years. Top sources in AMC said that all the 38 notices that had been issued were for damages caused within six to eight months of the construction of the roads to three years. 
 
 In fact, three of the six contractors had been blacklisted by the AMC in July-August last year, after potholes and poor road conditions played havoc on commuters. A maximum of notices were served by the New West Zone, amounting to some 18 notices while the central zone issued only two notices to road contractors.
 
 The issue of poor road conditions had been raised in the zero hour of the standing committee on Thursday, where it was learnt that the road resurfacing, repair and construction work had not been undertaken for a long while after Diwali.
