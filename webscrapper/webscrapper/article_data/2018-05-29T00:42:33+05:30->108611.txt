NEW DELHI: Tata Group-owned Indian Hotels Company Limited ( ) approached the Supreme Court on Monday, challenging the   order which had dismissed its plea against the tender procedure for the proposed auction of the capital’s iconic   by  .

 IHCL mentioned the petition before a vacation bench of Justices L   and M M Shantanagoudar for an urgent hearing. Agreeing to hear the plea, the bench posted the case for June 1. 
 
 The HC had on May 22 rejected IHCL’s plea and allowed   to proceed with the auction. The court said it is “apparent that the complex nature of eligibility conditions that NDMC has insisted upon, while considering tenders for the hotel plot, are based on thought and deliberation” and refused to intervene in a policy decision.
 
 “As held by the Supreme Court, time and again, the wisdom of a particular policy cannot be considered, but its legality or procedural fairness is subject to review. If these factors are kept in mind, the fact that some conditions could have been better phrased, or that some more conditions could have been introduced is not sufficient to conclude that the conditions that have been prescribed are arbitrary and unreasonable,” the HC had said.
 
 In April 2017, the Supreme Court had allowed the civic agency to e-auction the five-star hotel, which is currently being run by IHCL. IHCL argued before the high court that NDMC had failed to consider last year’s SC order that they had an unblemished track-record and should be given weightage in the tender.
 
 IHCL had completed the construction of the hotel building, consisting of approximately 300 rooms, with all other allied facilities and started the commercial operation of the hotel from October 10, 1978. The agreement period of 33 years is reckoned from the said date and the company had incurred an expenditure of Rs 461.61 lakh. The agreement expired in 2011 and NDMC decided to auction the property, hoping to fetch a better price for granting the lease.
