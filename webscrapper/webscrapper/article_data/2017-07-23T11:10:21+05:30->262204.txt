HYDERABAD: The 57-foot tall   idol is getting finishing touches. But doubts persists over the 'maha laddu' that has been associated with the   Ganesh for many years.

 Thousands of devotees eagerly wait for the maha laddu prasadam. Devotees say it tastes similar to the famous Tirupati laddu. The maha laddu remains fresh for more than 10 days.

Later, the committee decreased the idol's height to 59. There were problems during the immersion due to the height of the idol.
 
 The Khairatabad Ganesh has been receiving laddu free of cost. Other Utsav committees purchase laddu. Till 2009, the   committee used to keep 50 kg laddu at the pandal. In 2010, a sweet-maker from the tiny village of Tapeswaram in East Godavari district, PVVS   (Malle Babu), began to donate the laddu to Khairatabad Ganesh. He continued with the offering till 2016.
 
 In 2010 he donated a laddu weighing about 500kg, subse quently in 2011 he increased the weight to 2,400 kg. The we ight of the laddu increased to 3,600 kg in 2012, 4,200 kg in 2013, 5,000 kg in 2014), and 6,000 kg in 2015. However, in 2016 he donated a laddu weig hing only 500 kg. He used to perform special pooja to Ga nesh before starting the pre paration of the laddu prasa dam in his shop. A Ganesha idol was installed in a pandal and all those involved in lad du preparation wear   ha mala.
 
 A video documentary was shot on the preparation of the laddu. The documentary was titled `Maha Ganapathiki Maha Naivedyam'. It was released by Governor ESL Narasimhan.
