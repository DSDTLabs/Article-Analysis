PANAJI: The overall pass percentage of the Goa Board’s Class XII exam dropped by over 3% as 85.8% of the 17,739 students were declared successful. The drop was a direct result of poor performance in science by some of the new higher secondary schools, said officials of the Goa   of Secondary and Higher Secondary  , which conducts the exam. 

  
 
 Six higher secondary schools that offer science saw fewer than 60% of the students pass the exam, while another nine recorded a pass percentage of 60-70%, officials said. 
 
 “As science stream students are increasingly opting for engineering for higher studies, science stream higher secondary schools are finding it challenging to get good teachers,” Goa Board chairman Ramkrishna Samant said. “The higher secondary schools whose performance has dipped will be asked to investigate and take remedial measures.” 
 
 An overall pass percentage of 82.3% was recorded in the science stream. Of the 107 higher secondary schools in Goa, 64 offer science. 
 
 Samant said that the performance in science stream had mainly dropped in mathematics. Nearly one in five students who appeared for the mathematics paper in the science stream could not clear it. This failure ratio was the highest for any subject at these  .
 
 “The new higher secondary schools offering science programme need to think if they really should continue offering science,” said Goa Board’s secretary, Bhagirath Shetye.
 
 At the 2018 Class XII exam, 4,496 students appeared from the science stream. The commerce stream saw an almost similar number of 4,893 appearing for the exam, but, as compared to science, the commerce stream saw 90.6% clear the exam, which was held across 16 centres from March 5 to 26. 
 
 In the arts stream, 3,474 students appeared for the exam, with 85.2% clearing it. The vocational stream, for which 2,364 students appeared, saw a pass percentage of 84.5%. 
 
 2018 saw the largest-ever number of students appear for the Class XII board examinations. 
 
 87.4% of the girls who appeared for the exam passed, while among boys, the percentage was 80.1%. 
 
 The concession of sports merit marks saw 255 clear the exam with its help. 3,743 students availed those marks. This helped raise the overall Class XII pass percentage by 1.4%.
 
 Fifteen higher secondary schools of the 107 in the state saw between 95% to 100% of its students clear the Class XII examination, Samant said. 
 
 The highest pass percentage came from the Porvorim centre, with almost 97% clearing it, while the lowest was from Ponda, with 75%.
