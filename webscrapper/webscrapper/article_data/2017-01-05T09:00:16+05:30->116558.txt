LUCKNOW: Poll schedule has been announced but the feud within the   is far from over. The bitter battle of supremacy within the party's first family has now put a question mark on which side will ride the bicycle-the party symbol-this election, or whether both sides will go to polls with a new election symbol. 

 With truce between the two factions led by Mulayam Singh and his son   nowhere in sight, both factions have approached the   to claim the cycle symbol, ahead of the   polls. Chief election commissioner Nasim Zaidi said on Wednesday that the commission will examine the petitions of the two parties before taking a call on their respective claims. 
 
 "Let us first examine the documents submitted by both groups," said Zaidi, referring to claims by warring factions of the Samajwadi Party led by its chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.
 
 Meanwhile, uncertainity on the election symbol has left party leaders confused. Unsure who the   will be allotted to from either of the two factions or will be frozen by the ECI, the candidates whose names have been announced by both the camps have also put their campaign on hold.
