Colva: The   panchayat meeting held on Tuesday witnessed a ruckus over panch membersâ€™ resolution to delay issuance of showcause notice to Raheja Universal Limited over the construction licence issued to them. 

 The notice was to be issued to the real estate developer based on the September 14 inspection report. However, the village body decided to seek the legal opinion of two advocates over the report first.
 
 Speaking to reporters after the meeting, sarpanch Winston Dias said the report had been submitted by their architect Carlos Gracias and would be sent to advocates for legal advice before a decision on the future course of action was taken.
 
 Dias said that since the panchayat has to file its reply in the public interest litigation before the high court, they had to necessarily appoint an advocate and that they would seek the legal opinion of this advocate and another, who is yet to be appointed.
 
 On the Verde Resort issue, the body resolved to summon the promoters of the resort and the complainant to the panchayat office and work out a solution. The villagers demanded that a resolution be passed for immediate site inspection based upon the complaint of Maria Fernandes.
 
 Since the expectation of the villagers was not met, the newly elected panchas came under fire, with villagers almost assaulting a member who went against their wishes
 
 Six out of the seven panchayat members are new faces, elected based on their leanings towards the aspirations of the villagers.
