CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court on Friday asked the chief secretary of Haryana to decide on representation seeking disqualification of four BJP MLAs of the state on the basis of recent disqualification of 20 MLAs of   in Delhi.

 A division bench comprising Justice Surya Kant and Justice   passed these orders while disposing of a petition filed by advocate  . The bench has asked the chief secretary to consider the issue raised by the petitioner and to take a final decision on the matter, after discussing it with the appropriate authority, within three months.
 
 The MLAs, whose disqualification has been sought, include Shyam Singh Rama, Dr Kamal Gupta, Seema Trikha and Bakshish Singh Virk. All these were earlier appointed as chief parliamentary secretaries by the   government but the high court had set aside their appointment on July 5, 2017.
 
 The petitioner had submitted that the Presidentâ€™s orders, as in the case of 21 AAP MLAs, deserve to be applied even in the case of four Haryana MLAs. He had sought directions for immediate disqualification these MLAs from the state legislative and no pension to them.
 
 A division bench headed by Justice S S   had quashed the appointment of these four MLAs from the post of chief parliamentary secretary on the ground that these were against Article 164 (1-A) of the Constitution, according to which the number of council of ministers cannot exceed above 15% of the total strength of the state assembly.
