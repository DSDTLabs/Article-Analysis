 “If such instances keep taking place frequently what is the use of installing CCTVs when no one is there to monitor them. Along with cameras, there should also be security guards posted in the premises round the clock. Moreover, the hospital is currently low on staff as around 80 nurses, technicians and doctors have gone on an indefinite strike. Because of this, patients are considering going to Mumbai for treatment,” said a patient.
 
 Meanwhile, the authorities claimed that they will be beefing up security at the premises by deploying more watchmen inside as well as outside the hospital.
