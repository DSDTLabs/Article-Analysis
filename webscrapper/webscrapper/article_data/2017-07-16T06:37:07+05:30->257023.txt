HYDERABAD: Eight persons, including seven supari killers, were arrested by   police in a case where a man attempted to kill his son-in-law on Saturday as the latter was harassing his wife.

 Cyberabad joint commissioner of police Shahnawaz Qasim, in a press release issued here, said eight persons -Vasudeva Reddy, Kondal Reddy, Mazahar Khan, Mohammed Amjad, Mohammed Afsar, Naveed Pasha, Abdul Qadar, Syed Wasim-were arrested.
 
 Explaining the case, Shahnawaz said   police first apprehended six members near Hanuman temple, Old  , who were waiting there to kill Vasudeva Reddy's son-inlaw G Shyam Sunder Reddy, owner of Hitech Petrol Pump at Old Hafeezpet. Police also recovered nine daggers in an auto used by them.
 
 On questioning the six persons, police discovered that Vasudeva Reddy, a businessman, had hatched a conspiracy to kill Shyam Sunder Reddy as he was not taking care of the former's daughter and ignored the couple's children.
 
 â€œDue to the ongoing matrimonial disputes, Vasudeva Reddy had engaged a supari gang and offered to pay Rs 18 lakh for the hit. Vasudeva paid an advance of Rs. 2 lakh. Ch. Kondal Reddy, a real estate agent, introduced and mediated between Vasudeva Reddy and the hired assassins,'' the Joint CP said.
 
 The hired killers failed to execute their plan on three occasions, including once near a local court where the victim attended hearing in a case filed by his wife demanding maintenance.
 
 On Friday, when the contract killers were waiting for an opportunity to kill Shyam at his petrol bunk, police nabbed them since they already had information about a supari gang's plan to eliminate a person.
 
 Of the arrested accused, Mazahar Khan was allegedly involved in a murder case in 2002, Amjad was involved in two murder cases, Afsar, Khadar, Wasim, all historysheeters and Pasha, an extortionist. Police were on the look out for Syed Mohammed.
