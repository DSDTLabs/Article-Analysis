BENGALURU: A 25-year-old mechanical engineering student lodged in  ,  , has written to   Subhro Kamal Mukherjee and home minister  , seeking their intervention to develop a generator. The machine will run without fuel and power all prisons across the state. 

 Convicted in a bank robbery and Arms Act cases, Devesh Kumar Singh from Madhya Pradesh is serving an eight-year jail term. A student of an engineering college in Soladevanahalli, north Bengaluru, he barged into a bank on Hesaraghatta Main Road, looted Rs 15 lakh and fired at a customer before fleeing in November 2012. The customer died in hospital and Devesh was arrested near Majestic, when he was getting ready to board a Delhi-bound train. Trial in the murder case is still on. 
 
 Devesh now wants to live the dream he has nurtured since his college days. “I want is to prove to my father that I am worthy of something. A friend of mine had cheated me of the money that I had borrowed from my father to develop the generator. That made me commit the crime,” he told TOI through his father Vidya Singh, a retired school master now settled in Arunachal Pradesh.
 
 The youngster, however, is not ready to provide details of his project, adding he is ready to get it technically evaluated. “People may wonder how a generator will run without fuel. Give me a chance, I will prove it,” Vidya quoted his son.
 
 
 
 If Devesh wants to develop the generator, we will support him and provide him the necessary equipment. After looking at the prototype, we will decide on installing it at other prisons across the state. Prison officials always encourage inmates who are willing to do something
