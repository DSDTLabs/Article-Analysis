PATNA: Hours after a   to death on   in Gopalganj district in the wee hours on Friday, photographs showing a liquor bottle and chicken inside the vehicle went viral on the social media, prompting opposition to ridicule the prohibition in the state.

 “Sahib preached whole lot of knowledge on prohibition on Thursday even as policemen, who report to the home department headed by him, are moving with liquor bottle and chicken,” leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav tweeted, in an oblique reference to CM Nitish Kumar’s speech at an official function organised in Patna to mark the completion of two years of booze ban.
  
  Apparently referring to the frequent seizure of consignments of India-made foreign liquor smuggled from Jharkhand and Haryana, Tejashwi also asked Nitish to explain why liquor was being smuggled from the two states even though they were ruled by his mentor party, BJP.
  
  Meanwhile, Saran range DIG Vijay Kumar Verma told TOI over the phone that an inquiry was being conducted by the Gopalganj SP to find out if the liquor bottle and chicken were planted inside the police vehicle or policemen were carrying them. “We are also waiting for the medical reports of the five occupants — an SI, three constables and a driver — of the vehicle, based on which further action will be taken,” the DIG said, adding the policemen had left the spot after the accident.
 Meanwhile, Mohammadpur police station SHO Vinay Pratap Singh said the deceased woman was identified as Kiran Devi, a mother of three-month-old and 18-month-old daughters. The woman’s husband, Vinay Kumar, has given a written complaint in this regard, the SHO said and added the vehicle was damaged by irate villagers after the incident.
