For  , friendships last longer than stardom. While most actors would stay away from doing special appearances especially when their star power is on the rise, Tovino has no qualms whatsoever in lending a helping hand.

 The latest Malayalam release   had him as a cop. On taking up roles with less screen time, Tovino says," I am never averse to doing a cameo in a friend's movie. I don't think my appearance in Charlie was a step down for me. I had free time, so I obliged. But if I was gearing up for another movie and with a specific getup and build then I don't think I would just go ahead to do the cameo."
 
 
 The actor took the role in Ezra as most of the cast and crew were his friends. "Ezra has Prithviraj in the lead. I know a lot of people in the crew of the film ' director Jay K, cinematographer Sujith Vaassudev and others. So, it's a friendly appearance with limited screen space. But it's an important role in the movie."
 
 Tovino's next releases are Oru Mexican Aparatha, in which he plays dual roles and Godha, which has him as a wrestler.
