 Health department officials claimed rules were being finalised for strict execution of the Act that will introduce a cap on prices for various treatments at private hospitals having more than 50 beds. A majority of the big private hospitals, which would eventually come under the Act, are based in Gurugram and  . 
 
 The officials added the move had come in the wake of a number of recent cases of private hospitals being accused of overcharging and negligence. Dr  , additional director-general of health services, said, "The Haryana government is serious about implementing the Act. The rules are being formed and will be implemented soon." The Act was implemented in 10 states -Sikkim, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan Uttarakhand and Assam and all Union Territories except Delhi - till December 18, 2017. 
 
 Following the trend, last month, the   passed the Haryana Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Adoption Bill, 2018, paving the way for implementation of the central Act, albeit with some modifications, to provide quality healthcare across the state.
 
 Once implemented, the Act would make it mandatory for hospitals with over 50 beds to display services they provide and their costs prominently. Also, hospitals would have to display lists of their doctors, and disclose qualifications of nurses and other medical staff. 
 
 Under the Act, a district registration authority will be formed that will register all hospitals and will have the power to inspect them. Further, sources said there would be provisions that would make it mandatory for private hospitals to renew their registration every 5 years. "The Act will help establish a control on corporate hospitals, which is needed. We feel this Act is fine," said Dr Dinesh Hans, President, Indian Medical Association, Gurugram.
