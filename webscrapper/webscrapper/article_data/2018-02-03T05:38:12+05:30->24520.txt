BENGALURU: Kannada outfits called off on Friday the   they had planned for Sunday, when PM Modi visits the capital of poll-bound Karnataka for a BJP rally. 

  The decision came hours after the Karnataka high court restrained them from carrying out their plans and directed the state government and law enforcement agencies to take all steps necessary to ensure neither commerce and industry nor the life of the common man was affected if the bandh was effected. The bandh was reportedly aimed at seeking the PM's intervention in the state's dispute with Goa over the river Mahadayi, precipitated recently by reports that Karnataka had resumed the construction of a canal to divert its waters. The organisations would now observe a 'black day' on Sunday. 
 
 The protest was timed to coincide with Modi's visit to the city to addressing a BJP rally. This bandh was to follow a Karnataka bandh observed on January 25 on the same issue."There cannot be any bandh. The   has already said that a bandh violates the fundamental rights of citizens and it's illegal as well as unconstitutional," a division bench headed by Acting Chief Justice H G Ramesh observed, citing the directions issued by the Supreme Court in various judgments, including in the AIADMK vs   case (2009) and   of India vs   (1998).
