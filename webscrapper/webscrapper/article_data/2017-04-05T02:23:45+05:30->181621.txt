GURUGRAM:   Renewable   (HAREDA) has said the billing   as per guidelines of the 2014   plant scheme is now ready. The development comes amid complaints that consumers were not getting the rebate mandated as per the solar policy, owing to glitches in ‘net’ meters. 

 Naveen Verma,   superintendent engineer, said power bills for the next cycle will be generated through the software. On March 10, TOI reported some consumers had complained field staff lacked training to read from bi-directional meters used under the scheme.
 
 “Two months ago, when linemen came to to read the meters, they were clueless and said they had not received any training, which had been given only to senior officers,” a Sector 10A resident said.
 
 A HAREDA official said training sessions have been arranged for field staff. “We took two months to effect the change along with DHBVN, which has now started generating computerised bills,” said Gurgaon additional deputy commissioner  , chief project officer of the new and renewable energy department. “We trained DHBVN field staff, but we’ll hold more sessions if needed,” he said. 
 
 The state government announced its grid-connected solar plant scheme in 2014, making it mandatory for consumers living on plots with area up to 500 sqyd to install solar panels, for which the state would award them “bountiful” subsidy. The same policy was made mandatory for schools, malls, hotels and industrial units. Under Haryana renewable energy guidelines, domestic consumers can avail of Re 1 incentive per unit of solar power generated. The figure for industrial consumers is 25 paisa per unit.
