NEW DELHI: Days after its reopening,   has once again come under the scanner of the   (CZA) — this time for not submitting   for the past three quarters for Schedule I and Schedule II animals.

 The report lists the stock of animals, the number of deaths and births and the number of animals acquired during the quarter.
 
 According to the CZA, reminders were made to the zoo authorities, but no quarterly reports were submitted for the financial year beginning April 2016. “We collect an annual inventory and mortality report, while also collecting quarterly ones with detailed autopsy records on the number of dead animals. We are yet to receive any for this financial year, while the annual report for last year also came to us two months late,” said a CZA official.
 
 The zoo recently saw deaths of a jaguar and a young western hoolock gibbon among other animals. Animal activists have also raised questions over the rising number of deaths, with Union minister and animal activist Maneka Gandhi asking the CZA to launch an enquiry into it.
 
 “We are waiting to see the quarterly reports to get a clearer picture on the number of deaths this year and then come out with the final figures,” said the CZA official.
 
 Delhi zoo also reported three lion-tailed macaque deaths in their last annual report, but zoo officials insist that focus is being given on breeding and preservation of species. “A lot of animals have given birth recently, including some Schedule I species. Our attention is towards successfully breeding them,” said a zoo official.
