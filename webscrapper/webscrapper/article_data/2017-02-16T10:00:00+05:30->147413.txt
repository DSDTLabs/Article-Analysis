DEHRADUN: Even as we complete 100 days of demonetisation, its effect can still be felt in the state. Political parties contesting elections in Uttarakhand complained about fund crunch hampering their campaigns post note ban. While parties like   said that they had to curb expenses on canvassing, smaller parties could only manage door-to-door campaigns. However, the expenditure of a few BJP leaders were nearly Rs four lakh more as compared to 2012 elections.
 
  According to the EC report, Congress had spent Rs 5,88,50,000 in 2012 election, out of which, the total expenses incurred on candidates were Rs 5,60,00,000. The Congress candidates were given Rs 8 lakh by the party for campaigning during last election, which the members said they did not receive this year due to lack of funds since donations were negligible.
  
  Current MLA of Rajpur Road, Rajkumar, who is contesting from the same seat on a Congress ticket, said, “In 2012 elections, I had spent over Rs 20 lakh in campaigning, but this time my expenditure was approximately Rs 14 lakh, through which only the basic expenses could be covered.”
  
  BJP leaders too claimed to have faced the effects of demonetisation. The party members claimed to have received Rs 10 lakh for election this year. However, the   report states that the party gave Rs 5 lakh to each candidate in 2012. Trivendra Singh Rawat, BJP candidate from Doiwala, said, “Last elections I had spent approximately Rs 8 lakh, though this time it has crossed over Rs 12 lakh due to inflation. The party also gave me Rs 10 lakh to fund the publicity. However, the impact of demonetisation was felt in donations.”
  
  Other parties like CPI and NCP claim that their condition was even worse as they could manage only door-to-door campaigns.  , NCP candidate from Dehradun Cantt said, “I have just spent Rs 4.5 lakh. Hence, there were no grand rallies or advertisements. We just went door to door to convince the voters to choose NCP.”
