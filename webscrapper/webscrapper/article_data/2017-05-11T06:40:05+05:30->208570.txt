 The state government had acquired the land for building a grain market at Sema more than a year ago. Some land of Jaswant also came to be acquired. He was facing problem in getting compensation of nearly Rs 2 lakh due to incorrect records and was visiting patwari to have the issue resolved, the family said.
 
 Jaswant’s son Gurdeep Singh alleged Jagjit had demanded money to make the correction, which they were unable to pay. “My father used to visit the patwari but always came back empty handed. He did not tell us exactly that how much money we were to get for acquisition, though it was nearly Rs 2 lakh. After he failed to get his grievance addressed, my father went to the patwarkhana (revenue office) at Sema and ended his life there,” Gurdeep said.
 
 When contacted, Bathinda SSP Naveen Singla said, “Police have recovered a suicide note from the shirt pocket of Jaswant Singh and a case under section 306 (abetment to suicide) is being registered against patwari Jagjit Singh, Tarlochan and Raj Singh. All of them are at large.”
