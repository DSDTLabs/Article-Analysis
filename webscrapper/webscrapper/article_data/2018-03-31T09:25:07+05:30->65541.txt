AHMEDABAD:   high court has issued a notice to Kutch district collector and other authorities concerned in response to a PIL filed by a woman who claimed that her land was acquired by the   ( ) but compensation has not been paid.

 The dispute in this case is with regard to eligibility of owning agriculture land in Gujarat by farmers from other states. The authorities said that they have not disbursed the land acquisition award to the woman because she is not a registered farmer of Gujarat and does not have the khedutpothi.
 
 Petitioner in this case, Geeta Thakkar, had purchased a parcel of land in Meghpar village near Anjar of Kutch district. The NHAI acquired part of her land for the road building project and the compensation was fixed at Rs 52.5 lakh. The authority has already taken possession of the land, but she has yet not received the compensation amount. This brought her to the high court, said his advocate Nimish Kapadia.
 
 Before the HC, the petitioner submitted that the compensation amount has been deposited by the NHAI with the sub-divisional magistrate at Anjar. The SDM and the acquisition officer did not make payment of compensation to her on the ground that she is not a khedutpothi holder and hence could not have purchased agriculture land in Gujarat.
 
 Thakkar had made a representation in this regard, to which the authorities said that the issue of entitlement to own agriculture land in Gujarat by farmers from other states is pending before the Supreme Court.
