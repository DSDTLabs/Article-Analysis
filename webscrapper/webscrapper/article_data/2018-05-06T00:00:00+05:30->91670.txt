Plastic in any form or of any quality is harmful to health, period. In a perfect world you would want to avoid exposure to all forms of plastic. Considering plastic lurks in every nook and corner of our lives, banishing it completely seems unrealistic and impractical.

 But we can start with more awareness about the little ways with which we can reduce our exposure to plastic. This can go a long way in reducing toxicity,  ,  ,  ,  , obesity and  . 
 
 Here are some practical and handy solutions that can help you gradually do away with plastic from your life. 
  
 - Discard plastic bottles at home and switch to glass, clay, stainless steel or copper bottles. If you are travelling and have access to only bottled mineral water (which is plastic), carry your own non-plastic bottle so that you can transfer the water. 
 
 - If you have plastic water filters, make a change and switch to matkas or clay pots. They are perfect for summer and naturally purify the water too.
  
 - Traditional India ate out of stainless steel, copper, metal, banana leaf, clay, wooden plates and that’s how it should be. Change your tiffin boxes right now! For kids, stainless steel is safer. At the same time, no matter how true the claim about lunch boxes being microwave safe is, it doesn’t mean it won’t leach chemicals. As we all know, microwaving itself is harmful. 
 
 - Minimise food takeaways and home delivery services because we have no control over the type of plastic they use. Most of the times, restaurants and cafes transfer the food straight from the pan into a plastic container. The amount of toxins and chemicals that leach out from the plastic container into the food is unimaginable. If you have to order food from outside, ask the restaurant the grade of plastic being used. Grade one, four and five are safer than grade three and seven. Grade three and seven are the cheapest and most restaurants use them to save on cost.
 
 - Most organic and farmers’ markets offer dry ration in paper, cartons or cloth bags. But if you are buying groceries from a local shop, transfer all that comes in plastic packets and bottles (eg: cooking oils, dals, spices, rice, flours) into glass, steel or clay jars as soon as it reaches your kitchen. If you purchase something bottled in glass, clean it and reuse it. 
 
 - Avoid drinking hot liquids in styrofoam cups or plastic cups. When hot liquid goes into them there are chemicals being leached into that drink. Instead, opt for bone-china, glass cups, mason jars or bring your own cup. 
 
 - Believe it or not there is plastic in some of your clothes too. The so-called ‘wrinkle free’ fabrics are not safe and contain Teflon, which is a kind of plastic. Organic and natural fabrics like cotton, wool and linen may be the safest options when it comes to your health. This is also why Teflon-coated non-stick cookware should be banned in your kitchen. 
 
 While ordering food from a restaurant, make sure to ask the grade of plastic being used. Grade 1, 4 and 5 are safer than grade 3 and 7. Grade 3 and 7 is the cheapest plastic and restaurants use them to save on cost.
