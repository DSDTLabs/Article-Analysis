BHOPAL:   Medical Officers’ Association ( ) on Wednesday decided to support the 200 doctors who have resigned. The in-service doctors demand reversal of changes to PG counselling rules that rendered them ineligible for preferential seat allotment.

 MPMOA president Dr DK Goswami said, “If these doctors have resigned and the government accepts their resignations then it will have an adverse effect on health services. We urge the government to take a lenient view on the new counselling rules.”
 
 MPMOA members will hold a 30-minute pen-down strike and wear black bands to from Thursday, he added. “Doctors who have resigned will not return to work until our demands are met,” said Dr  , one of the leaders of the protest. Another 30 doctors have sent their resignations, he said.
 
 A DME official said that counselling is nearly over the doctors’ demand is unjustified. “It is up to the health department to take action on them,” he said.
 
 Round-two of PG counselling is underway and the protesting doctors are fighting against time to gain admission under quota for serving in remote areas. Earlier, seats were reserved for doctors serving in 339 remote blocks. However, last year a court directed change in rules and left it to the state to mark which locations were remote. Only 89 blocks were selected and doctors serving in these areas are eligible for 42 PG seats. 
 
 “The doctors should have approached DME ahead of finalisation of rules. Government gave only 48 hours for public review. As of now we expect the government to revert to old norms, otherwise it would adversely affect health services,” said Dr Goswami.
