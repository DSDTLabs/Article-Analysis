JODHPUR: The scientific community, working on technologies in the fields of low carbon desalination and water purification, has called for a ‘centre for excellence’ to address the broad spectrum of research, development and deployment of technologies in the sector.

 At the two-day national conference on ‘Desalination and Water Purification for Defence and Civil Applications’, held at the  , participants discussed techniques that have potential to address growing challenges on water-related issues for both defence and civil applications.
 
 Drawing attention to world water crisis, P K Tewari, Bhabha   Research Center ( ) scientist and president of the   (IDA), said that the annual water demand, which was 800 billion cubic metres (BCM) in 2010, was set to shoot up to 1,500 BCM by 2050.
 
 This was more than the utilizable and internally renewable water resources available in the country, estimated currently to be 1,200 BCM.
 
 “Amid this scenario, there is greater need for further research in the field of low carbon desalination and water purification techniques, which would help to bring carbon footprint down, make water technology more affordable and address environmental concerns,” Tewari said at the conference which concluded on Thursday.
