Although it is quite routine for actors to get a hip title from co-actors and fans, Rana Daggubati hadn’t got a cool name for himself so far. But after showcasing mesmerizing acting skills in his latest flick 'Ghazi,' he has earned a new name, ‘War Star!'

 
 With macho performances in most of his films like Rudhramadevi, Baahubali and Ghazi, all of which had a war back drop, Tollywood’s handsome hunk certainly deserves the cool title, opine his fans. 
 
 
 
 Rana’s upcoming bilingual film directed by Satyasiva that is about Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s INA will again display a few war sequences and would add on to his ‘War Star’ image.
