VADODARA: The M&V Patel Department of Electrical Engineering of CS Patel Institute of Technology of Changa-based Charotar University of Science and Technology (Charusat) has bagged a collaborative research project from  , the United Kingdom, under the Newton-Bhabha Fund. 

 The project is an industry-academia collaboration to address system wide impacts of renewable energy sources in engineering programme. 
 
 Apart from Charusat, the UK’s  , Uttar Gujarat Vij Company Ltd and Vadodara-based   are the collaborators in the project. 
 
 Around Rs 76 lakh has been sanctioned for the project for a period of two years. 
 
 “The project has been sanctioned to enhance engineering education for Indian universities with the help of academic experts from the UK,” said Dr Pragnesh Bhatt, professor and head of the department, adding that knowledge sharing activities will be planned through faculty exchange programme between Charusat and Cardiff University.
 
 “The project will be helpful in enhancing industry input in engineering curricula and educational practice in Charusat as well as other Indian universities to improve imparting of practical engineering skills and increasing graduate employability,” he said. 
 
 “We are going to develop a laboratory which can show the working principle of power generation using renewable energy sources. Another objective is to study the effect of renewable energy sources on the performance of institution network in terms of losses and voltage profile,” he said. 
 
 “The laboratory will also provide hands-on training to students to clearly understand the functions of power generation through renewable energy,” he added.
