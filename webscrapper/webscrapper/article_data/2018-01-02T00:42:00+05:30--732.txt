Criticising actor Rajinikanth’s decision to enter politics, minister for information and publicity Kadambur C Raju said that many actors have entered politics thinking that they could be successful like renowned actor and former chief minister MG Ramachandran. “But they vanished into thin air,” the minister added.

 Raju was talking to reporters at Kovilpatti near Tuticorin on Monday evening. He said that Rajinikanth did not know the meaning of the word system. “He has been reiterating the statement that the system is wrong for a year. But so far he has not said what system is wrong,” he said and added that dravidian parties will not be affected if the actor floats his own party. “Tamil Nadu is dravidian land. Only dravidian parties will rule the state. Other parties have no job,” he said.
