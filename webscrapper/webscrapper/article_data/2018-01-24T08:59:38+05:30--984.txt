NAGPUR: Shrikrishna  , 35, ailing from  , was booked under non-cognizable sections after he ransacked the family court on Tuesday following a heated discussion with his lawyer.

 Family sources said Shrivas, who earn a livelihood as security guard, was unhappy with his lawyer, whom he had paid after mortgaging his sister’s earrings. He had come to attend a date but was told by the lawyer to return on January 30. Shrivas, who had already fired his first lawyer, was also angry as there was no relief for him for the last five years, since he and his wife   had filed cases against each other over marital disputes and maintenance.
 
 It is also learnt that another reason for Shrivas to lose his temper had been that the court has provided his wife with free legal services. Shrivas wanted to know why he was being told to come repeatedly while his wife never turned up. His mother   said Shrivas’s wife had deserted him within two months of their marriage.
 
 During lunch hour on Tuesday, there was a heated argument between Shrivas and his lawyer. His lawyer also wanted to leave the case, which led to the face off. The upset Shrivas started throwing files and furniture around, until the cops on court security duty were summoned. The cops took Shrivas to   police station, where he was strictly warned before being let off. He has been summoned again on Wednesday.
 
 “No one from court came to file a complaint. The cops filed a report of his going berserk,” said a police source.
