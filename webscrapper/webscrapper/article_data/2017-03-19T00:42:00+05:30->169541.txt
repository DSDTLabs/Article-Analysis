Jaipur: Head to Gate 3, Central Park, if you are interested in learning more about the common sparrow. March 20 is World   Day. On Sunday and Monday this year, the group that has been active in making Jaipur safe for this little bird will be selling sparrow nest boxes and educating children on the habits of sparrows. The event will begin at 7 am and end by 10 am.

 Last year too, a similar event was held to mark World Sparrow Day at Central Park. Since 2014, hundreds of nest boxes have been sold, and city schoolchildren have taken the lead in making it safe for the bird to breed. A booklet on the sparrow brought out by students of Maharani Gayatri Devi School will also be on sale at the event.
 
 According to environmentalist Harsh Vardhan who has been among the leaders of the initiative, about 8,300 new sparrows have taken flight in the city since 2014, when the first nest boxes were distributed. 
 
 Sparrows do not nest on trees, and have long evolved to live alongside human beings, nesting in the crevices of buildings. However, with modern buildings sporting a slick exterior and using a lot of glass in construction, the sparrows are left with fewer habitable buildings. Although the bird is still quite common in Jaipur, it is getting to be a rarer and rarer sight in many large cities of the country.
