HYDERABAD: Traffic jams and bottleneck on one of Hyderabad’s busiest roads are likely to be resolved with authorities firming up plans to build a steel bridge on Road Number 3, Banjara  , near the busy Nagarjuna circle.

 
  
 A decades-old graveyard, which is a major hurdle for any road expansion and smooth flow of traffic between Jubilee Hills Checkpost and Panjagutta, Begumpet, Mehdipatnam and other areas, would be acquired soon.
 
 “There are no bottlenecks between TV9 Junction and a pylon abutting MJ College, but from the pylon to Chutneys, a 1,700 square metre stretch, becomes narrow. This stretch will be required for widening,”   ( ) executive engineer, traffic & transportation, Venkat Reddy told TOI.
 
 Road-users, especially office-goers, have a harrowing time negotiating the bottleneck and overcoming traffic congestion on the stretch. With cars speeding at night, accidents on the narrow stretch are common.
 
 The existing road is five-seven metres wide. In the new plan, the authorities have decided to widen it to a three-lane road and increase its width to 12 metres.
 
 The GHMC and the traffic & transport (T&T) wing have already conducted a detailed survey between the pylon and Chutneys. Thereafter, they prepared a plan to widen the road.
 
 Governor ESL Narasimhan and chief minister   travel on this stretch regularly.
 
 B Srikanth, a techie who stopped taking this route to his house at Marredpally, said the move would get him back on the stretch soon. “This is a right move and we are all happy about it,” he added.
