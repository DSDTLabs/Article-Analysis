New Delhi: Four people were arrested on Monday for using a   to solve questions for   candidates.

 The men, including the owner of a computer centre, used to give the candidate a terminal with the software that could be accessed by a remote, and then connect it with the terminal of the person who would solve the questions. Three of the men, Anoop, Neeraj and Kushal Negi, were employees of another computer centre in Patparganj that had a contract with SSC to hold the exams. They were caught at Patparganj Industrial Area. The fourth accused, Durej Ali, was arrested in Badarpur.
 
 Joint commissioner (crime) Alok Kumar said, “A team led by DCP Rajesh Deo established the roles of the four men after analysing the contact list of another accused caught earlier in north Delhi”.
 
 The four men admitted to being part of a syndicate that had been operating in many parts of the country. So far, they had solved the papers for about 200 students of different batches. It was found that the members of the syndicate had connived with the private operator who was given a contract by SSC to conduct the exam. He used to leak the question paper to selected students. The exam is conducted in three phases—preliminary, main and interview (only for gazetted posts). 
 
 The students who enrolled with this syndicate got clearance till the main exam, which guaranteed them a government job. Police have found some registers with the names of the students who were enrolled and will question them as well. Members of the joint team have been conducting raids in parts of north   from where the syndicate operated.
