PANAJI: The   group has asked its management staff of around 800 to resign from the company in view of the uncertainty in the state’s mining sector.   source said that the company has only asked employees who can find jobs elsewhere to resign, and hasn’t touched the workers. “We have had discussions with managment over the past two months,” the source said. “We cannot limit their career by asking them to remain in Goa when career prospects are limited.”

 Sources in the mining industry expect a lot of changes in the sector within the coming week. Just last month, Sesa  , a Vedanta group company, asked all its employees not to report to work with immediate effect. Sources said that Vedanta has started transferring its management staff to their other units outside the state.
 
 In a communication to its employees, Sesa had said that it is beyond the control of the company to “continue the operations of the mines considering the   judgment” and instructions from the state government.
 
 
 
 “H ence, all employees have been advised not to report duty at mines with immediate effect until further notice,” the company said. On February 7, the Supreme Court quashed the renewal of 88 mining leases and directed the state to shut down mining activities from March 15 and renew the leases in accordance with the law.
