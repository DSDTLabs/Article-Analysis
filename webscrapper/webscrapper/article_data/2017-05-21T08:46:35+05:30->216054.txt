HYDERABAD: Concerned over increasing incidents of vehicles crashing into   pillars and the loss of lives, the   along with the   and the city police will soon launch an awareness and education campaign on safe driving practices.On May 10, AP minister P Narayana's son and another person were killed when a car he was reportedly driving at over 200 kmph slammed into a Metro Rail pillar in  . "The focus of our campaign will be on creating awareness on safe driving and not on blaming anyone. We have been in discussions with the city police and GHMC officials on safety measures on the roads along the Metro Rail viaducts," HMRL managing director   said.

 :Our concessionaire, L&T, has been instructed to install appropriate signage on the pillars and along the Metro Rail route to make road users aware of safety while driving on the road," Reddy said.
 
 Metro Rail pillars have been designed to withstand the impact of such crashes and this was evident in recent crashes when no dent could be seen on the pillars although vehicles involved weighed over a tonne. A 3.3-foot tall crash barrier that juts out a few inches can be seen on most pillars and they take any impact of a crash. "Nowadays, many powerful vehicles capable of high speeds are on the city roads. Even the ORR is not designed to take vehicles driving at 200 kmph. The roads in the city are designed for a maximum speed of 65 kmph," Reddy said. Once all pillars are constructed and the viaduct above carrying the rails is done, the median connecting the pillars on the road will be constructed. As per National Highway Authority's standards, such medians should be restricted to a height of a foot. "We will also beautify the median," Reddy said.
