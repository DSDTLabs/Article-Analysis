SHILLONG: A local court issued an arrest   for absconding Independent MLA  , wanted in connection with a case of sexual exploitation of a 14-year-old girl. 

 The chief judicial magistrate, Shillong, issued the warrant against Dorphang, legislator from the Mawhati constituency, who is supporting the ruling Congress in the state. Dorphang is also the founder-chairman of the outlawed Khasi militant outfit, Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council.
 
 Police have begun their search for the legislator, traceless after being booked for his alleged role in sexually exploiting and trafficking the minor, East Khasi Hills SP M Kharkrang said.
 
 The case was registered at the Laitumkhrah police station in the city and Dorphang was booked under Section 366 (A) of the IPC read with Section 3 (a)/4 of the POCSO Act and under Section 5 of the Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act (ITPA).
 
 The case came to light last month after a waiter at a state house owned by   home minister HDR Lyngdoh's son was arrested for allegedly trafficking the victim.
