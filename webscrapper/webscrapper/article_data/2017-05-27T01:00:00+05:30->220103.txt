When   set out to make the animation film, ' ', she was faced with a daunting task: the writer-director had to choose her lead character’s look from over 20 options. After shortlisting four, she asked her co-producers   and  , to get some children from Mumbai and Delhi to pick the final design.

 Ruchi explains, “Usually, actors are cast based on their market appeal, but since ours is an animation film, I decided to let the audience do the casting. I was surprised to see how clear the children were about their preferences. The final design has got a 97 per cent rating from them. They gave feedback on everything, from costumes and jewellery to the postures of the character. We have incorporated all of it while creating  , the star of our film.”
 
 That’s not all; the makers have also borrowed the children’s lingo while penning the dialogues. 
 
 Ruchi reveals, “When the kids saw the design of Garud, their reaction was ‘Wow!’. When Maruti first sees Garud on screen, his reaction is also the same. Similarly, we have used words like ‘fattey’ for fantastic. Language is organic and keeps changing, so we wanted to evolve with the current generation.”
