CHENNAI: They didn't just run the 26-mile   last Sunday - they decided to run to it as well. Last weekend, Chennai-based runners   and Vipul Kumar decided to run 26 hours at a stretch from  , right up to the starting point of the trail marathon in Auroville.

 And once they got there, well, they just ran the entire marathon. And when they were done with that, well, the two decided to jump into a nearby quarry lake for an hour of swimming... just to relax.
 
 No wonder their ultra run is being hailed as inspirational, the feat doing the rounds on social media websites. Van Geit and Kumar say they did it to inspire people to exercise.
 
 “We ran around 190km over two days,“ says Van Geit, 44, who works with CISCO systems and is the founder of the Chennai Trekking Club. “We got started on the night of Friday , February 10, and ran all through Saturday . We reached Auroville on Sunday , two hours before the marathon was to begin. So we took a pow er nap and then laced up again,“ says Geit.
 
 “The initial plan was to cycle there,“ says Kumar, 26, who works with Amazon. “But many people do that, so we figured we'd give running a shot.“
 
 “We ran both on East Coast Road and through the interior roads and paddy fields as we wanted to explore the landscape as well,“ says Van Geit, who adds that the two of them would stop under trees in the every few hours for a short nap or to eat.
 
 Kumar says when cars bearing runners heading to Auroville would see the two of them running at night, they would stop and ask if they wanted a lift to the venue.
 
 “When they realised what we were doing they cheered us on,“ says Kumar, who adds that their run seems to have inspired others to give it a shot.
 
 “We thought that running on the plains would be easy but the heat made it extremely challenging,“ says Kumar.“But that's what we wanted, a challenge, to show it's all possible, if you train, if you run, if you just tell yourself you want to do it,“ says Geit.
