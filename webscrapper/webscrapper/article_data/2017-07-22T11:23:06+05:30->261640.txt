Mirror had earlier reported (June 29) about Reema Kagti's sports drama, ' ', kicking off in Bradford. Now we hear, a few days into the shoot   met with an unfortunate incident but sailed through it with some help from his friends.

  
  
 A source from the sets reveals, "While at the shoot, the actor realised his wallet that contained all his cards and cash was missing. When he informed his friends, they immedately helped him out. A few days later, wife Naina Bachchan, joined him at the location. The actor has since returned to India."
 
 We contacted both   and his spokesperson and both chose not to comment. The Farhan Akhtar-Ritesh Sidhwani production is inspired by the story of the Indian hockey team's historic win, bagging the first Olympic medal for the country as a free nation in 1948. It is slated for an Independence Day release in 2018.
