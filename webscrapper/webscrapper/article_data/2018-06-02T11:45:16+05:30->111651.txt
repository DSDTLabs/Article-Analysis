PANAJI: The   on Friday filed a complaint with Goa police expressing apprehensions that certain individuals could be impersonating chief minister Manohar   while clearing government files or according approvals for proposals. 

 In the complaint filed with the crime branch, the Congress has said that it had its doubts whether Parrikar was clearing files through e-mails or whether some other individuals were using his account to fraudulently clear government files.
 
 The Congress said its concerns were based on a letter written by Parrikar dated February 28 wherein he wrote that he had been asked by his doctors to avoid touching files due to the possibility of contracting secondary infection. If Parrikar was not allowed to touch physical files, then it was unlikely he would be allowed to use smartphones and laptops, the complaint said. “In these circumstances, there is a grave suspicion as regards to whether the CM is sending the e-mails or the same are being sent by some other individuals using his account... for larger financial gains by certain individuals,” Congress spokesperson   stated in his complaint.
