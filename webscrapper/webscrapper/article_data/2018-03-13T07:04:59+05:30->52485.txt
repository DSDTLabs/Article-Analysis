HYDERABAD: Visiting government veterinary clinics in the city has become a daunting task for hundreds of pet owners, courtesy the extremely unhygienic conditions prevalent in these facilities. Not only do owners complain about medical waste strewn all over the clinics but also rue how all procedures are done on unclean surgical tables.

 
 “Even without even wiping it after a procedure, the pets are put on the table. It is so bad that pet owners literally need to carry their own linen. They don’t even have a proper dustbin in the hospital. All the syringes and cotton that’s used to clean blood and other medical waste is simply dumped in a corner near the entrance of the hospital,” said a dog owner,   who recently visited the Government Veterinary Hospital at Kukatpally.
  
 
 
 The situation isn’t very different in the other government-run facilities. And a surge in cases of pyrvo virus — a life threatening infection — being reported from the city, has only added to the distress levels of owners. “Your pet is more likely to acquire new infections and disease in this veterinary clinic, than healing from the ones it already has. My neighbour’s dog too was taken there and later was found to have pyrvo virus which is contagious (spreads from dog to dog),” said another pet owner,  , who recently went to a clinic at  
 
 
 But given the steep fee charged by private clinics, owners are often caught in a fix and left with no choice but to opt for these government facilities. “I have three pets at home and each visit to a  , even if it is just for a general check-up, costs at least Rs 700- Rs 1000, and can go up to Rs 5000-Rs 10,000. It becomes pretty expensive for pet owners, especially if they have more than one. It is not always possible to visit private facilities,” said B Varsha.
