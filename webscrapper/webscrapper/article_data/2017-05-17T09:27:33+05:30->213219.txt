 Speaking to mediapersons in Madurai on Tuesday, Chellappa said that though they had also signed affidavits for the merger of the two factions, it now seemed impractical as they were the stronger group, which had the backing of majority of the cadres. The merger committee, headed by R Vaidylingam had not moved forward since its constitution two months ago, and definitely did not seem to have any powers, he said.
