Vadodara: The Technology Teachers Forum (TTF) of M S University’s Faculty of Technology and Engineering (FTE) on Thursday threatened that all the teachers of the faculty will stay away from exam duties. 

 TTF in a letter to MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas said around 20 teachers have received showcause notices from the examination department seeking their explanations on the alleged mistakes in preparation of results. TTF said many of these exams were taken a couple of years back and the results were also rectified later but the exam section has taken the extreme path of issuing showcause notices. 
 
 “If the university does not withdraw the notices, we will have no option but to stay away from all exam work,” said TTF secretary Dr A S Mohite.
