KOLKATA: A   from   has been flooded with   from five different numbers over the last month, being threatened with   if he did not pay Rs 2 crore. Though he initially ignored the calls, he became wary since December 31, 2016, as certain statements by the callers since then have made him suspect he was being monitored. 

 Not surprising, he reported the matter to the detective department, which is certain that the calls were being made by a Bihar-based gang, operating outside the state. “We are trying to develop certain leads in this case,” said joint CP (crime and STF) Vishal Garg.
 
 Two other businessmen, one from New Alipore and the other Salt Lake, had also lodged similar complaints about being threatened for Rs 2 crore each, around the same time. The police suspect all the three calls were made by the same gang, based out of Siwan district in Bihar.
 
 In fact, barely a couple of months ago, the New Alipore police zeroed in on a dreaded extortionist, Srikanta Yadav, for calling up another businessman from New Alipore and demanding Rs 10 lakh from him. The police traced the call to Yadav, who was already inside a jail, serving a term for a murder. Two mobiles—one belonging to Yadav and another to his cell mate Pawan Tiwari—were recovered a few weeks ago. “It is strange that despite checks and installing jammers in jails, such calls are continuing unabated. We are taking him in remand to check why he made such a call,” said a senior investigating officer, hinting Yadav’s gang could be behind threatening the three businessman from Shakespeare Sarani, New alipore and Salt Lake as they had earlier kidnapped a South 24-Parganas businessman for  .
