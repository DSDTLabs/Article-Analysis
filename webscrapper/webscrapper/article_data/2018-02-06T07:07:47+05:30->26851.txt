CHANDIGARH: A   here on Monday upheld a lower court order in a property dispute worth Rs 20,000 crore between two sisters of Faridkot royalty, maharaja’s nephew and a trust. The court of additional district and sessions judge Ajit Atri dismissed the appeal filed by the   and a nephew of late Harinder Singh, the last maharaja, which was declared ‘illegal and void’ by the lower court in 2013, on Monday.

 The appeals were moved in the court of the additional district and sessions judge by Amrit Kaur, daughter of Harinder Singh, nephew of Harinder Singh and Maharawal Khewaji Trust against the order of a trial court of chief judicial magistrate in August 2013.
 
 According to the August 2013 order, two daughters of the former maharaja of Faridkot Amrit Kaur and Deepinder Kaur were granted inheritance of assets worth Rs 20,000 crore . But this was challenged by late maharaja’s nephew   by arguing that the former ruler’s will was illegal and void. Bharatinder then staked claim to the property, citing the ‘Rule of Primogeniture’, according to which property rights were granted to the first born son or eldest living male blood relative.
 
 After a two-decade long battle, the former ruler’s two daughters were granted inheritance to assets including the   at Copernicus Marg near India Gate, palace and   in Faridkot, properties in Mashobra (Shimla), besides bank deposits, jewellery and vintage cars, including a Rolls Royce.
