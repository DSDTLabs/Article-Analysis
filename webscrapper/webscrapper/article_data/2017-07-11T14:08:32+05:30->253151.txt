PATNA: Devotees thronged the temples in the city on the first Monday of the holy month of Shrawan, and paid obeisance to Lord Shiva amid chants of ‘Har Har Mahadev’ and ‘Jai Bhole Nath’ even as it rained cats and dogs.

 This fifth month of Hindu calendar is dedicated to Lord Shiva and Mondays are considered by Hindus as the most auspicious days during the month. Devotees observe fast as part of ‘Somvari vrat’ rituals and pray to Lord Shiva for the welfare of their family.
 
 Shrawan this year will have five Mondays. “Lord Shiva fulfils the wishes of his followers during the month of Shrawan,” said Umesh Kumar Dwivedi, priest of the   at Boring Road roundabout.
 
 The rush of devotees continued till late in the evening when the temples organised ‘maha-arti’. “Fasting and prayers give me inner strength,” said sexagenarian Shanti Devi who claimed to have been observing ‘Somvari’ fast since she was 16. “By the grace of Lord Shiva, I have a happy family,” said the Ashiana Nagar homemaker who would break her fast after taking a bath and performing puja at the Shiva Temple at Ramnagari on Tuesday.
 
 Lovely Sharma said she started doing ‘Somvari vrat’ after her marriage. “I fast only on first and last Monday as I have to manage a hectic office schedule,” she added.
