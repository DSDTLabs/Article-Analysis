New Delhi: North Delhi Municipal Corporation, following the footsteps of its southern counterpart, is now asking hotels and restaurants under its jurisdiction to let common people use their  .

 A meeting between senior officials of the civic body and industry representatives was held on Tuesday evening at the civic centre on Minto Road. “During the meeting, we asked owners of such establishments to let common people use their toilets. We also gave them option to adopt public restrooms located near their facility,” said   commissioner, P K Gupta.
 
 NDMC currently operates 1,163 urinals out of which only 41 are ladies toilets. The civic body had also built 318 waterless urinals but the project failed. Most of these facilities are poorly maintained and several NGOs have pointed out that they fail to pass even the minimum standards.
 
 According to senior officials, north corporation has more than 10,000 hotels, guest rooms and restaurants and the move will bring immense relief to common public. “Our action will be at a much larger scale as we have large number of tourist attractions, market places and hotels. Paharganj alone has over 2,500 such establishments. A large number of people from all over the country come to New and Old Delhi Railway station which will have significant impact providing relief to lakhs of people.”
 
 With hotel and guest room hubs in areas like Paharganj, Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh, the scale of the restrooms availability will increase tenfold from the current 1,000 odd urinals to over 10,000.
 
 Sources said that it was LG Anil Baijal’s idea to make washrooms at restaurants and hotels more accessible for the public.
