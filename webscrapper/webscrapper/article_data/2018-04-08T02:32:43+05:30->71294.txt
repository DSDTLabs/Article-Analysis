NOIDA: Parents of children studying in private   in Noida and   have questioned the effectiveness of the   that the government is planning to bring next week for the current session, saying most institutions have already hiked fees that have to be cleared in a few days. 

 The last date for paying the first quarter of fees is April 10 in most schools, the parents said, adding that a majority of them had cleared them. The parents said the fees had been hiked by at least 10% on an average.
 
 The ordinance says that fee other than that for admission and tuition will be charged only if the children avail of the facility. The parents, however, said many of the private schools like Mayoor, Ryan International, Sapphire International, Billabong and   had been charging them under heads such as performing arts, students welfare, sick bay, report card and so on.
 
 The fee structure of a Class I student of a private school revealed that the institution had hiked its quarterly fee by 11.28% and annual fee by 7.40%.
 
 “A group of parents had on Wednesday protested against the fee   and demanded that no fee be collected until there is clarity on the UP Self-Financed Schools (fixation of fee) ordinance. When the parents insisted on meeting the principal of a particular school, she met four of them and agreed to seek approval from the central office on our demand,” said a parent.
 
 Most principals said they would only after the ordinance comes into effect.
