PANAJI: The stateâ€™s deficient solid waste management programme is looking up, as the government has prodded more defiant panchayats into the garbage-collection loop and raised the quantum of garbage delivered at   plant to over 100 tonne in January 2018.

 With a full-fledged   (GWMC) functioning from August 1, 2017, more than 25 panchayats joined the other performing bodies in initiating door to door collection. The setting up of the corporation had itself been delayed for almost a decade after the 2009 bill to achieve the objective fizzled out.
 
 Now, the quantum of waste received at the Saligao garbage treatment plant has doubled from 51.2 tonnes in January 2017 to 113.3 tonnes in January 2018, though a part of it is mixed waste.
 
 For over a decade, most panchayats have been flouting the orders of the high court of Bombay at Goa to set up systems for collection of dry garbage and composting facilities for biodegradable waste.
