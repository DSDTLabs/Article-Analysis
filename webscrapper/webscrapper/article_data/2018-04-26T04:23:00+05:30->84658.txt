Vadodara: A child help desk dedicated to the railway station was inaugurated in the city on Wednesday. Baroda Citizens Council (BCC) started the second such help desk with the help of Ministry of Women and Child Development. The idea behind launching the help desk is to help children in distress. BCC officials said that the help desk will counsel children facing problems and also work on missing child reports apart from sexual abuse of kids. The help desk located near the railway protection force (RPF) centre was inaugurated by city police commissioner, Manoj Sashidhar and Devendra Kumar, divisional railway manager.  The help desk has a team of 12 people including seven team members, three volunteers, one counsellor and one project co-ordinator who will counsel and rehabilitate the child rescued by the railway police. The BCC help desk in the city usually gets 2,000 calls per month.
