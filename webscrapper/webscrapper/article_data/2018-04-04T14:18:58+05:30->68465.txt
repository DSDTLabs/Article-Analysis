SURAT: Around 50 parents demanded action against authorities at L P Savani Academy, Vesu, who had issued letters of suspension to a few students who had failed to pay complete school fees in the last academic year.

 The parents made an angry representation over the issue at the office of the district education officer (DEO) at   in   on Tuesday. Police had to be called by the DEO because the parents refused to leave his office without getting a satisfactory reply. Police forced them to leave the office premises even as the DEO gave an assurance that he will seek a reply from the school about its decision to suspend admission of the students and forward it to the   (CBSE) for action.
 
 A number of parents started receiving notices on their mobile phones about suspension of their child’s admission from L P Savani Academy, Vesu, since Monday. The admissions were suspended of those students who had not paid complete fees for the last academic year. 
 
 The parents discussed the issue with DEO U N   and demanded action against the school. “We informed the DEO about the notices of suspension issued to parents through the mobile app. Why schools are mounting pressure on parents to pay fees when the matter is sub judice?” asked a parent. “The parents who fought against collection of higher fees by schools for several months trusting that the state government would help them are in a quandary. The state government has disappointed the parents,” another parent said.
 
 “The school is affiliated to CBSE and hence we cannot directly take any action until the court gives its final order on the matter. I have asked the school to give us details of the suspension of students which I plan to forward to the CBSE,” Rathod told TOI.
