BENGALURU: With infighting beginning to take a toll on BJP’s image in Karnataka, the party’s central leadership on Sunday sacked four office-bearers from both the warring factions headed by BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa and leader of the opposition in the legislative council K S Eshwarappa.
 
 Those sacked are party vice-presidents Bhanuprakash and Nirmal Kumar Surana from the Eshwarappa camp and vice president (raitha morcha) MP Renukacharya and spokersperson G Madhusudhan from the Yeddyurappa camp.
  
 The marching orders were given by state BJP general secretary N Ravi Kumar following a directive from the party’s head-honchos in New Delhi.
  
 “The message is loud and clear: Stop fighting within the party and work collectively in the run-up to the 2018 assembly polls,” a senior BJP leader told The Times of India.
  
 In fact, the BJP had witnessed an internal strife when Eshwarappa faction organized a public meeting recently to criticize Yeddyurappa for his authoritarian style of functioning. 
  
 In the meeting, Eshwarappa and his supporters had slammed Yeddyurappa for his alleged dictatorial approach and appealed to the national leadership to intervene.
  
 Yeddyurappa retorted by calling the meeting an "anti-party activity" and alleged that the Eshwarappa faction was being backed by BJP national joint secretary (organization) Santosh.
  
 With both the factions pointing finger at each other in public, the national leadership chose to crack the whip by sacking the four office-bearers of the party.
