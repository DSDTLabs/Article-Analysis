COIMBATORE: Minutes before the   pronounced its verdict against   general secretary V K Sasikala, two more   from the district joined the Panneerselvam camp on Tuesday morning. With this, the number of MLAs supporting chief minister   from the district has gone up to three. 

 Periyanaickenpalayam MLA and AIADMK urban district general secretary P R G Arun Kumar and   MLA O K Chinnaraj met Panneerselvam on Tuesday morning and offered their support to him.
 
 While it is believed that the decision to move to OPS camp was taken foreseeing the verdict against Sasikala, the elected representatives attribute their decision to the public sentiment. “I received several messages from the people of my constituency (Mettupalayam). They all wanted me to support Panneerselvam. At the same time, the ground-level cadres too believed that OPS will be the right person to lead the party and the state,” Chinnaraj said.
 
 The second-time MLA from Mettupalayam said he does not worry about party positions nor is hungry for power. “I am not bothered about the consequences. I believe that my decision is right,” said Chinnaraj. Arun Kumar was unavailable for comment.
 
 Meanwhile, Kavundamapalayam MLA V C Arukutty urged rural development and municipal administration minister S P Velumani and other seven MLAs from Coimbatore to render support to Panneerselvam.
 
 Speaking to TOI at his residence in Vilankurichi, Arukutty said, "I urge local minister S P Velumani and other local MLAs to join Panneerselvam. I hope that other MLAs who are still kept captive at the Golden Bay Resort in Koovathur should also join us.” Velumani was elected from Thondamuthur constituency in Coimbatore.
