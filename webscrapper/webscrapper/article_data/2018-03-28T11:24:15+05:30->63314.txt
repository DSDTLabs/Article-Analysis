PANAJI: A resident of   has constructed a structure that encroaches onto an internal village road, leading to narrowing of the public road. Following repeated complaints from villagers over the past two years, deputy director of panchayats for North Goa, Chandrakant Shetkar, directed the block development officer for   to demolish the encroachment.

 Residents say that despite the order issued in January this year, the structure is yet to be torn down, and they fear it will be converted into a permanent structure by the encroacher in the meantime.
 
 “There is a road 10m wide, but the person has encroached on the road at least by four meters,” said complainant  . “This makes it very difficult for other local residents to pass through the narrow road left.”
 
 Based on the complaint, the Chimbel panchayat issued a showcause notice to the person last year, stating that the panchayat, on carrying out a site inspection, found that the encroachment structure has been constructed illegally without permission from the local body. The deputy director of panchayats has now asked the   to act.
