Bathinda: The seven farm organizations demanding complete agri loan wavier have accused the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government of trying to suppress their struggle. In a joint statement, the farmer organizations on Thursday said that though the Congress government tried to crush their protest by arresting hundreds of activists, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday gave a go-ahead to their agitation. The court has told the farm bodies to select a location in consultation with Patiala deputy commissioner, they said.

 Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri said though Amarinder made a score of promises before the assembly elections, including complete farm debt waiver, and also asked farmers not to commit suicides due to mounting financial burden, in reality   have increased in the last six months.
 
 He said their counsel handed over a list to high court explaining that 169 farmers had committed suicide in Punjab from April 1 to September 9. He said after such high number of suicides, the government even wanted to snatch their fundamental right to protest but the court had stopped it from doing so.
