MUMBAI: Hyderabad challenger Corfe Castle, Ruffina's full brother (real brother), emulated his sister's act and won the Poonawalla Breeders' Multi-Million (Grade 1) at the   on Sunday. The siblings, born out of Excellent Art (GB)-Miss Danehill (IRE), were bred at  's Greenfield Stud Farm. The winner was trained by jockey-turned trainer Leo D'Silva and guided by jockey  . The winner was available at 7/1. Favourite   finished seventh in an 11-horse field.

 
 After remaining in the last bunch for almost half of the 1400-metre journey, Corfe Castle slipped through the traffic and took charge at the 200-metre mark from home and sailed away for a smooth victory. "I had a sleepless night after my colt had traffic problems and lost to Athenaeus in Hyderabad a month ago. I wanted to avenge that defeat and prove a point. I'm happy my colt did it," trainer D'Silva told TOI after the race. It was the first victory at the Mahalaxmi racecourse for the 58-year-old.
 
 D'Silva was born and brought up in Bandra and attended St Stanislaus School. He went on become a jockey in 1975 before shifting to Bangalore four years later. "Then I again shifted to Hyderabad in 1985. I gave up riding in 1991 and became a trainer," D'Silva said.
 
 With 300 metres to go, Corfe Castle was struggling for an opening but jockey Patel wasn't bothered. "My mount was travelling well. I knew he would fly once he got an opening," the 26-year-old rider said.
