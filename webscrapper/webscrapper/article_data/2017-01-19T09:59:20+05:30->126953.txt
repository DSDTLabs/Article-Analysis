PUNE: The   has decided to construct a second entrance gate at   to  .

 Senior officials of Pune division on Wednesday said development plans for Pune junction were up and running and were aimed at improving passenger amenities. The railways have decided to rope in private companies to modernise 23 railway stations, including Pune.
 
 Divisional railway manager B K Dadabhoy said: “As far as the Pune division of the Central Railway is concerned, we do have some plans for the Pune junction. The area around the station is set to change with the Pune metro project coming up.” The second main entrance to the station will be located just opposite the divisional railway manager’s office. Also, the construction of a new autorickshaw stand was nearing completion, he added.
 
 “The new stand will have a ramp connecting the station’s main building. The existing stand will be dismantled. In addition, a foot overbridge is being built which will connect to a sky walk and further to platform number six. Once the foot overbridge is ready, an escalator will be installed,” Dadabhoy said. 
 
 “The beautification of the 400-metre wall at Solapur-end along platform number one has been initiated in coordination with the forest and wildlife department. Various themes related to forests and wildlife are being painted which will give a fresh look to the station soon,” the senior official said.
 
 Commuter groups, however, felt that the administration was not doing enough. “The railways have lot of land around the station, which has been encroached upon. Nothing is being done to get it back. If the railways gets the land back, Pune station will be among world-class stations. Now, with private parties being roped in, the railways should wake up and do some serious work. Going private is not at all a good idea,” Harsha Shah, chairperson of  , said.
