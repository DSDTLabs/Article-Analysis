Jaipur: The residents of city’s   area on Wednesday submitted a complaint at Bhankrota police station alleging that toxic chemicals were leaking from a cold storage house, leading to irritation in eyes and breathing troubles for people living in the residential area.

 Hanuman Chaudhary, the local sarpanch, informed TOI that ammonium gas was leaking from the cold storage for the past many days. Due to this, residents in nearby areas are being subjected to physical discomforts.
 
 “Many people on Wednesday complained about eye irritation and other problems due to the toxic gas coming from the cold storage. We have requested to the police to shift the cold storage from this place,” he said.
 
 However, the owner of the cold storage denied the allegations. “No toxic gas was released from the cold storage. The residents had earlier objected to a blower that we have. We have all the permissions to this effect,” said Anoop Garg, the owner of the cold storage.
 
 The Bhankrota police said that they have taken the complaint submitted by the residents, and would probe the matter and check the allegations. “The competent authority in these cases is either the pollution control board or the industries department. The police cannot do much,” the police official informed TOI.
 
 Officials of the Rajasthan pollution control board said that no complaint has been made to them and they were not aware of any such incident. “We have not received any complaint from residents so far. If the matter comes to us for consideration, we will look into it,” said the official.
