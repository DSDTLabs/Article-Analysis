INDORE: As part of a drive to reinforce the compulsory helmet rule, city traffic police on Thursday caught over 1,100 motorists without helmets.

 On Thursday, they caught 1,128 riders riding their vehicles without helmets and a total of Rs.2.82 lakh was collected in fines from violators. “We have once again launched a drive to curb motorists from riding without helemts,” said SP (headquarter) Indore, Md  . He said this campaign has been launched after a number of helmet-related violations and increase in road accidents were reported.
 
 Nearly 11 check points were made in and around the city, where traffic personnel kept a check on motorists without helmets. The checkpoints included Madhumilan square, Bengali square, Star square,   square, Radisson square and   square in the east part of the city. Areas in the city’s west included Gangwal Bus Stand, Mhow Naka, Transport Nagar,   Square and Yashwant Road.
 
 Officials said they continue the drive as long as possible. They said motorists, including youngsters, are being targeted as they are among the most frequent violators. This is the third time in six months that authorities conducted this drive.
 
 Riding a two-wheeler without helmets is an offence, as stated in the Motor vehicles Act, and it is surprising that traffic police authorities have to resort to special drives to enforce it rather than penalise violators on a regular basis the year through. Moreover, it has been seen such drives lose steam in a few days.
