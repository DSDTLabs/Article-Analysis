AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday issued a notice to the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University and other authorities concerned in response to a PIL seeking the removal of its vice-chancellor Shivendra Gupta.

 
 Gupta was appointed last year. The student outfit   had staged protests against his appointment then.
 
 The HC has sought a reply over the PIL filed by a senior citizen from Vadodara, Praful Desai, who is seeking direction to remove Gupta claiming that Gupta does not hold requisite qualifications.
 
 In his petition, Desai stated that the primary qualification for the post of the VC is 15 years’ teaching experience at a university system or in a reputed research organization or in an academic organization. Desai says Gupta does not have the teaching experience, not even of one year, in any of these. “These basic criteria is sufficient to prove ineligibility,” the petitioner said.
 
 After issuing the notice, the HC has posted the matter for further hearing on June 20. 
 
 Earlier in April, Bhavesh  , who is a member of senate at Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU), filed an application under the Right to Information (RTI) Act to get information about the educational qualifications of vice-chancellor Shivendra Gupta. 
 
 Rabari, who is a   councillor in   (SMC), had earlier demanded details in a question submitted during the senate meeting of the university. His demand was rejected at the senate meeting held on March 27. The university did not give any specific reason for rejection of the demand. The senator has sought copies of graduation, post-graduation and PhD mark sheets as well as degrees of the vice-chancellor.
