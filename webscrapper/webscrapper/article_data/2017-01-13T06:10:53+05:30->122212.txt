AHMEDABAD:   has a sound base in petrochemicals sector and a big petroleum-refining capacity, besides a good number of ports. This makes the state particularly well-placed to share in the growth in chemical and petrochemical sectors. 

 However, the way forward in these sectors is joint ventures or overseas investment for production of methanol, said  , a US-based research and development consultant. He was speaking on Thursday, the third day of Vibrant Gujarat Summit-2017, at the seminar on the topic ‘Make in Gujarat (Chemicals & Petrochemicals): Leveraging technology for Gujarat’s next leap towards global leadership.’ 
 
 During the seminar, state agriculture and power minister   said that Gujarat, with its friendly atmosphere for investors, has a policy and procedure-based governance. “We have tremendous investment opportunities in chemical and petrochemical sectors as they have been growing rapidly in the state,” Sapariya said. 
 
 Chemical and petrochemical sectors have grown significantly and natural gas production in the Cambay Basin and the state of the art refineries in Jamnagar, Dahej and Hajira are the state’s achievements in the sector, Sapariya said.
 
 Chemical industry in India is ranked sixth globally in output and third in Asia. Gujarat has 62% share of total petrochemicals manufacturing in India and its share in chemical production is 35%. As many as 6500 chemicals are produced by Gujarat-based companies for local and global consumption .
