New Delhi/Kolkata: Prime Minister Narendra   launched a scathing attack on Tuesday at the Mamata Banerjee government describing Monday’s blood-soaked   polls as “murder of democracy”.

 Addressing party workers at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi after the Karnataka results were declared, Modi said the country must take “serious note” of the violence in   where “all leading parties except the one that rules Bengal suffered”.
 
 The Trinamool reacted sharply to the PM’s comment asking him to “control his own party first”. Secretary general Partha Chatterjee said most of the murders and violence was carried out by BJP supporters themselves. 
 
 Modi is scheduled to meet the chief minister at the Viswa Bharati convocation on May 25. PM’s caustic attack on the government for not allowing democracy to thrive in the “great land of Bengal” came a day after the Union home ministry sought a report from the state on the polling-day violence.
 
 Bringing up the reference to the violence during the rural polls Modi said, “The entire country must have watched on television the way democracy was murdered during the panchayat election in Bengal. Democracy was throttled at every stage from filing nomination to the polling day. Ballot boxes were found in ponds…innocent party workers, not only of BJP, were killed. People were bullied.”
 
 The Trinamool Congress was quick to react. “They are dismayed because of not being able to win in Karnataka. Without knowing the details, it does not reflect well on the PM to make such comments. He should know that BJP goons killed 10 Trinamool workers in the Panchayat poll. No BJP worker was killed. On Wednesday repolling in 568 booths. So why is this fake news spreading? Very unfortunate,” Chatterjee hit back.
