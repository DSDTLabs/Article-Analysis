MUMBAI: Parents of   students from state board affiliated schools have been making trips to the book store only to return empty handed as the updated textbooks are yet to hit the markets.

 The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education is upgrading the class IX   this year. “Bookstores say they have no clue when the textbooks will be available. Usually students start coaching for Class IX in the vacation itself because it is a very important year. The board has also done away with general math which means it will be more important for weaker students to use this vacation time,” said a parent. The board has scrapped the general mathematics subject and are revamping the algebra and geometry texts to include a change in difficulty levels and assessment patterns.
 
 However, education officials said that the textbooks will reach the market well before the school reopening date. “We understand that it must have upset coaching institutes or students already starting tuition. But, we have planned everything according to the school reopening day of June 15 and textbooks will be in the market before that,” said an official. The textbooks are expected to be made available in the markets by the first week of June.
