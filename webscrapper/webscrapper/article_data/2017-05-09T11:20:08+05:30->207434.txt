AMRITSAR: Following the footsteps of the SGPC and   with regard to a joint movement to reclaim the land of   in Haridwar (Uttarakhand), the 'jathedars' appointed by the Sarbat Khalsa have also joined the issue. 

 Apprehending a 'conspiracy' by the SGPC and DSGMC to benefit the BJP-led Union government on the issue, the 'jathedars' of the Sarbat Khalsa have warned of a morcha in case both committees agreed to something less than reconstruction of the shrine at its original site. Talking to TOI on Monday, Sarbat Khalsa-appointed 'jathedar' of Takht Damdama Sahib Baljit Singh   said that, "We smell a conspiracy between the SGPC and DSGMC to benefit the BJP-led central government. We have reports that both committees could settle on a small piece of land somewhere near the original site, but we will not let that happen."
 
 Daduwal, who is also chairman of Panthic Sewa Lehar, said that if the Centre could give 100 acres and Rs 500 crore for the construction of Ram Mandir in   then why it was reluctant in giving the original piece of land, where a gurdwara was constructed in memory of Guru  . 
 
 "We have already alerted the sangat (community) on the issue and if both gurdwara management bodies tried to compromise, we are ready for a long-drawn morcha," said Daduwal.
