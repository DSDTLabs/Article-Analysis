Panaji: Despite the fire at the Panaji bus stand complex, operations of the state-run Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited (KTCL) continued to offer services. “The operations went on as usual with little inconvenience to passengers,” a KTCL official told TOI. The bus platforms are at a safe distance from the supermarket. State, interstate buses were operating at a regular pace. Fire and police personnel had drawn a rope barricade to control locals from entering the building complex thereby restricting access to only outside the building. Passengers boarded buses directly from the platform outside the building and alighting at the bus terminus. The Panaji bus stand sees a footfall of 80-85,000 people per day.
