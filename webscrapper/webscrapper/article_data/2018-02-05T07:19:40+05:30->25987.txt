SURAT: Investigation into the racket of pilfering food grains from fair price shops in Surat has revealed that names of several prominent politicians and businessmen were fraudulently inserted into the list of beneficiaries under the   (NFSA) by the racketeers. 

 Among the thousands, who were shown as beneficiaries, include Surat BJP MP Darshana Jardosh, Choryasi BJP MLA   and Vasant Gajera, owner of Laxmi Diamond. Gajera is listed as a beneficiary of NFSA registered in Amreli.
 
  Surat collector, Mahendra Patel, told TOI: "The two fair price shop (FPS) owners have claimed in their statements that neither Darshanaben or Jankhanaben nor their families have purchased the food grains using ration cards from their shops. It looks like the private agencies, which were outsourced work by government to register beneficiaries under NFSA, fraudulently included the names of these prominent people in the list of beneficiaries. These leaders were not aware if food grains were purchased on their card." 
 
  When contacted, Jankhana Patel said, "We have not even seen FPS in our area and never purchased food grains. I was shocked to know that grains were being sold on ration card issued to our family." 
 
  Gajera said, "I am living in Surat for 47 years and there must be a ration card issued in the name of my father in Amreli. No one from my family has ever gone to purchase food grains." 
 
  The police on Sunday arrested two more people -   (52) and Lakshman alias Channu Bhanwarlal Boliwal (35) - taking the total number of arrests to four. They were working with the FPS owners and helped them in running the racket at their shops. Earlier on Friday, police had arrested two FPS owners Babulal Boriwal (53) and   (61). 
 
  The accused were booked under relevant IPC sections for criminal breach of trust and forgery as well as sections of IT Act and Essential
