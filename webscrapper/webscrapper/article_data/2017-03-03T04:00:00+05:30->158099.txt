Surat: A second year physiotherapy student Parthvi and her friend were on their way to Piplod Road on a scooter. Suddenly, a cow came from nowhere and hit their scooter. Both the young girls were thrown off the two-wheeler but escaped with minor injuries. There are at least 15 such accidents daily due to stray cattle in the city. The 2012 census had put the number of stray cattle in the city at 50,000.

 Stray cattle menace is rampant in Vesu, Pal, Adajan, Bharthana, Mota, Puna-Kumbhariya Road, Sarthana and Simada and is assuming a dangerous proportions in the outer parts of the city. 
 
 Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) says in 2015-16 it had impounded nearly 2,000 cattle and collected Rs20 lakh penalty from their owners. So far, in the current year, it has impounded nearly 3,500 cattle and collected Rs 27 lakh penalty from their owners. 
 
 SMC charges penalty of Rs,650 per day, including administrative charges, for the first day and thereafter for all successive days it is Rs 650.
 
 “At least 50 per cent of the impounded cattle are released after their owners pay up the fine whereas the others remain in Panjrapole,” said Dr Praful Mehta, who is in-charge of SMC’s stray cattle catching department. SMC has made registration of cattle mandatory, but most remain unregistered.
 
 Municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said, “I had a meeting with the police commissioner of the city. Now, we will pick up a specific area like Limbayat, Udhna, Vesu etc. and go there under police protection only. Our request is pending with the state government on the issue of allotment of SRP company for security to us.”
