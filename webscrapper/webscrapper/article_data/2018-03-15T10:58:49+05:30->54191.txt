CHANDIGARH: “A Titan is gone, no one on horizon can fill his gap.” This is how   vice-chancellor Prof   remembered renowned physicist  , who passed away on Wednesday at the age of 76. Grover, a physicist himself, first saw Hawking at Cambridge in 1980. 

 Grover said Hawking visited Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) Mumbai, for the STRINGS 2000 meeting. “We listened to his public lecture in   auditorium. He even danced sitting on his wheelchair in west lawns of TIFR on seashore,” he recalled. Grover said ramps had to be made at several places so that he could steer his wheelchair where he wanted to. It was a great experience seeing the living legend move around as a participant scientist in the event, the vice-chancellor said.
 
 In September 2006, Prof  , professor at the physics department of Panjab University, attended Hawking’s talk in a CERN lab. Recalling his talk, Bhatnagar said, “He had a smart wheelchair, which used to work in line with his eye movements. He was going to the next slide and the next line only through his eye movement. There was a censor attached and he also answered a few questions from the audience. But it took him time to answer the questions because he had to compose answers. He composed by selecting words alphabetically, mixing them and making sentences. The chair had an in-built computer, which made the sentence.”
 
 Panjab University’s physics department is also going to organize a talk on the works and contributions of Hawking. “We plan to organise a programme in which eminent speakers from the Tricity and Delhi will elaborate on the work and contributions of Stephen Hawking. We run a programme sponsored by the department of science and technology, under which we will get speakers to talk about Hawking’s works,” said Dr C Nagaraja Kumar, professor at the department of physics, PU.
