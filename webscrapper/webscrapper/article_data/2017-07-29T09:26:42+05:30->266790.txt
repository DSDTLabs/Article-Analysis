KOLKATA: Old buildings in the city continued to crumble on Friday even as the  's buildings department sought help from the Kolkata Police for peaceful evacuation of insecure buildings.

 Two persons -Buddhadeb Pramanik (30) and Basudeb Sasmal (27) -were injured when an asbestos shed and a portion of the wall of a building in Kidderpore crumbled around 2.20am while another house near   collapsed during the day.
 
 Nudged into action by the spate of crashes, civic officials held a meeting with the police at the KMC headquarters on Friday and took stock of their earlier attempts at razing unsafe buildings; it was revealed that they failed most times as tenants of those crumbling houses either refused to move out or went to court against the civic body's evacuation order. This time, the KMC brass requested the top cop to ask their personnel to make boro ugh-wise lists of highly unsafe buildings and hand them over to local civic offices. “We will take police help in moving out the occupants of insecure buildings, especially those facing the threat of collapse. We have asked the police brass to form a team with our buildings department officials and help them in the evacuation drive,“ mayor Sovan Chatterjee said, adding the KMC was now armed with an amended law that would make the task easier.
 
 But the authorities might face hindrance in reconstructing the houses, said some buildings department officials.“We don't have the means to put up the occupants elsewhere after their evacuation,“ said an official. Some tenants were already apprehensive.Poonam Kanoi, who lived in the Rabindra Sarani building where two floors collapsed on Tuesday in incessant rain, said, “I want the building to be renovated but we can't move out as we we don't have the money to rent a place.“
