LUCKNOW: Two top leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) looking after the affairs of the   (BJP) in the state gathered inputs on the image of the Yogi Adityanath government for a feedback to be given to party president Amit Shah before his visit to Lucknow.

 RSS sah sarkaryawahs (joint general secretaries)   and   camped in Lucknow from March 30 to April 2 and interacted with both deputy chief ministers, ministers, party functionaries and workers. They also had a meeting with the   (regional heads) of the RSS from UP and Uttarakhand.
 
 
 The exercise was aimed at ascertaining the government’s image, ministers’ performance and their relations with grassroots workers and public, as also the reasons behind the BJP’s defeat in the two byelections.
 
 An assessment was also done on the likely impact of the coming together of the   (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) for the 2019 general elections.
 
 BJP sources revealed that the party high command as well as the RSS top brass had been apprised of some friction in the government as some of the ministers were not delivering results, growing disconnect between workers and the government, apart from NDA allies’ disenchantment with the BJP. The RSS office-bearers were also concerned over the Opposition campaign to brand the BJP as anti-Dalit.
 
 
 The feedback would be submitted to RSS chief, Mohan Bhagwat, who would, in turn, brief Shah. The BJP chief is landing in Lucknow on April 10.
