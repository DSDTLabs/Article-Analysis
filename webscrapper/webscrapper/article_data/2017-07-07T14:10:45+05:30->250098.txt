PUNE: The   city police on Wednesday arrested two employees of a Hyderabad-based wholesale jeweller on the suspicion of stealing 4.7kg gold ornaments worth Rs 1.6 crore.

 “We arrested   (41) and Mohammad Khalifa (35) after the jeweller suspected their involvement in the  ,” Prakash Shitole, sub-inspector of Lonavla city police, said. The 36-year-old complainant Pankajkumar Gupta supplies gold ornaments to jewellers in the different states. 
 
 On Tuesday, the jeweller told his employees, Agarwal and Khalifa, to deliver about 10kg of gold ornaments to Mumbai. The ornaments were kept in two bags. 
 
 One bag contained 4.7kg of gold ornaments and the other bag contained the remaining 6kg of gold ornaments, police said.
 
 The duo left   in a private luxury bus on Tuesday night. The bus halted at a restaurant in Valvan near Lonavla, around 9am on Wednesday. “According to the claims made by the suspects, Agarwal first stepped out of the bus to drink some tea and returned soon. Till then, Khalifa was in charge of the bags,” Shitole said.
 
 Shitole said, “Both Agarwal and Khalifa claimed that two men entered the bus and took away one of the two bags. The duo claimed they got off the bus, called Gupta and informed him about the theft. Gupta told them to report the matter to the police. When both could not explain how the miscreants were able to take away the bag when it was not left unattended as per their claim, it turned the suspicion on them.”
 
 Gupta lodged a complaint against the two. “We have arrested them and our probe is on,” Shitole said. The police are checking CCTV footage in the restaurant and nearby establishments to verify the suspects’ claims.
