Thane: Police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s crack-down on the fuel scammers is set to trigger action against the cheating   in neighbouring Gujarat who are said to have purchased the equipment to manipulate the readings of fuel dispensing machines from the arrested mastermind Prakash Nulkar.

 “Nulkar, who was picked up from Hubli early this week, has allegedly confessed to the crime and revealed names and identities of his clients in Gujarat as well as Uttar Pradesh.
 
 “He has shared the information about his clients and soon, they too would be exposed. In fact, a high-ranking official from the Gujarat police called on the top police administration on Friday to secure the names of the fuel stations who have got the chips,” a senior police official told TOI.
 
 “Upon getting the information about Nulkar’s arrest, the Gujarat police officials visited us to understand the technology involved in the operation and how one could identify the fraud. They will be soon checking all the fuel stations there based on the information provided by Nulkar,” said a senior officer from Thane crime branch.
 
 Nulkar has allegedly informed the police that he used to get chips and other raw materials for tampering from China and sell them to Japan, Mauritius and South Africa. 
 
 The Thane crime branch had started the raid on June 16 after they got a tip that many petrol pumps in the Thane district have done tampering of electronic equipments in dispensing units of fuel stations.
