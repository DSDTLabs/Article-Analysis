Gurgaon: To improve connectivity between Dwarka expressway and  , Huda is planning to complete the construction of Sector 84-88 dividing road.

 While the construction work has been delayed as the Rohtas ki Dhani oustees are yet to vacate the land, according to officials, the Huda has now decided to lay a   to ensure vehicular movement from the e-way to IMT Manesar.
 
 The urban development body had planned to connect the expressway with IMT Manesar via the master roads of Sector 84,85,86,87 and 88. The construction for a majority of the master roads in these new sectors is complete. However, the construction of half-a-kilometre stretch at Rohtas ki Dhani is hanging fire as the inhabitants are yet to vacate the land.
 
 “The oustees of Rohtash ki Dhani have been allotted plots and to ensure connectivity between NPR and Manesar,” Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav said and added, “We have scheduled a meeting with inhabitants of Rohtas Ki Dhani to get the land parcel and complete the missing link between NPR and IMT Manesar.”
 
 Huda had allotted alternative plots to most of the NPR oustees in a bid to make Gurgaon portion of Dwarka Expressway motorable at earliest. “So the completion of road connecting NPR to IMT Manesar is also essential,” Yadav said.
 
 At present, NH-8 passing through Gurgaon, also known as Gurgaon-Jaipur expressway, is the only road connecting Delhi with Manesar industrial areas. However, commuters using the expressway face constant traffic snarls.
 
 Rresidents have welcomed Huda’s move. Pradeep Sharma, who has invested in a residential project in Sector 84, said the completion of the road will benefit people in all the sectors from 81-95.
