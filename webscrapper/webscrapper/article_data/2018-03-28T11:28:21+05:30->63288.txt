NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation ( ) property tax department has yet not reduced the tax of around 1 lakh properties despite orders of the general body seven months ago.

 In an another development, the department has taken a decision to issue demand notes of two years at a time to around 3 lakh properties in the upcoming fiscal.
 
 The NMC had introduced new property tax system— ready reckoner value + rent chart— from April 1, 2015. The tax of 5.50 lakh properties was supposed to be revised after a revaluation drive. The property tax department miserably failed to launch the revaluation drive in 2015-16 and 2016-17 financial years.
 
 However, the department revised tax of 1.36 lakh consumers as per the new tax system in 2015-16 with effect from April 1, 2015. The tax of around 1 lakh residential and commercial properties was increased 2 to 5 times. The department planned to recover the difference amount of two years from the remaining 4.14 lakh properties after completion of the revaluation drive.
 
 Ruling party leader Sandip Joshi and corporator Pravin Datke, also a former mayor, had tabled a proposal in the general body on July 20, 2017, seeking revision in effective date of new tax system. Accordingly, the general body had passed a resolution directing the department to implement new tax system from April 1, 2017.
 
 Joshi told TOI that the property tax department was directed very clearly to adjust revised tax in the following property tax bills. “System should be the same for all the taxpayers. The department was supposed to calculate the revised tax amount and deduct it in the bills of 2017-18. I will look into the matter and ensure all the taxpayers get relief,” he said.
 
 The NMC has already started to distribute demand notes for 2017-18 since the last couple of months. Owners of around 1 lakh properties did not get any relief.
 
 A prime example is a commercial property situated in Dharampeth and a residential property in Panchpaoli. Tax of commercial property was Rs20,061 and was revised to Rs78,243 in 2015-16 as per new tax system. The property owner did not receive any notice from the NMC informing about the revision. Even demand note of 2015-16 and 2016-17 sent to the owner was not as per the revised tax amount. Few days ago, the owner received a notice warning of auction of property. The department said there was arrears of Rs1,92,989 on the property, despite the owner paying the taxes of 2015-16 and 2016-17 on time.
 
 Similarly, tax of residential property of Panchpaoli was revised to Rs1,786 from Rs859 in 2015-16. The owner got demand note few days ago. There was no reduction in the tax amount.
 
 An official from the department said the general body’s decision was not clear on adjusting the revised tax amount. “Also, the general body changed tax system of rental properties on July 20, 2017. Tax of rental properties was reduced to a great extent. We will have to increase tax of these rental properties if the general body’s order on July 20, 2017 is considered,” he said.
 
 As per the new tax system, the department was supposed to prepare and distribute demand notes to 5.50 lakh properties by March 31. As on date, demand notes to 2.50 lakh properties have been distributed. Therefore, the department has taken a decision to include tax of 2017-18 and 2018-19 in demand notes that will be distributed after April 1. Around 3 lakh taxpayers will have to pay tax of two years that too as per the new system. At the same time, the department has proposed not to levy interest of 2% per month from taxpayers who did not receive demand notes in 2017-18.
