MUMBAI: Two-and-a-half months after a five-year-old girl’s fatal fall from the 15th floor of a residential building in Byculla, police on Friday arrested a 35-year-old neighbour for her murder. Police sources said the   from   revealed the woman’s finger nail marks on the body of the victim,  .

 Zonal DCP Pravinkumar Padwal said, “We arrested Rekha Sutar, a neighbour of the child, after getting the forensic evidence. We are interrogating her.”
 
 The incident happened on December 19, when Manvi, daughter of a woman police constable, was playing in the common gallery on the 15th floor of the 22-storey   in Byculla. Police registered a case of murder against the unknown person saying the fall did not look natural. Later, they questioned Sutar and another woman from the building, but did not arrest her due to lack of evidence. 
 
 Sources said Sutar was mentally disturbed since she had lost her six-year-old son a year ago. Her husband had separated from her. According to sources, on the day of the murder, a postman had come to deliver her divorce notice, but she refused to accept it. Later in the day, Ashok, Manvi’s father, had allegedly criticised her for not receiving the post when she was at home. This, police sources said, perhaps angered Sutar, who was depressed. 
 
 Sources said Sutar had earlier tried to burn some clothes of Manvi that were hanging in the clothes line.
 
 At that time, Manvi’s mother, Arti, a police constable attached to the Worli traffic police headquarters, had gone for work. In his statement to police, Ashok said he was inside home when the incident took place. Police had scanned the footage from the building’s CCTV cameras but could not get any clues about the killer.
