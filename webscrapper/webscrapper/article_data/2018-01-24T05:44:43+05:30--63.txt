GURGAON: The RWA of   2 has issued an advisory to residents asking them to hold back payment of Unitech’s   for some time, alleging that since all its   are in jail, the money would be used to bail them out. 

 The RWA also met government representatives and decided to open another joint account for collecting   fee..
 
 “We would like to brief all our valued residents that   is in a financial difficulty as both its managing directors are in jail for financial impropriety. Under such circumstances, any money that it will collect will obviously be diverted to bail out its MDs and pay arrears of salaries to its staff. No money that we pay them will be utilized in maintenance of our society,” the letter read.
 
 “We have accordingly approached the government for takeover of our society by MCG, and, in the interim, to have a joint account opened with Unitech, which would be opened and operated jointly by Unitech and us. We therefore request all residents to withhold payment for some time. We would also like to reassure our residents that waiver of all penal/overdue/late payment charges is an agenda item in our negotiations with Unitech,” the letter stated.
 
 “We want 75% of the amount to be used for maintenance of mandatory services, like sewers, footpaths, common areas, etc,” said  , RWA president.
 
 Unitech spokesperson couldn’t immediately comment on the issue.
