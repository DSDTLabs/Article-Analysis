Mapusa: Gusty winds and heavy rain on Monday and Tuesday inconvenienced citizens in parts of Bardez, as several trees were uprooted and a number of areas were hit by power outages. 

 The market area in Mapusa was waterlogged, causing shoppers and traders much difficulty while they negotiated their way through inundated areas. Fire and emergency services personnel had to attend to over a dozen calls of tree collapses from Monday night, said sources.
 
 At Oxel,  , a mango tree came crashing down on a house belonging to Babuso Banaulikar at around 4am on Tuesday, causing a loss of about Rs 3 lakh. No major injuries were reported. 
 
 At Camurlim, a tree fell on a house belonging to Prime Dâ€™Mello. Two trees collapsed on the compound wall at Ucassaim and at Cumbar Vaddo in Anjuna. Incidents of tree and branches collapsing on roads at Ucassaim, near the Duler football ground, near St Thomas School at Aldona, near St Francis Xavier School at Siolim, and at Pirna and Guirim obstructed the smooth movement of traffic.
 
 In Paliem, an over 100-year-old tree that housed a small religious shrine, near Bhumika Vetal temple fell due to incessant rain on Tuesday evening. Tree trunks came crashing down in the precincts of the temple damaging property and a parked car, while also blocking the road. A two-wheeler parked beneath the tree was spared damage.
 
 In Pernem, fire and emergency services personnel had to attend to 14 calls requesting that debris created by uprooted trees be cleared and traffic movement restored.
