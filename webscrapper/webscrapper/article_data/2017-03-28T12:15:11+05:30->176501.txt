NEW DELHI: The   party's Digvijaya Singh continues to add to his long list of gaffes, unless this latest one was more a case of wishful thinking.

 Digvijaya posted a video on Twitter produced by former Congress MP Rajkumari Ratna Singh. After he posted the video he explained that Ratna Singh is a daughter of the late Dinesh Singh, the latter having been in former PM  's cabinet and in the "  Cabinet."
 
 Which 'Rahul Gandhi Cabinet'? Precisely. There has never been a 'Rahul Gandhi Cabinet.' 
 
 
  
  
 
 To be fair, it might have been a slip of the tongue on Digvijaya's part and he might have meant to say '  cabinet', of which Dinesh Singh was indeed a member.
 
 Digvijaya later corrected the tweet to say it was Rajiv Gandhi's cabinet that Dinesh Singh was in. But in correcting it, he goofed up again and spelled 'Rajiv' wrong.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 It seems the senior Congress leader slips up often. Last August, while speaking to reporters, he referred to Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir as India-Occupied-Kashmir. This, at a time when tensions were at an all time high between the two neighbours, after security forces killed Kashmiri terrorist Burhan Wani on July 8.
 
 In the past, Digvijaya famously referred to terrorists Osama bin Laden as "Osamaji" and Hafiz Saeed as "saheb".
 
 As well, not all his so-called gaffes have been slips of the tongue. Some have been downright offensive.
 
 In 2013, he described party colleague Meenakshi Natarajan as "sau tunch maal" ("totally unblemished" in Hindi, literally). The phrase loosely translates to "desirable object" or "sexy".
 
 Later, Digvijaya said his remark meant that Natarajan was like "pure gold" and threatened legal action against TV channels for wrongly reporting it.
