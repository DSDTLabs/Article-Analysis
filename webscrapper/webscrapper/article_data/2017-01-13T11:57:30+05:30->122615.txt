RANCHI: Chief minister   on Thursday announced that his government will construct 30 lakh toilets across various places to make the state open defecation free (ODF) by 2018. 

 Speaking at a youth festival in Ranchi's Chandwe on the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, Das said that the government will also set up a youth commission and chalk out a youth policy 'within a month' to ensure their employment. 
 
 Stating that his government was following Vivekananda's principles of "serving the poor and needy", the CM made a veiled attack on the opposition and accused them of exploiting the tribal communities. 
 
 "The leaders have tied the poor with chains of caste and are exploiting them. We have to keep the teachings of Swami Vivekananda in mind and create a caste-free society," Das said.
 
 The CM also tried to present a pro-poor image of his government, less than a fortnight before tabling the annual budget. "This year will be the year of the poor. This year's budget will also be for the development of the poor," Das said in his address. 
 
 On January 1, members of the tribal community in   had hurled slippers at the CM's convoy to express their dissent against the state government's amendments in the land ownership clauses in the Chotanagpur Tenancy (CNT) and   (SPT) Acts. Following the incident, Seraikela-Kharsawan deputy commissioner and superintendent of police were transferred and an FIR against 500 people were lodged. 
 
 The government continues to face stiff criticism within his own party over the amendments in the CNT-SPT Acts. On Wednesday, during the second day of the state BJP committee meet, former CM and senior BJP leader Arjun Munda said, "The CM should reconsider the amendments in the two land acts. Before taking such decision, the long-term impact should have been taken into account. I also wrote a letter to the CM but no corrective step has been taken."
