  Shivpuri, who gained fame from the movie 'Aankhe'n, is currently seen as an antagonist on the show ;Iss   3' as Indrani Vashishth. Talking about her visit and love for the city of Nawabs, the actor shares, "I love coming to this city. I even did my pre-wedding shopping from here." Explaining further about what attracts her most to the city, she says, "Food and shopping attract me the most to Lucknow. You know I go berserk over   and my wardrobe is filled with heavy Lakhnawi suits. The last time I was here for work, I did a lot of shopping, toh iss baar shopping nahi hogi," says the actor.
 Rituâ€™s look in the show is typical Indian, yet modern and classy. Since the show is based on Allahabad, special ethnic touch is given to her character. "This is the first negative role in my entire acting career. Initially it was very challenging for me; I used to think ki kaise karungi because I don't understand how people can be so negative. I used to think, how can people be so evil and devious to do such acts, then I started living the character to understand it better," says the actor adding that another thing she found hard to do was get the language and the diction right for her character. "Yahan logon ki Hindi shuddh hoti hai and ek lehza hota hai baat karne ka. Getting that right was also a difficult task for me." 
 Taking a long hiatus from films and TV, Ritu reveals that her marriage and then twins kept her away from acting for so many years. "Bachche sab kara dete hain. I have twins so I had to devote time to them as well. I am a greedy actor, greedy for good acting and very passionate about this art. As I step in front of the camera, mujhe lagta tha ki mera 10 kilo khoon badh gaya hai. According to my kids I am not just a star but a super star on this planet."
