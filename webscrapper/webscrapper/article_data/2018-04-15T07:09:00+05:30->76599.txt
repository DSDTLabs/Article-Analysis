Ludhiana: City-based doctor Manas Panigrahi’s words gave a lot of hope to those who suffer from epilepsy. Panigrahi said epilepsy can be treated by a surgery in the city now.

 Panigrahi, who was present at a media interaction on Saturday in one of city hospitals in Model Town, said earlier the surgery on epilepsy patients were performed only in Hyderabad, Trivandrum, Bangalore and AIIMS Delhi. However, now Model Town-based multi-specialty hospital has started this surgery for the first time in Punjab.
 
 Dr Baldeep Singh, surgeon specialist said, “the potential benefits—seizure freedom, reversal of disability, reduced burden of antiepileptic medication, and decreased long-term morbidity and mortality — are balanced against the immediate morbidity and the extremely small mortality risks of surgery.”
 
 Dr Baldeep introduced the team who will perform the   — Dr Manas Panigrahi, Dr D P Singh,and Dr Leenu Gupta. Dr D P Singh said, “The aim of epilepsy surgery is to improve the quality of life for the patients suffering from refractory seizure disorder, who have tried a number of epilepsy medicines and are still having seizures.”
 
 According to Panigrahi, all epilepsy surgery involves the brain. “The operations generally involve removal of epileptogenic tissue from the area where seizures arise or interruption of nerve pathways along which seizure impulses spread,” he said.
 
 Dr Samarpan, strategic head of a hospital, said, “Our hospital is always willing to bring the best medical facilities for the people of this region. We are going to start the epilepsy surgery. It will help the patients suffering from refractory seizures.”
