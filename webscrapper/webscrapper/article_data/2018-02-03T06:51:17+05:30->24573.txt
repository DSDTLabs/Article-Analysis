KOLKATA: A 52-year-old person was shot dead inside a salon in the northern fringes of the city by eight bike-borne men on Friday morning.

 The victim,  , also called ‘mati mafia’, was a promoter by profession. Before they started spraying bullets, the goons hurled bombs outside the salon and downed the shutters. After firing 10 to 12 rounds, they fled from the spot.One person has been detained.
 
 
 The incident happened near Madhyamgram’s Basunagar close to   Road. Sarkar was rushed to a private hospital off Jessore Road but was declared brought dead.
 
 According to sources, this was the third time Dey Sarkar was attacked. He had been shot at twice earlier, but survived. Cops said he had a criminal past and prima facie, the shooting appears to be the fallout of a gang war.
 
 “We suspect a rivalry between two gangs over a 16-cottah land could have led to the shooting. Contract killers from Birati and Amdanga were also hired to ensure his death,” a senior district police official said.
 
 According to cops, the goons who killed Sarkar belonged to the gang of Pradip Dey, was the prime accused in a flyover shooting case. Dey died in Presidency jail in 2017.
 
 Local said after the death of Dey, his nephew   took control of the gang that had been eyeing some crucial plots off Jessore Road and Sodepur-Barasat Road. He had the backing of some senior political leaders.
 
 “A fresh rivalry broke out between Modak and Sarkar over grabbing control of a 16-cottach land off Sodepur-Barasat road near Madhyamgram Sajirhat. Goutam had somehow managed to grab the land, which led to a fight between the two,” said a local.
 
 ASP, Barasat,  , said: “After preliminary investigation, we suspect a rivalry over land could have led to the murder. We have already got names of some of the accused.”
