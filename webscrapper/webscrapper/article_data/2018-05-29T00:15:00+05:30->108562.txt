Trichy: An exclusive unit for unani medicine treatment has been opened at the district siddha block of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) government hospital here on Monday.  District collector K Rajamani inaugurated the unit which will provide treatment to patients under the unani method, widely known as Islamic medicine.  The unit will function on two days – Mondays and Saturdays – every week, from 7.30am to 12pm and 3pm to 5pm. Unani practitioner G Shamsath has been deputed to the unit. District siddha medical officer S Kamaraj said that with the inauguration of the unani unit all five modes of Ayush will be available at the district siddha block treatment.  Unani involves treatment through regimental, cupping, leech, venesection, massage, exercise, diet and pharmacological therapies. Treatment will be available for rheumatoid arthritis, varicose vein, paralysis, memory loss, neurological disorders, joint pains, ulcer, jaundice, lung-related problems, skin diseases, infertility and paralytic attack. Shamsath said though the treatment has Arabian roots, it is not restricted to a certain religion. “Unani treatment is preferred by people cutting across all religions and irrespective of age because of its effective results,” he said.  Doctors practising Indian medicine have appealed to the collector to ensure that the siddha unit functioning inside the collector office on Monday, Wednesday and Friday be provided with necessary facilities like a separate indent from Tamil Nadu medical plant farms and herbal medicine corporation limited (TAMPCOL), two BP apparatus, stethoscopes, IR lamps among other things.  The department also asked the collector to provide them a shed near the outpatient ward of the siddha block to tide over the space crunch. A 16 bed in-patient ward for siddha, ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy, homeopathy, varma therapy, combined therapy for autism patients and Ayush club are the other facilities functioning at present at the district siddha block.
