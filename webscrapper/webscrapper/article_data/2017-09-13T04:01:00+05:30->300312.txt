 Possibly keeping in mind the election year, the CM even insisted on quality and asked corporation office bearers to maintain quality of roads. The CM said efforts should be made to win back faith of the people. 
 
 The chief minister has also directed his party men and office bearers of the party ruling that respective corporations should ensure quality of work, and if quality is not maintained then office bearers including the mayor, standing committee chairman and even the municipal commissioner should take action against negligent officials.
 
 Rupani has asked respective corporations to send detailed reports of work to the commissioner, urban development department. He also asked the corporations to prepare priority lists in coordination with the corporators of respective areas.
 
 DyCM Nitin Patel, who was also in the meeting, asked office bearers to restore the roads in such a way that people should forget that the roads were damaged.
