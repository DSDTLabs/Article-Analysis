KOLKATA: Two passengers booked on an IndiGo flight to Kolkata from Bagdogra were arrested after a substance resembling explosives was found in their luggage. The duo claimed the suspicious material was medicine and that they were sales agents of a drug company based in Gurgaon. The substance has been sent to a laboratory for chemical analysis. 

 It was the IndiGo security officer at the registered baggage x-ray machine who first detected some bottles containing a powder that appeared to be an explosive. x-ray machines at the   examine the density of items under the scanner and compare them with known explosives to make a match. This appears through a colour coding on the monitor. 
 
 Alarmed, the security officer called his superior who, in turn, informed the CISF. “The bag was opened in the presence of CISF personnel and airline officials. The seven-eight bottles containing a whitish powder were put through the x-ray machine and it again matched an explosive substance. A sniffer dog was then brought in and it too indicated the presence of explosive,” said acting Bagdogra airport director  . 
 
 The two men —   and   — were then detained for questioning. The suspects claimed they were travelling from Gangtok to Kolkata and were employees of a Gurgaon drug manufacturing firm. “The suspects hail from Bihar. They are claiming the suspicious substance is medicine. Whatever it is, the chemical composition seems similar to an explosive substance. They will be in preventive custody till the chemical analysis reports arrive,” a security officer at the airport said. 
 
  tetranitrate (PETN), a derivative of pentaerythritol used as a vasodilator drug to treat certain heart conditions such as management of angina, is structurally similar to nitroglycerin, a powerful explosive. Sources said police, CID and CISF are inquiring into the matter. The flight left at 4.30pm as scheduled.
