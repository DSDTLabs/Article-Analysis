BAREILLY: Bharatiya Janata Party's Uttar Pradesh president Keshav Prasad Maurya on Sunday said his party would win 60 of the total 73 seats in the first phase of assembly elections, and over 300 seats in the whole of the state.
 
  After addressing a public meeting at Devchara under Bithri Chainpur constituency here, Maurya told the media, “The first phase of polling which took place on Saturday witnessed 64.5% voting and it was the result of good work done by PM   in the interests of the poor. Of the total 73 seats in the first phase, we will win nearly 60 seats. By winning more than 300 seats in UP, we are going to make the lotus bloom in the state. The public has taken the first step towards a corruption-free government and better law and order.”
  
  Expressing happiness over the results of MLC elections, Maurya said, “BJP has won all three seats — Bareilly-Moradabad, Gorakhpur-Faizabad and Kanpur — of the MLC elections with huge margins. After the results, the rush at offices of  , Congress and   has died out as their workers have realised that the BJP is going to form the government in the state.”
  
  Commenting on the alleged Hindu exodus from Kairana, Maurya said, “Due to fear of goons, families in Kairana were forced to flee. However, when the BJP government will come in power in UP, we will conduct an enquiry in eight days. We will punish the goons in such a way that no family in UP will again be compelled to move from here.”
