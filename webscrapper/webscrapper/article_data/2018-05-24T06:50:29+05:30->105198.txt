LUDHIANA: Accusing Indian Banks Association (IBA) of not fulfilling their demands, the government bank employees will go on a 48-hour strike from 6am on May 30 till 6am on June 1. Naresh Gaur, convenor of Ludhiana unit of   (UFBU) declared so on Wednesday. Gaur also said that ahead of the strike, the bank employees will also hold a massive demonstration outside SBI, Fountain Chowk on Thursday. 

 Giving more information about the strike, president of Punjab Bank Employees Federation, Ludhiana Unit,  , said, “The strike has become unavoidable as all our demands are still pending before IBA and deliberately being delayed to deprive us of our rights. In addition to the meagre offer of only 2% hike in our wages by IBA, the government too has been casual in its approach towards our demands, especially wage revision.”
 
 Thakur also added, “Some of our major demands include early wage revision settlement, adequate increase in salary and improvement in other service conditions. We also demand that wage revision settlement should include all officers upto scale 7. We do not want to cause any inconvenience to the public but we are left with no other alternative except for going on a strike. Tomorrow all of us will gather outside SBI, Fountain Chowk and stage a protest as well.”
