GUWAHATI: Defying a   ban, hundreds of people thronged  , 80 km from Guwahati, to enjoy the traditional `moh juj' (buffalo fight) on Friday. The crowd cheered as more than 15 pairs of buffaloes locked horns in a large ground.However, the Ahatguri Moh Juj Aru Bhogali Utsav Udjapan Samiti (AMJABUUS), which earlier decided to hold the buffalo fight after jallikattu was allowed in Tamil Nadu, stayed away from the event. The Samiti allowed owners and keepers of buffaloes to organize the event `unofficially.' “As with jallikattu, our `moh juj' is also associated with the culture of Assam,“ said   secretary  .
