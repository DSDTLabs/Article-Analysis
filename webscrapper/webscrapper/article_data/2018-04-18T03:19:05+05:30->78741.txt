MUMBAI: The state government has issued a warning to   that did not participate in the first round of post graduate admissions that closed on April 12. 

 Colleges have been asked to submit in writing by April 20 whether they want to be part of the admission process this year or stay out of it. The government took the action suspecting private institutes would not have participated in the second round either, but jumped in during the mop-up round.
 
 To ensure students are not exploited, the   along with the state government has sent notices to all institutes. "If we don't hear from them by April 20, they will not be able to take part in this year's admission process," said DMER head Dr Praveen Shingare.
 
 Of the 11 private institutes, as TOI had reported, only a few like Kashibai Navale and ACPM, Dhule, admitted students after making them sign an undertaking that if fees were hiked, candidates would have to shell out more money. Other hospitals that conduct only post graduate courses such as Bombay Hospital, Sancheti in Pune, Sangli's Sanjeevani and Swastiyog in Miraj admitted PG candidates.
 
 If the matter is not resolved, this will be historic as private colleges across Maharashtra will not admit a fresh batch this year.
 
 Private medical colleges want to charge   even from those admitted under management quota. They have informed the government that if it does not relent, they will not admit students this year. 
 
 To date, of the 400 seats, 192 seats remain vacant. This year, all five stakeholders: private colleges, the government, the DMER, the   and the Fee Regulating Authority (FRA) jointly agreed on a three-tier structure under which a college can charge NRI quota (15%) students up to five times the fees of merit students, while management (35%) quota students can be charged up to three times. But after admissions began, private colleges went back on their word.
 
 Private college heads were not available for comment.
