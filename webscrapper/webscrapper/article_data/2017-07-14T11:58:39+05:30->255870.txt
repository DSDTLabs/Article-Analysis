AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Thursday questioned the state government about whether it has powers to take away management quota seats from self-financed institutes  , ayurveda and nursing colleges.

 An association of the managements of SFIs   in these three courses moved the HC after the state government issued a circular stating that seats of the management quota would be governed by the centralized admission committee.
 
 In its defence, the state government submitted that the decision to take the power from the institution for filling the seats was taken after it was brought to the notice of the government that SFIs “indulge in corrupt practices”, which is detrimental to the  .
