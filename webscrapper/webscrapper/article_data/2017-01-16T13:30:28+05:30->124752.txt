Sangam(Allahabad): The   seems to have turned into a spiritual and meditation centre for scores of   who have sought refuge on its banks this Magh Mela. 

 Be it   (a CA final year student) of Allahabad,   (pursing MBBS first year) of Meerut or Utkarsh Tripath (an engineering aspirant) of Kanpur, the youths are busy interacting with kalpwasis and heads of various religious organizations to find answers to their queries regarding rituals, importance of spiritualism and Hindu religion.
 
 Aporva says, "There has to be a logic behind everything. I just want to know why rituals have been followed for ages."
 
 Utkarsh too has had his interactions with kalpwasis and says, "There is something about this place that gives people inner peace, enabling them to stay on river banks in chilly winter conditions."
 
 Chikky Singh says, "When you hear shlokas, bhajans and even participate in religious and spiritual activities on the banks of Ganga, it enlightens you. Everyone should come to Sangam to rejuvenate spiritually." 
 
 "Youngsters have been approaching us to know about religion, spiritualism and even meditation," said a prominent seer, adding, "It's a good sign that youngsters are interested in spiritualism."
 
 "Youngsters want to debate over spiritualism and kalpwas logically and scientifically and when their queries are answered, they not only appreciate it but also want to follow the rituals as well," said the saint.
