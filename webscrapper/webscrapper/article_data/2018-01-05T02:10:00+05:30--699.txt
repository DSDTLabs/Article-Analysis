Nagpur: In spite of the traffic police trying several measures to bring some order to the city’s traffic, data for the last two years shows the blatant disregard of traffic rules by people. In 2017, traffic police fined 1,812 drivers every day in Nagpur. This roughly translates to penalizing 151 errant motorists every hour, considering the cops work from 9am to 9pm.

 Data released by the traffic police shows a rise in traffic violations. The city traffic police recorded a 22% increase in overall traffic violations last year, with motorists paying Rs16.77 crore as fine for over 6.61 lakh traffic violations in 2017 under various provisions, including the Motor Vehicles Act. This was far higher than the cases filed the previous year — 5.51 lakh in 2016.
 
 Parking violations, helmetless driving, parking on the footpath, and lane indiscipline remained the most reported violations.
 
 There is a decline in speeding cases — from 1,724 in 2016 to 1,317 in 2017 — and an increase in driving without licence, which went up from 2,678 in 2016 to 5,521 in 2017. There was also a steep decline in helmetless driving cases, with 2.01 lakh motorists being fined in 2016 as against only 55,921 drivers in 2017.
 
 Even driving without seat belt too witnessed a sharp decline. Against 50,235 cases in 2016, the cops caught only 12,342 violators.
 
 DCP (traffic) Ravindrasinh Pardeshi said that the number of cases were more since lakhs of offenders were penalized through e-challans. Of the 6,61,377 violators, 3,80,509 offenders were penalized through e-challans.
 
 Pardeshi claimed that cases of helmetless driving and not using seat belts came down since police continued their special drive against these two violations from 2016, and as a result 90% two-wheeler riders have started wearing headgear, while almost every four-wheeler driver uses seat belt when they drive.
 
 There are about 20 lakh vehicles plying in the city. Of these, 14 lakh are two-wheelers. “Bikers form a big chunk of traffic rule offenders, and we need to focus more on such offenders,” the officer said.
 
 Traffic experts, on the other hand, believe that offences like rash driving, speeding, lane cutting and signal jumping are interconnected. “During non-peak hours, drivers tend to speed. While speeding, they tend to drive rashly, jump signals and cut lanes, which leads to several mishaps in the city,” said a traffic expert.
 
 Experts also stressed the need for the traffic department to start penalizing repeat offenders. Currently, the department has no system to track repeat traffic violators. According to traffic expert Vinay Kunte, “I do not see any change in motorists’ arrogant behaviour on roads in Nagpur.” Majority of the drivers have become arrogant and do not mind paying heavy fines after being caught by traffic police.
 
 “I have a feeling that the traffic police are more active in West Nagpur in collecting fines since there is a majority of middle and affluent class in this area. Police can easily complete their quota of traffic violation fines in West Nagpur. I again assert that traffic police should direct all their efforts in breaking the arrogance of drivers in Nagpur, instead of just collecting fines. Retraining the citizens will solve the traffic problems to a great extent,” he said.
