Thanks to our lifestyle and late-night work schedules,   are extremely common. The good news is that they are really easy to get rid of. Here’s what you need...

 1. 
  Drinking at least 10 glasses of water every day helps eliminate wasteful toxins from your body. This helps in reducing the incidence of dark circles. Also limit your intake of caffeine which dehydrates your body.
 
 2. 
  Keep a metal spoon in the freezer, overnight. Apply it under your eyes upon waking up followed by a face cream.
 
 3. 
 
  Applying cold used tea bags or herbal tea leaves on your eyelids soothes them, and gets rid of dark circles. 
 
 4. 
  Put cucumber or potato slices over your eyelids for 10 minutes and then wash your eyes with cold water. This boosts blood circulation.
 
 5. 
  Make a paste with 1 tsp tomato juice, 3 drops of lemon juice, a pinch of turmeric and flour. Use it on the under-eye area and wash after 15 mins.
 
 6. 
  Try and average at least 8 hours of sleep to get rid of dark circles.
 
 7. 
  Especially around noon to about 4pm. If you can’t, at least apply sunscreen and wear sunglasses, too.
