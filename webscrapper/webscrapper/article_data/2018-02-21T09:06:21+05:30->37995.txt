CHARMINAR: The Jamaat-e-Islami Hind Telangana & Odisha said the passage of 12 % Muslim reservation   was unlikely or it may be hung in limbo. Jamaa-e -Islami Hind Telangana & Odisha state president Hamid Mohammed Khan said, the Muslim reservation issue has become a bone of contention for the state government and the passage of such bill in Parliament seems unlikely. 

 "Unless the problem is addressed or solved, the government can't move ahead. In my view at the eleventh hour, an ordinance may be issued. Later it may be challenged or get stayed as the 4 percent reservation now has been stayed,'' said  . Earlier, the Telangana legislature passed the bill, enhancing reservations for Muslims and scheduled tribes to 12% and 10% respectively, for admission in educational institutions and for state services. Beside this, Jamaat e   lauded the recent visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Palestine.
 
 "PM Modi's recent visit to Palestine is a welcome move and this will give out positive messages among people of Palestine that India is behind their cause and supports them in their legitimate struggle against the illegal occupation by the Israelis," said a JIH member.
