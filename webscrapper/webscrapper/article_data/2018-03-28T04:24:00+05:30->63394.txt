Vadodara: The representative committee of five advocates which was appointed by the Baroda Bar Association for resolving the issue of seating arrangement had a meeting with the principal district judge on Tuesday to see the space for temporary arrangement until the permanent arrangement is made. During the meeting of a delegation of senior advocates from Vadodara with the chief justice and other judges of Gujarat high court last week, the chief justice had told them that once the representative committee will be constituted by the bar association, the district judge will be informed to allocate spare rooms in the main building for temporary seating arrangement. “Two halls on the ground floor of main building measuring around 1,700 square feet were showed to us and that will be for temporary seating. We will soon draft our representation regarding the seating arrangement and forward it to the committee of five judges of high court and once they have gone through it, they will call us,” said senior advocate Shailesh Patel, who is part of the representative committee. Once the permanent solution is reached and the new building for lawyers is made, the halls in the main building will be vacated by the advocates.
