KOLKATA: After the  , citizens will now have a weekend cultural fiesta at  . From April 15, the heritage waterbody adjacent to Writers’ Buildings will be an attractive venue to spend weekends. Kolkata   officials are giving the finishing touch to project.

 According to plans, the KMC along with state tourism and culture and information departments will throw open a space beside the waterbody (opposite GPO) for the carnival. Here, tourists or locals will enjoy theatre, soiree or other cultural functions. A makeshift stage will be erected in the arena to accommodate artists or theatre groups for their weekend performances.
 
 The KMC has given a facelift to the waterbody to attract tourists. Like Monohardas Tarag, a waterbody in   area, the civic body has installed six colour fountains which will be operational from evening. The trees around Laldighi will be decorated with lights as an added attraction.
 
 Mayor   on Monday said the weekend carnivals at Laldighi will be one of the most crowd-pulling events of the city. 
 
 “We will make sure people who will go to the spot to enjoy the weekend won’t be disappointed. Keeping in mind BBD Bagh’s status as a world heritage zone, we have arranged everything which won’t dampen the heritage sprit of the area,” Chatterjee said.
