THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state has made rapid strides in healthcare and the sector should now be elevated to meet international standards,   Pinarayi   said here on Wednesday.

 
 Speaking after laying the foundation stone for the State   on 25 acres at the Life Science Park at Thonnakkal near here, the chief minister said the establishment would have international research status.
 
 The virology institute gained importance after the brain-damaging Nipah virus claimed 13 lives in Kozhikode and Malappuram.
 
 The state has been facing difficulties in detecting the spread of certain diseases due to the lack of facilities, Vijayan said.
 
 “Hence, there is a need for such research institutes for detecting the behaviour of viruses. Now we are depended on several institutes outside the state. The state needs more international research institutes to overcome the difficulties,” the chief minister said.
 
 Currently, samples taken from Nipah-suspected patients are being tested in labs in Manipal and Pune.
 
 Vijayan said the state should have a healthy society since it has been aiming at overall development. Virology institute could spur the health sector, especially in implementing preventive mechanisms.
 
 “The state is witnessing several kinds of epidemics unknown to us. We will have to tackle them with the help of this institute which will be completed in a record time. The government wants it to be commissioned by this year-end, the chief minister said.
 
 Minister for industries A C   said more land would be made available if the institute needed more space.
