PUNE: The state will soon issue a government resolution (GR) for the land acquisition and compensation models for the proposed Purandar airport.

 District collector   shared this information with TOI after meeting chief minister   on Friday. “We need at least Rs 2,300 crore for the project and the state government has assured me that there would be no shortage of funds,”   said, adding that a GR on the land acquisition and compensation models for the project-hit villagers is expected soon.
 
 Nearly 3,000 hectares of land needs to be acquired from seven villages for the proposed airport. Of this, 2,367 hectare will be utilized for the project.
 
 “Once the GR is issued, the district administration can start talks with the project-affected people as there will be clarity on the models of compensation. The administration has offered nearly four models of compensation, besides the direct purchase plan. The compensation and rehabilitation model has been worked on the lines of the Amravati model,” the collector said.
 
 The main airport will come up on 1,100 hectares of land and the remaining land will be used for ancillary purposes, such as convention centres, commercial establishments, cargo hub, among others. “For all this, the GR needs to be issued by the state,” Rao said, adding that everything will be done after dialogue with the locals.
 
 The district administration has directed five deputy collectors to speed up the land acquisition and compensation talks. “Each of the deputy collectors will be responsible for the acquisition of 600 hectares for the project,” Rao added.
 
 Ahead of the acquisition, the revenue administration has updated the records of these villages.
