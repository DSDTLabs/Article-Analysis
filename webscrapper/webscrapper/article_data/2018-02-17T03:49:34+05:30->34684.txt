GURUGRAM: Nearly 100   took out a rally from Kamla Nehru Park near Sadar Bazar till PWD minister Rao Narbir Singh’s residence on Friday morning to protest against mandatory   of workers. According to the protesters, many workers do not have means or knowledge for online registration and the state government should give them an option of offline registration, as well.

 “All workers’ benefits are linked to their registration cards. However, of late, workers are having trouble getting themselves registered or renewing their registrations as the process is online,” said Rajinder Singh, district secretary,   ( ), Gurgaon.
 
 The workers also demanded for an enrolment system for availing medical treatment and admission to hospitals through their passbooks. “Workers live in poor conditions and have no access to clean drinking water. So very often, they fall ill. It is important that they have access to healthcare, when required,” said Vinod Paswan, president, CITU. He added that the money with state construction workers’ welfare board should be used for the treatment of workers. 
 
 Over the past two months, workers and labourers in the city have led a number of protests, which stand in complete contrast to the state government’s pro-worker claims.
