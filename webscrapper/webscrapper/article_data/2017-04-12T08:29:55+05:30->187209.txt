PANAJI: The government is devising a plan to demolish the 35-year-old college block of the   ( ) at Bambolim. The structure houses five departments, in addition to three lecture halls, and is quickly falling apart. Students and staff have voiced safety concerns but with every block that crumbles, authorities downplay the accident. 

 At the start of the academic year 2016, a parapet outside one of the lecture halls had collapsed. Jude  , a Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) official in charge of GMC maintenance, said the two lecture halls had been closed after the incident. However, a source said they were re-opened in February and lectures are being conducted there. On any working day, the building is used by around 600 people. 
 
 A staff member, on the condition of anonymity, told TOI that several repairs have been made to the building indicating it is not strong. The patches of repairs, whether on the roof, walls, doors and windows exhibit the weakened structure. 
 
 “We have government approval to demolish the lecture halls,” Carvalho said, adding that they are awaiting a response from the dean’s office. GMC dean Dr   said they have some changes to the plan submitted by GSIDC for the proposed lecture halls and will meet officials to discuss this.   clarified that the functioning of the medical college would not be affected in any way when the old lecture halls are demolished. 
 
 Carvalho said the new lecture halls have been proposed at the dean’s office location. He added that GSIDC had suggested all sections currently located in the building, which has the dean’s office, be temporarily shifted to the old forensic building. “But we haven’t heard from dean’s office yet,” Carvalho said. Naik said he was not aware of any such proposal.
