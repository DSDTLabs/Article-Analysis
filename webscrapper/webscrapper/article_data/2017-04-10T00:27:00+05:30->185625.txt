Bhopal: Six police station in-charges were removed at 1.30 am a couple of hours before polling in Ater. Apart from 15 companies of central forces, more than 200 police personnel and home guards, two more companies of central armed forces were sent on Sunday morning for ensuring peace in Ater constituency, which has 2.11 lakh voters, said chief electoral officer of Madhya Pradesh Saleena Singh on Sunday. 

 “Going by average, it comes to deployment of around 1 personnel of central armed force for every 125 voters of Ater constituency, ” sources said. 
 
 “Two incidents of firing were reported during bypolls in Ater. One was at Sankri polling booth, where security personnel had to fire in air to control the situation. The other was not reported from any polling booth, but at a distance of around 1 km from the polling booth. The Congress candidate stayed at the polling booth for some time, triggering escalation in unrest,” Singh said. 
 
 Talking about complaints received during the polling, she said, “A complaint was received at polling booth number 128 at Pali village. A voter complained of getting wrong slip in VVPAT, but the complaint was found wrong. Again, the complaint of booth capturing of booths number 258 and 259 in Gyanpur village under Ater constituency was found incorrect.”
 
 “There was information of disturbance at three polling booths at Moonpura village and two at Singhpura village, but security forces took control of the situation and polling went on peacefully thereafter. One person was trying to muscle his way into the polling booth, sparking disturbance,” she said. 
 
 Ruling out allegations of booth capturing at Sankri polling booth, Singh said, “There is no question of booth capturing. Yes, there were disturbances, but things were brought under control.” 
 
 “Barring isolated incidents of minor violence, by-polls were conducted peacefully,” she said. 
 
 No incident of violence was reported from Bandhavgarh constituency in Umaria district. 
 
 Six police station in-charges, who were removed are Ater police station in-charge Narendra Verma, Barohi police station in-charge Manish Singh, Foof police station in-charge Vijay Singh Tomar, Surpura police station in-charge Narendra Singh Kushwaha, Pawai police station in-charge Akhil Kumar and Umri police station in-charge Surendra Singh Sikarwar.
 
 “The SHOs were removed by the EC on the complaint of Congress leaders late in the night. The orders were given by EC around 1 am,” she said.
