TRICHY: As the protest against the proposed   at Neduvasal in   entered the 15th day on Thursday, district collector S Ganesh and top police officials held talks with the protesting committee members and urged them to call off the stir.

 Some confusion prevailed at Neduvasal as members of the protesting committee announced that the protest would go on until the Union government made an official announcement that the project would be revoked. This happened before the team which met chief minister   in Chennai on Wednesday returned to Neduvasal.
 
 Hundreds of villagers from Neduvasal and surrounding areas gathered at the protesting spot as usual on Thursday. CPI state secretary   lambasted the Union government for its announcement to execute the   without getting due permission from the Tamil Nadu government.
 
 He told reporters in Pudukkottai that the state government had not given its nod to execute the project at Neduvasal, Vaanakkankadu, Kottaikadu and Nallandarkoil. The concerned authorities had not even held talks with the farmers who were to forego their fertile land, he added.
