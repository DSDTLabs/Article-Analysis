 Deceased  , who got married on May 13, had gone missing from her in-law’s house at   in Sama since May 27. A woman, who lives beside the house from where Patel’s body was found, sighted the body when she was taking morning walk on the terrace of her house on Wednesday morning. The woman called police control room. 
 
 Police said that Patel did not have injury marks on her body except a mark of blood clot on her right cheek. A dupatta was also tied to her right leg, the police said.
