Kanyakumari: BJP cadres on Saturday waved black flags at Desiya Thenmaanila Nadhigal Inaippu Vivasaayigal Sangam president P Ayyakannu at Aralvaimozhi. Around 50 BJP cadres blocked the way when the farmer activist, who is on a 100 day journey from Kanyakumari to Chennai urging both the governments to fulfil various demands, reached Aralvaimozhi.

 The key demand, for which Ayyakannu has started the journey, is to urge the Centre to form the Cauvery Management Board immediately. BJP cadres who blocked the way and waved black flags at him raised slogans alleging that the activist was spreading false information against PM Modi and the Centre. The demonstration affected traffic and created a flutter for some time on the busy Nagercoil - Tirunelveli Road. TNN
