MUMBAI: The   (MbPT) plans to decongest the roads of Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai by ferrying cargo meant for the city that arrives at   ( ) in Nhava Sheva by barges.

 “This will be a huge benefit for Mumbai as the cargo can be transported by sea instead of the road network. Besides saving money on fuel, there will be other benefits like reduced transportation cost and curbing pollution,” said MbPT chairman Sanjay Bhatia.
 
 As of now, around 600 container trailers move to Bhiwandi from JNPT via Thane and back daily. Also, 900 trucks enter Mumbai city from Bhiwandi with that cargo via Thane and back d aily. On an average, the truckers cover a distance of 140 km to ferry the goods from JNPT to Bhiwandi via Thane and back.
 
 Phase I of the project will be completed by May 2018, and Phase II in 2019. “We feel the move will help take around 400 trucks and trailers off the roads daily between JNPT and Bhiwandi. Also, around 600 trucks that enter Mumbai from Bhiwandi daily will also be taken off,” said Bhatia.
 
 
  
 The Mumbai-bound cargo that comes to JNPT will be cleared at customs there. A shallow berth and special yard will be provided, from where containers will move to the barge berths at Mumbai port. MbPT and JNPT share a common channel through which the cargo will be transported. At the Mumbai port, the containers will be opened and the cargo dispersed in smaller vehicles.
 
 MbPT said it is in consultations with the customs department to provide a green channel for the containers. It will also provide warehouses for JNPT containers from among its own warehouses as well as through public-private partnerships.
 
 The port trust has begun several other projects, including ferry services between Bhaucha Dhakka and Mandwa, and Nerul under the Sagarmala scheme. The Rs 250-crore project, of which MbPT’s share is Rs 32 crore, is expected to be opened by March 2018. The services are expected to carry 2.5-3 lakh passengers per year.
