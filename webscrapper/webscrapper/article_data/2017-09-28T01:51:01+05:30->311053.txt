Thane:   illegally-run lounge   and hookah   at Naupada and Upvan were razed by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) authorities on Wednesday.

 The three drinking joints— Shilpa bar opposite Aradhana Talkies, Antic Palace at Teen petrol pump, Pushpa Vihar near Vandana Talkies and Sur Sangeet bar at Upvan were demolished. 
 
 The tin shade of the terrace, which was an   extension at Antic Palace and its furniture were completely demolished by the team, which was backed by the police sleuths. 
 
 The civic action is in the wake of a meeting between municipal commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal and his zonal officers last week wherein it was decided to bring down all illegal joints. 
 
 Apart from this, several lounges and pubs at Kothari compound were issued notice by the civic administration. Jaiswal announced that stern action will be taken against those commercial establishments, including lounges and   parlours found flouting the norms mentioned under Section 376 (A) of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act. 
 
 The units that have shifted their base from the initial operations without the approval of authorities are also being targeted.
