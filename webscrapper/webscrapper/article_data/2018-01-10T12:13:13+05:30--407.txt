VIJAYAWADA: Around 13 parliamentarians from the state participated in the annual meeting with   (SCR) general manager   on Tuesday and demanded of him to accord 'railway zone' for Visakhapatnam. They pointed out to the railway board that the zone was promised in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act-2014 and bemoaned that it was yet to kick off in the newly carved state. 

 Most of the parliamentarians felt that the meeting should have been conducted in November and felt that it was pointless to do so now as most of the preparations for the General Budget-2018-19 were already done. Even GM Yadav did admit that most of the preparations had been completed but assured the legislators that some important changes keeping AP in mind would be made by Tuesday evening. Senior parliamentarians JC   and   were miffed that their proposals for various development projects would be included only in supplements. Controversial MP Diwakar Reddy said, "State MPs have been weeded out like curry leaves during Parliament sessions. Ultimately, they act according to the directions given by the prime minister  .''
 
 Speaking about the delay in according railway zone to Visakhapatnam, Reddy said only the prime minister could address the issue. "He (Modi) is giving appointments occasionally to chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu to discuss the promises assured under Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act," Reddy added.
