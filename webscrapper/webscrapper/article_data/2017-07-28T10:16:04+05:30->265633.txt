LUCKNOW: The final approval before Lucknow Metro’s commercial launch has arrived, with the commissioner of   railway safety (CMRS) beginning his   of the Metro corridor on Thursday. The inspection will continue till July 31, during which the CMRS will check every component, detail of train, station, corridor and depot, before releasing his final verdict on the project. 

 Without his certification, Metro cannot ferry passengers, although the civil work is complete. On the first day, the CMRS checked the North-South corridor control room, from where trains will be monitored, the   depot, coaches of trains that have already been physically tested, and a few aspects of the Transportnagar Metro station. 
 
 The three day-long inspection will cover all aspects of passengers’ safety and comfort. Thus, the CMRC checked fire-fighting and passengers’ safety features as well on Thursday. Sources privy to the CMRS said, “The final verdict will come on Monday, when the CMRS finishes checking all parts of Metro’s priority section. He will inspect all parts in isolation and then give a report based on integrated functioning of these components.”
 
 The biggest test is of trains while they are moving. The CMRS will board a train and experience speed, driving skills, safety features, etc. Officials said if he feels further testing needs to be done, or wants more improvements, he may give another date for a second round of inspection. 
 
 The Metro project, which began in 2014 during the SP regime, is looking forward to the commercial launch of its 8.5km-long priority section between Transportnagar and Charbagh next month. While most of the civil work on this stretch is complete,   Rail Corporation (LMRC) needs CMRS’ approval for the final go-ahead, after which, it would just need chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi’s consent. 
 
 TOI had earlier reported about Metro inspection by the CMRS sometime in July-end, followed by the commercial launch in August.
