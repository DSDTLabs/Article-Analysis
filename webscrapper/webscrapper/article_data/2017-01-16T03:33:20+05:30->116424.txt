Comedian   is heart-broken. Admittedly his role in Mega Star  's next was chopped off on the edit table. Buzz is that the filmmakers decided to cut Prudhvi's role as they decided to increase screen time for ace comedian  's role. And Prudhvi took to social media to share his grief. 'Megastar gari 150th movie lo natinchadam Na adhrushtam. Scenes theesiveyadam na duradhrushtam.   rojuna Ma mother chanipoyinantha badhaga vundi' (It was my fortune to act alongside the Megastar. But my scenes getting removed is my misfortune. I feel as sad as I did when my mother passed away on Sankranthi). Tch Tch! Sorry for your loss, Prudhvi but what's with all that melodrama?!
