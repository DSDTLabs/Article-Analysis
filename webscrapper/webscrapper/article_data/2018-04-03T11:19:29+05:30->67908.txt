CHANDIGARH: The Dalits staged peaceful protests amid tight security during Bharat Bandh here on Monday. Commuters had tough time crossing the   traffic junction, while the train and bus passengers were harassed because of late service.

 The Dalits were out on the streets because on March 20, the Supreme Court had diluted certain provisions of the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act to protect honest public servants from being blackmailed with false cases of caste slur. The protestors amassed near the Hallomajra traffic lights and   village but police were swift in evicting them.
 
 Dalit protests hit parts of Punjab and Haryana. The Punjab government had to shut down all services, including transportation, internet, schools, and colleges. A Dalit protester said: “The dilution of the Act will lead to increased discrimination and crime against the backward community.”
 
 At the railway station, passenger   said: “I have been waiting for my train since 11am, and now it’s 3pm.” Bus service was also suspended for a few hours for the safety of passengers and the coaches. Hisar resident Sunita Deswal said: “I am waiting for the bus service to resume and this harassment of the general public to get over. The government should not give in to the protesters’ blackmailing tactics.” “The   remained docked inside the workshops at respective depots until normal service resumed in the evening,” a   official said.
