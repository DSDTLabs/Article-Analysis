TRICHY: The revenue officials on Tuesday sealed a private   warehouse containing tonnes of sugar allegedly for not disbursing Rs 33 crore dues to sugarcane farmers over the last four years. However, the action taken did not go down well with farmers, with many terming the move an eyewash that came only late. They said the closed-down warehouse has only 1,500 tonnes of sugar which would not make up for the arrears.

 On Tuesday, Papanasam regional deputy  , revenue inspector   arrived at the   and held talks with the authorities of sugar mills. The discussion was held at the instruction of  , state commissioner of director of sugar, following growing demand from the farmers for the same.
 
 Village administrative officers from Thirumandangudi, Umayalpuram, Thiyagasamudram and   also took part in the talk, but the revenue officials did not receive any proper reply from the sugar mills authorities. The official then closed down the warehouse to compensate for the Rs 33 crore arrears due to the cane farmers.
 
 “As the attached stock of sugar would no way compensate for the arrear amount of Rs 33 crore, the state should take over the the sugar mill till the entire arrears would be settled to the farmers. Otherwise, the action taken by the revenue officials will be just eyewash,” Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai R Vimalnathan said.
 
 "Anticipating the action, the sugar mill authorities had already shifted the entire stocks from the godown to some other location. So, the officials should bring back the entire stock and disburse the arrears to the farmers after auctioning them," he said.
 
 There are other units such as cogent plant, Press Mud unit, distillery unit where the sugar mills generating revenue should also be brought under the control of revenue authorities. And that should be utilised to repay the arrears, he said
