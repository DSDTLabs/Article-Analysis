MEERUT: The   (MMC) has removed 125   that were put up illegally in the middle of footpaths, roundabouts and dividers after several fell during the recent dust storms in the city, injuring passersby and   and property.
 
  The action was taken after annoyed residents complained about the dangers posed by the unipoles.
  
  However, the   claimed that they had removed the unipoles on its own initiative. “This was a part of our plan for the past few months. We had to do it. It was not in reaction to anything. The fact is that these unipoles were illegally erected. And if there is any illegal construction of any kind on agar nigam (MMC) land, then we are duty-bound to remove it. We were aware of the illegal unipoles in various parts of the city and we also knew of the dangers that they pose. That is why we took swift action,” said Dinesh Yadav, property officer, MMC.
  
  “These unipoles are a major nuisance, It is not as if the nagar nigam (MMC) did not know about them before. Several incidents of the poles falling on people, cars or shops have been reported in the past. People repeatedly informed the nagar nigam about such incidents. But the civic authorities did not pay much heed to such incidents seriously, This time, the nagar nigam has finally done something good. But, I hope that they are also strict and do not allow installation of any new unipoles,” said  , a resident.
  
  The MMC said that a team of more than 50 personnel worked over time for the past week in identifying and removing the unipoles across the city. “Since, these unipoles were installed across the city, we needed a lot of people to work on this since the poles had to be removed quickly. More than 50 people were involved in this task for the last one week. We have removed 125 unipoles from various parts of the city. We will also ensure that these are not allowed to be put up again in the future,” said Yadav.
