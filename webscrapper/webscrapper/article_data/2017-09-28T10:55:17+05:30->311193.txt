GANDHINAGAR: To strengthen its prospects in the 2017 assembly elections, the BJP is planning at least 15 to 18 events in Gujarat, including roadshows, rallies, and social media town halls, where   will address the masses before elections. The public meetings and rallies, which are expected to take place around Diwali, aim to bank on the PM’s political presence to counter anti-incumbency trends in the state.

  From tackling reactions on demonetization to GST, and from patidar quota stir, flogging of dalits in Una, and potholes on roads to social media campaigns like ‘Vikas gando thayo chhe, the BJP is facing many challenges and trying to balance bruised sentiments to sail through with its target of 150-plus seats.
 
 A key leader in the BJP said, “Without PM Modi it’s difficult to attract people to the public rallies, as well as build positive conditions for the party on the voting day.”
 
 He added, “The party has prepared a tentative plan of 15 to 18 major roadshows of the PM across the state mostly after Diwali (on October 19). The venues will be finalized after detailed discussions with the PM and BJP president  .’’
 
 The state BJP will be coordinating with the prime minister’s office to fix the dates of the roadshows and rallies, including possible social media town halls by the Prime Minister.
 
 Jitu Vaghani, state unit president of BJP, when asked, said, “The PM is in touch of realities in Gujarat and visits the state regularly. We have asked for several public rallies and meetings with the PM as our star campaigner. Detailed planning will take few more days.’’
 
 Like in the 2012 assembly elections, when Modi, as then chief minister of Gujarat had used 3D technology to address the public simultaneously at more than 50 places, this time, the PM is expected to hold social media town halls and address several meetings using digital media.
