PORVORIM: If you are caught not wearing a helmet while riding your  , paying a nominal fine alone will no longer make things right.   will also have to make trips to the   concerned for two consecutive evenings to attend remedial classes on road safety. 

 “I have instructed the police to not only   who don’t  , but to also summon them to the respective police station for two consecutive evenings to attend three-hour-long remedial classes to learn traffic rules,” chief minister Manohar Parrikar said during the assembly session on Tuesday, while attributing the main cause of fatalities in self-accidents to helmet-less riders. 
 
 The chief minister was replying to a calling attention motion by Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane, who, referring to a report published in TOI on May 4, 2017, said the rise in fatalities due to road accidents had created a fear and anxiety in the minds of citizens, even as he demanded that proper driving tests be conducted before issuing licences. 
 
 Parrikar told Rane that the state government has prepared an action plan to control road accidents, which it would implement soon. 
 
 He also said that of the 326 road accident fatalities recorded last year, 96 people lost their lives due to self-accidents. “The main reason behind these deaths was the absence of helmets,” Parrikar said, assuring strict action against all traffic violators. 
 
 “If we are able to reduce the accident rate by 40%, we will have achieved something,” the chief minister said, while stating the government is working towards reducing road accident fatalities to 200 in the next three to four years.
