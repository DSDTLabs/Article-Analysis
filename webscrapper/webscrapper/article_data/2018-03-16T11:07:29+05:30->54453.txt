CALANGUTE: In a case of mistaken identity, a guesthouse employee at Calangute was stabbed late Wednesday night, and is currently battling for his life at the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC).

 Calangute PI Jivba Dalvi said Amey  , 22, a resident of Canca, Mapusa, was searching for a person with whom he was on inimical terms as he had received information that he was staying at a guesthouse in Umtavaddo, Calangute, at around 11pm on Wednesday.
 
 While he was checking the rooms, the electricity failed, plunging the guesthouse into darkness. He then opened a door and found himself being confronted by an employee of the guesthouse, Vishwajeet Raut, 23, a native of Mumbai. Thinking he was being attacked in the darkness, Dhargalkar took out a knife he was carrying and stabbed Raut just below the chest. Hearing the commotion, other guests and employees rushed to the spot, and later informed the police who rushed to the site and arrested Dhargalkar.
