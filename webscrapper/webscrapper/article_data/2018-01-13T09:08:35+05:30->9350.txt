AJMER: Congress on Friday alleged that during bypolls, Vasundhara   government is not only misusing power but also violating the code of conduct. Congress wrote to the election commission of India to intervene and also sent proofs and a list of violations. A delegation of Congress also gave memorandum to district election officer and demanded to remove all posters of state government influencing voters in the constituency. Congress warned that if the violation is not stopped immediately they will prepare video of such violation for judicial remedy. 

 Congress spokesman Pratap Singh   accused ministers of Raje government of misusing power and maintaining protocol in Ajmer. "They brought MGNREGA workers in the rally of   candidate to show strength and minister   pressurised RTO department for making buses available to bring workers from villages," Khachariyawas alleged.
 
 He added that state government is bound to obey and respect the Constitution of India but they want to win the bypolls at any cost and, therefore, they are not worried about violation. "They are now constructing roads in villages as well as have started construction in different state assembly elections to lure voters," added Khachariyawas.
 
  He said, they had made a complaint against BJP president Parnami for making announcements during bypolls.
