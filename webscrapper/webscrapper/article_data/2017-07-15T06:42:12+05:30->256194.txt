CHENNAI: Every time Kalaiselvi was hooked to a   her life support for the last four years the apparatus would  , leaving technicians baffled. 

 The first time it happened six months ago, the hospital blamed a faulty device. When it happened each time the 42-year-old came, the attenders finally turned their attention to her. Kalaiselvi’s eye by then had been forced shut by a swollen cheek.
 
 The dialysis machine a filter that collects and   and returns it to the body had not turned off because of a technical glitch, but a clot in a vein on Kalaiselvi’s neck. The obstruction also caused swelling on the left half of her face and upper limb, triggering headaches. It took several visits to multiple hospitals before Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital doctors detected it. By then,   sessions were erratic.
 
 Kalaiselvi was not unfamiliar with hospital visits. Crippled in her right arm and leg by acute poliomyelitis at four, she was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease five years ago, requiring dialysis twice a week. “It is a miracle she stayed alive for four months,” said Dr  , head of the department of vascular surgery, SMCH. 
 
 A   and vascular surgeons decided to insert a balloon-tipped catheter, a thin tube, through her right groin to remove the clot. “But the catheter couldn’t reach the site of the clot as the vein had narrowed. So we did something we usually don’t do we inserted it through the left arm,” said Dr Thulasikumar. 
 
 A week later, Kalaiselvi, who was operated under the chief minister’s comprehensive health insurance scheme, was presented before the media on Friday. She had already undergone two dialysis. And this time the machines worked without a glitch.
