Ludhiana: Members of Induction Furnace Association of North India (IFNI), on Tuesday, expressed concern over delay in announcement of Time of Day (TOD) tariff by Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) and requested Punjab government to sure TOD is implemented from October 1.

 Association president K K Garg and general secretary Dev Gupta said steel manufacturers in Punjab, particularly the furnace industry, has been facing a crises for the past decade with 30% of plants having closed down. Those who are in operation have cut down their production by almost eight hours. Hundreds of furnace units are on sale in Punjab and there are no buyers. They attributed the grim situation to availability of cheaper power in neighbouring states as compared to Punjab. 
 
 They said finished goods like TMT bar, wire rod, angle, channel and industrial rounds are being easily procured from these states at much cheaper prices. Since electricity is one of the major inputs of induction furnaces, the furnace industry in Punjab will not be able to compete with other states till power tariff is slashed, they said. 
 
 Every year, we get TOD rebate from October 1 to May 31, which helps minimise losses. But with just 10 days to go for October 1, PSPCL has not even issued a circular. TOD cannot be implemented without issuance of a circular or notification. 
 
 Moreover, he said, Punjab government has announced a special tariff of Rs 5 per unit for the Punjab industry, but nothing has done on the ground level. According to him, the delay has led to considerable panic in the market and if there is no intimation from PSPCL, steel prices will escalate. IFNI also urged the state government and Punjab state electricity regulatory commission to clear the air on TOD and instruct PSPCL to issue a circular in this regard.
