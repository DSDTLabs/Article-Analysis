BATHINDA: Pakistan-based human rights activist and lawyer Asma Jahangir was cremated in Lahore, Pakistan, on Wednesday and would be remembered at a prayer meeting at India Habitat Centre, New Delhi, on Thursday.

 Asma (66) died of a cardiac arrest on February 11. Hundreds of people, mainly women, attended her funeral in Lahore. In her memory,   (PPS) got a big hoarding installed at the upscale   in Lahore, with a message for the woman known for taking on the mightiest in Pakistan: “All of the world salutes you.”
 
 A remembrance prayer will be convened by Pakistan-India Peoples’ Forum for Peace and Democracy (PIPFPD) at the India Habitat Centre, New Delhi. Several academicians and rights activists are expected to attend it. “Asma was an inspiration and a big votary of softening of relations between Pakistan and India. During her many visits to India, she used to say both governments should negotiate at least for people-to-people contact. She was a founding member of PIPFPD, which was established in 1994,” said PIPFPD national committee member Vijayan M J.
 
 A retired teacher of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Professor Chaman Lal, said the outpouring of grief for Asma in Indian and Pakistan clearly showed that bonds between people of the two countries ran deeper than diplomatic relations between their governments. “She never backed out from posing tough questions to politicians, be it in India or Pakistan,” Lal said. 
 
 A lawyer practising in the Lahore high court, Imtiaz Rashid Qureshi, said they had organised prayers in her memory too. “She was not just an activist, but a brilliant lawyer too. She acted remarkably during Zia-ul-Haq regime while leading the Women Action Forum (WAF) and as a leading figure in   (MRD),” said Qureshi.
