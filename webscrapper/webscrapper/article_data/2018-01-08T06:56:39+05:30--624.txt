CHENNAI: The city recorded its coldest night this season on Saturday, as the temperature dropped by nearly 19Celsius over a week.

 The minimum temperature (recorded just before sunrise), was 19C, compared to 22.7C a week earlier, the Met office said on Sunday. At Meenambakkam, the minimum temperature fell to 18.2C.
 
 Weathermen attributed the drop in temperature to the reversal of winds from easterly to north-north westerly.   of Skymet Weather said, “The drop in temperature is due to winds from the cold northern and northwestern parts of the country. The inland winds may persist until Tuesday night before wind direction changes again. When the easterly and north easterly winds resume, the temperature will be back to normal.” 
 
 The minimum temperature recorded at Meenambakkam was nearly 1C lower than the figure recorded at Nungambakkam. Weathermen said that this is due to the fact that Meenambakkam is 8km to 9km away from the sea, while   is just 4km from the coast. 
 
 During January, the city experiences an average maximum and minimum temperature of 29.3C and 21.2C at Nungambakkam.
 
  The Met office has forecast partly cloudy skies on Monday with little to no possibility of rainfall. Monday’s maximum temperature is likely to be 29C and the day’s minimum 19C, the Met office said.
