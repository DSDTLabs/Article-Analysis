MOHALI: Mayor   termed the   as ‘jadoo ki chhadi’ (magic stick) while explaining the salient features of the machine at the MC house meet on Monday. The issue came up for discussion when deputy mayor   pitched in to take possession of the tree pruning machine as the mayor has already won the case against the local bodies. Also, the point to grant Rs 1.16 crore issued by the government to clean the N-choe was discussed by the councillors.

 Mayor Kulwant Singh said, “We have been granted a budget of Rs 1.17 crore to clean the wild growth and garbage in   by the government, but the amount sanctioned to purchase the tree pruning machine is still pending. But the tree pruning machine is ‘jadoo ki chhadi’ as it is capable of carrying out multiple tasks. As per my calculation, this machine can save Rs 60 to Rs 70 lakh if used to clear the wild growth and garbage in N-choe.”
 
 Mayor said this machine is capable of cutting, crushing, stacking and spreading the wild growth within a few days, which might take months if cut manually. This will save labour cost and other costs required to clean the wild growth. “This is why I have termed this machine as ‘jadoo ki chhadi’. This machine is capable of multitasking and will save both time and money,” said the mayor.
 
 The councillors were of the opinion that MC must arrange for the demonstration of the machine for the councillors as well as media so that the point could be proved practically.
