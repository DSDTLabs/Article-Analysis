CHENNAI: The temperature have been steadily soaring over the past week and city residents will have to brace up for warmer days. The weatherman says the days will continue to be   till the end of this month. Maximum temperures during the day gradatures during the day gradually 

 increased in the last one week from 30°C to 35°C.On Wednesday, while areas in the city recorded 32°C, the mercury shot up to 37°C in the suburban areas.
 
 “It is normal for day time temperatures to go up, due to sunlight and clear skies, as the winter season is nearing an end. The temperature will be one or two degrees above normal for the next two days,“ said  , director,   (RMC).
 
 But there is a silver lining. As much as the mercury rises during the day, weather experts said it would drop during the night. RMC has forecast partly cloudy skies for the next two days with maximum and minimum temperatures likely to be around 33°C and 23°C.
 
 Private weather agencies have observed that the rise in temperature was also due to the lack of winds blowing towards Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu, though temperatures had reduced in states like Maharashtra.
 
 “Temperatures were almost six to seven degrees above normal in the north western states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and Maharashtra. Though it has now reduced to about 3 to 4 degrees above normal, the winds are penetrating through states like AP and Telangana. That's also why we are seeing a rise in temperature,“ explained Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist, Skymet Weather.
 
 “The temperature will continue to rise during the day in the coming days.“
 
 The proximity to the sea is also not going to help, as it will only increase the humidity levels.
 
 Experts say the southern districts of the state may experience light showers over the weekend due to a trough that has formed over the Bay of Bengal near Sri Lanka. It may, however, not have any impact on Chennai.
