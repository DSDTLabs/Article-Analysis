PANAJI: Four legislators rubbing shoulders in the 40-member house in 1990s was a purple patch for women in Goa’s political history, but the chief minister’s mantle may elude them after Shashikala Kakodkar’s stroke of luck in late 1970s.

 After the first poll in 1963, one or two women members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) have been invariably elected in each of the last 12 elections, barring 1980 and 1989. 
 
 But women’s role in the state’s higher level politics is considered minimal, indicating that the gender gap remains and their empowerment as enshrined in the constitution is yet to be satisfactorily achieved, say sources.
 
 The 1994 polls remain one of the brighter patches for women’s political empowerment as Shashikala Kakodkar of the   (MGP),   (independent), and Sangeeta Parab and Fatima D’Sa of   won and even occupied cabinet posts, albeit for short terms.
 
 “Though we were from different parties, we functioned independently during our term and highlighted issues related to women’s problems,” says former   D’Sa. 
 
 The 1963 election was a historic one with seven women contesting and Urminda Lima Leitao Mascarenhas achieving the distinction of being the first woman MLA in assembly. 
 
 In the second election in 1967, only two women candidates contested and both emerged victoriousShashikala Kakodkar and Elu Miranda. Kakodkar later consolidated her position as a prominent figure in Goa’s political landscape for many years. 
 
 When her father, chief minister D B Bandodkar, died on August 12, 1973, she took over his mantle till 1979, becoming the first and only woman to hold the post. 
 
 Goa assembly witnessed male-dominated politics for almost a decade. In a twist to her political fortunes, Kakodkar lost two successive elections in 1980 and 1984. That was when nobody else won either.
 
 With 19 women in the fray in the 2017 polls, the results on Saturday will throw light on women’s status in the assembly.
