PUNE: Over 9,000 residents of   and   areas had a trying time combating the rising heat on Tuesday when they were hit by a power cut in rotation for around three hours.

 A statement issued by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd said road digging by Pune Municipal Corporation cut four 22 KV underground cables disrupting power supply to several areas.
 
 The civic body is digging the road in Yerawada to lay a drainage pipeline. The road digging cut four underground cables which disrupted power supply to Naidu sub-station. “Only one supply line to the sub-station was intact and was unable to take the load. This led to tripping of six supply lines of 11 KV and three of 22 KV,” the statement added.
 
 Distribution company officials said there was no option but to effect load-shedding by rotation for three hours in areas on Tadiwala Road, Dhole Patil Road, Mangaldas Road, Naylor Road, Private Road, RTO office area, Ladakatwadi, Sohrab Hall, Bund Garden Road and Boat Club Road.
 
 “Repairs are still on and the work of rejoining the cables at eight locations will be completed late in the night,” an official said.
