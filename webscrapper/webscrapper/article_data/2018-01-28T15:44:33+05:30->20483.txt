I first met Benudi in 1995 on the sets of the serial, Ghum Nei, where she was my coactor. We went on to work together in the film,  , and I got the honour of directing her in our cookery show,  . What an amazing woman of substance she was! 
The whole crew used to wait for her as she used to tell us stories about  . And in her show, she used to make sure that the dishes were cooked properly so that the crew could have them; she even served them herself. She often cooked Uttam Kumar’s favourite dishes like doi begun, chicken roast and many more on the show. I once requested her to share the letters her husband had written to her to use in our montage shot. She agreed reluctantly. And when I went to her home, I was stunned to see how she had kept the letters — each filed with care without a single crease! For her, family was above everything else.
