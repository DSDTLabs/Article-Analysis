Thanks to beauty bloggers, new make-up and hairstyling terms keep getting added to our beauty bible. Here’s where you savvy up...

 
 
 Move over ombre, the brunette-blonde midpoint is the most-hot hair hue this season. This colour expertly mixes the rich natural tones of brunette with lighter, brighter, blonde hues. For more pointers, check out the manes of Blake Lively or Suki Waterhouse who are rocking the look right now. This is a perfect colour for warmer skin tones.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 To make sure their carefully coiffed manes stand the test of time, women are now getting Botox injections to stop their scalp from sweating. According to appearance medicine clinics, Botox injected into the scalp prevents sweat from ruining salon treatments, especially while they workout.
 
 
 The new sombre (subtle-ombre) babylights are ultra-fine, natural-looking highlights that mimic the sun-kissed tones of your hair. Babylights are a great way to customise your colour into a softer grow out. The best bit: there’s no type of hair that can’t rock this trend.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 This trend owes its popularity to Instagram bloggers. Here you use shades of blue for your eye shadow. Achieve the aquatic look by playing with different powders, paints and scale stencils to create shiny scales and fins. Use greens and blues as primary colours and embellish them with glitter, jewels, pearls and faux starfish.
 
 
 
 This requires you to paint your face like a clown to get a flawless finish. This trending technique with the hashtag #ClownContouring is no less than a form of art. It was started by beauty vlogger BellaDeLune who originally posted a video in response to the trolls which called her a “clown” for her regular contoured make-up.
