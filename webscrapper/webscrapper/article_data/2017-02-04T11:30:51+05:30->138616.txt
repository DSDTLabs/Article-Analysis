MUMBAI: In a grandiose makeover of the first public building to be erected by the British in Mumbai, the massive neo-classical  , whose broad flight of 30 ste-ps and massive Doric colum-ns lead you into the  ,  , the Maharashtra Women’s Association and the court fee stamp office, has been restored to its 200-year-old glory.

 Decline of the grade I heritage structure—roof leakages, cracks in the timber, rotting roof valley gutters and a host of structural distress—had prompted its refurbishing in 2009, the first time since 1883 when it was built. 
 
 Carried out in several phases on a budget of Rs 9 crore, the original building material were tested in a laboratory before   began. From renewal of historic plasterwork using lime mortar mixed with horse hair and jaggery to timber for the roof imported from Myanmar and specialized artisans from the Northeast to carve on wood and stone, every part from the roof and the facade to the flooring and the furniture were repaired and restored to its original splendour.
 
 “Each corner has received a fresh and authentic lease of life that should last for at least another 100 years. It will be opened out to the public by the end of this month,” said Shrinivas G Sulge, managing director of Laxmi Hericon, the firm executing the restoration work.
