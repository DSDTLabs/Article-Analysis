DEHRADUN: Some leaders in the state unit of the   are miffed after four election vehicles that will carry the message of the party to voters across 13 districts have been designed with only chief minister Harish Rawat’s face in a large cut-out and no other local leader visible.
 
  Congress workers said that this is in contradiction to the message displayed on the political raths which stresses on unity and reads, ‘Main nahi Hum’ (Not me, us).
  
  The election vehicles were flagged off by the CM on Wednesday. Rawat’s blown-up images amid a yellow backdrop cover all sides of the vehicles. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and party vice-president   are the only two leaders whose photographs have also found space on the vehicle. The pictures, however, are nowhere near as prominent as those of Rawat.
  
  One side of the vehicle also lists the projects initiated and completed by the Congress government in the state.
  
  A Congress leader on condition of anonymity said, “The rath symbolizes brotherhood and unity but with only Rawat’s pictures it reflects a one-man-show in Uttarakhand.”
  
  Another senior leader added, “I do not want to comment on the issue but more faces should have featured on the posters if the party wants to present a message of unity to voters.”
  
  When contacted, Congress state chief   told TOI, “I came to know from some party workers about the issue. I am not aware who got the vehicles designed.”
  
   , media advisor to the CM, said that the vehicles have been donated by a party supporter.
