VELLOR: Union minister of state for home affairs   on Sunday said that the government would complete installing smart fencing along the entire stretch of Indo-Pak and Indo-Bangladesh borders by the end of 2018 or early 2019 to prevent infiltration and crossing over of illegal migrants. He said that the country’s border is much more safe and secure than it was four years ago.

 Rijiju also said that the union government was planning to entrust VIP security to   (CISF) which is hitherto entrusted to safeguard vital installations and major airports.
 
 Speaking on the sidelines of the passing out parade of second all-lady constable trainees’ battalion of the 40th batch at the Regional Training Centre of CISF at   on Sunday, Rijiju said “The country has so many borders and coastal boundaries. It shares the border with Pakistan in the western front where there are maximum incidents of infiltration of extremists, especially in the LoC. Hence the government has stepped up vigilance and deployed smart border management as the government is keen on using technology.”
