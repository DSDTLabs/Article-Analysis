MUMBAI: “We depend on our dogs more than machines to trace humans buried under debris,“ said duty commandant   (NDRF) who led the rescue operation at the   site.

 The two labrador sniffer dogs--Uday and Pinki--were part for the 45-member NDRF team that rushed to the   building collapse site after receiving a call at 11am on Tuesday.
 
 Mahesh Nalwade, deputy commandant of NDRF, said, “The dogs have a 40 times stronger sense of smell than humans. Our dog team members helped us to accurately identify the victims' location in the debris, after which we used advanced equipment attached with cameras to find their position.We then began to remove the blockage with cutters reach them.“
 
 Uday and Pinki pointed out the locations by barking.
 
 One the  's request, NDRF stationed three teams at   (each team comprised 45 rescue workers) to reduce travel time.
