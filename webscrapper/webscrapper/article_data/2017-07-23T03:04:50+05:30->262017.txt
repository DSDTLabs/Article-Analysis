SRINAGAR: In a reflection of how jagged the security forces’ nerves are in the violence-ridden Kashmir valley,   soldiers on Saturday thrashed J&K cops, who are otherwise their brothers-in-arms in all counter-insurgency operations.

 Seven policemen including an assistant sub-inspector were injured when soldiers in civvies thrashed them on Friday evening following a squabble at a checkpost in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district, police said. Police registered a case of assault against the soldiers of 24 Rashtriya Rifles (RR) unit of the Army.
 
 The incident took place when private vehicles, carrying soldiers in civil dress, were returning from the Baltal base camp of the Amarnath yatra, past 2am and were signalled to stop at the Sonamarg checkpost. The cops tried to stop the soldiers, Ganderbal SSP Fayaz Ahmad Lone said.
 
 Movement of civilians at night is not allowed as a security measure for the ongoing Amarnath yatra.
 
 Since the vehicles did not stop, the policemen at Sonamarg sent a message to the next checkpost at Gund to stop the vehicles, sources said.
 
 At Gund checkpost, the soldiers’ vehicles were stopped that led to an altercation following which the soldiers called their colleagues from the 24 Rashtriya Rifles (RR) unit of the Army, who reached the spot and thrashed the cops, police said.
 
 Fayaz alleged that the soldiers then barged into the Gund police station and ransacked it and assaulted the on-duty policemen too.
 
 Director General of Police, Jammu & Kashmir, S P Vaid, took up the matter with the Corps Commander of the Army’s Chinar Corps, Lieutenant General J S Sandhu. The Army has also initiated an inquiry. A case has been registered against the group of unknown Army personnel at two police stations.
 
 But defence spokesman Col Rajesh Kalia said, “The matter was resolved by the personal intervention of senior officers. Measures to prevent reoccurrence have been taken.”
