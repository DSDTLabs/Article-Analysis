PATNA: The   district administration has decided to crack down on illegal   manufacturing units following Thursday night’s fire and subsequent explosion in one such factory in which six people, including three minors, died and 20 others were injured. Police may soon raid the places where raw materials used for manufacturing firecrackers are being stored. Retail shops selling firecrackers are also under police scanner.

 Nalanda DM S M Thiyagarajan on Saturday said FIRs would be lodged against retailers and others if they were found involved in storing or manufacturing illegal firecrackers.
 
 The Thursday night’s fire, which claimed six lives, had erupted in an illegal firecracker factory which was being operated from a residential building at Khasganj under Sohsarai police station area in the district. Three neighbouring houses also caved in due to the explosion.
 
 The house in question was owned by one Zahida   (45), while the factory was being run by one Sarfaraz  , who died in the explosion along with his two daughters, a son and a sister. Zahida was also injured in the blast.
 
 DIG (central range)  , who visited the spot on Friday, said such was the intensity of the explosion that it damaged rooftop water tanks of at least six neighbouring residential buildings, besides shattering their windowpanes. 
 
 Kumar, who is probing the explosion along with Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor, said 40kg of raw materials and two sacks of crackers were removed from the spot.
 
  probe sought:   state spokesperson   on Saturday demanded NIA probe into the explosion in an illegal firecracker factory at Biharsharif on Thursday night. “It was not an ordinary case. The high-intensity explosion demolished four buildings and killed at least six people and injured several others,” he said.
