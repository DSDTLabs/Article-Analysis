 An MoEF clearance was always considered the toughest among the four main permissions required for the Rs 4,000 crore project, the others being wildlife, forest and eco-sensitive zone clearances. The BMC expects these to be granted on the grounds that GMLR’s section through the SGNP is to be a tunnel through a hill and as such will have no impact on the forest. Construction of the tunnel alone is expected to cost Rs 3,000 crore.
 
 On why MoEF clearance won’t be required, additional municipal commissioner (projects)   said, “GMLR will be a Development Plan road and is neither a national nor a state highway in need of expansion. Also, it does not connect the Eastern and Western Express Highways directly. Hence, an MoEF clearance is not necessary.” Last month, the BMC wrote to MoEF’s expert appraisal committee ( ), seeking permission for withdrawing its request for environmental clearance for the project as per the Environment (Protection ) Rules, 2006.
