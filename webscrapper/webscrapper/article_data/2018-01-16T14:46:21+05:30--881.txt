Earlier this month, after the flamingos arrived at  , the   government conducted an eponymous festival which saw bird enthusiasts flocking to  . The Andhra Pradesh government had spent more than Rs 5 crore on the festival – it had laid approach roads to the venue and organised cultural events by roping in artists.

 On the other side of the lake, which falls under Tamil Nadu’s jurisdiction, the flamingos pecked at the water, preened, dried their wings and flapped away into the air – but the intense avian activity could not shake the state out of its slumber. Unlike Andhra Pradesh, which is attempting to exploit the potential of Pulicat Lake as an eco-tourism destination,   is yet to make any of the right noises. The lagoon, 54km from the city, is a seasonal home to several migratory birds. Ornithologists say the greater and lesser flamingos spend more time in the mudflats on the TN side than in Andhra Pradesh. The winged visitors spend most of their time at  , a village in the area, and stay there for more than four months.
 
 T Murugavel, founder of   (EMAI), said some rare birds visiting Pulicat are seen only on the TN waters. “The southern part of Pulicat mostly never gets dry. The mudflats here attract a great number of plovers and waders. Birds like oystercatcher, curlew are more often sighted here than in the northern side as it dries up quickly due to the natural inclination of the land, and silt and sediments blockage,” he said.
 
 Chennai-based photographer   said Pulicat is a paradise for birders and photographers. “The background has no disturbance and makes it perfect for photography during dawn and dusk,” he said.
 
 Chennai wildlife warden   said they had received proposals from the district administration to conduct eco-tourism. “The wildlife officials have agreed. But no permanent structures should be created in the ecologically fragile backwaters. With this condition they were given by the nod by the department,” she said.
