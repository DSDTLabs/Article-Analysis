MARGAO: Agriculturists from Manora and Arlem in Raia village in Salcete, on Saturday, once again demanded a permanent soultion to the fields getting choked due to release of sewage water through nullahs.

 It may be recalled that on February 22, this group of agitating farmers, under the banner of Raia Farmer Club and led by their president  , staged a protest at the Arlem main junction. They issued the authorities a two-day deadline to immediately fix the problem, threatened to intensify their agitation otherwise.
 
 Stating that this was the fourth occasion that they were facing such a problem, Fernandes told STOI that on February 7, he had written to various authorities, such as the PWD sewerage department works division XXI,   (GSPCB), health department, Raia village panchayat, block development officer (BDO) and the   collector regarding the problem.
 
 Curtorim MLA  , who met the farmers and extended his support, tried to resolve the issue by summoning the PWD sewerage department works division XXI officials. A meeting with all the authorities concerned, including the Lotoulim primary centre (PHC) health officials, has been convened on Monday, February 6. A site inspection will be done on Thursday, March 9, said Fernandes.
 
 Fernandes said, “The water in the wells of their fields had turned black and now been sent for testing. The farmers seek a permanent solution to their problem as PWD sewerage department assistant engineer Prakash Pai had only cleared up the chocked sewerage after their last protest.”
