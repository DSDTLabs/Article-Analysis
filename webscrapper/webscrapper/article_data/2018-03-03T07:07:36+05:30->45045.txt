SALEM: Two   in the physics department of   herewere hospitalised with injuries after they came to blows on the campus on Friday. P  , head of the department, and P M  , professor, later lodged separate complaints with the Suramangalam police.

 
 Kumaradhas joined the department a decade ago, three months ahead of Anbarasan. However, Anbarasan got promoted as professor before Kumaradhas as per hiscareer and paper publications. “Anbarasan was expecting the HoD post as he got promoted as professor from associate professor,” a senior professor in the department told TOI. When Kumaradhas became the HoD based on his seniority, it created enmity between the two, the professor said.
 
 
 Sources in the university said Kumaradhas and Anbarasan often got into wordy duels even for petty issues. On Friday, Anbarasan noted his date of joining and seniority in the attendance register, though it was not mandatory. Annoyed at this, Kumaradhas demanded to know why it was mentioned in the register. Anbarasan came up with an angry retort, triggering a furious argument. Soon, the two men began assaulting each other with sandals.
 
 
 Fellow professors and lecturers separated them. Kumaradhas was admitted to the government medical college hospital in   city while Anbarasan was admitted to a private hospital. Police have registered a case based on their complaints.
 
 
 Talking to reporters later, Kumaradhas said it was Anbarasan who had attacked him first with his shoes. When contacted, Anbarasan said he would send his version of the incident through WhatsApp. However, he sent only an evening Tamil daily’s paper cutting and requested TOI to take it as his version.
