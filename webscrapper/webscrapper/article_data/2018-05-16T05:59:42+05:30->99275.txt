CHENNAI: The   (SHRC) on Tuesday directed the government to pay 1 lakh in compensation to a man who charged a police inspector with threatening him at gunpoint to demand a bribe. 

 SHRC member  , who issued the direction, said the government could recover the compensation from the inspector.
 
 Textile businessman A Ali Akbar said a   district court had granted him bail in a criminal case but directed him to appear before the inspector at   police station at 5pm every day.
 
 As he was leaving the police station on September 7, 2013, inspector   summoned him, Akbar said.
 
 "The inspector demanded that I pay a bribe of 80,000, failing which, he said he would foist a rape charge against me and put me in jail." he said. "When I refused to pay the bribe, the inspector threatened me at gunpoint and assaulted me in front of my wife." 
 
 Denying the allegation, inspector Saravanan stated that he was not on duty on the day Akbar charged him with threatening him at gunpoint. Akbar filed a false complaint against him to bypass the bail conditions, the inspector said.
 
 Refusing to concur with the submission, the commission directed the government to pay the compensation within a month.
