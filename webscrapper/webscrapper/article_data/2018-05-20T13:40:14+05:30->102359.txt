Actress   said she has more respect for her husband and actor   since working with him on  .

  
  
 Asked her favourite co-star, she said, "Well I have to pick my husband. I would not want to not pick him. He is my favourite, obviously. We had a really fun time (on 'Grimsby'). We shared a trailer. And it was just hilarious. Obviously I always respected him, but having been around so many big comedy stars and seeing how they improvise and stuff - and then to work with my husband and see him be the best improv comedian I've ever worked with, I loved it."
 
 According to a report, though the   star said being a working mother is tough, she feels lucky to have a job that offers so much flexibility.
 
 She said, "It's a juggling act and most of the time I feel like the ball is just rolling on the ground - there's not even one in the air. But I've realised how fortunate I am that I chosen an occupation that's so family friendly. Obviously you don't want to pull tiny people out of school and drag them to the other end of the Earth on a whim to play a role. But you've got a trailer on set and you can all be together in a way that you possibly can't be if you're a doctor working long hours, or if you're a nurse of school teacher."
