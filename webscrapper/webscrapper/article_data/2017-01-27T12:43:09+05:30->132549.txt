MANGALURU: Clamour to hold buffalo race ‘Kambala’ in coastal Karnataka grew louder with thousands of students, actors from Tulu film industry and people representative irrespective of political parties forming a human chain to support local sport, in heart of Mangaluru, here on Friday.

 Agitators demanded ban on   and criticised that it has failed to understand difference between Jallikattu held in Tamil Nadu and Kambala in coastal Karnataka. 
 
 Students, after boycotting their classes on Friday, had gathered in a big number to voice out their support to Kambala, which is held from several centuries in the coastal belt.
 
 Addressing the protesters, Nalin Kumar Kateel, MP,  , said, “Kambala is a traditional sport of Tulunadu and without understanding the difference between Jalikattu and Kambala, PETA had filed a petition to ban Kambala. They should know that there is no cruel treatment given to bovines during the sport. We all should join hands and intensify our Protest until the ban on Kambala lifted”.
 
 The other organisation that took part in the protest included right wing activists and student organisations.
