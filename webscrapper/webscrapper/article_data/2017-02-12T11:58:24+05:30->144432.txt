ROORKEE: Stating that BJP’s pledge is to make Uttarakhand youth self-dependent, Union textiles minister Smriti Irani said on Saturday that if BJP comes to power in the hill state, it will provide free education till post-graduation to poor students of the state. Addressing a rally here, Irani said that loan of Rs one crore will also be sanctioned to a person who desires to start his/her business.
 
  “Youth of this state demands only two things for his/her development, and these are education and means of minimum livelihood. If we come to power, we will provide free education to the level of post graduation (PG) to poor students, and for those who wish to start their business, we will give them loan of Rs one crore,” the minister said.
  
  Criticising the Harish Rawat government, Irani said that Congress has failed to provide development in the state. “Modi government at the Centre has initiated various schemes to uplift every person of the society. These schemes were implemented by state governments in their state. But chief minister Harish Rawat did not execute any people-centric welfare schemes in Uttarakhand. Residents are fed up with Congress and are now demanding for change,” she said.
  
  “Modi-government has started various schemes for every person, be it labourers from unorganized sectors, widows, girls, youth or be it provision for minimum wage. Ask the current Congress government, if they have implemented such schemes for people,” the union minster added.
  
  Irani was here to support Roorkee BJP candidate Pradeep Batra.
