MARGAO: The   gram sabha on Sunday reiterated their opposition to the proposed state highway 8 by undertaking road widening of the internal village roads.

 Chandor deputy sarpanch   told TOI that the gram sabha members have requested the panchayat to write to chief minister Manohar   stating their objection and demanding that the village roads be retained without being widening as that would affect many ancient structures. They also want to draw Parrikar’s attention to the potholed state of the roads that need urgent tarring work.
 
 “There were no discussions on the annual budget and audit report as it pertains to the former panchayat members and the current panchayat members were not prepared for the same. Hence, it was decided that a special gram sabha will be convened to discuss this subject,” said Martins.
