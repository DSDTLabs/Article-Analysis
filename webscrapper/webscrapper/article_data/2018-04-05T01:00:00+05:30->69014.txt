The political drama ' ', based on the book by Sanjaya Baru, commenced principal photography in London on Monday. The film, which features   in the lead role, traces the making and unmaking of the former Prime Minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh. Ever since the first poster of the movie released a few months ago, the striking resemblance between the veteran actor and the former PM has become a talking point.

 Speaking about the project, Anupam Kher said, “The opportunity to portray a contemporary personality like 
 
 Dr Manmohan Singh in 'The Accidental Prime Minister' is an immense challenge for me as an actor. He is part of the 24/7 media era, and the world knows his persona minutely. I have been internalising this character for the past few months. I look forward to translating that effort into cinematic reality.”
 
 The movie is directed by debutant Vijay Ratnakar Gutte, along with   as the creative producer and also features Akshaye Khanna as Sanjaya Baru, the former media advisor to the PM. The script is written by Mayank Tewari, who recently won the Asian Film Awards for India’s official Oscar’s entry, Newton.
 
 'The Accidental Prime Minister', produced by Bohra Bros, is slated to release on December 21, 2018.
