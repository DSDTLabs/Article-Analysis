NAGPUR:   officials are upping the ante in their annual campaign against exam malpractices by coordinating with exam centres that have CCTVs installed. All such centres have been directed by Nagpur divisional board to ensure that CCTVs are functional and that footage is not deleted for at least a month.

 Shriram  , divisional board secretary, said, “In our meeting with schools and junior colleges, it has been made clear that CCTVs now have to be an integral part of the anti-copying measures.”
 
 The 2017-18 board exam season kicks off from Wednesday with HSc’s English subject. With almost 67,000 students appearing for the exams, the board officials want to ensure that the entire event rolls out smoothly.
 
 “Our flying squads will be in place to keep strict vigil on centres. Technology is being leveraged for this through the   system, so that it gives us an added advantage in the fight against copycats,” said Chavhan. 
 
 CCTV footage will pay a big role in making board’s cases foolproof when a student is reported for malpractice. The flying squads also include a videographer to document everything as an added layer of security.
 
 The board has also asked all exam centre supervisors to keep in touch through landline as invigilators and local teachers cannot use mobile phones. “But the centre supervisor’s mobile phone will be on to contact us in case of emergency. Our information booklet has mentioned that landlines must be used but sometimes these connections are not functional, so it’s a risk,” said Chavhan.
