AHMEDABAD: The   for postgraduate (PG) medical courses, which was scheduled to start on March 25, might be delayed by a week over seat allocation after the   (MCI) increased 660 seats at the all-India level.

 Of the increased seats, the state has been allocated 66. The MCI officials have written a letter to medical colleges across the state but the allocation of the seats — which has to be bifurcated between the state and all-India quotas — created confusion. 
 
 Last year, the PG medical admission procedure was conducted for 1,701 seats which included 950 government college seats. This year, the admission procedure will be conducted for around 1,800 seats. According to sources, students can fill up their admission forms from March 15. After that the merit list will be released according to NEET ( ). Subsequently, the first round of admissions will begin; the entire procedure will be conducted online. The PG medical admission procedure was marred by serious blunders as admissions were granted on one extra seat rather than the total capacity of 1,701. Due to which the entire procedure had to be cancelled and begun anew.
