AHMEDABAD: Owners of self-financed schools on Sunday held a meeting at a private club on   and demanded clarity on the fee structure by May before the schools open for the next semester in June. 

 Owners of more than 150 self-financed schools and 40 priests who run various ‘gurukuls’ across the state also participated in the meeting. The schools demanded that the state government issue a   (GR) before May so that parents and schools know the exact fee amount to be charged.
 
 More than 12,000 private self-financed schools have been brought under the ambit of the recently introduced Gujarat Self-Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees)-2017 bill which puts a cap on school fees.
 
 The bill fixes the upper limit for primary school fees at Rs 15,000; secondary schools at 25,000; and higher secondary schools at Rs 27,000. 
 
 Pravin Kachhadia, president of All Gujarat Self-Financed  , said they want a solution that neither harms the parents nor the school-owners. “We want to cooperate with the state government but it should specify the fee amount to avoid any conflict in the future,” Kachhadia said.
