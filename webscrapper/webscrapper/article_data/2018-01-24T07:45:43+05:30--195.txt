BENGALURU:   have suddenly come up on several  , including in the heart of the city.   say these have been installed to stop people from running across, often putting their lives at risk.

 But several citizens and town planning experts that TOI spoke to said the BBMP has done a shoddy job in most places, and ruined the aesthetics of the roads.
 
 “They are killing the beauty of Bengaluru. I can understand the need for high medians. On Old Airport Road, people run across even when there is high-speed VIP movement. Police say there have been several close shaves. But these concrete medians are ugly,” says R K Misra, member of chief minister’s vision group on infrastructure.
 
 V Ravichandar, civic planning expert, says medians, along with road signs, are part of street furniture, and should reinforce Brand Bengaluru in terms of aesthetics and performance.
 
 On Old Airport Road, the new high concrete median has come up on what was previously a median that had some greenery. On the Domlur stretch, the medians have already become a convenient surface to paste political posters on. And on this stretch, since there are trees too along the median, there are plenty of gaps through which people can easily cross over.
 
 The high median on Sankey Road is a surprise to many because it’s a stretch that sees little pedestrian crossing, and only serves to mar the beauty of the road that comes from the adjoining golf course. 
 
 Some citizens are upset that there’s no visual consistency in the medians. M G Road has a stone slab median that is one foot in height, Mysuru Road has a concrete median that’s around 4ft high, and Kempapura has a 5ft-high iron grill median. “When pavements are beginning to look similar under the TenderSure model, why can’t the medians look the same across the city,” asked a resident.
 
 Misra says BBMP contractors do not even have the ability to give the concrete medians a decent finish. He says a rich city like Bengaluru should be using wrought iron railings, like in front of the Vidhana Soudha and high court. “Cheaper metals will rust. And if you really have to use concrete to lower costs, then you should have thinner concrete slabs on the two sides of the median, with greenery in between. The greenery will make it pleasing. This is what Pune and Chennai have done on many of their roads,” he says.
 
 Ravichandar says instead of using concrete, they could use reinforced rubber, so that even if the side of a vehicle grazes it, there is no damage. He says there is a strong case for standardization of medians.
 
 
 
 
 * Pedestrians should only cross at junctions. They should think of their own safety. We will build skywalks where there is a need. Some years ago, we had put a one-metre-high median on Mysuru Road and people were still jumping over it

 * Medians, along with road signs, are part of street furniture, and should reinforce Brand Bengaluru in terms of aesthetics and performance. Currently, there are flaws in design. Instead of using concrete, they can use reinforced rubber, so that even if the side of a vehicle grazes it, there is no damage. There is a strong case for standardization and one metre is a reasonably good height. Medians should be in bright reflective colours like yellow. Pedestrian crossings should be available every 500m. There should at least be flashing lights to alert vehicles that people might be crossing. For instance, between Brigade Road and Anil Kumble Circle, there should be one flashing signal.

 * Aesthetically poor 
 
 * No uniformity in shape and size; confusion for drivers
 
 * No provision for pedestrian crossing
 
 * Not easy for emergency vehicles in case of slow-moving traffic or gridlocks
 
 * Doesn’t allow water to pass through, could cause water stagnation during rains
