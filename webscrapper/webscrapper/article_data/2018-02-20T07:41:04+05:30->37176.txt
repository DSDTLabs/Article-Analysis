BATHINDA: Lambi police, on Monday, stopped nearly 50 anganwadi workers and helpers from visiting the residence of Punjab finance minister   at his native village Badal in Muktsar district. 

 Anganwadi workers' union president   said, "The protest aimed at highlighting our issues. But, cops misbehaved with our workers and helpers. Many of them were detained for trying to burn the government effigy." 
 
 Muktsar SSP   said, "No case has been registered and no anganwadi worker arrested. They were only stopped from burning the government's effigy."
