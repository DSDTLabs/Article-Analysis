PUNE: The   down the 25-year-old software engineer,  , is   two days after the hit-and-run accident in Bhosari.

 The private CCTV cameras at the spot where Mete was knocked had been defunct over the past one week for some renovation work. The Bhosari MIDC police are now hoping to get the details of the   from the CCTV cameras installed at the entrances of some companies on that road.
 
 “The owner of the defunct CCTV cameras told us the cameras were disconnected because of renovation work in the watchman’s cabin,” an officer of the Bhosari MIDC said.
 
 Prabhakar Mete, the father of the victim, said, “It is beyond imagination that my son was lying there for such a long time and the people there, instead of helping him reach hospital, were clicking his photographs and recording videos. It is an act of heartlessness. Had any one of them shown some courtesy to help my son, he would have been alive today.” 
 
 Sarjearo Mete, the cousin of the victim, said, “It is heart wrenching that our family member died without anybody coming forward to take him to a hospital.”
 
 An officer of the Bhosari MIDC police said the police did not know how the accident occurred. “The hospital authorities informed the police about the accident,” he said, adding that prima facie probe revealed that Mete died because of severe head injuries as he was not wearing a helmet.
 
 In the absence of   from the cameras installed near the accident spot, the police had to obtain the footage from the cameras located at some distance. “The footage from these cameras did not yield any result. Now we will check the CCTV cameras on the entire stretch of the road,” he added.
 
 Sub-inspector V S Mule of the Bhosari MIDC police, who is probing the case, said if there are any eyewitnesses, they should share the details of the vehicle with the police.
