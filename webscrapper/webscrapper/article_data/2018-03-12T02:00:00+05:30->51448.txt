PATNA: With the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) virtually failing to curb breeding of mosquitoes in various localities of the city, people are at the receiving end here. Despite using all types of repellents, residents of the city are experiencing disturbed sleep due to   bites even during the daytime.

 The PMC is using only 10 vehicle-mounted fogging machines and 35 hand-held small machines, which are not enough to carry out daily fogging in 75 wards. “The fogging is being carried out on a roster basis. All the executive officers have been asked to increase the frequency of fogging in each locality,” deputy municipal commissioner Vishal Anand said.
 
 Sources, however, said most of the hand-held machines are lying defunct. “Even the state health department is far from using medicines in drains and other stagnant water bodies to kill the mosquito larvae which cause diseases like malaria, dengue, chikungunya and filariasis. The PMC, it seems, is sleeping. Its tall claims of carrying out regular fogging have fallen flat,” said Saima Imam, a resident of Indrapuri.
 
 Magistrate Colony resident Anita Sharma said with the advent of summer, the number of mosquitoes has increased manifold in her locality. “The mosquitoes keep troubling us round-the-clock,” she said, adding effective control of mosquito menace is not possible until appropriate steps are taken to keep residential areasclean.
