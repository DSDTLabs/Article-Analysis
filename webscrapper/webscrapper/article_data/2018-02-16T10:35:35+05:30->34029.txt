NEW DELHI: Hari Prasad S V blew the whistle on alleged irregularities in the diamond business of Mehul   one-and-a-half years ago but was ignored. He told TOI that had the   acted on his complaint of July 2016, the PNB scam would have been unearthed long back. “We are still suffering from the fraud perpetrated by these people. 

 They are so powerful with money and muscle that ordinary people cannot fight them,” he said. Prasad said his complaint to PMO was about alleged irregularities in Choksi’s Gitanjali group. Asked by TOI, Prasad clarified that his complaint was not about Nirav Modi but about Choksi, a business partner of the former. 
 
 However, Nirav was not a partner in   group. Prasad, a businessman from Bengaluru, said he had “business dealings” with Gitanjali group and was “cheated of Rs 13 crore”. In his complaint, Prasad detailed the way Choksi had milked banks for loans on meagre assets, warning that the country would be saddled with large NPAs if action was not taken. 
 
 He pointed out “deficiencies in balance sheets” of the company and submitted a list of 31 banks which had extended loans to Gitanjali group. “This company has taken huge loans to the tune of almost Rs 9,872 crore with meagre assets of just Rs 25-30 crore and (is) definitely going to become NPA soon,” he wrote in his complaint.
