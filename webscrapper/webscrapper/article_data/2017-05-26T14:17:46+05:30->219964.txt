 is arguably one of the fast-rising stars in Mollywood and what sets the actor apart from a lot of the others, is that he is willing to go any distance to make his character stand out.

 For his recent superhit movie  , the actor had trained in wrestling and his previous film  , he put on weight to play a 40-plus engineer.
 
 In a recent interview, the actor made it clear that he is willing to do anything to make sure that the film is good. The actor answered a question if his wife had any qualms about him doing romantic scenes, and that’s when he said, “We already had this discussion and I told her I don’t want to limit myself. I am willing to do even a   scene if the script demands it.”
 
 The Godha actor also said that he consider kissing onscreen “dumbest thing”.
