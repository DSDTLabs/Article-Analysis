Tirupur: The district administration has urged the people to use the services of 292 government e-service centres to get documents.

 Apart from regular five certificates - community certificate, income certificate, residential certificate, first graduate certificate, and deserted wife certificate, the centres have started to issue 20 more certificates, including micro and small farmer certificate and inter-caste marriage certificate, from March 23. Besides, other services including application for e-ration cards and its corrections can also be done in the centres. Collector K S Palanisamy said, “Once the application was registered, a SMS would reach the applicant as acknowledgement. Again when the certificate was ready, the registered mobile number will receive information with online link. The applicants can download the certificate either directly or can obtain it from e-service centres.” tnn
