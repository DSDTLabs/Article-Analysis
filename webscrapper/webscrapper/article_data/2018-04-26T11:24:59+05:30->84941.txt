HYDERABAD: In 2017, Telangana could have reported at least 35-40   deaths, most of them from Hyderabad. Yet, not one gets reflected in the data complied under the   and family welfare’s ‘National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme’. While it pegs the total dengue cases for the year at 3,061, it shows that the state reported no deaths during this period. Similarly, there is no mention of any death caused due to other infectious diseases such as   and   — a claim vehemently debated by health experts. They insist that the deaths, including an estimated 10 related to malaria, went unrecorded.

 
  
 
 
 Their reason: absence of a state-level registry or centralised monitoring system for diseases except cancer and  . According to experts, even the incidence of diseases is largely under-reported in the state, because of the same issue. As a result, the report gives an impression about Telangana faring better than other states in these diseases, even as the reality is far removed, they add.
 
 “While the state identified the need for a robust monitoring system for diseases, data collection has remained on the back seat so far,” said a senior health official, adding how most private hospitals fail to keep the state informed about cases related to infectious diseases. “The poor follow-up process (after a patient is treated and discharged) among hospitals also leads to under-reporting of possible deaths.”
 
 Raising a serious word of caution over this gap in monitoring, experts say that the government must intervene in the matter immediately as it could have long-term implications. “Such data is crucial for public policy, research and prevention of various communicable, infectious and noncommunicable diseases and should be made public each year,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari, president, Helping Hand Foundation, an NGO working in healthcare.
