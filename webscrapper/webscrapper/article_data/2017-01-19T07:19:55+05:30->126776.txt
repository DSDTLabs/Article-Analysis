NEW DELHI:   Vice President   used a torn kurta to make a political point, drawing sarcastic comments on Twitter.

 Displaying a hole in the kurta that he was wearing on Monday, the Congress vice president told the audience at a public meeting in Rishikesh,  , "Mera kurta phata ho toh mujhe farak nahi padta, lekin Modi Ji ka kapda kabhi nahi phata hoga aur woh gareeb ki rajneeti karte hain (It doesn't matter to me if my kurta is torn. But Modiji's clothes must never have been torn and he is indulging in politics of the poor)."
 
 "Rahul showed his torn kurta just returning from his holiday trip from abroad which shows that achhe din have reached ground zero," wrote a sarcastic @dayanidhi_lenka. @vullary tweeted, "He can't afford a new kurta, but a vacation abroad he can happily afford?"
