KOTTAYAM: In a move widely perceived as prelude to the Kerala Congress (M)’s eventual entry into the LDF fold, the party’s candidate won the election for Kottayam district panchayat president with the support of CPM on Wednesday.

 Top Congress leaders accused   and his son Jose K Mani of reneging on a written agreement that the KC-M would support a Congress candidate for the post, an allegation that both Mani and his party spokesman   denied. 
 
 Of the 22-member panchayat committee, KC-M’s   got 12 votes while Congress’   got eight. Both CPM and KC-M have six members each while Congress has eight. The CPI member   abstained from voting, while the vote of P C George's Congress (Secular) member was invalid.
 
 The election was held after panchayath president Joshy Philip was elected as District Congress Committee president. Based on an agreement between the two parties before the   assumed power in the panchayat, Congress was to keep the president’s post for the first half followed by KC-M.
