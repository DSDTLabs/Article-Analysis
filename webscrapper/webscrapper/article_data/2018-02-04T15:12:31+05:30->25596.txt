SURAT: The only helpline for crisis intervention and suicide prevention in the Diamond City has stopped functioning after the telecom service provider migrated to new technology. 

 Hundreds of desperate callers were unable to get in touch with the counsellors as the helpline run jointly by   police and Vanderavala Foundation stopped working in the past few days as   migrated to new technology. A staff of eight counsellors of the helpline provided counselling services to callers suffering from mental issues. 
 
 Thanks to 24x7 mental health crisis intervention helpline, around 250 people in the Diamond City, mostly in the age group of 18-35 years, were counselled to give up their suicidal tendencies ever since it was set up four years ago. It has catered to more than 50,000 calls, around 80 calls per day, mostly related to anxiety, depression, relationship issues, student education problems, especially during exams. 
 
 The 24x7 helpline, which was set up under   initiative, had two centres in the state, one at Surat and the other at Gandhinagar. The Gandhinagar centre that was set up in 2008 has catered to over 3 lakh calls. 
 
  executive director Dr Arun John told TOI, “We sent desperate calls and mails to the telecom service provider, but it seems they are not keen to start the helpline number.”
