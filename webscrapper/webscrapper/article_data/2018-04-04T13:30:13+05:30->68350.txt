 Sources said the ECR had lodged seven FIRs in   division, four each in Sonepur and   divisions and three in Mughalsarai division against the troublemakers. These FIRs were lodged at different RPF posts under the jurisdiction of the ECR. Danapur RPF commandant Chandra Mohan   said seven FIRs were lodged with the RPF posts at Patna Junction, Ara, Jehanabad, Bakhtiarpur, Nawada, Kiul and Barh. The RPF also transferred some cases to the GRP stations in Patna district, Mishra said. 
 
 The RPF personnel have been asked to identify miscreants and bandh supporters who had forcibly stopped mail and express trains and damaged railway property during Monday’s Bharat bandh.
 
 “RPF and GRP officials are scanning video footages to identify the troublemakers,” a senior ECR official said.
 
 “Railways had nothing to do with the bandh. Yet, it was made a soft target by the bandh supporters. Passengers, including senior citizens, elderly women and children faced much hardship due to the agitation,” Danapur DRM Ranjan   said, adding as maintaining law and order was the state government’s responsibility, railways had no choice but to persuade the bandh supporters to clear the tracks in the larger interest of common passengers. “Railway services remained paralysed in the division for 10 hours due to the bandh,” Thakur said.
