JAIPUR: The   Ajeet Singh on Monday directed the special operations group (SOG) to probe the   who was shot dead by unidentified assailants on late Sunday night. The SOG’s role was sought after primary investigation suggested the involvement of notorious gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.

 The SOG team left for Jodhpur late Monday night to probe the case in the backdrop of increasing incidents of organized crimes in Jodhpur city. DGP Ajeet Singh’s intervention comes at a time when the Jodhpur police commissionerate is facing heat for its failure to keep a tight leash on crime syndicates. A highly-placed source informed TOI that Lawrence Bishnoi, a gangster from Punjab, has been targeting Jodhpur in particular, but cops have not made any serious efforts to bust his local network.
 
 “The SOG keeps a tab on all organized crimes and gangs. We don’t believe Israni’s murder was a stray incident. This murder reeks of conspiracy that leads to Bishnoi,” added an official.
 
 The Jodhpur police suspect history-sheeter Harendra Jat to be the prime suspect in the case. “Jat is very close to Lawrence Bishnoi. In fact, intelligence reports in the past had indicated that Bishnoi provided refuge to Jat in Punjab when he was hiding from the police,” said an official.
 
 Bishnoi, a dreaded gangster from Punjab, was brought to Jodhpur from Punjab on warrant after his name cropped up in multiple shooting cases in Jodhpur in March this year. The SOG has brought him from the Ajmer High Security Prison (HSP) to Jaipur. He was grilled for aiding in the murder of a sarpanch in Sikar on August 23.
 
 “During numerous interrogations, he has confessed to his plan to settle in Rajasthan. He is threatened by rival gangs in Punjab, hence Rajasthan offers a safe heaven. He said he wanted multiple cases registered against him so that cops could not sent him back to Punjab,” said an official.
