LUCKNOW: The failure of   and local police in removing encroachments from BN Road is resulting in frequent traffic jams at   crossing, one of the busiest roundabouts in city which connects important markets like Lalbagh, Nazirabad and Aminabad.
 
 It becomes extremely difficult to drive on BN Road during peak hours as shopkeepers have encroached entire footpaths and further extend their display upto the middle of the road. Several shops of steel goods, plastic chairs, electronics, tyres, furniture along BN Road put up their wares on display outside their establishments up to the middle of the road, causing traffic jams and inconvenience to commuters.
 The customers coming to these shops also park their vehicles at the spot, further obstructing traffic movement. The BN Road connecting Lalbagh to Kaiserbagh witnesses heavy traffic throughout the day and traffic jams have become a usual feature on the stretch due to encroachments. Locals claim that LMC officials do not take action despite repeated complaints being registered with municipal corporation.
 
 LMC officials, however, said that they conduct anti-encroachment drives from time to time but the shopkeepers tend to encroach again.
