MANGALURU:  ,24, a resident of Tumakuru, who is now cooling his heels behind bars for serial church and temple thefts, took to a life of crime to lead a luxurious life. In a span of two years, as many as two dozen cases were registered against him, including a dozen in Dakshina Kannada district.

 Naveen, who has cleared the PU exam, worked in the garment industry for nearly seven years. In between his work, he used to steal motorbikes in the vicinity, in order to finance his extravagant lifestyle. His luck ran out after he was caught after stealing his eighth motorbike. He learnt more about various modes of theft when he met Umesh, a murder accused, in jail. According to police, Umesh was a notorious criminal and Naveen was trained under him to commit more thefts. He taught him more new techniques of committing thefts, which included thefts from homes, temples and churches.
 
 Police sources said with the help of Umesh, who now works in Ujire, Naveen involved himself in a series of thefts. Cases against him are registered at Uppinanagady, Dharmasthala, Kadaba, Belthangady and Venur. “His run in Dakshina Kannada was ended when he was nabbed in Uppinangady, recently, where he had looted several churches and temples. He is currently lodged in Dakshina Kannada district jail,” added a police source.
