 Addressing graduates of   (GTU) at its convocation ceremony in  , Kohli said, “In the present scenario, we see a feeling of discontentment among youths because of unemployment. Such a feeling is natural when you do not get a job despite getting higher education. Such discontent among youths is a warning bell for any society,” he said.
 
 Kohli spoke at the convocation in the presence of CM   and education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma. He said it was necessary to choose a degree while looking at jobs in the market. 
 
 “That is why, we all need to first think whether youths will get employment opportunities after they get degrees in higher education from universities. If we fail to guarantee employment after giving them degrees, doubts will be raised about the relevance of our higher education system,” Kohli said. He said it is time the country moves in the direction of being a ‘developed’ country from a ‘developing’ one. Kohli stressed that development of some cities does not mean that the entire country is witnessing development.
 
 Later,  , when asked about Kohli’s remarks, said the government would consider the governor’s suggestions. “Whatever the governor had said was his personal opinion and suggestion. Our government will consider the positive aspects of his suggestions.”
