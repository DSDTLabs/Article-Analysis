PATNA: Bihar assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary on Sunday released ‘My Life Struggle’, the English translation of peasant leader and revolutionary Swami Sahajanand Saraswati’s memoir ‘Mera Jivan Sangharsh’. Swami Sahajanand Saraswati had written the memoir in 1940 when he was in Hazaribagh jail during freedom struggle. It was published in 1952.

 The English translation of the book was done by Walter Hauser, Professor Emeritus of South Asian history at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, and Kailash Chandra Jha, who has served as acquisitions specialist in the US Library of Congress office as well as was a political advisor in the American Embassy based in New Delhi. Both the translators have been working on understanding the life of Swami Sahajanand Saraswati for the past four decades.
 
 The academic edition of the translation was published in 2016, while the present popular edition was released on Sunday for wider circulation. The book was published under the aegis of Chinta Haran Singh Social Development Trust. Trustee of the trust, Satyajit Singh said the world knows Swami Sahajanand Saraswati as the leader of peasants.
 
 “Swami ji was the one who started the peasant movement in Bihar, an important step towards social justice in the country. The movement was tantamount to spearheading a revolution against oppressive zamindars (landlords) in the state. He was not only a peasant leader, but a social reformer, historian, philosopher, writer, ascetic and a revolutionary as well,” Singh said, adding Swami Sahajanand’s ashram at Bihta will soon be renovated. 
 
 The translator of the book, Kailash Chandra Jha, said the Kisan Sabha movement started in Bihar under the leadership of Swami Sahajanand Saraswati, who formed the Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha in 1929.
