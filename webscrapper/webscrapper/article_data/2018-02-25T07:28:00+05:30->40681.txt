Ludhiana: With the Election Commission directing factories and commercial establishments to observe holiday for their workers so that they could cast their votes, a large number of businessmen voted with their friends and families and enjoyed it as a day off the work. 

 Bhupinder Singh Basant, a prominent businessman and socialite who voted with his family, said, “Whether it’s a holiday or not I along with my family always cast our votes in every election, be it for the legislative assembly, parliament or for MC. Every eligible voter should cast his or her vote as even a single vote can make a huge difference in the democratic process,” he said. 
 
 Chairman of Knitwear Club, Vinod Thapar, who voted in the first half of the day said, “As a businessman and chairman of a leading association it’s my responsibility to lead by example and that is why I cast my vote and even encouraged my friends to vote, so that we can send deserving people to the MC house and materialize the dream of turning Ludhiana into a smart city at the earliest.” 
 
 Harish Kairpal, finance secretary of Knitwear Club, who remains away to Dubai most of the times due to his business there said, “Tis time I had planned my schedule in such a way that I do get to chance to cast my vote. And despite rains today I along with my wife and my sons went to cast our votes.
