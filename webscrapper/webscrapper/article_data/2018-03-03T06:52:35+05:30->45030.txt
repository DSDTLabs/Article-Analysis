CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Friday directed the police to file an FIR against   mutt pontiff   Saraswathi, if prima facie case is made out based on a complaint alleging disrespect to Tamilthaivazhlthu (Tamil anthem). 

 Justice M S   passed the order on a plea moved by advocate S   of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam.
 
 According to Doraisamy, on January 23, a function was organised at Music Academy, Chennai, presided by   governor Banwarilal Purohit. 
 
 "When the Tamilthaivazhlthu was played while commencing the event, the pontiff, instead of rising from the seat - with an intention to insult the anthem and to bring hatred and to excite disaffection towards the government - remained seated till the song was completed. Thereafter he behaved normally. Therefore, he had committed offences of contempt and disaffection towards the anthem punishable under Section 124 A (sedition) of the IPC," Doraisamy said.
 
 Pointing out a 1970 government order, the advocate said all functions of the state should mandatorily commence with Tamilthaivazhlthu and end with the national anthem. Since there was no response on the complaint filed by him seeking action against Vijendra with Esplanade police on January 25, the petitioner had approached the high court. tnn
