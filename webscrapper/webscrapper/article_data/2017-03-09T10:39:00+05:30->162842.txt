LUCKNOW: The high-stake electoral battle in UP touched a new benchmark on Wednesday when the   percentage reached the highest ever of over 60%. The previous high was in 2012 when 59.48% voting was recorded in the state. The seventh and the last phase covering 40 assembly seats in seven districts of eastern UP saw 60.03 % voting -- much higher than 57.92% and 55.36% recorded in 2012 assembly and 2014 Lok Sabha   respectively.

 As per the Election Commission officials, the final tabulated polling   of the first six phases is 61.18%. Chief electoral officer T Venkatesh said with over 60% voting in the seventh phase, the overall polling percentage the state has already crossed 60% and may even touch 61% -- the highest ever in UPâ€™s electoral history. 
 
 The high voting percentage came amid a keenly fought triangular contest between the SP-Congress alliance, BJP and the BSP. While SP-Congress smarted under almost no sign of anti-incumbency, the BJP made a high pitch election campaign led by none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi. BSP chief Mayawati, too, has been pitching her party strongly in one of the most crucial elections that could determine her political fate. It saw Varanasi recording an impressive 61% turnout -- up from 58.3 in 2012. 
 
 Another significant aspect of month-long voting is higher turnout of female voters. They contributed towards the high polling percentage. According to ECI records, till the sixth phase, 63.26% female voters exercised their franchise against 59.65% male voters. This was almost also 3% higher than in 2012 when 60.31% women cast their votes. 
 
 Chandauli district recorded the highest poll percentage of 61.13% in the seventh phase. The Chakia reserved seat in Chandauli, in fact, recorded 61.72% voting, which was likely to go up further, the poll panel said. It was followed by the tribal dominated districts of Sonebhadra and Mirzapur where voting percentage touched a figure of 61% and 60.80%, respectively. 
 
 Even in Ghazipur, where a raging poll battle ensued between Gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari's brother Sibgatullah Ansari and BJP's Alka Rai, wife of slain BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai, the poll percentage went close to 60%. Jaunpur and Bhadohi registered a voting percentage of 58.73% and 58.30%, respectively.
 
 Out of all seven phases, highest voting percentage of nearly 65.5% in this assembly election was recorded in the second phase in which 11 west UP districts covering 67 assembly constituencies went to polls. The first phase -- covering 73 assembly constituencies in 15 districts inwest UP -- too saw a voting percentage of around 64.5%. Thereafter, the turnout dipped with the sixth phase posting lowest 57%.
 
 "Over all the assembly elections turned out to be free and fair and peaceful,'' said Venkatesh. He said that the commission was analysing the figures for further perusal and references.
