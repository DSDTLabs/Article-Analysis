Scoring   for a   is never an easy task, but that’s what makes it such a good challenge, says Sridhar V Sambhram, who has composed for   and is known for his work in Mussanje Maathu, Krishnan Love Story, Krishnan Marriage Story and Krishna Leela, among others. “As a composer, it is a challenge, especially when you have to score the background music. There are some high points, which take the film to a different level. Since I have a keen interest in melodies and rhythms, I had to work on creating a score that underlines the narrative in a beautiful manner,” says Sridhar. The film, directed by Musanje Mahesh, has Meghana Raj, Samyukta Hornad, Nakshatra Babu and Prathama Prasad Rao in the lead along with Ragini Dwivedi playing the role of a cop. “There are different aspects to the music with each character,” says Sridhar.

 The film also sees Anup Dayanand Sadhu, Group GM, Container Corporation of India Ltd., make his debut as a playback singer. “For the patho song Gali Beesi Gali Beesi, I was looking for a very different and new voice, which people hadn’t heard before. When I came across Anup’s videos, I knew that his voice would suit the song and that he was perfect for it. He has a very different voice and a certain tonal reference that I was looking for,” says Sridhar, adding, “Working with him was a great experience. He sang like a professional and it didn’t feel like it was his first time as a playback singer.”
 
 Singing for the first time can be nerve-wracking for many, but as Anup puts it, ‘it was mind-boggling’. “It is a very challenging role and the whole experience was brilliant. The song Gali Beesi Gali Beesi is a very intense and touching number. I have tried my best to put out emotions according to the  ,” says Anup adding, “Sridhar was very supportive and is a down-to-earth person. He was always open to suggestions and there couldn’t have been a better music director than him for my debut.”
