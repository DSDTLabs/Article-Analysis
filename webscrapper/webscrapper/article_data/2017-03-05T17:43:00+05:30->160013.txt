Three-year-old Adwait Gomkale leaves for school at 9am. Before that, he spends two hours with his father watering vegetables and making compost. Familiar with spinach, fenugreek, potato, cabbage and other vegetables, Adwait enjoys the satisfaction of having grown something from the start.

 Going beyond terrace farming and kitchen gardening, residents of Jagruti Colony (near Friends Colony) have turned into urban agriculturists. What was once a one-acre unused land has today set a stage for community farming. Owned by former corporator Sadhna Barde and her husband Naresh, the land is now open for residents to practice urban farming. 
 
 Conceptualized to endorse a ‘self-sufficient’ model for farmers, ‘Amrit ki Kheti’ — as the residents call it — is completely organic and has successfully incorporated land, water and waste management. “We started in November last year. Since earth movers would have cost a lot and we didn’t want to disturb the land’s topography, we made small platforms from a slurry of cow dung, cow urine and dry leaves and started sowing seeds in it,” says resident Rupinder Nanda. Earlier, the litter of dry leaves would be burned, causing massive air pollution in the area. 
 
 As the crops grew, so did the number of partakers. “We started with five-six people but today more than 30 residents are a part of this,” says Yogesh Aneja, who sowed the initial seeds of ‘Amrit ki Kheti’.
 
 A large variety of crops including cabbage, red cabbage, potato, spinach, Amaranthus, sweet potato and others are being cultivated — all without using any pesticides or insecticides. Dependent purely on human labour with hardly any use of electricity or fuels, the model shows the way for agricultural reform that “can solve crisis faced by farmers”.
 
 Water is drawn from a nearby well using a treadle pump. “It’s a human powered suction pump, pedalling on it is an excellent exercise,” says a resident Tulika Upadhyaya.
 
 From kids to senior citizens, all come down here every morning to get their hands ‘dirty’ and reconnect with lost roots. For 78-year-old NG Panchalwar, every morning is like “going back to the old days”.
 
 The locality’s kids are growing a ‘pizza’ using green and red leafy vegetables. “They do read about farming in textbooks but here, children are learning life skills. They don’t make faces now when offered vegetables,” says Adwait’s father Ashish.
 
 Keralites of Jagruti Colony have developed their ‘state’ corner where they are growing banana and tapioca. “We are reliving the days when we would do farming in our villages,” says KR Vasudevan, a retired government servant. 
 
 Apart from organic healthy vegetables and fruits, this farming is bearing other fruits too. “We have been neighbours since years but this is the first time we are spending quality time and getting to know each other,” says 74-year-old N Prasad, who did terrace farming at an elevated area in the land. 
 
 “This is better than the routine exercise we would earlier do. Nurturing crops is a stress-buster,” says KPC Pillai. 
 
 Sundays are a picnic for these urban farmers. “We pick out vegetables and distribute it among families. This is a step towards joining the social movement to promote organic farming,” says Naresh Barde.
