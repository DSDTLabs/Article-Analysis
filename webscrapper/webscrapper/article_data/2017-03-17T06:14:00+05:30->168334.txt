NEW DELHI: Facing arrest warrant for defying   orders in a contempt case against him, Calcutta High Court’s   has passed a suo motu order, despite being divested by the   of judicial powers, directing the CJI and six senior-most SC judges to pay him Rs 14 crore in compensation.

 He also ordered the   to probe and report to   on his complaint of corruption against 20 sitting and retired SC and HC judges. 
 
 The allegations were construed as contempt by  , leading to setting up of the seven-judge bench which initiated contempt proceedings against him.
 
 The SC had issued bailable arrest warrant against him on March 10 while ordering his production before the court on March 31 as   twice defied the SC summons seeking his presence to carry forward the proceedings.
 
 Ignoring the serious consequences, Justice Karnan, ordered to be divested of both judicial and administrative work by the SC, passed an order on Wednesday and followed it with a letter to the seven judges on Thursday. 
 
 In Wednesday’s order, Justice Karnan directed the CBI to conduct a thorough probe into his corruption charges against the 20 judges and said material to substantiate his allegations was available with Madras HC.
 
 More seriously, he ordered the seven judges on the bench headed by the CJI to pay him a compensation of Rs 14 crore for ruining his reputation. 
 
 “The seven judges have prevented me in carrying out my judicial and administrative works from February 8 till now. Therefore, I am calling upon all seven judges to pay compensation, a sum of Rs 14 crore as compensation since you disturbed my mind and my normal life, besides you have insulted me in the general public due to lack of legal knowledge,” he said. He also asked them to pay the compensation within seven days.
 
 Justice Karnan further muddied the waters by firing off a fresh letter addressed to the seven judges informing that their interim orders were null and void.
