Nagpur: The  , city polices’ women grievance redressal unit opened in January this year, had not only extended it’s support to 313 woman and three senior citizens but 54 males too were among the ones who were counselled. On the eve of women’s day, the success story of the unit was narrated by its in-charge PI Subhada Sankhe in presence of city police chief K Venkatesh and DCP Ishu Sindhu at a press meeting at commissionerate on Tuesday.

 PI Sankhe informed that around 370 cases were dealt in the span of last one-and-half month which led to the reunion of several split families. She also informed that 55 couples were reunited despite critical differences setting them apart through sustained counselling. “The cell is getting around 10-20 fresh cases per day,” she said. “Mental torture from husband, extramarital affairs, demands of money, addictions, sexual abuses, suspicion and such other reasons have so far come to fore as major triggers of disparities,” said Sankhe. 
 
 Advocate Rekha Borkute, also a member of District legal services authorities, said that there is a subunit at the cell helping the clients to get professional helps for court matters. 
 
 Several counsellors, like Sangeeta Dhomne, Hemlata Patil and others, shared their experiences of counselling couples who came from varied background ranging from lower economic strata to even highly placed government employees.
