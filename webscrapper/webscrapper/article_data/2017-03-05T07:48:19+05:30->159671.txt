SANGRUR: Suspecting that her husband was cheating on her with another woman, a resident of Sangrur in Punjab murdered him and hid his body in the kitchen refrigerator. It was the discovery of the corpse by the victim's relatives two days later on Saturday that led to the woman's arrest. 

 On the night of March 2, Kuldip Kaur, 32, repeatedly attacked Navneet Singh, 35, her husband of 10 years, with a kitchen knife while he was asleep at their house in Ajit Nagar locality of Sangrur, according to police. 
 
 The next morning, she went about her daily chores as usual. On Saturday, some of Navneet's relatives came to the couple's house and asked for him. However, Kuldip's evasive replies about his whereabouts aroused their suspicion and they began looking for him in the house, and were aghast to find his corpse in the fridge. It came to light that Navneet too had doubted Kuldip's fidelity and the couple's ties had soured over the last few years. 
 
 After the relatives called the police, the entire house was cordoned off for  . Later, the body was shifted to Sangrur civil hospital for autopsy. A murder case has been registered.
 
 In a similar case on February 21, 2017, the body of an   corporal Vipan Shukla, 27, posted at Bhisiana air base, near Bathinda, in Punjab, was discovered in a fridge of his colleague's house.
