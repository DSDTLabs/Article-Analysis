   has suddenly decided to discontinue the   ( ) course for Stds IX and X. The subject has been a mainstay for over a decade. The central board's decision, for which no explanation was provided in the circular, now makes the second option of English Language & Literature (ELL) a mandatory subject by default. 

 The only leeway the board has allowed is that Std X 2018-19 batch can take up EC if they have studied it in the current academic session.
 
 The scrapping has taken everyone by surprise as it has come late in the academic session.   across the country are set to face the problem. The CBSE spokesperson did not respond to TOI's query on the decision. 
 
 A school principal said that the classes for Std IX are set to begin in April, and it will be a challenge to teach the subject.
