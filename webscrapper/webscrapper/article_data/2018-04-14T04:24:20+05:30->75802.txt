MUMBAI: In yet another move to decongest   at Bandra (W), the   on Friday partly demolished 10   as part of the road widening work after issuing them notices. The BMC has decided to follow the   to compensate the affected shop owners by allowing them to construct ground-plus-one-storey structures instead. 

 “According to the Kurar pattern, we will give the affected parties additional area to construct vertically. But this is plausible only when the affected area is more than 50% of the structure,” said Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner of H-West ward. He added that the Kurar pattern is a win-win situation for both the BMC and the affected parties—the civic body saves funds on providing alternative space, while the project-affected persons, especially commercial establishments, do not have to shift base.
 
 Earlier this week, the BMC had razed a dilapidated bungalow on Hill Road which fell in the road line. Bandra corporator Asif Zakeria said, “As one of the arterial roads of Bandra, it is essential to widen Hill Road and decongest it for smooth traffic movement. But surprisingly under the new hawkers’ policy, the BMC has proposed street vendors on this stretch, who will congest the road again.”
