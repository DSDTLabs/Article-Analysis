KANNUR: The   in Kerala, led by the leaders from this district, has become a party led by those who have lost their conscience, said senior   leader  . Addressing a public meeting as part of the conclusion of the second day of the Janamochana Yatra led by   president M M Hassan, here on Sunday, he also said the Congress party would not take rest until the people behind the murder of Youth Congress activist Shuhaib SP are brought to justice.

 “I wish Shuhaib murder is the last political murder in the district,” he said adding that the CPM leadership, which talks tall about the RSS intolerance in the country should first take steps to put an end to the intolerance it shows towards the voices raised against it.
 
 If the CPM in Kerala fails to change its intolerance towards others it would face greater setbacks than what it faced in West Bengal, warned Antony.
 
 He also handed over the fund collected by the district leadership of the Congress to help the family of Shuhaib, to his father. A total of Rs 92,08,437 was collected and Antony said the humanitarian gesture for mobilising this fund was unprecedented in the Congress. He also released a documentary on Shuhaib.
 
 Leader of the Opposition  , who also addressed the function, said the Congress would extend its full support to the agitation by ‘Vayalkilikal’ the residents of Keezhattur here, against the proposed NH bypass through their paddy fields. Though the Congress is not against development, the government should consider the sentiments of people who would lose their land, he said.
 
 Ramesh Chennithala, who earlier visited dalit female auto rickshaw driver Chithralekha, in the backdrop of the   government’s decision to take back the five cents of land allotted to her by the previous UDF government, said the government action is dalit atrocity and the police should register case against the official who issued this order.
