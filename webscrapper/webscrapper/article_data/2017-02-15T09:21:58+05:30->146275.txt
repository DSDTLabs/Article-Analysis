LUCKNOW: Coming a long way from shaming youth on the day for promoting ‘foreign’ fashions, students, fans of the   and activists of the   made most of the  , instead of the usual rose buds, professing love for Prime Minister Narendra   fo bringing about a digital revolution and initiating the the Swachh Bharat mission. 

 About 15 students gathered at Tagore Library lawn and exchanged lotuses before moving on the campus to gift the flower to teachers and other students. Teachers accepted the flower with a smile without airing any political views. Other students, however, said the group was camapiging for the BJP and trying to earn youth support for the elections to be held in Lucknow on Sunday. The group, on the other hand, insisted they had chosen lotus because it is the national flower.
 
 Leading the brigade of Modi fans was a girl student. “My friends are busy celebrating the day with their beloveds and best friends but I decided to express my love for the man who made an efforts to change the country by taking bold decisions of demonetization and digital India,” said Ishdeep Kaur, MA student. 
 
 Another PM supporter, a BA student Jasveer Shukla said, “Everyone was busy hunting for roses to celebrate the day but we went across the city to find lotus to express our love for PM.” He added that like the change brought about by the PM, we should change our thinking that celebration of love is not confined to a boundary or that it is a foreign influence. 
 
 “BJP supporters are often blamed for being against Valentine’s Day celebration but we have taken this initiative to bring about a change,” said Law student Vishwa Pratap Singh. “If a particular student is a fan of some political leader and sees him as an icon we cannot stop him from exercising the freedom expression. There was no complaint of any indiscipline or campaigning on the campus. It was students’ will and the university did not have any objection,” said chief proctor Vinod Singh.
