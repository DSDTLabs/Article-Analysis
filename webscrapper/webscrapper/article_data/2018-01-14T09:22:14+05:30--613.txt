CHENNAI: In an effort to provide a comfortable environment for the increasing number of patrons for metro trains,   has installed sensors at underground stations to monitor indoor air quality. 

 Every station, a metro rail official said, will have sensors that will continuously monitor carbon dioxide levels while ventilation and air conditioning systems filter out particulate matter. "The sensors are installed to ensure comfort of commuters though each may wait at an underground station for a maximum of only 10 minutes," he said. "If the levels go up, the sensor will trigger an alarm."
 
 CMRL follows norms prescribed by National Building Code and American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (Ashrae) to monitor air quality. Experts said CO2 levels depend on the number of commuters and frequency of trains.
 
 Officials said air-conditioning systems are installed with filters that throw out dirt, dust, pollen, smoke and other pollutants. The ventilation and air-conditioning system will keep stations cool, ensure air flow through the tunnels, draw out smoke during emergencies and remove heat generated.
 
 In 2016, an   study found high concentration of PM 2.5 on the premises of metro stations in that city, with some places recording levels more than 600 micrograms per cubic metre. The levels of PM 10 also was high. Permissible limits of PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre.
 
 However, S M  , associate professor from   resources engineering division,  , said a good ventilation system can help tackle air pollution at underground stations.
