It said the vulnerability of the (Aadhaar) system has not been tested and co-mingling funds of different banks in the hands of business correspondents was a major operational risk to the banks,” Saraph said.
 
 In the Manch’s petition too, the use of Aadhaar in banking has raised serious concerns about the safety of the money.
