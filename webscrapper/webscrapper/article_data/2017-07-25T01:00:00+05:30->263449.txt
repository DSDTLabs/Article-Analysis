Seems like horror is the flavour of the season in  . Joining the list of movies that tread the horror-comedy path is director Pudugai Maricha’s 'Mask'. The film revolves around four men who capture a spirit in hopes of making it big in their lives.

 Maricha, who has earlier directed   and Naduiravu, says, “Today, the audience is not keen to watch out-and-out masala films. They look for content that is entertaining and amusing, but not too crass and gory. I think that’s why horror comedy works more than just horror as a genre.”
 
 Interestingly, the female lead —   (of Thaarai Thapattai fame) — plays the ghost in the film. “The movie can be divided into two segments, and Shahana’s portion is like a link that connects both. We’ve finished shooting the talkie portion and are heading to   to film a song,” he says, adding, “The highlight of the film will be one-year-old Mounavathi’s performance. She is so young, but gave a one-take shot with the actors with so much conviction.”
