A human skeleton was found inside a covered drainage channel near APMC truck terminus in   on Monday morning The skeleton was spotted by   ( ) sanitation workers while they were carrying out pre-monsoon desilting work at drainage channels in Vashi.

 Senior inspector Rajendra Galande said, “The skeleton has been sent to the NMMC hospital. It was smeared in muck as it was in the drain. The deceased was wearing trousers and shirt. Some bidis were found in the trousers. Prima facie, it seems like a male skeleton, but a DNA examination will be needed to confirm it. Once that is done, the skeleton will be sent to JJ Hospital’s anatomy department for further forensic analysis.”
 
 “The accused may have murdered the person, dumped the body into the drainage and then covered the channel. It does not look like the victim fell into an uncovered drainage channel. We have registered a murder case under sections 302 and 201 of the IPC,” Galande said.
