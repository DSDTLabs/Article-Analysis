NEW DELHI: Clinical   suggest that the havoc done by   on Sunday could have been the fallout of pent-up anger and the resultant depression making a dangerous cocktail in his mind.

 Doctors say that parents should not ignore regular misbehaviour or torture by children as, at times, they can become dangerous minds without counselling and medication. The fact that Rahul wanted to harm not just his family, but even the neighbours or anyone else who sided with them shows how angry he was with society.
 
 Rajat Mitra, a clinical psychologist, said, “People with such mentality show signs of violence much before such incidents occur. This type of an incident is common in western countries as stress and lack of bonding between parents and children are growing. Rahul may have shown signs of aggression over certain issues earlier as well and held a grudge against his   for not supporting him in something that he expected from him. The concoction of all these aspects could have led to the fit of rage.”
 
 Mental health expert Avdesh Sharma said that in such cases stress mostly depends on the relationship with parents. “It boils down to a point where the person cannot decide whether to trust them or not for something they did to him earlier. We call this impulse controlled disorder. In such cases, the general ability to think clearly goes away.”
 
 Psychiatrists recommend counselling as soon as a person starts shows signs of anger or disgust with the slightest of things.
