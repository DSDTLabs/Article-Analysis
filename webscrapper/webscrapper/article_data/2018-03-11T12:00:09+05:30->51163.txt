BHUBANESWAR: Union tribal affairs minister   on Saturday criticised the   government's decision to form special development councils in nine tribal districts, and accused it of playing vote-bank politics. 

 Naveen on Friday announced special development councils for Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar, Sundargarh, Kandhamal, Gajapati, Koraput, Rayagada, Malkangiri and Nabarangpur. The state has 62 indigenous tribes.
 
 The BJP leader alleged that the councils would affect the functioning of the elected representatives of panchayati raj institutions (PRI) in these districts. "The government has created a parallel administration, bypassing the panchayati raj system," he said. He explained that   had done so to strengthen its hold in the tribal areas of the state. "Keeping its weakness in these areas in mind, the state government has formed these councils to woo the tribals. The government does not give any importance to PRI members of the tribal districts," the minister, who is BJP's face in   along with colleague Dharmendra Pradhan, said.
 
 Jual said the tribals did not like chief minister Naveen Patnaik or his government. 
 
 "The creation of the councils shows BJD's fear of defeat in the next election. The government must explain how it plans to fund these councils," he added.
 
 The criticism evoked a sharp reaction from BJD. State ST and SC development minister   said the Union minister should give more funds for tribal uplift instead of politicizing the creation of the councils. "The special development councils have been created for tribal development. They will have representatives of all 62 tribes of the state. The state will allot funds to them," he added.
