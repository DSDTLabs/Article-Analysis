AGRA: In a major relief to as many as 602 UP tourism (UPT) guides, the Supreme Court, on Wednesday,   seeking ban on their entry at the   of India (ASI)   and Varanasi. The plea was filed in 2015 by a group of tour guides appointed by the Union ministry of tourism.
 
  Deepak Dan, president of the UP guide association, said, “After hearing arguments of both sides, the apex court said there was no ground for stopping UPT guides from working at the   in Agra and Varanasi. We have been working in the ASI sites earlier but the central government approved guides had suddenly filed a case against us.”
  
  Around 65 tour guides in Varanasi will now be able to work at Sarnath, a major tourist attraction. Likewise, 55 tour guides in Fatehpur Sikri and 482 guides wanting to work at the Taj Mahal will benefit from the SC’s decision.
  
  The apex court also gave UPT guides approval to challenge ASI’s new policy governing them. A contempt case was filed against the ASI around two years ago by the UPT guides. While hearing the case, the court said that a policy governing them has already been framed and will be ready for implementation in six months. The guides will also have freedom to approach courts and challenge ASI policies in the future if they found them unsuitable.
  
  The Allahabad High Court had, on March 29, admitted a plea by the Agra guides over the new   concerning them. Accepting the case, the HC had asked ASI and other concerned parties to appear before the court on the next date of hearing.
