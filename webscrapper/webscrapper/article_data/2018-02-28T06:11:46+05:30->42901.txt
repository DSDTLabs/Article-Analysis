LUCKNOW: In a first, an all-woman fighting force is being raised by  . The state government is identifying large land parcels in west, east and central UP to set up facilities for training and accommodation for what could be the first three battalions of the provincial armed constabulary (PAC). The   ‘sankalp patra’ released before 2017 assembly elections had promised to raise women   battalions.

 
 “We have been coordinating with the government to identify land parcels in three districts strategically so that the women personnel could be rushed to handle the crisis anywhere in the state. At least 40 acre of land would be required at three locations as barracks and training ground would have to be set up,” Additional DG, PAC,   told TOI.
 
 
 During agitations of large number of women — for example, Anganwadi or   workers’ protest — the PAC deployed to tackle them is forced to remain at the backfoot as it is largely a male-dominated force. Besides, in a bid to improve gender diversity in recruitment drives, too, the government has asked the police department to raise women PAC battalions in UP.
 
 
 While sending out the detailed letter to various district magistrates, the government has asked them to ensure that the land needed to set up PAC battalions be close to main arterial roads and in well-connected localities.
 
 
 Although the names of the battalions is yet to be finalized, the department is evaluating whether these could be named after Avanti Bai, Uda Devi or  , the three leading women freedom fighters from the state.
