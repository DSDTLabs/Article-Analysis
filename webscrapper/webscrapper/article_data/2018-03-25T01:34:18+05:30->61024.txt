GHAZIABAD: Nearly 24 hours after a three-month-old baby girl was found abandoned at a temple in Abhay Khand, Indirapuram, a couple from Dilshad Garden in Delhi identified the child as their daughter who was kidnapped from their home on Friday night. The couple had filed an FIR in the night itself, a copy of which they brought along to   on Saturday.

 The Delhi Police have detained two persons, including a woman, Laxmi, who allegedly kidnapped the child.
 
 The child was later handed over to the couple after verification of documents.
 
 According to sources, the child was found ‘abandoned’ at Chamunda temple in Abhay Khand, Indirapuram on Friday night. The police had handed her over to Childline, an NGO. The Childline admitted her to MMG district hospital as she was found to be suffering from fever.
 
 Arif Khan, incharge, Childline, Ghaziabad, said: “On Saturday, around 6.30pm, a couple from Dilshad Garden along with a Delhi Police constable and the couple’s neighbours came to our office claiming that the girl belongs to them. They also produced an FIR which was registered on Friday night itself.”
 
 According to the FIR, the name of the child is Harshita, while her parents are Shyam Babu and Sita. They are residents of Kalander Colony in Dilshad Garden. In his complaint to the police, Babu stated that the child was sleeping inside the house while his wife was cooking in the kitchen. 
 
 Delhi Police sub-inspector Rakesh Malik, who investigated the case, said: “On the basis of CCTV footage, we arrested Laxmi, a former friend of Babu. She told us that she wanted to teach a lesson to Babu for marrying some other woman and not her. She said her intention was to create a rift between Babu and his wife.”
 
 According to police, the woman abandoned the child at the temple as she got scared that she would be caught.
