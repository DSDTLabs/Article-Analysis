DHAKA:   continued to stay in contention for his maiden Asian Tour title as he added a three-under 68 to his first-round 66 to be placed just one shot off the lead at the midway stage of the Bashundhara   on Thursday.

 The 20-year-old Indian, who shared the overnight lead, was placed second. He is one shot behind overnight co-leader Thailand's Jazz Janewattananond (66-67).
 
 At 10-under, Shubhankar, who was third at the same event last year, was two clear of third placed Thai duo, Rattanon Wannasrichan (70-64) and Panuphol Pittyarat (66-68).
 
 Despite giving away some shots, Shubhankar said he was satisfied that he had reached his first goal. "My target was to shoot 10-under for the first two rounds and I managed to do it. I am looking forward to the next two rounds."
 
 Three other Indians are in Top-10 with Chiragh Kumar (68-70) at Tied-seventh and Khalin Joshi (69-70) and Udayan Mane (71-68), who shares coach Vijay Divecha with  , placed at Tied-ninth.
 
 Also making the cut at the halfway stage were Rashid Khan (73-67) at Tied-18th, Honey Baisoya (70-73) and Sujjan Singh (72-71) are Tied-36th while Jeev Milkha Singh (74-70) and   (70-74) are Tied-50th and M Dharma (74-71) is Tied-64th.
 
 Ten Indians made the weekend rounds but four golfers - Ajeetesh Sandhu, Kapil Kumar, debutant   and C Muniyappa missed the cut.
 
 Shubhankar had mixed feelings about his round. "The round wasn't as smooth as it was yesterday but it was still a good round. I hit the ball decent although I would like it to be better. My ball striking today was not too bad. I made less birdies and two bogeys which I shouldn't have made. It could have been easy pars."
 
 Leader Jazz, 21, who lived as a monk for two weeks back home in Bangkok last December, traded seven birdies against three bogeys to lead on 11-under-par 132 total at the Kurmitola Golf Club. Local hero, Siddikur, two-time winner on Asian tour, shot 66 to move up from Tied-29th to fifth.
