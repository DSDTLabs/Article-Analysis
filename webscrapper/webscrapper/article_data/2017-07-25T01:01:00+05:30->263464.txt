While that particular decision made Pramodda’s future uncertain, others, like the sudden cancellation of supplementary exams, spelt trouble for many students. Then there was the decision to bar hawkers from entering the campus and also students after 8 pm. So, when  , a final-year degree student, decided to go on a six-day hunger strike in   against these decisions, she had the students’ support. “From this year, it has been decided that the VC will decide if a student can take the special supplementary exam or not. Taking that exam is our right; why should we appeal to the VC for his decision? The authorities are coming up with rules without informing students and this can’t go on,” she told us, adding that the hawkers, like  , are a part of the students’ lives. “How can the authorities take such a decision?” she asked. And it seems her strike has made its point, as the varsity authorities have decided to review some of their decisions.
