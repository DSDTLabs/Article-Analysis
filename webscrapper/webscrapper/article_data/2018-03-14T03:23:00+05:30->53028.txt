Panaji: The Greater Panaji Planning and Development Authority (GPPDA) on Tuesday held its first meeting under the chairmanship of Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate and decided to prepare a land use map for Taleigao.

 The agenda was solely restricted to Taleigao as other villages had opposed their inclusion into the PDA. Monserrate told TOI that only the Taleigao outline development plan ( ) was discussed as town and country planning minister Vijay Sardesai had decided to review the authority.
 
 He said the last plan expired in 2016 and the one prepared by the North Goa Planning and Development Authority chairman Michael Lobo, was not sent to the government for its approval. “We discussed the Taleigao market issue and decided to appoint a lawyer to represent us in court over vacating the stay,” he said.
 
 Sardesai on Monday had expressed his willingness to review the GPPDA jurisdiction at the TCP board meeting to be held on Monday, and, if required, remove certain villages from its ambit. He, however, said he would not compromise on promoting vertical development of the Kadamba Plateau.
