MUMBAI: The Bombay high court   the   application of a youth accused of whisking away a 14-year-old girl to Surat, locking her up in his house there and sexually assaulting her. 

 Justice Sadhana Jadhav said Ranukumar Kori did not deserve to be enlarged on bail. Kori’s lawyers had claimed that he and the girl were in love with each other and the complaint had been lodged by the parents as they belonged to different castes. He claimed that the sexual relations were consensual. The court said the consent of a   girl was inconsequential and would not help the accused.
 
 “Taking into consideration the fact that the victim was hardly 14 years old at the time of incident, and that she did not understand the consequence of  , the consent, if any, cannot be taken into consideration at this stage,” said Justice Jadhav. The court also held that it found it hard to believe that the victim was in love with the accused. “Upon considering the statement of the victim, it cannot be said that the accused and the victim were in love with each other as he had not only subjected her to sexual abuse but had also kept her in confinement. The bail application being sans merit, stands rejected,” added the judge.
 
 The victim’s father had lodged a complaint at Manpada police station that his daughter was missing. On April 5, 2015, the victim telephoned her father and told him that she was in Surat. The father, along with police, went there and rescued her. In her statement, she said she was acquainted with Kori. On March 30, 2015, he had called her to Kalyan station for a chat and then took her to Surat. He sexually assaulted her and used to lock the house when he used to go outside. A neighbour also told police Kori locked the house when he used to go to work.
