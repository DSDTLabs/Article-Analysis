COIMBATORE: Motorists passing through the busy   have to brace for uneven surface, potholes, overflowing drains and leaking pipes, which make their journey miserable.

 The 5km stretch connecting Hopes to   was turned into a one-way when the underground drainage work began in December last year. Six months have passed and the work is not yet complete.
 
 “Every day, at least 10 two-wheeler riders suffer a fall on the stretch. We are fed up of complaining about the pathetic condition of the road to the officials concerned,” said Rajammal, a fruit seller in the area.
 
 Though UGD work has been completed from Hopes signal to the   hospital, the entire stretch is uneven, with manholes set up at a height of 2-3feet from the road surface, said  , an auto rickshaw driver. “Huge pipelines have been placed in front of bus stops, blocking access. Similarly, many shops have their entrance blocked by cables and construction material,” he told TOI.
 
 Vigneswar P, who works in a bakery, said that he was fed up of informing officials about leaking pipes flooding the entrance of the shop.
 
 Meanwhile, Parvathy, executive engineer in-charge of the area, said the road will even out naturally. “Since we had to dig deep to lay the underground drainage pipelines, there could be depression in some areas. We are waiting for them to be even out and a short time is required for that,” she said.
 
 When asked why the road was not even patched up, the engineer said they wanted to complete work on the stretch from ESI hospital to the Singanallur Bus Stand. “Once we are done with that stretch, the highways department will lay the road,” she added.
