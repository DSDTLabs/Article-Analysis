BHUBANESWAR: Water resources minister   on Thursday urged the state government to settle the   water-sharing dispute with   through dialogue. Responding to a series of questions by BJD MPs during Question Hour in the  ,   said he had written to chief minister   on Wednesday seeking a meeting to discuss the dispute. 

 On the state's demand for a tribunal to resolve the row, the Union minister said the Centre was not opposed to the setting up of a tribunal but this would 'delay' a solution. He added that previous water disputes which had taken the tribunal route had taken 20 to 30 years to be resolved.
 
 "The Centre is bound by law to set up a tribunal to settle inter-state water disputes, but it would be better if the state government comes forward for dialogue at my (ministerial) level. If it is not satisfied, it can meet the Prime Minister. After that, it is free to move the   and seek a tribunal," Gadkari said.
