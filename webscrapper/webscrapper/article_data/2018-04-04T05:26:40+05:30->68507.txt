MUMBAI: Monorail services will take at least a month to resume on the entire 20km stretch as the   may have to stockpile an adequate inventory of rake spare parts.

 The inspection of the system was completed by the former commissioner of   safety, SK Garg, on March 28. He has not submitted his report but Garg had told TOI that the he was satisfied with the system soon after completing the inspection. A senior MMRDA official said, “His concern stems from the fact that the rake should not be out of service due to lack of spare parts.” The MMRDA has a total of 10 rakes in its possession right now and is in the process of procuring five more. However, of these only six can be pressed into operation.
 
 
  
 
 Asenior official said, “We need to have adequate stock of tyres as well as other material to carry out daily maintenance and replacement for wear and tear. We may requi-re a couple of weeks to build up the stock.”
 
 Once the safety report is received, it will have to be studied thoroughly and then sent to the state government for approval.
 
 The official said, “It will take up to a month to get the commercial services started.” Mono rail services were operational on the 8.8 km stretch between Chembur and   depot since February 2014. However, services on this stretch too were discontinued after a rake was gutted a fire on November 9, 2017. MMRDA will appoint a new operator for the monorail system as its contract with L&T and   has expired. MMRDA has received two bids, one each from Reliance Infrastructure and Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services(IL&FS). However, the bids will be officially opened on Wednesday.
 
 MMRDA had received a poor response for its operations and maintenance bids. It also had to relax the conditions to attract more bidders as only IL&FS had evinced interest.
