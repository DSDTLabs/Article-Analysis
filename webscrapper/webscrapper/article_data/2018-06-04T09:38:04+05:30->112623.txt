Imphal: Pointing out, what he felt, is a "glaring error" in the laboratory test results of weightlifting champion Khumukcham   Chanu, Manipur chief minister   has urged Union sports minister Rajyavardhan Singh   to intervene into getting her provisional suspension order promptly reviewed. In a letter dated June 2,   has written to Rathore, "I am given to understand that there is a glaring error in the laboratory sample identification based on which the   athlete has been suspended. Records placed before me show that the IWF suspension communication mentions sample No. 1599000 on the top of the report while the fourth para of the report cites sample No. 1599176." 

 "It could also be a suspected case of mix-up of samples of the Manipuri athlete with some other athlete, due to which two different sample numbers are quoted in the suspension order," added the letter.
