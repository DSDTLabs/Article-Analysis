KOLKATA:   seized fake currency notes of denomination of Rs 2000 amounting to Rs 56 lakh from Khidderpore area in south Kolkata on Thursday. The police got an information as some people had gone to   to buy some mobile phones and had paid in fake notes, which created suspicion. Soon the mobile seller had a confrontation with those trying to pass off fake notes and police were informed.

 The   which was in the vicinity managed to nab five of the gang, which was involved in circulating fake notes. Soon after interrogating the five the police seized Rs 56 lakh.
 
 As there were   on the notes so the police are probing if there re any bank insiders involved in the circulation of fake notes. How the new notes have been forged, is a cause of concern for the home ministry too, as Narendra Modi while going for cancellation of notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 denominations had said that it was a step to stop circulation of counterfeit notes. But if within a few months of new notes being circulated fake notes are now in circulation, then the entire purpose of demonetisation will be be defeated, officials felt.
