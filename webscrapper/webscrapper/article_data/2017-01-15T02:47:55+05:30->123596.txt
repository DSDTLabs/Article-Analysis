AMRITSAR:  , a traditional Akali stronghold and the constituency of five-time Punjab chief minister  , could witness the mother of all battles this election season. Punjab Congress chief and former chief minister Captain   announced on Saturday his intention to take on the senior Badal on his turf.

 Badal, who was elected to the Punjab assembly from Lambi in 1997, 2002, 2007 and 2012, filed his nomination papers from the constituency on Saturday for the fifth time in a row. Congress still has to finalise its nominee for the constituency, while   (AAP) has fielded one of its Delhi MLAs, Jarnail Singh.
 
 In 2012, Badal had won Lambi by a margin of over 24,000 votes. Amarinder told reporters in Amritsar that he would seek the the party high command’s permission to contest against the SAD patron. 
 
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the former CM had contested from and won the Amritsar seat by defeating senior   member  .
 
 Amarinder said he was prepared to challenge Badal senior in Lambi to “decimate the Akali leadership”. “To defeat the Badals, I am ready to take on Parkash Singh Badal on his turf,” he said.
 
 He added that the Akali leadership was responsible for “destroying the youth of Punjab and turning them into drug addicts”.
 
 Alleging that the   took help from “goons” in elections, Amarinder accused the party of “allowing anti-social elements to escape” from the Nabha jail in November 2016. He also said that, if voted to power, his “government would probe all the Akali scams and punish every person found guilty of any criminal deed, especially the drug trade”. 
 
 Targeting AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal, Amarinder said: “Kejriwal was with the income tax (I-T) department in Delhi and ran an NGO financed by the Ford Foundation, which in turn was financed by the CIA.
 
 As a government officer, one can’t own an NGO, or accept foreign funds from an agency which is into spying operations. This is his (Kejriwal’s) background.”
