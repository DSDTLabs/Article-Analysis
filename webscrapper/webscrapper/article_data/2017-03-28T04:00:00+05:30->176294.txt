Vadodara: Several members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) tendered their resignations from the party on Monday. The members claimed that they were being ignored while taking decisions regarding key appointments in the party.

 The workers who tendered their resignations largely belong to the AAP’s Sayajigunj assembly unit. They claimed that over 300 party members had tendered their resignations as they were peeved at the state of affairs in the party.
 
 Sayajigunj assembly AAP president Mehul Upadhyay said that old workers of the party, who had been loyal were amongst those who tendered their resignations. “The observers from Delhi are not hearing us out while making appointments. Grassroots workers are being ignored and new entrants are being given positions,” he said. Vadodara AAP president Chinnam Gandhi, however, said that Upadhyay had been suspended from the party recently.
 
 The resignation letter addressed to party chief and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal states that new members, who were affluent were being given positions. It alleges that when the issue was raised with the observers, the observers told them that the decision rested with the observers. “This is against the ideology of the party that believes in taking people along,” Upadhyay said.
 
 Gandhi said that Upadhyay who was spearheading the movement against the party had been suspended six months back. “There was suspicion regarding his activities that were detrimental to the image of the party. He does not have a lot of support,” he said.
