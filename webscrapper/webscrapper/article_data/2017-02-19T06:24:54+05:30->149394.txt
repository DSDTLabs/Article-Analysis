PUNE: In an attempt to save a few bucks on the polishing of his   ornaments, a 64-year-old man ended up losing all his jewellery worth Rs 83,000.

 Two conmen allegedly stole the gold ornaments of the   resident on the pretext of brushing them up them on a cheaper rate. The theft took place at the senior man’s Inglenagar house at around 12.15pm on Friday.
 
 The two unidentified men entered his house and struck a deal to polish the gold ornaments for a cost less than what was being charged in the market.
 
 Police said, “The man was asked to remove his gold chain and ring. The suspects put them in a dish of water. They mixed turmeric and another powder with the water and told him to place it on a burner for five minutes.”
 
 According to police, “While placing the dish on the burner they diverted his attention and stole the ornaments. Before the two men left the house, they asked him to remove the ornaments from the dish after some time.”
 
 S S Nikam, sub-inspector of the Warje Malwadi police station said that the   man realized that he had been cheated when he found his ornaments were never in the dish. The estimated value of the stolen ornaments is Rs 83,000.
 
 “The suspects who communicated in Marathi were between the age group of 20 and 25 years. It was found that they fled in the direction of Karvenagar. There are no CCTV cameras around the area,” Nikam said adding that police were working on certain clues to arrest the gang at the earliest.
 
 The elderly man has registered a complaint against the conmen under sections 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.
