MOHALI: Residents of the societies close to   road in   on Sunday held a protest march against   and   administration. The move was triggered by a poultry farm here, which according to the residents was making their lives miserable.

 
 Showing their anger, the residents of Escon Arena, Maya Garden City, Savitri Grees and Nagla village marched till   crossing on National Highway 21.
 
 The residents alleged that the poultry farm was illegal as it violated pollution control norms that state no poultry farm can exist within a 500-metre radius of residential areas.
 
 “The poultry farm is just 10 metres away from Escon Society. It houses a lot of insects and flies, which enter our houses. Not only this, foul smell from the poultry farm too is making our lives hell,” said P K Sharma, a resident of the society.
 
 S K Dhiman, another resident, said, “A delegation of six residents had met the chairman of Punjab Pollution Control Board, K S Pannu, on September 13, 2017 at his office in Patiala. He assured us that an action in this regard would be taken in the next two months. It is almost a year now, and nothing has been done yet.”
 
 “The farm has a poor excretory disposal system. The workers do not even care to dispose birds’ droppings in a proper way. This gives birth to flies, produces foul smell and brings health hazards,” said a resident Suresh Jain.
