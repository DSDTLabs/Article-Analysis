MUMBAI: For the past few months, the congested   has begun electronically monitoring all vehicular movement on ground. This means the   operator now tracks down to the last second the time an aircraft spends on the runway during a landing or a take-off, the time taken on a parking bay, the time it takes to taxi, the ground vehicle that has gone around to inspect the runway and importantly, the punctuality record of airlines. The second an aircraft begins push back for departure or the second it docks into the parking bay after landing, it’s all recorded by a software called Surface Awareness and Guidance at Airport or SAGA, as it’s users acronym it.

 “Though it was installed in July last year, a number of upgrades were carried out to tailor it for the Mumbai airport and the entire system was available only from January onwards,” said a   ( ) spokesperson.
 
 At the Mumbai airport’s control room where inputs from air traffic control, airlines, etc is gathered for allocation of airport resources like parking bays, checkin counters and baggage carousels, SAGA provides real-time feed on location, movement, speed of aircraft and ground vehicles to act as metaphorical eyes of the operator. “SAGA provides us with real-time situational awareness over aircraft and ground vehicles movements,” the spokesperson added. It also includes a replay mode for incident investigation, the official added.
