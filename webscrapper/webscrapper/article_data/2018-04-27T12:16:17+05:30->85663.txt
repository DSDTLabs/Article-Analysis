INDORE: The Indore district and sessions court on Thursday issued showcause notice to   police station for not filing chargesheet before the court in a case of fraud despite magistrate court’s specific direction to do so in a speedy manner. 

 The complaint regarding embezzlement of a firm’s money was made by its director  , who made allegations against other directors of firm Shubham Goliya, Shashank Goliya and   that they had forged his signature and embezzled money from their joint construction firm. 
 
 Chief judicial magistrate   directed Tukoganj police station in charge and investigating officer to submit their reply to application moved by Ankush Jain through advocate  . 
 
 “We have also submitted before court that Tukoganj TI and investigating officer are pressurizing the complainant to withdraw his complaint in lieu of Rs five lakh and ten lakh, which has been recorded by complainant when he went to the police for getting details of chargesheet,” advocate KK Kunhare, petitioner’s counsel said. 
 
 Ankush Jain, director of Opal Dev Con Pvt Ltd has alleged that in August 2016, other directors had embezzled money from their firm by forging his signature and creating fake documents. Jain approached police then, but they did not take any action against the accused. 
 
 Following this, he approached JMFC court where on August 30, 2016 it was ordered to file FIR and submit chargesheet in the matter speedily. An FIR was filed on September 7, which was challenged by accused before the high court. The petition at high court was dismissed on March 13. 
 
 “Despite the dismissal of petition, when the investigation was not done by police and instead they offered money to complainant to withdraw the case, an application for criminal action against police was moved before the court in which reply has been sought by May 8,” advocate Kunhare said
