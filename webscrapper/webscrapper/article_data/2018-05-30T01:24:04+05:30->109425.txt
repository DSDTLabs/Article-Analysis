NEW DELHI: The   on Tuesday ordered a repoll in 122 polling stations across the two parliamentary constituencies of   (UP) and Bhandara-Gondiya ( ), apart from transferring the   collector over the high VVPAT malfunction rate there. 

 
 A repoll has also been ordered in one Nagaland booth. The  , based on recommendations of its observers for the three constituencies, decided to hold fresh polling on Wednesday in 73 polling booths in Kairana and 49 in Bhandara-Gondiya. Repolls in Kairana and Bhandara-Gondiya were necessitated due to disruption of polling as many faulty VVPATs had to be replaced with “reserve” machines. 
 
 A senior commission official said the EC’s observers, who studied the reasons and impact of the malfunction of VVPATs, sought to blame a combination of factors for the fault.
 
 The fact that the VVPATs were new machines, inadequate training of the polling staff and factors like light and heat may have together contributed to the malfunction, they said. 
 
 "The observers took stock of the impact of VVPAT replacements on the polling pattern and accordingly recommended repoll in some polling booths. The EC accepted their recommendation,” said an EC functionary. As many as 413 VVPATs (nearly 21% of machines deployed) had to be replaced in Bhandara-Gondiya, while 335 (19%) VVPATs were replaced in Kairana. 
 
 The EC on Tuesday afternoon also ordered the transfer of the Gondiya collector and brought in his replacement ahead of the repoll, which will be held between 7 am and 6 pm on Wednesday. While the EC chose not to give the reason for shunting out the officer, sources cited “dereliction of duty”. 
 
 The commission suspects failure to ensure proper training of staff may have led to poor handling of the VVPATs. Chief election commissioner O P Rawat told to TOI that VVPAT malfunction and replacement was not unusual during polling. He added the EC has no doubts about holding the 2019 polls fully with VVPATs.
