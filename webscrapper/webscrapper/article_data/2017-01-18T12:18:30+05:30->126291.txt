DEHRADUN: Claiming that the BJP had more faith in   than its partymen, chief minister   said on Tuesday that ‘history remembers warriors and not deserters”.
 
  In a no-holds barred attack, CM Rawat said that former Congress rebels and the BJP have nothing to offer to the people of Uttarakhand.
  
  “History remembers warriors and not deserters. They (Congress turncoats) have deserted a party which gave them name and fame. Just wait for six months after the elections, most of them will be out of the BJP.”
  
  The CM added, “All they can give to  , conspiracy and scams. They have joined hands for a mala fide intention and the bond will not last long.”
  
  Rawat also said that the BJP list of candidates had exposed the party’s claims of poll-preparedness as nearly one-fourth of the names in the candidate list featured former Congress rebels.
  
  “I have been saying throughout that the BJP has no plan for the  . They are only banking on former Congress rebels, who they believe to be trump cards,” he said.
  
  Rawat added, “The entire focus of the BJP for the past few months has been on one state and one man. Barely 10 days ago, the BJP had claimed that it will not promote dynasty politics and Prime Minister   was advising party members on Parivar-vaad. But just to get rid of me, they have ignored their PM’s advice.”
