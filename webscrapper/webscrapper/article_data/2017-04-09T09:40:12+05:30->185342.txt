PATIALA: A member of the   on Saturday alleged that the Christian community did not get any land for graveyards despite a long-pending demand for it and also didn't receive a penny out of the Rs 100 crore funds announced by the previous government. 
 
 "We got numerous chances to meet chief minister   and his deputy CM son   during their 10-year rule. We raised our demands every time we met them. Announcements were made, but all those remained stuck in the official files. Badal claimed to have sanctioned Rs 100 crore fund for the community and even the money for graveyards from his personal funds was announced but we did not receive a single penny. On the eve of Christmas, our community members were protesting on roads and that was shameful on part of the SAD-BJP government that failed to meet our basic requirement," alleged the state minority commission member Albert Dua. He said that there was need for socio-economic development of the economically weaker section of Christian community in the state.
