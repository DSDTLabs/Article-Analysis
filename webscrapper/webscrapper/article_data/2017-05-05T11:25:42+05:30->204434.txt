 The state currently gets Rs14,000 crore per year in lieu of the petroleum cess.If petroleum products are included in GST, then the state would have to give a share from its revenue to the KIIFB.
 
 Isaac said as per the announcement made in budget, the government would soon launch the   chits through   to mobilize funds for KIIFB. In tax revenue, the state has recorded a growth of 8.98% in the financial year 2016-17, compared to the previous year.

For overcoming the crisis due to demonetisation, the beverages corporation has deposited Rs 74.12 crore into the treasury. Similarly, Rs 339.66 crore was deposited by KSFE and Rs 102.80 crore was deposited by the lottery department.
