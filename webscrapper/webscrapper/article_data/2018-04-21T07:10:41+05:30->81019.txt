BENGALURU: The high court on Friday ordered a   to return the   Canadian-born girl to her biological mother. The court also directed police to ensure the handover.

 The order was passed on a   filed by the mother, Manju Malini Sheshachalam, who claimed her sister, S Shalini, and her husband, Vijay Thirugnanam, had illegally kept her kid in their custody.
 
 
 The girl was born on June 4, 2010 in Ontario. Malini and her husband parted ways in February 2012, and a court in Canada granted sole custody of the child to Malini.
 
 CUSTODY BATTLE
 
 In July 2011, Malini visited India and asked her mother, Latha Seshachalam, to take care of her daughter. She executed a deed, granting Latha custody of the girl and returned abroad. Meanwhile, since Latha and the child stayed alone, Shalini and Vijay asked Latha to shift to their house. Latha agreed.
 
 But in July 2012, when Malini returned and wanted her daughter back, the couple refused, saying they had grown attached to the child. Malini, who intended to take the child back to Canada with her, then approached Bellandur police, the police commissioner and the home secretary but to no avail. She eventually filed a case in court.
 
 Justices R B Budihal and K S Mudagal directed police and the home secretary to facilitate restoration of the child with her mother. The court revealed there is nothing illegal in the petitioner (mother) taking the child to Canada as both she and the child are Canadian citizens
