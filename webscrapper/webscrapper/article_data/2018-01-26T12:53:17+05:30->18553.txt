PANAJI: The Tiswadi mamlatdar has ordered the locking of sluice gates managed by five tenants associations in the Dongorim-Neura   to prevent illegal fishing, and the repair of a 100m breach in   bund. 

 The Khazan tenants association (KAC), which has been formed to fight for the revival of agriculture in the area, in one its meetings demanded that the bunds be repaired before the auction to operate the sluice gates is held.
 
 A surprise visit recently by Tiswadi mamlatdar Sapna   and other officials in a boat along the state’s biggest khazan belt indicated the damaged condition of the sluice gates and breached bunds in the   stretch.
 
 “We have written to the five tenants associations to seal the sluice gates so that no illegal fishing takes place,” Bandodkar told TOI on Thursday.
 
 A few memebrs of the tenants association allow illegal fishing in collusion with sluice gate operators though the auction has been kept in abeyance. The Tiswadi mamlatdar recently ordered a halt to the auction recently, conceding to the request of KAC, which had alleged that till the bunds are repaired, no auction should be held to issue fishing rights.
 
 The mamlatdar has also written to the soil conservation section of the agriculture department to initiate measures to repair the Ofla Domzo bundh, which has a huge breach of more than 100 metres. “This is resulting in flooding of a large area in Dongorim-Azossim area,” a KAC member said.
 
 The electricity department has also been requested to disconnect illegal power connection given to tenants associations at the sluice gate.
