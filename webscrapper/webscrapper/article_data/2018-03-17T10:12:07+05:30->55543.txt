BENGALURU:   was at his jovial best on the eve of the ‘biggest match of his life.’ Ribbing his teammates during his interaction with the media, the Bengaluru skipper also didn’t spare his   counterpart,  , at the customary photo session.

 
 “Jeje won’t fit here man, he’s 120kg,” Chhetri joked, standing on the dais, before hugging his fellow India striker in a warm embrace. Amidst all the banter, however, he was well aware of the magnitude of Saturday’s showdown.
 
 “It’s right up there… probably the biggest match of my life,” Chhetri, who has seen Bengaluru through four titles and the prestigious 2016 AFC Cup final, said. “There was lot of talk when we joined  , how we would fare on our debut. To come into a new league, it wasn’t easy and when I look back, I feel very happy. I’ve played in big games before, but unlike those ties, I don’t know what the result will be tomorrow.”
 
 Captaining Bengaluru has hardly been a task, the 33-year-old said, crediting his team’s selfless attitude. “I know it’s a cliché, but at Bengaluru, we play for the team. Honestly, I have to do nothing. Everyone, from the youngsters to the Indians and the foreign players, is working hard and it’s an honour to captain a side where everyone wants to improve.”
 
 Jeje, meanwhile, is a relieved man. Having ended his six-game goal drought with a brace against FC Goa in the semifinal, the 27-year-old is looking to create history again at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium. Three years ago on a rainy night at the ‘Fortress’, Jeje was part of the Mohun Bagan squad that held Ashley Westwood’s Bengaluru to a 1-1 draw and clinch the I-League title after a 13-year wait.
 
 “I still remember that night when we sealed the title in Bengaluru,” Jeje said. “I hope we can repeat it again tomorrow. I have always enjoyed playing here at the Kanteerava. I don’t think we will be under pressure… the pressure will be on Bengaluru to perform in front of their fans.”
