MEERUT: According to figures released by the office of the   director-general of police (DGP), the state women’s helpline number, 1090, received a complaint every two minutes and over 600 calls every day in 2017. According to exhaustive data released by the police department,   Power Line (as it is known in UP) received 2,21,354 complaints out of which 2,12,177 were resolved.
 
  Of the total complaints received, 77% related to harassment on the phone while 19.9% were about harassment in public places. In addition non-working women in the age-group of 20-25 years were the most affected of the lot. Lucknow topped the chart with 33,529 complaints. It was followed by Allahabad with 9,011 complaints. UP CM’s constituency   too had a considerably high number of complaints — 7,129. PM Modi’s constituency, Varanasi, too saw a large number of complaints, at 8,261.
  
  Of the total number of complainants, 42% were students, while 44% were not employed. Teenagers comprised 22% of the complainants. On an average, 606 distress calls are made every day.
  
  On being asked about the phone harassment cases, which comprise 77% of the total complaints, Rahul Srivastava, PRO to DGP said, “This will certainly come down as the procedure adopted to ensure complete safety to the complaining woman will serve as a great deterrent. For instance, even after the issue is resolved and the offender is warned not to disturb the woman, SMSes are sent to the woman’s mobile number for two years at regular intervals to confirm that she is not being harassed. Similarly,   messages are sent on the harasser’s mobile phone also to make him realise that he is still on the radar.”
