PUNE: Taking a step towards menstrual hygiene, the state minister for rural development and women and child welfare   is set to ensure that all   ( ) school girls, who hold an Aadhaar card, are provided a year-round supply of   napkins for Rs 5.

 The rural department has prepared the proposal that intends to provide the sanitary   to students through local self help groups. The move is expected to address issues of affordability, availability and acceptability apart from ensuring menstrual hygiene among the students, minister Munde told TOI.
 
 “The proposal, named Asmita, is ready and I would be putting it up in the next cabinet session. Once it is approved, we will start providing these sanitary napkins to all Aadhaar-linked schoolchildren and continue giving them not only a year-round supply but also assure the supply of these napkins in their school premises till they pass out,” stated Munde.
 
 She added that the sanitary napkins would be given to all girl students holding an Aadhaar card as the supply will be allocated for each child and school authorities would be able to check the authenticity. Munde explained that self help groups have been chosen to facilitate the scheme as they are already doing it on a small basis. According to Munde, such groups would benefit since through the scheme as the actual cost, about Rs25 to Rs27, will be provided by the rural department to supply the standardized sanitary napkins to all ZP schools.
 
 “A recent survey showed that packaged sanitary pads cost upwards of Rs40. With low cost and quality packaging, we will ensure that students start using it. Eventually, even women from the neighbourhood can approach the groups and buy it for Rs25-Rs27,” added the minister on the project.
 
 While the first phase will cover all ZP schools, if the initiative is successful, Munde is keen on replicating it at all private and aided schools as well.
