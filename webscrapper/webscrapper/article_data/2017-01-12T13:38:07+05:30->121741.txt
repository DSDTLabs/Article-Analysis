THRISSUR: The probe team which was initially assigned to probe the suicide of the engineering student   recovered a suspected suicide note of the deceased student from the college premises on Wednesday. 

 "I quit...my life is a waste...I lost my dream...I lost my dream," read the note according to district crime branch DSP  , who was leading theprobe team initially.
 
 The letter was recovered from the open drain near the bathroom. An undated leave letter was also recovered from slab on the bathroom.
 
 "We have made some initial comparisons, and handwriting in both the letters is similar to that of the deceased student. But they have to be handed over to the forensic analysts,'' said Stephen adding his team had questioned some students, teachers, warden and security staff at the college.
 
 He also disclosed that he had handed over the investigation to the new team led by the ASP  .
