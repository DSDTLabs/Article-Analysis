Keri:   state cabinet on Tuesday approved an allocation of Rs 146 crore for construction of the   irrigation canal in Dodamarg, even as the main dam project at the foothills of the Western Ghats is in the doldrums.

 The Maharashtra government had commenced construction work of the main dam on the   nullah, a tributary of the Haltar in Virdi, allegedly without obtaining necessary clearances from the ministry of environment, forests and climate change.
 
 The project which commenced in 2006 in Dodamarg taluka in Sindhudurg, near Goa’s north-eastern border continued till the Goa government recently filed a complaint before the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal.
 
 More than 80% has been completed while the project work was stopped for the last two years. Water resources department minister Vinod Palyekar said that the Mhadei tribunal has stayed the construction of the Virdi project, including gorge filling and dam construction. “It is really surprising to hear of the Maharashtra government sanctioning funds for the canal or dam which is stayed by the tribunal,” he said. 
 
  then central minister of water resources said that the Goa government had given consent to the Virdi dam on April 26, 2006. But, later on officials of the water resources department of Goa made it clear that no consent has been given to the Virdi dam at the new altered alignment at Temb and Talyachya Vhalacho Dongor.
