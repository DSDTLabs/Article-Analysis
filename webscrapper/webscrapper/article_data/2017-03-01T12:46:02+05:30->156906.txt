  According to Bikram Singh, director, Meteorological Centre, "A fresh western disturbance is going to hit the state from Tuesday night, resulting in showers at many places while snowfall will lash hills." High-altitude places at a height of 3,000 metres and above are likely to be lashed by snowfall while the foothills will witness intermittent rains during the next 48 hours starting Wednesday morning. 
 
 The spell of rain and snow will also lead to drop in temperatures, especially maximum temperatures, which have been settling above normal over the past one week. In Dehradun, the maximum temperature had crossed 28 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, almost five notches above normal. "The temperatures will start dropping from Wednesday evening onwards. There will be a drop in both maximum and minimum temperatures in days to come and they will settle around normal at least till the second week of March," said Singh. Gaurav Talwar
