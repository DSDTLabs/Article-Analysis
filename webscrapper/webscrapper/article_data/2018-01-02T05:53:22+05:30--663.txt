NEW DELHI: Three months after a   body of 22-year-old man was found in an isolated area near  , the crime branch has arrested the prime accused in the case. The accused has been identified as Dhiresh Narayan (22) who had a reward of Rs 20,000 on him.

 According to DCP (crime) Joy Tirkey, Narayan suspected the deceased, Javed Ansari (22), had an affair with his wife.
 
 “On January 1, we received information about Narayan coming to Mukarba Chowk. He was arrested while waiting for a bus to go to Punjab,” Tirkey said.
 
 Narayan lived in Siraspur area of outer Delhi with his wife. The incident had taken place on the night of September 10. Narayan told cops that Ansari used to try to meet his wife often in his absence. 
 
 “He tried to speak with Ansari about it after which Ansari promised to stay away from her. However, sensing that nothing had changed, Narayan plotted revenge. He roped in his friends, Suman, Rahul, Gulab Singh and a juvenile for the act,” Tirkey added.
 
 On the night of incident, Narayan managed to lure Ansari to an isolated spot in village Siraspur on pretext of a party. All five accused persons assaulted him after which Narayan cut his head off. Narayan then carried Ansari’s head and threw is in another field some distance away. Few days after the murder, the other accused were arrested but Narayan managed to remain elusive.
