AHMEDABAD: After a probe by temporary Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed by   SP, inspector of Santrampur police station has filed a complaint with Dabhoda police on Tuesday against a serving police sub-inspector (PSI) for getting job on the basis of forged certificate of his status as a scheduled tribe (ST) member.

 Experts in Gandhinagar said that the case might open the Pandora’s Box as a number of candidates — both selected and under training — in government jobs are under scanner for using forged documents to identify themselves as candidates for reserved Scheduled Caste (SC) or Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories. The state minister for tribal development Ganpat Vasava had already announced introduction of bill to curb the misuse of fake caste certificates to get government jobs and other benefits.
 
 According to Dabhoda police, J K Patel, inspector of Santrampur police station in Mahisagar district, has filed a complaint against Paresh Khant, a native of Ukhreli village near Lunawada. Khant is selected as a PSI in Gujarat Police. The complaint was filed with Dabhoda police as the alleged crime had taken place at   (GPA), Karai in 2016.
 
 “The certificate presented by Khant to   identified him as Hindu Bhil. The certificate was procured from office of Tribal Development in Ahmedabad. Records for this said certificate were not found from the office during the probe. Moreover, the land records don’t have the same community identification for his father. On the basis of these discrepancies, the complaint has been filed as Khant would be asked to record his statement,” said an investigator.
