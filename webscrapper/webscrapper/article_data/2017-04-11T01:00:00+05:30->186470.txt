Model-turned-actor Kabir, who played the baddie in Ajith’s Vedalam, is once again slated to play a baddie in an   film — well, sort of, for, this is a movie being made by Ajith’s fanclub, about Ajith. It seems to be a counter move to actor Vijay’s fan club making a film on their hero, titled 3 Rasigargal. So, well, here we have a movie titled   for Ajith. It’s tribute, and the lead role will be essayed by KM Tejas, Ajith’s doppelganger.   will be directing this one, and Gunaseelan will be the cinematographer. “The shooting has begun,” says Kabir, and adds, “I again play the baddie — it’s a tribute movie and will have stuff from Ajith’s career and life.”
