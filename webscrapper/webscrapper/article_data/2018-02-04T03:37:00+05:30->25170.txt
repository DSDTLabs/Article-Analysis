GURUGRAM: A director and a co-founder of a   on   road have been booked on a complaint of   at the workplace by a 26-year-old former executive who went to the police.

 The woman, originally from   and living in a PG accommodation in Gurugram, claimed the duo started harassing her during work, soon after she joined the company in October last year.
 
 She claimed that the director and the co-founder always forced her to stay back after office hours, wear “short dresses” to office, attend late night parties and join their WhatsApp groups. 
 
 But, things “crossed all limits” last month when the two allegedly physically abused her. When she resisted their advances, she claimed she was sacked from the job. She approached police on Friday.
 
 “I was waiting for an auto to go back to my PG around 6.50pm on January 16. Suddenly, the two came and offered to drop me home. First, I refused but when they insisted I sat in their car. The director, who was sitting on the back seat tried to hug me and touch my thigh. He said ‘these things are normal’. I told them to stop the car, else I would shout. So, they dropped me near   and left. On January 17, I went to office and started working. But they called me into a cabin and scolded me and finally sacked me,” she told the police.
 
 She said that she had raised the issue with her colleagues but they allegedly told her that it was normal and asked her to ‘cooperate’.
 
 An FIR has been filed against the two men under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 34 (common intention) of the IPC at Sadar police station. But, police are yet to arrest them.
 
 “We are verifying the facts and action will be taken as per law,” said inspector Vijay Kumar, SHO, Sadar police station.
 
 Despite several attempts, neither the accused nor any spokesperson for the company could be contacted.
