NEW DELHI: In the wake of the Ryan International School murder, South Delhi Municipal Corporation plans to hire   and   for its   to improve safety on the school campus. Over 2.5 lakh students, most from very humble backgrounds, study in 581 South Corporation schools. 

 “We are conscious about the need to further improve safety arrangements in our schools,” said mayor Kamaljeet Sehrawat. The decision comes after TOI highlighted the lack of a safety net in municipal schools.
 
 No South Corporation school has gatekeepers or guards to monitor the entry of visitors. Though schools have been instructed to close their main gates after the school assembly, and to keep them closed till classes give over, not all schools adhere to the guidelines.
 
 “After the Ryan school incident, we have issued an advisory and asked the schools to follow safety guidelines strictly. No visitor should be allowed inside without his or her details being recorded and identity checked,” said Sehrawat.
 
 An official said the process of hiring chowkidars and attendants had started and appointments are expected to be finalised soon. The chowkidars will be made to undergo an orientation programme and follow a code of behaviour.
 
 Together, the three corporations run around 1,650 primary schools attended by around 7.9 lakh girls and boys in Classes I to V. Most of the students are below 10 years and need higher levels of protection.
