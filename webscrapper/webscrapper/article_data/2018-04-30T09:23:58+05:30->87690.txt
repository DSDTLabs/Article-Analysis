MEERUT: Working as a manual labourer,   made sure that his low income does not come in the way his children's studies. On Sunday, his efforts paid off. His daughter   clocked 92% marks in Class X exams and topped Meerut district. She also scraped through the limited means to achieve the feat.
 
  “I was weak in Science and Mathematics, and wanted to take tuition classes for both the subjects. But my family did not have enough money to afford two tuitions. So, I only took Math tuition, that too for four months only and scored 96 in it. I could not go for Science tuition,” said Neha.
  
  According to Neha, her father always ensured that all five of his children did not leave their studies midway.
  
  Sitting on a ‘khaat’ at his humble house in Meerut’s Sanjay Vihar, Neha said, “I generally used to study during the day because studying at night became difficult due to erratic power supply here. There were times when power connections were snapped at night, and I had to study in candle or in torch light.”
  
  Irrespective of the hardships in the family, Neha’s parents, she says, have been very supportive of the education of all their kids.
  
  Neha has four siblings, two brothers and two sisters. While the two brothers are studying in M.Com and B.Com respectively, one of her two sisters is studying MA and the other one is in Class XII.
  
  “I could not study due to some circumstances at home. But I always wanted my kids to study and achieve respect and success in life. This was possible only if they were educated. So, irrespective of the financial crisis at home, I made sure that I could afford their education. And Neha’s result has just made me believe that I made the right decision,” said Santram.
  
  Neha plans to study Science in Class XI and XII and prepare for civil services to become an IAS officer. “My Class X result has only encouraged me further to work harder for my dreams to come true,” said Neha.
