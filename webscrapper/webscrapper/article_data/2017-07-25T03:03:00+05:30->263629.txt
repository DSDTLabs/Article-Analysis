Nagpur: The city police crime branch is now set to form three more anti-crime squads, in addition to their existing five units, to work independently on issues like burglaries, vehicle thefts and robberies (including chain-snatching). The process of finalizing the squads with hand-picked personnel under supervising officers was underway on Monday, with the squads likely to start functioning across the city within a day.

 It was reliably learnt that the squads were formed by DCP, Crime, Sambhaji Kadam and ACP, crime, Somnath Waghchaure under the supervision of Jt CP Shivaji Bodkhe and city police chief K Venkatesh in view of the disturbing increase in offences like burglaries, motor vehicle thefts and robberies including chain snatchings, in the city in the ongoing year. The three squads would be dedicated to working upon the crimes earmarked to them simultaneously with the zonal crime unit and local police station staffers.
 
 Though such squads had existed in the past too, the latest initiative has been formulated in a more systematic manner, and after due research and analysis by officials for long-term benefits. It is learnt that the need to form the squads was felt by the city police top brass, as it wanted a more orchestrated effort to curb crimes on the upswing.
 
 In city, there have been 540 burglaries, 127 robberies, 43 chain-snatchings, and 893 motor vehicle thefts in this year till mid-July. In 2016, there had been 432 burglaries, 84 robberies, 63 chain-snatchings, and 737 vehicle theft cases till June.
 
 Two officers and 10 men have been allocated to the squad that would work upon cases of burglaries. One officer and half-a-dozen personnel have been sanctioned for the squad dealing with robberies, including chain-snatching. Similar manpower was earmarked for the squad to investigate motor vehicle thefts.
 
 A crime branch officer said teams were formed after personal interviews of officers as well as constables by ACP Waghchaure. “The personnel were hand-picked, based on their experience and interest in detecting such crimes,” said a source.
 
 The squads would be expected to visit every crime scene, observe the modus operandi, conduct a probe, and try to detect the case independently. “Substantial data of burglaries, motor vehicle thefts and robberies would be provided to the squad for their reference. The squads would have access to records of crimes, photographs of criminals, and other details for specific probe and focused action,” said an official.
