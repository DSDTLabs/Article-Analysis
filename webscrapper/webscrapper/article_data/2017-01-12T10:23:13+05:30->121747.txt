MUMBAI: The elite men's field of the 2017   has unfortunately lost its fastest runner as Ethiopian  , boasting a personal best time of 2:04:23, has pulled out of the event due to an injury. However, race director   still believes there's every possibility of witnessing a new course record thanks to the cool weather that's taken over the city.

 The current record for the 42km course was set only 12 months ago when Kenya's  , who began the run as a pace setter, surprised everyone, including Jones, when he stormed to victory in 2:08:35, shattering Ugandan Jackson Kiprop's time of 2:09:32 clocked in 2013.
 
 "It was a surprise really. I never expected it. It was almost a minute he improved it by," a smiling Jones told TOI. He added: "You would think that any improvement by a minute, that would last for a while. That said, the conditions do look favourable now." With Abshero out of the hunt now, Kenyan   (PB: 2:05:16) and Ethiopian Seboka Dibaba, who ran the second fastest time ever recorded in Mumbai last year (2:09:20), remain the men most likely capable of breaking Kipketer's record. "Unfortunately the headliner is injured and pulled out. But if somebody's running 2:06 and they're on the up and up, maybe they would be running something like 2:05 in a sort of perfect conditions race. And maybe that will be enough to lower the course record in Mumbai again."
