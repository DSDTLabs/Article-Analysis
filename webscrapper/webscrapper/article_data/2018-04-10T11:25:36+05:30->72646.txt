PUNE: A   lost Rs 2 lakh when he fell for the bait put out by two men who offered him US dollars at a cheap exchange rate. The Bhosari police arrested the fraudsters Rafiq Halim Hussain (27) and Dilawar Shaikh (25) on Sunday after tracing their cellphones and tracking them to Yerawada . 

 They had duped eight more people in the city with two other accomplices. “The kingpin is on the run,” sub-inspector P R Kathore of Bhosari police said.
  
  
 Kathore told TOI that for the past two years the gang has been duping businessmen and others in need of US dollars. “The gang would identify such persons. In this case, the gang learned about the businessman from an autorickshaw driver,” Kathore said.
 
 The 43-year-old complainant travels abroad often for his business. “Hussain and Shaikh contacted him on March 22 and told him they had US dollars valued at Rs 15 lakh. They showed him a few dollars and told him to get it checked. On confirming they were not fake, he contacted the duo to buy the dollars worth Rs 2 lakh,” Kathore said.
 
 They called him to   in Dapodi on April 5 with the cash. “ On his arrival, he found two more persons with them. The suspects showed him the dollars packed in a plastic bag. After taking his money, the suspects gave him the plastic bag and left the spot,” Kathore said. When the complainant checked the bag, he found bundles of papers instead of dollars.
 
 
 
 
 When the investigators checked the cellphone numbers, they found one registered in Jharkhand and another in Uttar Pradesh. “ We traced the location of the duo to Yerawada,” the officer said.
 
 They kept watch over their movements for three days. “After confirming their involvement in the cheating we arrested them,” the officer said. Hussain is from Jharkhand and Shaikh is from Uttar Pradesh. “We have launched a manhunt for the kingpin,” the officer said.
