KOLKATA: The drive to   from the   in the   continued on Thursday night and Friday morning with   clearing out the stretch beside the corporation headquarters on S N Banerjee Road. 

 Though police said they were continuously removing illegal encroachers, the surprise drives have often been short-lived. Most hawkers manage to return to their usual places after a while. A few police officers said some of the hawkers who were evicted on Thursday night had come back by Friday morning. The police, however, again evicted them from their spots.
 
 An officer of New Market police station said the idea was to keep the four sides of the corporation headquarters free of hawkers. DC central Akhilesh Chaturvedi said the drive aims at keeping the roadways motorable for normal traffic and VIP movement. “Since it is a VIP zone, we have been drawing up plans to contain hawkers who are not abiding by the rule. The drive around New Market is part of the larger plan,” he said. 
 
 Threatened by a section of hawkers who have been doing business encroaching either upon the pavement or the carriageways even after repeated drives by the police, around 5,000 traders of the adjacent markets like Sriram Arcade, Firpo’s Market and Treasure Island have formed the Joint Traders Federation to take a stand against them. 
 
 On Friday evening, a few hawkers were still seen to be doing business on the opposite pavement of Hogg Street even after the drive.
