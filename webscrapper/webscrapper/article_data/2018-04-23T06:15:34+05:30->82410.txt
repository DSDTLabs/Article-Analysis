LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party (SP) chief   on Sunday accused the   government of adopting a ‘casteist’ approach in dealing with the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh.

 Akhilesh told TOI in an interview that while on the one hand suspects belonging to only a few castes were targeted in encounters, on the other, the Yogi administration was trying to save   and   rape accused Kuldeep Singh Sengar. The MLA belongs to the Rajput caste.
 
 
 “How was it that in order to save the Unnao rapist (accused), all from the top to thana level were of the same caste?,” he said.
 
 Akhilesh questioned Yogi’s claim of cracking down on criminals in the state and said his government was perpetrating the biggest crime by picking up suspects from their homes and shooting them down. “If you study the records closely, only a few castes are being targeted,” he said.
 
 Akhilesh said people told him that he too could be a target, but he was not bothered. “Chahe jitna atyachar kar le BJP, hum Chambal ke rahne waale hain, darne wale nahi hai (We are not scared of any government crackdown. We hail from Chambal, the land of valour and courage. We will not be cowed down by any intimidation),” he said..
 
 He added that all encounters would be investigated once SP is voted back to power.
 
 When asked why he has started referring to himself as a ‘backward Hindu’,   admitted that he has changed his political strategy. “I am being forced to do so to counter BJP’s casteist, communal and religious agenda. I always believed in development. But the unsavoury language of BJP’s leadership has forced me to retaliate in the same way. How can a chief minister, brandish himself as a Hindu, refusing to celebrate festivals and rituals of other religions? Didn’t they dare to brand us (SP and BSP) as “saap-chhuchunder” (snake and shrew) and used abusive language to target us?”
 
 Akhilesh said the SP-BSP alliance is working on a joint strategy to defeat BJP in UP in 2019.
