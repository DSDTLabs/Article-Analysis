Madurai: The much-awaited   jallikattu will now be held on February 10 and the organisers are pinning hopes on chief minister O Paneerselvam to attend the programme. This was conveyed by the organising committee after meeting the chief minister in Chennai on Monday. 

 The committee had postponed the event from February 1 as they wanted the chief minister to participate in it. However, when it was announced that Panneerselam was coming to the village to inaugurate   on January 22, it was vehemently opposed by a section of the villagers. They wanted the honour to go to the students who spearheaded the cause. But now, the new turn of events prove that it was indeed politics that gained importance in holding the traditional bull-taming sport the ban on which has since been lifted. In fact, the committee had even extended invitation to AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala to attend the jallikattu.
 
 ``We will ensure that all arrangements are in place and also make more space in the gallery for visitors to see the event this year,’’ said A Sundarajan, chairman of the organising committee. Meanwhile, the Palamedu jallikattu will be held on February 9. The committee is to meet Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao and SP Vijayendra S Bidari on Tuesday to inform them of the new dates.
