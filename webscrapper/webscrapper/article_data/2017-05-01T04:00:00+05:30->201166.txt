Amyra Dastur, who was speculated to make her debut in Tollywood with Puri Jagannadh’s Rogue among several other films, has finally signed a Telugu film. She will play the lead in 
Manjula Ghattamaneni’s next film starring  . And the Kung Fu Yoga actress is quiet up-beat about it. “I guess I was suppose to make debut with everyone out here (laughs). I would keep reading reports about me making my debut with so many actors. Well, I’ve been offered four to five Telugu movies in the past but I couldn’t do them for several reasons,” she says adding, “I wanted to work in Tollywood ever since I did the Tamil film Anegan with   in 2015. I was mesmerised by South cinema and the kind of work is done out here. So, I’m really excited about my debut because I feel like I finally found the right director, co-star and most importantly the script which is all I ever wanted.”
 Talking about the film and her character, she reveals, “It’s a romantic comedy and a very fun and young film. I play a 25-year-old who falls in love, but has several doubts about being in love. The character is a lot like how I am in real life — a free spirited girl. Someone who’s like a flower child, loves nature, yoga and cares for herself. I will be seen sporting peppy attires with flower prints. And even my make-up is going to be very milimistic. And the best part is that the role offers me a lot of scope for acting, and is not just about looking pretty. ”
 The actress, who’ll start shooting for her sequence by end of May in Goa, adds, “All the characters in the film are real and natural, like my co-star Sundeep plays a 27-year-old Hyderabadi boy, who is swarmed with work and needs a break from life.”
