After featuring in itsy-bitsy roles on TV shows,   is happy to be playing Kabir on 'Ishq Subhan Allah'. The character, he says, has made him a household name. The actor, who plays a maulvi on the show, admits that being a Muslim, he had undermined the prep required for the part. “Maulvis speak chaste Urdu, and since I too speak the language well, I thought that the role would be a cakewalk. However, I had to work hard to get it right. While I don’t understand the ratings game, I had not expected such a positive feedback to my character,” he says. 
The actor, who moved to Dubai when he was eight years old, relocated to Mumbai four years ago, and attended several auditions before bagging Ishq Subhan Allah. He recollects, “I told my parents about my inclination towards acting only a year after I started trying to gain a foothold in the industry. My mother is quite old-school, but she never dissuaded me from pursuing my passion. Like my dad, who passed away last year, she told me that I can follow my heart, but made it very clear that she won’t be able to support me financially. They actually expected me to give up and return in a year, but I continued to struggle here.” 
 Recalling his days as a struggler,   says, “I had come to Mumbai with Rs 5 lakh, which I had saved while working as an HR manager with an outsourcing company. I spent half of it by enrolling in an acting course in Mumbai. Money ran out within a year and I started cutting corners to survive. While the course made me realise how tough acting was, my biggest learning came from failing at the auditions. I must have given 100 auditions before bagging a miniscule part on a show and 700 before bagging my first major show.” 
 Meanwhile, his off-screen equation with co-actor   has raised quite a few eyebrows. However, Adnan denies anything beyond friendship and says, “I am single. I have a wonderful work relationship with Eisha. She has done more shows than me and is extremely supportive.”
