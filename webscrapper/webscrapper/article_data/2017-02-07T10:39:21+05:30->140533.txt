NAGPUR: Nagpur University VC SP Kane, on Monday, denied any apathy from their side in probing alleged misappropriation of scholarship amount by colleges banned by it. In an affidavit submitted through special counsel Prashant Sathianathan, the VC clarified that a letter from Pune-based social welfare commissioner’s office was never addressed to it.

 This letter, where it was mentioned that there was a misappropriation of about Rs1.87 crore in distribution of scholarships to the banned colleges, was submitted by respondent —   ( ) director Sunil Mishra — contending that petitioners are targeting only his college, when a majority of colleges in state is facing enquiries regarding the scholarship scam.
 
 The counsel said NU received another letter from the social welfare department on which they conducted an enquiry and found that only two colleges were found to be allegedly involved in siphoning of excess scholarship amount.
 
 After NU’s warning, they returned the excess amount to the government. The affidavit mentioned that NU complied with all norms and there was no recovery by NU from the colleges. It stated that NU allowed all students of banned colleges to appear in the exams, only as per court’s orders and there was no violation of any rules.
 
 A division bench comprising justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari and justice   then adjourned the hearing on PIL against   for its failure to probe alleged scholarship scam at CIIMC.
