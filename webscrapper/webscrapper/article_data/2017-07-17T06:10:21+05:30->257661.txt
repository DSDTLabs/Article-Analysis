CHENNAI: Police on Sunday said they had solved the July 13 petrol bomb attack on the Teynampet police station with the apprehension of six men.

 Investigators said they identified the culprits after experts helped them enhance images captured by security cameras installed in the police station.
 
 The men revealed during interrogations that they devised the plan to attack the police station since cops repeatedly came in search of them following crimes committed within the station’s limits. The prime suspect J Mani, 23, has been attending court proceedings in a murder case. Another suspect Vinod was also recently booked under the Goondas Act by the Teynampet police.
 
 An investigation officer said Mani and Vinod masterminded the plot and took the help of four other friends to execute it after vehicular traffic in front of the Teynampet police station had been stopped temporarily on July 13 to facilitate Metrowater work on the stretch.
 
 The suspects came on three motorbikes and hurled three kerosene filled bombs in front of the office of the assistant commissioner of police. As the CCTVs close to the stretch were outdated, police found it difficult to identify the suspects.
 
 “However, we enhanced the CCTV images using advanced technology. This resulted in clearer images which helped us trace the men involved,” said an investigation officer.
 
 Police subsequently apprehended Mani, Vinod, I Manikandan, 20, Ayyappan alias Ashwin, 21, S Arun, 18, hailing from Ezhil Nagar in Kannagi Nagar, and M Karthik, 32, a resident of Royapuram. Inquiries revealed that Karthik provided the vehicles to carry out the attack. The Teynampet police registered a case and arrested the six men. They were remanded in judicial custody after being produced before a magistrate court in the city.
 
 Police said Vinod had been facing similar charges for hurling   at a Tasmac shop on   in T Nagar on August 12, 2015.
