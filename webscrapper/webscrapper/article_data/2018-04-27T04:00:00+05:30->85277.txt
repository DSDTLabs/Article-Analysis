Rajkot: A factory owner, who resides in Dharmajivan Society at Bhaktinagar Circle in Rajkot lost Rs 54 lakh to online fraudsters. Complainant Kamlesh Thummar (47), who has a factory in Aji GIDC on 80-feet Road, has an account in his company’s name in Bank of Baroda.  On March 31, his sim card became defunct. When he went to the telecom service provider, he came to know that his phone was in operating condition and that his sim card was registered in his name at Surat. Suspecting foul play, he approached the cyber cell of Rajkot police where he was told that a bogus sim card had been availed by some fraudster who had produced Thummar’s driving licence by pasting his photograph instead of Thummar’s. “It appears that the accused had stolen Thummar’s driving licence. Thummar bought new sim card which was activated on the night of April 2. Once it got activated he started receiving messages showing withdrawal of Rs 54 lakh through net banking,” said an official from the SOG of Rajkot police.  “Thummar’s money was transferred into different bank accounts of various banks in Kolkata, Madhya Pradesh and Bhawanipur,” the official added.
