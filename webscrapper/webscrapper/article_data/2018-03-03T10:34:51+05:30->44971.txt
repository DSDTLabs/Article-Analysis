Mysuru: Though voters will be allowed to know to whom they have voted for in the upcoming assembly election, authorities have warned of penal action against those making false allegations on the functioning of the election equipment, said deputy commissioner  .

 The Election equipment that has been brought from different parts of the country are being tested of accuracy by the authorities. The   machines will be used only if they pass necessary tests and the rest wouldnâ€™t be used in the election.
 
 
 
  
 
 On the day of the polls too, their accuracy will be tested by conducting a mock poll involving agents from political parties between 6 am and 7 am, when voting commences. This time, along with polling and control units, Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail ( ) device is being used along with a display unit. It will help voters to confirm to whom they have voted as a slip is generated and displayed for 7 seconds before being dropped into a container.
 
 A voter can complain to the presiding officer if the paper vote is not displayed. Upon verification, a test vote will be conducted in the presence of the agents. If their allegations are found true, the polling will be stopped. In case if it is not true, a case will be filed against the person and a maximum punishment for it would be six months in jail, said Randeep, who is also the district election officer. 
 
 Randeep claimed a voter has been penalized on similar charges during the recent Gujarat assembly elections.
