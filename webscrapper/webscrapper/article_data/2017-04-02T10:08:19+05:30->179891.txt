MARGAO: Former Goa chief minister and Benaulim  ,   on Saturday disclosed that he will challenge the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) order of attaching property worth Rs 75 lakh located at Fatrade, Varca.

 Stating that he is ‘innocent’ in the Louis Berger  , Alemao, in the presence of his lawyer,  , disclosed to the media that he did receive a notice from the ED that sought to ‘provisionally’ attach his eight flats located at Fatrade under Section 5(i) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, for a period of five months.
 
 Terming the order arbitrary and contrary to provision that deals with ‘possession of any proceeds of any crime’ for which he has been charged, Alemao said the flats accrued to him on account of the development of his ancestral property by a firm of which he was a director.
 
 For the land offered to the firm, the company gave the flats to Alemao in 2009 and are registered through a transfer deed in the name of his wife, daughter and son. The 7,489-sq m property at Fatrade was developed by the firm,   Pvt Ltd.
 
 “Transactions pertaining to said land were registered at the office of sub-registrar between 2006 and 2007. Hence, attaching these flats or linking them with alleged offence cited by ED is contrary to the law. The attachment issue appears to be of political nature as senior Louis Berger officials have not been interrogated by those investigating this case,” he claimed.
 
 It is the case of the prosecution that in 2010, bribe was paid to Alemao as per the statement of principal civil engineer, Wachasundar.
 
 Interestingly, though Gracias stated that ED is a quasi-judicial agency, Alemao reiterated his support to the ruling Goa BJP coalition claiming that his constituents desired that he support the government to usher in the much-needed development.
