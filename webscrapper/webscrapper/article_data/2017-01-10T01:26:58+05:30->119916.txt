CHENNAI: A 45-year-old commercial tax officer was stabbed by a miscreant inside the commercial taxes office on Greams Road at Nungambakkam on Monday afternoon. The victim, D Thangavelu, commercial tax officer, south zone, and a resident of West Saidapet, had entered the office at 12 pm, when the incident took place. 

 The unidentified man who approached the officer was speaking to him for a couple of minutes, after which an argument broke out. The officer was on his way to his office on the first floor. In a fit of rage, the man was seen attacking him using a knife, leaving him injured on the back and neck. The staff at the office, who witnessed the incident, came to his rescue, but the miscreant took to his heels. A few tried to get hold of him but in vain.
 
 Thangavelu was taken to a nearby private hospitalwhere he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). He is kept under observation.
 
 Police said they are yet to establish the identity of the man, as the officer has not regained conscious after the attack. 
 
 "We suspect him to be a person known to the officer, as the duo had been talking for a while before the attack. Only after he recovers we could probe the case further," said an investigating officer.
