PATNA: The   (IMD) has predicted above normal temperatures in   and almost the entire country from March to May.

 A report of the all-India weather forecasting agency released on February 28 says the average maximum temperature is likely to be one degree C more than the normal in Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, west and east UP, west and east Madhya Pradesh, J&K, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, west and east   and Uttarakhand.
 
 The seasonal forecast outlook also talks about 52% probability of the maximum temperatures remaining above normal in the core heat wave zone from March to May. 
 
 Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, UP, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Telangana besides the meteorological subdivisions of Marathwada, Vidarbha, Madhya Maharashtra and coastal Andhra Pradesh are identified as the core heat wave zone.
 
 The temperature is already being recorded above respective normal in Patna. The minimum temperature in Patna on Saturday was 18 degrees C, which was four notches above the respective normal. The maximum temperature, on the other hand, was 33.5 degrees C, also four notches above normal. 
 
 Meteorological experts in the city are also expecting higher temperature conditions. “We are expecting above normal temperature at least till March end,” said India Meteorological Society’s Patna chapter secretary  .
 
 The only silver lining in the IMD’s seasonal forecast outlook is in the form of a positive sign for a normal monsoon this year. It notes moderate La Nina conditions over equatorial Pacific even if it weakens by spring season.
 
 The IMD’s recent El Niño Southern Oscillation and   bulletin has said that La Nina conditions are expected to prevail till June this year. La Nina is often beneficial for the monsoon, especially in the latter half.
