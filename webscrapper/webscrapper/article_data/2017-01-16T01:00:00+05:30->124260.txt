Brothers, Ronit and  , for the first time, will be seen as reel siblings in the Hrithik Roshan-starrer, 'Kaabil'. They play the baddies in the revenge drama. The actors have gone all out to bring out the worst in them for their roles. “When I heard the script, I did not get back to Sanjay (director Sanjay Gupta) and Rakesh (producer  ) sir. I was shocked that they’d imagined me in negative role. I spent a sleepless night thinking it’s a wrong role and how I should turn down their offer. When I spoke to Ronit, he told me it’s one of the best roles I’ve ever been offered. And it’s just a character! I don’t know how people will react when they watch the movie,” says Rohit.

 On his part, Ronit says, “The way cinema and negative characters are perceived in 2017, is different from the past. The audience has evolved. People want to see realistic cinema; actors have to play their parts convincingly. 'Kaabil’s script blew me away. Plus, I had a chance to work with my brother.” We are sure the Roy brothers will leave the audience impressed when the film opens on January 25.
