CHARMINAR:   has slowly turned into a garbage dumping yard with traders seeking immediate   from the rear side of the  

 The unbearable stench of piled up garbage forces traders to have lunch at home. Customers passing through this route curse authorities. Despite several requests made to the concerned authorities, officials pay no heed.
 
 “The dumping yard has turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other deadly diseases,“ said Alok, one of the traders. “No one pays attention to our pleas. We want the civic authori ties to shift the dumping yard somewhere else, as our business is getting hit ,'' he added.
 
 Some locals said that they often take a detour to work to avoid this stretch. Local leaders and GHMC officials were informed several times about the prevailing unhygienic condition in the market. Begum Bazaar is still arguably the biggest commercial market of Hyderabad, where retail and wholesale household commodities are sold in bulk. Thousands of people visit the market everyday to buy various commodities. After Musheerabad, Begum Bazaar houses the second biggest fish market of Hyderabad.
 
 The only hindrance at the market is traffic congestion and lack of sanitation facilities. Hundreds of people get stuck here in traffic for hours together.
 
 The few traffic cops have failed to ease traders' woes.
