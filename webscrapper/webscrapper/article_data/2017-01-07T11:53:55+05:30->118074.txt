KARNAL: A groom and his brother -- who were absconding for the past 52 days -- surrendered before the police in Karnal on Friday, in the case of death of a   at the former’s wedding in Karnal on November 15 last year.   and his brother Vinay Singh were produced before the court on Friday.

 Karnal City station house officer (SHO) Mohan Lal said, “Vikrant and Vinay have surrendered and a revolver and a double barrel .12 bore gun were recovered from them. They were produced before the court and have been sent to judicial custody.”
 
 Five persons -- including self-styled godwoman Sadhvi Deva Thakur and her associates -- were arrested earlier in the case. Deva had surrendered in the court on November 18 last year. About 30 rounds were fired by All India Hindu Mahasabha vice-president Deva Thakur and her six associates during the pre-wedding function. The groom’s maternal aunt Sunita Rani died after being hit by a bullet, and four others, including an 11-year-old-girl, were injured. The godwoman had gone to attend the ring ceremony of Vikrant of Sant Nagar in Karnal. Vikrant is believed to be a follower of Deva Thakur.
 
 Investigations suggested one of her associates was carrying a .12 bore gun which developed some problem. While fixing the fault, the person had kept fingers on the trigger, and the gun went off as he closed the chamber. The pellets hit the groom’s aunt Sunita who died, and injured four others. Police had registered a   not amounting to murder, attempt-to-murder, and under Arms Act against Deva Thakur and her six associates.
