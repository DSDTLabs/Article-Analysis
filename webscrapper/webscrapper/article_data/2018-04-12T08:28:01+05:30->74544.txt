LUDHIANA: Amid the ongoing data privacy controversy, a case of misusing particulars of tax-payers to claim income tax refunds worth several crores has surfaced in Ludhiana. This case was busted on Wednesday by officials of the income tax department here. A survey was also conducted on the kingpin of the gang, a tax practitioner based in  , who — according to highly-placed sources — had used personal particulars of hundreds of people to apply for tax refunds on their behalf without their knowledge, usurping more than Rs 2 crore in IT refunds.

 Sources informed TOI that the tax practitioner was on the radar of the department for the past sometime, and officials were waiting for the right opportunity to nail him with proof, and that is why action was taken after the IT return filing deadline of March 31 was over. It has also come to light that more than 300 such refunds were applied by the tax practitioner, and it is likely that a majority of the cases pertained to his old clients, whose personal particulars he had access to. He applied for refunds giving his postal address to receive the pay order, which he allegedly used himself fraudulently.
 
 A thorough investigation is underway on how long the tax practitioner was involved in the scam, and who are his other accomplices who helped him apply for refunds and gain access to the personal particulars of genuine tax- payers.
 
 Meanwhile, teams of the IT department — led by additional commissioner  , joint commissioner  , and other senior IT officials were still at the premises of the tax practitioner until the filing of the news, and according to sources, several incriminating proofs of tax fraud have been found by the team, which are being analyzed for further action.
 
 Income Tax chief commissioner  , however, refused to say anything about the case.
