MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court ordered status quo on an issue related to the move taken by the   (TRB) to conduct fresh examination by cancelling the written examination already held for recruiting teachers to various disciplines in government polytechnic colleges in the state. 

 The TRB preferred an appeal against the single judge order on February 22 setting aside the TRB proceedings dated February 9, last cancelling the written examination. It came up for hearing before the division bench of justices SS Sundar and A M  . 
 
 Following it, the bench ordered status quo and adjourned the case to June first week for hearing. 
 
 In the case on hand, due to complaint from some quarters over valuation of answer sheets, the TRB cancelled the examination. Against it, M Ilamathi from   district filed a case before the high court. 
 
 When the single judge heard it, TRB said that no irregularities took place in the examination and some irregularities only occurred in evaluating the answer (OMR) sheets. Accordingly, marks of about 200 candidates varied, it said.
