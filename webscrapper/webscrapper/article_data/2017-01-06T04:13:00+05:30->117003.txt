Ahmedabad: The president of the Broiler Farmer Coordination Committee (BFCC) Anu Patel met top officials of the animal husbandry department and urged the government to declare the poultry industry safe to save the industry from a crisis.

 Patel said they had urged the government to salvage the situation, especially the positive tests for H5N1 came from turkey and guineafowl alone. “Not a a single case has been reported in poultry but the scare has adversely impacted the sale of chicken, which plunged by 50% in two days,” said Patel.
 
 Patel said that Gujarat consumes 60 lakh broilers a month. “If the government does not declare poultry and poultry products safe soon, consumption will decline pushing poultry farmers— already reeling from the cash crunch after demonetization—in a crisis,” said Patel.
 
 The majority of poultry sellers confirmed that the news of   has sent sales plunging. “Sales have gone down by 30% in two days,” Naeem Kadiwala, a poultry farmer told TOI.
 
 “I sold 150kg of chicken to restaurants and hotels a day, but this has fallen to 50kg per day after the news of bird flu,” said Akik Farooqui, a chicken trader.
 
 Many consumers, however, said that bird flu does not scare them. “My husband is a doctor and loves chicken. If cooked well, it does not pose any problem,” said Natasha Gabche, a Ukranian national who is married and lives in Juhapura.
