AIZAWL: Lalhriatrenga  , deputy controller of mines at Indian Bureau of Mines, Kolkata, said in a press conference on Friday that he has filed a case with the chief judicial magistrate of Serchhip district against Mizoram chief minister  , accusing him of issuing false affidavits before magistrates while filing his nomination papers. 

 Chhangte alleged that though CM Lal Thanhawla owns a landed property at   in Kolkata, he failed to mention this in the affidavit while filing his nominations on 8th November, 2013. 
 
 "Lal Thanhawla has continued to claim that he had never indulged in corruption but he was among the top ten of the richest chief ministers in the country," Chhangte said. 
 
 Meanwhile, the ruling   (MPCC) leaders made counter allegations against Chhangte claiming that he was motivated by personal grudges against the CM because Lal Thanhawla had defeated Chhangte's elder brother, Senior Advocate C. Lalramzauva, three time in the state polls from the Serchhip constituency.
