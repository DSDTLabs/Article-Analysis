CUTTACK: Ahead of January 19 ODI match to be played between India and England, a team of   on Monday reviewed the preparations at   stadium. 

 M V Sridhar, general manager for cricket operations, expressed satisfaction with the arrangements made by the   (OCA), said an OCA source. "The outfield is beautiful. The seats in the galleries have been numbered and to deal with bottle hurling incident the OCA has banned water bottles and water pouches into the stadium. The preparations are perfect," said Sridhar.
 
 The OCA has decided to install jars containing water at all the galleries in the stadium to ensure drinking water supply to the spectators. More than five jars will be installed in each gallery while at least 30 volunteers will be deployed near the jars to serve water to spectators in disposable glasses.
 
 The OCA had received widespread criticism after angry spectators had hurled plastic water bottles onto the field during October 2015 match between India and South Africa. The match was disrupted for sometime due the bottle hurling incident. Senior cricketers, including  , had recommended for ban on Barabati stadium after the unfortunate incident. However, after a gap of one year, the OCA has got the opportunity to host another international match. And this time the state cricket body has not left no stone unturned to avoid a rerun of the incident.
 
 At least 64 CCTV cameras and six   (PTZ) cameras will be installed to keep a hawk's eye on the stadium, said an OCA official.
 
 Besides, water bottle and water pouches, this time fruits, food packets, binoculars, helmets and mirrors will be not allowed inside the stadium. Cuttack DCP Sanjeev Arora also visited the stadium on Monday to assess how security can be tightened. Police sources said on January 11 a meeting will be convened to discuss the stadium's security in detail.
