 They said the Tamil Nadu government should declare the Cauvery delta as a protected agricultural zone. A white paper should be brought out on the   scheme which is feared to affect the livelihood of the fishing communities and the consensus of the people should be obtained through public hearings.
 
 The activists also said that the state and central governments should order the closure of the Sterlite plant in   immediately. It should be ensured that the mineral sand is no longer stolen. Any Indian or foreign company which is to be started in Tamil Nadu, should get the permission of the people living in the specified region and also from experts.
