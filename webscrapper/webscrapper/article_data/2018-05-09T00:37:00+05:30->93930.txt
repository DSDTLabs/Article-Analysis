Trichy: While observing a hunger fast demanding the constitution of the Cauvery management board, members of Joint Action Council of Tamil Nadu Farmers Association (JACTFA) resolved that they will commit mass suicide protest at the Bay of Bengal in Nagapattinam on May 15 to increase pressure on their demand.

 Hundreds of farmers along with JACTFA members took out a rally carrying empty pots on their heads from Chinthamani near Anna Statue, where the hunger strike was held, to the Cauvery Bridge and broke them on the bridge condemning the Supreme Court, which they alleged conspired with the ruling BJP government to betray Tamil farmers.
 
 The protest commenced in the morning presided by the president of the Joint Action Council K Chellamuthu in the presence of coordinator D Gurusamy where functionaries of various farmer’s association such as president of Cauvery Delta Farmers Association Cauvery S Dhanapalan, its state organiser of the farmers’ wing of Tamil Manila Congress, Puliyur A Nagarajan, Tamizhaga Eri Mattrum Attru Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam president P Viswanathan participated.
 
 While addressing the gathering, Chellmuthu said that despite numerous protests and agitations executed across the state, the Centre was still used delaying tactics in constituting CMB in the backdrop of assembly polls in Karanataka. “Since the people in Tamil Nadu have no option but to die, the council has resolved to stage a protest by committing suicide at the Bay of Bengal in Nagapattinam on May 15,” he said.
 
 S Dhanapalan raised apprehensions on whether the apex court too was involved in a conspiracy with the Centre. He also condemned the state government for not waiving farmer loans by appealing in the high court. Puliyur A Nagarajan demanded the TN government to desilt all water bodies and channels before monsoon sets.
 
 Meanwhile, a section of farmers headed by district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam affiliated to CPI Ayilai Sivasuriyan staged a protest against the Supreme Court’s decision by providing time to the Centre again and again, in front of the BSNL office near head post office in the city.
