Nagpur: Bharatiya Republican Party Bahujan Mahasangh chief   has alleged Pooja Sakat, the 19-year-old eyewitness in Bhima-Koregaon violence, was murdered and her body thrown in a well. He has sent a fact-finding team to the spot in Shikarpur and is expecting a report by Tuesday.

 Talking to TOI here on Monday, Ambedkar said BJP-led government in the state had failed on all fronts but succeeded in spreading a reign of terror and intimidation in the country.
 
 “BJP is spreading violence, unprecedented cruelty seen in rapes and then condoning such incidents only to create a situation compatible for spreading of Vedic ideology that its parent organisation RSS wants to foster,” Ambedkar said.
 
 Ambedkar, who was here for some meetings before leaving for Mumbai, said the BJP would be wiped out in state as well as the Centre in 2019 elections. “An untested BJP was tried as an alternative to Congress in 2014. Now people are seeing through the hollowness of Narendra Modi and his party leaders,” the RPI faction leader asserted. The scheduled caste and Muslim votes would now consolidate to defeat the BJP, he added .
 
 On impeachment motion moved by the Opposition against chief justice of India Deepak Misra, Ambedkar said the grounds were weak. “Had the Congress been serious on it, the party would have first raised the issue in   legislature as judge Loya’s death in suspicious conditions happened in this state. But they were unusually quiet on it for three sessions,” he said.
 
 By fielding CM candidate Siddharamiah in Karnataka elections, he said the Congress had shown its weakness and had thus given up its winning position.
 
 He also slammed the Congress for its unwillingness to have pre-poll alliance with smaller parties in the false belief it was now on revival path.
