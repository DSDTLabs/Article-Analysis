CHENNAI:   feels bad for  . At 69, the music composer-turned-politician, who is the   candidate for RK Nagar byelection, has been sweating it out trying to connect with the constituency’s voters.

 With the city starting to feel the pinch of summer, effects of this routine under the punishing hot sun have begun to show on this candidate. Last week, a frail-looking Amaren campaigned at Thirunavukkarasu Gardens, a congested residential settlement just off the Thiruvottiyur High Road near the Greater Chennai Corporation’s Tondiarpet zonal office.
 
 “I shook his hands. He looked absolutely tired and short of breath,” said 60-year-old Meenakshi, a resident of Thirunavukkarasu Gardens 4th street.
 
 Unlike his opponents, a higher percentage of Amaren's canvassing involves walking. But his status as a political greenhorn is not helping him. “I don't know if he has it in him (to be an MLA),” said Meenakshi. Others like N Padma, a resident of Thirunavukkarasu Gardens 5th Street, said that Amaren cannot shake off his TV personality image.
 
 “Even his campaigning has been like that (of a TV star). It is entertaining to listen to him when he sings,” she said.
 
 But Amaren has another reason for why he follows such a campaign strategy. “I sympathise with the people here. As I go door-to-door and witness the poverty that has gripped people here, I cannot help but wonder why the Dravidian party politicians don’t feel ashamed. I grew up in a backward village but the living condition was not so pathetic,” he said.
 
 There are sections of RK Nagar residents who view Amaren's candidature as BJP’s ploy to needle the VK Sasikala faction of the AIADMK. “He has been liberally mentioning the land grab case,” said  , a resident of  , referring to the land grab dispute between Amaren and Sasikala.
