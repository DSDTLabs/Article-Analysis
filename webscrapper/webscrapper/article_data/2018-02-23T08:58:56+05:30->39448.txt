GUWAHATI: A day after Army chief   said the   ( ) has grown faster than BJP, party chief and Lok Sabha MP   hit out at Rawat for making "political statements". He appealed to President Ram Nath Kovind, as supreme commander of the Indian armed forces, to take note of Rawat's remarks against his party. 

 "The Constitution has given him the responsibility to lead out great Army and not to monitor the rise and fall of any political party. He has stepped outside the limits the Constitution has set for him," Ajmal told TOI. Without attempting to comment on the intention behind Rawat's comments, he added, "He may have been misguided or misinformed." 
 
 The Army chief, while addressing a seminar in New Delhi on Wednesday had said, "There is a party called AIUDF, if you look at... they have grown in a faster time-frame than the BJP has grown over the years. When we talk of Jan Sangh with two Members of Parliament and where they have reached, AIUDF is moving at a faster pace in the state of Assam. Finally, what will be the state of Assam, we will have to take a call." He had also referred to the "population dynamics" of the state, which he said "cannot be changed".
 
 Launched in 2005, AIUDF now has three MPs and 13 MLAs in the Assam assembly.
 
 Ajmal hit back, "AIUDF is not a party of Muslim people. Every election, we field 25-30 Hindu brothers as our candidates. Ours a party well within the perimeter of the Constitution. We are a democratic, secular party and our victories come from genuine voters, enlisted by the Election Commission."
