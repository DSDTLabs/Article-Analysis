KOLKATA: At least 11 persons were injured at   in south Kolkata on Friday night when two groups hurled stones at each other over derogatory remarks passed by some of them during a Basanti Puja immersion procession. Four vehicles were also damaged in the clash. The injured were admitted to CNMC Hospital.

 Police said two neighbourhoods — on one Rifle   and another on   Road — clashed when some drunken members of one group commented on the other. “An altercation broke out at 11.30pm and soon turned violent. Police personnels from   and Karaya rushed to the spot and dispersed the mob,” an officer said. 
 
 On Saturday morning, the locals blocked Bondel road demanding the arrest of the accused persons. “We have decided to set up a permanent police outpost at the spot since the area often witnesses such flare-ups over petty neighbourhood arguments,” said an IPS officer of Lalbazar.
