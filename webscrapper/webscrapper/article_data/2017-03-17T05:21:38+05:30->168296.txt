By July, the   Dock Complex ( ) of   (KoPT) will get a floating jetty that will allow barges to unload cargo from larger ships anchored at  . The barges will not have to enter the port confines through the lockgate as the jetty will be close to the Outer Terminal - I. This will allow faster operations as the lockgate can’t be operated beyond a certain number of times every day depending upon the tides.
 
  “By April, floating cranes will be located Sagar to unload cargo from mother vessels to barges. After lighterage, the mother vessels can enter HDC while the barges will unload their cargo at the floating jetty that will have a capacity of 2.5 million tonnes. The system would have been in place by now had we received environmental clearances from the state in time,” said M T  , chairman, KoPT.
  
  Due to draught constraints, large vessels with capacity loads cannot enter HDC. Such ships unload part of their cargo (lighterage operations) at ports like Paradip and Dhamra before calling on Haldia. Because of this, additional costs are incurred by the shipper and KoPT also loses revenue.
  
  KoPT already carried out transloading of the first ship for Haldia at the   in the last few days. Transloading is similar to lighterage but on a much larger scale. Instead of barges, daughter vessels are used for transloading.
  
  Transloading of steam coal from the M V   started on Monday. The ship was carrying 44,000 tonne of coal. Of this, about 21,000 tonne was transferred to the transloader M V Vighnharta (daughter vessel) before both ships entered HDC. “We have offered customers like Tata and SAIL concessional rates if they get their cargo transloaded at the Sandheads and then move it to HDC. We are trying to match the rates offered by Dhamra and Paradip. They will no longer have to use two ports. The floating jetty will also be able to handle barges of 4,000 tonne,” Babu said.
