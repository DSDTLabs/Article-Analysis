VADODARA: A bag filled with country-made liquor pouches from a bike can actually land in a car after getting flung into air despite a deadly collision between the two vehicles. Sounds bizzare! But this is what the city police want us to believe.

 During investigation into Tuesday midnight’s accident between a bike and car on  , police found a bag containing liquor pounches from the car, which had overturned under the impact of the accident. Instead of booking the car driver under prohibition laws, the Sayajigunj police have filed a complaint against the biker.
 
 The police claimed that the motorbike rider was carrying the liquor. When asked how the liquor bag ended up in the car, Sayajigunj police inspector, Haresh Vora claimed, “The liquor bag must have flung off the bike after the accident and landed in the car.”
 
 The police have registered a case of rash driving against the motorcyclist   and later added sections of prohibition law for possessing liquor in the FIR against him and the pillion rider  . 
 
 While TOI had reached the spot minutes after the accident and found bag full of liquor in the car of Rikki Tiwari, eye-witnesses also said that the bag was already in the car when it met with the accident.
 
 Three persons got injured in the accident. Ramchandra was taken to a private hospital on Race Course Road while the other two were rushed to SSG Hospital.
 
 Atul is a resident of   village near the city and Ramchandra lives at Kalyanpura village in   taluka. Police sources said that Tiwari has a house near Polo Ground.
