MUMBAI: Two citizen candidates fielded by residents’ associations lost to   candidates on Thursday. Pestom Sagar Citizens’ Forum had zeroed in on member,   (39), as a candidate. N K Pratapan, general secretary, said any loss was disappointing. “BJP’s upsurge led to the loss and it confirmed that established political parties have an upper hand,” said Pratapan.
