Pune: The   for a separate municipal corporation for   and fringe villages has resurfaced with the state government expressing its reservations over expanding the limits of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).

 The officials, who convinced chief minister Devendra Fadnavis that PMC would not be able to handle infrastructure and amenities if 34 villages were merged in its limits, are pursuing the proposal for a separate municipal corporation. Hadapsar MLA Yogesh Tilekar is at the forefront in demanding a separate municipal body. 
 
 Pune municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar told TOI, “The separate municipal corporation decision depends on various studies. Per capita income and sustainability of revenue resources are important for the civic body.” A state official said, “A separate civic body is the answer to Pune’s rapidly growing urbanization. The PMC is not in position to generate funds for developing infrastructure in merged villages. The chief minister has said that a decision on the matter will be taken after consultations.” The leaders of the NCP are supporting the idea. Ajit Pawar is all for the new civic body, while his party corporators insisted that the state government should take a call on a new body without any delay.
 
 Former mayor and NCP leader Rajlaxmi Bhosale said the decentralization of power would help Hadapsar and surrounding villages to join the development bandwagon. 
 
 The city Congress leaders earlier supported the demand.
