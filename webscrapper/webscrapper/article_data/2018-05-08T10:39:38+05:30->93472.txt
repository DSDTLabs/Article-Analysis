 Director  , who has a huge leg injury, arrived with her three children.
 
 Though media was not allowed to go inside, all the guests came out and greeted the photographers. Sonam's fans will have to do with sneak peeks and videos shared by her friends and family on social media.
 
 Sonam and Anand are to tie the knot on May 8 at 11 a.m followed with a reception and wedding party in the evening.
