 Thakur said law and order situation of the state was completely out of control during the tenure of the previous Congress government.

 Hamirpur MP Anurag Thakur said the Jaswan-Pragpur assembly constituency was poised to become ideal assembly constituency of the state. He said the previous government politicized the issue of the central university and tossed the issue between Dehra and  .
