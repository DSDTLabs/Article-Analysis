PANAJI: The central government has sanctioned Rs 7 crore for various   projects in the state, fisheries minister Vinod Palyekar told TOI on Friday.

 Palyekar, who was in New Delhi, had met with Union agriculture minister  , following which the funds were granted.
 
 “I had a discussion with Singh. The Centre has sanctioned Rs 7 crore for various projects to be undertaken in Goa. The primary project will be the upgrade of the Margao fish market, which will cost around Rs 2.5 crore,” Palyekar said, adding that fish landing centres would also be built in four different locations in the state.
 
 Fish landing centres are comparatively smaller facilities that receive catch from traditional fishing craft.
 
 The fisheries minister has also requested the Centre to draft a national policy banning fishing with LED lamps and bull trawling. “We have asked the Centre to direct all states involved in fishing activity to strictly enforce the ban on LED fishing and bull trawling. I will also write to the Prime Minister requesting him to draft a legislation in this regard,” he said. 
 
 In May last year, the state fisheries department submitted a formal request to the central government for a ban on LED fishing and bull trawling off the coasts of neighboring states. It has been able to put a complete stop on these practices in the state’s waters. 
 
 Palyekar, who also holds the water resources portfolio, was slated to meet Union minister for water resources Uma Bharati, to discuss the extension of the Mhadei Water Dispute Tribunal’s tenure. The meet, however, was called off due to the death of Union environment minister Anil Dave.
