HYDERABAD: Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee working president Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka on Saturday lashed out at municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao for making derogatory remarks on Congress, saying   has no locus standi to even utter the name of Congress.

 Bhatti Vikramarka said that KTR should exercise caution while speaking his mind. “He should remember that Congress was in the forefront of achieving freedom for India from the British rule. He should also remember that it was the Congress which had granted statehood to Telangana,” Vikramarka said.
 
 He said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has turned the government into a dynasty rule. Apart from KCR, KTR (minister), Harish Rao (minister) and daughter Kavitha (MP), nephew Santosh has been made a   member.
 
 He said   could have become Prime Minister or a Union minister in former PM Manmohan Singh’s cabinet but he did not aspire for power.   had rejected the opportunity of becoming the Prime Minister. “We are a party of supreme sacrifices and KTR is too small to speak of Congress party and its sacrifices,” he said.
