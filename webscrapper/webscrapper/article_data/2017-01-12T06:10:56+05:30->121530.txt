MUMBAI: Five days after a fiveyear-old student of Thakur International School, Kandivli, lost a part of her   in an accident at school, principal   on Wednesday resigned on “moral ground“. The school management, it is learnt, has accepted the resignation.

 Last week, senior KG student   lost a part of her little finger on the left when her left hand got jammed in a door while moving from one classroom to another. Her parents had alleged that a teacher had pushed the door, but school officials did not rush the child to hospital in time due to which a part of the finger could not be saved.
 
 Following the incident, groups of parents protested on the school premises on Saturday .They refused to take admission to the next academic year and also boycotted the sports day rehearsal. The school's trustee then assured parents that precaution would be taken to avoid such incidents and that the school would seek an undertaking at the beginning of the year to rush children to hospital in an emergency .
 
 Parents said that an emergency PTA meeting was convened on Wednesday . “We have been informed that the vice-principal will be in charge until a new principal is appointed and that action will be initiated against the others in reasonable time,“ said a parent.“The school has also decided to hold the sports day on its premises instead of on an external ground due to the incident.“
