The participants took pledge to engage themselves in specific actions to check the deadly disease. “The number of cancer patients is on rise and Indore is not an exception. People are not aware that how negligible problems related to their health, including, unusual coughing, a change in urination, continuous back pain, lumps in breast, indigestion or difficulty in swallowing, unexpected weight loss and severe headache lead to cancer,” Dr Sharma said. Healthy diet, correct lifestyle, proper physical activities can prevent cancer to a great extent, she added. Secretary of Ayush Medical Welfare Foundation and homeopath Dr AK Dwivedi said that early detection of cancer and proper treatment not only reduces the treatment expenses but also increase the chances to cure the patients. “One should immediately seek medical help on suspicion of having cancer related symptoms” said Dr Dwivedi.  Indore Development Authority (IDA) chairman Shankar Lalwani also marked his presence in the walk and raised his voice against increasing cases of cancer. He urged people to stay away from tobacco and liquor consumption since they are among the main reasons behind increasing cancer.
