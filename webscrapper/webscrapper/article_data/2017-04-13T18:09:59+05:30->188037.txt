RAJKOT: In a gruesome crime, 10-month old baby girl was allegedly raped by a 32-year-old man in Kanalus village of Jamnagar district on Tuesday night.

 “The girl was weeping. When the parents checked, they found blood stains on her frock and alleged rape. She was admitted to Jamnagar civil hospital and is fine now,” Rayma said.
 
 A case was registered against Thakur under section 376 of Indian Penal Code for rape, and Sections 4 and 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) for penetrative sexual assault.
