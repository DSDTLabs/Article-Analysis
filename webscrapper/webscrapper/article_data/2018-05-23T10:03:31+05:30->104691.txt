DEHRADUN: With maximum temperatures crossing the 40 degree Celsius mark in Dehradun, the   level in Bindal river has gone done, leading to water scarcity in areas where water from the river is supplied for drinking.
 
  Residents of colonies near  , Karanpur and DL Road even complained to the   on Tuesday. “We have been facing water shortage for almost a week now. It’s just the start of the summer season and there are still months to go. If the government cannot provide water now how will they provide water in June and July?” asked  , a resident of Karanpur.
  
  Officials at the   said that the water in these areas is supplied from Bindal river and as the water level in the river has gone down, they are not being able to meet the demands. “The water from Bindal is collected in a tank and is then supplied to the colonies but because the low water level in the river, there is not much water to be supplied,” said Subodh Kumar, superintendent engineer at Jal Sansthan.
  
  Kumar said that the sansthan is planning to reduce the hours of water supply. “We are planning to reduce water supply hours to stop wastage of water. Some colonies will receive water only in the morning and some will receive only in the evening.” he said.
  
  However, residents said that they are already not getting water even once a day and have to rely on tankers. “It has been that we got water through supply. Though the government sends tanker but that is usually not enough so we at times order private tankers as well,” said a resident Subhash Road.
  
  As reported by TOI earlier, water scarcity is one of the major problems the city faces during summers and the government has already identified 391 mohallas and slums in the city that are prone to water scarcity. Officials at the Jal Sansthan said that more tankers are being procured to manage the water supply in areas prone to water scarcity.
