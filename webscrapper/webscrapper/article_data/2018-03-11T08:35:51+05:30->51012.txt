SECUNDERABAD: Many women commuters, between 18 and 30 years, still fall prey to habitual eve-teasers and molesters on the prowl in less-crowded, isolated places near railway stations.

 Police said that habitual offenders were taking advantage of the loopholes in their vigil mechanism, while the SHE teams formed by the government railway police in   almost two years ago are on war-footing to bring down offences of molestation or rape in both railway platforms and train compartments.
 
 Verbal complaints that cops get from women commuters mostly show the offenders pass lewd comments or resort to pestering and eve-teasing while the victims move around the desolated places leading to railway stations.
 
 In many cases it was found that the victims, mostly college students or young professionals, did not muster courage to approach the police to lodge FIRs. They feared that their image might be maligned. “Many of them also don’t reveal about such incidents to their parents or families, fearing they would be reprimanded,” said a police officer.
 
 So, in reality, the number of cases registered by women at railway police stations is far less than the number of women who face such crimes.
 
 In 2017-18 (till February), around 50 IPC cases were booked. Most pertained to harassment, molestation, rape and assaults on women on railway premises.
 
 According to the police, stations prone to such offences include Lingampalli, Hitech city, Faluknama, Kachiguda, Secunderabad, Nampally, Kazipet and   among others.
 
 While the crimes against women have come down on running trains and platforms, there has been a rise in molestation, eve-teasing and other abuses by those known to the victims.
 
 “We book them on the basis of the nature of offence. Mostly we let them go with a warning if the issue is not rape or anything serious,” said a police officer.
