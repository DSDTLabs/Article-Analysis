AURANGABAD: Citizens feel that delay in suspending mobile   services led to the spread of violence between two communities that started on Friday night in Motikaranja.

 Messages and pictures about the riots started making rounds on the social media on Friday night. And the police department decided to suspend Mobile internet in the city on Saturday afternoon.
 
 “On Friday night, we saw around 500 men throwing stones and petrol bombs at each other. However, by Saturday the number swelled to 1,000-1,500 resorting to violence. This could not have happened without the help of social media,” college student  , while giving a first-hand account of the situation, said.
 
 The tension that began in the night became severe by morning and resulted into two deaths and property damage worth several crores. Activist Rahul Ingle said if the mobile internet was suspended earlier, it could have prevented the clashes from snowballing.
 
 Eventually, the government decided to pull off the mobile data services in the city. Inspector general of police Milind Bharambe said, “Considering the gravity of the issue, we have decided to suspend the mobile internet services for at least 48 hours, starting from Saturday afternoon.”
