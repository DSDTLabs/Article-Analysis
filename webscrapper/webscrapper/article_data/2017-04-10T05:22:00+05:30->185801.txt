Guwahati: The state excise department is all set to start the sale of traditional beverages in   shops. The department is also planning several reforms, including online registration, to curb corruption and increase revenue.

 To sell traditional beverages, one has to obtain licences along with a fee of Rs 10,000. Existing liquor shops as well as new traders can apply for the licence.
 
 A senior official of the department said it would take at least four months to finalize everything. Once the department gets the approval of the cabinet, the process can start, the official added. So far, four applications have been received by the excise department for bottling plants of the traditional beverages from Lakhimpur, Jorhat, Tinsukia and Amingaon. 
 
 There will be at least eight varieties of the drinks prepared by different methodologies according to the norms of different tribes of the state. 
 
 “We will encourage self-help groups and others in marketing and production. It will involve villagers and also enhance the economy. It will also give tourists a new taste of ethnic Assam,” said the official. 
 
 Excise minister Parimal Suklabaidya said they will be soon introducing online registration system to bring transparency to the department. 
 
 Starting from application or renewal of permits to payment of taxes — everything will be done online and will be transparent, he said, adding that once the online system is implemented in the latter part of this month, it will be a hassle-free process for the officials as well as clients.
