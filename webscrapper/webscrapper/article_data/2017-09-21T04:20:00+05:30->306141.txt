Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court on Wednesday asked the superintendent of stamps to explain why stamp duty has not been levied on land allocation to the Adani Port SEZ Ltd in Kutch district since 2005.

 The question came from the bench headed by Chief Justice R S Reddy in response to a PIL filed by one Sanjay Bapat. He has complained that the state government has not bothered to recover an amount to the tune of Rs1,400 crore towards stamp duty from the corporate house.
 
 According to petitionerâ€™s advocate Jaimini Patel, APSEZ had contended that a general resolution of 2004 exempted it from stamp duty, but, he argued that a GR of 2005 had done away with such exemption and the company was liable to pay stamp duty.tnn
