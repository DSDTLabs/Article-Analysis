GHAZIABAD: Four new bridges will be constructed by the   (NHAI) adjacent to the existing one across the Hindon river near Indirapuram on NH-24 as part of its the   project. 

 The NHAI will construct two bridges each on either side of the existing bridge, which will be strengthened and refurbished.
 
 According to NHAI officials, a feasibility study is being conducted to assess the extent of repairs and strengthening work required on the existing bridge which is 21 metres wide. This bridge had been constructed by the state public works department in 1975 following which it passed to the ownership of NHAI.
 
 Officials said two new bridges with a width of six metres and comprising one lane each, will be built abutting the existing bridge after demolishing the footpaths. NHAI project director R P Singh told TOI, “As part of the work, the existing bridge will be strengthened and widened. The footpaths on its sides will be demolished. A final call is, however, likely to be taken on whether the existing bridge can handle stress and volume of traffic on the basis of the assessment report. Foundation work for construction of pillars for the two new bridges immediately abutting the existing bridge is under way at present. Work on raising the pillars on these foundations will start from April 15.” 
 
 Two other bridges with a width of 21 metres each will be constructed on either side of the existing bridge. They will have four lanes each. These new bridges will have bicycle tracks and footpaths too. Once the new bridges are constructed, there will be a total of 14 lanes. Construction work on the second section of the highway — from UP Gate on Delhi-Ghaziabad border to Dasna — has been expedited with Prime Minister Narendra Modi scheduled to inaugurate the first section, which is from   to UP Gate shortly.
