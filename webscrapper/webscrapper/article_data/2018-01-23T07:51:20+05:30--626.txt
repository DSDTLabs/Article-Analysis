CHANDIGARH: The lane behind Sector 7-C market has become a source of consistent nuisance for the nearby shopkeepers and residents as they are forced to cover their noses whenever they pass through it. 

 At the lane, there is a spot that is located right behind a   and connects to an underground sewer line. This   is a cause of worry here as it has a tendency of frequently overflowing after getting choked. As of now, the entire neighbourhood has started  .
 
 "The spot is in a  . The entire place is covered in gravel, garbage and uneven terrain. While the rest of the market is properly covered with tiles," said  , a nearby resident.
 
 It is due to lack of repairs that this spot often overflows with gutter water. Not only this, foul odour and excessive garbage residue has now started overshadowing the corners of the lane.
 
 The edge of the toilet wall, which was observed to be broken from different places has exposes the unrepaired sewer line underneath. The spot also accommodates a small manhole, which has remained open for a very long time and has become a breeding ground of flies and mosquitoes.
 
 "We have been dealing with this problem for a long time. This place smells badly. Moreso, when the sewer line is choked, the water overflows to the surface and creates a mess here. We have issued complaints a lot of times but the officials of the civic department fail to acknowledge the problem," said Ved Parkash.
 
 The shopkeepers here also complained that the issue grows many folds during monsoon and heavy rainfall.
 
 When spoken to an municipal corporation official he said, "We will look into the matter soon and get things done at the earliest".
