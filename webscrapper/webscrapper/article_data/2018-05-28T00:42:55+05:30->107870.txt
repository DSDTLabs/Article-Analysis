NEW DELHI: With   Narendra Modi and highways minister   opening the   (EPE) on Sunday, Delhi finally got a   after over a decade’s wait to get rid of about one-third of heavy vehicles that pass through the city, congesting roads and adding to air pollution. The 135-km expressway has been built at an investment of Rs 11,000 crore.

 According to initial reports, over 5,000 vehicles passed through the first-of-its-kind access-controlled highway in the country within three hours of its opening. “We expect this number to cross 50,000 in the next couple of days. Strict enforcement by Delhi traffic police at borders will push vehicle flow on this road,” said an official. For the first 15 days, no toll will be charged from commuters.
 
 Inaugurating the expressway, the PM said it would reduce travel time, fuel consumption and air pollution in the national capital. “It was a challenge for us to build the expressway in only 500 working days,” Gadkari said. This was one of the projects launched by Modi after becoming PM. Opening of the expressway coincided with Gadkari’s birthday.
 
 However, what remains a challenge for   is to regulate traffic movement and ensure commuters follow rules on this high speed corridor. NHAI has deployed six incident management vehicles and six ambulances on this stretch. Six cranes have also been deployed. 
 
 “We need to learn from this project how delay in taking decision costs our economy. Had the earlier government accelerated it, there would have been major direct and indirect saving. The accumulated loss would be mind boggling, if we add fuel and time wastage and lives lost in accidents,” said  , a former NHAI general manager who had prepared the alignment and project.
