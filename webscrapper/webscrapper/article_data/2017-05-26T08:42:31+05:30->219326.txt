BENGALURU: The countdown to the new state Congress president has begun, with AICC general secretary   on Wednesday saying the name will be out in two to three days.

 “The final decision on who will be the next party chief will be known by May 31. I am not going back on my word,” Venugopal told reporters here after winding up his four-day interaction with party functionaries and leaders of all districts. Earlier this month, Venugopal had set a May-end deadline for a decision on the issue.
 
 According to sources, indications are that the   may prefer to maintain status quo and continue with incumbent G Parameshwara as  . With the BJP going all out to woo dalits, with former CM BS Yeddyurappa’s ‘Food with dalit family’ campaign, replacing Parameshwara could provide the party an opportunity to brand Congress as anti-dalit, said sources. 
 
 Besides, the Congress came to power in 2013 on Ahinda (Kannada acronym for backward classes, dalits and minorities) support and doesn’t want to disturb this for the 2018 polls, considering this section stood by the party in the recently held Gundlupet and Nanjangud bypolls. 
 
 However, with chief minister Siddaramaiah keen on having a person of his choice head the party, the high command is said to be looking at alternatives. 
 
 Venugopal also hinted at the party facing the 2018 hustings under a collective leadership, something, he said, a lot of senior leaders expressed.
