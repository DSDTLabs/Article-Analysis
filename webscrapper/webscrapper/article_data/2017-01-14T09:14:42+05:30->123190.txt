LUCKNOW: He gave up a lucrative job to fight legal battles for those implicated in false cases. To be able to do that, BTech graduate   joined the three-year   (KKC) as his heart was in social work.

 Shivam, who has bagged five gold medals — the highest among boys — will be awarded at LU’s   on Saturday. He is also the winner of most medals among students of LU associated colleges. 
 
 “From computer science to law, the transition was not easy. In my own village, I came across people, unaware of the law, facing problems to present their case even if they were innocent. That was motivation enough for me to study law to understand it better,” Shivam said.
 
 “I worked as a computer engineer for seven months but all the while, I couldn’t help thinking about the injustice I had seen in my village during the election for sarpanch. I left my job and joined KKC. It was under the guidance of my father, who is an advocate at the civil court, that I scored the highest in all the years and all the semesters,” he added. 
 
 Shivam is now pursuing his LLM at BBAU satellite campus in Amethi. “I wanted to pursue LLM at LU but due to a writ filed by a candidate, the academic session could not be held there,” he said. He added that doing LLM from   was his dad’s dream too as, way back in 1984, there were only 20 seats in the law faculty.
