ERODE: Framers of   here on Sunday protested against revenue and public works department ( ) officials after they denied the former permission to take silt from a lake.

 The state government had recently allowed farmers to take silt from reservoirs, lakes, ponds as it would facilitate its initiative to de-silt the water bodies. 
 
 The Nathipalayam farmers had 15 days ago approached the district administration seeking permission to take silt from a pond owned by PWD in the village, but in vain.
 
 The farmers then decided to take the silt without obtaining permission from the revenue and PWD officials. On Sunday, they collected 10 truckloads of silt from the pond, using earthmovers.
 
 When the revenue and PWD officials came to know about this, they reached the spot and stopped the farmers from taking the silt. The officials also threatened to seize earthmovers and trucks, if the farmers attempted to take silt from the pond. Irked, the farmers surrounded the officials and asked them the reason for denying them permission to take the silt from the pond.
 
 The PWD officials said the pond had been functioning as the seepage check dam for lower Bhavani canal. “The water flowing pathway will be affected if the farmers took silt from the pond,” they said.
 
 The farmers asked the officials to provide them a written explanation which they agreed. Following this, the farmers withdrew the protest.
