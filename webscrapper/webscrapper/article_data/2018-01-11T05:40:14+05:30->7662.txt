KOLKATA: Even as pilgrims have started making their way towards the mela grounds of  , the state administration and a group of amateur radio operators have started preparing to ensure that people do not get left behind as they were in the previous years.

 TOI had reported how the annual   turned for an ideal location for many to dump elderly relatives, including parents. Efforts to send them back to their homes started after the 2017 mela when the South 24-Parganas district administration sought help from amateur radio operators.
 
 During the 2017 pilgrimage, nine elders were left behind at Sagar Island by their families. It was due to the efforts of a team headed by IG Ajey   and the   Radio Club (WBRC) that the families of all nine were tracked. “We sought help from cops in other states and ensured these people went back to their families,” Ranade said.
 
 Over the last year, WBRC has succeeded in reuniting seven such persons with their families.
 
 “Language is a major barrier as people come to the Gangasagar Mela from various parts of the country. Now, we have started sending video messages across our network. We inform other amateur radio operators and send them the video clippings,” said  , secretary, WBRC.
 
 One of the women the WBRC helped reunite with her brother, who was from south India. All she could give as a landmark was a Shiv Narayan Mandir. Using her dialect, amateur radio buffs from south narrowed down the search to a locality and went from door to door with her photograph. Finally, they succeeded in tracing her brother, who had shifted house to another village 70 km away.
 
 “This year, we have developed a website — www.myham.in — that will directly record voice messages from people, who have been left behind,” Nag Biswas added.
