HYDERABAD: Strongly reacting to chief minister  's outburst on Bharatiya Janata Party national president  , the   BJP said the chief minister's comment has lowered his political stature and termed it as juvenile and unwarranted. 

 In a statement, BJP spokesperson Krishnasagar Rao said   was clearly and heavily rattled by BJP national president Amit Shah's visit being highly successful. The entire state is discussing it and the people of Telangana have welcomed it, he said.
 
 "KCR's unscrupulous statements on Amit Shah are founded in his lack of tolerance to criticism and questioning. He must learn the ABC of governance in a democracy. He is clearly an undemocratic leader who gets scared of the opposition. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is an elected representative and his party today is in power through a democratic process in this state. He should stop thinking that, he is the 8th Nizam and that Telangana is his fiefdom," the spokesperson said.
 
 He said the party would welcome and accept his challenge to resign as Chief minister if the BJP proves that Amit Shah's statements are facts. "Our state president Laxman would clearly state the factual numbers on Thursday.
