The new year has begun on a positive note for  . BT told you earlier this week that the actor, whose last outing was '  3' (2016), will be seen in ' ' with   and Vicky Kaushal. While the film’s makers are gearing up for it to roll, Junior B is keeping himself busy with his football team at an ongoing league. Later in the year, he will also be seen cheering his kabaddi team at a pan-India annual contest. Buzz is that he may also be seen in ' ' and 'Lefty', apart from the   film.
When we brought up the correlation between the enormous gaps between his films and his growing interest in sports, Abhishek said, “I will be back to the studios this year. It’s been a while, so it’s time to move to the other side of the fence. This year, you will see a lot of work from me.” 
 Abhishek was among the first actors to support kabaddi and set up a professional team for it. Gradually, he also moved to football. When asked if he plans to support any other form of sport, he replied, “I’d love to encourage more sports. I want to promote sports to change the mindset that it doesn’t provide a promising future. I think sports are very good for kids and they should take up something or the other.”
 Abhishek asserted that even his six-year-old daughter   likes sports, pretty much like her grandfather   and him. He said, “Aaradhya likes everything, she just loves playing around. I’d be very happy with whichever sport she decides to pursue. The thing with children is that you have to let them follow whatever their heart tells them to do. Just let them do it and see where it goes.”
