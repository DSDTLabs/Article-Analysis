Panaji: FC Goa’s Moroccan midfielder   stands out on the field, not just because of his ridiculous calmness with the ball at his feet but also what he chooses to do.
 
  Jahouh, 29, is the only   player who doesn’t have a sponsor logo at the back of his shirt. For now, it doesn’t cost him much, but even if he had to give away a lucrative sponsorship deal, the Moroccan midfielder has been left in no doubt that he will not endorse an alcohol brand, whatever the circumstances.
  
  “It’s purely for religious reasons that I don’t wear or endorse any brands of alcohol or any brand associated with it. It’s considered a sin in Islam and for that reason, and as matter of principles, I chose to have my shirt without the logo of one of our sponsors,” Jahouh, a devout Muslim, told TOI on Tuesday.
  
  Jahouh has been one of the standout foreign players in this edition of  . No other player has made more passes (1290) that Jahouh, while his 90 tackles in 16 matches are also the most for any player in the ISL. The defensive
  midfielder has been FC Goa chief coach Sergio Lobera’s go to man whenever there is a crisis and his calm approach, even in the danger zone, has won him many admirers.
  
  “Jahouh is a player who had a yellow (card) before in his career and, having coached him before, I know he’s a player capable of handling the game. He takes it up to a limit but at no point did he deserve a second yellow,” coach Lobera has said of him in the past.
  
  Jahouh trained under Lobera at Moghreb Tetouan in Morocco for a year and did enough to win his trust.
  
  FC Goa will miss the influence of Jahouh for the crucial clash against ATK at Fatorda on Wednesday. The midfielder picked up four yellow cards and is now automatically suspended for the next match.
