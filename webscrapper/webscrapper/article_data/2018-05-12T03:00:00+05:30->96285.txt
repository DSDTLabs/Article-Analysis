Panaji:   brings with it seasonal ve getables like taikilo, terro, goenchi bhajji and kuduke bhajji, which grow in any and every open space available and are sourced by locals, who prepare a variety of delicacies from these. However, in urban areas with open spaces decreasing and the fear of garbage and sewage always present, the availability of these vegetable is limited.

 In a bid to ensure that the state’s city and town folk are not deprived of these monsoon delicacies, Goa Rural Development Agency (RDA) has roped in Goa State Horticulture Corporation to import the vegetables from the cleaner rural areas of Goa to the urban areas, for sale.
 
 The horticulture corporation will get self-help groups from Quepem, Canacona, Pernem and Bicholim areas to pluck these vegetables from the greener and cleaner hinterland areas to sell in urban areas through the corporation’s outlets.
 
 “Last monsoon, four to five groups from Pernem and Bardez sourced the vegetables and sold them at the horticulture corporation outlet at Altinho. It was a sell out. So we have decided to supply these vegetables from rural areas in a bigger way this monsoon. The women have been told how the veggies have to be packaged. There will be a collection point where they will drop the vegetables from where the horticulture corporation will pick them for supply to its urban outlets,” said assistant project officer at RDA Bhaskar Narulkar.
 
 Two self-help groups from each of the selected rural talukas will be engaged for the purpose, he said.
 
 In addition to the leafy vegetables, seasonal roots like maddi will also be sold at horticulture outlets, Narulkar said.
 
 Last year, the vegetables were sold at Rs 15 per quarter kilogram, he added.
