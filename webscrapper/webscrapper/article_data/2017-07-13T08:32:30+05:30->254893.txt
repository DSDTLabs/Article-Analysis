 “What is so objectionable about the content in Bigg Boss that is against Tamil culture“, Haasan asked. On the complaint, Haasan said that it was made by people who had a lot of time on their hands.

 “How many of us would have uttered the words in the national anthem incorrectly? Did we ever consider that as an act of disrepute to the national anthem?“ he said.
 
 When asked if he thought he was a soft target for fringe groups, Hassan said, “I am a very hard target. They are throwing darts at me but it won't work. If these allegations had any rationale to it, I would have apologised.“
