AJMER: BJP and right wings has taken up the digitalisation call of Prime Minister   and have started on a data bank system on booth level. This data bank will also help in digital propaganda campaign before elections. This way, programmes and progress card of both central and state government will be revealed to voters on their mobile phones. At the ward level, teams of these organisations are collecting mobile numbers and information of voters to feed in their data bank.

 Just after the RSS shivir in Ajmer about two weeks ago, BJP local organisation along with the RSS and other right wing members are collecting mobile numbers of their region. “This will help us send message to all of them about all programmes hosted by BJP,” said a member. Sources said that this is the first step towards preparation of next assembly elections in 2019.
 
 As per guidelines issued to local party workers, they should have an online list of all voters in their ward along with the polling booth of those voters. “The main purpose of such exercise is to be able to send out messages to voters and avoid usage of pamphlets and hoardings,” said a senior BJP local leader.
 
 The bank of voters’ mobile numbers will also help circulate the progress made by the government in different fields like upliftment of poor, empowerment of women, future of youths etc. “As soon as this system of spreading digital information starts, first programme will be to make people aware about the merits of demonetisation,” said an internal source.
