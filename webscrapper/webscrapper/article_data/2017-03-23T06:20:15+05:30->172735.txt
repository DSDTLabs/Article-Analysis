VISAKHAPATNAM: Besides the increase in the number of hatcheries, a couple of significant causes have been attributed to the drastic rise in the number of turtle hatchlings and nesting. These include imprint technology adopted by sea turtles to return to their place of birth to lay eggs and shrinking nesting grounds in Odisha, which is prompting the turtles to shift towards north coastal  .

 “We had first started noticing turtle nesting and hatching in 1996. In these 20 years, female turtles which were born in the   area have matured and these juvenile females are coming back to their place of birth to lay eggs as per the imprint technology. May be this year, it was the first egg laying by the female juveniles,” said  , founder-president of  , which is collaborating on Olive Ridley protection with the government.
 
 “Another cause for the increase in the number of nests and hatchlings is the shrinking nesting ground for turtles in Odisha. Due to habitat loss, trawling, defence activities and other business development along the beaches, the turtles are coming towards Andhra and Vizag. In the coming years, the beaches of north coastal Andhra districts can become the biggest habitat and nesting ground for Olive Ridley turtles,” added Nath. 
 
 However, experts point out that it’s important to ensure that there is no habitat loss for these turtles due to erosion or excessive pollution or other activities like levelling or digging up the beaches. If these happen, then the turtles would shift elsewhere.
