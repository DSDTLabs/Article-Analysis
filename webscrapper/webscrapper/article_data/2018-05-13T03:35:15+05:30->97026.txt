MUMBAI: The   authorities, probing the drug overdose of Sheena Bora murder accused   Mukerjea, have submitted a report to ADGP-prisons B K Upadhyay that the former media executive consumed the antidepressant outside the jail. The report says the Benzodiazepine she took on April 6 was not prescribed by jail doctors. 

 Indrani was rushed to   from the jail on the night of April 6 with "sudden unconsciousness'' and doctors diagnosed her with overdose of medicines. In 2015, when she was rushed to hospital in similar circumstances, the jail authorities had denied any drug overdose or poisoning. Jail officials who conducted a preliminary probe into her health status then, claimed that she had collapsed due to "poor appetite, loss of weight and weakness". 
 
 The ADGP said he has received the jail authorities' report on the April incident. "I have received the report and am going through it. It's confidential and cannot be disclosed. It will be submitted to the state government," Upadhyay said. tnn
