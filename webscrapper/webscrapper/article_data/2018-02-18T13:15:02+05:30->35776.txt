 contestant and TV actress   is on a high these days as she has had more than one reason to celebrate. She might have lost the Bigg Boss 11 trophy to Shilpa Shinde but she is has been having a whale of the time catching up her family and making up for lost time with her boyfriend  .

 The actress had recently taken her family on a fun-filled Goa vacation and right after that, she took off with Rocky to Sri Lanka. It was a twin celebration for the queen of the small screen as Valentine's Day falls right after Rocky's birthday.
 
 Just recently, she shared a video snippet on her Instagram account of one of the many memorable days that she had spent in Sri Lanka. She captioned the post as: @rockyj1 u are so funny üòÇ.. A must go place in Sri Lanka @elephant_volunteer_pinnawala #pinnawalaelephantorphanage üêò another memorable day.. ‚ù§Ô∏è

 As seen in the post, Rocky turns down a request that was made by his ladylove in jest. They seemed to have shared a lot of these fun-filled moments during their vacation.
  
  
 In fact, in one of her recent LIVE chats, Hina had said, "Rocky is not leaving me alone even for a second. It was a task for him to handle things outside the Bigg Boss house when I was not there."
 
 The two made their relationship public while Hina was staying in the Bigg Boss 11 house. During Rocky's visit to the house, the two of them had confessed their undying love for each other on Television and the former had also put a promise ring on Hina's finger.
