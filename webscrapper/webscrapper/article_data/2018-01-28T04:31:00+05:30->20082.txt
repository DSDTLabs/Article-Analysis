Nagpur: Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal, who was to arrive in the city on a two-day visit mainly to study some projects being implemented here, cancelled his visit followed by defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman. Sitharaman had to inaugurate the national convention of Bharatiya Stree Shakti, an RSS frontal organization for women, here on Saturday. Two days back, the city unit of AAP got information that Kejriwal’s proposed visit had been postponed. However, local party functionaries were not told why the visit was deferred or the date on which it was re-scheduled. “We were only informed that the visit would happen a week or ten days later,” Devendra Wankhade, a city AAP functionary, said. The Kejriwal’s visit was being seen by the BJP-ruled NMC as a big opportunity to get an endorsement of its good work from the staunch critic of the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  It was supposed to be a state visit along with several of his ministers and officials for getting first-hand information of country’s first commercial project of supplying treated sewage water to a power plant, the first 24X7 drinking water supply scheme, green buses run on ethanol, electric taxis and their charging facilities as well as a Metro rail project which claims several firsts like use of solar power. Country’s first women defence minister’s visit, albeit a short one, was also much awaited as it would provide some substance to a meeting of RSS women’s organization. Over a thousand delegation from all over the country are attending the two-day conference.
