PANAJI: The consumer conciliation committee of the directorate of civil supplies and consumer affairs is receiving a number of complaints from consumers who have been duped after shopping online. 

 Committee member   said that unsuspecting consumers have been receiving refitted and expired electronic products after paying for genuine ones online.
 
 A recent case was that of a consumer from Mapusa who bought a power bank only to find that it wasn’t functioning. “We wrote to the company and got an official letter stating that the product was not sourced from an authorized distributor,” Martins said, adding that perpetrators study the profile of their victim, where those with lower literacy levels are becoming targets. 
 
 Retired district court judge and president of the   Pradip   said it was unfortunate that while downloading apps, people’s profiles are being sold to third parties and used for the purpose of marketing products and services online.
 
 Minister for art and culture Govind Gaude said that awareness about consumers’ rights should be spread at the grassroots level. He was speaking on the occasion of World Consumer Rights Day at a programme organised by the directorate of civil supplies and consumer affairs on Thursday .
 
 The directorate launched a citizen’s charter with all information about the department, including schemes, service, documents required, all details of fair price shops and civil supplies godowns, including vigilance and grievance redressal mechanism and contacts of civil supplies inspectors. Director   said copies of the charter will be made and distributed at the taluka level.
