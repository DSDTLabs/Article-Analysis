 “I know the accused and the motorbike he used,” the survivor’s father told reporters, adding that he could identify the accused and the other boys he was friends with. “But for reasons best known to the police and the CBI, all of them have been shielded,” he said.
 
 The survivor’s father was handed over copies of documents related to the investigation, including reports by investigation officers and medical reports, on Thursday. “I have got the case documents after a long struggle. At no cost, do I want this case to be closed.” he said.
