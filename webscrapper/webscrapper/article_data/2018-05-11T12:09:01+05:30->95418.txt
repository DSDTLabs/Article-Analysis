MADURAI: Noted writer A  , 56, who is accused of murdering his 27-year-old son, was sent to a dayâ€™s police custody on Thursday. The police are likely to take the accused to his farm land in   in Dindigul district where the burnt remains of the body are said to be buried.

 Soundarapandi, popularly known as Souba, was arrested by   police on Wednesday for allegedly murdering his son S Vibin with the help of two of his farm labourers. 
 
 Police sources said that the journalist-turned-writer murdered his son in a cold-blooded manner as he was creating trouble for him. Vibin, a postgraduate, had become an alcoholic and squandered money obtained from his father and mother to consume alcohol with his friends. The parents parted ways 14 years ago and were living separately ever since. Lathapooranam is the principal of Government Arts College, Kovilpatti.
 
 Although Soundarapandi gave money to his only son whenever he demanded, he crossed all limits in spending. As he stopped giving money, he recently sold a car worth lakhs of rupees for a throwaway price. Once he finished spending the money, he started asking for more. He also threatened his father with dire consequences, said the sources.
 
 Soundarapandi planned to murder his son and took the help of S Boomi, 40, and R Ganesan, 42, from Nilakottai. Boomi was the one who clubbed him with a hammer. A poisonous vaccine was also administered to him. After making sure he was dead, they shifted the body to the farm land located 35 kms away from the house at Doak Nagar in Kochadai, said the sources.
 
 The trio was produced before judicial magistrate V on Thursday. While the judge ordered 14-day judicial custody, police requested for three-day police custody to further carry out inquiries.
