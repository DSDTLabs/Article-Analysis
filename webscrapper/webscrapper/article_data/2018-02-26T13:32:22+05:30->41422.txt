LUDHIANA: The firing and gang war incident outside a polling booth for Ward No.75 in   has left everyone in shock, but claims and counter-claims have started flying everywhere, with both Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and   blaming each other for the incident.

 Speaking to TOI, SAD district president   said: “The Punjab police is playing a puppet in the hands of some Congress leaders, who are known for their indulgence in such acts of ‘goondagardi’ and violence. It is beyond doubt that Congress workers were trying to cast bogus votes and capture this booth ever since morning, and they had specially hired goons from outside districts and states, which is evident from the fact that they had firearms with them, which they used for shooting at our workers who were trying to save the booth from being captured.”
 
 Dhillon added: “In spite of filing a case against Congress and its workers involved in the attack, Ludhiana police have registered an FIR against our workers, who were shot at and beaten up. What is even more shameful is that they have even booked our supporters who were not even in BRS Nagar when this incident took place. Since we have lost hope of getting any justice from the local police, we will meet the governor tomorrow and seek justice from him. We are even considering approaching the high court for an impartial enquiry into the incident.
 
 Refuting Dhillon’s claims, Congress district president   said: “These are baseless allegations levelled by SAD against us in an attempt to cover the misdeeds of their workers and supporters, who are used to violence and scare tactics. If they are not involved in the attack, then how did our worker   — who was giving duty at the booth — get seriously injured? It is quite clear the attackers came with SAD leaders and attacked our supporters.”
