Trichy: The manager of a private   in Trichy ended his life after murdering his five-year-old daughter on Thursday afternoon. His wife has alleged that pressure from higher officials of the bank to recover loans from borrowers had led him to the extreme step here on Friday. However, the police have ruled out any such pressure from bank higher-ups as of now.

 M  , 33, from Sankaranpillai road in Trichy was found dead inside his house on Thursday afternoon along with his daughter R Arudhra Sri. The bodies were found hanging from the ceiling of the house. His wife   was the first one to witness the dead bodies. 
 
 Ramasubramanian was the manager at a private bank in Fort area. On Thursday, he left the bank in the noon and picked up his daughter from school. His wife was on duty at a private lab.
 
 On returning from duty, Gomathi found their bodies and attempted suicide by consuming poison. The neighbours found the two hanging and Gomathi lying unconscious on the floor. 
 
 After informing the Fort police, they rushed Gomathi to the hospital where she was given treatment. On recovering treatment, she complained to the police that her husband has been under pressure from higher officials at the regional office of the bank. The woman alleged that in order to achieve target, Ramasubramanian had given loan of Rs 85 lakh to a private agency but poor repayment by the agency left her husband in a tight spot. 
 
 The police took up the investigation and said that there was no pressure from higher officials to recover the loan. “The manager had given loans to an agency last one year to reach the target. As they alleged, there was no pressure from higher officials to recover the loan. No one abetted his suicide as per our investigation,” Fort inspector   told TOI. 
 
 The bodies were given to the family following post-mortem at the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) in Trichy on Friday. The police have registered a case of unnatural death and the murder.
