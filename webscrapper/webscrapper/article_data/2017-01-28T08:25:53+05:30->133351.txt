AHMEDABAD: The travel and   was gravely  , but there are signs of a revival as people have begun indulging over the long weekend. Even as trains and flights to popular tourist destinations were full and tickets sold at a premium, there was a significant uptake in the number of bookings, especially for domestic travel according to estimates by city-based tour operators and travel agents.

 “We did not expect the market to revive so well. While the market is a little slow, bookings have certainly picked up well, beating the demonetization woes. While road trips have been quite popular with people heading to short-haul destinations, domestic destinations accessible by air are also increasingly popular,” said Manoj Shah, president, Tour Operators and Travel Agents Association, Gujarat.
 
 Popular destinations include Udaipur, Mount Abu, Saputara, Diu and Gir, among others. In fact, other destinations such as Goa, Pondicherry, Jaipur and Ajmer are also increasingly becoming popular. Apart from these, bookings to short-haul international destinations were equally good.
 
 “There has been a rise in short haul destination bookings to Dubai, Singapore and Thailand. These destinations have always seen increased interest on account of easy accessibility and minimum travel time combined with the leisure of weekend holidays,” said  , managing director of a travel company.
