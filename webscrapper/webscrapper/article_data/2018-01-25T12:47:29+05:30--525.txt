PUNE:   theatre (now Victory) on East Street was crowded on Wednesday with members of Ithihas Sanshodhan Mandal and the Hind   who had gathered to commemorate 75 years of the bomb blast carried out by a group of freedom fighters on January 24, 1943.

 Historical references, newspaper reports and books written by freedom fighters refer to the trigger on August 9, 1942 when 16- year-old   hoisted the Indian flag. He was killed in the police firing ordered by the British. A woman also died in the police firing at  . 
 
 “People, particularly youths, were upset with the British treatment towards Indians. Underground freedom fighters led by Haribhau Limaye and his friends hatched a plan to carry out bomb blasts at three theatres in   area where British soldiers and their family members would watch movies every evening,” Mohan Shete, president of  , said.
 
 The group, he said, was looking for ammunition. “They heard about Bhaskar Karnik, who was working as a supervisor in Ammunition Factory, Khadki. They met him and Karnik stole ammunition from the factory and handed it to the group. They learned to make bombs and devised a timer,” Shete added.
 
 Freedom fighter Haribhau Limaye’s book “Karagrahatil Pathake” says, “The plan was to carry out three blasts at Empire, Westend and Capitol theatres. The group wanted 16 people for the mission but couldn’t get them. So they dropped Empire theatre.”
 
 The plan was to be executed on January 26, 1943. “ It was preponed to January 23. The group managed to place the bombs in two theatres. The bomb did not go off at Westend as British soldiers spotted it and defused it. The blast at Capitol theatre took four British soldiers’ lives,” Limaye said in his book. Karnik and the other freedom fighters were arrested in six months.
 
 Limaye’s son   told TOI, “It is necessary to make people aware about our freedom fighters’ contributions.”
