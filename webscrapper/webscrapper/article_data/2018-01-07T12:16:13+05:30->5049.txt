DEHRADUN: Income-Tax (I-T) sleuths on Saturday recovered Rs 12 crore unaccounted assets in raids conducted in a   hospital and a school owned by four business partners.
 
  The partners also included a doctor couple and sleuths also found irregularities in the construction of a hospital in Haldwani.
  
  The revelations come two days after a a team of income tax officials from Dehradun conducted surprise raids at five spots in Haldwani owned by city businessmen.
  
  The businessmen have been identified as   Sharma, Surendra Kumar Bhotiyani, Giresh Kumar Gupta and Dr   Juyal.
  
  Amrender Kumar, principal director (investigations) of the department told TOI that the total value of undeclared assets might go up to Rs 25 crore. “We have found several incriminating documents related to land deals, which would be scrutinized by our teams,” he said.
  
  According to documents, the construction cost of the hospital was Rs 12 crore and after close scrutiny I-T sleuths found that it was over Rs 30 crore. “The accused admitted the unaccounted income of Rs 12 crore while the raids were going on. Our teams are looking minutely into all the investments and other assets,” Kumar added.
  
  The hospital was built in 2013-14 and the I-T team suspects the actual cost would be more than Rs 30 crore. The IT teams have also found documents related to six bank lockers in Haldwani. The four businessmen had come under the I-T scanner while probing another hospital owner in Moradabad.
