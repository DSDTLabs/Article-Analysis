KOLKATA: Bengal chief minister   has expressed concern at the recent   at  . As India's neighbour turned 46 on Sunday, Mamata said that Bengal is with Bangladesh to support it in all possible ways, when terror attacks are happening. 

 There was a terror attack at the Dhaka airport on Thursday evening, in which the lone terrorist was killed. In the terror attack at Shyllet, six people are feared killed, including two terrorists and two policemen. Forty-three persons were injured in the encounter and two RAB officials who were seriously injured were admitted to a Dhaka hospital, as they were airlifted from Shyllet.
 
 Following the terror attack, a high alert had been sounded along the Indo-Bangla border as some terror elements might cross the border. Till Sunday night the security forces had cordoned off the area, but they could not reach a vantage point, as there were regular firings from inside the building in which the terrorists had taken shelter. 
 
 Army and RAB (Rapid Action Battalion) had been deployed to sweep out the terrorists who had taken shelters in a five-storey building in Pathanpara and had planted IEDs (explosives) around the building, so that security forces do not enter the building. The security forces were deployed since Thursday and on Saturday, they rescued about 78 civilians who were trapped inside the building and were kept hostage. On Sunday evening too there was fire exchange.
 
 From Friday when the security officials asked the terrorists to surrender, they did not respond. Instead, there had been firing from inside the building. On Friday, the army used rocket launchers to make holes in the building. However, the terrorists had been also throwing explosives and firing at the security men, for which the security men are yet to enter the building.
