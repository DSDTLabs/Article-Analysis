AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has ordered the state government to provide round the clock protection to a British citizen from the time he lands in India because he is a witness to crime, and fears for his life in coming to India to depose before the court.

 According to case details, Ashish   was at his in-laws’ in Sayla of   district in 2013 when there was an incident of assault and rioting. The violence took place over a land dispute. Brahmbhatt had lodged a complaint with police. The accused were booked for attempt to murder, rioting and under the Arms Act. After this incident, he returned to Scotland, where he has been living for more than 15 years.
 
 Five years later, Brahmbhatt is the only witness left to be examined by the court. He feels unsafe and demanded police protection. He filed an application in this regard with the high court, which ordered the Sayla police inspector “to look into the matter”.
 
 Unsatisfied with the order, Brahmbhatt filed another application in the high court, which conducted an inquiry into the case. Brahmbhatt’s advocate,  , said that the court was informed that some of the accused are history-sheeters and were externed from the district but are still moving around in the town. 
 
 After this inquiry, Justice   ordered the state government to recognize that Brahmbhatt is an important prosecution witness and that it take steps to provide him with adequate protection. “In such circumstances, from the date he lands in India, till the time his evidence is over, appropriate police protection shall be provided,” the order reads. Brahmbhatt is to arrive in India on February 2 and will take the witness box on February 9.
