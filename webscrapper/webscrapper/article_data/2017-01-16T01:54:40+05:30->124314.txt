GHAZIABAD: The arterial road of   in   is flooded due to overflowing drains, leaving the residents of nearby highrise apartments in a fix.

 According to residents, the drains of the area have been brimming for the past several days. The situation took a turn for the worse on Sunday, when waste water from the drains began overflowing onto Mall Road, making commuting on the stretch difficult. Residents of at least two dozen housing societies in the area use the stretch daily.
 
 In the past, residents had complained to the   Development Authority (GDA) over improper disposal of waste water in the area. On Sunday, members of Green Team, an association formed by women from several housing societies of the area to maintain civic amenities, tried to evict   and vendors setting shop alongside the road. The vendors, however, refused to budge. Residents allege that the drains of the area are clogged due to waste and garbage thrown by the hawkers.
 
 “We have invested our money in houses in the area with the assurance that we will be provided with excellent civic amenities. The authorities should consider that this area is inhabited by human beings and that we should get the facilities that we deserve,” said general secretary of SPS Heights AOA, Deepam Kapoor.
 
 “We were in the process of awarding a contract for cleaning the drains in the area when the assembly elections were announced. The tender could not be sanctioned and is still pending with us. The tender can be awarded only after the model code of conduct is lifted after the elections,” GDA executive engineer Chakresh Jain told TOI.
