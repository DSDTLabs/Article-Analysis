Chennai: Six weeks after a special court for bomb blast cases refused to give   the custody of Mohammed Mubarak, prime accused in the murder of Hindu Munnani spokesman Sasikumar, Madras   has set aside the order and asked the special court to rehear the matter.

 A division bench of Justice M Venugopal and Justice R Hemalatha passed the order while partly allowing an appeal moved by the NIA against the trial court order dated March 16.
 
 Sasikumar was hacked to death by a four-member gang at Subramaniyampalayam, Coimbatore on September 22, 2016. Initially, the case was investigated by Coimbatore rural police. It was later transferred to CB-CID (SID). In February 2018, the investigation was entrusted with the NIA.
 
 On March 16, when the NIA applied for police custody of the accused, the special court rejected the plea. Aggrieved, NIA approached the high court.
 
 The bench observed that the March 16 order of the Special Court for NIA Cases, Poonamallee, substantially affected the rights of the appellant agency, especially when the matter was at the investigation stage. Opposing the plea, Mubarak contended that the order passed by the special court was an interlocutory order and therefore, the present appeal preferred by NIA was not maintainable. Refusing to accept the submission, the bench said: â€œThis court significantly points out that as per Section 21 of the Act, the appeal preferred is to be heard by a division bench and the high court's power as per section 21(4) of the Act, is co-extensive with the powers of the special court.
