GURUGRAM: A resident of Noida, working in a kitchenware company in Gurugram, had his mobile phones and cash robbed by four people while he was heading for home from office on Saturday night.

  (32) hailed a cab passing by from Iffco Chowk. He told police he had asked the cabbie if he was heading to Noida, and got a reply in the affirmative. Three other people were already present in the car.
 
 A few minutes into the ride, all four accused started thrashing him up. “They snatched both my mobile phones and my wallet containing Rs 5,000 in cash. They put a knife to my throat and a gun on my head and threatened to kill me,” he told police. They also kept asking him for his ATM pin, he added.
 
 The car, which Tomar was unable to describe, turned at   and went towards   2, before stopping close to the DLF Square building. The accused continued thrashing Tomar, asking for his ATM pin, but when Tomar told them there was no money in his account, the accused threw the card and fled.
 
 When Tomar raised the alarm, he caught the attention of a security guard in the area, who helped Tomar inform police. An FIR was registered early on Sunday at Sector 17-18 police station, under sections 379B (snatching with the use of force), and 34 (common intent) of IPC, and relevant sections of the Arms Act. Investigating officer ASI Devi Charan said a team is trying to collect footage from   cameras in the route described by Tomar, to gather clues from it about the car and the whereabouts of the accused.
 
 Recently, Gurugram police had arrested a gang of four people and recovered a sedan in which they used to give lifts to people, before robbing them, and solved 11 similar incidents of robbing. The probe which led to the arrest of the gang had started when a man was robbed in similar fashion in March, after he had taken a lift from Iffco Chowk.
