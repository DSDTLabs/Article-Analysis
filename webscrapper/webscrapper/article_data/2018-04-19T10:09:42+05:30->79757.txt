If   is re-elected to office, it will consider nominating pourakarmikas to local bodies, CM   said in   on Wednesday.

 
 Inaugurating a meeting organised by pourakarmika leaders, he said, “The Congress government in the state has provided various facilities to pourakarmikas including enhancing their salary, abolition of contract system and health facilities... If we come back to power more such developmental works and welfare programmes will be taken up.”
 
  Swachh Bharat is a gimmick by the Centre, he said, adding that “real cleanliness is being ensured by pourakarmikas”.
