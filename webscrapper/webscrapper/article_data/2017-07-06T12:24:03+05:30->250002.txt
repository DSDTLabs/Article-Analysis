GREATER NOIDA: Coming heavily on officials of   (NPCL) that provides power to Greater Noida and Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) that provides power to Noida and rest of Gautam Budh Nagar,   vented anger for not keeping in check   including lack of proper supply, open panel boxes and loose wires leading to many deaths of locals by electrocution in the Jewar-Dankaur area recently. Singh was attending a review meeting of district administration at the collectorate under the aegis of UP excise and prohibition minister Jai Pratap Singh along with MLAs Pankaj Singh (Noida), Tejpal Nagar (Dadri) and district magistrate B N Singh.

 Excise minister Jai Pratap Singh, who is also minister in charge for Gautam Budh Nagar district took stock of development initiative in the district on Wednesday at Surajpur collectorate.
 
 While all MLAs reprimanded the officials of district authorities, NPCL and PVVNL for their lacklustre attitude in resolving public grievances, Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh expressed anguish over the poor power distribution system in rural areas. "NPCL should provide an immediate supply of 15 hour to rural areas and all officers should take their responsibilities seriously,” said Singh.
 
 Directing PVVNL general manager and officials, Jewar MLA maintained that in the past one month there have been many deaths due to 11000 volt line in rural areas of Greater Noida especially Dankaur, Jewar, Bilaspur areas and more where mostly the cables were found loose or hanging low. “There is immense anger and resentment amongst the people on deaths related to electrocution in these areas. Such accidental deaths should be immediately avoided by rectifying loose cables, faulty transformers, open panel boxes etc. which are all found at numerous places in these rural areas,” said Singh.
