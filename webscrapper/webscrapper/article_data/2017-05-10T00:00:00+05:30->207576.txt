Actress   of   fame didn’t seem to have the ideal start to the new week. She was trolled online and on TV channels for allegedly choosing a Tamil project over a   film. There were statements attributed to the youngster that read that her career was more important than Kannada films. 

 After being trolled online, Samyuktha chose to take to her Facebook page to clarify, “Kannada is my mother tongue and I respect it immensely, my first preference is always Kannada. Before judging, please know the truth and understand the situation. Everything you see and listen on TV isn’t true. I didn’t give any offensive statements. My language is my love. I don’t need anyone to explain it to me. (sic)"
 
 When we contacted Samyuktha about the alleged Karthik Subburaj-Prabhudheva film that was the bone of contention for the trolls, she said, “There is nothing to talk about. I am not doing it.” The actress, meanwhile, resumed work for the Kannada film Kaalej Kumar on Tuesday.
