BHOPAL: Eye on elections, finance minister   on Wednesday presented a Budget aimed at political harvest than growth economics.

 There was little for industry, job creation or urban living as MP’s beleaguered kisan made up the bulk of the FM’s speech — some 20 minutes — and allocations — Rs 33,564 crore. Plus, an additional Rs 2,745 crore as state share in central schemes for farmers and nearly Rs 11,000 crore for irrigation.
 
 
  
 
 As much as Rs 37,498 crore of the Rs 186,685 crore budget has been earmarked for agriculture. Interestingly, this is over
 
 Rs 16,851 crore more than the size of the first state budget presented by the BJP in 2004.
 
 With a word of caution on global economic challenges, Malaiya started his over 90-minute budget speech with a couplet: “Ae zinadgi mushkilon ke sada hal de, fursat ke kuch pal de / Dua hai dil se, sabko sukhad aaj, aur behetar kal de (O life, give me answers to problems, and moments of peace / I wish everyone a happy today, and a better tomorrow).”
 
 
  
 
 As soon he started reading out the budget proposals, the Congress benches erupted, accusing the government of neglecting the state. With an amused smile every time the Opposition shouted, the FM carried on presenting his fifth consecutive budget. Revenue expenditure increased from nearly Rs 13,4497 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 15,5624 crore, he said. With revenue surplus of Rs 262.5 crore for 2018-19, total revenue receipts of the state are estimated to be Rs 15,5886 crore. The state’s own tax revenue is Rs 5,4655 crore — 18% higher than the last one.
 
 Right since 2004-05, the state government has demonstrated better utilisation of financial resources, leading to increase in the state’s share in the country’s economy from 3.48% to 3.84%, Malaiya said. As expected, he earmarked a large chunk for agriculture, almost overlooking industrialisation that took priority for the past few years.
 
 The allocation for farmers’ welfare and agriculture development department is a whopping 87% higher than last year —from Rs 4,961crore to Rs 9,279 crore. In contrast, the allocation for MSME was slashed from Rs 933 crore to Rs 852 crore, and department of industry policy and investment promotion department got a marginal raise from last year’s Rs 797 crore to around Rs 940 crore.
 
 Chief minister   called the budget “historic and welfare-oriented”, remarking that it includes all sections of society and gives impetus to women empowerment, farm welfare, poverty alleviation and employment creation. “The budget crossed Rs 2 lakh crore for the first time, which is historic. It also stressed on food, clothes, shelter, education and medicare for poor and farmers and their families,” said Chouhan after the budget was presented in the assembly on Wednesday.
