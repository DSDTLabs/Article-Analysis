Panaji: The Goa Meat Complex, Usgao, is in the news yet again for non-payment of salaries to its staff. The salaries of around 50 regular staff haven't been paid for three months since January this year. Managing director D M Naik Parrikar, in a letter to the director, animal husbandry, and ex-officio joint secretary, department of animal husbandry and veterinary services, on January 23 requested for grant-in-aid to the tune of Rs 1.98 crore to pay salaries of regular employees from January to March, wages of contract workers from May 2017 till October 2017 as well as meet other urgent time-bound contingencies, expenses including upkeep of machinery and vehicles and procurement of a pneumatic stunning gun. Last week, Naik Parrikar, in a reply to the Goa Goverment Employees Association's letter over non-payment of salaries, said the corporation is entirely dependent on quarterly grants from the government for salaries and expenses. He said the file for the grants is in process with concerned goverment offices.
