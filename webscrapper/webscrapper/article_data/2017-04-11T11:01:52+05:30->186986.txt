BENGALURU: With bridges virtually burnt between the JD(S) and eight rebel MLAs, the party has started inducting leaders to replace the suspended ones. On Monday, JD(S) state president H D Kumaraswamy formally inducted two former MLAs from Nagamangala -- L R Shivarame Gowda and Suresh Gowda from the Congress. 

 At the event, Kumaraswamy took a pot shot at the rebels, including sitting Nagamangala MLA N Cheluvarayaswamy, by recalling the embarrassment the JD(S) faced after eight of their legislators voted for the Congress candidate in the   elections in 2016.
 
 "For some people, money has become more important than trust, loyalty and love showered upon them. The eight MLAs had the audacity to defy the party whip. Their exit may have been portrayed as a big loss to the party. But I don't think so. For me, the loyal workers of JD(S) in Nagamangala are the real strength," Kumaraswamy pointed out.
 
 Kumaraswamy said, had it not been for Cheluvar ayaswamy who opposed the induction of Shivarame Gowda previously, the latter would have been in the party 10 years ago. Shivarame Gowda had contested against Cheluvarayaswamy in the 2009   elections from the BJP and lost. He had joined the Congress after the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. 
 
  At the other end, Suresh Gowda, who defeated Cheluvarayaswamy in 2008 MLA elections, quit the Congress to join the JD(S). Suresh Gowda was a S M Krishna loyalist and decided to quit the party after his leader joined the BJP. 
 
  Kumaraswamy hinted that Shivarame Gowda will be considered for a ticket in Bengaluru, by recalling that the Nagamangala leader had sought a ticket previously from the JD(S) to contest from either   or any other constituency. The JD(S) has suspended all its three Bengaluru MLAs, including B Z Zameer Ahmad Khan from Chamrajpet, K Gopalaiah from Mahalakshmi Layout and Akhanda Srinivas Murthy from Pulakeshinagar.
