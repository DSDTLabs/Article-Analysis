KOZHIKODE: On the fourth day of the strike called by Kerala Government Medical Officers Association (KGMOA) that paralysed the health service sector in the state, a youth was forced to stage a sit-in to admit his mother to a government hospital here.

 Sukesh has taken his 51-year-old mother Kanakavalli, who has been suffering from leg pain and infection, to Kozhikode Government General Beach Hospital on Saturday.
 
 The doctor at the casualty referred the patient to   Hospital citing lack of doctors at the hospital due to the strike, called by the association in protest against the extended outpatient duty time of doctors in government hospitals.
 
 Sukesh said though he had approached the medical college hospital, he was told that the treatment could be continued at the beach hospital after conducting all the tests at the medical college.
 
 “When I took my mother to the beach hospital again on Monday morning, they declined to admit her citing the strike. I cannot afford to take her to aprivate hospital. So I insisted that she be admitted to the beach hospital,” he said.
 
 District collector   and district medical officer Dr V Jayashree visited the hospital following the sit-in protest. The issue was finally resolved after  , MP, held discussions with Sukesh and the district authorities.   said the patient has been admitted to the beach hospital now.
