HYDERABAD: Following a petition by Youth for Better India about demolition of a school for children of daily wage labourers,   has now sought a report from   and district collector on the issue before July 31. NGO-run Alpha school in   was demolished in June 2015. 

 The school, located on a footpath at Jubilee Hills Road No 22 , was allegedly demolished citing security concerns as it fell on way to AP CM N Chandrababu Naidu's residence. While State Commission for Protection of Child issued orders in 2015 to district education officer and district collector to shift students to the nearest government school, it failed to yield any result.
