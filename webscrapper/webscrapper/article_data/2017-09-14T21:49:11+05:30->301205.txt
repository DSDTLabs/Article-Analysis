Ludhiana: Accusing the Congress of failing to fulfil its election promises, BJP leaders will stage a protest outside the the mini- secretariat on September 16, which is, incidentally, a holiday. BJP leaders said the Congress government, after six months in power, could not do its duty and development has come to a standstill. However, sources said both leaders and party workers are not looking forward to staging the protest in the hot and humid weather. One of the leaders said it would be tough on party workers because of the weather but they have to go ahead because senior leaders announced the demonstration. 

 BJP district president Ravinder Arora said the Congress has not done anything in the name of development in the past six months and had stalled work instead. On the one hand, he said, the government released a multi-crore development plan for Ludhiana but on other hand, the MC does not have funds to pay salaries to staff and even vehicles are being denied fuel. He said the government, led by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had not fulfilled a single poll promise. District vice-president Parmider Mehta said they will bring party workers in large numbers to highlight the failures of the government.
