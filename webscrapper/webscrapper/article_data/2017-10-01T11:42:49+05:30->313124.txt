INDORE: It’s said an Ustaad’s best ‘guru dakshina’ is to be beaten by his disciple. Hurled to the mat by Indore’s teen grappler Apurva Vaishnav, champion wrestler Kripa Shankar Bishnoi got up beaming – the pain of his fractured finger swamped by the joy of being outmanoeuvred by his shagird.

 Bishnoi, who coached   for Dangal, had to undergo a surgery for his fracture on Saturday but is all proud of Apurva, a 17-year-old. “Every coach wants his athletes to outperform him someday. In fact, I am quite happy about the injury,” he said.
 
 Apurva told TOI: “Whenever he is in Indore he visits the SAI centre, where I practice regularly, and helps me master different moves and skills of wrestling. Two days ago, he was teaching me the ‘double leg attack’, during which he fell down on the mat when I tried the manoeuvre on him. He got hurt.”
 
 Bishnoi always finds time to coach her whenever he is in Indore, said Apurva’s father, wrestler Ajay Vaishnav, who was watching the practice when the Dangal muscleman got injured.
 
 “Kripa Pehalwan came to practice with Apurva after a long time and wasn’t aware of the speed and power that she has developed in the past few months. As he asked her to try out the manoeuvre, she took him by surprise and unfortunately Kripa Pehalwan got injured,” said Ajay.
 
 Bishnoi is happy that the feisty teenager has mastered the double-leg attack, which is Olympic bronze medallist Sakshi Mallik’s favourite move.
 
 Comparing Apurva with actress Fatima Sana Sheikh, who played the character of Geeta Phogat in Dangal, Bishnoi said: “Apurva is young, quick and very aggressive. Just like Fatima she is a keen observer and picks up skills taught to her quickly. I have very high hopes of her.”
 
 Apurva is the only female wrestler from Indore in the under-17 category to qualify for the world championship in 2016. She aims to beat her idol, Vinesh Phogat, in the ring one day.
