VISAKHAPATNAM: The Communist Party of India (Maoists) of Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee has called for a state bandh on May 21, demanding special category status for the state. They alleged state and central governments intend to deceive the people. They further claimed that the governments have not included proper promises for the development of the state in the bifurcation Act, which has no direction or objective. They urged the people not only to fight for SCS, but also fight for assurance to solve several basic issues related to agriculture, industry, adivasi, Dalit, minority, women, students, unequal development and others.

 AOB SZC Maoists urged people to beware of political gimmicks, as they will not help achieve the special status tag. They claimed that it could only be achieved through united struggle of the people alone. This special status should help improve the people’s socio-economic status. Maoists also urged people to be ‘beware’ cheif minister Chandrababu Naidu’s stand on the SCS issue. They claimed that Prime Minister   and Naidu are not committed to the giving the special status tag because they do not stand to benefit from it. 
 
 They said SCS will, however, not solve all the issues plaguing the state. People should know that Nagaland, Himachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, which have the SCS, are still lagging behind several other states in education, medical and health and also in employment.
