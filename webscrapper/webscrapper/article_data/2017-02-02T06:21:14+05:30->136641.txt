NEW DELHI: The   on Wednesday asked the   to constitute “authorities” as required under a new law banning  , so that proper survey can be conducted.

 A bench of Justices B D Ahmed and Ashutosh Kumar directed both Delhi government and the three municipal corporations to ensure that a proper survey is done to identify manual scavengers so that they can be rehabilitated as per the norms laid down under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013.
 
 The court’s direction came after amicus curiae Sanjay Poddar drew the HC’s attention to his report filed last year, which said that rules under the Act have to be notified by the state government followed by bringing in “inspectors” who will carry out the survey.
 
 Appearing for the Delhi government, standing counsel Rahul Mehra assured the court that the government will start the process of conducting a survey as per the Act. The   had earlier identified the social welfare department as the agency which should carry out the survey along with the corporations.
 
 It had earlier pulled up the AAP government over its “failure” to frame rules regarding rehabilitation of manual scavengers in the national capital despite a law prohibiting the practice, reminding it that under the Act it is mandatory that the state government frames rules, failing which it ought to be penalised. 
 
 The HC has been hearing and issuing interim directions on a PIL filed in 2007 for rehabilitation of manual scavengers. It had earlier termed as “disgraceful” the existence of manual scavenging and said, “We are a country of poor people but not for poor people.”
