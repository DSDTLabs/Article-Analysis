AHMEDABAD: A special anti-corruption court in Bhavnagar on Friday once again rejected the bail application of suspended IAS officer  , in connection with corruption charges.

 The court had in March denied Sharma bail, before the anti-corruption bureau ( ) filed a chargesheet against him. On Friday, special judge M J Parashar said the mere filing of a chargesheet in the case does not change the situation and Sharmaâ€™s arguments for bail remained more or less similar to what he had to say during his earlier bail application hearing.
 
 On March 9, ACB filed an FIR with Bhavnagar police station stating that when Sharma was managing director of Bhavnagar-based Alcock Ashdown ( ) Ltd in 2007-08, he allegedly demanded and received Rs 25 lakh from a contractor named  . This was allegedly for approving payments to Sahayaraj.
 
 Sharma was detained and arrested as soon as he emerged from  , after the HC granted him bail in connection with a money laundering case.
 
 Sharma was first arrested in 2010 by ACB sleuths from Bhavnagar, in connection with irregularities in allotment of land in Bhuj. 
 
 Ten FIRs have been lodged against Sharma in the last eight years.
