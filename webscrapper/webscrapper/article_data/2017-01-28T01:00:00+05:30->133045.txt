For TV actor  , a visit to   in   before any exam was a must. Now, he still follows the ritual and visits the gurdwara before his new projects go on air. The actor, who grew up in  , was here for the promotion of his new show 'Ghulaam', and he took time out to visit the gurdwara. “Koi exam aisa nahin hua hoga jab main Bangla Sahib nahin gaya hoon. Bahut baar toh result aane se pehle bhi jata tha. Even now, whenever I am venturing into something new, I visit this place to seek blessings and pray for success,” says Vikas, who studied at the Delhi College of Arts and Commerce ( ). 

 He says his idea of college life was extremely chilled out so he opted for a course (B Com Pass) where he didn’t have to study much. “I also did two diploma courses while doing my graduation and later realised that my interest lies in acting and it was then that I moved to Mumbai. My college life was absolutely chilled out and DCAC was known to have the best parties and cultural events in the  , not sure if it is still the same. When I was in college, we had 'Euphoria' and some other bands performing at fests,” he says.
 
 Vikas makes an interesting observation about Delhi. He says, “Delhi people have mellowed down. There are not as many reports about incidents of aggression as there were a few years ago. I think the   is more strict now, which is very good. Even traffic, other than a few days in the week, is better regulated now.”
