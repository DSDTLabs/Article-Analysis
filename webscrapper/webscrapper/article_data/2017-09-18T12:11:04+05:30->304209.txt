THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Actor   has responded positively to Prime Minister  's call for his support to   government's ace campaign Swachh Bharat. He took to   to express his whole-hearted support to `Swachhata Hi  ' movement, but did not mention anything about the PM writing to him regarding the same.

 Saying that a responsible citizen should be proud of the nation, he called the country our home and home, our identity . “We need to keep our home clean, so that each one of us live in a clean environment and our guests (foreigners) would be happy to be with us. Which best day other than on Gandhi Jayanthi to promise ourselves that we would keep our home clean forever,“ said the actor in the FB post.
 
 The actor, however, wished the PM on his birthday in a separate post. In a letter dated September 9, Modi had personally appealed to Mohanlal to support the cleanliness campaign as it would help reduce the sufferings of the poor and down trodden.
 
 “A clean India is the noblest service we can do for the poor, downtrodden and the marginalised. Unclean surroundings adversely impact the weaker sections of society even more. Cinema is one of the most effective medium to bring about a change at a large scale. 
 
 Your participation in the mission would help connect to millions and inspire others to be part of the movement,“ the PM had said adding that the actor could share his experience with the PM via the Narendra Modi mobile app.
