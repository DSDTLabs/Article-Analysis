NAGPUR:   Phule should be considered as goddess of education as she was a true saviour of women who fought for their empowerment. Every school should put up a photograph of Savitribai and children should be told about her pioneering efforts in education field, said Anand Ingole, a poet and writer.

 Ingole was speaking at ‘Savitricha Elgaar’, a unique programme of poems and lectures, organized by   (SVM) to remember her contribution to education field at Mor Hindi Bhavan, Sitabuldi, on Tuesday. Well-known poets presented poems based on Phule and social issues concerning women’s empowerment.
 
 Poems like ‘Adhikar’, ‘Striya’, ‘Mazi aai Savitri aai’ and others were present. The poems mostly depicted the struggle of Savitribai which empowered women of the present time. “Phule was a modern poet who wrote poems on social issues, nature and various topics in an age when most of the contemporaries eulogized kings and kingdoms,” said Sunanda Borkar, chief guest at the programme. “Phule’s efforts to educate people created many great writers and poets like Mukta Salve who continued her fight for women empowerment,” added Borkar.
 
 Hriday Chakradhar, founder of SVM, said, “Savitribai was targeted for opening schools for women and she was even hit with rocks. But she continued to educate girls. Women from every caste were imparted education in schools started by Phule. She always focused on the problems faced by women due to orthodox views and fought social stigmas.”
 
  said, “Great leaders like Savitribai Phule, Jyotiba Phule, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and Shahu Maharaj worked for the uplift of the deprived class. They worked for providing justice to the exploited classes, including women.”
 
 Those present at the programme included Nalanda Satish, Yashwant Dongardiwe and  , besides others.
