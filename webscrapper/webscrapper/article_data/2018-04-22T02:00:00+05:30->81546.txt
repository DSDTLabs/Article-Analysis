PATNA: Bihar generated 6,098 intrastate e-way bills on the first day of its implementation in the state on April 20. So far 26,832 dealers from the state have been registered on the e-way portal since its launch on April 1.

 An   has to be produced for intrastate transportation of goods worth Rs 2 lakh or more, while an e-way bill is mandatory for interstate movement of goods worth more than Rs 50,000 or more.
 
 According to Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries president P K Agarwal, the new system is expected to make things easier for traders applying for documents for movement of goods. “The portal seemed to have slowed a little in the evening on April 20, but I am sure these problems will soon be resolved,” he said. 
 
 The e-way bill provision of the GST was introduced on February 1 this year. But the system was unable to bear the traffic load as several states started generating intrastate bills on the portal along with the interstate bills. Therefore, the implementation of the intrastate bill provision was put on hold. The platform has since been made more efficient and now it can handle as many as 75 lakh applications per day.
 
 The GST helpline numbers (0612-2233512/13/14/15/16; 9199273130/9472457846 and toll-free number 18003456102) provide assistance related to any queries regarding the new system.
 
 Officials said majority of the queries received by the helpline on Day 1 related to the amount limitation. “People sought to know if the amount had increased or decreased from Rs 2 lakh for an intrastate bill. Some others also asked if new vehicles also had to generate a bill for interstate movement of goods,” said an official at the call centre.
