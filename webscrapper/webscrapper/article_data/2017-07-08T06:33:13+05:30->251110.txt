PUNE: Arundhati   has delved into her treasure trove of experience, garnered over the past 25 years, for her latest creation that presents classical dance with a   

 Pathawardhan, daughter of renowned Bharatanatyam exponent  , explains that she was often troubled with the relatively limited scope of classical dance. “On several occasions, I have been questioned about why classical dance never goes beyond the romance between Radha-Krishna or the tales of a young Krishna.This got me thinking about experimenting with the dance form,” she said.
 
 In an attempt to answer the questions, Pathawardhan has come up with a seven-composition performance that will depict scenes from daily life, like the relationship between a flower and a bumble bee and the issue of ego in today’s era. The event, titled Anugraha, will be staged on July 9, 10am, at Balshikshan Mandir Auditorium, Mayur Colony.
 
 A group of 25 dancers, who have been practising for the past two months, will present the compositions. “The group includes four of my mother’s disciples, who will be performing along with their students,” said the 42-year-old. The annual programme, which is open to all, was initiated four years ago to commemorate 50 years of Chapekar’s career in dance.
 
 The performance is divided into seven compositions called Rangadwar, Kamalavimala, Tandavalasya, Panchatav, Kanduka, Shollapillala, Tanam. “While Rangadwar is the opening act, according to the Natyashastra, Kamalvimala which translates to a fully blooming lotus, showcases the relationship between a flower and a bee. Tandavalasya portrays the male and female aspect of every being. The act called Kanduka uses a ball as a metaphor for ego and portrays the problems it may create.,” explained Pathwardhan.
 
 She further added that most compositions are linked with   to enhance the performance.
