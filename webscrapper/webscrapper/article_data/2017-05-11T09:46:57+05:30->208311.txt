NASHIK: Come June 15, all government school students will receive   for free on the first day of the academic year.

 The bureau of textbook production and distribution ‘Balbharati’ and the Nashik district education office have started joint efforts to achieve this target.
 
 Depot manager of Balbharti, Nashik, Laxman Damse said, “This year, Adivasi Ashram Shalas (residential schools in the tribal areas) and   in the remote and hilly regions of the division will be given preference for the distribution of textbooks. We are planning to distribute 99,30,346 textbooks this year on the first day of school. The books will start being sent to the respective centres from Balbharati’s Nashik office from Thursday. A private logistic company has ensured timely delivery of the books.”
 
 The   and the municipal corporations in the Nashik division have been given a specific username and password to register their demands for books online. “The supply will be carried out as per the demands, which will ensure proper supply of textbooks. All textbooks of   are also available for free to download on its website,” said Damse. 
 
 Balbharati’s Nashik depot looks after the supply of text books to Nashik, Dhule, Nandurbar and parts of Jalgaon and Ahmednagar districts. It has planned to distribute books to 44 centres across the division. “These include 40 tehsil headquarters and 4   headquarters,” added Damse. 
 
 In the last two years, the state government has made it a point to provide free textbooks to the students of Std I to VII in all government schools. But, in 2015, the government failed to distribute textbooks, due to which many residential schools in the tribal areas were deprived of the textbooks for over six months. They improved last year and distributed over 86 lakh textbooks to more than 15 lakh students.
