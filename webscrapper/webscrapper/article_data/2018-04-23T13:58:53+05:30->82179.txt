KANYAKUMARI: Timely warning of rough waves measuring as high as 8 feet to 12.5 feet averted loss of life and major damages to property. At   a boat that was tied to the shore was dragged into the sea by the giant waves and went missing. 

 
 At Alikal a boat that was tied to the shore was badly damaged.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 The district administration relocated 100 persons totally. Around 36 people were relocated from Alikal, 30 from Pillaithoopu, and 34 Kollamcode to marriage halls in safe places as the waves went high and even entered a few houses and streets close to the shore. Arrangements for food and basic amenities were made for them.
  
  
 
 
 
 Officials said that these people would return home after water has drained from the localities and when the sea is back to normal (expected by late night on Sunday). Waves were rough at Madaikadu, Pudur, Kurumpanai, Kottipadu, Neerody, Vallavilai, Eriyumanthurai, Thoothoor and   coastal villages. Waves washed away connecting roads in few villages.
  
  
 
 
 Police personnel were deployed at prominent tourist spots while ropes were also tied at a few places to prevent tourists from entering the sea, as it would be deadly. District collector Prashant M Wadnere visited a few affected areas and supervised the arrangements made there, to ensure the safety of the people.
  
  
 
 
 
 Boating to Vivekananda Rock and Thiruvalluvar statue at Kanyakumari was banned for the second day in succession on Sunday. This left the weekend and summer holiday tourists disappointed. Due to the early warning of rough seas in the districtâ€™s shores, the number of tourists also saw a dip in the last two days.
  
  
 
 Though the sea was calm at Tiruchendur and nearby areas in   district, as the waring was predominantly for Rameswaram and Kanyakumari districts, devotees to the temple and tourists were however not allowed to go close to the Bay of Bengal. Police were deployed at all the approach routes to the sea, as the sea is unpredictable.
