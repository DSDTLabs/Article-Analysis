MUMBAI: Independent legislator   dropped a bombshell by claiming that around 25 op position MLAs were in touch with him and would vote for NDA candidate   in the presidential elections on Monday.

 “Opposition members are happy with the functioning of chief minister  . He has cleared works that were pending for many years,“ Rana said.
 
 However, the opposition rubbished Rana's prediction.“There won't be any crossvoting and Rana is trying to appease Fadnavis as he wants to work get done. Everyone wanted to be with the ruling party to get some benefits,“ said NCP spokesperson  . As many as 288 legislators, 48 Lok Sabha and 19 Rajya Sabha MPs from Maharashtra are eligible to vote in the presidential elections.
