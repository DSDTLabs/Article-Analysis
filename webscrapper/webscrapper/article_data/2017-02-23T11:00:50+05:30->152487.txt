 The 25-year-old from   district was trafficked to Delhi by her cousin several years ago when she was a minor. The girl complained of ill-treatment at the hands of her employer and said she was given less food and wasn’t given any money during her stay there.
 
 The girl was later rescued by   and NGO Shakti Vahini on May 11 last year. She was kept in a shelter home as police were unable to trace her family.
 
 Aarti Kujur, chairperson of Jharkhand State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (JSCPCR), said, “We are still trying to locate her family.”
 
 Rishi Kant of Shakti Vahini said, “The girl was kept as a bonded labourer at her employer’s house for two years. During this period, she was not allowed to step out of the house, was given very less food and was ill-treated.”
 
 “The girl has been given a bonded labourer certificate after proper investigation. This is probably the first of it’s kind case where a domestic help has been declared a bonded labour,” he added.
