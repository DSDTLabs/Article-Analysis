PATNA: At least 25 BArch (Bachelor of Architecture) and BE (Bachelor of Engineering) students of   (BIT-P) have given facelift to a small roadside eatery with the help of used bottles, bulbs and tyres, among other waste materials. The eatery, popularly known as ‘Prakash Dhaba’, is located near the BIT-P campus.

 The students have painted the walls and written interesting quotes on them. “We have also drawn various colourful caricatures which are sure to catch everyone’s attention instantly,” said third year BArch student  , who conceptualized the idea along with his friend   Aman, a third year BTech student.
 
 The tin-structured dhaba had lost its charm over the years and very few people went there. Many students, like   didn’t want to lose it. 
 
 “I always want to do things in a way that they benefit people. This is just a stepping stone... On March 15, my friends and I asked  , the dhaba owner if we could make a few changes to make the eatery look beautiful and lively. He agreed and we started the renovation work from the next day,” Shubham said, adding noodles, omelette, ‘pakora’, ‘samosa’ and cutlet sold at ‘Prakash Dhaba’ were quite popular.
 
 Aashish, on the other hand, told this reporter, “We had been planning to help   Bhaiya since October last, but due to certain constraints we could not. We began the work on Thursday night and are still renovating the dhaba, using graffiti, small structures made of cane, lights in colourful bottles and tins. We are making seating arrangements and colouring the floor as well.”
 
 Beaming with happiness, Prakash said, “Students have really worked hard and transformed this place. I could not recognize it at first. I’ll try to maintain it.”
