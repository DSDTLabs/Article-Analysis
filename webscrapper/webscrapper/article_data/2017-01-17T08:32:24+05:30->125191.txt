NEW DELHI: Former Uttar Pradesh   chief Laxmikant Vajpayee, grandson of former CM Kalyan Singh and party secretary Shrikant Sharma are among the 149 names announced by BJP on Monday for the state assembly polls. 

 Most of the seats will go to the polls in the first two phases on February 11 and 15.
 
 Vajpayee has been fielded from Meerut, from where he is the sitting MLA while Kalyan Singh's grandson Sandeep Singh and Sharma will make their electoral debut from Atrauli and Mathura respectively .
 
 Releasing the list, the party's Central Election Committee's Secretary JP Nadda said it has accommodated various sections of society. The CEC had met on Sunday night to finalise the candidates. It has retained sitting MLAs, including Sangeet Som and Suresh Rana, both accused in Muzaffarnagar riot cases which have been dismissed as a conspiracy .
 
 However, mystery remained over the fate of Union home minister and UP heavyweight  's son Pankaj Singh whose name did not figure in the list.
 
 BJP has withheld announcement of its candidates for some seats, including Sahibabad and Noida - two seats from where Pankaj Singh's name has been doing the rounds.
 
 The party's CEC will meet again on Tuesday to announce names of more candidates.
 
 While it is buoyant about its prospects in a state where it has been out of power since 2002 with the arrival of sitting MLAs and leaders from various rival parties into its fold, there is speculation that  , a BSP leader who had joined the saffron party months back, is unhappy with the leadership over choice of candidates.
 
 The party has been pulling out all stops to win UP, which in terms of political implications is more significant than the other four poll-bound states.
