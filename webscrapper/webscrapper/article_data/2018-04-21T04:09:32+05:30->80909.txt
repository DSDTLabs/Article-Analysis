KENDRAPADA: Following a night of prayers and preparation, the deities of a 400-yearold temple, located on what is considered to be the fastest-eroding sea beach on Odisha’s long coast, moved house to a village 12 km inland on Friday. 

 Local residents and the   administration moved the five deities of the Ma   in   village of the district to a rehabilitation colony at   on two big boats. The goddesses’ journey to a safer abode also saw an ancient custom being suspended for a day. 
 
 Male workers and temple sculptors entered the altar of the temple — so long the exclusive preserve ofpriestesses — for the first time in 400 years, to heave the 1.5-tonne black granite idols out. “This is a very emotional moment for us. Since time immemorial, married Dalit fisherwomen have been worshipping the deities at the temple. The marching sea forced us to move the temple to Bagapatia,” said  , one of the priestesses.
