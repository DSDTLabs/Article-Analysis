 Actors   and  , who were in the city on a recent weekend for the promotions of their TV serial  , made the most of their visit by pampering themselves. Interestingly, while other actors prefer to roam around Lucknow and see the city, the two actors spent most part of their day in a parlour located at Gokhle Marg. 
 While Bhumika got nail extensions and her hair done, Indraneil got a new hairstyle for himself. In fact, Bhumika also went for a manicure and a pedicure. “I wish I had more time, I can spend my entire day here and get everything done which I usually miss because of my hectic shooting schedule in Mumbai,” said Bhumika, adding, “I have been to Lucknow only once before which was purely for professional reasons. At that time I was unable to go shopping and couldn’t even taste the famous  . However this time I have a lot of spare time at hand. So after pampering myself in the parlour I will be going to eat the kebabs.”
 Completely in awe of Lucknow’s parks, Indraneil said, “While on my way from the airport, I saw the huge   which looked so beautiful from outside. If I had more time, I would have surely gone and seen the park from inside.”
