MUMBAI: A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSOA)   on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a serial   to 14 years in jail for raping a   by posing as a cop in 2014. Earlier this year, another court had convicted   (25) and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment for sexually harassing a 14-year-old girl in a similar manner.

 Cops alleged that at noon on August 9, 2014, the victim was at home with her younger brother. A person entered their house and introduced himself as a policeman. The victim said the man, who she later identified as the accused, told her that if she scored a good percentage in her Std X exams, she would be taken in the police force. He also allegedly told them that he had spoken to their father. He then allegedly sent the victim’s younger brother outside, claiming he had to take the minor’s measurements for entry into the force. He told the child to undress herself. When she refused, he raped her and left the house. The victim immediately called her mother and narrated the incident; an FIR was lodged.
 
 In the other case, the child had said that when she had gone to a shop in a market close to   station, the accused threatened to tell her parents that she was speaking to a boy. He claimed he was a cop and asked her if she watched a TV show which dramatized real-life instances. The child told police that he kept trying to get closer to her, making her feel very uncomfortable. She said he then told her that he would show her how rape happens and tried to show her video clips.
 
 Luckily, her mother and two maternal aunts arrived in an auto-rickshaw at that time. The cops were called and he was held.
