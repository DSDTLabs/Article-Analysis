 In the 38-minute documentary, employees of Rhythm House share some memories while they worked at the iconic store.

Another employee shares an experience that touched his heart ' he says he knows a customer who, for 27 years, used to drop by on birthdays of various artists like   to just distribute sweets to the entire staff.
  
  
  
 
 Aliya Curmally, daughter of Amir Curmally, chairperson of Rhythm House asked her friend, screenwriter and filmmaker Megha Ramaswamy to make a documentary on the iconic music store. Megha, who is a music lover herself and was a regular visitor at Rhythm House, jumped at the offer and made 'The Last Music Store'. She told the Times Of India, 'I met Aliya at a writers' workshop years ago and since then, we have been friends. She approached me and I was delighted to work on this since I, myself, am not just a music lover but I loved Rhythm House and visited there whenever I could. There was no structure in mind that this is how I will make it, the 38-minute video that you see seemed just right. And I have had people tell me how they were moved to tears as they could relate to the concept of their favourite stores shutting down.'
  
 This documentary will be screened at Bombay Art Society in Mumbai on February 24 at 7pm.
