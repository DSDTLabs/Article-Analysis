KANYAKUMARI: Villagers, who have been opposing the proposed international container transhipment terminal at Kanyakumari, went on a fast near the site at   on Friday even as the district administration and authorities concerned could begin preliminary study for preparing the detailed project report (DPR).

 Close to 2,500 villagers, comprising women and hundreds of children, took part in the one day fast that was organised by the People’s Movement Against Kanyakumari International Container Transhipment Terminal, near Kovalam. The movement comprises members of more than 10 organisations and villagers from close to 50 villages.
 
 It is the first protest organised by the people against the proposed project. Over the last one month, the villagers chased away officials who tried to conduct the study twice and also told the district administration during a peace meeting earlier this week that they will not allow them to conduct the survey anywhere in the district.
 
 Kurumbanai C Berlin, one of the coordinators of the People’s Movement Against   International Container Transhipment Terminal, said the project earlier proposed at Enayam was dropped by the government due to a series over 50 string protests including 48 hunger strikes organized by thousands of villagers.
 
 “Our only demand in the first protest organised on Friday is asking the government to drop the project. Of the five types of   landscapes, Kanyakumari has Kurinji (mountain),   (forest),   (cultivated) and Neithal (coastal). The government should not make it Palai (desert),” he added. tnn
