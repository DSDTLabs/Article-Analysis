AHMEDABAD: To resolve job- and deployment-related issues of policemen, and even their personal problems, DGP Shivanand Jha on Friday revived the police grievance redressal committee which was set up in 1989 but later became defunct.

 In a circular issued to all SPs and city police commissioners, the DGP said, “It is the duty of senior police officials to resolve the issues of their subordinates, whether job related or personal. Here the cops can put up their problems and all efforts will be made to resolve them.”
 
 Jha mentioned in the letter that the committees would be set up at district, city and state levels. “Each police station of the district and headquarters should have two policemen or officials and representatives from different classes and ranks, including women, in the committee. Similarly, in cities, each division should have two members and representatives from different classes, ranks including that of woman police officials and personnel,” added Jha.
 
 According to the circular, these committees should hold a meeting in the first week of every month and sent a detail report to the DGP office which would then scrutinize it. “The state-level committee would be headed by the DGP himself with DGP administration, additional DGP police reforms, one police officer of the rank of IG and one of the rank of SP in the committee.
 
 “The state-level committee would hold a three-monthly meeting and bring quick solutions to the issues raised by police personnel and officials in the district- and city-level meetings. “A separate committee would also be set up for the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) with the same structure,” added Jha.
