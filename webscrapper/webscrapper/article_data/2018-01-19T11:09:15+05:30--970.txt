CHANDIGARH: With the suspense over   Singh’s continuation in the council of ministers ending, many of his former colleagues are already eyeing the two plum portfolios of power and irrigation. For now, chief minister   has kept the two departments with himself.

 Speculations are rife that where heath minister   could get power ministry, rural development and panchayat minister   may bag irrigation. However, there is still no confirmation on this. “It is the CM’s prerogative to decide on the portfolios and there can be no lobbying,” said a party leader. 
 
 Ever since the controversy against Rana Gurjit flared up, some senior Congress leaders have made “courtesy calls” to the high command, including party president  , over the last few days. Confirming such a meeting, a senior party leader said it had nothing to do with the proposed expansion of the council of ministers or reshuffle of portfolios. Where the Congress government has not appeared to be in any hurry to go in for cabinet expansion, a review of the one year of performance of the present council of ministers is also on the cards. 
 
 Amarinder said on Thursday that the induction would be based on the twin criteria of youth and merit and party circles are abuzz with the possibility of party president Rahul Gandhi’s loyalists like Kuljit Singh Nagra and   managing to get a cabinet berth. A section of Congress leaders still feel that the new inductions in the government may take longer than expected. “There is a bunch of senior MLAs, who have been waiting to get a cabinet berth all these months and it remains to be seen how the party leadership will handle the issue in the run up to the next   elections,” said another leader.
