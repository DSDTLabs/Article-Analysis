COIMBATORE: Construction of the faecal sludge treatment plant (FSTP) at  ,  ,000 households in two town panchayats that were not covered by the underground sewage system,  .

 The plant would start to treat household sludge from July, said  , senior specialist with the   (TNUSSP), which is functioning with the state government in improving urban sanitation at   and Narsimhanaickenpalayam on a pilot basis.
 
 “With a sewage treatment plant in Ukkadam, kilometres away from the rural areas that lack underground sewage system, safe disposal of faecal wastes from the septic tanks continue to pose a serious threat both to the environment and humans,” he said.
 
 FSTP would reduce the travelling time and decentralize the treatment system based on the requirement of the particular region. Upon decentralizing, the expenditure would come down, Chakraborty said.
 
 The plant, with the capacity to treat over 25kiloliters per day ( ), has two chambers to carry out aerobic and anaerobic treatment on the faecal sludge. It was constructed at the cost of Rs 2crore. “As a knowledge park would be established around the plant on 1.3 acres, authorities said that the treated water would be used for landscaping within the premises or distribute the water for farming purpose as the quality of water would be good. The solid would either be used to make fertiliser or used as compost for the crops,” the official said.
 
 With numerous industrial plants around, there have been instances of mixing industrial affluent with the sludge, and in order to avoid such instances, quality check of the sludge would be done twice – from sludge collecting trucks and after treatment, Chakraborty added.
