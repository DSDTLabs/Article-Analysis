VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh has become the first state in the country to get support for a   under the   established by the Union government. 

 The scheme, which is known as Abhaya, is envisaged to provide safety to women on road. As part of the scheme, autorickshaws in Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam will be fitted with devices enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT). This gives more accurate information on location of vehicle and by pressing a simple button on their mobile, women can directly send alerts to police on their command control system.
 
 At present, both the cities have about 50,000 autos. Of them, only about 15,000 are registered. As IoT is more updated than regular GPS system, the officials have chosen this method and explained to the selection committee for sponsoring the projects under the Nirbhaya fund various schemes. This is possible through 'share my route' application.
 
 On the other hand, the auto drivers have to spend a little amount on their mobile SIM cards for the IoT devices on monthly basis. The concept is unique in that the AP government will distribute the devices free of cost. "We have taken this decision after conducting a survey on the   given compulsorily to the auto drivers was not working. Only 400 out of the four lakh autos are using them," N Bala Subramanyam, transport commissioner, told TOI. 
 
 Though selection committee raised doubts over supply of devices to private vehicles free of cost, the AP delegation convinced it by showcasing the Delhi example where many drivers stopped paying instalments for  , rendering the scheme a failure.
