Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh will dedicate second phase of the Jang-e-Azadi memorial to the nation on March 6, at Kartarpur in Jalandhar. The CM took the decision during a meeting held at the memorial on Saturday. The Punjab government had on Friday released Rs 5 crore for the project and the remaining amount of about Rs 9 crore was likely to be released soon. First phase of this project was completed in June last year.

 The memorial is spread across 25 acres and was first sanctioned in July 2012 at a cost of Rs 315 crore. The memorial includes a minaret, seminar hall, auditorium, movie hall, cafeteria, library, an open air theatre for laser show and an amphitheatre.
 
 Amarinder said the state-of-the-art memorial would give a major fillip to the tourism sector in the state and lead to Kartarpurâ€™s emergence on the world tourist map. The memorial showcases various facets of the freedom struggle. He described the memorial as befitting tribute to the great heroes of the independence struggle.
