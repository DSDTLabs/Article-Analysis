Tuticorin: Curiosity has always put cats in trouble. A black cat in a village in Tuticorin district of Tamil Nadu might have realised it on Thursday after its head stuck in a steel pot. Murugammal, wife of Muthukumar of Komaneri near Sathankulam, kept curd in a steel pot. While she was busy cooking, the cat put its head in the pot, and its head got stuck.  The terrified cat ran out of the house with its head stuck in the pot. It reached the road. Clueless where to go, it wandered for a while before it sat on the road. A woman named S Paradesiammal tried to help the cat but suffered scratches on her hands. Some people brought a hammer and a crowbar to cut the pot open. But others raised concern as the cat could die in the rescue process.  Someone suddenly seemed to have recalled the saying “there’s more than one way to skin a cat” and brought a cutting plier. A portion of the vessel was cut with the cutting plier, and a villager carefully brought the cat’s head out of the pot.  When it was freed, the cat ran away as villagers cheered.
