GANDHINAGAR: While   is facing internal troubles over allocation of ministerial portfolios and places in the cabinet, Gujarat  , which won 77 seats in the recent assembly elections is also experiencing internal strife with more than a dozen leaders staking their claim to the post of   (LOP) in the assembly.

 From January 3, the Congress started a two-day meeting of elected MLAs to decide the next LOP and chief whip of the party in Gujarat. On the very first day of the meeting senior leaders threatened of revolt if they didn’t get the coveted posts.
 
 Sensing major loss of face, state Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki took the decision to bar reporters from the Congress office except for a few minutes given to take visuals. The meeting was chaired by state Congress in-charge   and senior leader Jitendra Singh.
 
 Kuvarji Bavaliya, former MP and senior Koli leader straightaway demanded the post of LOP. He said, “I have ensured the party’s victory on 30 out of 54 seats in Saurashtra. OBCs are 52% of the population and 27% are Koli. So my claim to the post is natural. I have served as MLA for four terms and one term as MP.’’
 
 Paresh Dhanani, the young Patidar leader who is considered a frontrunner for the LOP post also staked his claim, but avoided making any inflammatory statement.
 
 On Thursday, Congress will meet North and Central Gujarat MLAs.
 
 All the 77 newly elected MLAs of Congress in Gujarat today formally ‘authorized’ party president   to take a final call about the selection of the leader-of-opposition and other related posts including deputy leader and whip, said Solanki.
 
 Gehlot and Singh will give their feedback to All India Congress President Rahul Gandhi about candidates for the posts on Thursday evening.
