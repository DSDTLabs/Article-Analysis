HYDERABAD: The Humane Society International-India has written to   secretary   to implement the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Dog Breeding & Marketing) Rules, 2017, on the grounds that dog breeders are violating the rules. 

 
 HIS-India Managing Director N.G   said: "The intention of the law to introduce dog breeding & marketing rules is to curb illegal and inhumane practices of the unregistered dog breeding centres. The responsibility for implementing the rules rests upon state animal welfare boards and law enforcement agencies. Majority of the breeders in Telangana are not registered, despite the existence of Telangana State Animal Welfare Board. The purpose of the rules is to regulate the dog breeders, to avoid animal cruelty and to avoid the increasing number of abandoned breeding dogs."
 
 Jayasimha alleged in the letter that, "No breeding centre or shop adheres to the housing requirements, and dogs are kept in cramped spaces without any regular source or food. The sale of puppies below the age of eight weeks is prohibited. However, puppies below 4 weeks of age are sold across shops and even online. None of the conditions like microchipping, maintenance of health record and weaning period are fulfilled. None of the individuals who carry out breeding activity in Telangana have obtained the required registration certificate."
 
 Recently, an FIR was registered following a complaint alleging that nearly 100 stray dogs were culled and dumped in a forest area. The complaint was lodged by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) on May 16, saying unidentified persons were picking up street dogs from   area and 'killing' them at the nearby   forest, police said.
 
 Police said about 100 carcasses were found near the forest and a case was registered under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and also under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.
