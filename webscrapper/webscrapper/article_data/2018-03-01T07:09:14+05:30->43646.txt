KOLKATA: The city may not have been what it is today had the port not been established. It was the country’s first and the second busiest in the world when it was born on October 17, 1870. And now, Kolkata   (KoPT) has embarked on a mission to showcase its heritage. As a first step, it has organized an orientation tour — ‘Voyage – Through Tide and Time’ for travel operators with assistance from Incredible India.

 
 “We would like to encourage people to travel along the river and catch a glimpse of the heritage. One of the major attractions is the Indenture Memorial, a staging point for most of the Indian diaspora. Maybe, students of history in colleges and universities can be trained as guides and paid an honorarium to be present during the tours. Initially, such tours can start on an aggregator basis till operators get sufficient numbers of their own. We can have 2-3 tours on weekends,” KoPT chairman   said. According to him, a short film can also be made and screened during the tours.
 
 
  
 
 According to KoPT security adviser and heritage researcher  , the port is flooded with inquiries and the tours can start very soon after final modalities are worked out. “If we are able to market it well, people from across the world will visit Kolkata to take the ‘Kolkata Boat Ride’ or ‘Kolkata Port Boat Ride’, whatever we choose to call it,” added KoPT deputy chairman Balaji Arun Kumar.
