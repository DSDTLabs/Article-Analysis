Tirupur: Two children from Dindigul district, who were spending their summer vacation at their grandfather’s farm at Udumalpet here,  

 The victims were identified as Sudharsan, 11 and Rohit, 7, sons of Godhandaraman of Saminathapuram in Dindigul. “They were studying in class V and II respectively in a private school in Udumalpet. They had come to visit their grandfather T Rangasamy in Thanthoni near Udumalpet after the summer holidays began. On Thursday morning, the grandfather took the boys to his farm, where he had to water the crops. While the 58-year-old Rangasamy was busy in the work, Sudharsan and Rohit were playing alongside the 6ft artificial farm pond, which was used for storing water. When the grandfather noticed that the boys were missing, he searched for them in various places, but in vain. Family members, who conducted a search in the farm pond, found their bodies,” a police officer said.
 
 Preliminary investigations suggested that Rohit could have slipped into the pond and Sudharsan might have tried to save him. 
 
 Udumalpet police have registered a case.
