Mumbai: BMC’s public   department is finalizing a plan to provide free nutritional support for patients undergoing   treatment, officials said on Thursday.

 “The aim is to provide comprehensive treatment to all patients registered under the RNTCP (Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme) as well as the Private Practitioners Interface (PPIA),” said BMC   control officer Dr Daksha Shah. PPIA is a model evolved by   in 2014 to increase private sector participation in the public sector TB control programme.
 
 “Our PPIA model has been appreciated at the national level,” said Dr Shah. From 1,500 in 2014, the PPIA programme has enrolled 19,653 patients in 2016,” added Dr Shah. The idea, she said, was to ensure that people not comfortable seeking help from the public health system due to stigmatisation, can get treatment. Patients not only get access to quick and free diagnostics tests for TB, but also get free medication which is given to the private doctor by BMC. “This should be looked at as a way of increasing adherence to drugs among patients,” she added.
 
 In 2016-17, BMC treated over 42,000 patients with TB; while 19,653 were from the PPIA arm, the remaining were directly under the central government TB programme operated by BMC.
 
 Since February, BMC has started a slew of programmes to improve adherence to treatment but the dropout rate has been an area of concern. Instead of taking nine tablets a day, BMC has started a fixed dose combination that requires patients to only take four-five tablets a day.
 
 BMC has also started a phone-in system so that it can track adherence to medication among patients. Patients have to dial a number to register that they have taken the day’s medication. “Our officials follow up with people who don’t call up. At times, people have not understood the mechanism or are doing something wrong,” an official said, adding that 70% patients phone in every day.
