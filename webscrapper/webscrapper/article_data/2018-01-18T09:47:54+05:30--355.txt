LUCKNOW: An   looms over   if the   fails to   in a fortnight. The aqueduct developed a leak last week due to which the department had to shut supply from Sharda Canal to allow time for repair. However, the shutdown has resulted in stopping supply to the   too which provides water to both these localities with a population of over five lakh.

 Water can be lifted from the canal only if its level is at least six metre inside the canal but at present it stands at 1-2 metre. Jal Sansthan’s executive engineer said, “Kathauta Reservoir has supply stock of up to 15 days, after which the localities will face acute supply crisis if the irrigation department doesn’t repair the leak.
 
 The aqueduct, a concrete structure that is almost 50 years old, was designed to last over 100 years. However, a seal broke last week, resulting in heavy leakage in the structure above Gomti. The leakage would have worsened if not repaired immediately. Hence, the irrigation department had to stop the canal’s supply in the upstream of Kathauta to lower the water level and allow repair of the seal.
 
 The shutdown is now causing supply problems in almost 14 districts of UP in the downstream region. Irrigation officials have suggested to Lucknow’s Jal Sansthan department to use pumps to lift water from the canal but the latter said the water level was so poor that even pumps could not lift water.
 
 Irrigation officials said a retired navy officer, who specialises in underwater projects and their repair, has been roped in to fix the leakage within a week. His team visited the leakage site on Wednesday to determine the extent of damage and the expected time for repair. An official said, “The navy officer has offered solutions to fix the damage in a week.”
