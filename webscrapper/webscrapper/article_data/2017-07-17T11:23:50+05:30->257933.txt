Diabetes, often seen as a rich man's disease, is assuming epidemic proportions among the urban poor in “rich cities“ and is more prevalent in states with higher GDP, shows a recent study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) across 15 states.The findings, published online in ' ', said Chandigarh, which has the highest per capita annual GDP of $3,433, recorded the highest prevalence of   at 13.6% while Bihar, with the lowest per capita GDP of $682, had the lowest prevalence at 4.3%.

 In economically better off states like Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tripura and Manipur, and UTs like Chandigarh, diabetes is more common in rural areas than in urban areas. But in contrast to urban areas, diabetes was more common in individuals of higher   in rural areas of all states.
 
 “The spread of diabetes to economically disadvantaged sections of society is a matter of great concern, warranting urgent preventive measures,“ the study said.
 
 In urban Chandigarh, diabetes among the lower socio-economic strata or poor people was as high as 26.9%, double the incidence (12.9%) for the well off. In Bihar, the trend was reversed with incidence among poor in urban areas only 4.7%, compared to 5.4% among the rich.
 
 Experts identify lifestyle as a major cause of increasing diabetes in affluent states. “Urban poor are usually migrants. They undergo a big change in diet and stress levels. Less healthy food and less exercise can be causes of diabetes,“ said Anoop Misra, chairman,   C-DoC.
