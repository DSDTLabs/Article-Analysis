KOCHI: Collection of   from different parts of the city has been affected as the   failed to expedite the process of awarding work to firms which won the tender. Following a dispute over selection of the firm which quoted the lowest, a court had asked the corporation authorities to hear the complainant before awarding the work. 

 But the local body authorities couldn't complete the process even one month after the court order. Though plastic waste is rarely seen on streets, there are heaps of them in many of the households in the city. "Due to problems in clearing plastic waste, officials with health department in the corporation are learnt to have given instructions to Kudumbashree workers not to collect waste from households for the time being. This has led to piling up of waste, especially plastic waste, in households," said V P  , councillor from Champakkara.
 
 According to corporation authorities, the disposal of waste is now almost normal. "We are clearing waste from every point in the past few days. If plastic waste is not being taken from households, it might be due to the apathy on the part of Kudumbashree workers," said  , chairperson, health standing committee. She said that the remaining issues also can be solved as the civic body would soon be awarding the tender for transporting garbage to solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram from different parts of the city. 
 
 "In place of the existing system of paying the transportation agent on the basis of trips they conduct, we have introduced a payment system based on the weight of garbage transported. Biodegradable waste and plastic would be transported separately. Two firms have secured the work for transporting plastic and garbage. The work would be awarded to these firms within a couple of days," she said.
