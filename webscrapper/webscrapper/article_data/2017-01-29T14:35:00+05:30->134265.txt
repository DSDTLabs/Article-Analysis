MYSURU: In a scuffle that broke out between two friends of   near   late on Friday, one of them allegedly   and fired in the air. However, no   has been registered with regard to the incident.

 Sources said that Ramakrishna and Keshava, both of whom were Rakesh’s friends, had a longstanding feud over a real estate deal. The latter allegedly wanted to settle a score with Ramakrishna, and had been waiting for an ideal opportunity to take him on. Keshava and his friends allegedly accosted Ramakrishna at a pan stall in Gokulam, which the latter was in the habit of frequenting, and picked up a quarrel. 
 
 Two of Ramakrishna’s friends who were heading out of a bar nearby saw that he was being attacked and rushed to his rescue.
 
 Ramakrishna allegedly told Keshava that he was responsible for Rakesh’s death since he had taken the chief minister’s son to Belgium. The two groups exchanged blows, before Keshava, who had a licenced firearm allegedly took it out and fired in the air. Night beat cops who arrived at the spot took Ramakrishna’s inebriated friends to the JL Puram police station, while Keshava’s friends, Diwakar and Muralikrishna were admitted to a private hospital.
 
 Although members of both these groups were summoned by police on Saturday for an inquiry, no complaint was registered. Police have, however, recorded the incident, treating it as a non-cognisable offence.
 
 City commissioner AS Rao told STOI, “We have received no complaint. We would have definitely filed a complaint if a firearm had been used. I cannot comment on what happened without knowing the details of the incident.”
