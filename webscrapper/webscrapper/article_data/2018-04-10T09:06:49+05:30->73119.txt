INDORE:   has sent notices to over 300 promoters/builders for failing to update the status of their respective projects on   website. 30 per cent of these   are from Indore.

 According to the rule, all registered projects need to be updated every quarter with all latest development and pictures on the website. Failing to comply with the rule may invite action from the regulators. 
 
 MP RERA chairman Anthony de Sa said, “Our main focus is now to keep an eye on quarterly update of the projects on the website, if anyone fails do to so we will send notices and take action.”
 
 De Sa said the regulatory body has already sent over 300 notices to promoters for failing to update their projects. 
 
 Arun Nair, a builder and member of the   (CREDAI) said, “Several builders are not able to update the details due to lack of proper knowledge and infrastructure mainly at small places.”
 
 Builders said quarterly updating of   is difficult as construction activity is very slow due to delay in getting permissions from government departments. 
 
 Another senior official from MP Real Estate Regulatory Authority said, “It is mandatory for all registered projects to update in every three months. At small centres, builders may not be fully aware but in cities like Indore and Bhopal, people have full knowledge of all the mandatory norms.”
 
 As on date 1,750 projects have been registered with RERA from across the state of which around 425 projects are from Indore. 
 
 De Sa said, “Registration of projects is going at a good pace across the state. For those who have still not registered their projects, we are picking them up and sending notices.”
 
 According to the regulatory body, around 50 unregistered projects have been detected for which notices have already been sent.
