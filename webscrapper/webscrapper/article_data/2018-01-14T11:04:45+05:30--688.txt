 PREVIEW
 
 Optimism mingled with an eagerness to know what lies ahead as India's potential future stars geared up to lock horns with Australia in their big- ticket campaign opener of the ICC U-19 World Cup here tomorrow.
 
 Coached by the distinguished Rahul Dravid, there is no dearth of talent in the sqaud, and the former India captain's sprightly boys would have got acclimatised to the conditions by now having arrived many days prior to the start of the tournament.
 
 India are three-time champions, the last triumph coming in 2014.
 
 While Dravid, who has been at the helm of U-19 and India A squad for some time, may not like to focus on individuals, it is very difficult to not see the likes of skipper Prithvi Shaw as the a vital cog in the team's batting wheel.
 
 Alongside Shaw, who has created ripples with his exploits in the domestic circuit for Mumbai, there is Himanshu Rana, who has also amased plenty of runs in Youth ODIs.
