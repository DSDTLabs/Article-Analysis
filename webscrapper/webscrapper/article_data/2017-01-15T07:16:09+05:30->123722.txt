 “At first, I couldn't understand her as she was crying continuously. I asked her to calm down and speak slowly. She told me that her friend Amith had been shot dead by Rajesh. She said, 'The killing will defame me for my entire life and I cannot live with this humiliation. Amit's family has a lot of influence and they will make my life hell. I am also going' and cut the call,'' Keerthi said. 
 
 A panic-stricken Keerthi tried to her back, but in vain.Later, he remembered Shruthi saying she was in a lodge opposite Sapthagiri Hospital and passed on the message to his relatives who lived close to it. Within an hour, Keerthi and others reached the lodge and broke down the door, only to find Shruthi hanging from the ceiling.
