Lucknow: The grand entrance of the Nana Sahib Memorial Park is the most outstanding part of  . The memorial built at Nana Sahib’s palace by the state tourism department was a major public attraction with a number of visitors trickling in despite the May heat. 

 Outside the main gate, a flexi-banner carries image of a woman and the text states it’s a real photograph of Rani Laxmibai clicked in 1850. The picture is in possession of an antique collector in Ahmedabad, who, on great request, agreed to exhibit it in Bhopal on the occasion of World Photography Day recently. Bithoor was Rani's ‘nanihal’ (home of maternal grandparents). 
 
 The walls have history writ all over it. What is written nowhere is the unfortunate fact that most of that palace is now encroached by slum dwellings. State government is fighting a legal battle with those encroaching the palace. A part of it is locked and is a treasure of history with relics of   lying inside. 
 
 The adopted son of Bajirao Peshwa (II), Nana Sahib led the first war of Independence against British in 1857 along with   and Rani Laxmibai. His palace was burnt by British. State tourism department has built a Nana Sahib memorial park on 12 acres land. But the palace sprawls over 52 acres, close to 25 beegha. The memorial also has a museum.
 
 “It is where the Rani played in her childhood,” said Madhukar Rao Moghe, descendant of one of the commanders of Bajirao Peshwa (I). He added, “The 52 beegha palace had seven wells around it but now only those inside the palace are left, rest are encroached.” 
 
 Inside the memorial is a well in which women and children living in the palace jumped into to escape humiliation at the hands of British but it is restricted for public viewing or use though it has not gone dry. 
 
 When TOI visited the palace during assembly elections recently and spoke to the political party candidates, all of them blamed rivals for the sorry state of affairs.
