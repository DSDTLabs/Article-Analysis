KOLKATA: A 26-year-old homemaker was charred to death at her residence on Monday evening. According to cops, the incident was reported from a makeshift single room located on a terrace of an old building at 159, Ahiritola in north Kolkata. The victim has been identified as Sreemoyee Pal.

 “The fire broke out around 7pm. By the time the neighbours noticed the fire, it had engulfed the room. Six fire engines responded to the call and the flames were brought under control in an hour. When the rescue team began searching, they found the charred body,” said DC (north) Subhankar Sinha Sarkar. The woman was rushed to RG   where she was declared brought dead.
 
 Cosp said the woman is survived by her husband who owns a small clothes’ shop nearby. The couple’s 3.5-year-old daughter was at her tuition when the incident took place. “We cannot ascertain how the fire started. We have been inside but found no stench of gas. At present, short-circuit cannot be ruled out. Whether it was an accident or suicide can be ascertained only after the autopsy is conducted,” said an investigating officer. The statement of her husband and neighbours are being recorded.
 
 It was almost two years ago that a similar fire nearby had claimed the life of one person and gutted over 10 shops. “The area is densely populated. Even in this building, there were numerous tenants occupying single rooms. It is not always possible to save lives when a fire breaks out here,” explained a fire department officer.
 
 Locals, though, claimed Pal was preparing food around 7pm when the fire broke out.
