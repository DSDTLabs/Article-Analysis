THALASSERY:   Subeesh's confession has thrown light on two other   in Kannur. The trial in a murder case has been stopped following the revelation to conduct a further probe.

 Subeesh confessed to the police that he drove the vehicle used by the assailants who killed the   K Pavithran at Thodeekkalam near Kannavam in 2009.
 
 Subeesh said Manoj, an RSS leader, asked him to come to Sangh office in Thalassery . After reaching the office, he handed over the key of a black colour Bolero. Four persons boarded the vehicle from Thalassery and two or three from Kannam with weapons inside a sack.
 
 On reaching Kannavam after midnight, Subeesh was directed to take the vehicle to Thodeekkalam road. Pavithran, who was newspaper vendor, was riding a bicycle. The person sitting in the front of the Bolero knocked Pavithran down by swiftly opening the door. Those who were sitting behind alighted to attack Mohanan while Subeesh turned the vehicle. After the action they proceeded to Thalassery .
 
 Six RSS workers were arrested by the police in connection with the murder. â€œSome of them who were found not guilty were crying when we told them that their role in the murder is not confirmed," said a police officer. Following the revelations the Additional Sessions Court (Ad hoc) has stalled the trial in the Pavithran murder case and has ordered a probe.Subeesh also spilled the beans on another murder at Pappanpeedika near Thalaseery in 2007 a few months after the Fazal murder. He said around 20 RSS workers had assembled at a marriage function at Chembra where a discussion happened about an `action' at Madapeedika. After the talks, some persons from the group left in three bikes.
 
 The next day Subeesh came to know that CPM worker Jigeesh was murdered at Pappanpeedika. When he told this to an RSS leader, he replied the organisation would unleash propaganda that NDF workers had killed Jigeesh as retaliation to Fazal murder. But the police arrested RSS workers in the case.
