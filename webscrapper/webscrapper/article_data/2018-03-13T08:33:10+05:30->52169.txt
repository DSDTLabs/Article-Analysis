 Officials in the district child protection unit said the baby was born in   in  , near Thisayanvilai in Tirunelveli district, on November 19 last year. “She was weighing 1.25kg when a man named   brought her to the TVMCH. She was just one-day-old (on November 20),” said district child protection officer B S  .
 
 The child protection officer said her parents could have feared that the baby would not survive due to underweight and abandoned her at the TVMCH.

When she was handed over to the child protection unit on Monday, she weighed close to 2.1kg.
 
 After the collector named her, the baby was handed over to Saranalaya. Saranalaya director A Jayabalan said she would join nine other babies who are awaiting adoption at the centre.
 
 Meanwhile efforts have also begun to trace her parents by inquiring the hospital where the baby was born. “If we find the baby’s parents, we will try to convince them to take her back. If they are not interested, she will be ready for adoption,” Devananth said.
 
 At the same time, formalities for giving the baby for adoption would also begin on Tuesday. An advertisement will be released in the newspapers asking for her parents to take her back. If they don’t get any response for 60 days she will declared as fit for adoption. Particulars of the baby will then be uploaded online for adoption.
