KINGSTON: Jamaica's double Olympic sprint   was back in the winner's circle Saturday, cruising to victory in the 100m at the   in 11.06sec. Thompson, the 2016 Olympic gold medalist in the 100m and 200m, finished well in front of compatriots   (11.25) and   (11.26) in a race that saw Jamaicans occupy the top five places.

 
 Thompson's victory came 11 days after she pulled out of the Diamond League meeting in Shanghai with what meet organizers called a "physical issue."
