HYDERABAD: The permission of the gram panchayat will not be necessary to set up an industry in the geographical limits of the village. Even the election of sarpanch is likely to be through an indirect process i.e., the elected members of gram panchayat will elect one among them as the sarpanch, are among the significant suggestions made by the cabinet sub-committee in the draft of the new Panchayat Raj Act.

 The draft copy of the new Act prepared by the cabinet sub-committee headed by Panchayat Raj Minister   has made many more suggestions in the draft it submitted to chief minister   on Saturday for final approval.
 
 Sources said the cabinet sub-committee has sought the opinion of the advocate general, the Law department, other legal experts on some of the crucial subjects in the draft to avoid any legal constraints.
 
 The draft also proposes to set up an authority to take disciplinary action against local body representatives. Also, the proposed Act will spell out the powers of panchayats to approve layouts, giving building permissions etc. particularly in Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority area.
 
 "The draft also proposes to make the reservation rotation system once in every 10 years as against the present system of once in five years. It also spells out clearly about the attendance of villagers in tune with the population when gram sabhas are conducted. The Draft also talks about appointment of three co-option members in gram panchayat including one NRI," a source said.
 
  leaders including TPCC President N Uttam Kumar   said an indirect election of sarpanch may lead to "horse-trading" and demanded a direct election . Leader of the opposition in   Mohd   said the opposition parties were not consulted at all before preparing the draft. Both Uttam and Congress demanded that CM   should convene an all-party meeting to discuss the draft .
