PANAJI: The BJP is the only party that can solve the mining issue as the party has a Prime Minister in Delhi, health minister   said. 

 “We’re filing a review petition. Ultimately, the interest of Goa and Goa’s mining industry is utmost in the minds of the BJP,” he said. On whether it is too late to file a review petition,   replied, “No, everything has to be studied. Let them file the review petition and after that also there are ways and means of doing things. I think everything will start unfolding after the Karnataka elections,” he told reporters on Monday. 
 
 On the the Mhadei water dispute issue not being addressed at Amit Shah’s meeting on Sunday, Rane said, “The matter is before the Mhadei tribunal. Let it go on. The rightful decision will be taken by the BJP. Just because Amit Shahji came and did not mention something...that’s not important. He’s going to come again and we’re also going to go there,” Rane said. 
 
 Minister for art and culture Govind Gaude reiterated his stand on Mhadei. “Mhadei water shouldn’t be diverted under any circumstances. Not a single drop of water should be diverted to the Malprabha (basin),” he said.
 
 On watching chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s first direct video message on Sunday, Rane said it was not only “emotional” but “motivational”. “He’s a fighter. He will get well and will come back hail and hearty. Let him finish his course of treatment. The opposition doesn’t have to dictate terms to us. Let them go to high court or wherever they want. There are certain things in the democratic institution and democratic norms and we fit into the democratic norms. The   has been out of power for six years and cannot sit out of power for too long,” he said, dismissing the Conrgess’ protest as a desperate attempt.
 
 When asked whether the two Congress MLAs that he spoke of earlier, met Amit Shah, Rane said “who has to meet will meet”.
