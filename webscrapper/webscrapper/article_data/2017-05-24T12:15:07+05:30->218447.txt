The letter stated that of seven wards, ward No 1 has been shown as SC. It stated that there is not a single person from the scheduled caste, nor a single scheduled caste voter in that ward, thus depriving other backward castes (OBC) and the general category from contesting the panchayat election 2017. Villagers stated that it was the panchayat secretary’s responsibility to give a proper report about the composition of the population. Villagers also demanded strict action against the panchayat secretary and whoever was involved in presenting the audit for providing false information.
