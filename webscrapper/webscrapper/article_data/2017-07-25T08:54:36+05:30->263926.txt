NEW DELHI: By placing a   in the Jawahar Lal University (JNU) premises, the university will only be paying respect to the sacrifices made by those defence personnel who have trained at the university, the Vice-Chancellor of JNU   told ET on Monday.
 
  A controversy is raging after the V-C on Sunday asked two central ministers, V.K. Singh and Dharmendra Pradhan to help the university get a decommissioned tank to be placed on the campus. Kumar on Sunday at a Tiranga rally in JNU had said that the presence of the Army tank will constantly remind students of the great sacrifice and the valour of Indian Army & defence forces.
  
  "JNU has a very long association with many defence academic institutes. Cadets from Army, Navy and Air Force are trained here. Their degrees are given by JNU. These defence personnel are our alumni and we are proud of them," Kumar told ET on Monday. He said JNU is the "only university which has a close association with the security forces" in India. "When we want a decommissioned tank be placed on our campus, it is only in the context of recognizing and paying respect to the sacrifices of our own alumni," the V-C has told ET.
  
  When asked why a tank be installed for the purpose inside an educational institution, given some may see it as an object of destruction, Kumar did not comment further. The JNU Teachers Association has meanwhile rejected the idea of the V-C, saying "JNU cannot be made into a theatre of war." In a statement, JNUTA further said the JNU community does not need visual aids likes tanks to feel love and concern for the land, its environment and all its people, whether in armed services or elsewhere.
