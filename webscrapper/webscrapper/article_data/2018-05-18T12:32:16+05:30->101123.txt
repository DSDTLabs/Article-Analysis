BENGALURU: While Karnataka’s politicians stay up all night, get holed up in resorts, or hit the streets in protest, chasing their wildly swinging fortunes, the twitterati is sharpening its barbs and unleashing them on social media.

 
 As one joke went: “Manager of   resort is going to meet the governor to form the government as he has 116 MLAs with him.”
 
  
  
 After Governor   invited   to be sworn in as chief minister, a meme paraphrasing the lyrics of a popular Kannada song started doing the rounds on WhatsApp, “Governor to Kumaranna - If you come today, it’s too early. If you come tomorrow it’s too late...To Yeddi - You pick the time aaa tick tick tick tick tick tick….”
 
 Some smart alecs also utilized   teams. “RCB and DD to form an alliance to qualify for the IPL playoffs with their points combined.” The trolls spare no one, and are having a field day on Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp.
 
 One troll invoked shopping portal Amazon. Ritik tweeted, “Hey Amazon need help ASAP regarding some shopping issues.” When Amazon replied, “We’d be happy to help. Please elaborate on your issue”, Ritik replied, “I want to buy 7 JD(S) MLAs and gift them to BJP president Amit Shah, please provide the best deal.”
