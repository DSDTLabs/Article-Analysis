Pop star   is mourning the death of his father. 

 Attorney Jon Posner, 73, lost his month-long battle with cancer on Wednesday and he was laid to rest following a funeral service at the Ira Kaufman Chapel in Southfield, Michigan on Friday. 
 
 The ceremony included a touching tribute from the hitmaker, who honoured his dad with a cover of "Bright Eyes song First Day Of My Life".
 
 The singer previously referred to his dad's cancer diagnosis during a performance on US talk show Conan in May, when he changed the lyrics to his "I Took a Pill in Ibiza" track to reference the family issue.
