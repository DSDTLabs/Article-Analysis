PONDA: Miffed over the damage to the Chhatrapati   Maharaj bust at Tisk-Usgao by PWD officials in the presence of police protection on early Friday morning, the  , an NGO promoting Shivajiâ€™s ideologies, alleged that the government wants to clandestinely bring back Mughal rule.

 Usgao-Ganjem sarpanch Asmita   said the electricity department had put forth a request to remove the bust so as to erect a high mast street lamp in place of the bust. A resolution was passed by the panchayat to this effect in its meeting on February 23. 
 
 However, the electricity department denied any such request. "Our assistant engineer had requested for shifting of a defective pole as the statue could get damaged during the process of shifting electric cables to a new pole," executive engineer of electricity department, Sunil Wadekar told ToI.
 
 Later, the panchayat intimated the PWD department to remove the bust. However, president of Sarvajanik Shivjayanti Utsav Mandal, Naresh Naik, criticised the move. "The PWD has destroyed the statue by using an excavator. This is an insult to the great Maratha emperor," he said.
