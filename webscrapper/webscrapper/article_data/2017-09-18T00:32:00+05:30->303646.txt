Trichy: Tamil film director   has for the first time decided to shoot his upcoming film in Trichy. He was able to make up his mind after noticing the cleanliness maintained in the city. 

 “I find Trichy a clean Chennai,” said Seenu while interacting with students of EVR Periyar College as part of Sangamam, the annual alumni meet at the college, on the birth anniversary of rationalist Periyar E V Ramasamy. 
 
 He is teaming up again with actor Vijay Sethupathi for his upcoming film after the success of ‘Dharmadurai’ . “Since I belong to Madurai it was obvious that I have the story line based in the rural part of my region,” he said in reply to a question from a student, “but now I am convinced that I should shoot my next film in Trichy.”
 
 Reiterating on his anti-NEET stand again at the event, Seenu explained how he draw inspiration from DMK leader M Karunanidhi on chosing effective tittle for films. “Who would think about naming a film that speak about atheism after a Hindu Goddess unless Kalaignar,” said while referring to famous Tamil flick Parasakthi of Karunanidhi. 
 
 With all praise for Rajya Sabha MP Trichy Siva, Seenu said that he drew inspiration from the historic private bill that Siva brought in the Parliament to promote transgender rights.
 
 Mentioning a scene from Dharmadurai which speaks on transgender rights, Seenu has expressed his willingness to cast Rajya Sabha MP Trichy Siva, who is also patron member of the alumni association, in his film. 
 
 While Siva chose not to comment on the film offer, he expressed his satisfaction over seeing the large gathering of alumni unlike previous years. He asking them to make it a point to come to the college every year on alumni day and contribute to the development of the college. 
 
 Over 100 alumni of the college came for the alumni meet along with their family members. Retired Tamil professor C Nagarajan, and retired English professor K Natarajan also shared their memories.
