INDORE: Israel will soon set up two agriculture excellence centres in Madhya Pradesh in collaboration with the Union government to impart training to farmers growing flowers and oranges, Consul General of Israel David  , announced on Monday.

 “A total of 26 agriculture excellence centres are being set up in nine states of the country, while 15 such centres in states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana and Gujarat are already operational, 11 more will be developed soon,” said Akov while addressing a press conference in the city.
 
 In Madhya Pradesh, the two centres will come up at Shyampur in Sehore and Dheripal in Shajapur. At Sehore, the centre will train farmers in cultivation of flowers, whereas in Shajapur, techniques of growing oranges will be taught to farmers.
 
 Akov also suggested the implementation of ‘Moshav’, a community   concept prevalent in Israel, in India. It can help farmers double their income. This concept involves coming together of all farmers cultivating their produce adjacently and discussing and sharing ideas on how to optimize their production by finding out cheap and efficient ways of marketing, animal husbandry, buying seeds, fertilizers etc.
 
 “This practice has helped Israel greatly in doubling their agricultural income,” Akov added.
 
 Akov also interacted with Indore municipal corporation commissioner Manish Singh to discuss the possibilities of using technology for better management of the city and implementation in   projects. Akov also appreciated the IMC’s efforts, which led it to being ranked number one in terms of cleanliness. Akov said that the effort was visible on the streets of Indore city.
 
 Akov is the first member of the Israel embassy to have visited Indore.
