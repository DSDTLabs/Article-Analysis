LUCKNOW: Claiming to have cracked the   murder of a woman, Lucknow police said on Saturday that the crime was a case of mistaken identity. They said a local woman had given the contract for the murder of Lalita’s daughter but the woman ended up dead at home in   on September 1, 2017.

 Police made the claims after arresting  , the shooter in the case and his aide  , both of Barabanki, prime conspirator   aka Bitti and her aides Ram Nihal and a tailor identified as Rakesh, all of Gosainganj. They said Noorbano was in love with a youth of Pasin Dhakwa village where the victim also lived with her family. The said youth reportedly developed a liking for Lalita’s daughter. When Noorbano found out, she planned to eliminate her lover’s new love interest. She contacted Kanhai and   through Ram Nihal and   and gave the contract of Rs 1lakh to kill the girl.
 
 On the day of the incident, the shooter and his aide were given Rs 40,000 for the job with the promise of being paid the rest once the ‘job’ was completed, said police. SP (rural)   said both Kanhai and Ram Kumar reached Lalita’s house but mistook   for her daughter and shot her while she slept on a cot in the verandah.
 
 Meanwhile, on Friday, a police team was conducting routine check at Gosainganj when they stopped a suspect motorcyclist, who later was identified as Ram Kumar, the man who was with Kanhai at the time of Lalita’s murder. Police stumbled upon his link with the murder when they bluffed that his motorcycle’s registration number had figured in investigation of the case. Ram Kumar spilled the beans while pleading innocence. Police rounded up all the named miscreants thereafter.
