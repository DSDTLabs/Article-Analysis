NEW DELHI: From   for a  , finding out   of  ,   about errant auto rickshaw drivers to bidding for a fancy number plate,   offered by the Delhi government’s   and more would now be available at the click of a button.

 Soon, the department would launch a  , tentatively named ‘Delhi Transport’, which would put all online services of the department in one place. Transport department officials said that the “first version of the application is ready and it could be launched anytime soon”.
 
 The department has made a major push towards providing more and more services online in the last one year and the mobile application is the next step towards providing the services more easily to Delhiites under a single window.
 
 “The mobile application would be the front end for citizens and the back end will be integrated to the Sarathi and Vahan software maintained by National Informatics Centre (NIC) for specific services,” an official said.
 
  “The application would have add-ons too, like location of your RTO as per your address, training material for learning license etc. Then there would be links to Delhi-specific services such as online bidding for fancy registration numbers,” he added.
 
 The official said that apart from providing the department’s online services through the mobile application, it would also provide training material for beginners. This material would contain a question bank on the contents of a learner’s test and include information about road signs and traffic rules and regulations.
 
 “We want that apart from appearing for a driving test, people won’t have to visit a RTO at all. Around 50,000 people visit the RTOs every day and if we are able to provide all services online, not only would it make the experience of people hassle-free, but also ease the burden at RTOs,” the official said.
