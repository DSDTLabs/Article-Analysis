It was just a week ago that   started painting the series,  , on the lives that have been lost in the horrific conflict and violence in  . But his work, which highlights the emotions of homeless and orphaned children, lost families struggling to get basic healthcare, and starving toddlers on the streets who squeal with joy when a volunteer hands over a toy to them, have already piqued the interest, and tugged at the heartstrings, of many.
 
  
 “Seven days ago, my   friends and I were discussing this whole issue. We were shattered when we read and saw pictures from war-torn Syria. It was then that I decided to work on a series that would deal with this. I started downloading high resolution images from the internet. As you can see, I am not using colours for this series. The photos are originally from the internet; I am adding a sepia mode to the subjects. In this mode, the attention is diverted towards the subject’s emotion. I don’t know how many paintings I’ll make in this series, but I’ve already completed around 30 of them,” says Shreethar, even as he uses his digital brush on a subject.
 
  
  
 
 He has downloaded over 1,000 photographs and is in the process of refining the high-resolution ones because he says it is easier to highlight minute expressions in a detailed way. Life finds a way and even in this crisis, some photographs show a small curve on the faces of children. Shreethar says it is not easy to work on such topics as it breaks him down emotionally. The artist adds, “I was stunned to see kids with a smile even when they were going through such a painful situation. Some of them are homeless, and some have just lost their parents. But a small toy in their hand has brightened up their face. Some are playing in the temporary shelter without worrying what the next moment in their lives would be like.” Shreethar plans to exhibit this series in the city soon.
