Mumbai, Sep 30 (PTI) At a time when there is a debate about children's participation in reality shows, actor   believes they have the right to showcase their talent on the small screen. In July this year, filmmaker Shoojit   called for a ban on reality shows involving children.

 But Shilpa, who judges kids dance reality show "Super Dancer - Chapter 2", says her opinion on the subject differs from Sircar's. "Everyone has the right to have an opinion. I don't hold it against him for expressing it, there's always a different perspective on the same situation. 'Super Dancer' is a great platform to showcase one's talent and if dance is a child's forte, it's a great place to hone it,"   told PTI. "But that participation has to be the decision of the child and not be forced on him/her by the parent." 
 
 The dance reality show, which will on   from September 30, is also judged by   and Geeta Kapur.
