LUCKNOW: The resignation of BSP MLC   from Vidhan Parishad has jeopardised party chief  's attempt to reach out to upper castes.Singh was a key party functionary entrusted with the task of getting Thakurs into the BSP in west UP during the assembly elections. His wife was also a BSP MP.

 Mayawati appointed him and Ballia MLA Uma Shankar Singh to add Thakur votes to the party in west and east UP, respectively, after BJP's Daya Shankar Singh's adverse remarks against her. While dalits hit the streets in protest against the remarks, Mayawati struggled to retain Thakurs in her party following former BSP leader  's derogatory comments aga inst Daya Shankar's daughter.
 
 A worried Mayawati concentrated her Thakur push by fielding 36 upper caste members in the 2017 assembly elections. Her strategy, however, failed as only Uma Shankar could retain his se at. While he was re warded with BSP deputy leader's post in the UP as sembly, Jaiveer Singh was sideli ned in the party.
 
 BSP sources said Jaiveer was under pressure and lost from the   constituency in Aligarh. Jaiveer also couldn't win from Farukkhabad in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
 
 “His position in the party was shrinking, especially after Mayawati appointed Sunil Kumar Chittor, a dalit, as the party leader in the Vidhan Parishad,“ said a BSP functionary.
