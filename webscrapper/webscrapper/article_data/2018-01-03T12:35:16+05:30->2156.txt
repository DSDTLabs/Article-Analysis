CHENNAI: As many as 104   legislators met at the party headquarters in Chennai on Wednesday ahead of a session of the   assembly starting on January 8.

 The meeting was led by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam.
 
 Going by the final order of the Election Commission recognising the unified party, the EPS-OPS combine enjoys the support of 111 MLAs. Insiders say that seven MLAs, including ministers Sellur K Raju, Kadambur Raju and G Baskaran had expressed their inability to take part due to ill-health and prior engagements.
 
 The meeting assumes significance given the recent bypoll debacle in R K Nagar, where rebel leader TTV   romped to victory. 
 
 Eighteen MLAs supporting Dhinakaran have been disqualified and the action still under legal scrutiny, while two more, V T Kalaiselvan (Virudhachalam) and EA Rathinasabapathy (Aranthangi), are siding with him.
