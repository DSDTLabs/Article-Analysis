AHMEDABAD:   on Wednesday admitted one more   seeking review of the list of OBCs according to recommendations made by various  , and directions to authorities to conduct a detailed survey of communities for exclusion of upgraded communities and inclusion of those castes which require the benefits of quota policy.

 Four petitioners from Mehsana district, from where the Patidar quota stir began two years ago, filed this PIL.
 
 They demanded that the authorities should be directed to undertake exercise of periodic revision of lists of OBCs by the state and Centre with a view to excluding those classes from lists who have socially and educationally advanced by getting benefits of quota system. 
 
 This is also required to identify new backward castes for inclusion in these lists according to Section 11 of the  ,  .
 
 The PIL stated that the Supreme Court, too, had directed in 1994 that periodical review must be conducted for further inclusion, as well as exclusion of communities on OBC lists.
 
 The petitioners submitted that the reservation policy has resulted in advancement in social parameters like literacy rate, political and financial affluence, and economic growth of certain communities. Such communities no longer require benefits of reservation.
 
 The PIL has also challenged Gujarat government’s notification issued in 1994 by which it included 49 castes in its Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) category without following the procedure laid down by law. 
 
 The Act passed in 1993 mandates that inclusion of any caste or community in OBC or SEBC list will only be upon recommendation by the specific commission after conducting due surveys, but the Gujarat government’s 1994 notification had bypassed the law, stated the PIL.
