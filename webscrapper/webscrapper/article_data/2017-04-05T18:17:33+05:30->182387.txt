Last year, 
  witnessed the destruction of yet another long-standing friendship, when actress 
  and director 
  went their separate ways, but not before dissing the other in public. While one went on to write in detail about the alleged fallout in his autobiography, the other chose to stay mum and let her “Shocked!” tweet speak for itself. 

 After months of the incident coming to pass, the actress was once again asked about her side of the story, to which she politely brushed it aside saying that it was best if she stayed silent. Although she chose to keep mum on the topic,  , who is always known to speak her mind, dropped subtle hints. In an interview to a daily, she stated that a lot of people tend to misuse ‘honesty’ to “sell books, movies and ratings”.
  
 Kajol and Karan’s friendship burnt out during the box-office clash of their movies ‘
 ’ (directed by Kajol’s husband 
 ) and ‘
 ’. It was alleged that Karan paid a critic a substantial sum to lambast ‘Shivaay’ in order to get an upper hand at the ticket windows.
