Actors take on roles and are dedicated to getting under the skin of their characters. In the process, they end up putting in all that they have, and this, in turn, changes them as well. Something like this has happened with actor   Purohit, who plays the role of   in Siddharth Kumar Tewary’s 'Porus'. However, his girlfriend,  , isn’t complaining. “He is very obsessed with his character and has become a different person. He is living it, his temperament also varies at times. But I understand the pressures of working in a historical show. So, I have no problems with this,” she says, adding, “When we are chilling on the beach or in the pool or whenever I meet him, he becomes Rohit for that duration. It feels nice to see him so happy at work. All I want is for both of us to be successful as well as happy. I have no problems with him staying at Umbergaon. Distance is not an issue after five years of being together.”

 Talking about how they spend time together,   says, “I rarely visit him on the set. We share a great bond of friendship, which is what keeps our relationship alive. He is really obsessed with his character Alexander and his life revolves around it.”
 
 She adds, “We go for horse riding, sword fighting and chill on the beach. We love to watch the sunset. It’s great to spend time in Umbergaon, it’s so peaceful there.”
