KOCHI: In a surprise move, the state government has made it mandatory for postgraduate students joining self-financing medical colleges from this academic year to serve their institutions for a year as senior residents.

 “All students admitted in self-financing colleges will execute a bond to the effect that they will serve the institution for a period of one year as senior residents at the rate fixed by the government after successful completion of the postgraduate medical course,” the order issued by additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Sadanandan on May 15 reads.
 
 Director of medical education Dr   A confirmed that such an order had been issued for the first time. “We decided so because all new PG admissions in private medical colleges from this academic year will be through common counselling conducted by the commissioner of entrance examinations on the basis of the national eligibility-cum-entrance test (NEET) score. This will help them correct any deficiency in service,” she said.
 
 The PG admissions, except in government seats, were made by private colleges themselves till last year. However, neither the Indian Medical Association, Kerala, nor the Kerala Medical Post Graduates Association (KMPGA) is impressed.
