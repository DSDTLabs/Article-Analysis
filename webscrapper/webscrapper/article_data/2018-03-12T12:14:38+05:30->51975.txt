HYDERABAD:   served in the hostel mess at the   (UoH) has angered students, with many falling ill after consuming it.

 From watery dal to uncooked parathas, UoH students have complained of poor quality food being served at the hostel messes. “The dal served at the hostel mess is watery and tasteless. What’s worse, the aalu parathas served to us are never stuffed. Rather, the boiled potatoes are knead with dough and rolled. The rotis are half- cooked making them unfit for consumption,” said a student of   department.
  
  
 The messes on campus are run and supervised by students who are appointed as mess secretaries. However, concerns over poor quality food and alleged corruption in running the messes by the secretaries has forced the UoH students union to withdraw students’ participation in operating the messes.
 
 “We have repeatedly demanded the administration to put a system in place wherein the students oversee the food quality and the administration supervisors run the mess by procuring the material and monitoring/training the cooks. However, the university seems more keen on privatizing the messes than improving the existing standards,” said P Sreerag, president of UoH students union.
 
 During the students union general body meeting held in February, resolving mess food issue was on the top of list of agendas. Students claim that the restrictions imposed by the university authorities over food delivery executives within the campus is only making matters worst.
