Ludhiana: Punjab government has given its nod to open an   at Rajpura, in which training would be provided to youth for setting up their businesses in Punjab. 

 This was announced by the chairperson-cum-managing director of National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC), Ravindra Nath, on Wednesday. Nath was speaking at the inauguration of a regional office of National SC-ST Hub (NSSH) at Millerganj here. 
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Nath said Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the NSSH initiative in Ludhiana on October 18, 2016, and announced that Ludhiana, being an important economic centre, would be included in the cities where the Union ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises would set up NSSH. 
 
 Nath said Punjab had 35% SC population, and it needed to be given more opportunities. “NSSH willfulfill all requirements of SC entrepreneurs — from their preparing files, arranging meetings with banks, and ensuring easy availability of loans to start business and marketing of products, helping in organizing exhibitions in the country and foreign countries and others,” he said. 
 
 He added that the office would hold routine interactions with industry associations to understand their expectations and give them opportunities to play a larger role. “We will leave no stone unturned in creating awareness about industrial schemes, so that their benefits can be extended to maximum people,” Nath added.
 
 Earlier on Tuesday evening, NSIC CMD attended a seminar organized by Auto Parts Manufacturers Association (APMA) at a city hotel where he also launched a directory of APMA. Addressing industrialists, Nath disclosed that public sector undertakings (PSUs) had been given an annual target of 20% procurement from micro, small and medium industries, and they had to procure 4% from micro, small and medium industries, which are owned by SC-ST entrepreneurs.
