PAKDI (Jaunpur):   on Monday said PM Modi’s back-to-back rallies in Varanasi were a sign of fear and sheer desperation. “It is the ‘cycle’ (SP’s symbol) which has forced the PM to distance himself from foreign tours and even Delhi,”   said at a poll rally in Pakdi.

 Taking a jibe at Modi, Akhilesh suggested that the former swap places with him in case he was not liking his job as PM. “Pahle Pradhanmantri bahut videsh jaate thhey...ab videsh chor diya aur dilli bhi chor di, lagta hai PM ko us kursi pe maza nahi aa raha hai...aao ab adla-badli kar lete hain (Earlier, the PM used to frequently make foreign trips, now he has forgotten both foreign countries as well as Delhi. It appears that he is no more enjoying the PM’s seat in Delhi. If it seems so, he can swap places with me),” said Akhilesh.
 
 Returning Modi’s charge that Akhilesh discriminated on communal lines in supplying power to areas in the state, the CM said: “Our PM has made power a Hindu and Muslim (issue) by alleging that our government used to supply more power during Ramzan than in Diwali and Holi. Whether it is Diwali, Holi or Ramzan, we have always given enough power in every festival.”
 
 Akhilesh accused the PM of misleading farmers in the name of loan waiver and asked him “how much loan he has written off in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, where his (BJP) governments are in power”.
