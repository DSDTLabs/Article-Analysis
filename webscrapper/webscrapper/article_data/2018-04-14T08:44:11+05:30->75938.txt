HYDERABAD: Punjab’s local bodies, culture and tourism minister  , who was in Hyderabad on Friday, said from doing a study of the mining policy in many states he found   example the best.   was appointed chairman of a sub-committee on mining in Punjab and it is this assignment that brought him to Telangana.

 “The problem is not about sand mafia. It is the transport mafia that make sand smuggling possible,” Sidhu said. Observing that the Telangana government had taken measures to tackle this problem mainly through use of technology, he added, “Tabs are kept on vehicles carrying sand and their movements are monitored. This is the best thing that we can implement in Punjab.”
 
 Sidhu also said price fixation was another thing that could be emulated as online selling had made it transparent. He also said the concept of having godowns from where sand could be transported was a perfect plan being implemented in Telangana. “I am not trying to indulge in flattery. The best practices in Telangana when adopted in Punjab will plug revenue losses and fill the government coffers,” he said. He said he would suggest a mining corporation to be formed in Punjab, like the Telangana State Mineral Development Corporation.
 
 “From just Rs 10 crore in 2014, Telangana increased its revenue to Rs 1,300 crore last year. This year, it may be Rs 1,500 crore. It has got Rs 43 crore in just 11 days. This is impressive,” he said.
 
 “If Telangana, with just one and a half river can get such huge revenues, Punjab which has more should be able to get more,” he said.
