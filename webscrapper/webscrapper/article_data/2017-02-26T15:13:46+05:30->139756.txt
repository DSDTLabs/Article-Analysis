 has never shied away from showing his love for  . So was the case on Friday when  's teaser released. Unable to contain his excitement, Nithiin wrote on Twitter: 'Raayudu lu entho mandhi untaaru kaani Kaatamarayudu Okkade Untaadu #pichamass (sic)'. But that post did not go down well with  's fans, who were allegedly offended because they saw that as a veiled attack on their favourite star aka the 'Pedharayudu'. Off went a barrage of hate posts targetting Nithiin, who soon deleted the tweet and posted an apology. 'I did not want 2 hurt any 1 in the industry or out..I m extremely sorry if i hurt the feelings of fans n followers of other great artists (sic),' he wrote. And   replied, '@actor_nithiin apology accepted Tintin. Pls don't do it again'. However, Lakshmi's Tweet too soon went conspicuously missing. 
All said and done, Nithiin still posted another fanboy tweet about the teaser an hour after the altercation that says, 'KAATAMARAAYUDU!! Cant wait for the movie!! PSPK ROCKS!! #pichhamass #KatamarayuduTeaser'
