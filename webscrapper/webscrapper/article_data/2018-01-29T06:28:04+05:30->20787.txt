 The main stage drew crowds with a fusion performance of Kathakali, Kathak and contemporary dance by Sohinimoksha World Dance troupe, which was followed by zumba by Labity Sunny.
 
 The attendees, both first timers and regulars, said they had the best time at the event. “Happy Streets has been one of the best things to happen in the city. I had attended Happy Streets previously as well. It’s a unique initiative. I will definitely come to Happy Streets again,” said  , a resident of  .
 
 “This was the second time that I came to Happy Streets. We enjoyed a lot. It was a very well maintained event and we will be waiting for it to return,” said New Town resident  .
 
 First-timer Dipak Singh from Baguiati said: “It was a great event and I will be waiting for the next Happy Streets.”
 
 Then there were some who missed out on the fun. “I wanted to come to this Sunday’s Happy Streets, but couldn’t. I will have to wait for the next one instead,” said Surovi Mukherjee, a resident of   who had visited Happy Streets twice with her family this season, once in Salt Lake and once in New Town.
