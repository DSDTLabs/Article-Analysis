Nursing students hit by a speeding cab had to wait for hours before help arrived, said friends of the victims, recalling the horror that unfolded early Monday morning.

 “We were on our door-todoor inspection (in a   slum) when we got a call from one of our friends informing us about the accident. We took at least 25 minutes to reach the spot. But when we got there we were appalled to see that no one had taken the injured to the hospital,“ said Sonia C Sabu, one among the 80 to 85 fourthyear nursing students on polio immunization duty.
 
 “Left with no choice, I carried one of my friends, who was seriously injured, to the hospital in an auto-rickshaw. So did some others. Later the ambulance reached the spot and took the rest of the victims around 11:30 am,“ Sabu said.
 
 The reaction of bystanders was equally disturbing: “ A lot of people gathered at the accident spot, but none of them came forward to help our friends. They were busy taking pictures. Our injured friends were forced to wait till we reached the spot.Such inhuman behaviour in times of emergency is very disheartening,“ said nurse O J Crystal. She added that the   (PHC) at   ­ outside which they were waiting when the mishap occurred ­ remained closed till late morning. “We were supposed to wait inside the centre. Had it opened on time, this would not have happened. We wouldn't have to wait on the streets,“ said Crystal.
 
 After receiving treatment, many said they were unconscious till treatment began. “ All Iremember is sitting on a scooter and chatting with my friends. When I opened my eyes, I had a severe headache and couldn't remember anything. Our friends who brought us to the hospital are suffering from severe back and leg pains as they had to carry us to the autos that got us here,“ said a victim who was undergoing treatment at  .
