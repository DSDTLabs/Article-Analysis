Hyderabad: Following the violence that broke out at Dharna Chowk, the city police have come under criticism for their decision to allow the opposing groups to   at the venue at the same time. Some are even alleging that it was a strategic ploy to pit the warring groups against each other to add weight to the government’s stand of shifting   away from Indira Park.

 For the last few days, the Dharna Chowk Parirakshana Samithi (DCPS) has been staging protests by defying police orders. They informed the police on Monday too about a large-scale protest. At the same time, local residents and walkers’ association members also sought permission to protest from the Hyderabad police commissioner. 
 
 The police, which had been denying permissions all these days, suddenly decided on Monday morning to allow both parties to protest and offered them immunity from arrest. “For one day, it was decided to ‘permit’ protests. However, it has to be done peacefully and no one will be arrested. If anyone resorts to disturbing the tranquillity, action will be taken against them,” Hyderabad police commissioner M Mahendar Reddy told media personnel in the morning. 
 
 But things went out of hand with the two groups clashing with each other, leading the police to resort to lathicharge. 
 
 “It was unwise on the part of Hyderabad police to allow both groups to stage protest at the venue. You want to pit DCPS against locals. By showing the violence, you want to strengthen the case for not giving permissions at Indira Park. We understood your conspiracy and the people have also realised it,” TJAC chairman M Kodandaram said. 
 
 However, deputy commissioner of police (Central Zone) V Joel Davis told TOI that no one was given formal permission to stage protest. “All that we said was that for one day, peaceful protesters will not be arrested. No one was given formal permission to protest,” he said.
