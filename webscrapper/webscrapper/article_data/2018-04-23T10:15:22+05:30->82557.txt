KOCHI: The Union cabinet decision, approving the   for people convicted of raping children under 12, has opened a live debate in the state. Child rights activists are concerned as the new law has   of an under-aged child cases, which could influence the culprit to kill the child.

 They argued that in most cases, the culprit would be a relative and hence the chances of getting a statement would also be less, given the new rule. Also, activists – who are against capital punishment – have opposed the new move. Meanwhile, there is a debate in the social media with some openly supporting the death penalty.
 
 Child rights activists Subair KK said that the nearly 65% of offenders were close relatives in sexual offences against children. “I don’t think a small child would give a statement that would eventually allow the system to execute the father or a relative. This would increase the chances of such cases getting settled,” he said, adding that government should take necessary steps to ensure that chargesheet is filed on time.
 
 Meanwhile, social activist and psychologist Parvathi T said that there was a need to instil fear in the mind of the perpetrators. “A situation has arisen where children can be raped even by looking at their caste. The spike in the number of child rape cases is rampant and there is a need to instil fear in the mind of the perpetrators. Children who are raped are also killed. This needs to stop,” she said.
 
 Eminent journalist BRP Bhaskar wrote on Facebook: “Ordinancewallahs are barking up the wrong tree. Death penalty hasn't reduced rate of any crime. It is revenge, not punishment (sic),” he wrote.
 
 Fr Thomas PD, director of Childline in Thiruvananthapuram raised apprehension over the ordinance choosing a specific age (12) when the actual age of children protected under Pocso Act is 18.
