SHIMLA: Severe discrepancies in the voters list could delay elections to the Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC). As per reports, names of more than 400 Gram Panchayat residents, 1,000 dead people and those who left Shimla years ago have allegedly been included in the new Electoral Roll. The polling date was supposed to be announced on May 8. And as per rules elections have to be conducted before June 5. 

  The Shimla District Administration finalised the voters list on May 4 and it included around 88,000 voters, but even after rectification, the latest list is full of errors. 
 
 Shimla Deputy Mayor Tikender Singh Panwar is totally in the dark. He said the corrected new voters list has glaring anomalies including criss crossing of voters, exclusion of more than 30,000 people, to mention a few. What is noteworthy is the inclusion of voters who are no longer alive including Kuldeep Chand and   who died 10 years ago. Ajay   who shifted to Chandigarh 10 years ago is also included in the voters list from Totu. "It is in this background that fresh revision of electoral rolls is demanded," he added.
 
  ward councillor Surinder Chauhan added that more than 20 deceased voters have been included in his ward's voters list. He said, this could have have been avoided if the list had been prepared 6 months back. Benmore Ward (BJP) councillor   said that around 30 people in the   area have been shifted to Benmore ward. 
 
 Ruldu Bhatta ward (BJP) councillor Saroj Thakur said without any residential proof, many labourers from outside Shimla have been included in the voters list. But Shimla deputy commissioner   said the electoral rolls are never hundred per cent correct and there is always a possibility of mistakes. "The electoral roll can still be corrected and people can approach us. To my knowledge, the election date is not finalised yet," he added.
