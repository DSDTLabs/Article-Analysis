THANE: Two   have been arrested for allegedly trying to   Rs 5 lakh from a   political leader after they jotted down his phone number displayed on a hoarding in Raigad district.

 The accused, Vangani’s Sushant Telange and Nagthane’s Subham Gole, both aged 19, are unemployed. 
 
 On April 16, the  , a Thane resident, got a WhatsApp message from an unknown “person” claiming to have been in a relationship with his daughter before her marriage four months ago. The man claimed to be depressed and said he had spent Rs 5 lakh on dates with the neta’s daughter. He also claimed to have video clips of their “private moments” and threatened to post them online unless he was “repaid” the sum spent on the dates. 
 
 “The complainant received several WhatsApp messages from the number between April 16 and April 21,” said senior inspector Pradeep Sharma. The neta approached the anti-extortion cell, which, in turn, formed a special squad with sub-inspectors Sandesh Gavand and Avinash Mahajan, and constables Suresh More, Prashant Bhurke, Suhas Khatate, Samir Laate and Umesh Jadhav. Technical analysis revealed that the accused had sent the WhatsApp messages without a SIM card, said police inspector R V Kothmire.
 
 The duo sent the neta a photograph of a signboard near Vakangaon and asked him to keep the money under it on April 21. However, the police team reached the spot along with the complainant and placed a bag filled with papers.
 
 When the duo reached the spot to pick up the bag around 8pm that evening, waiting cops pinned them down.
 
 The duo confessed to the crime and the probe showed that they knew nothing about the neta’s daughter. They had previously tried to con a doctor with a similar ploy but he had ignored them as he had an only son and no daughter.
