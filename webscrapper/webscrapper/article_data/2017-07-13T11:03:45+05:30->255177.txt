YAVATMAL:   chief Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday stayed the decision by minister of state (MoS) for revenue   to replace partyâ€™s district chiefs at   and Washim. 

 Rathod had reportedly taken the decision without consulting Lok Sabha member Bhavana Gawali, who took the neglect seriously and conveyed her grievance to the party chief. Taking cognisance of her complaint, Thackeray stayed the appointments with immediate effect.
 
 Sanjay Rathod had replaced Santhosh Dhawale in Yavatmal by appointing his close associate Parag Pingle. In Washim, he appointed   of Mangrulpir as district chief.
 
 Rumours are rife in Shiv Sena camp that Rathod is eyeing candidature for Lok Sabha election due in 2019 from Yavatmal-Washim constituency in place of four-time MP Gawali. The change in district chiefs and other office-bearers in the party is a pre-planned exercise by Rathod to meet his political ambition, said sources in the party.
