'M80 Moosa' fame Surabhi Lakshmi became a household name after she recently won the Best Actress Award at the National Film Awards 2017. 

 It's for her role in the film 'Minnaminungu' that the dancer-cum-theater artiste won the accolade. Directed by Anil Thomas, the film has her playing the role of a 45-year-old mom from Trivandrum, who is bogged down by the various issues in her life. The trailer of the movie is just out on social media and it primarily features the performance of Surabhi, who has also done many character roles in Malayalam.
 
 Actors Prem Prakash and Rebecca Santhosh also play important roles in 'Minnaminungu.'
