Madurai: Outpatient services are likely to be partially hit at government and private hospitals in Madurai and southern districts, with doctors set to strike over National Medical Commission Bill tabled in parliament, on Tuesday.

 Tamil Nadu Government Doctors’ Association (TNGDA) and Indian Medical Association (IMA) called the protest against the bill allowing ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy practitioners to practice modern medicines on completion of short term course called ‘bridge’.
 
 While the doctors at the government medical college and district headquarters hospitals to stay away from consulting outpatients from 9.30 am to 10.30 am, the private medical practitioners would not allow any outpatient appointment between 6 am to 6 pm. 
 
 Discontent over the bill, allopathic practitioners have been vehemently opposing the Centre’s move for the past few days and even have announced a statewide protest in Tamil Nadu.
 
 TNGDA members would stage a dharna in front of Government Rajaji Hospital for an hour wearing a black badge. The biggest government hospital in the state, Rajaji Hospital has 500 doctors working there and gets on average 8,000 to 10, 000 outpatients every day.
 
 “There is no need for a new commission and Medical Council of India which regulates medical education should be continued. If there is some problem with the body, it should addressed. If anyone has committed mistake, they can be punished. But the body should not be replaced with Naional Medical Commission as it will affect the quality of treatment provided to the people,” said Dr Alaga Venkatesan, vice-president of Madurai chapter of IMA.
 
 The treatment for the in-patients would not be affected in any hospitals.
