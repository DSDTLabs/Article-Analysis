BENGALURU: Two years after he lost his wife  , who was stabbed in a Metro station in Sydney,   said he and his 12-year-old daughter go through living hell every day in Bengaluru.

 “I’m already suffering after my wife’s death. What makes my sorrow unbearable are unconfirmed media reports. It’s very difficult to live this painful life. For those suspecting my family members of murder, I say ‘Be in the state I am in and you will understand’. I have a 12-year-old daughter, lost my wife, have been facing investigation and, above all, suspicious eyes and ears always treat me differently,” Arun Kumar told STOI.
 
 Reacting to media reports close family members of Prabha transferring part of the compensation, given by the Australian government, to a woman in Sri Lanka, Arun Kumar said, “I deny the allegations. These are baseless.”
 
 Arun says he’s more worried for his daughter. “She is 12 years old now; I’ve to plan for her future. I have to make sure her mind won’t be affected by these controversies,” he said.
 
 Arun is cooperating with the  . “It’s in their hands. Let’s wait and see. I request the media and society not to jump to conclusions. Don’t make judgements. For you, it’s a story. For my daughter and me, it’s our lives” he said.
 
 His entire family is waiting for justice. “At times, I feel the killer should have killed us too so that we would not have faced such humiliation from the society and the media,” he said.
 
 Prabha, a software engineer with MindTree, was on her way home after meeting a client on March 7, 2015. She was speaking to Arun on the phone when she was attacked in Parramatta Park, Sydney, around 9pm. She was critically injured and died later. Her valuables -- handbag, wallet, mobile and gold chain -- were found intact, hinting that robbery may not have been the motive for the crime.
