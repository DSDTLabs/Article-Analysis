 The RPF squad, under senior divisional security commissioner Jyoti Kumar Satija, has been conducting regular drives in trains to tackle illegal ferrying of liquor, contraband and other substances. After the successful crackdown on ganja coming from Vishakhapatnam, the RPF is now targeting illegal smuggling of liquor.
 
 The RPF team comprising constable Vikas Sharma and others under inspector Virendra Wankhede also tried to net the culprit who was carrying the consignment but no one came forward to claim the bag. Liquor consignments are mostly smuggled to Chandrapur district, where liquor is banned.
