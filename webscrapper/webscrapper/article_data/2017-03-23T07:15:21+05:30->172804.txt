ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's exChief Justice   and his son faced humiliation at   airport after being told by one of the passengers to stand passengers to stand at the back of the queue. In the video, which has gone viral, Chaudhry's son can be seen arguing with a passenger asking him to go at the back of the line as people queued up to board a plane to London at  . The video shows both father and son out of the queue, when a man shouts, “You're not in the queue, you're pushing in.

 Upon this, the chief justice's son, Arslan Iftikhar, tries to justify his action saying they are travelling in business class. “Business class passengers were asked to come to the front of queue,“ Arslan, who is said to have misused his father's position when he was in power, said. “No, he told you to go back,“ the man replied, hin ting towards an air ting towards an air port official. “No he doesn't know anyt hing, I came from the counter,“ Arslan re plied. “Talk to those at the counter but don't push in the queue. We have been waiting,“ the man said. Amid the heated debate, Iftikhar Chaudhry intervened, saying it “doesn't matter“ as he walked out of the frame in video, perhaps to the end of the queue. “Arslan thought this was a Pakistani airport and he could just barge into the line and cut it,“ read one of the comments on video.
