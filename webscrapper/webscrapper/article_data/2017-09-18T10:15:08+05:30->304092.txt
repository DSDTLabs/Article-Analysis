RANCHI: In the previous encounter of these two teams in the Pro-Kabaddi League Season 5,   had emerged victorious in Hyderabad. On a warm Sunday evening here under lights at the Harivansh Tana Bhagat Indoor Stadium,   avenged that loss, thrashing Delhi by 11 points.

 In a game played later in the evening, Bengal Warriors held hosts   to a 37-37 tie.
 
 Both Delhi and Jaipur chose to start on a cautious note before Delhi's Rohit Baliyan fell prey to the Panthers defence. While Abolfazl Maghsodlou brought Delhi back to level, the Iranian raider was soon sent packing by Panthers' Siddharth.
 
 Pawan Kumar got into the act for the former champions, prising out Satpal and Viraj Vishnu Landge with his first raid of the evening. Having done little of note till then, Panthers skipper Manjeet Chhillar further dented Delhi's hopes by taking out Baliyan with an audacious tackle.
 
 
 
 Trailing by nine points (18-9) at half time, the Meraj Sheykh-led Delhi side could put up little resistance as Rawal ran riot. The Delhi defenders had no answer to Rawal's raiding as the ignominy of a second all-out loomed large minutes after the restart. Down to two men, R Sriram returned an empty raid before Rawal caught Delhi's Sunil with a superb tackle. The in-form raider then completed the formalities by sending R Sriram out of the mat as the Panthers gained a 12-point (24-12) advantage over their hapless opposition.
 
 Delhi did put up a fight in the last ten minutes of the encounter with Maghsodlou claiming two raid points and the defenders coordinating well to send Pawan Kumar back. But it was never going to be enough.
