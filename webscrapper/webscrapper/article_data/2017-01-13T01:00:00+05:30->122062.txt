 Their music, a blend of blues, rock and psychedelic, is accompanied by heavy-duty Urdu and Kashmiri lyrics. While this fusion was organic, audiences, too has welcomed this. “There have been instances of people singing along even without knowing the exact meaning of the songs. It’s the sound — a mix of soulful blues and atmospheric sounds — which lures them. We don’t particularly like to fit in a bracket,” shares Khalid, who also pens the lyrics along with Kashif. Occasionally, like in case of their EP ‘Behosh’ and LP ‘Baran’, some lyrics were also contributed by their friend Umar Allaie. In addition, some previously existing poems by writers like Allama Iqbal and Ghulam Ahmed Mehjoor are also part of their lyrics.
