Mysuru: Against a backdrop of the many allegations being made about the administration of prisons in the state, the arrest of a habitual offender, who was released on   from Hindalga Jail in Belagavi, on charges of   has raised eyebrows.

 Kaleem, 35, was arrested by officials from the Mysuru City Crime Branch recently. Interestingly, Kaleem was released on parole although he was still under trial for a murder case at a Bengaluru court. A public prosecutor told TOI that an inmate can be released on parole after serving one year in jail. “It could be on account of a serious illness or if there is a death in the family. Release of a prisoner on parole is decided by senior   officials within a division. However, releasing a habitual offender on parole calls for a probe,” he added.
 
 A resident of Gurappana Palya on Bannerghatta Road in Bengaluru, Kaleem was released on a one-month parole on May 30. However, when he was out on parole, Kaleem allegedly conspired with seven others to rob the Kyathi Steel Private Ltd office on June 23. The gang made away with Rs 29 lakh, and allegedly assaulted the manager. Cops have also arrested the seven other members of the gang. 
 
 Mysuru city police commissioner AS Rao on Tuesday said, “Kaleem was the brain behind the operation.”
 
 Kaleem has now returned to Hindalga jail in Belagavi.
