Pune: Sanjay Shitole compelled the driver of a   bus to visit a police chowkey in Katraj after a sharp steel plate jutting out of a seat of the vehicle caused a cut on his   on Wednesday afternoon.

 At the police chowkey, Shitole lodged a non-cognizable offence against the PMPML administration for the incident.
 
 Senior inspector Kamlakar Takawale of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police told TOI that Shitole, a resident of Katraj, said the tear on his trousers resulted due to the ill-maintenance of PMPML buses.
 
 The incident occurred when the bus was heading towards Jambhulwadi from Shivajinagar. Shitole boarded the bus at Bibvewadi bus stop and was to alight from it at Katraj junction. However, while getting up, his trousers got caught in the sharp edges of the rod located beneath the seat he was seated on. “The trousers tore down as he got up”, Takawale said.
 
 Takawale said Shitole claimed that the trousers were worth Rs 1,000. PMPML officials said it is duty of the PMPML to provide quality services to its passengers. “If such an incident has taken place, it needs to be dealt with utter seriousness. We will ask the departments concern to look into the case,” they said.
