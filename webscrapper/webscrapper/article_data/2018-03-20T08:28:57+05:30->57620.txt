HYDERABAD: In a latest development, the Centre has instructed all states and Union territories to ensure that patients receive   absolutely 'free of cost' without having to bear the cost for processing. Blood banks in the public sector have been collecting between 50 to 1,050 per unit of blood as 'processing charges' that are collected for separation of blood components, a process called platelet apheresis and storage of blood. 

 These charges not only add to the out-of-pocket expenditure of patients, but also discourage voluntary donation. "While the requirement for whole blood and blood components is constantly rising, there is no commensurate increase in blood supply. More pertinently, while public health facilities in the state do not charge any cost for blood, they are collecting processing charge at varying rates. These processing charges discourage voluntary donation as there is a misconception that blood banks are collecting charges on blood donated free of cost," states the order received by the Telangana health department.
 
 Stressing that access to adequate and safe supply of blood and blood components is critical for enabling a wide range of critical care procedures, the directive issued by the additional secretary and mission director, NHM, Manoj Jhalani, said the   (NHM) has been providing support to strengthen blood supply for blood banks, blood storage units and blood component separation units.
