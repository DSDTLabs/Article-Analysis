NEW DELHI: A day after LG Anil   approved a   to compensate consumers for unscheduled power cuts, Delhi government moved to provide more clarity on how they would be paid. While the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission already has a penalty clause in the Delhi Electricity Code and Performance Standard Regulations, the government stated in the policy that “it will supersede existing provisions and new provisions will directly benefit a majority of consumers who are affected due to frequent power cuts in different parts of Delhi”.

 This is the second time AAP government has tried to implement the compensation policy. In 2016, a similar proposal was rejected as the government hadn’t take prior approval from LG. “In case of an unscheduled power  , except in force majeure conditions, the supply will be restored within an hour. Failure to do so will result in a penalty of Rs50 per hour per consumer for the first two hours, followed by Rs100 per hour per consumer after two hours for each hour of default beyond the specified one hour, including Rs50 per hour   earlier. Exemption of one hour from penal provisions is granted only once during the entire day. In case of recurrence of failure of supply for the same consumer on same day, the penalty will commence right from the beginning of the unscheduled power cut. There will be no exemption for any duration for restoration of repeated failure of supply (sic),” the policy states.
 
 The government has also elaborated on payment process. The individual complainant will be assigned a unique serial number. The discom complaint centre will attend to the “no current” complaint and, once power supply is restored, send a confirmation message to the consumer with restoration date and time. If and when the time taken to restore power is above the permissible limit, the compensation amount will be credited to the consumer’s CA number without manual intervention.
