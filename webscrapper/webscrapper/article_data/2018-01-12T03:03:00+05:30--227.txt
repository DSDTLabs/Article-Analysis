Who doesn't like the idea of youthful and glowing skin? Let's face it, every girl loves the idea of bright skin. In the quest for glowing skin, we girls have done everything from face masks to serum, but getting that glow is a tricky one. In between working schedules and busy lifestyle, our skin tends to take a toll.

  To combat dull skin, you need to follow a few tips and a proper skin care. But, if you're looking for a quick fix, then rely on a highlighter. A highlighter will lend a glow to your skin and instantly make your skin look more alive. With a few tricks and learning where to apply this genius product, you can make your skin glow in seconds.
 
 Follow these easy steps and get your shine on:
 
 
 
 Dry skin can collect on the make-up product and the shimmer patches can create a faux pas. Always moisturise your skin, so the highlighter glides perfectly on your skin.
 
 
 
 The right texture of the product can make a lot of difference. If you have dry skin, you can try a strobing cream and a cream based highlighter. And powder-based products can go well with oily skin type.

 You don't have to go overboard with this trend. To get that glow you need to apply highlighter where your skin reflects the light most. Apply it on the bridge or your nose, on your cheekbones, brow bones, forehead and above the cupid's bow. Once, you've applied the product, blend it well with a brush.
