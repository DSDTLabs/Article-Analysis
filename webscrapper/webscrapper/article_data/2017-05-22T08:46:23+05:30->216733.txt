AGARTALA:   reiterated that the process of   in the coming   against the   has been progressing well. 

 At a party convention at Dharmanagar in North Tripura on Saturday, TMC state president Ashis Saha and MLA Sudip Roy Barman took stock of five assembly constituencies of the district and asserted that a Left Front government will not form this time. 
 
 On the statements made by BJP leaders against Roy Barman, including president Biplab Kumar Deb and observer Sunil Deodhar, the MLA said, "We believe the comments against Trinamool party and its leader in Tripura by BJP leaders were not the view of the party. Comments against any opposition leader in such a crucial time is nothing but detrimental for themselves. BJP central leaders seem to be serious about bringing an end to the 25-year Left rule."
 
 He advised his workers to strengthen the party base and campaign against Left misrule, adding, "No matter who instigates or attempts to divert the movement, we shall not derail from our target to dislodge the Left Front government in a democratic manner. Our effort is to prevent division of votes and unite all oppositions."
 
 TMC has started activities at the district level with a 11-point demand against the state government, including high incidence of crime against women, massive misappropriation of development fund from the Centre and high rate of unemployment. "We know these are the issues where public sentiment is against the government and people are convinced that leftists will not solve the problem because of their administrative incompetency, misrule, nepotism and conservative ideas," added TMC president Ashis Saha.
