 Having learnt about the struggle faced by Loyangamba in pursuing his education, CM Biren Singh travelled to his house at Keibi Khullem Makha Leikai in Imphal East and provided aid in both cash and kind as a token of encouragement to pursue his education and career. The CM handed over Rs 50,000 to the student from his discretionary fund, for the purpose of enrolling in college and procuring books and stationery. The CM further promised to arrange a bank loan of Rs 2 lakhs so that Loyangamba may give up construction work, apart from a grant of Rs 1.2 lakh under the government's housing scheme. The assistance was given because Loyangamba got a top rank despite being from a needy family, said Biren.
