NEW DELHI: The CBI action against RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his family members on Friday has further strengthened the  's (ED) ongoing investigation against the former Bihar chief minister, whose family members are already facing ED probe under the stringent Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). 

 Besides Lalu, the CBI case mentioned his wife   and son Tejashwi. The CBI FIR can serve as ground for the ED to register a PMLA case against Lalu and his wife along with their son who is deputy CM of Bihar. The other accused in the CBI case include former managing director of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation P K Goyal and Sujata, the wife of Lalu's confidant and former Union minister Prem Chand Gupta.
 
 In May, the ED had arrested a Delhi-based chartered accountant who had allegedly provided "accommodation entries" to Lalu's daughter Misa Bharti and her husband Shailesh. The CA was believed to have been behind cash transactions linked to some shell companies that owned benami properties in posh Delhi localities. The benami properties are under investigation by the ED and the income tax department. The I-T department has also attached some of these properties, including land in Patna, claiming that Lalu's family members were beneficiaries of these properties. 
 
 "CA Rajesh Agrawal has been associated with transactions involving Mishail Packers and Printers Pvt Ltd which owns a farmhouse in Palam Vihar," the ED had said. A senior officer said Misha and her husband were the alleged beneficiaries of the property. The ED had seized documents from the CA which allegedly substantiated cash transactions of Rs 39 crore which was allegedly layered through several shell companies in 2009-10.
