BENGALURU: Visitors at   will get a glimpse of bygone Bengaluru this weekend, with police set to deploy four   on  . The cops will be stationed inside the park as vehicle entry is not permitted on weekends.

 More than being an attraction, the horsemen will perform core policing duties, said police commissioner Praveen Sood. Horses are good for crowd control and apart from Cubbon Park, they will be deployed on   and Commercial Street too.
 
 This is not a newly raised unit. Bengaluru police has had a stable of five horses for a long time, but they have been used only for ceremonial purposes. “We thought these horses could be used for policing as well, especially for crowd control. So we will deploy them at places which see high footfalls — two days in Cubbon Park and one day each at Brigade Road and Commercial Street,” he said.
 
 D Kishore Babu, deputy commissioner of police, City Armed Reserve headquarters, said patrolling is not new to these horses. Apart from taking part in parades, they have been patrolling in Cubbon Park for some time. He said the riders will be given reflective jackets for smooth movement of the horses through traffic at Commercial Street and Brigade Road. 
 
 The horses will be transported from the CAR facility to the patrolling location in a special vehicle. Although CAR has five horses in its stable, only four are being used for patrolling as one is old. Cops are planning to take the total number of horses in city police to 11.
 
 Vigilance begins at Commercial Street
 
 The deployment of the horses at Commercial Street on Thursday raised curiosity. While many children were scared, some came forward to pat them. “I have seen   only in movies. Seeing them in real life exciting,” said Roshini Mohan, a student from Jain College.
