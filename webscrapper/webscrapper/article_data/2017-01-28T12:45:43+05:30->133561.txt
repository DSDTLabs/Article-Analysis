HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh   (CRDA) has quietly invited   under the   to select the master developer for the 6.84 sq km start-up area in the upcoming capital city of Amaravati.

 The CRDA has issued a notifi cation asking interested companies to submit counter proposals to the original project proponent (OPP) Ascendas-Singbridge Private Limited and Sembcorp Development Limited. The notification has been issued under the   Infrastructure Development Enabling Act, 2001.
 
 Making a curious change in the process, the CRDA has said that details of revenue sharing proposed by the OPP will be revealed only in the second stage.
 
 The counter proposal process involves two stages. The first stage involves qualification of bidders who send an application in accordance with the provisions of the Request for Qualification (RFQ) document. Those who qualify in this stage are eligible to participate in the second stage of the bidding process, where the RFQ document and revenue share proposals offered by the OPP is made available to the qualified bidders.
 
 Unlike the first time, the CRDA underplayed the notification process in view of the criticism and court cases that it attracted earlier. CRDA has decided Feb 21 as the deadline for the submission of RFQ documents.
 
 Sources said that not many companies are expected to submit counter proposals this time.CRDA had earlier claimed that many firms in China and Japan will be keen to participate, but only half a dozen companies had turned up. “This time, the Singapore companies may not have much competition,“ the sources said.
