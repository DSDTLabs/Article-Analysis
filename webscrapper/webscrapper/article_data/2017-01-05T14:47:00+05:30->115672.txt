NAGPUR:   at the   at   are struggling to make a sale even by midday, and blame demonetisation for the dismal situation.

 The dismal state of   systems is driving customers away from purchasing handicraft items ranging from carpets to novelty items.
 
 The fair has been organized by the  , under the aegis of office of the development commissioner (handicrafts), ministry of textiles, government of India.
 
 Officials from the board present here have managed to get a micro-ATM system sponsored by the Punjab National Bank, Nagpur division, for customers willing to withdraw cash and buy handicraft. Abhishek Soni, an official from the board, said the micro-ATM has been commissioned even though artisans have the facility of Unified Payment Interface ( ) and *99# USSD code payment methods commissioned by the centre.
 
 There are problems since many artisans are either not adept with the new payment systems or the interface does not respond due to mobile network glitches, said Soni.
 
 The withdrawal limit at the ATM here is the same as a normal ATM, Rs4,500. However, this cannot cover the cost of all the items on sale at the expo. 
 
 Javed Sheikh, an artisan selling handmade rugs at the fair, says prices of his products range from Rs2,500 to Rs35,000.
 
 Although the micro-ATM facility is available, there is a need for a point of sale (POS) machine for people to make payments for more expensive items, said Sheikh.
 
 Even at 2pm, Sheikh had not made a single sale. On the flip side, Sudha Dhote, owner of a micro enterprise manufacturing packaged food items, was running a busy stall at the fair.
 
 Dhote claims she is unaffected by the cash crunch and is seeing steady sales. She manages to convince customers turning up with Rs2,000 notes to buy at least Rs500 worth of her products before giving them change.
