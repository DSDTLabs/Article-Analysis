Mumbai: Municipal commissioner   has issued an order that 49   employed in   be paid on a par with other civic staff. 

 This is the third order that Mehta has issued for the benefit of these men who joined BMC after serving in defence forces for 15 years. The former defence personnel, mostly employed as security guards in BMC, have been fighting for their rights for 10 years. 
 
 After taking charge as BMC chief in 2015, Mehta had heard the grievances of ex-defence personal and asked his juniors to ensure they get the pay according to rules. But officials did not pay any attention to the matter, which forced Mehta to issue a second order last year. However, the civic administration said the revised salary would be applicable since year 2012, and not 2006 as mentioned in the rules.
 
 Subsequently, the retired defence personnel again approached Mehta. Subsequently, he issued a third order a fortnight ago, asking his juniors to consider the ex-servicemen’s previous experience to increase their salary as per the rules.
 
 “Some civic officials don’t like us, so they are not implementing the order and delaying it. We fight for the country and as per the government rule, need to be provided a job after retirement from the forces. But we are getting poor treatment in BMC,” said one of the security guards.
