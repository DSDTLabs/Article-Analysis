PURULIA:   have long been the preserve of   but now  , the   (OC) of  , slain by Maoists in 2003, will join the ranks of Gandhiji, Nehru and others with a statue of him in the compound of the station he bravely headed. 

 The 2.6 feet high marble statue has been built at a cost of Rs 2.5 lakh by sculptors at Bankura's Susunia.
 
 Present Bandwan OC Rana Bhagat Saha said, "Ever since I took charge, the idea of installing the statue of Das donned on me. Das became a martyr for the cause of maintaining peace in the face of the PWG's guerrilla movement. It is in honour of this martyr that a smriti udyan is being built in his honour within the police station's compound."
 
 Das died on October 11, 2003 while fighting People's War Group (PWG) guerrillas on a road between Katagora and Madhuban forests in Bandwan. On being tipped off about a meeting between villagers and PWG leaders, Das rushed in his car without other policemen. While on his way, a landmine blasted and his vehicle overturned. 
 
 Das, however, managed to get out of the car and lift his weapon, but PWG men were already hiding in in the forest. They shot him several times, killing him instantly. 
 
 His death marked the first major strike of the PWG, which combined with the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC) almost a year later on September 21, 2004 to form the CPI (Maoists). Then began a spree of Maoist killings throughout Jangalmahal for years. 
 
 Besides being the local OC, Das was also from the Bandwan's Nanna village. After he was killed, Das's widow Basanti and both their sons Monoj and Swapan moved to Purulia town. 
 
  "Work on the project is almost complete. The udyan will be inaugurated soon," Purulia SP Joy Biswas said.
