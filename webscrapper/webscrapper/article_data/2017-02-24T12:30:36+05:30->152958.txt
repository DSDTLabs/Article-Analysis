NAGPUR: Even though BJP has done exceedingly well in 2017 Nagpur   ( ) elections, its   have not done very well. Only one of the four tasted victory. The performance of the other three was not very satisfying.

 This time BJP had fielded three Muslim candidates against non-Muslim candidates of Congress. This formula worked only in one case. From Seat 3D Naseem Bano Khan won against an independent candidate Surekha Talwekar. Sunita Dhole of   came third.
 
 Rabia Qureshi, who was contesting against Kunda Khobragade of Congress and Vaishali Narnawre of BSP from Seat 6C came third. The BSP candidate defeated both Congress and BJP. Mohammed Farooq Sheikh of BJP was pitted against Arvindarpal Singh ‘Babbi’ Bawa of Congress from Seat 9D. However, both lost to Narendra Walde of BSP. Sheikh, however, was the runner-up. BJP’s Muslim face in the 2012-17 regime-- Jaitunbi Ashfaque-- lost by a margin of 9,500 votes to Zulfiqar Bhutto of Congress from from Seat 8B.
 
 Congress’ decision to field a non-Muslim from 3D also backfired. However, this happened by accident. Shazia Ansari had sought ticket from Seat 3D. As she has three children, the party leaders felt her nomination might be rejected. Sunita Dhole also sought a ticket and was given a B form. Ansari later got an order from court okaying her candidature but Dhole had filed her papers by then and hence became the party’s official candidate.
 
 Commenting on the performance of its Muslim candidates, a BJP leader said they may have lost but Muslims voted for BJP because of secular image of Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. “Even though they have RSS background, both have never taken an anti-minority stand and hence Muslims feel safe,” he added.
