JAIPUR: The latest incident of a 22-year-old   in Jaipur by an auto-rickshaw driver and three others has raised concerned about the verification of auto drivers in the city, several of whom are out of the database of law enforcement agencies.

 According to sources, there are about 25,000 auto drivers in the city. Many of whom are not registered drivers. “We have the database of the registered auto drivers, but many of them don’t drive these autos themselves. Instead they lease out their three wheelers to others. These ‘dummy drivers’ create law and order challenges as we have no way to trace them,” cops said.
 
 In June 2016, a similar rape case was reported where an auto driver had raped a minor girl in   area; the subsequent investigation revealed that the accused had taken the auto on lease. Since then, city police started the process of verification of autos in the city, but the project ran into rough weathers due to operations problems. 
 
 “The verification task is arduous as these drivers drift from one city to another. And with no permanent address, they can easily slip away after committing a crime,” said police commissioner Sanjay Agarwal who himself led the investigation in Transport Nagar rape case.
 
 The senior cops said that for many of the unemployed youth, auto driving is a seasonal employment. “If the owner of an auto has to go out of city to attend a wedding, he would lease his taxi to a boy and informed taxi stand to keep a watch over him. These second hand drivers molest passengers, charge exorbitant fares and slip away after committing a crime,” cops said.
 
 The traffic police in several cases have found that auto drivers don’t wear the mandated uniform, “We have seen auto owners giving their blue shirts to some other driver so that they could driver auto on their behalf, in fact many registered auto drivers are no longer drive autos, they do other business and lease out their three wheelers,” a senior traffic cops told TOI.
