NAGPUR: In a jolt to the beleaguered city Congress, one of the 29 corporators has resigned even before taking oath. Gargi Chopra, was elected by a margin of 4,486 votes from seat 10D. She has sent her resignation to municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar, outgoing mayor   and city Congress president Vikas Thakre by registered post.

 A source in   (NMC) said that as the resignation had been sent by registered post, the municipal commissioner had no option but to accept it. “A by-election will be held soon for her seat. The date will be decided by the State Election Commission (SEC),” he added.
 
 Chopra told TOI that she had resigned due to personal reasons. Her resignation letter also states the same without any elaboration. A source in Congress said that a Congress activist had accused her of not campaigning for the three other candidates of four member panel in ward 10. He had verbally abused her, which disgusted her and she decided to resign.
 
 Chopra had polled 10,981 votes while other three candidates had got far lesser — Sakshi Raut (9,456),   (9,577) and   (9,084).   had won by a margin of only 68 votes. The reason for the narrow margin was NCP candidate Ramesh Ghatole who polled 4,021 votes.
 
 Chopra’s husband Prashant is a three-time Congress corporator. Gargi had contested this time as there was no open seat in the ward. 
 
 Both Hardikar and Thakre were in Mumbai and could not be contacted. Datke told TOI that he had heard about Chopra’s resignation but was yet to receive the registered letter. “It is up to the municipal commissioner to take an appropriate decision,” he said.
