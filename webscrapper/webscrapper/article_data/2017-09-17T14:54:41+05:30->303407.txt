Security concerns in St Louis,  , have forced U2 to cancel their concert at The Dome at America's Center. The   Police Department would not have sufficient personnel to monitor the concert while unrest in downtown St Louis continues after the not-guilty verdict for ex-police officer Jason Stockley, who was accused of the murder of Anthony Lamar Smith.

  
  
 The concert was cancelled because the band said it could not risk its fans' safety. "As much as we regret having to cancel, we feel it is the only acceptable course of action in the current environment," U2 said in a statement. 
 
 The band's frontman, Bono, said he is "deeply saddened at what has happened in St Louis and having to cancel our show..." Bono wrote that he asked himself whether this is 1968 or 2017, and quoted the words of Dr   King, "Human progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability... We are coming to ask America to be true to the huge promissory note that it signed years ago."
 
 "And we are coming to engage in dramatic nonviolent action, to call attention to the gulf between promise and fulfillment; to make the invisible visible."
