NEW DELHI: On a day when Bengal Congress chief Adhir Chowdhury knocked the doors of the Calcutta HC accusing the ruling TMC of terrorising opposition candidates for panchayat polls, another party leader and senior advocate   on Friday defended the state in the SC, which was hearing a petition by BJP against the TMC government on the same issue. 

 As the last date for filing of nomination paper is April 9, BJP’s Bengal unit rushed to the SC accusing TMC workers and state EC officials of colluding to prevent its candidates from contesting. Appearing before a bench of Justices R K Agrawal and A M Sapre, senior advocate   alleged that democracy is being murdered in the state and BJP workers are being killed. “In addition, the ruling party has unleashed violence against candidates of BJP, who along with family members are being threatened and dissuaded from contesting,” the party said in its petition.
 
 Elections for 42,000 seats are scheduled for May 1, 3 and 5, with counting on May 8. Countering BJP’s submission, Singhvi, recently elected to Rajya Sabha from Bengal with TMC’s support, said there were areas in the state where nominations filed by BJP workers outnumbered those by TMC’s and pleaded the SC to reject the petition. 
 
 Interestingly, Singhvi said a similar petition had been filed in Calcutta HC which refused to pass any interim order and posted the case for April 20. He was referring to Chowdhury’s plea seeking direction to the state EC to ensure free and fair polls. ASG Tushar Mehta said the Centre was ready to deploy sufficient paramilitary forces for free and fair polls. The bench said it would pass judgment on April 9.
