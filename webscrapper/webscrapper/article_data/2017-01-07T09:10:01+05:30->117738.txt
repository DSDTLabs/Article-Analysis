NAGPUR:   received another boost ahead of   (NMC) elections on Friday when two more sitting corporators joined the party in presence of Ashok Chavan, president of   (MPCC) and city Congress President Vikas Thakre. The total tally of sitting corporators joining Congress has now reached seven.

 One of them is a   corporator   while the other is Shravan Khapekar from MNS. Punekar is the corporator from Jagnath Budhwari ward while Khapekar represents Naik Talao. 
 
 Earlier, two sitting corporators Sheetal Gharat of   and Bhavna Dhakne of BRP-BMS had joined the party on December 29. During the winter session of state legislature, three sitting corporators had jumped on to the Congress bandwagon. They included Kishor Gajbhiye of BSP and independents Kishor Dorle and Kavita Sangole. 
 
 Gharat is a big catch as she was the party leader of Sena in NMC. Dorle and Sangole were members of the NMC standing committee in the BJP regime. Significantly, three of the five corporators (except Gajbhiye and Gharat) were members of Nagpur Vikas Aghadi (NVA), the BJP-led alliance that is ruling the NMC.
 
 Meanwhile, rumours are rife in political circles that a sitting NCP corporator will join either BJP or Congress. The development is likely to take place in couple of days.
