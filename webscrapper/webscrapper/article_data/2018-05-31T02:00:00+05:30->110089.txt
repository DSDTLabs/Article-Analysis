 Each battery-operated golf cart would have the seating capacity for 12 to 15 persons. As per zoo officials, these carts would provide visitors transportation facilities from gate number one to gate number two.
 
 “The bidding process has already been completed. The contract for supplying the carts is likely to be awarded within a fortnight,” zoo director Kamal Singh said.
 
 Four battery-operated golf carts with each having the seating capacity for 12 persons are already serving the visitors at the zoo. A person has to spend Rs30 while one has to pay Rs300 for the entire cart. As per zoo officials, around 10,000 people visit the Patna zoo daily.
 
 The zoo administration also plans to start an eco-friendly battery-operated non-AC trackless toy train within one year. The toy train would have engines on both sides. Zoo officials said each coach of the train would have at least 8 seats. The toy train is planned from gate number one to gate number two. Such a toy train runs in the Science City at Kolkata.
 
 The zoo authorities also plan to start two or three ‘shikaris’ in the lake. There are four pedal boats that are hired by the visitors. Authorities said the facility would start within a year.
