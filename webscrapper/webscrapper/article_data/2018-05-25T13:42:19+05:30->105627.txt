TRICHY: Citing the possibilities for house burglaries during the summer season,   district police issued an advisory recently to the people not to keep the doors of the house open at night for ventilation.

 The series of incidences of house break-ins and snatching in several parts of the district and the nearby districts prompted the newly appointed superintendent of police of Trichy, Zia Ul Haq to alert the people and prevent them from being victims in such crimes.
 
 The murder for gain at Perakambi village near Siruganur on April 23 was a classic example for such incident. A couple A Ramesh, 36 and his wife R Latha 30 lost their lives in the attack by the unidentified burglars.
 
 “The murder for gain incident in Siruganur and the house break-ins in nearby districts like Karur and   occurred when the houses were left open by the residents for ventilation in the summer time. So, we have found it appropriate to advice people in our district to avoid such practices,” SP Zia Ul Haq told TOI on Thursday.
 
 Unable to bear the brunt of the summer, people adopted the practice of keeping the doors open at night for ventilation. 
 
 But their exercise caused them trouble on many occasions as it made the opportunist burglars to gain entry without any force and decamp with the valuables. 
 
 He also insisted on keeping the police informed in case of leaving out of town for a long period and keep the lights on at night outside the house.
 
 The scene has become different this summer because of the summer rain which brought the temperature down in the mid May than the corresponding period last year in Trichy. 
 
 Four chain snatching incidents on Tuesday night by a duo in Manapparai, Puthanatham and Vaiyampatti areas also came in the wake of police pulling up their socks to prevent such crimes. 
 
 SP said that the investigation proceeded in the right direction and the two culprits will be caught as the CCTV footage helped to identify them.
