AHMEDABAD: Public sector banks in addition to a few private banks will remain closed on Wednesday and Thursday, as bank employees and officers have announced a total strike on May 30 and 31. Bank officers and employees have sought a wage revision. Some 50,000 bank employees and officers from across 47 banks in Gujarat will join the two-day strike.

 Bank officers and employees have been negotiating their wage revision with the   (IBA) since November 2017. As the IBA proposed 2% wage revision, bank employees have decided to go on strike. “Our wages are revised every five years. Giving us a meagre 2% wage revision is indeed an insult to bank employees. Moreover, this rise has been given only for employees of Scale-I, II and III, which is unfair,” said Janak Rawal, general secretary, Maha Gujarat Bank Employees Association.
 
 Many officials also brought up demonetization, during which bank officials had worked overtime. “We have worked past midnight when demonetization was announced, accounting for 47 days of extra work. We had sought compensation for this too but the amount was meagre. After all this, a mere 2% wage revision is unfair, especially when the revision was 15% during the previous time. We have also sought a five-day working week,” said Kamal Kadri, general secretary,  .
 
 “All the government schemes such as Jan Dhan Yojana, Stand Up India, Jeevan Jyoti and   and even   enrolment is now done at public sector banks. When we are burdened with so many responsibilities, it is only fair to compensate us appropriately,” he added.
 
 Bank employees and officers will also be holding a rally from Nehru Bridge Corner to Bank of Baroda, Ashram Road early on Wednesday morning. A major demonstration with more than 150 bank officers was also held on Tuesday evening, hooting slogans against the IBA and government policies.
