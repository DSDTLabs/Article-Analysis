MUMBAI: The city’s road scam resonated in the legislative assembly on Tuesday during question hour as BJP legislators raised doubts about the fairness in the inquiry being conducted by municipal commissioner   in the 2016 road scam.

 Atul Bhatkalkar (BJP) first raised the issue in the House, saying the commissioner is a member of the standing committee and asked if the government would appoint a special investigation team (SIT) to look into the road scam. Minister of state for urban development Ranjit Patil said the inquiry was in the last stages. To this Yogesh Sagar (BJP) said not only is the commissioner a member of the standing committee, he puts forward the proposal before the panel.
 
 “The administration also supervises the work. Will the state government appoint a SIT under the Commission of Inquiry Act,” he asked. Ashish Shelar (BJP) said the government must frame a policy that a contractor blacklisted by one corporation is not eligible for work in another. “Contractors blacklisted in the 2016 road scam were awarded contracts by another corporation,” he said. Patil said the written question was about road repair contracts being awarded in a hurry in January 2017 and not about the 2016 road scam. 
 
 Speaker Haribhau Bagade intervened and said the written answer referred to the 2016 road scam. Aslam Shaikh (Congress) said no big contractor had been arrested, though not a single road had been improved in accordance with the specifications.
 
 Rushing to Patil’s rescue, Shelar said the question should be reserved. 
 
 Shelar said an inquiry should be launched against these members who passed the proposal. At this Sada Sarvankar (Sena) said the issue was raised by the members when it came to the committee for approval. Opposition leader Vikhe-Patil said since the government is harping on transparency it must inquire into these issues. Patil said the government has already set up a committee and announced the setting up of upa lokayukta.
