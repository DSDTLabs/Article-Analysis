IMPHAL: Amid growing resistance to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 in the northeast, chief minister   said the proposed legislation would not have any effect on Manipur. 

 "The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill concerns  . It will not affect Manipur,"   told the media on Tuesday. The bill, introduced by the BJP-led government at the Centre, proposes citizenship for persecuted migrants belonging to religious minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Biren added that his government would, instead, table a bill to "protect the indigenous people of the state" in the upcoming assembly session. 
 
 While Manipur does not share a border with Bangladesh, protests against the bill have been growing on the basis of what it represents - regularization of the entry of migrants and its implications for indigenous people. On Monday, the All Manipur Students' Union had joined in the region-wide stir against the bill, calling it a "serious threat to the indigenous people of the northeastern states".
 
 For Manipur, the "influx" issue at hand is that of migrants from  , with which it shares a border. On Monday, police arrested eight Rohingya, including five minors, here with two United   for Refugees identity cards and four fake   cards. 
 
 Biren said, "Our government has initiated a massive drive against illegal migrants in the state and will continue with it." Referring to two fake Aadhaar units being busted recently, he added, "People of the state should be sincere and possess a nationalistic feeling. They should think about the state and not help illegal migrants," the chief minister said.
 
 Biren's statements come at a time when the campaign seeking an anti-migrant bill, spearheaded by the   on Inner Line Permit System, has been stepped up.
