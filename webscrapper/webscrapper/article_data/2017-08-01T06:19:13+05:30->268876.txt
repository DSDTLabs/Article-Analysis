MUMBAI: A week after a four-storey building in Ghatkopar collapsed last Tuesday, residents of the ill-fated structure who survived the crash said they are still awaiting alternative accommodation promised by the authorities. 

 Seventeen people, including two infants, died died when Siddhi Sai building crashed last Tuesday. The rubble has been cleared from the site and belongings gathered from the site have been currently kept on an open ground, about 10 minutes away from where the building stood.
 
 Binita Ramchandani, whose parents lived on the fourth floor, said they have so far attended meetings convened by authorities and elected representatives. "But the reality is that we are still homeless. We understand it will take time to find homes, but how long do we run from pillar to post?" she asked.
 
 Ramchandani said that the place where residents' belongings have been kept on the open ground has no shed placed over it. "Already, we have lost our everything. Now, we fear that little what we might be able to salvage from the rubble will get wet in the rain."
 
 Legislator Ram Kadam said that he has spoken to the chief minister about rehabilitating the residents. "Generally this takes time, but we're trying to accelerate things on humanity grounds... We hope to rehabilitate them in Ghatkoparitself," said Kadam. Corporator Archana Bhalerao said she has demanded that the building be reconstructed. "An inquiry team visited the site on Monday, but it will be difficult to comment on that," she said.
