CHENNAI:   rail will include several features including totems that would guide commuters as well as to nearby localities as to when the trains start running across the crowded stretches of  . 

 These totems are tall pillars that will have detailed route maps of both metro trains and the neighbourhoods. While totems are at present installed in underground stretch, when the phase-1 extension opens for public some time in 2019, they will become a regular feature in both elevated and underground stations. 
 
 However, such totems are to direct commuters to stations. According to officials totems are designed to be prominently visible structures placed close to identify the entries.
 
  These structures will have information panels with details of metro lines and other modes. It will also display line colours on which the particular station lies. In case of interchange stations, both line colours will be displayed and also other transport interchanges. The panel will also carry   timings.
 
 "There will be space for area map and metro rail route map on the totems, which will be useful for passengers leaving or entering the stations. The size of the totems may vary with the size of the stations," an official said.
 
 The seven underground metro stations between   and Thirumangalam have this feature either inside or outside the entry/exit points. The existing elevated stations though do not have them. In metro rail facilities in several other cities like Dubai, London, totems are usually installed to direct commuters to the nearest station. 
 
 However, metro rail officials here think having totems in nearby localities are not necessary, as the stations entry/exit points are all located in main roads.
