NEW DELHI/BERNE: Stepping up its hunt for black money stashed abroad, India has approached   for banking details of at least ten persons and entities suspected to have kept untaxed money in Swiss banks. These include two listed textile companies, while others are associated with an art curator and his carpet export business.

 At least ten such notices concerning individuals and companies with Indian links were issued last week — which could be the highest for a country within a week.
