Panaji: Authentic Goan dishes cooked the traditional way, right before your eyes. Taleigaonkars are offering this and much more on Saturday at a one-of-its-kind food and cultural festival. No gas cylinders will be needed at the venue and neither will food be brought in by caterers. Elders in the village will gather at the Taleigao Church Square and cook all the items on firewood right before guests. Everything from pulao, feijoada, caldinha, stew, assado, xacuti and sorpotel among other items are on the menu. “The aroma will have people salivating,” says Torres Martins, vice-president of the Centro Social e Cultural Sao Miguel de Taleigao, that is organizing the third edition of ‘Amchem Daiz’ in collaboration with the village panchayat and with the support of the directorate of art and culture. A pure vegetarian stall has been introduced where khot-kotem and ghongonem will be served. Taleigao’s youth are also taking charge of the sweet corner where the mouthwatering ‘godxem’ will be made available. “No food will be brought in from outside the venue,” Martins says, adding, “We want the youth to know the treasures of Goa’s cuisine and how food cooked hygenically at home never made anybody ill in the good old days.” On display at the festival will also be traditional kitchen and farming implements brought from the homes of Taleigaokars. Locally grown vegetables including ‘mudo’ and ‘tambdi bhaji’ will also be brought in by farmers. Brinjals and sweet potatoes, that Taleigao has always been famous for, will be a prominent part of this section. Music will have that traditional touch with a brass band to lighten the mood and take people back in time. The festival kicks off at 7pm. Entry is free, with nominal charges for the food.
