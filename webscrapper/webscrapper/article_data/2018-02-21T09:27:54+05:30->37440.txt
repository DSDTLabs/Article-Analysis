CHENNAI: Miscreants setting fire to heaps of trash piled up near the   grade separator is causing public outrage and threatening the well-being of local residents.

 Facebook user   on Monday posted pictures online of what appeared to be burning tyres blowing thick black smoke around the   grade separator. “This place is known for burning waste consistently. But this is insane. So much pollution and zero visibility,” she wrote in her post.
 
 On Tuesday, TOI visited the spot and found burning  . Satish Kumar, a motorist on the stretch told TOI that he felt irritation in his eyes every time he drove past the area. “My eyes burn due to the smoke. After I cross the area, I stop my vehicle to wash my eyes with water I carry,” he said.
 
 Last month, TOI reported how debris dumping goes unchecked in the stretch connecting the bypass road near Maduravoyal and Koyambedu. Municipal solid waste too is dumped in the space beneath grade separators. Notably, a portion of the Cooum river too has been taken over by organic and plastic waste dumped by conservancy workers of local bodies.
 
  officials washed their hands off the issue stating that the area fell outside their jurisdiction. Locals claimed that the conservancy workers of Adayalampattu panchayat were responsible for setting fire to waste. But the sheer volume of trash suggests that it should have taken more than one village panchayat to contribute to the mess.
