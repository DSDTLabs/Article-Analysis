Actor Soubin Shahir's debut directorial ' ' has been one of the much awaited project of the year. 

 Dulquer Salmaan, who would appear in an extended cameo role in the film, recently announced that the film will hit screens on September 21. He wrote, "I'm super excited to announce that Parava has been censored and certified with a U/A certificate (for some action sequences) ! I know all the posters feature me quite extensively but we just want to be honest with all of the viewers in saying that I'm in the film only around 25 mins. It's an extended cameo. But I would have done it even if it was just 5 mins because it is a terrific film and I think it will be a game changer. It's another huge blessing that I got to be a part of this film and I thank Allah daily for every chance I've been given. Also want to thank Anwar Ikka and Soubin for this amazing amazing opportunity and I loved every single moment of Parava ! Cannot wait for you all to watch it. You will love it just as much as I have."
 
 Srinda,   and Jacob Gregory are also part of the film, which is written by Soubin and Muneer Ali.
