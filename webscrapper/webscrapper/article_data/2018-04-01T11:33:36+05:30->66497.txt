MOHALI:   police are yet to register FIRs against owners of stray cattle found roaming on the city streets. Mohali municipal commissioner   had written to Mohali police on March 5 recommending for registration of FIRs against 149 odd dairy owners of the stray cattle.

 However, till date no action has been taken by the police despite MC’s prompting. Hans said, “We have sent a reminder to police for the registration of FIRs against such dairy owners who have been found letting their cattle stray roam in the city and disposing of the cow dung in sewerage system. Stray cattle have already become a chronic problem which is now accompanied by another issue of disposing cow dung in sewerage system.”
 
 MC commissioner Sandeep Hans said 166 dairy owners were issued notices in this regard under Section 188 of the Punjab Municipal Act on December 5. Hans said, “We have written to SSP recommending registration of FIRs against 149 odd dairy owners for letting their cattle lose in the city after milking and disposing of cow dung in sewerage system. It was observed that the cattle owners were in practice of disposing the cow dung after mixing it with water and then flowing it down the sewerage to clean their spaces. This leads to the blocking of the sewer resulting in overflowing during rainy season.”
 
 He said the cattle owners were given a 15 day-notice to stop the practice and when observed that the notice had been openly refuted, MC recommended for registration of FIRs. “We will start penalizing the violators and if required can also seal their cattle sheds,” said Hans.
 
 During the last MC   meet, mayor   requested councillors to stop being hand in gloves with cattle owners, “During the House meet, all councillors raise voice to catch stray cattle but when a team catches a stray cattle, they force team to leave the caught cattle. We must leave such double standards.”
