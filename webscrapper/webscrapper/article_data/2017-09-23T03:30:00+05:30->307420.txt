Margao: A search for a minor girl who was allegedly kidnapped from Ahmedabad, led the Gujarat police to Curchorem, on Friday. 

 The team found the girl and her abductor, Shivshanker Sahani, staying in a rented house in Curchorem, and took them into custody. 
 
 Curchorem police, who assisted their counterparts from Gujarat in tracing the duoâ€™s location, said the girl was allegedly kidnapped by Sahani in 2016, and that the police were on the lookout for her since. 
 
 Based on cellphone location signals traced by the Gujarat police, the cops arrived in Goa and nabbed the duo, police sources said.
