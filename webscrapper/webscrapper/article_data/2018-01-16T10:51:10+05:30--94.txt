INDORE: Congress MLA   along with 61 people, including five women, was   on Monday when they staged road blockade at Palda square to   water and electricity issues in the area. 

 Hundreds of ward-75 and 77 residents took to the streets against Indore Municipal Corporation and Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Cidyut Vitaran Company Ltd. 
 
 They demanded top officials of civic body and discom to come to the spot and discuss the problems being faced by them. When no officials turned up, Patwari and his supporters staged a road blockade. The protest hampered the vehicular movement in the area for around two hours. 
 
 The protesters were arrested when they remained adamant on continuing their protest after being stopped by police from disrupting peace and traffic. “MLA Jitu Patwari and 61 others were arrested for disrupting peace and vehicular movement in Palda. They were later sent to jail,” sub divisional magistrate Sandeep Soni told TOI. 
 
 While being transported in a bus to jail, the protesters created a ruckus. Some of them allegedly snatched key of the bus and also deflated its tyres. Another bus had to be arranged to ferry them to district jail, said police. 
 
 Patwari, who represents Rau assembly constituency, led over 500 residents, who were facing inadequate water supply and getting escalated electricity bills. 
 
 He targeted the IMC and discom authorities and said that inefficient handling of locals’ need has heightened their suffering. “None of these two government bodies want to work to provide basic facilities to the citizens,” alleged Patwari adding that despite continuous appeals to the authorities concerned, no relief has been provided to the residents and this forced them to stage protest.
