Of course, playing regular kabaddi did help me a lot," said Anthoniyammal.
 
 Second daughter of a milkman Savarimuthu, she was also instrumental in India's splendid performance in the Asian Beach Games at Vietnam last year. India clinched gold in the beach kabaddi by outplaying Thailand in the hard-fought finals with 33-23. She was drafted into the Indian team after her impressive show. She also represented Tamil Nadu in National Beach Kabaddi Championship held in January last year at Vishakapattinam. Tamil Nadu claimed bronze medal in the tournament. "Though played with similar rules and regulations, beach kabaddi is little different from the regular one. There are only six players in each side in beach kabaddi whereas there are 12 players in the regular one," said Anthoniyammal's coach Janarthanan.
