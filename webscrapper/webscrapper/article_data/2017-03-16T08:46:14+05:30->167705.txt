THRISSUR: The principal district sessions court here on Wednesday posted the anticipatory bail pleas of the two accused in the case relating to the unnatural death of Jishnu Pranoy, a student of the Nehru College of Engineering and Research Centre (NCERC) at  , for hearing on Thursday.

 The anticipatory bail pleas were filed by the college vice-principal   thivel and the faculty member C P Praveen. The petitions were to be heard on Wednesday, but the judge posted the case for Thursday after the counsels for the accused pleaded for postponing the case.
 
 Jishnu, a first year BTech student, was found hanging at the hostel of the college on January 6.
 
 The prosecution argument in the case is that the college management had prior enmity towards Jishnu as he had protested against their “illegal activities“. The management then implicated Jishnu in a false examination copying case and mentally tortured him by threatening that he would be debarred in the third semester.
 
 The accused in the case are college managing trustee P  , vice principal M K Sakthivel, assistant professor C P Praveen, PRO Sanjith Viswanathan and college staff examination cell member Bipin. Praveen was the invigilator in the examination hall when Jishnu had allegedly copied.
 
 The charges against the accused have been framed under various sections of the IPC like Section 306 (abetment of suicide), Section 323 (physical assault and causing injury) Section 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy), Section 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) and Section 201 destruction of evidence.
