 In a short video clip, which has gone viral on social media, the 'Views'   greets the pop superstar with a huge smile and shares his plan to get a Dion ink. 
 
 "It means the world, you're very iconic. We love you. I'm, like, a year away from a Celine tat," Drake tells Dion in the clip, gesturing toward the left side of his torso.
