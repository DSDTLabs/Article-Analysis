NEW DELHI: How does   prepare for a T20 match? On Saturday, a day ahead of the match against Delhi Daredevils, the   captain, seen sitting in the front passenger seat, was the first to step out of the team bus when it arrived at the Ferozeshah Kotla. He greeted a DDCA staff member with a smile and headed straight to the dressing room. Within 15 minutes, the whole team was out along with Kohli to play a round of football to warm up.

 Asked if he preferred yoga, Kohli told TOI, "I do yoga when I am at home. Otherwise, stretching and strengthening exercises are a must for me."
 
 RCB sweated it out in the extreme heat, with Kohli taking most of the initiative. They didn't resemble a team which has struggled throughout the tournament.
 
 Kohli, who is relatively new to captaining India across all formats - since January last - has faced a crisis for the first time as a captain in the  . "I am not trying anything extra. Just want to keep things simple," Kohli said after his regulation nets session, which lasted close to an hour.
 
 He was intense in the nets too - in between his hour long batting session, he rested for less than a minute to gulp some water. Also, with the IPL on, he didn't want to talk about India's   preparations. However, it was clear he was keen to ensure his 10-match losing streak with the Bangalore team didn't affect his morale as leader.
 
 As a batsman, he has managed 250 runs from nine matches, with 64 being his highest score, which is quite low by his standards. But some other Indian batsmen have fared no better -Ajinkya Rahane,   and MS Dhoni too have struggled. India openers   and   are the only two Indian batsmen ahead of Kohli in the run stakes.
