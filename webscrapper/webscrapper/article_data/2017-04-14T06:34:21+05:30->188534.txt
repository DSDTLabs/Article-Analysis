PUNE: The lack of liquor outlets on long stretches after the   banned   along highways could be a boon for bootleggers selling spurious stuff.

 An excise department official said illegal liquor trade might increase after the ban because of shortage of alcohol. “The number of retail shops selling liquor is now fewer in some areas, resulting in liquor shortage. With the shortage of manpower in the excise department, the cases of   trade may increase,” the official said.
 
 “We are concerned about bootlegging and emergent social evils of a black-market economy and a corruption-driven parallel economy, which the governments are trying hard to battle and weed out of our system,” said a source in the Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI).
 
 A liquor retailer said on the condition of anonymity that some outlets had started selling liquor at a very high rate after the ban. “A quarter bottle of country liquor is being sold at Rs100 instead of the earlier price of Rs50 in some places. We foresee a rise in smuggling of illicit liquor if the ban continues. There is barely anything available for country liquor buyers on the stretch from Nigdi to Lonavala. With this section of buyers having little money to travel far for liquor, their only option will be to turn to spurious liquor,” he said.
 
 A liquor distributor said, “Majority of retail outlets and bars on the Pune-Ahmednagar, Pune-Baramati and   stretches are shut. This is bound to increase the influx of illicit liquor from Goa and Daman. Once a person leaves the corporation limit, there is barely any legitimate source of liquor for at least 30-40 km. This may lead to an increase in illegal liquor business.”
