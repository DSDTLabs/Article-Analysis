A fun calendar day, ‘World Compliment Day’ simply addresses the basic human need for   and appreciation. While Teacher’s Day or   may be a tribute to specific people, this is something where everybody wins. The compliment giver not only gains emotionally, it also causes makes the person receiving the compliment feel good. But compliments are tricky — if not handed out right, they come across as cheesy and calculated. so, here are things to keep in mind to show   in the right way...

 - If you are letting a person know he/she is sincerely appreciated, do so with words, not gifts. Nothing beats a genuine  .
 - The first tip to remember is to pause and observe; nothing will give you a clearer indication of what to say other than paying attention to what is around you.
 - While trying to find the perfect compliment, people usually bark up the wrong tree, so to speak. Experts say that this is actually about finding the right moment. Timing matters.
 - Balance tact with spontaneity. While the compliments should be said as soon as the opportunity arises, don’t suddenly let loose a barrage. Keep it short and sweet, which will appear sincere.
 - Choose your words wisely. Remember people see through deception, so make sure to mean what you say. Phony sentences are easily detected by people. If you like what someone has worn, say, “Hey, I liked the jacket a lot, it’s neat.” Avoid things like, “Oh, I’ve been looking for this jacket all my life” or “It’s the most precious thing I’ve seen.”
 - At the underlying level, keep the intentions clear. In insincere compliment can make you seem selfish and crafty. Just hand it out of appreciation and that’s all.
 - The receiver, on the other hand, must accept a compliment graciously. Don’t return it with a disagreement. Saying, “Oh, I don’t really think it’s so nice,” to someone who has appreciated your bag; it’s like telling X or Y to take his or her compliment back.
 
 
 
 
 
 Never ever pay someone a compliment that is backhanded. This actually is not appreciation, but an insult. It expresses scorn and condescension and usually, uttered sans any remorse. Avoid saying, “Hey, you cooked that surprisingly well” or “You’re smart considering your age.” If you are critical about something, just hold all speech or say, “Hey, was wondering if we could have done this differently.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A recognition professional has been quoted saying, “Nothing stimulates more, gives more energy, makes people happier and, as far as business is concerned, increases   and commitment faster than sincere appreciation. So why not use it a little bit more?”
