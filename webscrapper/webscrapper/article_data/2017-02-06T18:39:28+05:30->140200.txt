Neighbours   and   are on an all-time bonding spree. While on one hand, Akshay’s wife   was all praise for Hrithik’s ‘Kaabil’ on social media, now Hrithik seems to be returning the favour. The ‘Mohenjo Daro’ star was spotted with his ex-wife   at a special screening of Akki’s ‘Jolly LLB 2’ on Sunday night. 

 Interestingly, the foursome spent Sunday morning together too – Sussanne had posted a picture of them chilling together at a five star hotel in the city. 
 
 In the evening, the ex-couple headed out to watch Akshay’s latest offering. Sporting casual attires, Hrithik and Sussanne were all smiles for the shutterbugs waiting outside the venue. The duo was followed by power-couple Akshay and Twinkle, who also paused for a round of media interaction. 
 
 ‘Jolly LLB 2’ also stars Huma Qureshi, Annu Kapoor, Saurabh Shukla and   in key roles. The film is all set to release on February 10.
