Panaji: The long overdue NH 17-B four-lane project from   to Sada junction will miss its October 2018 deadline due to delays in land acquisition from the ministry of defence and presence of utility and oil pipelines along the route, said official sources.

 The 7.8-kilometre-long stretch of NH 17-B, including an elevated road from Ravindra Bhavan junction to Mormugao Port Trust (MPT) appears to have once again ground to a halt due to the presence of an Indian Navy workshop along the route.
 
 “MPT has moved a proposal to the central government to construct a new building for the Navy at a cost of Rs 5 crore. A draft MoU has been prepared. Acquiring defence land is next to impossible and requires the President’s nod,” an official said.
 
 The project, originally conceived in the late 90s, was envisioned to improve connectivity to MPT and to prevent heavy cargo trailers from entering Vasco town. It is being undertaken jointly by three stakeholders; NHAI, MPT and Goa PWD.
 
 While the cost of the entire project is Rs 546 crore, Gammon India Pvt Ltd is building the elevated road-cum-flyover at Rs 397 crore. The project will also connect NH 17-B to MPT’s berth No. 9.
 
 With the approvals awaited, work on the remaining portion of the four-lane highway project has slowed down to a crawl.
 
 “Just 40% of the physical work has been done and 30% of the financial contribution. The scheduled completion was October 2018, but we are lagging behind. There is a naval workshop, some pipelines and a few other hindrances. It will get pushed to 2019,” an official close to the project said.
 
 The much-awaited project has been stalled for about 17-18 years since 1998.
 
 The four-lane highway project is meant to divert heavy traffic from the city roads, reduce accidents and decrease sound and air pollution in the port town.
