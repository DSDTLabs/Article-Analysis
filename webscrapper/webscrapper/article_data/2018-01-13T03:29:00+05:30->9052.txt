Vijayawada: The police and revenue department officials are now in a quandary after the latest Supreme Court ( ) order on cockfights in the state.

 The apex court said on Friday that its earlier order on the issue stands valid and will be in force. Galla Satish, one of the advocates who represented the petitioner, said the SC has however allowed the petitioner to approach the Hyderabad High Court for modification of its earlier order, where it wanted complete ban on cockfights in the state. BJP leader K Raghurama Krishnam Raju had moved the apex court seeking relief from the HC order. He argued in his petition that the court, while delivering its recent order on cockfights, did not take certain points into consideration.
 
 Now,   organisers have devised a legal way to comply with the latest order, as the earlier SC order had only banned the tying of knives to the cocksâ€™ limbs and the gambling associated with it. The apex court also put some riders before the enforcement agencies.
