HYDERABAD: The   (KRMB) on Wednesday allotted 50 tmc of water to   and 60 tmc to   from the available water in   and   reservoirs. 

 KRMB chairman   held a key meeting with Telangana and AP irrigation officials and finalised the allocation for the rabi season. KRMB, while accepting the sharing ratio of 66:34 between AP and Telangana of the available water, asked the two states to make better use of the water in two reservoirs.
 
 Out of 130 tmc of water available in the two common reservoirs in Krishna basin, the board which met here has decided allocation of 110 tmc and left 20 tmc for future allocation. 
 
 
 
 Since both states have submitted different statistics over their own water utilisation which was not correlating with the available water, the board has not allocated 20 tmc pending the examination of the figures.
 
 While Telangana has placed indent with the board seeking 17.6 tmc to meet its needs for January, AP insisted on allotment of 38 tmc for the same period. Directing both states to be prudent in water utilisation, KRMB also advised judicious utilisation of the water from both Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar reservoirs.
