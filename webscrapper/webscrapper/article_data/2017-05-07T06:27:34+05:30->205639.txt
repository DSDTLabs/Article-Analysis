KOCHI: Tripunithura municipal council witnessed a stormy session on Saturday when opposition councillors belonging to   and BJP raised the issue of former secretary S   issuing building permit to Sobha Developers to construct an apartment complex in violation of the Kerala Conservation of   and Wetland Act, 2008. 

 Succumbing to the pressure by the opposition, the municipal authorities agreed to place the files related the application submitted by the builder for securing permit at the next council meeting.
 
 UDF took up the issue after TOI reported about it on April 28. Holding the report, UDF demanded to place the file related to the builder's application in the council. 
 
 K G Sathyavrathan, opposition leader, said that if the chairperson   refused to place the file in the council, the party would approach the National Green Tribunal against the project. He said, "It is the leaders of the ruling front based in Thiruvananthapuram who managed to get the former secretary appointed in the municipality for a short period. This was for facilitating the issuance of permit to the builders." 
 
 Though the chairperson refuted the allegations, she gave in to the opposition demand and declared that the files would be placed in the council when it meets next.
 
 TOI had reported that Jayakumar gave building permit in March this year disregarding the order of district collector who rejected permission for residential project of Sobha developers at Silversand Island.
 
 BJP councillor   said, "I have applied for accessing documents of the building permit under RTI. But officials have been reluctant to give reply to my application citing lame excuses. They said the report was prepared solely by the secretary himself discarding the objections raised by engineers and overseers. We want to expose the foul play involved in allowing the building permit to Sobha Developers".
