VIJAYAWADA: IIT aspirants from the education hub of  , Vijayawada, are apparently upset with the stay order issued by the   on this year’s admissions. The Apex Court’s stay comes after more than 30,000 admissions have been completed in the country’s premier institutes of technology.

 In 2017, an estimated number of 13,000 students from Andhra Pradesh appeared for the exam and the row over awarding an additional 18 marks in the examination has drawn   from various sections of students and college managements. 
 
 However, most of the 3,765 students who qualified the test this year have opined that the JEE exam control board should have been more careful in setting the paper and a difference of 18 marks could be a step that decides the fate of many aspirants.
 
 Even the parents do not seem to be in a mood to welcome the stay order issued on the admissions either. “The mistake has happened and as we are already into the second week of July, I wish the admission process resumes as early as possible to ensure that no more time is wasted,” said Anusha, a parent Anusha.
