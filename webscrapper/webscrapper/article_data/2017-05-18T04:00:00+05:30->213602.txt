AHMEDABAD: Despite the   results being out, there is no progress on admissions to undergraduate medical and paramedical courses. There are some 11,000 medical and paramedical seats including dental and physiotherapy in the state. 

 Around 59,004 students passed in the state board exams in the B Group. While the admission committee for professional courses ( ) has already begun distributing admission kits, there is no word about any such procedure at the admission committee for medical courses.
 
 This time round, medical and paramedical admissions will be based on the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) exam, which was held on May 7. While the ACPC held 100 seminars on the admission process, with the help from the state education board, there has been no such initiative by the committee for medical admissions.
