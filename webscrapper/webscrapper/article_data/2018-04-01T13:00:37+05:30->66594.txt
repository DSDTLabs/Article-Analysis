HYDERABAD: The whereabouts of a woman from  , who went missing in Madina, Saudi Arabia, are not known. Even the Indian embassy in   is trying to trace her. The Consulate General of India, Jeddah, has tried to call   Begum on two numbers from which she had earlier called her family but there was no response. She had gone to Saudi in 2014 after an agent duped her and sold her to a kafil (employer).

 “I am fearing for my daughter’s life. Last when I spoke with her, she told me that she was facing a lot of problems in Saudi. She wanted to be rescued and brought back to India,” Shakera’s mother   told TOI. Zaheda said Shakera also complained of being harassed and physically tortured by her kafil. Shakera last spoke to Zaheda in June 2017.
 
 Zaheda wrote to Union external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, saying Shakera was sold by an agent who trafficked her to Saudi. The agent used marriage tactic for trafficking Shakera, alleged Zaheda. After death of Shakera’s husband Mohd Jaffer, a relative Mohammed   had approached them and expressed desire to marry Shakera, who has four children.
 
 Akbar told Shakera he would work as a driver and she could work as a maid with a family in Saudi. Both travelled to Dubai, but Akbar flew back to Hyderabad while Shakera was sent to Saudi. Zaheda said Akbar lives with his first wife. On confrontation, he told Zaheda he had no knowledge about Shakera. “I want Sushma Swaraj to help bring my daughter back. I am finding it extremely difficult to even provide food to Shakera’s four children,” Zaheda rued.
