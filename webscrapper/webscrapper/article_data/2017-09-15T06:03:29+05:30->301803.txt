BENGALURU: It's official.There is a “very high“ chance that the gun used to kill journalist-activist   last week outside her Bengaluru residence was the same that was used in the murder of scholar MM   in Dharwad two years ago, the preliminary ballistics report submitted by the   to the Special Investigating Team has said.
The Times of India broke the news on Wednesday that the   report had hinted that the same weapon was used in both crimes. The FSL report also confirmed that the weapon used to kill   was a 7.65mm countrymade pistol, sources in the SIT probing the killing said.
 
 An SIT officer said they are now waiting for bullets and cartridges recovered in the case of Kalburgi killing to reach them. “These are with the CBI, Mumbai. Through a court application, we have re quested the CBI to hand over the articles -bullets and cartridges -to us at the earliest,“ the officer said.
 
 Once these articles reach the SIT, they will be sent to the FSL for testing, sources said. “If the striation marks on the bullets and cartridges match with those on the cartridges in Gauri's case, it will be 100% confirmation that Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh were killed from the same 7.65mm country-made pistol,“ sources said.
 
 It may be recalled that the FSL had ear lier found that the gun used to kill Kalburgi in August 2015 was one of the two firearms used to murder Communist leader Govind Pansare in Pune a few months earlier.
 
 The second firearm used in Pansare killing was found to have been used in the mur der of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar in Kolhapur 2013.
