Panaji: The office of the North Goa collector, on Monday, issued a stop-work order to a Vasco-based real estate company that was carrying out hill-cutting activity along the Old Goa-Panaji bypass. TOI had reported that excavation continued at the site despite complaints to authorities. In a letter to North Goa collector Nila Mohanan, dated January 7, 2018, locals said that seven trucks and two JCBs were seen operating at the site and that trucks displayed an ‘On govt duty’ indication. Sources in the collectorate said that following complaints, a flying squad was dispatched for site inspection, which submitted its report to the collectorate. Based on the report, action was initiated against the company on Monday, sources said. In the stop-work notice, deputy collector Sheru Shirodkar said that a complaint regarding hill-cutting in the Chimbel village was received and that during inspection, it could not be ascertained whether the company had valid permissions, licences, etc, for hill cutting as required under the Town and Country Planning Act. The site is positioned on the southern side of the bypass and overlooks the khazan fields of Merces and Chimbel towards the south.  “We direct the persons concerned to immediately stop the said work and to explain as to why action should not be taken against them for restoration of the said land back to its original condition within three days from the receipt of this order,” the notice read. Police constable Sushant Naik has been directed to paste the stop-work order at the site and submit a service report to the office, sources said. A long strip of hill just above the Chimbel slope, about the size of a football ground, has been gouged to create space for some construction work. Locals had informed the panchayat after raising the issue at the gram sabha late last year. The panchayat had agreed to look into the matter.
