 Naal-e-Mubarak is one of the important shrines in Hyderabad as the alams (processional standards) kept in the building contain a portion of the war helmet (Naal) of Moula Hussain. Failure to maintain thebuilding hastaken a toll on its structural stability.
 
 After every heavy rain, slabs of mortar fall from the roof. The latest episode occurred on Thursday night after the unseasonal downpour accompanied by thunderstorm struck Old City.
 
 The Ashoorkhana is located at Pathergatti. The alams as well as the building are important from religious, social, cultural, historical and heritage point of view. Safety of the historic alams is also threatened.
 
 Shia leader and Telangana BJP minority cell spokesperson Firasat Ali Baqri, who inspected the Ashoorkhana, criticised the Waqf board for “failing to maintain” the historic building. “Several representationswere made to the waqf board. But all of them fell on deaf ears. It is a matter of a few lakhs of rupees. The board lacks the will to maintain religious structures,”   told TOI.
 
 Naal-e-Mubarak Alam is about470 yearsold.Originally it was kept in Golconda Fort and from there it was shifted to Hyderabad after the city was created in 1591. Till the invasion of the   kingdom by the Moghuls, the alam was kept at a palace near Charminar. After the fall of the  ,theAlam wasshifted to the present location. The Asaf Jahs, who succeeded the Qutub Shahis, patronized the Ashoorkhana. It, however, fell on bad days after the Waqf board took control.
 
 Naal-e-Mubarak Alam is the only processional standard in the country to contain relics of the war helmet of   about 14 centuries ago.
