The 18 officers not dismissed include a secretary in Raj Bhawan and Home department and a staff officer of the chief secretary, besides six personal staff of previous chief minister  .

 The orders to dismiss the retired officials on extension were issued by chief minister   to chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar, late Saturday night.

These are Krishna Gopal in the appointment department, RD Paliawal as staff officer of the chief secretary, Mukesh Mittal, who looked after the budget section in the finance department, JP Singh in the state election commission and 14 others.
 
 Among those set to lose their job are SP Singh, the promoted IAS officer who was known to be a close confidante of former urban development minister Mohammed Azam Khan and stayed in the department as secretary despite his retirement a year back. Singh was so powerful that at one point he declined appointment as a member in a government body by governor Ram Naik which left the latter upset.
