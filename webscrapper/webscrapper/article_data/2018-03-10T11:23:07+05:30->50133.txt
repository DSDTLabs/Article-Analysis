VADODARA: The rustication row that has hit the Institute of Leadership and Governance (ILG) at M S University ( ) took a curious turn on Friday as   announced that it is ready to provide one more chance to those students who have failed to submit their fees, documents and undertaking at its office so far. 

 ILG’s announcement came even as the two reportedly rusticated students –   and Manisha Solanki – continued issuing threats of a state-wide protest if they do not get justice within three days. 
 
 The two students who have alleged that they were rusticated for meeting JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar during their study tour on Friday garnered support from dalit leader and Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani who has assured them that he will also urge both   and   to join the state-wide stir to ensure free education from KG to PG level in the state. “The decision to suddenly rusticate the two students who were attending their classes since November reflects the state of education in  ,” Mevani said in a statement issued in support of the two students. 
 
 Reacting to ILG’s announcement that it was ready to provide one more chance to those students who could submit fees, produce proper documents and undertaking, the two students demanded assurance from MSU vice-chancellor. Continuing their threats to launch a major stir from ‘sankalp bhumi’, the students termed the announcement as a “childish act”. 
 
 While ILG office-bearers have claimed that Solanki could not produce supporting documents to prove her eligibility, the students have questioned the institute’s stand. 
 
 “If Solanki did not have proper documents, how was she allowed to attend classes, take part in study tour while an identity card was also issued to her,” the duo questioned.
