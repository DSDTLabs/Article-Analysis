GURUGRAM: Construction of the city’s first state-run university proposed at Kakrola-Bhangrola in   will start in April, state PWD minister   said here on Saturday.

 “The work on the university in Gurugram will start in the month of April. Once ready, the university will help accelerate development of the city,” the minister said at a public gathering at Kakrola in the day.
 
 The university is likely to start functioning out of the   campus in Sector 51 from this academic year itself.
 
 While laying the foundation stone for the university in June last year, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had pledged a sum of Rs 5 crore for the initial phase of construction which is going to start on 50 acres provided by the panchayats of Kakrola and Bhangrola villages. The chief minister had also given divisional commissioner D Suresh additional charge of the new varsity.
 
 Currently, there are five private universities in Gurugram, but no government-run facility for higher studies. 
 
 In October 2014, during his first visit to the city as chief minister, Khattar had announced the project and asked the four local MLAs to decide the location for the proposed university.
