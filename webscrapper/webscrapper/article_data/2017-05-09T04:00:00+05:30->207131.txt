Vadodara: Tausif Patel, who is in jail, for allegedly kidnapping Shivang Patel, a resident of Pratapgunj, and Vinesh Verma, a resident of Harni Road, in November last year, has applied for regular bail in sessions court.

 Patelâ€™s application will come up for hearing on Tuesday. Patel has requested for bail on the grounds that the complaint against him was filed over a past rift. He told the court that the police has completed in the case and had also filed the chargesheet, thus his custody was not needed.
 
 His application also mentions that the other accused in the said offence had been released on bail by Gujarat high court thus on principle of parity, he too should be released on bail. Patel and five others including the key accused Premal alias Prem Parekh had allegedly kidnapped Shivang and Verma after they were promised an exchange of invalidated notes with new currency. The accused had then demanded Rs one crore as amount in demonetized currency.
