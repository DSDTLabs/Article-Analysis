Trichy: Devotees thronged in numbers at the famed Brihadeeswarar temple, popularly known as the Big Temple, in Thanjavur, on the occasion of temple car festival, which was organised on Thursday.  The car festival forms an integral part of the ongoing ‘Chithirai Thiruvizha’ in the temple, which commenced with the traditional flag hoisting ceremony on April 12. On Thursday, the festival started at 4 am when the idols of Lord Thiagarajar, Goddess Kamalambal and Lords Ganesha, Vinayagar, Subramaniar and Chandikeswarar were taken to the West Main Street where the car was situated.  After special poojas were done, the temple car procession started at around 5.40 am and thousands of devotees pulled the car through west, east, north and south main streets.  While the idols of Lord Thiagarajar and Goddess Kamalambal were seated in the bigger car, other idols were seated in smaller cars. Minister for agriculture, R Duraikannu, Rajya Sabha MP R Vaithilingam and Thanjavur district collector A Annadurai inaugurated the procession. Post the procession, which got over at around 11 am, special darshan was organised for the devotees. Elaborate security arrangements were made by the police to ensure smooth conduct of the festival. After a gap of more than 100 years, the temple car festival is being organised at the temple from 2015 after the old and dilapidated car was replaced with a new one. The 18-day Chithirai Thiruvizha will come to an end on April 29.
