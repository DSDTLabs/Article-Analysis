JAIPUR: Rubbishing allegations made by   of 91 farmers committing suicide during   rule, state home minister Gulab Chand   claimed that no farmer in the state had committed suicide due to debt. 

 Speaking at a press conference at BJP headquarter on Wednesday, he told media that no farmer committed suicide in the state from 2008-2017 including the Congress rule from 2008-2013. “Police report says that only three farmers killed themselves in 2015. Suicides due to debt can be ascertained only after the recovery of such a suicide note or established by police investigation,” said Kataria. The minister asked Congress to rise above the blame game. “Congress should tell us how much they cared for farmers. They should share the list of welfare schemes or special package they have announced for the farmers,” said Kataria. 
 
 “I can say that our government has provided interest free loans and waived loans of farmers along with providing all assistance required by farmers. In the nineties, our government waived Rs 10, 000 off farmers and now in 2018 we have waived off Rs 50,000 farm loan. This shows our concern for farmers,” said Kataria.
 
 Kataria refused to answer directly on the delay in announcing the BJP state president, “Whosoever will be our president will get full support from each and every worker.”
