HYDERABAD: The last two road   that resulted in instant deaths in the city have brought to fore the limitations of a prime safety feature — air bags. This safety feature comes at an additional cost of Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, which many buyers cough up in hope of safety. But contrary to popular belief, air bags are not foolproof no matter what the upper speed limit of the car is, say experts. 

 According to them, air bags don’t open if the driver or passenger is not wearing a seat belt. Also there are a lot of other technical conditions applicable to air bags, such as seating position. In case a driver is in a titled position, the air bag will not open properly, confess car salespersons and experts.
 
 “A large number of motorists do not wear seat belts. It also means that they are practically without any safety feature as air bags only work when the seat belts are fastened,” said T  , director general of police, road safety (Telangana).
 
 He added: “Although some cars have a reminder beep to ensure that the driver wears the seat belt, we have seen cases where people fasten the seat belt behind their backs instead of front to silence the beep. These factors add to the fatalities even if the motorist is driving a high-end car with safety features.”
 
 Sales executives often lure customers with the air bag feature, but they agree that its effectiveness is reduced drastically in case of speeding. “City roads are not meant for going beyond 40-50 kmph and   means hitting obstructions that can crush 30-40% of the car. Also, after touching 100-120 kmph , all cars are difficult to control. In case of smaller cars, 80 kmph is the upper limit ,” said  , showroom manager, Mohan Motors Ameerpet.
