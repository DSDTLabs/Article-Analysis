THIRUVANANTHAPUM:   A K   demanded that the Centre should roll back its recent hike in  , driving licence and other services with retrospective effect from December 29, 2016. He asked Union minister for road transport   to review the decision and withdraw the hike on Saturday.

 “This autocratic decision of the Centre burdens the common man in a democratic nation. The Centre should have at least discussed the decision with the state governments and considered our opinion. There is no guidelines for the hike. The common man is recovering from the demonetisation exercise,” he said.
 
 Mentioning the effect of hike in registration fees on KSRTC, he said that it will affect the agency to roll out more buses. Saseendran added that a decision on fund allocation will be taken after the Sushil Khanna committee submits its report on restricting KSRTC by January 17.
 
 “In Kerala, where many try to get a job in the Gulf, the hike in international driving permit from Rs 3,00 to Rs 1,000 has shattered their dream. 
 
 The hike in auto registration from Rs 300 to Rs 1000 indicates an impractical decision,” he said.
