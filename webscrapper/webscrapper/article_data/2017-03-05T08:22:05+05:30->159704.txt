DUMKA: Having drawn flak from the   over amendments in tenancy laws, the   is now trying to bridge the gap with the community in Santhal Parganas.

 The saffron party has decided to organise a   with the party’s scheduled tribe front in Dumka on  . Chief minister Raghubar Das and BJP’s state president Laxman Gilua is expected to participate in the meet.
 
 “We have been directed to ensure the participation of at least five party workers from each panchayat of  , who will be entrusted with the task to convince community members in their respective areas about the positive aspects of the amendments,” BJP’s district president Niwas Mandal said.
 
 The conference is viewed as a move to woo tribals ahead of the bypolls in Littipara assembly constituency, under Pakur district, a part of which also falls under Gopikandar block of Dumka district.
 
 The BJP is trying hard to bring the tribal community members of Santhal Pargana in the party fold, who have been the support base of the JMM traditionally.
 
 “As of now, the tribals have distanced themselves from the BJP. The party is now desperate to retain its base in Santhal Pargana,” a senior party functionary said, adding that the impending Littipara bypolls will prove to be a litmus test for the party.
 
 The Littipara assembly constituency is a tribal-dominated area with JMM having secured the seat for the last four decades in a row. JMM managed to win this seat last election, even though party member Simon Marandi revolted and contested unsuccessfully on BJP ticket.
 
 Marandi and his deceased wife Sushila Hansda had earlier represented the Littipara assembly seat throughout and the former’s defeat last elections was evidently indicative of JMM’s sustained influence among the local tribal electorate. Marandi, however, is once again trying to make a comeback to JMM, having left the saffron party.
