 TOI had earlier quoted a police source as saying that Dharmendra, Jitendra’s brother, and sub-inspector Vijay Darshan were in touch with each other over the phone. There have been allegations that Vijay had shot at Jitendra in Parthala village in Sector 122 and tried to make it look an encounter to get an “out-of-turn” promotion.
 
 “Dharmendra and his relatives would also frequent the police chowki where Vijay Darshan was deployed,” a police source said.
