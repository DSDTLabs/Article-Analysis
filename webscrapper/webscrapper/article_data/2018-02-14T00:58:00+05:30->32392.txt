Coimbatore: Even as the city civic body has started the tender process to contract sanitation works, temporary sanitary workers have petitioned corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan urging him to include government order which deals with their pay hike in the contract terms to ensure its implementation.

 “We get a salary of just Rs 8,000 a month despite the government order specifying that we should get minimum wage of Rs 16,000-18,000. Permanent sanitary workers employed by the corporation get a salary between Rs 20,000-24,000 a month besides a lot of benefits. Though we do the same amount of work, we get lesser salary than them. We also don’t have any holidays,” said a worker.
