MANALI: Hope of finding missing   engineer, 23-year-old Aman Awasthi, is fading fast.

 Awasthi was on a solo trip to Parbati valley in Himachal’s Kullu district. He has been missing since March 8 when he was last seen in   village where he was living in a homestay.
 
 Last week, Awasthi’s clothes and shoes were recovered in a forest between Malana and   pass. Despite initial hopes that the engineer would be located soon, there has been no headway in the case.
 
 “We have concentrated our search in that particular area and in surroundings of Malana. The police had stopped the search for two days due to bad weather conditions, but will resume it on Friday,” a police official from Jari police station said.
 
 Parbati valley is notorious for open supply of charas and tourists going missing. A large number of tourists, mostly trekkers, go missing regularly. According to police, use of drugs and not hiring local guides are main reasons behind missing cases. There are some mysterious cases where reasons for people going missing are still unknown. While some bodies have been recovered, there others have not been found till now.
 
 The search for the Gurugram man started in earnest when his father   arrived in Kullu on March 13. Teams of local police, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, local rescue experts and villagers joined the search and combed local forests, but failed to locate him. Awasthi’s father has returned home, but the search operation is still on.
 
 Chhape Ram Negi, a search and rescue expert from Parbati valley, said on phone from Malana jungles: “Search is still on. We tried all possible places, but got no success. We are still hopeful. There are some treacherous places. My team and locals from Malana village are searching him everywhere in the valley. We also used drone cameras. A helicopter can also be used, but I don’t think that it will prove of much benefit after such a long period.”
