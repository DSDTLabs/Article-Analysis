VADODARA: The students and staff members of city-based Convent of Jesus and Mary School were surprised on Thursday morning when their former student professor   aka Venki made an impromptu visit to the school.

 Venki visited his alma mater with his schoolmates   and   as well as his father C V Ramakrishnan. Venki went straight to meet the principal and later told the students about his school days and interacted with them in the school’s auditorium.
 
 Venki told the students that when he was in class seven he had lost interest in studies and his grades had also gone down. “I used to read history, literature books and comics but by the time I was in class nine, I again gained interest in studies due to my science and mathematics teacher,” said Venki.
 
 A student asked Venki where he sees the country 10 years from now. Answering the question Venki said that it is hard to predict but he added that without proper direction in infrastructural and other development, the country will become chaotic. “The prosperity of the country should be invested more in the urban planning, then only India can achieve the transition that China has made,” he said.
 
 The   winner also shared his first reaction when he was told that he had won the prestigious award. “I had a disagreement with one of the members on committee on one aspect of ribosome. So when the prize was declared, I was surprised,” he said.
 
 Venki also told the students that addiction to social media is a worldwide problem. “Even I keep checking my mails during work. But, it is a double-edged sword. Students can find all information on the internet and watch science videos on YouTube,” said Venki. He added that the problem can be solved only if usage of smartphones is restricted in classes.
 
 After the interaction, Venki spent close to an hour with his friends walking around in the school campus.
