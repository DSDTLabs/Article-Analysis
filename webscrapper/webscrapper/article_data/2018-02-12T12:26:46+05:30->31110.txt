 The company has set up 13 temporary townships — Kashi Nagar, Kalasha Nagar, Panchakalyana Nagar, Police Nagar, Seva Nagar, Media Nagar, Yatri Nagar and others — and have deployed he housekeeping staff at these townships.
 
 Around 700 waste bins of 100-litre capacity each have been placed by the company around the region. The housekeeping staff clears the waste from streets and townships, and dumps it in these bins.
 
 According to the housekeeping staff, the waste bin is filled on every third day. The civic agency then collects the waste from these bins and shifts it to the solid waste management units in trucks, which are set up outside the town. The garbage will be later converted into manure.

Keeping the place clean and tidy when VVIPs, religious leaders and lakhs of devotees attend the event is a big challenge,” he said.
