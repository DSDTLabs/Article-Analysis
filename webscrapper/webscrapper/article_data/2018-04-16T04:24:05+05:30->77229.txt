MUMBAI: The   police on Saturday registered a case of cheating and hacking against an unidentified person for duping the US-basead client of a Mumbai businessman to the tune of Rs 1.38 crore by creating a fake email account. The police said that the crime took place between December 19 last year and April 14. 

 "The complainant,   (43), a   resident, told the police that he has a client in California. The accused had created Somani's fake email account and contacted his California client through mail. The accused asked the client to transfer money to another account. The client, who was unaware of the fake account, transferred $ 2.10 lakh (about Rs 1.38 crore), taking it to be Somani's account. However, it was a fake account created by the accused," said apolice officer.
 
 Later, the fraudster created another fake account of Somani's US client and asked Somani's firm to deposit money in it. However, Somani suspected something amiss and did not deposit the money. He later lodged a police complaint for cheating and hacking. TNN
