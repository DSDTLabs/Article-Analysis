BENGALURU: With the mega Indian   auction slated for January 27 and 28, the   management on Monday confirmed their coaching staff led by head coach  , who has been at the helm since 2014. 

 Although talks of India’s 2011 World Cup-winning coach   has been doing the rounds for a while, the former South African batsman, it is learnt, signed on the dotted line last week. This will be Kirsten’s second stint in the IPL after his three-year contract was cut short to a year by   in 2015. 
 
 The 50-year-old is currently in Australia coaching the Big Bash side  . Joining Kirsten in the coaching roster is the recently-retired  , who was also a part of the Indian team coached by Kirsten. 
 
 The duo, apart from being the batting and bowling coach respectively, will also double as mentors in their areas of expertise for the Bengaluru franchisee. With the vision of long-term development of the squad and bringing in fresh talent from across the country, the franchisee has realigned the roles of Trent Woodhill and Andrew McDonald. 
 
 Woodhill, the man credited for the success of the likes of Australian stars David Warner and Steve Smith, will move from being a batting coach to a new designation — batting talent development and analytics and fielding coach. During the offseason, the 47-year-old Australian will also serve as head of scouting.
