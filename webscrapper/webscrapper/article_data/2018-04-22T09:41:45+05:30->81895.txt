MYSURU/MANDYA: Targeted by rightwingers, actor-activist   said on Saturday he would feel "unsafe" in   if   was elected to office.

 Raj, who had earlier shared a video of him being heckled allegedly by BJP workers in Kalaburagi, told reporters in Mysuru, "I was attacked in   by BJP workers. My car was attacked and stones were pelted at me. If BJP comes to power in the state, I will feel unsafe to live in the state. My fear is increasing with each passing day."
 
 Explaining his opposition to calls for a Hindu nation, Raj kicked up a controversy by likening it to making the crow the national bird. "If the majority of hindus becomes a yardstick to declare India a Hindu nation, then the crow whose population is more than that of the peacock must have been declared our national bird. The majority of one particular religion cannot be considered for declaring a nation," he said at an interaction in Mandya.
