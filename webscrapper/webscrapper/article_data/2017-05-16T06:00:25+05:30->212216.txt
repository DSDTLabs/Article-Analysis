BELAGAVI:   from   who have not received compensation for  , have approached the   

 These farmers had bought paddy crop i n the kharif season in 2014 and had insured their crops by paying the premium amount at the nodal bank in the village. But due to inadequate rainfall, the kharif crops dried up and the farmers suffered huge losses. Except for 17, all the farmers got compensation from the insurance company. 
 
 When these farmers approached the nodal bank, they were taken for a ride. Bank of India first assured them that the compensation will be provided, but after a wait of two years, the bank officials washed their hands of the issue, saying that the farmers will not get any compensation. 
 
 The helpless farmers then approached advocate Ravindra Totiger and issued a notice to the bank and the insurance company. Nine farmers have already filed a case in the janata court and three have issued notice to the bank and insurance company. 
 
 In a reply to the notice issued by farmers,   has said that there were 14 districts in their limits for kharif crop in 2014, and Belagavi district was not among them. "The responsibility of Belagavi district was given to IFFCO Tokio General Insurance Company Limited. We have not received any declaration from the nodal bank, so there is no question of paying the compensation," the insurance company stated. 
 
  Chidambar Pattanshetti, a farmer, said, "I have been visiting the bank twice a week since two years. They kept promising me that I will receive the compensation, and now, have left all of us in the lurch. I had also submitted a memorandum to the district authority, but it was of no help. Now, I am expecting justice from the court." 
 
 V J Patil, joint director, agriculture department, said, "The MK Hubballi branch of Bank of India was compelled to pay Rs 20 lakh for committing a mistake in the documents in 2014-15. I have not heard about the case of Kadoli. I will review the case and help the farmers get justice."
