CHENNAI: A week after West Bengal chief minister Mamata   called DMK working president M K   over phone to invite his party into the proposed third front, former   president   invited him to a dinner meeting of opposition party leaders scheduled for March 13 in New Delhi.

 While Stalin has not responded to Banerjee’s proposal, he has decided to depute his sister and   member   to attend the dinner meet. “Stalin informed   Gandhi that he would be preoccupied with other work in Chennai and hence would send a representative, Kanimozhi, to the dinner,” said a DMK leader.
 
 
 “Banerjee wanted the DMK to coordinate with other regional parties too. She feels comfortable working with the DMK. Banerjee suggested that all federal parties stay in touch and work cohesively as a bloc,” he said, adding that Sonia Gandhi planned the dinner diplomacy to thwart formation of a strong third front.
 
 For the DMK, the Congress is its ally for now though there is unease in the relationship. Rajinikanth’s political entry is the only threat it may have to face in the coming election.
