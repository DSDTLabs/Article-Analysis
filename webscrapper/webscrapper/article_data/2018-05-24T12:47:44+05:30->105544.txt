LUDHIANA: A major fire broke out at a cardboard and paper mill in Focal Point on Wednesday morning.

 Sparking in a printing unit machine triggered the blaze that soon spread in the godown.
 
 Fire department officials said they received a call around 9.30am and rushed seven fire tenders to Nahar Cardboard and Paper Mills Private Limited, Phase V, Focal Point. A hosiery firm located on nearby  , too, sent a tender to the spot. 
 
 “Timely efforts checked further spread of the blaze,” said sub-fire officer Srishti Nath  .
 
 Employees were working in the one-storey unit when flames started engulfing it. “The workers ran out and called up the fire department and the factory owner. The inflammable material caught fire quickly and thick smoke filled the unit. It made the operation difficult. After we controlled the flames, we checked the godown. Cardboard and other material were still burning,” he added. 
 
 “After sparking in the printing unit machine, there was a blast that spread the blaze,” said a worker. 
 
 The factory was equipped with fire extinguishers and a hydrant. “Before firemen reached the spot, workers tried to douse the flames. The firemen took water from an industrial unit that was opposite the mill. Some of the tenders were refilled from a   tubewell. The tenders made 100 rounds to bring the situation under control. The operation lasted for more than five hours,” said Sharma.
 
 No one was injured in the incident.
