NOIDA: With   from parents who have been fighting against collection of “arbitrary charges” by  , the district inspector of schools (DIOS) has issued a “final notice” to the school, warning the school against legal action if it does not stop charging the annual fee.

 In the notice, he has said that if, in future, any other complaint of this sort comes to notice, a legal action will be taken against the school.
 
 It has also been brought to notice that the school is not accepting fees if someone does not pay the “annual charges”, it says, adding, that the school is being warned about collection of fee in a rational manner.
 
 The DIOS has further directed the school to “adjust” the  , which have already been paid by most of the parents. Parents of some of the students, who have been spearheading the campaign, have still not submitted the fees of their wards.
 
 “You are being directed for the last time that you should abide by the directions of the joint director education (Meerut) and apart from the usual charges, extra annual charges should not be collected from them,” says the letter.
 
 This is the fourth such letter from a higher authority to the school. While two notices have been sent to the school by the joint director education (Meerut), one has been sent by the CBSE and the latest has been sent by the DIOS on Friday.
 
 Sivananad Raja, representative of management committee of DPS 132, told TOI that he would not be able to respond to any query for the next 10 days due to the demise of his mother.
 
 Indira Kohli, Principal, DPS 132 did not respond to frequent calls and a message.
 
 A group of parents had protested against the increase in annual charges, tution fee and technology fee by 14% from April 1, levelled by the school citing the introduction of 7th pay commission by the central government. On July 5 and in April, the parents protested the hike as per the 7th pay commission, terming it unjustified and absurd.
