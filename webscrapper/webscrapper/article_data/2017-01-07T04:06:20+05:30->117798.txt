GURUGRAM:   owners came up with the term ‘Gair Mumkin farmhouse’, or farmhouse on uncultivable land, on Thursday during a National Green Tribunal hearing against them for eating up the   in Raisina village in Sohna.

 The green court was hearing the plea of Haryali (an NGO) vs. State of Haryana and others and Sonia Ghosh vs. State of Haryana and others . Both pleas are against alleged encroachment by farmhouses in Raisina village, located in Sohna tehsil of Gurgaon. These cases have been going on for over three years now. 
 
 The farmhouse owners said their farmhouses were constructed on land classified as ‘Gair Mumkin farmhouses’ and they had acquired permission to carry out construction way back in the 1990s. “We have documents that mention the area as ‘Gair Mumkin farmhouse’. Therefore, the constructions cannot be razed,” said a farmhouse owner, requesting anonymity. 
 
 Environmentalists, on the other hand, ridiculed the defendants’ argument. “‘Gair Mumkin’ refers to uncultivable waste land, while ‘farmhouse’ refers to cultivable area. How can a term have two contradictory words? In one of the judgments of the Punjab and Haryana high court in 2012, the court made it absolutely clear that if patwari (revenue officer) coins a term which is not mentioned in the law, it will be considered null and void,” said Chetan Agarwal, an environmentalist.
 
 Jitender Bhadana, another environmentalist, said there was a need to give forest status to the Aravalis. “All such terms will keep coming up unless   hills are given the forest status.”
 
 The area falls under the Aravali notification and is protected under the Environment Protection Act, 1992. Construction is not permitted in ‘Gair Mumkin Pahar’(uncultivable land). 
 
 The   set February 15 for next hearing.
