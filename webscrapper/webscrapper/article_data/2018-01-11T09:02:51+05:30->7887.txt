HYDERABAD:   education minister, Kadiyam  , on Wednesday said students studying in   schools are as talented as those in corporate institutions. 

 Speaking at the inaugural of the sports meet of Gurukul schools at   stadium, he said, "Whenever given an opportunity, students from economically and socially backward families always prove that they are no less than anyone else."
 
  "The government, on average, is spending about 1 lakh on each student. That is the reason why facilities in government schools are better than those in corporate or international schools," the minister added. 
 
 "In Telangana, there are 546 Gurukul schools and 194 model schools, where about 8 lakh students pursue their education. Now, we are in the process of filling up 8,000 vacant teacher posts in these institutes," Srihari said appealing to all students to use these facilities and excel in studies. 
 
 A total of 2,000 students belonging to five societies run by the state government are taking part in this programme.
