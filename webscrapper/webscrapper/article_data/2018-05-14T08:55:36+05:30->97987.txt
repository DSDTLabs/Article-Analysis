 Of them, the forest department has been able to collect 20 species from  , Dhar, Alirajpur, Hoshangabad and Bhopal. At the nursery of Indore, 20 to 40 plants of each variety are being developed under controlled circumstances. 
 
 “It has taken us six months to collect these 20 species. Ten more are yet to be collected and for that we are planning to travel to Chitrakoot’s forest, where we can find their seeds,” SDO (research and extension) Ashok Awasthi said. 
 
 The forest officers were given a manual by the BSI containing the detailed description of each of variety of the ficus, including technical specifications of its leaves, bark, flowers, etc. The project is being carried out only at Indore’s nursery with the funds provided by the BSI. 
 
 Paras peepal, peepal, and banyan trees are the species of ficus which are easily available in Indore and surrounding areas. Another variety of ficus being cultivated at the nursery here is called Ficus Krishnae in scientific terminology and Krishna vat or makhan katori in local dialect. 
 
 The leaves of this plant are large shaped and are curved in such a manner that they resemble a bowl. According to folklore, Lord Krishna ate butter in this plant’s leaf hence, its scientific name too was kept Ficus Krishnae.
