Blondie front woman   has heaped praise on   after she wrote a song for the band's latest record 'Pollinator'. 

  
  
 The veteran singer called the 'Boom Clap' hitmaker, who penned 'Gravity' for the band's latest album, an outstanding songwriter. "She's a virtual genius. She told me she wrote 'Gravity' when she was 15 - honey, when I was 15, I could only dream of writing a song like that."
 
 "But she's really got something. When you listen to her lyrics, it's clear she's been exposed to some really interesting literature. She has a frame of reference that's very large - which is either because she's read a lot or she's had many different lives, which is a nice possibility," Harry said.
