AHMEDABAD: Vadaj police investigating the murder of an   firm employee with robbery outside   on Friday morning have found the bike used in the incident abandoned on   road.

 Investigators put the estimate of the valuables robbed between Rs 35 lakh and Rs 50 lakh. The figure might rise with the valuation of diamonds. The bag robbed contained diamonds, pearl sets and gold jewellery according to information received so far.
 
 
 On Friday morning, four bike-borne assailants targeted a group of angadia firm employees waiting for a North Gujarat-bound bus at about 7.14am and fired two rounds in air. As people started running for cover, the robbers tried to snatch a bag held by Arvind Patel, 51, a Siddhpur resident and working with Patel  . When Patel refused to let the bag go, one of the assailants shot Patel in his face and stomach. He died on the spot as the robbers zoomed off on two bikes in the direction of Usmanpura.
 
 “The bike was found abandoned on side of the road. The same bike was found in a few CCTV footages. When we traced its owner, we found that Bharat Prajapati, a resident of Meghaninagar, had reported the bike missing on March 15, a day before the incident. With the discovery, it is apparent that the accused used more than two vehicles and there might be more than four persons involved. A vehicle, seen on CCTV a few feet away from the spot, is also under the scanner,” said an investigator.
 
 Investigators said that they are working on the possibility that someone had tipped off the accused about the contents of Patel’s bag due to which he was targeted specifically. “CCTVs of a very large area are under scanner by the city police and crime branch team to get possible leads,” said an official. While speculations were rife about three persons apprehended by city police in connection with the case, officials said investigation is still on.
