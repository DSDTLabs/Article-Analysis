KANPUR : Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Rajya Sabha MP  , on Saturday, said he was confused why jailed Bahujan Samaj Party MLA Mukhtar Ansari was not allowed to vote in the 10th UP  , when he was allowed to exercise the same right during the Presidential elections last year.

 Alleging that the Bharatiya Janata Party had won the RS elections on the basis of money and muscle power, Singh said,
 
 
 “Hindu and Muslims had become more bitter towards each other, ever since Yogi Adityanath took charge of the state.CM Yogi had made Uttar Pradesh a ‘rogi’ (ill) in the last one year.”
 
 Addressing media in the city on Saturday, Singh alleged that the   had acted acting like an agent of BJP during the RS polls and its officials (EC) had declared invalid votes as valid to benefit the party.
 
 He cited the example of Kanpur  , conducted last year, wherein he claimed that when voters were pressing the EVM button to vote for BSP, the vote was getting transferred to BJP candidate.
