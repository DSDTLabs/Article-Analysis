MUMBAI: The Mumbai Port Trust, established in 1879 to carry out port operations on the city’s eastern  , has been appointed as the special   authority (SPA) for the area spread over 2,388 acres or 966.3 hectares.

 Of this, MbPT owns 2,300 acres. The notification for appointing MbPT as the SPA was issued on April 23. With the publication of the notification, the BMC ceases to be the planning authority for the area.
 
 
  
 The MbPT area extends from   to Wadala and includes Sasoon Dock, Mody Bay,   and Docks, Princess Dock, Frere land and   in Mazagaon, MbPT quarters in Santa Cruz, Parel, Sewree, Wadala, Raoli Junction in Matunga.
 
 MbPT does not own 87 acres of the land for which it is appointed SPA, inlcuding Sasoon Dock in Colaba, Ballard Estate, Princess Dock, Sewree, Wadala and Mazagaon Tank Bunder. 
 
 Sanjay Bhatia, chairman, MbPT, said the port trust already has a master plan ready. “We will now prepare detailed plans, invite suggestions and objections and submit them to the state government for its approval. Till our development plan is finalized, the BMC’s development plan will apply but we shall approve our building proposals,” he said.
 
 Asked if MbPT had a town planning department, Bhatia said they are in the process of setting up one. He said the domestic cruise project is done, international cruise terminal is underway as also modernization of Sasoon Dock. Besides, there are plans to redevelop dilapidated areas such as Haji Bunder. Those whose leases have expired will be asked to shift and the area developed into gardens. Bhatia said while Ballard Estate will remain untouched as it is “very pretty”, the authority will draw up new rules for lease. The rent will be linked to market value and lease period may be 30-60 years. Architect Manoj Daisaria said the land owner and approving authority being the same is a good proposition like in case of Cidco.
