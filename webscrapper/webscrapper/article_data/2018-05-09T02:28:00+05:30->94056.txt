Visakhapatnam: Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) have taken immediate action by placing   blocks over the open drain in front of a residential complex in   gardens near the Old Jail Road junction after the issue was reported in TOI on April 28.

 It had emerged as a matter of concern, as there were instances when children fell into it and vehicles got stuck in the open drain. 
 
 Residents of the colony said it was dangerous especially for the people who were caught unaware.
 
 Speaking to TOI after the completion of work, Zone III commissioner Chitti Babu, said, “After a quick inspection, the staff concerned from the engineering and the Underground Drainage (UGD) department were entrusted with the work.” Keeping in view the safety of pedestrians, commuters and residents, the commissioner added, “An action was taken on an emergency basis due to the mishaps that had happened recently and the complaints which were lodged by the people.”
 
 Suresh Betha, a legal consultant, who lives in an apartment beside which the open drain is located said, “The drain has been closed by placing concrete blocks. We are happy that the municipal authorities have finally solved our problem.”
 
 Stating that every time she had to caution her son when he ventured out, another resident, Veena B, said, “Since children frequently fell into the drain while playing, it was always worrisome to send him out to play. Now that the drain is closed, there is now no reason to fear.”
