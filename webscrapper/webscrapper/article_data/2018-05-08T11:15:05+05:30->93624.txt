In the latest episode of  , Padma rescues Adithya (in Surya’s disguise) the outsider (who accused Surya of misbehavior earlier) attacked him with a knife. In the due course, Padma is injured. Stunned by her risk, Adithya quickly nabs the person, who attacked him.
 
 Adithya gets concerned about Padma and provides her medical treatment. Seeing her bleed, Adithya turns emotional. For a moment he forgets that he is Adithya (seeking revenge against the family) and behaves like the elder brother of Surya. Showing his genuine concern, he instructs Padma to stay back with the family permanently (much against to his previous drama of sending her away). The family is quite happy about Surya’s sudden change in behaviour.
  
 In the next scene, it is revealed that the outsider (who tried to stab Adithya alias Surya) is actually hired by Samantha. Sam scolds him for the knife attack.
  
 Sam interrupts Adithya’s introspection. While Sam tries to remind Adithya his true nature, Adithya fumes with guilt and revenge.
  
 On the other hand, Samanya tries to convince Jayanthi that her wedding with Surya is the only way to solve the issues at home. Given his unpredictable behaviour of late, Samanya further provokes Jayanthi to talk to Surya about the wedding. Adithya (in Surya’s disguise) capitalises upon the opportunity and gives a final nod to the wedding. Samanya and Jayanthi rejoice at Surya’s decision.
  
 Sam points out Adithya the silly mistake he committed by giving his nod to marry Samanya. Sam thinks Adithya put his relationship with Samyu at stake. However, Adithya reminds Sam that it’s Surya, who is actually trapped. Sam pledges to stop this wedding.
