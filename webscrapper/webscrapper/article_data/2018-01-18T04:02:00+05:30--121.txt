Vadodara: A 60-year-old man was injured after a crocodile grabbed his leg at Shihor village in Padra on Wednesday afternoon. In another incident, an eight feet long crocodile was rescued near Ajwa reservoir.

 Bachu Rathodiya had taken out his three buffaloes for grazing in a farm when a crocodile, hiding in bushes, was about to pounce on one of the buffaloes. But before the reptile could attack, Rathodiya came in between and the crocodile grabbed his right leg. After struggling for some time, Rathodiya managed to get his leg released.
 
 Soon, locals gathered there and called 108 GVK-EMRI ambulance. Rathodiya was taken to a public health centre in Padra where he got three stitches.
 
 Volunteers of a wildlife NGO rescued an eight feet long crocodile near Ajwa reservoir. The crocodile was first sighted near water-filled pit by construction labourers working there a couple of days back. The volunteers asked the labourers to empty the pit so that the crocodile can go back to where it had come from. However, on Wednesday the reptile ventured into the area where the labourers have their temporary settlement.
 
 The rescuers reached there and then released it in the reservoir water.
