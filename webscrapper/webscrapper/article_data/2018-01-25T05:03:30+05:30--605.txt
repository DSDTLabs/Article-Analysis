MUMBAI: If all goes according to plan, there will be more space for commuters on AC trains. 

 The Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation ( ) plans to procure 47   under the   with more carrying capacity compared to the existing AC and regular 12-coach rakes. The extra space, equivalent to almost one coach, will be created due to design modification with underslung motorcoach equipment—below the  .
 
 “This means a 12-coach rake will carry the passenger load of a 13-coach without adding a coach,” said an MRVC official, adding that the estimated procurment cost of the 47 rakes or 564 coaches is Rs 3,500 crore. 
 
 The existing 12-car AC rakes can carry nearly 6,000 commuters. “With the design modification, the new trains will have 65-70 fewer seats, but the carrying capacity will increased by up to 500 passengers per train,” explained the official. “If the power equipment is fitted underslung, each train’s carrying capacity increases by 300 as per global standards and up to almost 500, if we consider that in Mumbai, commuters travel in super dense crush load (16 standees per sqm).” 
 
 Also, with the power equipment placed underslung, all coaches will be interconnected by vestibule and commuters will be able to move from one end of the train to another. “In the existing AC rakes, manufactured by Integral Coach Factory, a power coach is placed between the 12 compartments. So, only six coaches are interconnected.”
 
 MRVC has prepared the bid documents for the procurement of 47 AC rakes and will invite global tenders after the Research Design and Standards Organization of Indian Railway approves the specification of the AC rakes.
 
 MRVC also plans to have two categories of coaches, similar to those in the existing non-AC electric multiple unit rakes. “There may be Metro-type seating in second class coaches and the prevalent seating design in first class. A final call is yet to be taken,” said the MRVC official.
