The Government of   is set to introduce a ‘digital guide’ to delve into the history of landmarks in and around   by mid-February. Aided by a startup that specializes in augmented reality (AR), visitors can scan statues and buildings in the park to know about their history and significance, all on their smartphones. Speaking about the new feature, Minister of IT, BT and Tourism,  , says, “We wanted to develop an integrated app with features that marry technology and tourism, and this digital guide is one of them. Visitors often want to know about historic structures, and while guides provide info and a human touch, they are few in number. That gap can be filled with such technology, which will appeal to the younger generation.”

 
 Augmented reality, or AR, is a technology that superimposes computer-generated sensory inputs, such as sound, video, graphics on a user’s live view of the real world, thereby enhancing one’s 
 current perception of reality. AR seamlessly blends components of the digital world into a person’s perceived real world
 
 
 
 "Once logged on to the app, point your smartphone or tablet at a landmark to have information such as timeline, audio and video clips, photos and more open up. Currently, the technology works on only five statues and selected buildings," says  , founder of the startup.
