KOTTAYAM: Fr   who reached his native village after two years said that he was not just a member of the Uzhunnalil family or the Salesian Church anymore. "I belong to all," said the priest while addressing the gathering at the auditorium of the Bishop's House at  . "Special poojas were done for my release in the temples in Ramapuram and Muslim brothers prayed for me in mosques," he added.

 Though he appeared physically weak, Uzhunnalil did not allow anyone to help him to walk or climb steps. "I am perfectly fine. But I have lost weight as I am diabetic," he said.
 
 Earlier, Uzhunnalil was received by Mar Jacob Muricken, Auxiliary Bishop of the Pala Diocese and Mar Joseph Pallikkaparambil, former head of Pala diocese as he arrived at the Bishop's House around 3.20pm. Local MLA K M Mani presented the priest with a bouquet.CPM state secretariat member K J Thomas representing the state government was also present. He then visited the chapel of the Bishop's House, where a prayer service was held. Fr Tom recollected the day when he was ordained as a priest in the same chapel by   in 1990.
 
 Later, he went to his ancestral home to spend the night, where he was received by his elder brother   and sister Mary along with other relatives.
