HYDERABAD: While the entire city was rooting for Sunrisers Hyderabad to win the   in the last edition, residents in certain pockets of the city like LB Nagar and Malkajgiri were busy converting the euphoria into quick bucks through betting.

 Now, with IPL X all set to commence in April, officials of the   are busy gearing up to stop betting at any of these areas. Since the city's team was the winner last year,   that the betting amounts this year would touch the sky.
 
 “Earlier, cricket betting was limited to areas like Jubilee Hills and Banjara Hills. But the punters have learnt that these places are vulnerable to being raided by the police. Now, they have shifted their base to smaller residential pockets,“ special operations team inspector K Narsing Rao told TOI.
 
 However, residents of these areas say they were clueless that their areas had turned into hotbeds of cricket betting. “We were not even aware that there was a gambling racket in our area last year. It was on ly after the police raids that we got to know,“ said Tarnaka resident BT Srinivasan.
 
 In the previous season of the IPL, the police arrested 166 punters for organising cricket betting rings.
 
 “Over the last two weeks, we have placed digital traces on phones used by these punters. Now, we will be able intercept any call or message they get from their prospective customers to place a bet,“ said the inspector. Unlike the posh environs of   where the bets roll into lakhs of rupees, the bets placed in the suburbs are much smaller.
 
 “Usually, the bets placed in these areas range from Rs 500 to Rs 10,000. Now, the punters have begun using a cashless facility to ensure the secrecy of their patrons,“ he added.
