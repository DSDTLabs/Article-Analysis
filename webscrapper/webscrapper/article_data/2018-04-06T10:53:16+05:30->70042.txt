 Fire brigade deployed six fire engines and brought the fire under control after five hours struggle. The blaze started around 2 am on Friday. No casualty has been reported in the incident said fire official.
 
 Fire officials stated that they faced difficulties in firefighting operation, as the building was situated in congested lane and there were less distance between two buildings. Electric cables passing from one building to another without proper planning also created hurdle for firefighters.
