  When I realized that I was not respecting my body. My body was the reason I was alive and I was just neglecting that sole reason.
 
 
  1 whole egg, fresh fruits and whole wheat toast (with Nut butter)
 
 
  2 chapatis, a bowl full of veggies, curd, chicken/dal and salad.
 
 
  Same as lunch, but I eat less chapatis in my dinner. Sometimes, I prefer a bowl of healthy soup.
 
 
  Everything possible. I too have cheat days when I eat whatever I like. 
 
 
  Apart from gym (I never hit the gym) , I would keep rotating my workout after a month or two, so from   to   to  ! The only thing constant is my jogging routine. 
 
 
 Blend some cottage cheese with a bit of curd and strawberries (or any fruit), and drizzle one tablespoon of honey or a spoon of dry fruits! It satisfies sweet craving.
 
 
  Eat seasonal fruits and vegetables, like mangoes in summer, and oranges in winter. Also, exercise regularly to keep your body toned and healthy. 
 
 
  For me, working out has become a very important part of my life. As far as my diet is concerned, there was no drastic change and it was something I could maintain. Also, I have never felt this great before (my physical appearance and my health).
 
 
 Fitness should be a major part of your lifestyle. Staying fit should be the main priority. Also, be positive that you will lose extra kilos. Do not get disappointed as you may gain a few kgs. But do take good care of your body. Because it is rightly said that if love your body and it will love you back.
