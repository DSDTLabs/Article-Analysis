GANDHINAGAR: To further the gains accrued due to the   and alienation of the powerful community from the BJP in the recent assembly elections and 2015 local body elections,   president   on Saturday evening named 42-year-old young Patidar MLA from Amreli, Paresh  , as the leader of opposition (LOP) in the Gujarat assembly.

 Dhanani is a third-term MLA and is currently a working president of the Gujarat Congress. He emerged as the most preferred leader of the 77 MLAs of the party. Dhanani belongs to the strong Leuva Patel community of Saurashtra. He is known as a giantkiller, as the tender age of 26 in 2002, when there was major pro-BJP wave after the Godhra riots, he defeated former Gujarat BJP president and current Union minister Parshottam Rupala. Though Dhanani lost in 2007 to senior BJP leader Dilip Sanghani, but defeated Sanghani in 2012. In the 2017 polls, Dhanani again defeated Bavku Undhad, a powerful BJP leader who had also been in the Congress for a while.
 
  
  A former NSUI leader, Dhanani has served as secretary of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) and has wide experience of national politics.
 
 Dhanani, a farmer who is also associated with various social activities like blood donation drives, youth service, the diamond association etc., is most visible face in Amreli.
 
 Despite claims by senior MLAs like Kuvarji Bavaliya, Mohansinh Rathwa and, Vikram Madam, Rahul Gandhi chose the dynamic Dhanani to be LOP. Bharatsinh Solankisaid, “The party high command has chosen Pareshbhai Dhanani to be the youngest LOP of the state. I congratulated him. His wide experience as working president and AICC secretary, grassroots approach and experience in the assembly will help him raise the people’s issues in the house.”
