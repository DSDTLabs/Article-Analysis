BENGALURU: Parents of children enrolled in the   have begun two campaigns to gather more support and speed up police investigation.

 A parent has addressed a petition to police commissioner   on Change.org, demanding faster closure of the cases, an update on the action taken so far, the culprit's photo and a signed contract between parents and schools mentioning that the school is responsible for the kids' safety inside the premises. Within a day, the campaign has garnered support from 700-odd members.
 
 A   page Â­   -has also been created as a forum for parents to voice their opinions about the issue. Over 800 members have joined and are following the case developments.
 
 The barrage of complaints against the suspected paedophile is reminiscent of the spate of sexual assualts reported from school campuses in 2014. Three years ago, police responded by coming up with a series of guidelines to secure children on campus.
