I exercised my right to franchise for the first time at the last BBMP  . It felt truly empowering that you could be instrumental in electing the people who will bring about a change. I am quite excited about   for the   elections. This time, nearly one-fourth of the voters in Karnataka are apparently first timers, which is a big number and goes to show the power the youth has in bringing about a change.
The unfortunate part is that not many actually take it seriously and head out to vote. At the   election, most of the other voters I saw were elderly. Enrolling your name on the electoral list is easy as long as you have an Aadhar card. But then people refuse to make that effort. They will spend days together comparing specifications and price bands before investing on a smartphone, but will not take a fraction of that time on figuring out the credentials of the candidates contesting and voting for the right person. Everyone really needs to invest a few minutes to safeguard the next five years. We need to be motivated to vote right. Let us not vote on the basis of a party, caste, creed, gender or any other such reason. With elections, we   candidates to take decisions on our behalf in the assembly. Often, they donâ€™t live up to it, which is frustrating. But hopefully it will drive the youth towards revolutionising the whole system to work towards a better tomorrow. For now, nominations have been filed and we should do the needful by voting. You could vote for a person, or not approve of anyone with a NOTA. The choice is yours, but you have to make that choice.
