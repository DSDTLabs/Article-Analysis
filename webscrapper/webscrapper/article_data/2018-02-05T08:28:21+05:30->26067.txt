CENTURION: The South Africans have been hopping in and out of the ground in the One-day series so far here like frogs in fresh monsoon. Their batting coach   summed it up best when asked what do you need to do to get your guys to play this kind of spin better?

 
 “It’s very difficult, unless we call them (Chahal and Yadav) to our net practice,” the coach said.
 
 
  
 
 
 South Africa’s two spinners Imran Tahir and Tabraiz Shamsi – both use wrists – have found neither the right pace nor the lengths to bowl on these wickets. “They’re obviously quicker in the air. These guys (Indian spinners) are a lot slower,” he said, pointing out the difference.
 
 It hasn’t been about South Africa’s inability to pick wickets as much as their inability to put runs on the board – and that would mean countering Chahal and Yadav – that’s got them into a quandary here.
 
 
  
 
 
 On that front, Benkenstein says it’s time to do something different in the nets. “We’ve got a few bowlers in the nets who bowl a lot slower. Justin Ontong (offie) being one of them,” he says, acknowledging his batsmen will have to spend a lot more time waiting for the ball to come on to the bat and it’ll have to start with the very next net session.
 
 The batting coach says he’s pretty amazed at how slow can the Indians bowl and the slower you bowl, the better are the chances for turn. “Obviously, if you’re a wrist spinner and you bowl slow, then it turns on any surface. But I think because of the slowness, there are also scoring opportunities. We need to look at that than just plodding around,” says Benkenstein.
 
 But, so far, that’s been better said than done. With Faf du Plessis and   missing, this South African line-up has found itself completely out of place and out of sync with the style of play they need to adapt here.
