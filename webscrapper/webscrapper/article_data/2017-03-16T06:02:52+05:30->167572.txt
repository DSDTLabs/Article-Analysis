NOIDA: The   has written one more letter to all ARTOs, clarifying that e-rickshaws do not require permits, but need to be registered with the local transport department. The letter also cites the amendment made in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 in October last year for the same.

 According to transport commissioner  , the first letter clarifying that e-rickshaws did not require permits was issued in August last year. “The amendment has exempted e-rickshaws and e-carts from permit requirements. However, these vehicles need to be registered with the local transport department. The vehicle should also be insured and the driver must have a valid driving licence,” Naik told TOI.
 
 He said that the local traffic police/transport department/administration may also impose reasonable restrictions on the movement of these vehicles, depending on the requirements.
 
 There are nearly 2,400 e-rickshaws plying in  , which often cause traffic congestions on routes not designated to them.
 
 Bharatiya Micro Credit (BMC) had decided to roll out 5,100 e-rickshaws in the NCR region in April 2005, including 1,000 in Noida.
 
 Vijay Pandey, managing director, BMC, said that the company had financed 937 e-rickshaws for Noida. “Earlier, we faced a lot of difficulties for registration and permits of the rickshaws. The government then relaxed the norms. We feel that with the change of power in Uttar Pradesh, the work will be further expedited,” he said.
