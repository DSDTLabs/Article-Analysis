TRICHY: The management of the   in   on Monday denied rumours on social media platforms that nuns from   had read the Bible and said their prayers on the temple premises. The management appealed to the public not to fall prey to the fake propaganda maligning the reputation and integrity of the temple.

 The temple management said on May 9, a group of nuns wearing habits visited the Thousand Pillar Mandapam (hall) on the temple premises, as a part of their tour. While the visitors were strolling between the open ground and the stone hall, a section of locals took pictures of them.
 
 Some locals, who are members of a right-wing group, approached the temple management alleging that the nuns were reading the Bible and saying their prayers. Apparently to pacify them, the temple management requested the visitors to leave the premises. The nuns immediately left the temple premises. However, according to the management, a volley of misguiding posts and rumours were floated on social media platforms for the past few days. 
 
 “The Thousand Pillar Mandapam is not a restricted zone and the allegation that visitors had prayed inside the temple was baseless and untrue. Hundreds of tourists belonging to different faiths visit the temple daily to admire its rich architecture. But such fake propaganda by people with vested interests will affect the temple’s reputation,” HR&CE (Hindu religious and charitable endowments department) joint commissioner of the temple, P   told TOI.
 
 According to him, lots of foreign tourists have been visiting the temple after it received the Unesco award in November 2017. tnn
