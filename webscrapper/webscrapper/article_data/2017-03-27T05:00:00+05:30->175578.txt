Tollywood star   was the star attraction at a walk held to spread awareness on   on Saturday. The ‘Endomarch’ held at   saw women of all ages come out and bat for the ending of stigma when it comes to women health related issues. Speaking at the event, Rakul said, “We need to change the culture of silence around women’s health issues. Girls don’t even talk about menstruation openly. We need to start by having dialogues and removing stigma around women’s bodies and reproductive health, so that women are empowered to address grave health conditions like endometriosis. So, we need to send out the message to all the girls out there ‘Please don’t shy away from addressing your health issues’.”
