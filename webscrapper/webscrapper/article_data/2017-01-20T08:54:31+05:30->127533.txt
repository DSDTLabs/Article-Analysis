BHOPAL: After an FIR was filed against 400   workers in the wake of an agitation on January 16, district party president   said thousands of cases have been registered against party workers in last five year. 

 Congress is also mulling to move court after   refused to lodge an FIR against the cops, who injured state party president. "Congress workers staged demonstration after permission was taken from the district administration. Policemen attacked   Arun Yadav on his head. We went to register the FIR at Habibganj police station, but the police made us accused," Sharma said.
 
 This did not happen for the first time. In past five years, the government has been perpetrating atrocities on Congress workers, he said. Most of the time the police book Congressmen under sections of rioting and obstructing work of government servant. Many times, cases of attacking a cop are also added, Sharma said.
