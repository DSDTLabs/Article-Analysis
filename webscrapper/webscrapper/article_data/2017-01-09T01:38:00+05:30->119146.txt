MUMBAI: Citizens were inconvenienced due to mega blocks on   (CR) Main and Harbour lines on Sunday.

 Due to the work on the Kharegaon road overbridge, a mega block was carried out between Thane and Kalyan on the Up and Down slow lines from 11.20am to 4.20pm. “This led to chaos at Thane station as there was a huge rush of passengers for CST-bound trains. Besides, commuters from Kalwa too came to Thane station to catch trains,” said a commuter.
 
 Due to the block the Down slow services were not available at Kalwa, Mumbra, Kopar and Thakurli and Up slow services were not operational at Mumbra and Kalwa stations. Commuters from these stations had to face hardships as they had to travel to Thane, Diva/Dombivli to catch trains.
 
 A senior railway official said that commuters were warned about the mega block a day in advance and requested to make travel plans accordingly.
 
 On  , the platforms 1 and 2 at CST witnessed scores of passengers waiting for the trains to arrive in the evening.
