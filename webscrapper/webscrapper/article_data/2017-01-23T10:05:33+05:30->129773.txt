Siddharth, is a dentist and entrepreneur, winner of ‘Entrepreneur Dentist’ of the Year Award for three consecutive years and owner of four patents in technology development in dentistry.
 
 He said that ‘Hellodoc’ is currently generating high volumes in terms of number of callers for medical consultation. Since its inception in August 2016, it has been consistently receiving 2,000 plus calls per month and currently, it has collaborated with four hospitals in the country.
 
 He added that creating a sustainable model has been a challenge for many players in similar domain, and a very important reason why the team has not jumped onto the health app right away. The team that comprises of 10 software engineers/developers is working on technology development parallel. However, the main focus is generating calls on the helpline and customer acquisition.
