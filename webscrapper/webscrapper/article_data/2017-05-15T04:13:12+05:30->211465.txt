AHMEDABAD: During the meeting of their IT cell, Congress leaders called upon the party’s cyber army to take on BJP on social media. They told members of their IT cell to create awareness among people about education qualifications and   of their opponents.

 Congress leaders including   president   and Sonia Gandhi’s political advisor, Ahmed Patel, said that the party does not need funds as BJP does to create a hyped up image in the social media using hired professionals.
 
 Congress’s IT cell members were told they should attack the   and also break the popular myths of development in Gujarat and those about the BJP leaders. 
 
 “We have more information about the BJP than any professional, and hence the cyber army should use their creativity and attack the BJP and expose not only the state government but even Prime Minister  ,” said Solanki. The Congress leaders said that BJP has roped in 10,000 youths for social media and hence the Congress, too, should increase its strength. The leaders demanded that whatever expense the party incurred for the election campaign, around 50% of the election fund should be allocated for social media.
 
 Ahmed Patel, who was present in the meeting, said that the Congress instead of adopting negative campaign, should resort to positive campaign and should be cautious in replies on the social media. Opponents are just out to post whatever they get without even verifying facts, he said.
