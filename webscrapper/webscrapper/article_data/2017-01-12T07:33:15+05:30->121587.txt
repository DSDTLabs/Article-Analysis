MUMBAI: Twenty-one years after Mumbai rocked to  , the Bombay high court has struck down the state government's demand for more than Rs 89 lakh as entertainment duty from the show organizer and National Association for the Blind (NAB).

 The American rock band, led by its lead singer Jon Bon Jovi, had performed at   on April 26, 1995. Proceeds of the charity show were to benefit NAB.The government first exempted the organizers from paying entertainment duty, then revoked the exemption after the show.
 
 A division bench of Justice   and Justice   noted that the exemption was “abruptly“ revoked without giving any show-cause notice, hearing or any reason. “This action is against the basic principles of natural justice... Allegations of misrepresentation or fraud, if any, itself require due show-cause notice with speci fic particulars and its details.There was no such communication prior in point of time,“ said the judges. “It is difficult for any organizer to recover such duty and surcharge from any consumer or audience, once the tickets are sold, on the basis of exemption already granted.“ After the show, the organi zers wrote to the Mumbai top cop, seeking a probe as some people had entered the venue without tickets or with forged tickets. On May 9, 1995, the government withdrew the exemption and in August ordered that Rs 89.92 lakh be recovered from the organizer and NAB. The matter recently came up for final hearing and the HC ruled that there was “no case to recover the amount or demand it after the show“.
