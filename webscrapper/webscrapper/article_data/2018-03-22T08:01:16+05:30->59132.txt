KOLKATA: The city will play host to a drama that seeks to connect science and storytelling in a unique way. Based on the life of Nobel laureate  , the play — ‘The Square root of a Sonnet’ — depicts his journey in science and also explains black holes through an audio-visual segment.

 ‘The Square Root of a Sonnet’ is written by Nilanjan Choudhury and directed by National award-winning film and theatre personality  . It explores the dramatic events that accompanied the discovery of collapsing stars (that ultimately form black holes).
 
 “The play revolves around Chandrasekhar who is among the not so wellknown heroes. He is one of the greatest scientists. At 30, he had stumbled upon the notion of a collapsing star which eventually led to the discovery of black holes. But he got recognition for it much later as his work was suppressed by his mentor   – the famous Cambridge scientist,” Choudhury said.
 
 It combines human and scientific elements, he said. “The play has four characters – Chandra, his wife Lalitha, Eddington and his sister. But the other aspect of the play is a 30-minute segment that explains black holes. It uses a video demonstration to explain these that should get every youngster interested in science,” choudhury added.
 
 The play is being performed in collaboration with IISER Kolkata and Centre for Excellence in Space Sciences India. It comes to Kolkata after successful shows before in Bangalore, Delhi, Pune and Mumbai.
