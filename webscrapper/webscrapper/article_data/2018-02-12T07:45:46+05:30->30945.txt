PATNA: Leader of opposition in state Assembly   on Sunday claimed his party would sweep Araria   seat as well as Jehanabad and   seats in the upcoming byelections. However, Tejashwi, while addressing mediapersons at Baisi on the second day of his ‘Nyay Yatra’, said the party would hold talks with its ally Congress before finalising the candidate for the   Assembly seat. The Congress is keen to contest the seat.

 Training his guns on CM  , the former deputy CM said, “Nitishji used to say he will be grounded to the dust, but never join hands with BJP. Since he has gone to BJP now, when will he be grounded to the dust?” “Nitish’s partymen had challenged me to declare my property during my Yatra. You (people) are my property,” Tejashwi told the people who had gathered at the public meeting at Baisi. TNN
