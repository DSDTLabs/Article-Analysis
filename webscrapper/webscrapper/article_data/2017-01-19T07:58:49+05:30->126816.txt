JAIPUR: Rajasthan has made significant progress in learning outcomes—reading, comprehension and arithmetic—in   compared to 2014, says the Annual   (ASER), which was   on Wednesday. The child-centric methods, structural and managerial changes by the education department seem to have yielded positive changes in learning outcomes.

 Figures state that children in Class V, who can read Class II-level textbooks, have gone up by 7.2% to 54% from the 2014 level.
 
 As per overall assessment, reading and comprehension levels in Rajasthan are better than the national average. However, mathematics continues to be a serious challenge despite showing some improvement.
 
 Math education needs to be a more focused effort. The report has also revealed that learning outcomes in government schools have fared better than private schools.
 
 The data has also shown major improvements in reading levels. Children in Class V, who can read Class II textbooks, jumped from 46.6% in 2014 to 54.1% in 2016. The national average for the same remains at 47.8%.
 
 Similarly, children in Class VIII, who can read simple sentences in English, jumped from 42.6% in 2014 to 43.4%in 2016, which is close to the national average of 45.2%.
 
 Class I students have also shown marginal improvement in reading, at least letters, from 2014. However, it was way below the national average.
 
 The state has also faced challenges when it comes to learning levels in mathematics. The report proved it again. While the state as such has shown improvement, it is below the national average in various categories.
 
 As per the data, children in Class V, who can solve a (3 digit by 1 digit) division problem jumped from 23.6% in 2014 to 28.2% in 2016, which is slightly above the national average of 25.9%. Similarly, children in Class 1, who can at least recognize digits 1-9, jumped from 44.3% in 2014 to 46.8%, which is quite below the national average of 60.1%. On the day of the visit in 2016, average attendance of children in upper primary schools in Rajasthan is 71.8%. This has increased from 68.6% in 2014, while the all-India average is 73.2%.
 
 K B Kothari, managing trustee of Pratham, Rajasthan Chapter, which carried out ASER survey, states that “the mergers of schools, staffing pattern and teachers’ accountability measures, introduced in the last two years, have made the difference”. On the positive aspect of merging schools, the report said that it has helped to channelize human resources in a better way.
 
 “The staffing pattern provides flexibility to bring in more teachers to schools where it is required,” said Kothari. Interestingly, the state has introduced several reforms, with one on transferring teachers on the basis of their performance. The teachers’ performance is being evaluated on the basis of results.
