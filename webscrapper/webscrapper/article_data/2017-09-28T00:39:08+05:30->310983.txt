Namakkal:   staged a   in front of the revenue divisional officer’s (RDO) office in Tiruchengode here on Wednesday, urging officials to fix minimum support price for the crop and also clear previous dues.

 The farmers, who came to the protest site holding sugarcane stems, alleged that private sugar companies hadn’t paid them according to the state advised price and they had to pay them arrears for more than three years.
 
 Last year, the state advised price was around Rs 2,430 per tonne. “But, the farmers were given only Rs 2,300 per tonne,” Nalla Gounder, secretary, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers’ Association, said.
 
 “We had urged the private sugar company authorities to clear the dues. But, they haven’t so far paid heed to our pleas,” he said. Nalla Gounder said the sugar companies across the state owe the farmers Rs 1,060 crore. The farmers also threatened to stage sit-in in front of all the sugar companies if they failed to fulfil their demands. “This year, we want the government to fix the prices considering our plight,” they said.
 
 Farmers from Erode, Pallipalayam, Sankari and Veppadai participated in the protest.
