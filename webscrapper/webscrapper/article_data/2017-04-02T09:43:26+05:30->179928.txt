SURAT: Around 139 wine shops and restaurants in Dadra and   (DNH) and in Daman — both union territories — have stopped serving liquor from April 1. This is in compliance with the Supreme Court order banning sale of liquor within 500 meters of the state and national highways from the first of this month.

 Daman has 500 liquor outlets while DNH has 200. Sources said that Daman’s excise department had served notice on such wine shops and restaurants after the Supreme Court order.
 
 Excise officials had carried out a survey at Zari, Baman Puja and Pataliya which are close to the national and state highways in Daman. They had identified around 88 wine shops, bars and restaurants for closure and non-renewal of liquor licenses after March 31, 2017. 
 
 Sources said that Pataliya has around 30 wine shops and restaurants. It is very is very popular with tourists and liquor-lovers from Surat who arrive during weekends. In DNH, 51 wine shops, bars and hotels serving liquor will have to close. “This will cause huge unemployment here,” said Pramod Tandel, owner of a wine shop in Daman.
