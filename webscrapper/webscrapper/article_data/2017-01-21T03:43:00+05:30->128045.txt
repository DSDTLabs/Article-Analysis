Margao:   parishioners proudly celebrated the feast of the first Goan saint, St Joseph Vaz, on Monday, with a statue dedicated to him. The statue was inaugurated by ‘miracle baby’ Fr Cosme Costa, sfx, in the courtyard of Our Lady of Hope Church.

 Before he blessed the life-sized statue, Costa narrated to the audience how his mother sought the intercession of the holy priest, Fr Vaz, when she was informed by the doctors that neither her baby nor she would survive. 
 
 “Yet, I’m alive and have been in the priestly ministry for over 50 years, for which I am grateful to the almighty,” said Fr Costa, as he acknowledged his birth being a miracle of St Vaz.
 
 “The statue has been procured from Hubli. But Marcus D’Melo, from 2nd Pavlem ward, has designed the laterite pedestal with various incidents of St Vaz’s life depicted on azulejo tiles on its four sides,” a Chinchinim resident, Roland D’Melo, told TOI.
 
 Also present were Chinchinim parish priest Fr Jose Antonio Costa, assistant parish priests Fr Stifan Rebello, Fr Clifford Castelino and Fr Querobino Baptista.
