They say everything is fair in love and war. That stands true in the deadliest season of   as well but cheating to win a war is not something that these Roadies practice.
 
  In the upcoming episode of   Roadies Rising, honesty will be displayed in a task which will make you respect these warriors even more. In an immunity challenge,   from Nikhil’s gang will be up against   from Neha’s gang. Both will be seen putting their 100% to win immunity.
  
  The task required them to hit at each other while being blind folded and listening to their gang leaders instructions. Mid-way through the task, Priyank shouted ‘Stop, Stop’! He later revealed that his eye mask had come off and that he could see from the corner of his eye.
  
  This act of morality resulted in him being applauded by everyone including the gang leaders.
  
    said, “People will forget who wins or loses the task, but they will always remember a person with a good character.”
