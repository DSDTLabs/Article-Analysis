CHANDIGARH: Though the Punjab   president and   MP   on Thursday submitted a memorandum to the governor seeking constitution of an SIT to probe the April 13 Phagwara clashes and subsequent violence between two communities, he remained tight lipped about Shiv Sena workers’ role in the violence.

 Questioned by the media about Shiv Sena’s role, he replied, “You ask it from Shiv Sena. It is not our alliance partner. Law and order is equal to all.” He added that   was part of a larger political conspiracy to incite sectarian violence ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
 
 It was on April 15 that the Phagwara police had arrested state vice president of Shiv Sena ( ) Inderjit Karwal, national president of Hindu Shiv Sena Shivi Batta, Bhartiya Janta Yuva Morcha leader Rajiv Chahal and state president of Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Suraksha Samiti Deepak Bhardwaj. They were sent to 14-day judicial remand by the court. Arms licences issued to all these Hindu outfit leaders were also cancelled.
 
 In the memorandum submitted by Malik and other Punjab BJP leaders, they have asked the governor to issue a directive to thePunjab chief minister to call an all-party meeting to deliberate joint initiatives for establishing peace in the society. The delegation said the local police were not probing political conspiracy angle and were only limited to the incidents of violence. Malik said there was political conspiracy to incite caste or section-based clashes to polarize voters for next year Lok Sabha elections.
 
 Other who accompanied Malik o meet the governor, included former state BJP president Rajinder Bhandari and Ashwani Sharma, general secretary (organization) Dinesh Kumar, state party general secretaries Jeewan Gupta and Kewal Kumar and state party secretaries, Vineet Joshi and Subhash Sharma.
