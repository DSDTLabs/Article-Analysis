Ludhiana: Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) organised a two-day training program on achieving excellence through Statistical Process Control (SPC) at its office in Focal Point. 

 Speaking on the occasion, president of CICU Upkar Singh Ahuja said, “CICU has been organising various programs for the benefit of the industry and trade sectors of Punjab. Skill upgradation of the industrial employees is one of the key agendas under the Make In India initiative by the government and facilitated by our association. There is a dire need for the upgradation of the industry in terms of manufacturing and production practices and especially in Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). 
 
 For global competition, achieving excellence in manufacturing has become very important and plays a vital role, Ahuja said. He added, “There is a direct co-relation between skill upgradation of employees and key performance indicators (KPI) of the business. In this program, participants will learn about practical knowledge of using statistical methods in analysing production, service processes, to pave the path towards achieving excellence.”
