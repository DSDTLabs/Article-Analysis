NAGPUR:   continues to rely heavily on government grants to fund its budget if one sees the financial data of the civic body.

 According to figures procured from  , over 61% of the income of Nagpur Municipal Corporation in 2016-17 came from state government while 39% of their income came from local taxes like property tax, water tax, market dues etc.
 
 Revenue from local taxes are much lower in the Maharashtra than in many other civic bodies like Pune, Thane and Nashik.
 
 According to analysis of last eight years income of the NMC, in 2009-2010, the civic body had generated a revenue of 79% from own sources, while it received 21% revenue from the governments as grants. The figure was almost similar in the next financial year (2010-2011).
 
 Sources said the dependency of NMC on government funds increased since 2013-14 when the Congress led   scrapped octroi and replaced it with local body tax. The changeover had started deteriorating the NMC’s revenue. Though in transition period, the NMC had contributed 66% revenue from its sources, while availed 34% financial aids from the governments (both central and state).
 
 This study was based on annual budgets of NMC. It may be noted that the city has been in the Smart City Scheme of Central government.
 
 According to sources, review of data of NMC hints that during recent years dependence of the urban local body (ULB) on grants of Central and State government is showing an increasing trend. “This trend is a stumbling block in the path of proper functioning of the ULB,” admitted a senior civic official.
 
 Nagpur Municipal Corporation is yet to be financially self-sufficient and extensively depends on government grants rather than improving its own revenue, claimed a recent study made by the civic body itself.
 
 As per the findings of the study, during the year 2011-12, total income of NMC included 29% resources received as grant from both the central and state governments. During 2012-13, NMC had planned to decrease its grant from Central and State governments to 13% of its total income. It rose to 34% in 2013-14 and in 2015-16, the NMC’s revenue collection dipped below 50% and recorded 45% income from its various sources. In the same year, the NMC had relied on 55% governments’ grants. In 2016-17, the NMC had envisioned to get 61% of its total income from the State and Central governments.
 
 Standing committee chairman Sandip Jadhav admitted steep decline in NMC’s revenue and said his focus will be on improving revenue collection of the civic body.
