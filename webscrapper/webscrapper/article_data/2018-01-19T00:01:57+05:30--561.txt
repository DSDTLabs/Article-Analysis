 Nashik: The civic standing committee’s first term is coming to an end next month but the inquiry ordered by it against the encroachment officer is yet to conclude.
 
 The NMC had handed over outdoor advertising to a private company through tender. The agency owes Rs 1.5 crore to the civic body. The advertisers of most of the hoardings do not have the receipts for the tax paid, or the permission from the NMC to erect the hoardings. 
 
 In last June, the committee had come down heavily on encroachment officer RM Bahiram for alleged corruption in collecting hoarding fees and other taxes and the failure in bringing down illegal hoardings. The committee members alleged that hoarding tax was not collected for four years. They demanded suspension of Bahiram and Suresh Aher, assistant superintendent of the encroachment department, and an inquiry against them. 
 
 Soon, a panel comprising the chief internal auditor, additional municipal commissioner II and six standing committee members was set up to probe the allegations. The panel was directed to submit its report in three months but it has failed to do so.
 
 “We will be conducting hearings daily for the next few days. In two weeks we will submit the report to the standing committee,” said Mushir Sayyed, a standing committee member who is part of the inquiry panel.
 
 He blamed the delay on paperwork. There were hundreds of documents, Sayyed said.
 
 “Also, we called Bahiram for hearing a number of times and he too had many answers to our queries. There are 21 points and we are clearing them one by one. At present, the inquiry on Gharkul beneficiaries is under way,” Sayyed said.
