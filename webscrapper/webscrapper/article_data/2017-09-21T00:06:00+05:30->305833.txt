Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday directed the secretary of Tamil development and archaeology to file a counter to the case seeking to create necessary infrastructure and providing more Tamil works to the World Tamil Sangam in Madurai. 

 The division bench of justices M M Sundresh and N Sathishkumar gave this direction on a public interest litigation filed by advocate B Stalin of Melur.
 
 When the case came up for hearing, the petitioner’s counsel said the government inaugurated the World Tamil Sangam on March 1, 2016. However, there is no progress in the functioning of the sangam. Government’s objective with regard to development of Tamil and World Tamil Sangam is only on paper. No aims and objectives of the World Tamil Sangam were implemented in letter and spirit, the counsel said. 
 
 Integration of world Tamil organisations, sending scholars and artists to foreign countries to explain Tamil literature and culture, publishing encyclopedia about Tamils in foreign countries, setting up chairs (to conduct activities including to hold seminar) in the world universities and research centres, introducing sculpture, folk songs and cultural programmes to foreign Tamils and collecting palm leaf manuscripts, rare manuscripts and rare art crafts from various world museums are some of aims and objectives of the World Tamil Sangam, the counsel said. 
 
 Many foreigners are visiting the sangam with high expectations, but returning with disappointment. Building only exists, but no books are available at the sangam’s library. The government had already passed an order directing to provide one copy of each book given to public libraries in the state, to the sangam. But, it has not been done, the petitioner said. 
 
 Regarding this issue, a representation was sent to the chief secretary, Tamil development and archaeology secretary and Tamil development director on August 31, but no action was taken on it, the counsel said.
