CHANDIGARH: As the Chandigarh municipal corporation has sent the parking issue, mainly roll-back of hiked charges and cancelling of the parking contract; the UT administration is all set to take legal advice in the matter. The move is significant as the municipal councillors had unanimously rejected increase in charges in last monthly house meeting.

 
 “We will first go through all documents, passed resolution of the MC house and then after taking advice will file the reply,” sources in the Chandigarh administration said.
 
 As per information, besides resolution of the general house, the officers concerned of the civic body have also enclosed all legal documents, including copy of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the Chandigarh municipal corporation and the private company that has been managing the paid parking lots.
 
 “Since we have to make the UT administration aware regarding all aspects in the matter, we have provided every information to the officials concerned along with the resolution of the   so that every legal aspect can be minutely considered while taking a decision,” said an MC official.
 
 As joint municipal commissioner   issued orders to increase parking charges in the city from April 1, mayor   had asked the finance and contract committee (F&CC) of the civic body to inspect paid parking system and table the report in this regard.
 
 Also, five teams had been constituted to inspect the paid parking lots. The F&CC committee headed by former mayor   had criticized the paid parking contractor in the report saying that nothing had been done in the name of ‘smart’ paid parking and people had been financially burdened without getting any facilities there. Though the report revealed that there were some minor anomalies, largely all basic things were placed on the ground.
 
 On Monday, the F&CC had decided to bring up the parking issue again in the upcoming monthly house meeting where the municipal councillors will again discuss the issue to pass a resolution to annual the contract with the company by giving three months’ notice in advance
