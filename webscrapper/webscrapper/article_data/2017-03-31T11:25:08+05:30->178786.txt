Hiranpur (Pakur): With the minority community comprising a significant portion of the electorate of Littipara assembly constituency, chief minister   is leaving no stone unturned to woo community voters to secure the ballot of party candidate   in the by-election. 

 "JMM has always considered minorities and tribals to be its vote bank and succeeded but party leaders did nothing for their uplift," Das said, while addressing an election meeting at Hiranpur block headquarter on Thursday.
 
 The minorities, particularly the Muslims, comprise 20 percent of the electorate in Hiranpur block area of Littipara constituency and are known to be JMM supporters.
 
 "It is high time that our Muslim brothers and sisters reconsider their stand as JMM does not hesitate in hurting your religious sentiments by misappropriating government funds meant for Haj house in the state capital," Das said, pointing out instances of corruption in the construction of the Ranchi-based Haj house, which was built at the cost of Rs 9 crore during JMM's regime.
 
 Taking on then state minister for minority affairs Hazi Hussain Ansari, Das said the previous Haj house had to be demolished owing to poor quality construction and that the new one was on the anvil.
 
 "My government has allocated Rs 65.6 crore to construct the Haj house in Ranchi which will have all the modern facilities apart from various schemes meant for the development of the minority community members," the chief minister boasted, adding that none of those responsible for misappropriating the funds meant for Haj house would be spared including Hazi.
 
 Kamal Khan, state president of  's minority front, also came down heavily on JMM and said minorities had started realising the 'dubious' credentials of the   and other regional parties as evident from the recently held elections in the UP and other states.
 
 "None other than   was instrumental behind the Chirudih massacre in which minorities were made victims under the guise of anti-mahajani (money lending) movement launched by JMM in its earlier stage," Khan said.
