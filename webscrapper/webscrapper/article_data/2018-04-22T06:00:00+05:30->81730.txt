Recently a painting   and live painting session was organised in the city. Talented   of Nagpur got together and participated in two different segments of painting -   and  .

 There were a lot of passersby who stopped over to pose for live portrait painting efforts while different hues of nature were amazingly captured by those artists who breathed life in their work.
 
 We hope more such workshops are organised in future too, to motivate more artists to give their best
