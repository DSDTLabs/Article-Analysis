PATNA: The Bihar unit of CPI on Sunday welcomed the move of CM   for a joint struggle of all opposition parties, including the Left, against what it termed the ‘anti-people policies’ of the NDA government headed by PM Narendra Modi at the Centre.
 
  Nitish, who is also JD (U) national president, had called on CPI general secretary S Sudhakar Reddy in New Delhi on Friday. The Bihar CM also had an interaction with CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury during a function to release a book written by former Union finance minister  .
  
  “The CPI leaders had almost an hour-long discussion with JD (U) national president Nitish Kumar over various national political, social and economic issues. The two parties underlined the need for unleashing a joint struggle against the anti-people and anti-national policies of the BJP-led NDA government under Modi,” a CPI communiqué received from the party’s national headquarters, said.
  
  The other CPI leaders who participated in the discussion with Nitish included national council secretaries D Raja, Atul Kumar Anjaan and Amarjeet Kaur.
  
  Bihar CPI secretary   has welcomed the move of the party’s national leadership’s for a joint struggle with the JD (U). CPI state secretariat member Ram Babu Kumar said consultations would also be held with other political parties for the joint national struggle against the NDA government at the Centre.
  
  The last time Nitish had taken such an initiative was before the 2014 parliamentary elections, but it was for an anti-BJP and anti-Congress political formation, which did not come through. Also, the Left parties, including CPM, CPI, Forward Bloc and   (RSP), had been following an independent line on issues of importance.
  
  Indications are that the CPI(ML) might not be part of the emerging combine of the Left with Nitish and other political parties. CPI(ML) general secretary   will lead the party’s ‘anti-Nitish’ and ‘anti-Modi’ march in Bihar on February 19.
