BENGALURU: The past few years saw an explosion of new ventures fuelled by the availability of funds even for very early-stage companies. But now, the base of the   funding pyramid is shrinking, which could adversely impact the pace of creation of new ventures.

 The number of angel and seed investments made in the first half of 2017 (January to June) is down to 260 -a sharp drop from 419 in the first half of 2016, according to data from startup analytics firm Tracxn. Seed funding has seen a particularly steep decline, from 278 to 152.
 
 Kunal Upadhayay , CEO of  , an early-stage venture capital arm of IIM-Ahmedabad's Centre for Innovation,   (CIIE), said early-stage funding has dried a bit. “Investments in con sumer-focused sectors like marketplaces, and services have come down significantly. Since there are no takers for those ideas, and the funding is drying up, entrepreneurs are not excited any more,“ he said.
 
 The focus is on fewer ventures, those that investors think have a better chance of survival. These are also receiving higher levels of funding.This is visible across several metrics.
 
 The deal sizes in angel and seed rounds have increased, even though deal numbers are down. The total angel and seed funding has risen to $155 million in the first half of 2017, from $123 million in the year-ago period.
 
 The total funding in 2017 at $5.1 billion is more than double that in 2016, at $2 billion, but that's because of the two big funding rounds of $1.4 billion each in   and  .
 
 K Ganesh, who has invested in a number of startups through his venture Growth Story , says the focus is now on sustainable business models. “The valuations and ticket sizes are reverting to the 2014 levels, which is good for everybody . Else we had hysteria on all fronts. We had a retired couple next door wanting to do angel funding, an opportunistic entrepreneur coming in thinking he will raise $2 million on the basis of a paper plan. All that has stopped,“ Ganesh says.
