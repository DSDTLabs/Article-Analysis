NEW DELHI: Low-cost airline AirAsia India on Sunday said that starting Monday it would fly passengers in seven   at a promotional base fare starting from Rs 99, excluding taxes.

 "The promotional fares start from Rs 99 under the dynamic pricing to cities like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi, Kolkata, New Delhi, Pune and Ranchi," it said in a statement here.
 
 "Passengers can book from Monday up to January 21 and avail the offer to travel from January 15 to July 31," it added.
 
 However, adding a rider to the scheme, the airline said that the discount applies to bookings made through the carrier's official website- airasia.com and AirAsia mobile app.
 
 The budget carrier's parent firm AirAsia will also fly its passengers at Rs 1,499 base fare from Indian cities to 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific region (APAC), including Auckland, Bali, Bangkok, Kuala Lampur, Melbourne, Singapore and Sydney.
 
 Last week the airline's group chief executive Tony Fernandes had said that Malaysia-based AirAsia Bhd is considering an initial public offering for its Indian unit and seeking a partner for its services business. This is the latest in a series of asset monetisations being undertaken by the budget airline group, which this week received shareholder nod for a reorganisation to make AirAsia Group Bhd the listed holding company for assets across Asia.
 
 
 
 
 The low-cost fare offer is on all flights of the group network, including AirAsia India, AirAsia Berhad, Thai AirAsia, AirAsia X and Indonesia AirAsia X. In the $30 million joint venture, Tata Sons Ltd has 51 per cent equity stake and   Investment Ltd of Malaysia holds the balance 49 per cent.
 
 The over three-year airline flies to 16 Indian cities including Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Guwahati, Panaji, Imphal, Jaipur, Kochi and Visakhapatnam.
 
 Indian skies have been locked in a pitched fare battle for the last couple of years as airlines try to woo customers with discounted fares on a regular basis. Analysts believe the stiff competition among airlines amid robust growth in the number of passengers is leading to lower fares.
