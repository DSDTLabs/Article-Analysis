A few weeks have passed since   allegedly misbehaved with his co-star   on a Melbourne-Mumbai flight. While most people felt that Kapil’s public apology would be enough to get their relationship back on track, those close to Sunil firmly believe that it was not heartfelt. They say that the apology looked like a calculated move by Kapil to save his public image and gain some sympathy from his fans.
Informs a source close to Sunil, “The apology came two days after the incident, which seemed more like a result of public pressure. Kapil had even unfollowed Sunil on Twitter the next day after returning from Australia. If he had any repentance, he would have personally apologised to Sunil and the rest of the team. Kapil used terms like, ‘If I have hurt you unintentionally...’ Of course, he has hurt Sunil and he can’t get away saying that he was under the influence of alcohol. It’s not easy for Sunil to forget the incident. He has now made up his mind and is in no mood to return to 
 Kapil’s show.”
 Meanwhile, the latest development is that the channel that airs ' ' is in talks with Sunil for a separate show. The source adds, “Talks are on and several meetings have taken place, but Sunil is biding his time. He is getting offers from other channels too. He would be happy to take   along as well. Chandan was also treated badly by Kapil on the same flight, which is why he too left the show.”
