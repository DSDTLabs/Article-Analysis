After the CISF deployment, agitations have been totally eliminated and a conducive atmosphere is prevailing in the court, it said. As for the city civil and small causes courts campuses, CCTV cameras are in operation and whenever misconduct of advocates is brought to the knowledge of the registrar, it is forwarded to the Bar council for appropriate action, the report said.
