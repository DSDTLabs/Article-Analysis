Digaria (Churu): Dr N K Malpani of the Malpani Hospital refused to comment on whether 19 labourers were admitted to the hospital or that they even came there from April 18 to 20. Facing controversy over conducting clinical trials on 15 of the 19 labourers from a Churu village, Malpani termed the entire episode as ‘fake.’ 

 The hospital owner questioned this correspondent if anyone had seen these labourers. “Has anyone talked to them?” said Malpani. The correspondent told the doctor about having met 11 of these men at their village in Digaria and that all of them had narrated how they were brought and kept in the hospital basement from 1 pm on April 18 pm till 12noon on April 20. 
 
 When TOI repeatedly asked him if the 19 labourers visited his hospital, Malpani dodged the question by saying, “It is not appropriate for me to respond to this question. I have said everything, which is needed, to the committee.”
 
 Malpani, however, asked if anybody was ill among those labourers. When he was informed about two of them being very ill, the doctor was quick to ask what was the proof that they were ill due to a tablet given to them by his hospital.
 
 Contrary to the claims made by Malpani, assistant sub-inspector of Jaipur’s Vishwakarma police station Rajendra Prasad said that all of them mentioned the name of the hospital in their statements. Prasad recorded statements of 10 of the 15 victims in Digaria. “In the statement, the victims have categorically talked about Malpani hospital and the duration of their stay there,” Prasad told TOI.
 
 The victims in their testimony to the police have revealed that the hospital offered them liquor, food and beds in the hospital basement. The victims reported to the police that for 21 hours from 1pm on April 19 till 10am on April 20, they were under the influence of medicines and lay in the hospital beds without food and water. They were woken up by the hospital authorities only for the next round of medicines.
