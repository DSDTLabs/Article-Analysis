NAGPUR: The consumer   of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd ( ) has come down heavily on a consumer Prabhakar Dhage, a farmer from Wardha district, for filing a bogus complaint against the discom. 

 Forum chairman   has warned that if such bogus complaints were filed in future, heavy fine would be imposed on the petitioners. The forum penalized MSEDCL for delaying the issuance of the demand note to the consumer.
 
 Dhage, a resident of   village (Hinganghat taluka in Wardha district), had claimed compensation from MSEDCL on account of delay in releasing the connection even though he had not submitted the test report.
 
 Dhage had applied for a power connection for his agricultural pump on March 3, 2015. As per norms of   ( ), MSEDCL should have issued the demand note within 30 days, that is by April 3, 2015, but it was issued on May 16, 2015. The forum awarded the complainant a compensation for the delay of 41 days.
 
 As per MSEDCL procedure, the applicant has to submit a test report after the demand note is issued. The petitioner had not submitted the report even till the date of the order. 
 
 The forum took objection over this fact and termed the complaint as bogus. Patil in his order stated “Applicant and like-minded people, who are in the habit of filing bogus, false and premature cases, should take notice and not file premature cases in future, otherwise compensation may be recovered from them for harassing MSEDCL officers and the company”.
 
 Welcoming the order, a MSEDCL officer claimed that such cases were filed at the behest of some agents, who were habitual offenders. “This order is a lesson for such people. We appeal to consumers to file complaints themselves and not come under the influence of such agents,” he said.
