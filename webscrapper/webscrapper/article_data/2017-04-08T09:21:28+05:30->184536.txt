AMARAVATI: Ayesha Meera's parents met chief minister   here on Friday and demanded a fresh probe into their daughter's murder. They appealed to the CM to ensure that the real culprits are sent behind bars. 

 Responding to the pleas of Shamshad Begum and Iqbal Pasha, Naidu assured them that justice will be done. Begum, who spoke to reporters after meeting Naidu in Velagapudi, said: "We are very delighted and satisfied with the chief minister's response. He told us that we fought well and that he will get justice for our family."
 
 "The CM also said he will meet the top police officials in the coming days and discuss the case with them. I am confident and hopeful that he will pay heed to our demand to reopen the case and get justice for my daughter," she said.
 
 The demand for a fresh probe is growing from activists after Satyam Babu was pronounced innocent in the murder case. Ayesha, a B Pharmacy student, was found murdered in her hostel on December 26, 2007. Naidu, who was the opposition leader then, had supported Ayesha's family and fought hard in the Assembly against then chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy.
 
 The Vijayawada police are exploring legal options to appeal against the high court verdict in the  , citing that there was nothing wrong with their probe. Police commissioner   will meet DGP Sambasiva Rao once he arrives from his Israel trip to take this forward.
