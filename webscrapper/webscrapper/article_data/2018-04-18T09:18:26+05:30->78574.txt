ALWAR: Timely action by the police stopped an attempt to solemnise a child marriage by a driver, Kailash, in   of   district on Wednesday. The man was about to marry off his minor son Mukesh (name changed) when the police intervened and stopped the ceremony.

 When police entered the house Kaliash, his relatives and guests were preparing for the wedding procession (baraat) to be taken out. Kailash’s son Mukesh was getting married with a girl from Haryana. Police reached the house as they got the information that Mukesh was just 12-years-old and stopped the wedding.
 
 The family members tried to fool the police saying that it was not Mukesh but his uncle who was tying the knot. Police took along Mukesh’s uncle and presented him before the child welfare committee (CWC), where the man accepted that he wasn’t the one getting married. The CWC directed the police to bring Mukesh along with them and admitted him to a child care home to prevent his wedding.
 
 CWC chairperson Shravan   said that they had received information that a family was marrying off a minor boy. Therefore, they informed   police station.
 
 Singhal said, the date of the wedding is April 18 and invitation cards were also printed.
 
 He said that the boy would stay at the child care home until after the wedding date. Also, CWC has issued direction to the police to warn Mukesh’s parents not to try and get him married before he attains the legal age.
 
 CWC came to know that Kailash has five children. Mukesh has two elder brothers, one 16-year-old and another 14-year-old. Both of them are not married. Mukesh is a class V student.
 
 Mukesh told CWC that his mother had protested against the wedding. He was getting married to a girl, who has one more sister. He said that their father was marrying off his two daughters on the same day. He told CWC that he had not seen the girl with whom he was getting married.
 
 Further investigation into the case is on.
