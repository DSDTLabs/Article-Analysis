NEW DELHI: Ireland are currently in the midst of a historic Test against Pakistan and after a frustrating rain-delay which washed out the opening day's play, they have finally got a taste of what playing cricket's longest format at international level is like. 

 
 Pakistan batted first and their former captain and legendary bowler   spotted an oddity with the uniform of their batsmen â€“ a missing green stripe from the sweater.
 
 The cricketer-turned-commentator wasn't impressed with the change.
 
 He immediately took a snapshot of a Pakistan batsman and posted it on his Twitter handle asking a simple question: "Where is the green stripe gone from our sweater? Not cool."
 
  
  
 
 Traditionally the Test sweaters worn by Pakistan cricketers have a green stripe running along the neckline. However, against Ireland in the ongoing one-off Test in Malahide, the stripe has gone missing prompting the question from Akram who represented Pakistan in 104 Tests, took 414 wickets and scored 2898 runs in a storied career.
 
 The   (PCB) took notice of Akram's tweet, thanked him and a promised to launch a serious inquiry.
 
  
  
 
 Explaining his reaction, Akram later tweeted that the decision to do away with the stripe to give the uniform a modern look is something that should have been conveyed, especially to those who have "played proudly with his kit".
 
  
  
 
 Do you think the green stripe should return to keep the tradition alive?
