PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A social activist is up in arms about alleged unauthorized tree cutting on land belonging to the state animal husbandry department.

 
  
 Datta Saikar said he will write to chief minister   and environment ministe  , seeking action against the officials responsible for felling more than 50 trees on the land in   and   in  . 
 
 The department owns hundreds of acres from Pavana river in Thergaon to Sangvi-Kiwale BRTS road and beyond. There is a thick growth of trees along the river. The animal husbandry department breeds cows on this tract of land to improve milk productivity. 
 
 According to the activist, this vast area with a large number of trees serves as a green lung for the city, in view of the ever-increasing vehicular traffic and population due to rapid urbanization in the surrounding areas of Thergaon, Tathawade, Walhekarwadi, Punawale and Ravet. 
 
 “The state government is making every effort to increase tree cover in the state through massive tree plantation drives. So it is unfortunate that a state department is cutting trees so recklessly. So I will be writing letters to the chief minister and  , demanding that action be taken against the officials responsible,” Saikar said. 
 
 The activist said a friend, also a social activist, had brought this to his attention a few days ago. 
 
 “I have confirmed the that more than 50 trees were cut. I have taken photographs and even enquired with the officials. However, their responses were evasive. I have no choice but to complaint to the CM and the environment minister,” he added.
 
 S C Vidhate, the manager of the animal farm in question, was unavailable for comment. The official did not respond to phone calls or SMSes seeking the reason for cutting the trees, whether or not rules were followed while cutting trees, if any other option — such as tree transplantation — was explored and how many trees are to be planted to compensate for the lost trees.
