 However, no formal police complaint was registered till late on Saturday.
 
 In a complaint, city-based developer Shailesh Bhatt had alleged that police inspector A P Patel from Amreli and one officer from   extorted money from him on two different occasions. Bhatt alleged that his partner Kirit Paladiya is also involved in the extortion racket with the cops. 
 
 After receiving the complaint against Bhatt, CID started an inquiry and registered several statements of those linked to the case. CID is also investigating background of Bhatt, who claims to have bought 200 bitcoins (crypto currency) in a short span. Bhatt is accused in a forgery case where it is alleged that he made fake land documents. The case was registered in Karjan police station in Vadodara a couple of days ago. 
 
 “CID is collecting evidences and as of now it looks like there is some basis for Bhatt’s allegations. We found many useful details, but at this moment we cannot register a complaint. Only after the inquiry is complete we may decide the future course of action,” DGP CID (crime) Ashish Bhatia said.
 
 “Amreli police is cooperating with the inquiry and further action will be taken based upon the inquiry findings,” superintendent of police, Amreli, Jagdish Patel said.
 
 “CID is only investigating the role of cops from   police and not the allegations made against CBI officer. If the offence is made, we will go for registration of a complaint and a departmental inquiry will also be conducted,” Bhatia added.
