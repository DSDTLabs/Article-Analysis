ALLAHABAD:   have turned to the  , situated in Lucknow, to draw   to crack down on blind murder or  . 

 Only the technical wing is equipped with the NCRB (National Crime Record Bureau) software to draw portraits of criminals. The NCRB software has a bank of facial components that artists can pick and choose from to arrive at a relatively accurate sketch.
 
 Police of all districts are outsourcing private sketch-makers or taking the help of the technical wing to draw sketches. SP (Computer) Santosh Mishra said, "All 75 districts are taking the help of the technical wing to draw portraits. The technical wing is committed to impart training to constables as well. 
 
 He, however, said that the help of the technical wing is sought only when a case is placed under the blind category. Majority of district police currently outsource the work to private artists. In the past one year, police have had more than 24 portraits done, mostly of chain- and purse-snatchers. 
 
 Allahabad SSP Shalabh Mathur said, "We outsource sketch-making to private individuals who prepare criminals' portraits based on the description provided by victims and eyewitnesses."
 
 However, cops feel there should be an advanced computer-aided facility or lab at each and every district that would help draw sketches in no time.
