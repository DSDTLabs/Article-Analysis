PANAJI: School students and their grandparents were recently given a chance to forge better bonds through simple gestures such as participating in art and craft activities together. The initiative was part of a gender-sensitive intervention for change organised by students of the MA course in women’s studies at the  . 

 Called ‘Bridge the Gap’, the approach was aimed at creating concern and reverence, and inculcating feelings of affection, thereby strengthening the bond of attachment with the elderly. “The aim of the programme is to get children to use their creativity to reach out to their grandparents and make them happy,”  , a final-year postgraduate student of the women’s studies course, who organised it, said. 
 
 The grandparents of students from Santo Minguel High School, Taleigao, accompanied their grandchildren to school where the latter engaged in a number of activities: Writing down the good qualities of their grandparents and sharing them publicly, participating in a short play together with them, understanding the need for them to look presentable, boys learning to sew buttons on their grandfathers’ shirts, applying nail polish onto their grandmothers’ nails, as well as other art and craft sessions that helped the two generations connect. 
 
 All students of the MA course carry out gender-sensitive interventions for change with an objective to bring about some kind of change in society. Students get out of the classroom, create campaigns, use various media and target various groups to affect change.
