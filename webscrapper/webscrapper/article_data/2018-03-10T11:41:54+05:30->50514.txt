BHOPAL: Here is a bad news for some 60,000 houses. The wait for   for houses in new and   areas gets only longer. A private contractor, engaged by the   (BMC) for the all-important project, backed out of contract, citing a delay in payment. With April — one of the peak summer months just 20 days away — the contractor’s action raised anxiety levels of residents waiting for the water supply.

 More than 30% drinking water supply need was expected to be met by   —long pitched as the solution to deal with water crisis in the state capital, ahead of the summer season. Water in both Upper Lake and the   is nearing minimum levels. With three peak summer months ahead, BMC officials are tight-lipped about the issue. “Tenders for new contractor would be finalised in a couple of days. We are working on the situation,” said BMC city engineer AK Pawar.
 
 An estimated 1.5 lakh connections through Narmada pipeline were scheduled to be completed by March. An estimated 60,000 connections with water metres are yet to be completed.
 
 
 Source said deviation from original plan hindered implementation of the project. Delay in Narmada water connections is expected to have an impact in Professors Colony, TT Nagar and other parts of the walled city.
 
 For each household with Narmada water connection, the BMC also installed water metre. Going by domestic water rate of Rs14 (per 1000 litre) notified by the state government in 2006, an average consumer may have toshellout minimum ofRs 420 per month. Currently, the civic body charges a flat rate of Rs180 per month.
 
 For the civic body, the primary focus is billing consumers through water metres or pay per use. On paper, there are about1.19lakhconsumers, who have water metres. However, bills are being generated for just about15,000 consumers.
 
 According to estimates by the BMC, 16 of the 85 municipal wards are facing acute shortage of water. Residents in wards 5, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 25, 27, 31, 34 to 38 and 81 to 85 barely get water for more than an hour per day. TNN
