Indore: On the basis of traffic pressure and requirement of residents, Atal Indore City Transport Services Ltd (AICTSL) has finalized five routes where it will operate electric buses. 

 “Our tentative plan for operations of electric buses will include routes from Railway Station to Kalani Nagar, Malwa Mill to Chandan Nagar, Gangwal Bus Stand to Khajrana, Teen Imli to Chanakyapuri Square, and Hawa Bangla to Baneshwari Kund,” said AICTSL chief executive officer Sandeep Soni. 
 
 The average distance of these routes is around 7-8 km and their travel time would range around 20-25 minutes. 
 
 Soni said that 40 electric buses will be introduced on these five routes. “Each of these routes will have eight electric buses,” he said, adding that they have finalized the agency for procurement of these buses, and hope to introduce the service in coming two-three months. 
 
 Officials said that these electric buses will be introduce by Indore Municipal Corporation to provide better connectivity within the city and to stations nearby. Central government will provide incentives for the same. 
 
 These battery operated buses are expected to be of mid-size. They will have low floors to accommodate maximum commuters at a time. “As maximum travel time in the city is around 25-30 minutes which does not require Volvo size buses, so we have planned to introduce bus with some modification to provide both seating and standing arrangements for commuters,” they said. 
 
 At present, the AICTSL operates around 170 buses in city. It includes 40 i-buses on the BRTS corridor, 65 mid-size buses and 72 city buses with a total daily passenger count of over1.4 lakh.
