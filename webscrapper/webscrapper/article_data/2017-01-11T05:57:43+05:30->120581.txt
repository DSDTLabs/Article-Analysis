HYDERABAD: Chief Minister   on Tuesday directed power grid officials to make necessary changes to the ongoing power transmission lines so that they could be linked with the national grid. 

 The new grid comprises two lines connecting East and West and East and North India. In the meeting between the CM, Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL) chairman IS Jha and   chairman D Prabhakar Rao at Pragathi Bhavan here on Tuesday, Jha told KCR that works related to the Wardha — Dichpalli 765 kv double circuit transmission line will be completed by March this year. Once completed, this line could give access to 4,500 mw power to   and become a game changer.
 
 While congratulating the power grid officials for speedy completion of the works, the chief minister suggested that the Wardha — Dichpalli line should be in a position to handle additional power from the two national grids. 
 
 The power grid officials said once the 765 kv line is completed, transmission of power from Chhattisgarh would become a reality. The Telangana government has entered into agreements with power developers in Chhattisgarh to supply power to Telangana and all these power producers are waiting for the completion of the Wardha line.“Once our line is connected to the national grid, then Telangana will be in a position to generate power from anywhere in the country,” pointed the chief minister. PGCIL also agreed to invest in augmentation of transmission facilities in Telangana in the coming days. 
 
 Several new transmission and distribution lines have been proposed for upgradation in the state. The Telangana energy department and PGCIL will present a road map for the future cooperation in the transmission sector.
