KOLKATA: A day after the Narcotics Control Bureau ( ) arrested a man from Maharastra for allegedly selling party drugs in the city, three persons, including a Mumbai resident, were arrested on Saturday for allegedly trying to sell MDMA at  . 

 A total of 11.6g MDMA, which goes for Rs 5,500-Rs 6,000 per gm, was seized from the accused. The drug - commonly known as ecstasy - was reportedly meant for rave parties being arranged on the edge of New Town and in an undisclosed location near Sonarpur-Baruipur.
 
 Main accused Gunjan Kumar Singh, 25, was nabbed from in front of a high-end restaurant on Park Street after sleuths followed him from Howrah Station. "We received information from our source in Mumbai and it took us some time to track him down. At Park Street, we also nabbed Urvil Jaiswal alias Shyam and Subhasish Naskar, both residents of Narendrapur. While Jaiswal dropped out of school after Class XII, he studied designing at a south Kolkata college, later moving to Bengaluru to work at a call centre. We are now probing his Mumbai connection as some more people are under our radar," said an officer.
 
 Sources said the narcotic laws specify three forms of punishment under the NDPS Act, based on the amount of drugs seized - the lowest punishment is reserved for those at the consumer level and the commercial level gets the highest penalty. "Since 10gm attracts the maximum punishment, dealers usually don't carry so much on themselves. The fact that these men brought around 11.6gm with them show they were well entrenched in the city and must have a broad client base here," an officer said. 
 
  said   has seized 16.3gm MDMA and the NCB has seized 13.5gm, as well as nine ecstasy pills this year alone. "We need to curtail these party drugs and not just cocaine, heroin and ganja, if we want to stop youths from getting attracted to rave parties," said an officer.
