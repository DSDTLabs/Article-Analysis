SURAT: The fate of over 6,000 students of Experimental School hangs in balance as the   has decided to renew its land lease only on the basis of prescribed rates to be decided by land disposal committee. There is every chance of the land disposal committee of the civic body taking prevailing markets into consideration to arrive at the rate for land lease. Should this happen, then the Experimental School run by   would be forced to shift to some other premises. The society has been asked to give its suggestions within a week’s time to the civic body. 

 SMC had given 12,578 sq metre of land in   on lease to Sarvajanik Education Society until 1999-2000 for Re 1 for a year. The lease expired 18 years ago and needs to be renewed. 
 
 The SMC standing committee said if the lease is renewed, then it should be on prevailing market rates only. The market rate and the present jantri rate will be much higher than the lease amount of Re 1 per year now. The present jantri rate for land in Parle Point is around Rs 50, 000 per sq feet. The market rate could be between Rs 80,000 per sq feet and Rs 1,20,000 per sq feet. 
 
 “SMC would be taking a decision at what rate should dues of recovery from the school be collected and from when. The income tax department was given land at the market rate of Rs 40 crore,” a standing committee member said. 
 
 Another member of the standing committee said, “We would take care of future of 6,000 students. We have number of options before us. The school can be taken over by some other trust which is willing to pay up the rates decided by the land disposal committee.”
