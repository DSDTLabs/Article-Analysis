NEW DELHI: Minister of state for home Kiren   on Monday said the opposition raked up issues like mob lynching only to tarnish the image of PM  , which ultimately went against the nation.

 “The opposition does not seem serious about a debate on the issue and their sole intention is to politicise the matter and attack the prime minister,” Rijiju said as   staged a walkout as soon as the minister started replying to the six-hour debate sought by Congress MP   and Trinamool’s   on incidents of lynching and mob violence.
 
 Rijiju said the PM had spoken strongly against those indulging in violence in the name of cow protection but leaders of opposition parties had never shown the same promptness when such incidents happened under their regimes.
 
 “Opposition wants that the PM should handle the law and order of every state but we have a federal structure and it is not possible,” Rijiju said as Congress netas walked out. 
 
 Congress was unhappy about Rijiju giving a detailed statewide count of cow-related violence before the   government came to power in 2014. “It is not a new trend but the opposition is now making it a national issue,” he said. 
 
 Rijiju said when some JNU students hurled abuses at ‘Bharat Mata’, opposition leaders were not as prompt as they were about violence related to cow protection.
