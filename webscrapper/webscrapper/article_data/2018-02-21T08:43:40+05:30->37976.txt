KOZHIKODE: The high court’s order setting aside the appointment of   as vicechancellor of Mahatma Gandhi   on the ground that he did not satisfy the qualifications stipulated by the   could lead to legal challenges to the appointment of   vice-chancellor   as well.

 Association of Calicut University Teachers (ACT) had soon after Basheer’s appointment in November 2015 written to the chancellor stating that the VC, who has around 8 years’ experience as principal of Sullamussalam Science College and two years’ stint as   registrar, did not meet the UGC eligibility criteria of minimum 10 years of experience as ‘professor’ in a University system.
 
 
 Also in the light of the HC verdict, the validity of the VC search committee which recommended Basheer’s name could be challenged. Current IUML MLA Abid Hussain Thangal was the syndicate representative in the committee.
 
 UGC regulations say that the committee member should be a person of eminence in the sphere of higher education and should not be connected with the university or affiliated colleges.
 
 “The grounds upheld by the high court to disqualify Babu Sebastian is equally applicable to Mohammed Basheer,” said  , the chairman of the varsity’s board of studies of management studies.
 
 Another senior professor said the experience as principal of an affiliated college can’t be considered. “The contention that the salary of university professor and principal are same doesn’t hold water as the eligibility criteria for appointment as varsity professor and college principal are not the same,” he added.
 
 The Association of Calicut University Teachers (ACT) welcomed the HC order with regard to MGU vice-chancellor and demanded that the state government should ensure it is followed by other varsities as well.
