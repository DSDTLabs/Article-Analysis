MUMBAI: Second-year civil engineering students who flunked semester III exams about five months ago were stumped to see almost the same question paper in the repeater   on May 22. The   set almost an identical 'Strength of Materials' paper for the same set of students who gave their regular exams on December 7 and are now appearing for   exam. The university will seek an explanation from the teachers responsible for setting the paper. 

 Only two questions carrying 8 and 4 marks each were changed, the remaining questions carrying 68 marks-85% of the total 80 marks-were completely ripped off from the previous paper. "How can you test the students on the same question paper twice? The paper setters seem to be casual about their work," said a second-year student.
 
 "The officials need to take stringent action against such teachers. It is also the university's fault as it appoints the same teachers on the paper-setting committee year after year," said Vaibhav Narawade from the Mumbai University and College Teachers' Association. Some of the teachers claimed that it has happened more than once in the civil engineering branch.
 
 Vinod Malale, official spokesperson for university's examination section, said that they will seek an explanation from the paper setter. "We will decide on the next course of action, once after the explanation is given," he said. Whether the paper setter was the same for both the exams is still not known, added Malale.
 
 This is not the first time that MU's papers are repeated. Many of the reported cases, in fact, are from the engineering faculty, said a university official, adding that many times it is also the case of teachers taking private tuitions.
