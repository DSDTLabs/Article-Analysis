LUCKNOW:   chief   should also be booked under POCSO along with the expelled BSP leader   as the latter had told the media that the demonstration against her husband,  , was organized at her behest. “She provoked the crowd to shout obscene slogans against me and my minor daughter,” said the minister of state with independent charge   while talking to TOI on Friday.

 Swati was reacting to the reported submission of Siddiqui before the police that he had led the dharna and shouted slogans on the instructions of Mayawati. After Daya Shankar’s uncharitable remarks against Mayawati, BSP workers -- led by Siddiqui -- staged a dharna in Lucknow in which they allegedly shouted obscene slogans against Swati and her daughter.
 
 Swati thereafter led huge protest against Mayawati and Siddiqui, claiming that Mayawati was responsible for the trauma she and her minor daughter were facing and she should be booked for an offence.
 
  “Today, when Siddiqui informed the police which is investigating the case against him that he was directed by Mayawati to stage the demonstration, my charges against Mayawati stand vindicated and she should be booked under POCSO and as a conspirator,” Swati reiterated.
