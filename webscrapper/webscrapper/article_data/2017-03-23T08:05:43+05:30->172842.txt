CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Wednesday declined to pass any order on a PIL against the candidature of   general secretary   in the April 12 byelection to R K Nagar constituency. The bench asked the petitioner to approach the authorities concerned for remedy.

 The first bench of acting Chief Justice Huluvadi G Ramesh and Justice R M T Teekaraman disposed of the PIL of P A Joseph of Arumbakkam without any specific directive to any authorities.
 
 Joseph's contention was that Dinakaran had been imposed a penalty of Rs 28 crore for FERA violations, and the punishment was upheld by the first bench of Madras high court as well. He also served a whole term after being detained under Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (COFEPOSA), and his detention was upheld by the  . In this regard, Joseph said adjudication pro ceedings under special laws such as   Act, 1962, and FERA, 1973, are painal procee rallel to criminal proceedings, and added that restricting disqualification from contesting in polls to only conviction in criminal proceedings, and not for payment of penalty under special acts after adjudication proceedings was unfair.
 
 “The parliament has no power to restrict the disqualification only to criminal conviction when the very act holds that both adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings are parallel and the very act never differentiate both proceedings,“ said Joseph. He sought to declare Sections 8(1)(c) and 8(1) (e) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951as illegal and unconstitutional since it restricted disqualification only to criminal conviction and not for punishment for adjudication proceedings under special acts such as Customs Act, 1962 and FERA, 1973.
