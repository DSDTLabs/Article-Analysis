PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Shravan Hardikar, the Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner, promised to look into   of   against opposition corporators and the double standards in taking action against agitators from the ruling   and the opposition parties.

 Two months ago, when MNS corporator Sachin Chikhale had dumped garbage on the PCMC’s main office premises in Pimpri — to protest the non-clearance of garbage from his ward — a civic official had lodged a cognizable offence against him. The act had caused a huge uproar then. The members of the opposition parties had pointed out that many corporators had agitated inside the   building — either by dumping garbage or raising slogans against the civic administration and the ruling party — during the 15-year rule of the NCP, but no cognizable offence had ever been lodged before.
 
 In contrast, when BJP corporator Tushar Kamathe dumped 400 unauthorised posters in the PCMC building, a PCMC security guard booked only a non-cognizable offence against him. 
 
 Senior police inspector V V Mugalikar confirmed that a non-cognisable offence had been lodged against Kamathe. This double standard — a more serious cognizable offence case against an opposition corporator and non-cognizable offence case against a BJP corporator — has not gone down well with the opposition parties.
 
 Talking to TOI, Hardikar said, “I had directed the civic officials to lodge a police complaint in this incident like we had done in the earlier case. I will check what actually happened in the case.”
 
 Chikhale said, “The civic administration is favouring the BJP and discriminating against the opposition.”
