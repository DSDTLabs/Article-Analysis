BENGALURU: Teachers from 210 schools in the city had a rejuvenating time at the annual   held at The Times of India's state-of-the-art printing facility in   on Friday. 

 The teachers enjoyed a mind-and-body relaxation session, during which they experienced a unique technique that uses vibrations to relieve stress. SRIKAM sound and healing managing director   explained how an ancient Tibetan practice uses singing bowls and gongs to help the body vibrate at a healing frequency. This therapy helps in relieving stress and staying focussed, and is particularly beneficial for students. He conducted the bowl-and-gong relaxation session for all teachers.
 
 The teachers were given a tour of the printing facility after The Times of India vice-president (production) Alan Carvalho gave a presentation on the printing process. Teachers felt the visit to the press was an eye-opener that gave them an experience they could share with their students. The concept of deadlines and the effort that goes into bringing out the paper became clear to them.
 
 Teachers Lakshmi Aravind from St Mary's Convent, T Dasarahalli; Elsa Jose from   ASC Centre and College; Vanishree A L from Air Force School, Hebbal and   from BEL CBSE Vidyalaya were awarded for their long association with Times NIE. The prizes were sponsored by Silver Bijoux.
 
 S Sekar, DGM and plant head, TOI, conducted a mock fire-and-safety drill session for the teachers.
