VADODARA: Family members of a  , who died during treatment after arrest, were booked for rioting outside   station on Sunday.

 Ranchhod Pateliya (70) was arrested on February 28 with three other persons in connection with assault case. On March 1, he was hospitalized and his family members alleged that his health deteriorated as the cops did not allow him to have home-made food. Pateliya died during treatment at hospital in Mahisagar on Saturday morning.
 
 His family members refused to accept the body and demanded that an FIR be registered against the police as he was not allowed to have home food. 
 
 The family members even went to the district collector and superintendent of police to make representations. 
 
 Senior officials inquired about the incidents and even insisted on checking the CCTV footages of the police station.
 
 “Since he was an elderly person, we did not put him up in lock-up and made him sit in the computer room of the police station. It is clearly visible in the footages that they Pateliya was served the food that all other accused had,” said a police official.
 
 Cops said when the senior officials turned down the family’s request after checking the footages, they went to Santrampur police station and manhandled police station officer who had not allowed Pateliya to have home food.“Pateliya was already ill and on medicines when we had arrested him therefore the family’s allegation that he died since he did not have home-made food is wrong,” said the police official. 
 
 His body was brought to   on Saturday. The police said that the exact reason behind Pateliya’s death will be known after the report comes.
 
 The police said that they will arrest all those who have been booked on Monday since the family members were busy with Pateliya’s final rites on Sunday.
