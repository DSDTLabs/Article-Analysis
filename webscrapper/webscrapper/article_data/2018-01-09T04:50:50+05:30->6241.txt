MUMBAI: Hours after TOI called up civic officials on Monday to inquire about a   running without a food licence or occupation certificate (OC), the   sealed the establishment. Civic officials said that action had been initiated against 10th Street Cafe in the past and material had been seized but it continued operations. 

 The cafe opened on the ground floor of Sukmani Building in JVPD last October. The ground floor does not have an OC. The fire brigade had issued a conditional NOC but despite not fulfilling the riders, the cafe continued operations. On Monday, when TOI called up assistant civic commissioner Prashant Gaikwad to ask why the cafe, despite complaints from residents, was still running, he said action had been taken. When told that the cafe was still operational, he directed his officers to initiate action. By evening, the fire brigade sealed the premises. Gaikwad said a prosecution case has been registered against the owner. 
 
 Hitesh Nihalani, son of Asoo Nihalani of Moolight Builders Pvt Ltd, said the building was being redeveloped and the OC had been delayed. He said the shop had been given on a leave-and-license basis while water and electricity were provided from connections for the building construction. 
 
 Ashoke Pandit, chairman,  , said, " If TOI had not raised the issue, the illegality would have continued." Resident Usha Khosa said only four shops are allowed on the ground floor but there are eight. "There are partition walls for each shop. The building staircase begins on the footpath," she said. 
 
 Gaikwad said notice has been issued to the builder to remove the partitions. "The builder has been given one month. We can demolish only after that," he added.
