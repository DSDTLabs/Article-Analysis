VADODARA: Ruckus broke out at Godhra-based Shri   (SGGU) on Sunday afternoon after some candidates appearing for the junior clerks exam alleged that the   Dr Gitesh Joshi was helping one of the candidates in block 5 of the exam centre. The exam was being conducted by the state government.

 After the exam ended, around 10 students raised slogans against the registrar at the  , where the exam was held, after which SGGU’s vice-chancellor Dr M K Padalia rushed to talk to the protesters.The students told Padalia that Joshi was helping one of the candidates and sought CCTV footages of the block. Padalia, however, refused to show them the footages and assured that he would approach the government on the allegations. “After meeting the students, I called the registrar and asked him about the allegations. He told me that he had gone there during the final minutes of the exam on a routine round and the candidate in question talked to him because he had some doubt about a question,” said Padalia. 
 
 He added that he would personally inspect the footages on Monday.
