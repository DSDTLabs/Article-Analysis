NEW DELHI: National Green Tribunal on Monday formed a joint-inspection committee of officials from Delhi,   to monitor the levels of   and, once again, asked authorities to check how much water was flowing into the river.

 A bench comprising of judicial member Justice Jawad Rahim asked DJB and Yamuna Upper Canal Board to check the flow of water into the Yamuna and the amount of water that was being extracted at Okhla. The bench directed them to inform   on the same by the next date of the hearing.
 
 The directions came after the Delhi counsel had argued that water being released by Haryana government had reduced considerably, leading to dried up areas in the Yamuna.
 
 NGT had earlier rapped DJB, asking them what they had done to clean Yamuna and that Haryana could not be blamed solely. The bench notedthat the river had been reduced to a ‘sewer line’ in the capital.
 
 “Why are you picking up things here and there?” the bench had said earlier. “We are only concerned with pollution in Yamuna. You are coming up with a new plea each time. We are interested in the entire stretch of Yamuna and not confined to segments. We are not going to compartmentalise the river as it is all one ecosystem,” the bench observed.
