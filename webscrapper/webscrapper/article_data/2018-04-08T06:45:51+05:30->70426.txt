 “Both varieties have been replaced by smaller watermelons. Farmers were finding it impractical to grow the long variety as the productivity is quite less, only around 10-11 tonne per acre. Meanwhile, the ‘sugar baby’ variety comes from surrounding regions such as Solapur, Satara, Sangli and  . It sells at Rs10-12, per kg, so its price is high but quality is low due to the brix content,” said Ghule.

For farmers, the two varieties have a huge variation in terms of productivity. While, naamdhari’s productivity is 10-12 tonne, per acre, sugar king’s productivity is 25-35 tonne, per acre. Hence the switch to ‘sugar king’.”
