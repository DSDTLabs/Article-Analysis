NEW DELHI: Restricted field trials of certain transgenic varieties of rice, wheat, maize and chickpea and discussions to determine the next course of action on  's commercial release will be on the agenda of the   meeting on April 12. 

  "We will examine the pending applications of various research institutions and companies on different varieties of GM crops. Once they are allowed for confined field trials, they will have to take no-objection certificates from states," said an official. 
 
  On commercial release of GM mustard, he said the government would go by the  's decision on the pending petition. "Though a sub-committee of the   hasy given its safety clearance for GM mustard, we need to submit our report to the environment minister ( ) for final call." 
 
  The biotech regulator last year made the report of the sub-committee public and sought comments from stakeholders. "Its outcome will also be placed before the ministry which may submit it to the court," said the official. 
 
  The regulator had last year decided to relax the requirement of NOC from states for "Event Selection Trials" (ESTs), which are small scale experiments conducted within the premises of institutes. "It had decided that a decision regarding NOC is to be communicated to applicant within 90 days from the date of receipt and if, in the mean time, the state does not take any appropriate action, the decision is to be considered positive by the applicant," he said. The GEAC had not given any relaxation in requirement of obtaining NOC from states for "Confined Field Trial" (CFT). 
 
  The central regulator had recommended field trials for as many as 13 transgenic varieties of rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, cotton, brinjal, mustard, potato, sugarcane and chickpea in 2014. It had, however, then made it mandatory for seed companies, research institutions and scientists to first take approval from the state on where they wanted to go for field trials.
