BAREILLY/PILIBHIT: Two policemen were suspended after it was discovered that   masterminds Gurjeet Ladda and   had allegedly secured passports on fake documents in Pilibhit.

 Ladda was arrested on September 19 and fake documents made in the name of one Surjeet Singh, son of Jaspal   and resident of Sherpur village in Pilibhit, were seized from him. Pilibhit police now claims that   had also applied for a passport in August and had managed to secure fake documents too. Both men had been hiding in UP following the jail break.
 
 The revelation comes during the ongoing investigation against a top UP policeman of the rank of inspector general who was allegedly involved in a deal to let Ghanshyampura walk free after he was detained by Punjab Police and UP anti-terrorist squad. Several Khalistani terrorists said to be involved in the jailbreak were arrested during an operation earlier this month.
 
 Meanwhile, police have issued a lookout notice for Pilibhit lawyer Narendra Singh Mahal saying he was involved in getting Ladda and Ghanshyampura fake documents.
