PATNA: The ritualistic ‘dahi-chura’ feast on the auspicious occasion of Makar Sankranti will not be held at 10, Circular Road residence of former CM and RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s wife   this year. RJD insiders said the annual celebrations have been called off owing to imprisonment of Lalu and recent death of his elder sister Gangotri Devi.

 Normally, 10, Circular Road, the residence of Lalu’s wife and former   CM   Devi, remains abuzz with activities on Makar Sankranti day, which is likely to be observed either on January 14 or 15 this year.
 
 “Lalu family is observing mourning period for the death of his elder sister till January 22. Accordingly, there will be no celebrations for Makar Sankranti at 10, Circular Road this time,” said  , president of the women cell of RJD. 
 
 She added a number of RJD functionaries and workers have also vowed not to celebrate Makar Sankranti this year in view of the “crisis” being faced by Lalu. “I will personally not celebrate any festival till Lalu ji comes out of jail,” Abha said.
 
 Last year, a big feast was organised at Lalu’s residence on Makar Sankranti with Rabri and her eldest daughter Misa Bharti looking after the preparations. Lalu also greeted party functionaries and dignitaries, including CM  , who was then in alliance with RJD.
 
 Though Lalu family will not celebrate Makar Sankranti festival this time, many senior functionaries of other parties, including JD (U)’s state president Bashishtha Narayan Singh, are gearing up for throwing grand ‘dahi-chura’ feasts. Elaborate preparations are being made at Bashishtha’s residence in Patna and party workers from across the state are expected to arrive with curd, beaten rice, tilkut and other items for the feast.
