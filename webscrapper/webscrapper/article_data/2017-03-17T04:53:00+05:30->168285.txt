Nagpur: City police on Thursday had a harrowing time tackling tricksters who targeted motorists and decamped with their valuables. All incidents happened in an hour’s span and in a radius of 3 kms. 

 While four offences have been registered, one of the victims decided not to file a complaint. Two offences have been registered at Dhantoli and Sitabuldi police stations each. 
 
 In the first incident at Dhantoli, a family from Madhya Pradesh was targeted. Parvati Singh Thakur was waiting in the car as her husband and son had gone inside a private hospital when the tricksters distracted her. As Parvati stepped out to collect some “fallen currencies”, the miscreants decamped with her purse in which valuables worth Rs28,000 was kept. 
 
 In the second incident, a laptop of Mumbai-based Bhushan Bhavsar was stolen from the car on Abhyankar Road when he stepped into an eatery. The miscreants distracted Bhavsar’s driver Dharmaraj Karade who stepped out of the car and then decamped with the laptop bag. An offence was registered at Sitabuldi police station. 
 
 Another laptop was stolen from Ramdaspeth in the same fashion.
