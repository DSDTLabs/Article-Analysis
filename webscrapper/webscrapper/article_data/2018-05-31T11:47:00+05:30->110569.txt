HYDERABAD: Roads under the   ( ) were closed without following due procedures laid down in Section 258 of Cantonments Act, 2006.

 
 The orders issued by then defence minister Manohar Parrikar on January 7, 2015 did not follow the established rules under the Act.
 
 
 In November 2015, a civilian ward member of SCB attempted to raise the issue of rules to be followed while closing roads, but the board president did not allow him. The issue of road closure is likely to figure in the SCB meeting scheduled for Thursday.
 
 The new rules make it clear that no fresh temporary closure order of the same road will be permitted without prior ratification by MoD. MoD has also instructed that to maintain orderly traffic and ensuring speeding limits within the Cantonments, the   may place rumble strips /road safety features at locations as deemed appropriate.
 
 “All road closures in Cantonments should be reviewed every year by the   and a report should be submitted to the GOC and MoD,” the official order said.
 
 The Director-General, Defence Estates, (DGDE) will publish a report annually on closure of roads and the same will also be uploaded on the website of MoD.
 
 The new orders will supersede the orders issued on January 7, 2015.
 
 The draft for road closure should also be put in the website of Cantonment Board inviting claims/ objections/ suggestions from the public.
