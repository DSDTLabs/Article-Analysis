JAIPUR: After successful relocation of tiger RT-91, the state wildlife department will soon bring 116 spotted deer (cheetal) from   (New Delhi) to Darrah range of   (MHNP).

 The department is now focusing on augmentation of the prey base, before releasing the tiger in 82 sqkm wild area.
 
 The wildlife department on Wednesday received the nod from the   (CZA) to shift these deer to MHNP. “ We have received the permission from CZA to shift deer from presidential house, New Delhi. To add to the prey base, the exercise to bring deer will be started soon,” said deputy conservator of forest T Mohanraj.
 
 Spotted dear, which is a species native to the Indian subcontinent, will be released in 8,000 sq metre enclosed area developed by the MHNP administration.
 
 The wildlife conservationists earlier had voiced concerns over inadequate prey base before releasing the tigers in the reserve. The prey base was a major concern as it was available only in pockets. Augmentation of prey base was necessary as tiger can find rich prey only in Jhamra pocket of Darrah.
 
 A senior forest department official said, “We have proposed to release more than 250 cheetals in MHNP. Once the cheetals are brought from New Delhi, the department will also shift more herbivorous animals from Bikaner and Kota zoos. The process to take permission for shifting has been started.”
 
 Meanwhile, the state wildlife department is constantly monitoring the tiger after it was released in 28-hectare enclosure at MHNP.
 
 The department is planning to release tiger in the wild 15 days later after it gets acclimatize to the new area. Minister for environment and forest   said, “The tiger is in good shape. After monitoring the fouryear-old tiger for 15 days, gates of the enclosure will be opened.”
 
 A source said, “RT-9 is perfectly healthy. However, it did not make any kill till Wednesday evening.”
