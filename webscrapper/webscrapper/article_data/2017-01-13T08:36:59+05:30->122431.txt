AHMEDABAD: In an attempt to enforce discipline in the police force, city   has issued directions to all policemen who   to wear helmets while driving. 

 Sources said the pillion rider would also have to wear the helmet while on bike. Recently during a routine inspection of the   footages installed at various locations in the city, Singh came across a few pictures in which policemen in uniform were driving two-wheelers without the helmets.
 
 “When we as policemen ask and urge two-wheeler riders to wear helmets and even fine them for flouting the  , how can we ourselves break the law,” said a senior police official. Singh has even issued a strict warning that if a policeman is caught on the camera driving a two-wheeler without the helmet, he will be issued a memo. 
 
 “If the policeman violating the helmet norm fails to pay the fine, then he will have to face a departmental action,” added the official.
