Prabhakar of Perambur, was involved in centring work on one of the pillars of the flyover when the accident took place at 7 pm, police said.

 Prabhakar's fellow workers took him to Government Royapettah Hospital where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival, he said.
 
 The officer said, just prior to the accident, Deepak repeatedly lost his balance while standing on makeshift scaffolding and at tempting to connect two rods atop the pillar. Prabhakar decided to help him and fell to his death.
