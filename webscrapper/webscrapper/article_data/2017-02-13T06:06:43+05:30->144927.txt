NASHIK: The   (RPF) and police have started a probe into who had kept a cement milestone on the train tracks near Kherwadi.

 Passengers of the Mumbai-bound   had a narrow escape early on Saturday morning, when the train hit a cement milestone on the tracks near the Kherwadi railway station, about 18 km from   railway station.
 
 Railway officials did not rule out a sabotage attempt, saying that the milestone was uprooted from somewhere and deliberately placed on the track. What lent credence to the railway officials’ suspicion of sabotage is the fact that the Amritsar-Mumbai (CST)   had passed through the spot just about half-an-hour before the engine of Shalimar Express hit the cement slab.
 
 RPF inspector general A K Shrivastav told TOI that teams of the force and the local police will investigate to find out those behind the incident. Senior division security commissioner in-charge, Ram Pawar, who is the principal of   (RPF) here, visited the site on Sunday to inspect the spot.
 
 “The RPF is preparing a report that will document everything in details. The report about the incident and will be presented to the senior authorities,” a senior RPF officer said.
 
 A senior officer from the Divisional Railway Manager’s (DRM) office in Bhusawal said, “We will conduct meetings with the police-patils of villages along the railway tracks. The aim is to build a rapport with the people their and also improve intelligence gathering.”
 
 A police officer said, “If Pathankot train had passed the same spot about half-an-hour ago, it means there is someone who knows the in and out of the bridge tablet (concrete milestone fixed on bridge) and executed the act.”
