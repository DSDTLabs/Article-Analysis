PANAJI: The state government has informed the Union mines ministry that 160   leases in Goa will have to be auctioned when these are due to expire in 2020. The Union mines ministry has asked the state government to start auctioning of mining leases from July 1, 2019. 

 Goa has the highest number of leases to be auctioned in 2020, followed by   (45) and Odisha (30). The auctioning of mining leases would be discussed at the 5th national meet to be held in Goa on January 19. The Union mines minister is expected to attend the meeting to be organised by the ministry of mines. 
 
 In a letter to the state governments, Arun Kumar, secretary, ministry of mines said that the states must be aware that a total of 348 non-captive mining leases will expire on March 31, 2020 under section 8(6) of the MMDR (amendment) Act, 2015.
 
 To ensure that there is no fall in production in the mineral sector, it is important that there is an orderly transition of these expiring mining leases to the new lessees by way of auctioning as per the MMDS Act, 1957.
 
 The ministry of mines had requested the state to prepare an action plan for the leases expiring in 2020 and submit it to the ministry. It has asked the state government to submit the plan, which includes finalisation of exploration proposals, exploration within the   hold areas by the lessee, identification of agency for exploration outside of lease areas (if required), finalisation of geological reports and carrying out   of the mines.
 
 The mines ministry stated that though the leases expire on March 31, 2020, it would be appropriate for the states to start the process of auctioning the mines by July 1, 2019 as it will give the successful bidders time to mobilise as well as to obtain various clearances before commencing mining operations. The ministry also stated that ‘it is therefore of utmost importance that an action plan for auctioning these expiring leases is prepared at the earliest.’ 
 
 During the Portuguese regime, Goa had 806 mining concessions, and in 1987 after the concessions were abolished and converted into leases, this number had reduced to 595 leases. In 1987-88 and in 2000, 438 lease holders had applied for the first renewal. Subsequently, 413 lease holders had applied in 2006 for second renewal.
 
 Out of 595 valid mining leases in Goa, the state government cancelled 252 mining leases of those lease holders who had not applied during the first or second renewal of mining leases in 1987-88 and 2006-2007 respectively. On October 2013, 119 mining leases were cancelled, while another 133 were cancelled in November 2013.
