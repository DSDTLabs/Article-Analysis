NASHIK: The city   have seized demonetised currency notes of Rs 99.95 lakh from a multi-utility vehicle at Dwarka on Monday and detained five people, including four jewelers. Police also seized the MUV and a scooter, which one of the suspects -- the agent -- was riding. The suspects have been booked under Section 102 of the CrPC (power of police to   property)

 Deputy commissioner of police (Zone I) Laxmikant Patil said the initial investigations have suggested that one of the suspects had promised the jewellers to get the demonetised notes exchanged with new currency notes for a commission. Hence, the four jewellers had gathered the money and were on their way to get it exchanged.
 
 Around noon on Monday, the Mumbai Naka police received a tip that a large quantity of   were supposed to be exchanged in some part of the city and the vehicle carrying the cash would pass through Dwarka. 
 
 Police immediately laid a trap at Dwarka and around 12.30pm, zeroed in on MUV. Police intercepted the MUV, detained the four jewellers and seized the notes. 
 
 The agent who had allegedly promised to exchange the scrapped notes was following the MUV on his scooter. He was also detained.
 
 Patil said the detained jewellers were unable to exchange the old notes during the period given by the government. So, they had got in touch with the agent to get the notes exchanged.
 
 Patil said the seized notes were of Rs 99.95 lakh. While Rs 67.50 lakh were notes of Rs 500 denomination, the remaining were of Rs 1,000 denomination.
 
 Police said they suspected that the alleged agent was running a racket for exchanging scrapped notes with the help of another suspect. We will soon find out from where he was arranging the valid currency notes, Patil said.
 
 Police will also be checking the source of income of the suspects and find out from where had they collected the scrapped notes in such huge quantity.
