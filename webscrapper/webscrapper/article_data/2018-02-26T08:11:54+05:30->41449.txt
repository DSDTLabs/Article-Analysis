GURUGRAM: MCG has earned Rs 72.17 crore as revenue from outdoor advertising in Gurugram over the last five years, between 2012-13 and 2016-17. 

 In 2016-17, the total advertising revenue earned was Rs 16.07 crore, an increase of around 33% over 2012-13, when it was Rs 12.01 crore. 
 
 These were revealed in a Haryana   meeting held to review various MCG development works December 13 in Gurugram.
 
 The figures though showed advertising revenues had dropped to around Rs 7 crore in 2015-16, around the same time when the litigation to scrutinise the policy began. Between 2016, when the   advertisement by-laws were added to the policy and now, multiple amendments have been made. The final by-laws are currently being discussed.
 
 “As soon as the state approves the advertisement by-laws, contracts will be allocated through e-tendering,” said a senior MCG official. The numbers were revealed in a reply to enquires by the   committee on   and urban local bodies, into MCG’s advertising revenue and policies. Among other things, the committee had asked for details on the much-talked-about MCG property scam. 
 
 A response in this regard has also been submitted to the committee, giving details of the current status of the case. “We said out of the total 94 cases, we’ve recovered property taxes from 87 owners. In addition, Gurugram police sought details on the procedure, which we have furnished,” he added. 
 
 TOI had earlier reported that the Vidhan Sabha committee had asked MCG to submit a detailed report on the MCG property tax scam, in which some MCG officials had conspired to allow some property owners to pay lower property taxes.
 
 The meeting also saw discussions on the new waste management plan, city bus service, MCG’s advertising policy, encroachments near the ammunition depot and the LED street-lighting project. It was chaired by Ambala MLA   and attended by four other MLAs, including   from Gurugram, as well as MCG officials and a mayoral team.
