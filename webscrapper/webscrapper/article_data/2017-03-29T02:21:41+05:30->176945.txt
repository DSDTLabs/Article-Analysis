GURUGRAM: The newly formed   of the   (AGRF) discussed 14 issues related to   in its first meeting on Tuesday. Most of the cases were related to delay in handover of possession.

 Senior officials of the department of town and country planning (DTCP) heard homebuyers’ grievances and directed the developers to address their concerns in the day-long meeting. “We had a detailed discussion with the buyers and developers. As buyers put forth their grievances, the developers were asked to present the status of their projects and the reason for delay,” said a senior official of DTCP, adding that builders were directed to speed up construction work of their respective projects to ensure early possession.
 
 In light of increasing number of complaints of   against real estate projects and developers, deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh constituted a seven-member sub-committee of AGRF in February. Senior town planner of DTCP was named chairman of the sub-committee, district town planner (planning) its member secretary, while superintendent engineers of Huda and DHBVN/HVPNL and district town planners (enforcement) of DTCP and MCG were made its members. 
 
 The move was aimed at speedy disposal of complaints and continuous monitoring of delayed projects.
 
 Chandrika Jaitely, president of Universal Aura Welfare Association, said, “We hope that DTCP’s intervention will help us in getting possession of our house,” adding that the delay in possession was hitting them financially as they were having to pay EMI as well as rent.
 
 In September 2015, the state government had constituted the AGRF in Gurgaon under the chairmanship of deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh, to solve the problems of buyers in private developer areas in a time-bound manner. 
 
 Since then, the forum held four meetings — once in September 2015, then in January, August and September 2016 — and took up more than 150 complaints.
