KOCHI: The   has dismissed a petition challenging the decision of   (VACB) to drop further proceedings in   in which a Rs5 crore bribery allegation was raised against a close aide of former   Elamaram Kareem.

 The court considered a petition filed by VP Moideenkutty of Narikkuni in Kozhikode, who was the complainant before VACB, alleging that the decision not to conduct a probe was taken despite a preliminary inquiry revealing that offences were committed.
 
 While declining to interfere, the high court said the complainant could have taken further steps as per the Code of Criminal Procedure instead of directly approaching it unnecessarily.
 
 In December 2013, state government had directed for constituting a special team of VACB officials to conduct an enquiry on complaints regarding granting of mining clearances for Hospet, Karnataka-based MSPL Ltd in 741.605 hectares of land in Chakkittapara, Mavoor, and Kakkoor villages in Kozhikode.
 
 As per the petition, the VACB team had found that the mining clearances were obtained by the private company using undue influences and that the permits were granted disregarding the objection raised by the forest department. 
 
 However, VACB had decided not to proceed with a probe by pointing out that no loss was caused to the exchequer and that nobody obtained any undue gains from the deal. In the petition, the complainant had alleged that he had filed a representation to VACB against this decision but no action was taken.
 
 Along with dismissing the petition, the high court said as VACB had conducted an enquiry on the basis of the petitionerâ€™s first complaint, he should have resorted to further proceedings on its basis. Filing yet another complaint and then approaching the high court was not what was required, the court said. The court clarified that its judgment will not stand in the way of the petitioner seeking further proceedings on the basis of his first complaint.
