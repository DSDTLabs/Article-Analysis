MUMBAI: Besides returning from the   with a new personal best marathon time,   believes he and the other Indian runners who ran the 42k event also returned richer from a life-altering experience which the armyman hopes can inspire other running talent coming through the military ranks.

 Nitendra Singh Rawat,   and Ram, who completed the top three podium in that order at last year's  , all qualified for the Rio Games. While Rawat was a surprise disappointment, finishing a lowly 84th in 2:22:52, Gopi T (2:15:25) and Ram (2:15:26) were at least able to set new personal best timings. But that was just part of a bigger gain from the trip according to Ram. "What we felt being on that platform is that we (Indians) too need to show we can do something in sport. And to also show those who are coming through the ranks that they if they are willing to do what's necessary, they too can see their lives transformed by such an experience," Ram said here on Friday.
 
 The impact of his maiden Olympic appearance was also felt in his home town in Rajasthan, said the 30-year-old naib subedar, as he reflected on the gruelling journey that came before the gruelling run in Brazil. "We felt that all the hard work we put in, we were able to reap the fruits of it," said Ram, who is based at the Army Sports Institute in Pune. "I felt happy, so also my colleagues at the ASI as well as my family. Many people back home don't even know what sports is. But now they are beginning to understand."
