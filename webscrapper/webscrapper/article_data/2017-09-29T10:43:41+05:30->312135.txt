BENGALURU: One of the key factors in India's 3-0 lead in the series before Thursday's loss, which snapped their nine-match ODI winning streak, was their bowling in the death overs which   and Jasprit Bumrah, the pace duo who were rested for the match, did commendably.

 But   and   couldn't quite curtail the scoring rate although Yadav picked up a couple of wickets in the business end. Asked if in hindsight skipper   would have a rethink on the team composition, he replied in the negative and backed his bowlers.
 
 Kohli said: “We've won the series, so you need to test your bench strength as well and give those guys game time. I think Umesh and Shami bowled well. Umesh even picked up four wickets and it would have been a bit more than what he would have expected himself. But we only lost by 20-odd in the end. So we didn't bat that badly. I think the wicket was really good to bat on.”
