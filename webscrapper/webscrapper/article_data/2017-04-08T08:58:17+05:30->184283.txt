SURAT: The Surat Citizens’ Council Trust (SCCT) has demanded an   of the bank charges for the customers not maintaining   of deposits and other charges announced by the   (SBI).

 After receiving many complaints from the residents, the SCCT has written letters to Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor, Urjit Patel, for immediate rollback of bank charges. 
 
 Council submits that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched intensive campaign to provide integrated financial services to every citizen, while banks are trying to create disservice and increased hardships to depositors and customers in challenging times. 
 
 “Instead of digitization including core banking and net banking, which has minimized or reduced the cost of banking, similar announcements by SBI and other banks are increasing financial burden on user account holders. 
 
 This needs immediate proactive actions,” said president of SCCT, Sharad Kapadia.
 
 “This action of SBI is overt admission of its management inefficiency instead of efficient corporate strategy of heightened productivity and cost control,” Kapadia wrote.
