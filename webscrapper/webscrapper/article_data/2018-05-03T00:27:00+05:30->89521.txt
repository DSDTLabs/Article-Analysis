Visakhapatnam: The two   fishermen, who went to sea on Tuesday, are yet to be traced by the district administration.

 Residents of Peda Jalaripeta, the native village of the two  , are fast losing hope. Though coast guard chopper and marine cops were pressed into action, the bodies could not be found. The searches on Wednesday went in vain just as Tuesday.
 
 It may recalled that seven fishermen in two boats were marooned 17 nautical miles into the sea when lightning struck. One of them, Chintapalli Pola Rao, (35) who was on a country-made boat as lightning struck him. Two others on the other boat close drowned and were missing since then. They were identified as Teddu Pentaiah (45) and Teddu Parasayya (25).
 
 According to sources, the body of Pola Rao was fished out by the rescue teams on Tuesday evening. It was brought back in the midnight. Doctors at KGH conducted post-mortem and it was kept in the freezer for the arrival of Pola Rao’s brother from Kuwait.
 
 One of the five fishermen along with the missing two - Pentaiah and Parasayya on the same boat, R Appa Rao told media persons that it was rebirth to him. He along with Ramu and Teddu Tataji was on the same boat of Parasayya, Pentaiah. “I have faced really horrifying moments in my life in the sea. We all fell down from the boat and we three managed to reach the boat in few minutes, but Parasayya and Pentiah were missed,” Appa Rao said.
 
 The elders of the Pedajalaripeta area say that retrieving bodies from the sea would be impossible. They said around 50 fishermen of their area were missed in the sea in the past three decades and only 10 bodies were fished out. 
 
 The Visakha East MLA Velagapudi Ramakrishna Babu visited Pedjalaripeta and consoled the families of the missing fishermen and also deceased Pola Rao’s family. He handed over Rs. 10,000 to each family. Joint Collector G Srijana and few other officers had visited the Pedajalaripeta on Tuesday evening.
