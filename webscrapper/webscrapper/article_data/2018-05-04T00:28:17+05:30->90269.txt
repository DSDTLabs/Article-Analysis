Coimbatore: Three youngsters were arrested on Thursday for gangraping a 25-year-old woman from Dharmapuri at knifepoint at a private hotel at Sathram in Salem on April 29.

 The arrested were identified as David alias Naym, 25, of Alagapuram in Salem, his brother Nabeez, 29, of Kamarajar Nagar Colony and their friend Ranjith Kumar, 23, from Kamarajar Nagar Colony.
 
 According to police, Naym befriended the woman, who hails from Morappur in Dharmapuri, when her grandfather was admitted to the Salem government hospital. Naym, whose relative was also admitted to the hospital, had helped her then.
 
 The woman, who was married and separated, shared her details with Naym and the two developed friendship and often used to talk over phone, the police said.
 
 “Naym invited the woman to Salem on April 29 and spent the day at Yercaud. At night, he made the woman stay at a private hotel at Sathram. Naym then took her ATM card and went out to buy food. While returning, he brought Nabeez and Ranjith Kumar to the hotel. The three threatened the woman at knifepoint and raped her. They also warned her against lodging a police complaint and sent her back to Dharmapuri in a train after withdrawing Rs 28,000 using her ATM card,” an investigation officer said.
 
 When her cousin came to know about the incident, he informed his friend in Salem. With the help of a woman’s organisation, his friend lodged a complaint with the Salem police commissioner on Wednesday evening.
 
 The police registered a case and arrested the three on Thursday. The trio was produced before a local court, which remanded them in judicial custody.
 
 The woman was, meanwhile, treated at the Salem government hospital and sent back home.
