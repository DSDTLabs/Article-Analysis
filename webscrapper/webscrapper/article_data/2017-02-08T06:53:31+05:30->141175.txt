SURAT: The   of the BJP was flagged off from the religious town of Unai in Navsari district by chief minister   on Tuesday. 

 Rupani offered prayers at   temple soon after his arrival and said Adivasi Vikas Gaurav Yatra was not to garner votes. Addressing a public meeting, he referred to Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act and said all the produce of the forest belongs to the tribals. The chief minister said at least 80,000 Adivasis have been provided with land by the BJP government in the state and now it plans to open a medical college in Dahod-Panchmahal for their benefit. A number of ITIs together having 30,000 seats will be set up by the BJP government for the Adivasi youth, the chief minister said, lambasting the previous Congress governments for not setting up a science school in the tribal-dominated areas of state.
 
 “Notebandi and darubandi have done wonders for Adivasi people. Many have given up their addiction for liquor. Adivasis are on way to progress. A tribal man was forced to take the body of his dead wife on his shoulders in Odisha and such incidents would not be allowed to happen in Gujarat,” the chief minister said. 
 
 BJP Gujarat Pradesh president   is leading the 12-day yatra from Unai to Ambaji. He warned Congress workers against creating troubles for the party leaders like they did in Surat recently. The yatra would cover 27 assembly constituencies which have sizeable tribal population and pass through Valsad, Navsari, Surat, Dang, Tapi, Bharuch, Narmada and Dahod before its culmination at Ambaji.
