JAIPUR: While government is demanding   cards for Centre-sponsored social benefit schemes of direct benefit transfer, there are still more than five lakh people in Jaipur district without the cards. The administration now intends to hold especial camps and encourage those who do not have Aadhaar cards to get one.

 These five lakh people, who do not have Aadhaar cards, will have to get one to avail the benefit of direct benefit transfer schemes of the Centre, if they are eligible for such schemes.
 
 According to the figures provided by the district administration, 92% people have got Aadhaar cards but there are still eight per cent without the card. The figures have been revealed by the Jaipur district administration, said department of information technology.
 
 The   UID project shows that the estimated population of Jaipur is more than 70 lakh and but nearly 65 lakh people have got their Aadhaar cards.
 
 “Since there are a lot many people left without Aadhaar cards, we will hold camps in the districts along with ‘Nyay Apke Dwar’ being organised by the state government,” the official said.
 
 For availing the centrally sponsored scheme of direct benefit transfer, tuberculosis patients in the state are being asked to provide their Aadhaar cards. The TB patients will be linked to government’s direct benefit transfer ( ) scheme during two-month-long ‘Mera Gaon Swasthya Gaon’ launched in the state in May.
 
 A TB patient has to submit his Aadhaar card details and upload it on Nikshay portal to link the patient with DBT scheme. Without Aadhaar cards, he will not get the benefit of the scheme. Under DBT scheme, the TB patients will get Rs 500 per month during the treatment notified in NIKSHAY under   (RNTCP).
 
 Besides, there are other such DBT schemes, for which Aadhaar card is mandatory and those who do not have one, will not get the benefit unless they get the card from the camps being organised in the state till end of June.
