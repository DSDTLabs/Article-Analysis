VADODARA: She always loved visiting   and learning about   connected with them. But two years ago, city-based Prarthi Shah thought of taking an initiative for not just promoting heritage sites across the globe but also spread awareness about them among people. And that is when the idea of starting ‘Heritage Selfie’ drive struck her. 

 Shah began an online campaign wherein she asked her friends and other heritage lovers to click their selfies with the heritage sites and post them on social networking sites. “Selfies have become a rage now among all age groups and people often post photos of their visits to different places. What would be a better idea than encouraging people to click their selfies with heritage sites and post them online,” Shah told TOI. She initiated the campaign by posting her photos with heritage sites she visited across the country.
 
 “It soon picked up among my friends who began posting their selfies with hashtag of Heritage Selfies of the spots they visited. Many people often don’t know several heritage sites around their city or in other parts of the country. This selfie campaign has helped spread awareness about such spots. Those posting such selfies often get queries about the location of the sites,” Shah, a student of Centre for Heritage Management in Ahmedabad, added. 
 
 Those posting the photos are also asked to describe the place in a few lines. 
 
 “This is not just about heritage monuments. I encouraged people to post about natural heritage, festivals, food and attires as well. I now want to take this project to the next level by carrying out an on ground campaign,” Shah said. She is planning to promote the city’s heritage by running a campaign to post photos with the heritage spots here.
