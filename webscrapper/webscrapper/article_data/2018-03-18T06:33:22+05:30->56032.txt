LUCKNOW: A businessman was shot at by his former business partner inside his furniture showroom in Vibhuti Khand,   on Saturday. 

 The accused, Ashutosh Jaiswal, is the son of a former   chairperson from Deoria. 
 
 He shot at 28-year-old Durgesh Tiwari in his showroom allegedly over a dispute of Rs 3 crore. The staff chased and nabbed the attacker and his driver while they were trying to flee. Police are interrogating them.
 
 Tiwari is undergoing treatment at KGMU trauma centre. Dr Sandeep Tewari told TOI that an operation to dislodge a bullet from Tiwari's head is under way. According to the police, Tiwari and Jaiswal, both residents of Riverview Apartments in Gomtinagar and native to Deoria, were business partners for a long time.
 
 Around 5pm, Jaiswal reached Tiwari's showroom to settle the long-standing monetary dispute. During negotiation, an altercation ensued and Jaiswal shot at Tiwari from a close range. 
 
 As Tiwari slumped, his friend   tried to overpower Jaiswal but he fired in the air and fled, said the police. As Jaiswal ran outside, Gautam called the police and the staff raised an alarm to nab him and his driver. 
 
 Constable Deepak Yadav, who was around, also chased the miscreants and finally nabbed them near Husadiya crossing. SP (north)   said both were in a dispute for long. 
 
 "Jaiswal was pressuring Tiwari to pay cash he owed him," he said. His pistol has been taken in custody, he added.
 
 "The victim has suffered firearm injuries on his left temple and is under treatment. His condition is critical," he said. SSP Lucknow Deepak Kumar has rewarded constable Yadav with Rs 5,000 for nabbing the miscreants.
