PATNA: In a rare display of bonhomie, PM   and Bihar CM   shared several lighter moments during the 350th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Gobind Singh at   in Patna on Thursday and praised each other on the prohibition issue.

 Nitish's JD(U) had walked out of an alliance with BJP over Modi's projection as PM candidate for the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, leading to bitterness between the two parties. However, the two leaders' praise for each other on Thursday was in sharp contrast to Modi's attacks during BJP's 'Hunkar Rally' from the very same Gandhi Maidan more than three years ago when, without naming Nitish, he had called him an “opportunist“ and “backstabber“.
 
 Speaking on prohibition, while Nitish recalled how Modi, as Gujarat CM for 12 years, continued with the strict   there, the PM greeted the Bihar CM for taking the “courageous“ step towards “social reform“.
 
 “Prohibition is a social cause and its implementation is not only government's responsibility . Everyone, including political parties, social workers and common people, should support it to make it successful,“ PM said, asking people to make liquor ban a grand success so that Bihar could inspire the entire country .
 
 Nitish is among the handful of opposition CMs who has vocally backed Modi's demonetisation move, a stand that has improved relations between the two stalwarts.Significantly, Nitish's close aide Sanjay Jha chose the very day of the new-found camaraderie between the two OBC leaders to deny that the then Nitish government had neglected the security arrangement for “Hunkar Rally“ in October 2013, which was targeted by Indian Mujahideen.
