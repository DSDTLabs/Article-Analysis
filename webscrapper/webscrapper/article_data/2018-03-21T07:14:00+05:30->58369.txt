GREATER NOIDA: In what may bring respite to many buyers in affordable housing projects of  , the   is mulling an increase in the time period from two months to six months for   to get the lease deed executed after land allotment.

 The proposal will be floated in the next board meeting of Yeida slated for April, officials said.
 
 The proposal is being considered in view of the lack of development of areas due to the delay in execution of afforable housing projects because of land acquisition and subsequent litigation by local farmers in Sector 22D who had refused to part with their land.
 
 However, the issues have now been resolved and facilities like approach road, electrification, etc are being provided, leading to the beginning of registry of flats.
 
 Shailendra Bhatia, officer on special duty to Yeida, told TOI that in case, “the proposal is approved, the allottees for the 5,100 four-storeyed houses being offered in Sector 22D under the affordable housing project” will be able to get lease deed executed within six months rather than 60 days. 
 
 “This will help the allottees buy time in case they have not been able to register houses on time. We are bringing this proposal in the next board meeting,” he said.
