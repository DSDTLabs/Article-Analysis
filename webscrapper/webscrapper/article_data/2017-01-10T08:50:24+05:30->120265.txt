JAIPUR: Congress's Rajasthan unit chief   on Monday said the savings of women have come under tax ambit after demonetisation, a decision which he termed as “economic terrorism” on the people.

 He was addressing a protest gathering organised by the party's state women’s wing against the scrapping of old notes.
 
 Demonetisation has affected the day-to-day life of poor families and over one crore people have lost their jobs, Pilot claimed, adding that women were facing problems in running their households due to the scarcity of money in banks and ATMs.
 
 Terming demonetisation as “economic terrorism” being carried out on the people, the former Union minister said these problems occurred due to the “immature decision” to ban high denomination currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.
 
 “There is no end to the woes of people even after 60 days of the move,” he claimed.
 
 While the common man stood in bank queues, black money of big industrialists and BJP leaders was getting easily converted into white.
 
 “People do not have money in their hands and inflation is on the rise,” he said.
