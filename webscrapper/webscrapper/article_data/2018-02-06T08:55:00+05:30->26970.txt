Noida: Hundreds of e-rikshaw drivers protested against the seizure of illegal vehicles by the transport department on Monday. The protesters under the umbrella of ‘e-rickshaw chalak vikas samiti’ raised slogans outside the city magistrate’s office.

 “Over 80 vehicles that were seized were without a registration number and sales tax certificate. We had purchased these vehicles from   dealers. At that point of time, none of them issued documents like sales tax certificate, etc. Now, all of them have been issued a temporary certificate by the transport department. This has not helped us,”  , president of the samiti told TOI.
 
 The drivers gathered at the office of the city magistrate Mahendra   after which the Singh had to accept their memorandum. They were joined by former Samajwadi Party candidate   who serves as the patron of the samiti.
 
 In the memorandum, the samiti has sought free homes and insurance coverage from the government and called for “no harassment at the hands of the traffic police and the transport department”.
 
 They left after the city magistrate assured them that their memorandum will be forwarded to the state government.
