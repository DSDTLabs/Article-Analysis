PUNE: More than half the   currently held in captivity at the   may no longer be fit for the  .

 Officials say 34 leopards are currently at the centre, which is located near Junnar in Pune district. As many as 24 of them are too tame for their natural habitat.
 
 Leopards are naturally used to hunting in the wild. However, spending too much time in captivity can make them too domesticated. They would be unable to fend for themselves if they’re freed. Releasing such animals can also increase the risk of man-animal conflict, many experts said.
 
 Ajay Deshmukh, senior veterinary officer at the centre, said, “Our aim is to always treat animals and release them soon after they are fit. But there are various reasons for a leopard to have been kept for a long time. Some are identified as being a threat to humans; in a few cases, they may have been hand-reared since they were 2 to 3 months old. Then there are animals that are severely handicapped. But a few were just not released on time.”
 
 The centre began operations in 2002. “Back then, at least nine leopards captured in and around Borivali were brought here by the forest department. However, due to lack of proper release protocols or training in place at the time, they had been left in captivity, instead of being released into the wild in a short time,” he said.
 
 Now, the oldest of the leopards at the centre is around 22 years old. “After nearly 13 to 14 years of captivity, the animal’s natural behaviour changes. From having to hunt its prey in the wild, the animal gets used to being fed by humans. This can be dangerous,” Deshmukh said.
 
 “If such an animal is released into the wild, they may once again go looking for food and safety in a human settlement. People will not understand this and will panic. This increases the risk of conflict. So we cannot let that happen,” he said.
 
 For such animals, there is no solution in sight as yet.
