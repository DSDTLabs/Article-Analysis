JABALPUR: It was a moment of joy for the   when Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the name of Jabalpur’s   in ‘Mann ki baat’ discourse on Sunday.

 Calling hers ‘a very interesting phone call’, the PM – on the issue of red beacon – said: “One can discern from this phone call that common men detest these tendencies. They feel distanced.” He said the decision to remove red beacons has made a change in almost everyone’s life. He added now that the red beacon has been unmounted from vehicles, it should also be removed from people’s minds.
 
 To the PM, Shiva said: “Namaskar Pradhan Mantri ji, I’m Shivaa Choubey calling from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. I wish to say something on the government’s ban on red beacons.
 
  I read a line in a newspaper, ‘Every Indian is a VIP on the road’. It made me feel very proud. I am glad that today, even my time is equally important. I don’t have to be caught in a traffic jam and I don’t have to stop for anyone as well.
 
 I want to thank you from the core of my heart for this decision. And the Swachch Bharat Campaign that you have launched will not only clean our country, it will get rid of the VIP hegemony from our roads. Many thanks for that.” Shiva, who hails from Jabalpur’s Bandaria Tiraha, studied at Saint Aloysius School. Now, lives with her husband in Muscat, Oman.
 
 Shiva’s paternal aunt, Dr Vijayalaxmi Chaubey, a cardiologist, lives in Jabalpur along with her parents, said: “Though Shiba lives in a foreign country, she’s an Indian by heart. She keeps a vigil on the social and political developments of the country.”
