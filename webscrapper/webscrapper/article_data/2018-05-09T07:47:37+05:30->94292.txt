BELAGAVI: Considering the increasing number of cases where women’s safety has come under threat in the country today, the slogan ‘Beti Padhao- Beti Maro’ fits the present Modi-led   government instead of ‘Beti Padhao- Beti Bachao’, said senior Congress leader  .

 Azad told reporters here on Tuesday that rape cases against girl children have rapidly increased in the past 2-3 years. “The matter of concern is that FIRs are being registered against BJP leaders. BJP is a thick skinned party and it didn’t initiate action against leaders concerned despite an FIR being registered in such sensitive cases,” he said.
 
 The Rajya Sabha member said poor,   and youths are disappointed with Prime Minister Narendra   as he did not fulfil the promises made to them during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, especially in connection to black money, price rise and employment.
 
 Azad said most people opened Jan Dhan bank accounts with the hope of getting Rs 15 lakh but as on date, half of the accounts have been closed and there are no transactions in the rest.
 
 “Prices of consumable items has reached the peak. In respect to employment, Modi assured of creating two crore jobs every year. But according to figures of the Union labour department, this government has given 3.5 lakh jobs in past three and half years, he alleged.
