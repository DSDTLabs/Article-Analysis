Mumbai:   has said that its   (AoA) requires the approval of a majority of Tata Trusts nominees on strategic decisions. Before the amendment to the   in 2014, the nod of all Tata Trusts nominees was needed for board decisions. Tata Trusts is the largest shareholder of Tata Sons with a stake of 66%. 

 Tata Sons was responding to a January 3 TOI report titled “I spent time handling Ratan Tata’s demands: Mistry”, in which it was mentioned that the AoA referred to by Mistry was changed after he became Tata Sons chairman in 2012, empowering a majority of Tata Trusts nominees to veto any decision that Tata Sons board would want to take. The TOI report was based on the submissions made by Mistry to the National Company Law Tribunal on December 29.
 
 Tata Sons has said that the reference gives an impression that the bye-laws were changed to allow Tata Trusts to have a major say in company matters, whereas the amendment actually eased the controls requiring the assent only from a majority and not from all the nominees.
