What would you say if you found out that the security detail in your apartment is effective only if the crime rate in your area is low? It could mean that the protection offered by the security agency was not necessary. Similarly, for the longest time, high density   ( ), commonly known as “good”  , were believed to protect the body from  . New research has shown that this protection may not be unconditional.

 The study involved the analysis of data spanning 25 years from 3,590 men and women without heart disease. Levels of HDLs, triglycerides and low density lipoproteins (LDLs, or “bad” cholesterol) were estimated. Researchers studied the risk of heart disease in participants with low and high levels of HDL, with respect to levels of triglycerides and LDLs. It was expected if HDLs were indeed protective, then the risk of heart disease would be low in subjects with high levels of HDLs. In startling contrast, however, the risk of heart disease did not reduce in subjects with high HDLs, especially when their   and triglyceride levels were higher than average. In addition, the levels of HDLs could not be counted upon to consistently predict the risk of heart disease. Indeed, the levels of LDLs and triglycerides were more likely to be predictive of the risk of heart disease than HDL levels. Further, high levels of LDLs and triglycerides increased the risk of heart disease by 30-60% when compared to low levels of HDLs. Taken together, these results suggest that while HDLs may be protective, the levels of triglycerides and LDLs are likely to determine the extent of the protection.
 
 So if your latest test results show high HDL levels in your system, you may want to hold off on celebrating if LDL and triglyceride levels are high as well, because you may not be as protected from heart disease as you feel.
