LUCKNOW: None of the   of the previous government has been shelved, claimed Anoop Chand Pandey, additional chief secretary and financial commissioner of the state after the announcement of the BJP governmentâ€™s state   on Tuesday.

 Speaking to the TOI on projects and schemes of the Akhilesh Yadav government that have been shelved, Pandey said none of schemes had been done away with, rather the   schemes are being looked at with a new perspective and might be resumed later. He said many who were not entitled availed of the Samajwadi pension scheme, so once such cases have been probed, the scheme may be launched again.
 
 Pandey said whether it was Kanya Vidyadhan, free laptop distribution or the Samajwadi Pension of Rs 500 per month to 55 lakh women, none has been abandoned and might be revived in subsequent budgets. On the Poorvanchal Expressway, the additional chief secretary said HUDCO had confirmed that the project would initially release Rs 265 crore for the express highway.
 
 Pandey said it was a major challenge for the BJP government to adjust a burden of Rs 36,000 crore of farmer loan waiver in its very first annual budget, though it has been enhanced from Rs 3.47 lakh crore to Rs 3.84 lakh crore without imposing any new tax. Pandey said barring one or two sectors, allocations have not been curtailed, only diverted to different heads.
