BENGALURU: Nearly seven weeks after he quit the Congress, former Karnataka chief minister   will officially join the   on Wednesday. This will be done in the presence of BJP national president Amit Shah at the party's headquarters in New Delhi. Party sources said BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa will give the event a miss as he is busy campaigning in Nanjangud and Gundlupet ahead of the bypolls. Krishna, 84, who was external affairs minister in the   government from 2009-2012, severed his 46-year-old association with the Congress on January 28. He was apparently miffed for being side lined in the party for long, but some political observers refuse to believe it.

 Krishna was scheduled to join the BJP on March 15 but had to postpone it due to his sister's death. Though he had reached New Delhi to hold consultations with Shah and join the party , he had to rush back to Bengaluru after receiving the tragic news.
 
 Prominent BJP leaders, including H N   and R Ashok, will be present on Wednesday.
 
 Sources said the BJP state unit is eager to have Krishna on board so that he can campaign for the byelections. The party, which has a relatively weak base in the Mysuru region, is hoping to get some muscle with Krishna's entry. However, several of Krishna's former loyalists believe his entry into BJP will make no difference to them or the saffron party because he's past his prime.
 
 The BJP is planning to organize a reception for Krishna, who was the chief minister from 1999 to 2004, in Bengaluru on Thursday. He will be brought to the party's headquarters in Malleswaram (from the airport) in a grand procession.
