MUMBAI: The state’s textbook bureau has lodged a police complaint after soft copies of some of the new   made it to social messaging applications even before being printed.

 The class X syllabus is to change for the next academic year. For this, textbooks are being re-written by a board of studies set up by the state textbook bureau. While books were to be out in the market by April, for the past two days, several WhatsApp groups have been circulating copies of the science I and science II textbooks for Marathi medium students in PDF format.
 
 Sunil  , director of the bureau, said they have lodged a police complaint. “We are investigating how textbook copies made it to social media. While there will be no harm because of the incident, we want to ensure this isn’t repeated,” he said.
 
 It is the first year that class X books are being prepared by the textbook bureau instead of the education board.
 
 Teachers raised concern over selection of members to the board of studies. “The members must be selected carefully to ensure confidentiality. It is also important because the content has to be very accurate,” said a member of the board of studies.
 
 Teachers hinted that the books could have been made
 
 available for private publishers. “Guides are popular and if class X books come into the market in April, there won’t be enough time for private publishers to create guides. Those responsible must be punished,” said  , a teacher at an Andheri school. Magar, however, refuted this allegation.
 
 An official from   police station said a complaint of theft and cheating has been filed against an unidentified person.
