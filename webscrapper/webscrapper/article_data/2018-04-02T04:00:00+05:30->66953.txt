Surat: The hydraulic department of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) severed water connections of 10 bungalows in the city for wasting water. They had been issued notices several times in the past. This is the first time that the SMC has taken such a step against people who have been wasting water.  Rander zone of the civic body had received complaints of water wastage from Bhandari Bungalows at Adajan. “Each of these bungalows had a room on terrace for maids. They used to draw water for taking bath using pipes. The water used to flow down from the terrace and get collected on the road outside the houses,” said an SMC official.  The SMC had issued notices to the owners of the bungalows and asked them to stop the practice. However, they did not care, and therefore their water connections were severed on Saturday.  “This step seeks to send a message to people not to waste water. We don’t have enough water this summer and have to use it judiciously,” said SMC additional city engineer AJ Khatiwala.
