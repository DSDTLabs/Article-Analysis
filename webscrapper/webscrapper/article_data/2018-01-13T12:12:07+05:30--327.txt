LUCKNOW : Lucknow   central mess service was disrupted again on Friday after four outsiders attacked the mess staff.

 The mess workers were beaten up on Thursday evening when they refused to serve food to non-LU students. The outsiders attacked the mess workers with utensils and also vandalized the mess property. In protest, the staff refused to serve breakfast to LU hostellers on Friday. The mess service was, however, resumed in the afternoon after vice-chancellor SP Singh assured security to the staff.
 
 This was the fifth attack on the mess staff since August last year when the LU central mess was started.
  
  
 “The attackers scaled the boundary wall of the mess to enter the premises and hit the workers when they denied to cook food for them,” said chief proctor Vinod Singh.
 
 An FIR has been lodged against four unidentified persons, he added. Meanwhile, hostellers were agitated as they were not served the breakfast and lunch was also served late. “The quality of mess food is poor and same menu is served almost every day. We have paid fees for three meals per day, so it’s university’s responsibility to make arrangements,’ said BCom student and hosteller Aditya.
