Mysuru: Rejuvenation efforts, including desilting and encroachment clearance, have given a new lease of life to   of Nanjangud taluk, the home town of state PWD minister H C Mahadevappa. This lake, one of the largest in the district, has reached its full capacity after several years.

 According to locals, the lake is spread over 198 acres. “Due to silt and encroachments, this lake lost its glory a few decades ago and was looking like a small pond. But the public works department and district in-charge minister H C Mahadevappa took special interest in  . The state government released Rs 1 crore for it. As a result, the lake is looking good now,” villagers said. 
 
 This lake is part of Varuna hobli represented by chief minister Siddaramaiah. Currently, the lake has 0.55tmcft of water. 
 
 As part of lake rejuvenation, a bird sanctuary has been developed in the buffer zone. “We expect   over the next few days,” engineer Prakash, who was the in-charge of lake rejuvenation, told TOI.
 
 The department of fisheries officials said 5 lakh fishlings will be released in the lake soon. “This will convert the lake into the biggest fish production centre of the district," said an officer of the department.
 
 Former zilla panchayat member Nanjappa said lake rejuvenation will help farmers of several villages, including Mudalli, Mallarajaiahna Hundi, Hadinaru Mole, Madaiahana Hundi and Aalattur. “This lake will recharge the ground water of several surrounding villages and help improve the agricultural output,” he said.
