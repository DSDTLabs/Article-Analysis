CHENNAI: A majority of the leading multi-specialty and government hospitals in the city and its suburbs do not have ramps, making evacuation difficult in an emergency. Some medical colleges and hospitals also figure on the list of violators that came to the limelight of an inspection by the   (CMDA). 

 In an affidavit filed in the Madras high court on Friday, CMDA member secretary C Vijayaraj Kumar said, of the 210 hospitals inspected only 56 had provided ramp facilities. The Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital and   had ramps only in a few blocks. 
 
 Nine teams, each comprising deputy planners and assistant planners, had inspected 150 hospital buildings in the   (CMA) covering major hospitals. Of these, 124 hospitals were found without ramp facilities. Notices were issued on January 20, 2016, exactly a year ago, to provide ramps within 45 days. "Till date, these hospitals have not provided (ramp) facilities," the affidavit said. CMA comprises Chennai and parts of   and Tiruvallur districts on the fringes of the city. Later, an inspection carried out in 88 more hospitals in December 2016 found that none of them had the facility. The CMDA's inspection report comes in the light of the state government's guidelines framed in July 2016, mandating ramps in all hospitals built after 2007 to help evacuate patients in emergencies. 
 
 The petitioner in the case,  , said managements of many hospitals had still not understood the seriousness of evacuating patients in times of distress, despite the number of fire accidents in famous hospitals in the recent past.
 
  "Let us not wait for another disaster to happen and then regret," he said. Information about how many hospitals had started work on complying with the guidelines issued by the state government on facilitating ramps would be sought during the next hearing in April, he added.
