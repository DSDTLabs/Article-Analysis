 seems to have put his director’s hat aside to focus more on his acting ventures this year. After Aby and Oru Cinemakkaran, the actor has now signed debutant filmmaker Dileep Menon’s movie titled Aana Alaralodalaral.

 The director had earlier assisted filmmaker G Prajith in Oru Vadakkan Selfie, which Vineeth had scripted and acted in. On the upcoming movie, Dileep tells us, “It’s a village-based social satire. Vineeth plays a naadan youth in the movie, which is laced with humour.”
 
 The team will only begin shooting for the film, scripted by newcomer Sharath Balan, in August this year. “We are currently busy with the pre-production of the film, and are also on the lookout for a female lead for the film. The rest of the cast too will be finalised soon,” says the director.
 
 Meanwhile, Vineeth is currently busy with the shooting of Leo Thaddeus’ Oru Cinemakkaran, which has Rajisha Vijayan playing the female protagonist. Vineeth plays an aspiring filmmaker in the movie, which also has Anusree, Renji Panicker and Vijay Babu. The movie is produced under the banner Poetry Film House, by Siby Thottupuram and team.
