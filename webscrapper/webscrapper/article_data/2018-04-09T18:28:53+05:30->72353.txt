BHOPAL: Home minister   on Sunday ordered SPs across the state to use “all powers” to keep things under control in their respective areas in the wake of a ‘Bharat Bandh’ on April 10, reportedly called by people opposed to caste-based reservation.

 An additional 6,000 police personnel have been deployed in Gwalior-Chambal region till April 15. About 4,000 of them are in Gwalior, where three men were killed in the April 2   violence. The BSF Tekanpur academy has been put on alert there, and Gwalior administration has imposed prohibitory orders till April 20. Internet will be switched off in the region from Sunday 10pm till Tuesday 10pm. 
 
 Bhind will be under curfew till evening on April 11. Police have met local leaders and appealed for calm. Those who spread rumours or incite communal hatred will face severe action, they have warned. DGP Rishi Kumar Shukla told mediapersons that police are prepared to deal with any situation. 
 
 The violence on April 2 had led to allegations of intelligence failure, which the government denied. Dalits had called a nationwide bandh that day to oppose the alleged dilution of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Of the 10 deaths across the country, MP alone accounted for eight., four of them in Bhind. Scores were injured, including 54 policemen.
 
 The police crackdown on those involved in arson, murder and violence on April 2 continues. Gwalior police arrested two suspects on Sunday for murdering Rakesh Jatav and Deepak Jatav, and seized the guns alleged used in the killings. Video footage of the shooting had gone viral. Police examined it and identified Rishab Bhadoria of Shiv Colony and Rishi Gurjar as the shooters. Both were arrested from their homes and sent to jail custody. Police say Rishab was an NSUI worker and is a property broker. Rishi is his business partner.
