BENGALURU: The recent fires have destroyed around 100 hectares (250 acres) of forests in the state, forests minister   said on Tuesday. A major fire broke out in the Bandipur forest range and Biligiri Ranganathaswamy   and Chamarajangar areas, followed by one in the  . 

 Rai said the government has already ordered a CID probe to identify whether it was a man-made disaster or natural, and taken necessary measures to prevent and control forest fires in the region. "The chances of forest fires before the onset of summer are remote. We have strong reasons to believe there was some foul play, but we would want to wait for the CID report," the minister pointed out.
 
  He said the forest department sees involvement of the mining lobby and other vicious forces behind these fires. 
 
  "The fire lines were drawn prior to the onset of summer. The department has appointed fire watchers as part of its strategy to prevent such outbreaks. They are patrolling forest areas regularly and are immediately alerting officials in case of a fire,'' he added.
