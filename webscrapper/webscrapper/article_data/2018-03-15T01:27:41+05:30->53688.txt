NEW DELHI:   of   ( ) on Wednesday claimed in the Delhi   that they have   its   on holding protests in the varsity as they did not   access to the  .

 The office bearers of JNU Students Union (JNUSU) maintained that the 2017 HC order prohibiting protests within 100 metres of the administrative block should not be viewed technically as the spirit of the direction was to prevent obstruction of any   to the building and the same was never blocked.
 
 The submissions were made before Justice V K Rao who is hearing a plea by the university seeking contempt proceedings against the JNUSU office bearers for holding protests within 100 metres of the administrative block.
 
 The varsity, in its petition through central government standing counsel Monika Arora, alleged the office bearers violated HC’s August 9, 2017 direction. It also claimed that the protesting students had obstructed access to the administrative block.
 
 In response to the HC notice, the JNUSU office bearers told the court that other student bodies and associations, as well as a teachers group, have also held protests within 100 metres of the administrative block, but no action has been taken against them. Therefore, the 100-metre restriction should not be viewed technically, their lawyer submitted.
 
 The JNUSU students had earlier told the court that the main reason behind the protests in the varsity was not holding of academic council meetings. The court had on February 16, in an interim order, directed the JNU students not to obstruct the vice chancellor and other staff from entering the administrative block to carry out their work.
 
 The interim order was passed on JNU’s plea that the protests near the block was hampering its day-to-day functioning, including the disbursal salaries in connection with the seventh pay commission.
