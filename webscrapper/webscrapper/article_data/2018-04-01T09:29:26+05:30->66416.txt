CHENNAI:  , a Chennai-based  , has recently come out with an   model suiting Indian road conditions and the firm is planning to operate 50 buses at various locations on a pilot basis.

 
 With a variety of routes, Chennai offers an opportunity to run such a pilot project, say top officials from the firm. Other cities on the tentative pilot list are Surat in Gujarat, Tirupathi and Vishakapatnam in  .
 
 
  
  
 
 At present, the Chinese ‘fast-charging’ model – which can run for 16-18 hours after charging the battery for four hours overnight -- is widely preferred. But the two-ton batteries would restrict the number of passengers – that can be accommodated in a bus – to 32. 
 
 Also, they require a lot of space and it would be difficult to accommodate them at the already space-crunched city depots. To overcome this, the firm has come up with two alternate technologies: Swap and flash,  , head of EV & emobility solutions, Ashok Leyland, told TOI.
 
 The former suits city services, as batteries can be changed at the end of every trip. The latter involves a pantograph or guns for charging.
 
 Energy batteries, which hold power for a longer period, are used in the swap model and power batteries capable of rapid charging and discharging are fitted in the other model. Apart from this, a buffer battery – designed to pull the power from the electric grid and discharge it in no time – is provided inside the charging unit of the flash model.
 
 Without government’s subsidy, the cost per km in case of e-buses is Rs 110 and this would come down to Rs 85 once the volume goes up.
 
 “We may incur a loss while running the pilot (on non-commercial contract basis). But we would have successfully demonstrated the technology and proven the concept,” Athmanathan said.
