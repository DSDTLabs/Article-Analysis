NEW DELHI: A day after it was told to pay nearly Rs 5,000 crore as compensation to the former concessionaire of   line, Delhi Metro said it would fight the arbitration tribunal’s order. 

  would approach Delhi high court and file an objection petition, said its spokesperson  . 
 
 The Reliance Infra-led Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited was awarded over Rs 4,800 crore as termination payment, including running cost until 2012. 
 
 “DMRC is of the opinion that the termination notice issued by   was legally untenable and was against the provisions of the concessionaire agreement,” Dayal said. DMRC has stuck to this line ever since DAMEPL walked out of the project citing civil defects. 
 
 In July 2012, DAMEPL had to shut operations due to problems in the underground section of the line. It was reopened only in January 2013. “DAMEPL abandoned the project on June 30, 2013 and DMRC took over in public interest. Today, it’s carrying about four times the traffic by adopting consumer-friendly measures,” Dayal said.
 
 The line has an average ridership of 45,000 today; when DAMEPL ran it, the figure was only around 15,000. 
 
 Nevertheless, DMRC may have to pay a certain percentage of the compensation money before it can file a review petition, said an official. “In case payment is needed to be done, it will be in an escrow account with Reliance having to give a bank guarantee of an equal amount if the case goes against them in court,” he added.
