MUMBAI: Parents of an   from   put aside their own grief to donate the organs of their daughter on Monday, saving the lives of four   in the city.

 The child was admitted to Lilavati Hospital in Bandra on February 27 after she suffered a stroke. On evaluation, it was found a   (weak spot in the wall of a brain artery that protrudes outward) was responsible for the stroke. Brain aneurysms are rare in children and a ruptured aneurysm can be life-threatening.
 
 A source from the hospital said despite their best efforts the child couldn’t be saved. She was declared brain dead around 6.30 pm on Monday. “Her parents consented to donate all the major organs once they were confident of the distribution system,” said Dr Sitaram Gawde, medical superintendent.
 
 The girl’s heart was allocated to Fortis Hospital, Mulund, where it was transplanted into a 10-year-old girl. For paediatric heart failure patients, finding the right match is a huge challenge as there is hesitation even among doctors and staffers to approach grieving parents.
 
 Besides her heart, the child donor’s liver and one of the kidneys were sent to Jaslok Hospital where they were transplanted to patients. The other kidney was transplanted into a patient at Lilavati Hospital.
 
 The   programme has been doing well this year with 14 families having given their consent to donate till now. Of these, 12 successful donations have contributed to 35 life-saving transplants.
