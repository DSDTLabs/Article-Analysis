Same old lunges, squats, push-ups and leg raises just got more breezy and fun!   trainers are giving routine exercise formats a folksy spin with traditional dance workouts. Pune-based fitness expert Aarti Pandey feels foreign dance workouts like Salsa and Zumba are beginning to lose connect with fitness enthusiasts, which is keeping them away from gyms. She knew the future of fitness was in group workouts but it had to have an indigenous touch. That’s when she came up with the concept of ‘folk fitness’. The workout involved the same meditation, warm up, cardio and cool down flow but every act involved an Indian dance form.

 
 Dancercises have been around for a while. But this is taking it to another level. After enough research, Pandey came up with workable folk formats — Maharashtra folk dance Koli for the upper body workout, Gujarati Garba for cardio, Assamese Bihu to train the core (read abs) and Bhangra for a complete body exercise. “If I ask someone to do 50 squats, they may never do it or complain after completing just 10. But with this exercise, people end up doing 50 squats without even realising,” she explains. Pandey bets each one hour of folk dance workout burns almost 800 to 1,000 calories.
 
 
 Delhi-based fitness expert Kiran Sawhney is among the pioneers to use Bhangra as a workout. She says western music and aerobic steps can never produce the same intensity that the Bhangra-Punjabi music combo does. Kiran, who conducts Dandiya and Bhangra aerobic sessions, says these workouts help people connect better with fitness. “Men still shy away from Zumba and Salsa sessions. So folk workouts give them more options,” says Sawhney, adding that an hour-long Indian folk dance workout, three days a week, can correct heart rate, help shed extra flab, improve flexibility and concentration.
