SASARAM: Over ten years after banning   quarrying in the Kaimur hills, the state government has decided to lease out three blocks of the hills near Sasaram for mining purpose. 

 Rohtas assistant mining officer Gyanedra Kumar said the mines and geology department has directed the DM to draft the terms and conditions for inviting tenders for the purpose.
 
 “Special secretary (mines and geology) Arun Parkash has in his letter to the DM directed that the vicinity be fenced before issuing mining licences so as to prevent illegal mining,” said an official.
 
 Soon after becoming CM in 2005, Nitish Kumar had decided not to renew the lease of the hills for mining purpose. “The government reviewed its decision and the CM during his visit to the district in December last year gave his consent for leasing out the hills for mining,” the official said.
