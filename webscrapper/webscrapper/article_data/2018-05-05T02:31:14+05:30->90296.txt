Constable Pankaj rushed inside the ATM and overpowered the man, who was later identified as Dumbrava. He had 14 cloned plastic cards with passwords and Rs 48,000 with him.

Mirea was found to be having 34 cloned plastic cards and Rs 1.4 lakh in a black bag. The duo told the police that they used to come to India through Nepal, and procure cloned plastic cards and PIN numbers from their associates. They took rooms in a hotel in Delhi. 
 
 The duo then looked for unmanned ATMs, hid their face with a mask, helmet, cap, goggles etc, and withdrew money using the cloned plastic cards. They converted the money into foreign currency and fled to Nepal.
