PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Residents of eight   in Mulshi taluka have opposed the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA)’s plan to construct a ring  .

 Villagers from Nere, Sangawade, Darumbre, Gahunje, Salumbre, Parandwadi, Godumbre and Dhamane have alleged that the   would affect around 1,000 hectares of land under sugarcane cultivation, rendering hundreds of villagers landless and homeless.
 
 Janardan Paigude, founder president of Vande Mataram Shetkari Vikas Sanghatna, told TOI, “PMRDA will acquire land for the 110-metre wide   road as well as for development of 500-metre land on its both sides. The land affected in Khed, Maval and Mulshi talukas is hilly and blessed with heavy rainfall, forests, wildlife sanctuaries, major and minor dams. The land here is fertile, suitable for growing rice and sugarcane, practice floriculture, dairy and poultry farming, develop nurseries and practice other agricultural activities.”
 
 Paigude said, “The state government implemented many projects like creating industrial areas, IT parks, affecting many villages. The government plans to implement more development projects in these areas, which will destroy the livelihood of the remaining  . If the urbanization and industrialization continues, it will lead to massive increase in population, crime, destruction of environment and other problems.”
 
 Villagers have suggested that the road pass through barren land instead.
 
 “A letter has been sent to CM Devendra Fadnavis opposing the project. These three talukas must be excluded from PMRDA limits. Instead, villages in the eastern parts of the district, which have undeveloped talukas like Baramati, Daund, Indapur and eastern parts of Shirur, must be included. It will be easier to develop these areas as they receive less rainfall,” he said.
