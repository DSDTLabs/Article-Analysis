 The January 10 edition of RAW took place at New Orleans, the same place where The Undertaker's legendary undefeated streak came to an end at the hands of Lesnar during Wrestlemania 30 in 2014. And he didn't forget it. He said that no one would control him and that he goes where he wants, when he wants. "I've dug 29 holes for 29 souls, and after I win, I will return to the main event of Wrestlemania," he said.
 
 Lesnar and Goldberg apart, Taker joins Big E, Kofi Kingston, Xavier Woods, Chris Jericho, Braun Strowman and Baron Corbin on the list on confirmed entrants for the Rumble match. As announced earlier on the show, Seth Rollins too said that he will be entering the 30-man Rumble.
 
 The Royal Rumble returns to the Alamadome for the first time in 20 years and will be Taker's first since 2007. Incidentally, Taker was the only entrant back in 1997 from the current roster to wrestle in the Rumble. He entered No. 13 before being eliminated by Stone Cold Steve Austin.
