Actor   is very excited about his role as   in 'The  ' opposite  . 

 The 40-year-old actor will play   aka Deathstroke opposite Affleck in the title role in the upcoming DC blockbuster, and he couldn't be happier about it as he's always rooted for the villain when watching similar films. 
 
  
  
 "I'm very excited. I just started kung fu, qigong and cutting with a live katana blade. That's been a lot of fun. I grew up rooting for the villain," he says. 
 
 "These characters mean so much to so many people and there's a real opportunity to polarise an audience or have them walk away maybe not agreeing with my character but understanding why he does what he does. That's a really fun challenge."
