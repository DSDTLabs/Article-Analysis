NEW DELHI: In a fresh attack on   for “objecting” to the AAP government’s pilgrimage scheme, chief minister   tweeted on Friday, “I am very, very sad that LG is practically obstructing every scheme and every project of Delhi government. How do we run (the government) like this?” 

 The tweet followed transport minister Kailash Gahlot’s announcement on Twitter, “Now LG objects to (Mukhyamantri) Teerth Yatra Yojana. LG wants it to be restricted to BPL.” The scheme, part of the 2018-19 budget, proposes to take 77,000 senior citizens from Delhi on free pilgrimage every year. 
 
 The LG’s office, however, clarified through a note that the LG had “advised that it would be equitable to have some income criteria to ascertain the eligibility of beneficiaries”. He has also sought clarifications as to why a certificate from the local MLA is necessary regarding an applicant’s residence when voter ID cards have been made mandatory to become a beneficiary.
 
 Partially blaming BJP for it, Kejriwal appealed to the opposition party not to obstruct the government’s work. “My appeal to BJP — Don’t obstruct our work. I challenge your governments in other states to compete with us in work.” 
 
 Underlining the importance of the plan for the non-poor, Gahlot said, “LG forgets that many children do not support their old parents. They would be happy to receive government support. And every government facility should not be restricted only to BPL.” 
 
 However, the note said the LG had said there should be transparent criteria to select the beneficiaries in case the number of applicants exceeds the available slots.
 
 It also said that while returning the file on March 8, the LG had invited Gahlot for a discussion. However, no attempt has been made by the office of the minister so far, the note added.
