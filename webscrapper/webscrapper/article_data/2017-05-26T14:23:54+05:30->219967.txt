DEHRADUN: The state government will identify and relocate two villages in each district that lie in disaster prone areas. The state government plans to start the process after a budget is approved for the same in the forthcoming assembly session in June.
 
  The government has identified 352 villages across Uttarakhand, many of which are in  . In the initial phase of the exercise, the government will relocate two villages in each district that lie in high seismic zones or face threat of floods.
  
  After the 2013 flash floods hit the state, the   government had also proposed relocation of villages but no action was taken.
  
  Secretary, disaster management,  , told  , “A second round of video conferencing was held with the district magistrate on Thursday in this regard. We have asked the DMs to identify two villages each in their respective districts, which are located in disaster prone areas, so they can be shifted first.”
  
  Officials said that the exercise was at an elaborate level. “ It is an extremely difficult task as we have to collect even the minutest of details of each villages, their residents, profession, the compensation to be given to them, whether a person owned a house or was staying on rent and the size of land to be given to them,” said Negi. The finance department staff is, at present, deciding the budget for the relocation process.
  
  The authorities also face challenges in identifying the locations the villages will be shifted to. While in the plain districts of Haridwar, Dehradun and Udham Singh Nagar, the shortage of available land may pose a problem, in the hills, permission from the forest department may be required at some places.
