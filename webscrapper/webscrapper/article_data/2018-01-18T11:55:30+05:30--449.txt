HYDERABAD: The proposal to relocate two hamlets in the core area of   tiger reserve was finalised at a high level meeting presided by chief secretary,  , here on Wednesday.

 Though as many as 23 villages in the heart of Kawal tiger reserve have been proposed for relocation, only two villages will be shifted in the first phase. Other villages will be shifted in phases after holding talks with the residents. Incidentally, people living in these two villages - Rampur and Mysampet - have volunteered to leave their homes and settle down elsewhere. Though originally a tiger habitat, Kawal has gradually lost its big cats for various reasons including increased human interface and poaching. However, in a welcome sign, big cat movement is observed occasionally in the Kawal tiger reserve.
 
  Tiger Conservation Authority ( ), afew years ago, proposed shifting of hamlets from the core area of tiger reserves in a bid to reduce human interface in a hope that the tiger population would increase.
 
 The state government has intensified efforts to convince villagers to move out following sighting of two tigers last month in Nirmal district. Kawal tiger reserve is spread over 350 sq km covering the districts of Adilabad,  , Mancharyal and Nirmal. It is one of the two tiger reserves in Telangana.
 
 Rampur and Mysampet villages together have about 100 families and they all will be shifted to plain areas in   mandal of Asifabad district. Each family will be paid compensation of â‚¹10 lakh. Senior officials, on Wednesday, finalised the compensation and decided to rehabilitate the villagers. NTCA inspector-general (south), PS Somasekhar and other officials were also present.
