Kolkata: State BJP president   dared the state on Saturday to prevent Hindu religious organisations from taking out processions with tridents and swords during   on April 5. Ghosh, an MLA from Kharagpur, announced that he will lead the Ram Navami rally with tridents and swords and is ready to court arrest.

 Speaking at a seminar on atrocities on minorities in Bangladesh at   on Saturday, Ghosh said: “Who are the police to issue permission? In Ram Rajya, people worshipped Ram for centuries. Do we have to take permission for that? It is ludicrous. People in Bengal will worship Ram and this time they will do it with arms. If we are few, only then will the law be used against us.” 
 
 He insisted on the show of strength for the security of Hindus across the border. “A showdown of the Hindus here will help protect the temples being vandalised in Bangladesh.” 
 
 Ghosh made no bones about playing the Hindu card. “Those feeling uneasy with it are free to leave India. Nothing will matter if two to four crore people cross over. You are welcome to move out of India,” Ghosh said.
 
 Ghosh’s assertion got sanction from   Governor  . “Hindu consciousness in Bengal is a guarantee for protection of minorities across the border. Bengalis need to put pressure on the Centre on this issue. But I find that Bengalis are least bothered about their brothers across the border,” he said.
