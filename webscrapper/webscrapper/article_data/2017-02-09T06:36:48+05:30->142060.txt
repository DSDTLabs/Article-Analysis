NAGPUR: “Every 19 seconds, a female dies of breast cancer. Therefore,   should take precaution to prevent this most common disease,” said Dr Varsha Taori. She was delivering a lecture on breast   awareness at Shri Ramdeobaba College of Engineering and Management on Wednesday. 

 Professor   arranged the lecture-cum-interactive session which was organized by  .
 
 With an experience of 15 years in gynaecology, Dr Taori explained how a woman’s body transforms at every stage of life, from puberty to menopause. A female should know if these changes are normal. She urged the women to take care of themselves and immediately consult a doctor if they find anything unusual. 
 
 Breast cancer is where cells in the tissue divide and grow without normal control. Revealing the causes of breast cancer, Dr Taori said, “It can be genetically inherited. Women with close relatives who have been diagnosed with   have a high risk of suffering from the disease. Therefore, one should know their family history and be alert.” Being overweight or obese after menopause, consuming alcohol, little or no breast feeding are among the factors leading to breast cancer, she added.
 
 Self-examination is mandatory, said Dr Taori. Every female should check formation of lumps in her breasts and get mammography test done. Tumours detected are often benign (non-cancerous). They can be simple cysts, fibro adenomas, intraductal papillomas and traumatic fat necrosis. There are various treatment options available, Dr Taori said. “Mastectomy (removal of breasts), lumpectomy (removal of lumps), radiation and chemotherapy can be done to cure the disease,” she added
 
 She also threw light on the second most common cancer for women, i.e. cervical cancer. She said, “Vaccinations can be taken to protect against it and every female must go for it.” She discussed problems of women who came up with queries and guided them.
