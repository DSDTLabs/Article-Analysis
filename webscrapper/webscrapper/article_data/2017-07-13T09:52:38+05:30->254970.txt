MOHALI:   became streams and   ponds in just a few hours of first   showers in the city on Wednesday. The lack of preparedness of the municipal corporation was exposed.

 It is a decades old problem, always allowed to reoccur, as the   administration sleeps over choked road gullies and blocked sewers. The blockage flooded low-lying areas with ankle-deep water. Most of the city parks came in the affected zone. It included the Mango Park in Industrial Area Phase 3, green belt in Phase V, Community Park in Phase XI, and the parking lot opposite the GMADA (Greater Mohali Area Development Authority) office.
 
 The municipal corporation as well as GMADA claimed they had done their duty of clearing the blockage, but the public saw no improvement. The MC was accused of not paying heed to the civic problems. Shamsher Singh of Phase VI said: “It has been ages since we had smooth drive on the roads outside our houses. Rain has left us with more potholes, which are hard to pick under stranded water. The conditions for two-wheeler riders especially are dangerous. The civic body is least bothered to repair the roads or clear the road gullies.”
 
 The weather department has confirmed the   of monsoonand predicted heavy rain over a short interval in the next three days. The civic body will have not enough time to clear the blockage. Big logjams were the morning scene at key crossings. The breakdown of vehicles on waterlogged streets prolonged the situation. Police had to clear the stranded vehicles from the middle of the road.
