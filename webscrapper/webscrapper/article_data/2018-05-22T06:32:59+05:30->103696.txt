MUMBAI: Parents ought to steer away from a presumption that   are meant to be babysitters, a   has said, adding grandchildren should not become their burden in old age.

 
 “It is the duty of the parents and not grandparents to take care of their children. Grandparents may be there to support, guide and assist in raising the children. However, they should not be burdened to babysit grandchildren as their primary duty, by compromising their relaxation, entertainment and travel plan,” said a   while passing orders on a woman’s plea for maintenance. It said the woman’s tone in holding her in-laws responsible for having to place her kids in a crèche, was ‘absolutely wrong’. “Grandparents cannot be blamed, if a child needs to be placed in a crèche,’’ said the court.
