Bengaluru: Home minister Ramalinga Reddy has termed BJP leaders   Karandlaje, Anantkumar  , C T Ravi and Nalin Kumar Kateel black spots in Karnataka politics and accused them of lowering the level of political discourse by making cheap remarks against their opponents.

 “These leaders have no decency. Shobha gives a call for people to beat the CM with sticks. C T Ravi and Hegde call the state government a mass murderer and butcher. How can people in public life use such words against their opponents? BJP leaders have no culture and they are unfit to be in politics. They will stoop to any level for power,’’ Reddy alleged. 
 
 He was responding to the BJP leaders’ remarks against the government and Congress leaders during their Jana Suraksha Yatra which concluded in Mangaluru on Tuesday. “I can also give them a befitting reply in that language, but I won’t do that,” he added.
 
 Taking objection to the BJP’s accusation that law and order situation in Karnataka has taken a beating, Reddy claimed the state has become much more safer under the Congress rule than in 2008-2013. “When the BJP was in power, the state had registered 8,885 murders and the number has come down to 7,759 now . The number of robbery cases have dipped by 90 and assault cases by 13,000 during the Congress regime,’’ he claimed.
 
 On the allegation that 24 Hindu activists have been killed in the state, Reddy said only 10 murders have connection with communal clashes and the rest were due to personal rivalry, suicide and other reasons. “The accused in 14 cases are Hindus and the government has nothing to do with these murders,” he said. 
 
 He said the Congress will release a chargesheet against the BJP highlighting its misdeeds when it was power in the state and the BBMP.
