GHAZIABAD: A 40-year-old man was sentenced to life imprisonment for killing his nephew over a property dispute five years back in   area. The accused was also found guilty of seriously injuring his sister and brother-in-law. The judge also imposed a fine of Rs 30,000 on the convict with an instruction to give half of the money to the victim’s family as a compensation.

 On August 11, 2013, Jitendra alias Johny had attacked his sister Praveen Kaur, her husband   and their son Rana Jasdev Singh with a knife.
 
 While Praveen and Devendra received injuries in the attack, Jasdev had later succumbed to his injuries. Additional district government counsel Meena Sharma said, “Jitendra was an alcoholic and wanted to grab a piece of land belonging to his mother. However, he needed the signature of his sister for this purpose. His main aim was to sell this land. Praveen was resisting Jitendra’s demand, and this had further infuriated him.”
 
 According to Sharma, Jitendra went to Praveen’s house on that fateful day and attacked the family members. 
 
 Jasdev, who was in his early 20s, suffered fatal injuries and died. On the complaint of his father, an FIR was lodged,” Sharma added. 
 
 The case was heard by additional district judge (No. 8)   who sentenced him to life imprisonment. Altogether, 10 witnesses had recorded their statement.
