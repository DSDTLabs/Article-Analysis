MADURAI: The city corporation is planning to monitor the Pandalkudi drainage channel through closed circuit television camera system (CCTV). Corporation commissioner Aneesh   ordered officials to install   cameras as residents complained that motorists, who pass through the area, dump garbage into the channel.

 Sekhar decided to visit the channel after a resident brought the issue to his knowledge through corporationâ€™s WhatsApp complaint number. Garbage was found dumped on both sides of the channel which runs through various places in the city including   and Meenambalpuram.
 
 The civic workers were deployed to clear the accumulated garbage that posed health risk for the residents. Apart from household wastes including plastic bags, there was also construction debris dumped in the channel.
 
 A corporation official said that although they have been clearing the channels periodically, the lack of cooperation from residents result in clogging of channels. The officials urged them to clear the garbage accumulated in the house only through sanitation employees, who come for door-to-door collection.
 
 Sekhar warned the residents against dumping waste into the channel and said that those not adhering would be fined. 
 
 The residents, however, said that waste is mostly dumped by commuters who carry garbage bags and dump it into the channel on the way. The corporation commissioner then ordered the installation of CCTV cameras to monitor the area. 
 
 Sekhar also levied Rs 4,000 fine on two people. A fine of Rs 2,000 was collected from a man for having used the channel to raise his ponies. While another person, who was found littering near the channel, was fined with Rs 2,000.
