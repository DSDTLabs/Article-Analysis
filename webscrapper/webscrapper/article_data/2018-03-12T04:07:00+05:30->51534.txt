Vadodara: For the first time, Barodians will be able to view works of eminent veteran artist Jyoti Bhatt which were never exhibited here. 

 Interestingly, the exhibition which will be open to public from Sunday, will be the third solo show of Bhatt in city in 68 years of his lifetime which he has spent in the cultural capital of the state.
 
 In the 140 works which will be displayed, Bhatt has tried to amalgamate Indian mythology, cubist forms and even pop art in the forms of paintings, graphic prints, reincarnations of the same along with photographs and digitally created artworks. The collection also includes one of Bhatt’s first works and his latest work and also those that were destroyed or lost due to various reasons.
 
 In the 15 reincarnated works, art enthusiasts can witness the drastic evolution of Bhatt as an artist. “It is often found that we want to stick to our roots and do not evolve. We do not want to touch technology, but I have tried digital,” said Bhatt, who has been open to technology. “I have tried to revive some of my old works that were created with material which was affordable and easily available to me during the early years of my career,” he added.
 
 Though the collection that will be exhibited at Gorwa-based Ark art gallery, will include graphic prints and photogrpahs, Bhatt accepts that there is a hierarchical classification in the art world like the caste system.
 
 “A photograph is considered inferior than a graphic print and the print in turn is inferior that a painting by not only art dealers but galleries and public as well. But the collectors should understand that longevity is equally important and technology helps us in that because with advancement in technology it has now become possible to revive, renovate and reproduce old works of art that are not in good condition,” said Bhatt.
