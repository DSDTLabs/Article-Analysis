Chennai:  , senior advocate and wife of former union minister P Chidambaram, has appealed against a single judge order refusing to dispense with her personal appearance before   ( ) in connection with the Kolkata-based Saradha Chit Fund  .

 A vacation bench of Justice V Bharathidasan and Justice N Seshasayee initially said they were not inclined to hear the appeal, but later agreed to hear the matter on Friday, if time permitted. 
 
 The issue pertains to summons issued by the ED directing Nalini’s appearance in person as a witness in the chit fund scam. Aggrieved by the summons, she moved the high court saying as per Section 160, women and children could not be summoned outside their place of residence for any inquiry.
 
 However, a single judge dismissed her plea and saying Nalini could not seek absolute exemption from personal appearance in the investigation process citing the general provisions of Section 160. “The court expects that senior advocates like the petitioner do not shy away from cooperating in the investigation of offences committed under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,” the single judge said.
 
 On April 30, as directed by the court, ED issued a fresh summon directing her appearance in their Kolkata office on May 7.
 
 Noting that the single judge has discussed the applicability of section 160 in his order, the bench observed that when such appearance is mandated by PMLA, then the petitioner must appear.
