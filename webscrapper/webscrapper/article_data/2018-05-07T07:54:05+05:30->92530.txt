MADHEPURA: The two national highways—NH-106 (Birpur to  ) and NH-107 (Maheshkut to  ) crossing through the district are in a deplorable condition with   dotting the highways and making travel along the stretches a nightmare for commuters.

 The 145 km long NH-107 which runs from Maheshkut to Purnia, is also the lifeline of Madhepura.“It is extremely difficult to navigate through the numerous potholes which dominate the entire stretch from   to   with some of the potholes big enough to overturn heavy loaded trucks,” says a regular commuter on the stretch Sanjay Pati.
 
 While the widening and double-laning work of NH-106 which began in 2017, is moving at a snail’s pace and is the potholes are yet to be filled. In fact, both the highways are busy with heavy and light vehicles using the stretch. Even a light rain causes waterlogging. “The rain has further battered the road and the craters are so big that negotiating them is tough and we always fear of the vehicle turning turtle,” said another commuter Tridev Mishra.
 
 A frequent commuter   said, “It takes at least two hours to cross a distance of 20 km on both the NHs. It’s a nightmare to use this stretch as there is every chance of falling into potholes filled with rainwater.” 
 
 According to sources, Gammon India Limited has been assigned the task for repairing NH- 107. Sources, however claimed that the firm is yet to get a formal work assignment. The reason being attributed for the delay was getting a nod from the forest and environment department.
 
 Madhepura DM Md Sohail said work will commence soon. “I have communicated the matter to the state in charge of National Highways Authority of India ( ) with a request to start the work immediately,” said the DM.
