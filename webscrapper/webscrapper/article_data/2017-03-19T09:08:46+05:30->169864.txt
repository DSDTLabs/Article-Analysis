HYDERABAD: Mild tension prevailed in the Saidabad area on Saturday after school authorities during an SSC examination allegedly asked girls to remove their hijab for identification before entering the examination hall. Agitated parents gathered near   (SVV) school at Dhobighat in Saidabad and questioned the move. 

 Police posted near the examination centre had to intervene after parents tried to enter the school premises. They were, however, stopped and asked to leave, citing the police commissioner's prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CRPC. The order prohibits assembling of persons 500 yards from all SSC public exam centres from March 14 to 30. 
 
 "There are clear instructions from the district education officer (DEO) Hyderabad that girls cannot be forced to remove their burqa. Authorities flouted the directions by the education department," said   of Majlis Basho Tehreek (MBT), who, along with members of MBT, joined parents in their protest. He later lodged a complaint with Saidabad police . 
 
 When contacted, Virender Babu, correspondent of  , refuted the allegations. He said: "The school building has been handed over to the education department for exams. Only women teachers are checking girl candidates and allegations of parents are false." 
 
 District education officer of Hyderabad G Ramesh said, "In the Saidabad incident, authorities enquired if the students could remove their veil for checking. Later, they were allowed to enter the in time and write their exam," he said. The DEO, however, clarified that there is no such rule which disallows students from entering the examination centre wearing a veil.
