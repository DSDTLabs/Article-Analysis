SASARAM/PATNA: Rohtas DM A K Parasar on Thursday issued a   to the district education officer (DEO) for trying to coerce school children into joining the human chain to be formed on January 21.
 
  The proposed 11,000km human chain, organised by the state government, is aimed at spreading awareness against intoxicants. The state government has said that participation in the event is voluntary.
  
  However, the DEO has issued a letter warning schoolchildren that their enrolment with schools will become invalid if they skip the event. Addressed to the headmasters of primary, middle, secondary and senior secondary schools of the government in the district, the letter has sought participation of even primary students in the chain and said those abstaining from it will be deprived of government benefits.
  
  As the letter made its way to the social media, the DM issued the notice, asking the DEO why he issued such an order when there was no government directive to the effect.
  
  When contacted, Rohtas DEO Ashok Kumar Singh said he was on leave on Tuesday when the letter was issued by district project officer (DPO) Awadesh Singh, in his capacity as the acting DEO.
  
  The DPO explained the letter was meant to increase awareness about prohibition. “But I have verbally asked the schools not to bring students of classes up to IV,” he said.
  
  Meanwhile, Patna DEO Meghu Das told TOI in Patna on Thursday that primary students of Patna district would not be involved in the event.
