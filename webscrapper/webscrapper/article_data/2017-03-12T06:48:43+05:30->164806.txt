NAGPUR: Former Maharashtra advocate general   on Friday said that the system which contributes to the uplift of society should belong to its own people and that’s why Vidarbha should have its own government.

 Aney was speaking on ‘Potential of Vidarbha’, organized by   of Nagpur, at   Hall of Kurvey’s New Modal School. He said, “Vidarbha produces over 70% of electricity and minerals that Maharashtra has. It also produces 70% cotton and has 80% irrigation. Therefore, Vidarbha can survive on its own, without any help from Maharashtra.”
 
 “The capital of our country is controlled by Mumbai. It has 40% wealth of the entire country which can only be controlled through Vidarbha. Therefore, various political parties promised a separate Vidarbha, but never delivered it,” Aney added. “Deciding minimum selling price for farmers and offering subsidy in agriculture are the only ways to empower them. This will reduce the number of farmers’ suicides in Vidarbha,” he said.
 
 “ Discussing the role of the government, Aney said that even for a developed Vidarbha, it needs projects that should be executed and should not just remain on papers. “Even though we get promises of government jobs, we only get 2.5% in Vidarbha. More than 50.8% jobs are created in Pune. There are not even proper hospitals in Chandrapur,” he said. 
 
 Dr KS Rajan and  , secretary, Rotary Club Downtown, were present at the programme. Varsha Deshpande made the introductory remarks. Virendra Patrikar, president of Rotary Club, conducted the programme while Chetan Khanorkar proposed a vote of thanks.
