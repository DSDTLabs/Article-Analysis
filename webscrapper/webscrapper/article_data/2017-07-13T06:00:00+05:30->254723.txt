When she went to bed on Sunday night, little did actress   know that she would wake up to reports that claim she attempted suicide due to trouble in her marriage with  . “That’s exactly how it has panned out and it’s been a nightmare.... I am fed up of explaining to people that everything is okay between Varun and me. Why, we are even making plans to celebrate our first wedding anniversary in Paris this August. I’ve a girls’ trip to   coming up... Life’s rocking! Why would I think of taking my life?” rattles off   in one breath. 
So what’s with the suicide story? “It’s all rubbish, that’s what! I recently got back from the US and since then, I have been terribly jetlagged. I am sleepless in the night and drowsy all day. This has been going on for so long, that I sought my doctor’s opinion. She prescribed some sleeping pills to help me regulate my sleep cycle,” says Vithika. Admitting that it was careless of her to not follow the reccomended dosage, she adds, “On Sunday, I popped two tablets first around 9.30 pm but I still couldn’t sleep. After some time, I popped two more thinking it might work. Before nodding off, I had called Sandesh (who’s shooting in the US) and my mother and told them I am feeling sleepy finally.” 
 “My mother called me on Monday; when I didn’t answer, she panicked and came home to find me asleep. Next thing I know is that I woke up in the hospital, with doctors chiding me for being so careless. I was in the hospital for a and had a stomach wash. I was discharged on Tuesday morning.”
 So how did pictures of her in hospital surface on social media? “Well, I had shared few of those pictures to my close friends in the US; from there it got leaked to some Tollywood folks here and the next thing I see, it’s all over social media with outrgeous stories of trouble in my marriage,” she says, adding, “It’s ridiculous — the stories claim I am dying, while I am actually in the spa right now, prepping for my girlfriend getaway.” Good for you, girl!
