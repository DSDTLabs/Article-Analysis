JAISALMER: Jaisalmer collector   has been under fire for not doing enough for the dalit minor   he had adopted a year back. According to reports, Meena had announced during a night chaupal in Mandai village on July 1 last year that he would take care of all expenses of six-year-old Deepika who lost her father four years ago and whose mother later on married someone else. 

 But the girl has got just dresses on a couple of occasions from the collector and no economic assistance or benefit of any government scheme. 
 
 District collector   accepted that due to some technical reasons, the bank account of the adopted girl could not be opened and in next 3-4 days, the girl will get all the benefits. She has been selected in Palanhar Yojana. 
 
 Girl’s grandfather Tamal Ram and grandmother are raising her, but due to poor financial condition, they are unable to take care of the child and themselves. 
 
 Meena also said that a sum of Rs 3 lakh has been approved from   fund to build a water tank and a toilet near the girl’s house and directions have been given to BDO in this regard.
