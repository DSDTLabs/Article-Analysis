Keri: Residents of Ghoteli No 2 in Keri celebrated a cracker-free Navratri this year. The Sarvajanik Navdurga Utsav Mandal decided to break away from the traditional practice of lighting fireworks and crackers everyday during the nine-day long celebration. “This year, we decided not to light crackers and fireworks, and thus, not contribute to noise and air pollution. All members of the mandal, along with devotees, strictly followed the rule,” said Laxman Pandurang Gawas, member of Keri village panchayat from Ghoteli No. 2. “For the last seven years, we have been lighting fireworks on each day of the festivities. This year, however, we decided to use the funds to award education scholarships and do other humanitarian works,” said treasurer Nanda Mahadev Gawas. The positive change came about after committee members pledged not to light crackers and fireworks at the insistence of Ramdas Shetkar and Vithal Shelke of Vivekanand Environment Awareness Brigade (VEAB). “We launched the anti-firework campaign during Ganesh chaturthi and received good response. We met members of various organising committees and requested them no to light fireworks,” said Shetkar.
