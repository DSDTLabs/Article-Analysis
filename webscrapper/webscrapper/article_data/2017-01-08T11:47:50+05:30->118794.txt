THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a move without precedence anywhere in India, IAS officers in Kerala are planning to go on mass   on Monday to protest against the alleged vindictive attitude and abuse of power by vigilance director  , and the tacit support he has been reportedly provided by powers-that-be in the  .

 The IAS association that met here on Saturday also decided to take up the matter with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. 
 
 Discontent had been brewing among the IAS fraternity for the last few months regarding the way the vigilance department has been targeting them, and it erupted with the latest incident in which additional chief secretary (industries) Paul Antony was arraigned as third accused in the vigilance probe against CPM leader and former industries minister E P Jayarajan.
 
 The IAS association meeting expressed strong dissatisfaction over the manner in which the government is shielding the vigilance director, against whom several allegations, including encroachment of forest land in Madikeri in Karnataka, have been levelled.
 
 The resolution passed by IAS officers also cited violation of all-India service conduct rules by Thomas when he took up private employment at TKM College in Kollam, and causing a loss of Rs 50 cr to the exchequer by disregarding norms in purchases during his tenure as director of ports.
 
 “Ironically, the government has not even called for the explanation of the vigilance director so far to prove the sources of financing for these assets, while he himself is allowed to charge cases of disproportionate assets in gross abuse of power. We are deeply aggrieved and saddened that such an officer whose integrity is prima facie doubtful and not beyond suspicion, is allowed to sit in judgment as vigilance director on the conduct of other civil servants,” the resolution said.
 
 The resolution also fully backs Antony. “We have reason to believe that the action by the vigilance director against our senior colleague was motivated by vindictive retaliation, primarily due to the fact that he took the view that the arrest of K Padmakumar, former managing director, Malabar Cements Limited, was in gross violation of all legal norms and principles of natural justice,” it said.
