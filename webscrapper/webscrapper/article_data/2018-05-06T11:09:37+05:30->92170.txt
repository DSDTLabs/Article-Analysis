CHENNAI: It seemed to be a test not only for students but for their families too, as NEET   tried to comply with the  's rules and dress code on Sunday. 

 Jewellery, belts, shoes, clips were all removed, sacred threads on hands cut and handkerchiefs ware taken away even if it meant runny noses for students. 
 
 Most girls who wore ponytails had to remove the rubber bands and leave their hair loose as they went inside the exam centres here. 
 
 Several students came out of exam halls as   had forgotten to sign on the hall tickets. Many schools had photographers inside for students who had failed to bring a passport size photo with their admit cards. 
 
 There were reports of some students coming to the exam centres late. They were not allowed to appear for the test. 
 
 Scores of parents lined up outside centres and spread out on pavements and apartment entrances after their wards went into the centres to appear for the test that will determine their entry into medical colleges across the country.
 
 The exam that began at 10am will be over at 1pm.
