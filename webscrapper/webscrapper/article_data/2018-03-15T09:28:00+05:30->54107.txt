HYDERABAD: The presence of toxic pollutants in the air is shooting up at an alarming rate with the latest data indicating that the particulate matter (PM) 2.5 levels have stood beyond the permissible limits for 10 out of the 13 monitoring stations of the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) located in and around the city.

 PM 2.5 levels stand highest at the Sanatnagar (99 g/ m3) monitoring station, followed closely by   (96 g/ m3) and Pashamylaram (91g/ m3).
 
 PM 10 levels have, meanwhile, skyrocketed with all 23 monitoring stations reporting levels much beyond the set environmental standards (60). This level stands highest at Zoo Park (182), Charminar (165), Pashamylaram (162), ICRISAT (161), Kukatpally (160) and   (159).
 
 PM 10 levels are also hovering at higher levels in other locations in the city such as Jeedimetla (149), Bolarum (149),   (147) and Abids (141).
 
 “PM 2.5 is particulate matter in the air that is finer and hence has more potential to enter one’s respiratory tract than PM 10. There are shortterm as well as long-term health effects caused by exposure to air pollutants. While short-term effects include breathing difficulties, the long-term effects can include wheezing and asthma,” said Dr  , a city-based pulmonologist.
 
 The level of other pollutants in the air such as sulphur dioxide (SO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) too have gone up, shows data provided by the TSPCB.
 
 While the normally recorded 24-hour average of SO2 stands at 4.4 ug/m3, the SO2 content at Sanathnagar and ICRISAT stood alarmingly high at above 17 ug/m3 in 2018.
 
 The pollution levels in areas such as Sanathnagar and Zoo Park are, in fact, worse than those observed in industrial areas in the city.
 
 Air pollution levels in the Zoo Park are now dangerously high, according to figures available with the TSPCB. In spite of being classified as a ‘sensitive’ zone with a permissible Air Quality Index under 100, the Zoo Park has recorded an AQI of 217 in 2018.
