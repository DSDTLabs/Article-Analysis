NEW DELHI: If for nothing else,   Ravindra Gaikwad ought to get full marks for tenacity. Yes, he again booked tickets on   (AI), and, yes, the airline again blocked him, agencies reported today.

 Gaikwad's 
  yesterday for the March 23 incident - when he assaulted an AI crew member - didn't wash with AI or any other airline and the ban on his travel on all domestic airlines continues. AI hasn't received any communication either from the aviation ministry to lift the flying ban on Gaikwad, airline sources told ANI.
 
 News agencies reported that Gaikwad booked two tickets again - one Delhi-Mumbai and one Mumbai-Delhi - which AI promptly rejected.
 
  
  
 
 "Ravindra Gaikwad poses a threat to flight safety, (we) won't fly him until he gives (an) unconditional apology," said the 
  , today.
 
 It will be a "shame" if Gaikwad is allowed to resume flying "without a rap on the knuckles" for his act of beating up a 60-year-old staffer and threatening to throw him off a plane at   last month, AI said yesterday, after Gaikwad's apology.
 
 "Appreciate stand taken against unruly passengers, pledge unconditional support to you," said the   today.
 
 Gaikwad reportedly tried to book tickets surreptitiously twice before as well, when domestic airlines banned him. He was caught out both times and denied tickets and had to travel by train to Delhi from Pune to attend Parliament.
