Television actress   is expanding horizons, this time beyond   television. She’s bagged a negative role in the Telugu period drama  . The first 10 episodes of this TV show is being helmed by   director S S Rajamouli.
An ecstatic Meghana Gowda says, “I have acted in three serials in Telugu, before getting to play Soudhamini — my character in Swarna Khadgam, which has negative shades. This character can be compared to Bhallala Deva’s character in Baahubali. I had to learn horse riding and followed strict workout sessions to get into shape. There were acting workshops too, to help me get under the skin of the character. The budget of the serial, which is touted to be the highest in the history of South Indian television, will be a visual treat. The serial is being dubbed in 14 languages.”
 Meghana, who has also acted in Malayalam and Tamil serials, adds that there is not much difference when it comes to working in various languages. About her journey as an actress on television, she says, “I was working in a private company after I finished my graduation. I also worked as a part-time model during those days. It was director   who spotted the talent in me and offered me a role in  .” 
 While she is also shooting for yet another Kannada show — Avalu, Meghana had had her share of tryst with films too — with roles in films like 3 Ghante 30 Dina 30 Second. She will also be seen in the Ganesh-starrer — Orange.
