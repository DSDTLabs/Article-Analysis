HYDERABAD: The ad hoc chairman of the city chapter of Anna Hazare-led   (IAC) is under fire for speaking against an   constructed by his own housing society. S Chandrasekhar, 63, was sacked from the primary membership of the Prashanthinagar welfare association (PWA), Uppal, on Tuesday.

 Chandrasekhar was expelled for seven years in an order signed by PWA secretary B Sadashiva Rao following an executive meeting convened by the association on Tuesday.
 
 The trigger for the decision was Chandrasekhar’s complaint against PWA before the GHMC Uppal deputy commissioner,  , for illegal construction of a community centre. This prompted the authorities to slap a property tax notice of Rs 3,02,291 on Jan 23, 2017 (A copy is with TOI).
 
 “The community centre was constructed between 2005 and 2014 with money raised from more than 200 PWA members. But when I started enquiring, I learnt that it had no permission from the GHMC,” said S Chandrashekhar, founder of the Anti-Corruption Enforcement Forum. Explaining why he took on his own housing society, he said, “The fight is between legal and illegal acts. I will do this irrespective of any affinity with any associate.”
 
 “We slapped a property tax notice on the community centre for Rs 3,02,291 for 2016 after we found that it was constructed illegally. The PWA will have to pay this tax every year till the building is regularised,” K J Vijaya Krishna told TOI. 
 
 However, S Ramalinga Reddy, president of PWA, defended their decision claiming that Chandrasekhar acted against the interests of the society. “Under the guise of anti-corruption enforcement forum, Chandrasekar is not only working against the interests of residents of colony but also severely damaging the reputation of PWA,” their memo read.
