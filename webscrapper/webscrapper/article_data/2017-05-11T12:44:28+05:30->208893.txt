 star   has received laurels for his hard work and dedication. Tollywood filmmaker   recently spoke about the workaholic nature of the actor.

 He shared that after the success of the duo’s first venture, ‘Run Raja Run,’ Prabhas had asked the director to come with a good script for his next movie. But, thinking that it was just a joke, Sujeeth didn’t take it seriously. After a few months, the actor again enquired about the script and scolded Sujeeth for not completing it.
