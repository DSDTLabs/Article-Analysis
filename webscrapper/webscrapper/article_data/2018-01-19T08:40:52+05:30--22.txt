AHMEDABAD: A furious   on Thursday slammed the   and AMC for  , particularly on crossroads. “There is   at every crossroads in all cities. The presence of traffic cops on crossroads hardly makes any difference to solve the problem,” the court fumed.

 The court said that due to haphazard parking, roads with twothree lanes too turns into single-lane roads. The court suggested that no-parking zones should be declared on roads so that traffic remains smooth. The state government told the court that it would rope in concerned departments to solve traffic problems.
 
 The court also lambasted the AMC for not repairing bad roads in time and outrightly rejected its report on road repairs terming it as “all lies”.
 
 During the hearing of PILs on poor road conditions post 2017 monsoon, a bench of Justice MR Shah and Justice Biren Vaishnav said that whatever stated in the report reveals that there is either no progress or little progress in road repairs. It said that it may form a nodal agency or committee to study the condition of the roads and appoint an official from the   as a nodal officer. The judges said that FSL reports on damaged roads indicate possibility of a scam.
 
 The court was furious with the civic body for not taking HC orders seriously. “You are whiling away time and become serious only when there is a court hearing. Have we not accommodated you enough?” the court told the senior counsel representing AMC. The HC has asked the municipal commissioner to submit a zone wise report on road conditions.
