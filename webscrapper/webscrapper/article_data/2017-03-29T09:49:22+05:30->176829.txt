BENGALURU: For   employees, Ugadi came a day early – the Karnataka government on Monday announced that   would be extended from 58 years to 60. After dilly-dallying on the date of implementation, the government issued a formal   late on Monday, after it was vetted by chief minister   and labour minister  .

 The government, reportedly under pressure from trade unions, brought the revised retirement age into effect from March 27 to ensure that employees slated to retire at the end of the month reap the benefits. More than 33 lakh employees in the state are likely to benefit from the move, which exempts IT-BT companies and firms that have fewer than 50 employees.
 
 The government had initially planned to bring the decision into force on May 1, International Labour Day.
 
 “Our government has been dreaming for long of doing something that will improve the life of private sector employees. I am happy that we managed to accomplish that before Ugadi,” said Lad, the architect of the policy.
 
 The prospect of a few private firms challenging the legality of the decision doesn’t appear to be troubling the government. “The notification has received the governor’s approval, and is now law. Challenging it will not yield results,” said Sanjiv Kumar, additional chief secretary, labour department.
 
 The new rule will be binding on all companies covered under the purview of the Karnataka Factories Act, 1948, and the Karnataka Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1961.
 
 Pointing out that the revised retirement age had been incorporated into the labour act, Kumar added, “The companies cannot ignore the rule. The department will initiate legal action if they do not fall in line. Moreover, the employees too will have the option of moving court and seeking suitable action if the firms force them to retire at 58.”
