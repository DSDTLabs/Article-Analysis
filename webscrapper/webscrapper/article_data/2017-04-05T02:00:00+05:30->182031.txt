PATNA: The evaluation work of Bihar School Examination Board’s (BSEB) Class XII answer books is progressing at a snail’s pace due to the poor turnout of examiners at most of the centres across the state. Even after a lapse of 20 days, only 30% of the total answer sheets of arts, science and commerce streams have been evaluated.

 However, B D College examination controller Binay Kumar Sinha on Tuesday said, “Of the 1.8 lakh answer books stored at our college, nearly 70% have been evaluated. Papers of major subjects like psychology, political science, home science, sociology and geography have been checked, but the evaluation of English and Hindi answer books takes time as they are compulsory subjects.”
 
 According to Baldeva High School’s evaluation director Usha Kumari, teachers of affiliated colleges want similar service conditions like those of teachers of constituent colleges. “At least 17,000 answer books of the arts stream have been checked so far at our centre. The demand of teachers of affiliated colleges for pay parity has adversely affected the evaluation work,” she said, adding the Inter results were likely to be delayed. 
 
 The situation at other evaluation centres in the state capital is more or less the same.
 
 The BSEB has set up 73 centres in the state to carry out evaluation of the Intermediate answer books and made elaborate arrangements to conduct the work smoothly. Of these, eight centres — A N College, B D College, College of Commerce, J D Women’s College, Government Girls’ School, Patna High School, B N Collegiate and Baldeva High School — are located in Patna.
 
 According to BSEB secretary Anup Kumar Sinha, the last date for completion of evaluation work has been extended from March 31 to April 9
