NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over blue and green patches on the  , the   on Wednesday slammed the   ( ) for 'failure' to protect it from rising pollution and even wondered whether the body should be relieved of the task to manage the affairs of the world heritage site. 

 
 A bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta said ASI was not properly discharging its duty in maintaining the beauty of Taj Mahal and asked the Centre to consider whether some other agency be given the responsibility to protect and preserve the 17th century world heritage site.
 
  Advocate A D N Rao, appearing for ASI, told the bench that it was doing whatever is required to protect the monument. He said the patches on Taj were because of insect-breeding in the stagnated water on Yamuna river bed. 
 
 The court, however, slammed ASI for not accepting the environmental threat to the Taj, saying it was not doing enough to save the monument.
 
  Rao told the bench, "I am not saying that there is no problem but we are trying our best." Not convinced with his submission, the bench told the Centre, "You need to take ASI away from Taj. It is not discharging its duty." The bench pointed out that order passed by the apex court in 1996 had not been complied with in the last 22 years and number of industrial units, which were to be shut down, had increased since then. 
 
 Additional solicitor general  , appearing for the UP government, said the state is committed to protect the monument and all necessary steps would be taken. ASG ANS Nadkarni, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that the government is also considering the SC's suggestion to appoint international experts to recommend measures for protection and preservation of Taj Mahal. 
 
 Advocate M C Mehta, who had been fighting a legal battle for the last 30 years for preserving the monument, said the Centre and state had not followed the court's various orders, resulting in damage to the heritage site.
