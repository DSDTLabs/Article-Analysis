NEW DELHI: The Centre spends three paise per person per day on sports. This was revealed by the sports ministry in   during a discussion on a career in sports. However, this investment per sportsperson goes up when one adds funds provided by the state government as sports is a state subject. 

 Admitting that the ministry of youth affairs and sports spends three paise per capita per day, sports minister Rajyavardhan   said that the total outlay of the department of sports under the ministry during the year 2017-18 was Rs 1,393.21 crore. 
 
 “As per figures of the Census 2011, the population of India is 121 crore. Thus, per capita per day spend of the outlay of the department of sports of this ministry alone is around 3 paise,” he said. 
 
 “Apart from the central and state governments, many non-governmental organisations are also involved in development of sports in the country... Therefore, the actual per capita per day spend of India on sports is certainly higher than 3 paise at present,” added Rathore, who also cited the involvement of corporates in promoting sports through   (corporate social responsibilities) activities.
