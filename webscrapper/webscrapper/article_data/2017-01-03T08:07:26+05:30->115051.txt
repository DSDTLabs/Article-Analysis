 In Jharkhand, only Bokaro and a few other small stations of the district come under this division. The remaining fall under West Bengal. 
 
 Keeping in mind the necessities of passengers, the division has decided to develop the platform and circulating areas of stations like Tupkadih, Radhagaon, Pundag and Ispat Nagar. Very few passenger trains running on this route halt at these stoppages.
 
 For example, no long-route trains stop at Ispat Nagar station, close to Bokaro Steel Township. Bokaro railway station is located away from the city and it has been a long pending demand of the residents to develop the station for regular use.
 
 Railway officials said they are preparing a detailed project report on the same. Senior divisional commercial manager of Adra Railway Division, Bhaskar said that they have planned to develop Ispat Nagar Station and the division has already taken steps to ensure movement of passenger trains on this 
 route. 
 
 "The work to renew the railway tracks is underway and once it is completed, we will introduce passenger trains on this route for the benefit of residents," Bhaskar said.
 
 According to railway authorities, the development of small stations will benefit local passengers. "The division intends to build concrete platforms, parking lots, dustbins and provide other facilities, apart from maintaining cleanliness at these stations. Development of circulating areas will also make these stations beautiful," he added.
 
 Once these small stations are developed, it will take the load off the Bokaro railway stations.
