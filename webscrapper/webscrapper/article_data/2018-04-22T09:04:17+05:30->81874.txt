PUNE:   is rediscovering his appetite for playing big, impactful knocks. After two lacklustre seasons in the  , the 36-year-old Australian, who quit international cricket two years ago, announced a return to his belligerent best with a 57-ball 106 that guided   to a comprehensive win over Rajasthan Royals on Friday.

 
 But the Queenslander was just carrying from where he left off in the Big Bash (331 runs, 2x50s, @36.77, SR 139.07) and the Pakistan Super League (319, 2x50s, 35.44, 135.16). Watson attributes his resurgence to the freedom that comes with playing one format. 
 
 
 
 
 
 There is no doubt that things went my way tonight. Some days you mishit and the edges get dropped. That’s the way it happens. My real motivation was that I was playing my old team Rajasthan, and I am happy it worked tonight.
 
 
 
 Obviously a century is a nice thing but to bat well at this stage of my career like I’ve probably over the last three or four months (in Big Bash and PSL)… In the previous couple of years I just wasn’t at my absolute best at RCB. But I’m always learning, always trying to get better, working on different things to be at my best.
 
 
 
 I am playing only T20 cricket, it definitely helps. When I was playing for Australia, I was changing form all the times. It’s a challenge. When you are coming off a Test series and going into the T20 mode, it takes a bit of time to find your feet. Some players do it easily but I always found it challenging to try and get up to speed quickly. Playing only T20 cricket, all I am doing is practising T20 skills. It’s an advantage for me. For a period of time, I wasn’t sure whether I was going to continue playing. But I realised that I loved playing more than anything.
 
 
 
 I understand the reality of franchise cricket — obviously they had their reasons why they didn’t pick me up. In the end for these franchises, it’s business. I’ve been incredibly fortunate through my career to first get an opportunity at Rajasthan.
