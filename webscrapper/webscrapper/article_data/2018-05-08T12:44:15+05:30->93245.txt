MOTIHARI:   district magistrate Raman Kumar has directed the district transport officer (DTO) and DSPs in the district to crack down on private   which are running as stage carriers without valid permits on long-distance intra-state as well as inter-state routes.

 Sources said most of the owners of these private buses, who operate the vehicles clandestinely, have been using tourist bus permits to ply on these routes thereby causing loss to the transport department. More than 20 buses ply from Raxaul, Dhaka, Ghorasan and Motihari to Guwahati, Kolkata, Delhi and Ranchi on all India permit for tourism purpose. 
 
 DTO Dilip Kumar Agrawal said 12 buses have been seized in the last two days as they had no valid permits.
 
 The directive came after a Delhi-bound bus fell into a roadside ditch on National Highway-28 and caught fire near Kotwa in East Champaran district last Thursday. Police sources said that the bus was operated from   to New Delhi without any valid permit.
 
 Meanwhile, police arrested one Rajdeo Yadav on Monday, who was the co-driver of the ill-fated bus which met with an accident last Thursday. 
 
 Rajdeo got his right leg fractured in the accident and was undergoing treatment at Motihari sadar hospital, while bus driver Bijyendra Gupta had managed to flee from the spot leaving him alone.
 
 “Rajdeo in his statement to the police said that since he was sitting on the rear seat of the bus and was not aware of the cause of accident,” said East Champarna SP Upendra Kumar Sharma adding, “Sanjay Agrawal of Ghaziabad district is the owner of the bus. A police team has been sent to Ghaziabad to verify Rajedo’s credentials and arrest the driver. He will be sent to judicial custody after a medical check up. Kotawa police have lodged a case after the bus accident and investigation is underway.”
