MUMBAI: Several   are participating in the indefinite strike following which the number of cabs have been reduced drastically on road in the morning peak hours.

 The strike has been called by  , the transport wing of Raj Thackeray-led MNS party in Mumbai. Union president   said protestors are demanding better earnings and more monthly incentives as some are living hand-to-mouth existence.
 
 The cabs which are plying on road, specially Uber, are charging surge price which is nearly two times the normal fare. Sources said some of the drivers are not operating out of fear of cabs being attacked by protestors.
 
 
  
 
 Scores of commuters are facing inconvenience due to the indefinite strike strating from today. The city has more than 30,000 aggregator cabs and thousands of office-goers will be majorly hit. Many commuters prefer sharing app-based cabs to their workplace.
 
 Aggregator firms are appealing to drivers to stay online and serve commuters who depend on the cabs for daily travel.
 
 The Mumbai police have decided to step up bandobast on road and may invoke section 149 (unlawful assembly) to detain protestors in case they take morcha to Ola and Uber offices, sources said.
