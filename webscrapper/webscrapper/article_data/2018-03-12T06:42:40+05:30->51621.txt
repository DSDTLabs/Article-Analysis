NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel has appreciated the government’s decision to fix minimum support price (MSP) of 22 crops at minimum one-and-a-half times the production cost but suggested the government consider its earlier recommendations so that farmers can get “comprehensive justice”.

 Those recommendations include need of region-wise MSP, broad-basing of data used by the   and Prices (CACP) to fix support price and enhancement of farmers’ representation in this body.
 
 “The committee are of view that issue of fixation of MSP needs a comprehensive reorientation in order to ensure remunerative prices of agriculture produce,” said the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture, headed by   MP   and comprising of members from all major political parties.
 
 The committee’s report, tabled in Parliament last week, appeared to be fine with the A2+FL (actual paid out cost plus imputed value of unpaid family labour) formula for calculating cost of production for fixing MSP. It, however, flagged demands and suggestions from various stakeholders, including farmers and eminent scientist M S  , to fix MSP using C2 formula which takes into account rental value of owned land and interest on fixed capital apart from A2+FL.
