PANAJI: Although the   (GMC) has restarted its kidney transplants facility and is aiming for liver transplants in the near future, experts believe it will not only have to put a regulatory framework in place first, but will also have to create greater public awareness about   donation. 

 Speaking at a transplant coordination induction training at GMC on Thursday, medical practitioners said Goa has to do a lot of ground work in the field, even as they shared the experiences of states like Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.
 
 “Identify key individuals to take the programme forward, have a regulatory framework in place and prioritise medical ethics,” former convener of the cadaver transplant programme in Tamil Nadu, Dr Amalorpavanathan, said. He explained that the south Indian state could make progress in organ donations and transplants because its government had worked out detailed rules. “The step-by-step orders brought clarity to organ donation and transplants there,” he said.
 
 Amalorpavanathan also spoke about the importance of regulations to certify brain deaths, having an advisory committee in place to ensure fair and just organ distribution and developing an organ sharing network. He warned that the government, while incorporating private hospitals in the programme, should ensure it is not used for their benefit. 
 
 Liver transplant surgeon at Medanta Medicity, Gurugram, Dr Prashant Bhangui, suggested that the GMC begin its groundwork right now if it intended to begin liver transplants say 1.5 years later. He said the hospital could alternatively take smaller steps by introducing corneal and skin transplants. 
 
 Dr  , secretary of the   (ROTTO), Goa, said the state could begin by trying to grasp the scope of the problem.
