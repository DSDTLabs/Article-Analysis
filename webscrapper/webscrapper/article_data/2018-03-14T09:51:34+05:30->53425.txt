HYDERABAD: After launching a 48-hour hunger strike at   on Tuesday evening, the   leadership is seriously exploring the option of mass resignations by party MLAs and MLCs.

 “This is a war between the people of Telangana and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s family. The time has come to oust   from power and save the spirit of democracy in the state. KCR ko hatao, Telangana ko bachao,” said   chief Uttam Kumar Reddy.
 
 Senior party leaders have, however, decided that it is not an issue to be decided in haste and that the party high command in Delhi will be consulted before a final decision is taken.
