CHARMINAR: The issue of open spaces for   in the   has led to a tussle between   and residents on one side and the   (GHMC) and others on the other. Case in point: the   Ground. 

 At the recent Prajavani held on March 6, Shah Ali Banda corporator, Mohammed Mustafa Ali lodged a complaint saying that the vehicles have been parked at the ground illegally. He asked for a complete halt on the activity even as he demanded that the ground be made safer for which he sought two security guards.
 
 "For the past two months, children have not been able to play football in the ground. Further, senior citizens who like to come out for a walk early in the morning or late in the evening are facing problems. The traffic police has also allowed vehicles to park here. I have brought it to the attention of the deputy mayor Baba Fasiuddin," the corporator said.
 
 Many vehicles, including private buses are also being parked, much to the chagrin of residents. They said that the parking of vehicles has robbed them of playgrounds. "The space is being used as a parking lot by tourists who come to see Chowmahalla Palace and other historic structures here. We hope that this menace ends soon," said Mohammed Waseem, a resident.
 
 The Prajavani complaint was forwarded to the GHMC's sports director Prem Raj. For their part, the civic body, including zonal commissioner (south) Srinivas Reddy, confirmed that they have not entered into any agreement with any person or company to permit the use of the ground as a parking lot.
