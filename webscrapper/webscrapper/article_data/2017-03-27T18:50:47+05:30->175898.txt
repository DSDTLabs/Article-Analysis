New mommy on the block 
  is back in action and how! The actress, who gave birth to her baby boy   in December, is gearing up for the shoot of her next ‘Veere Di Wedding’. But before she dives headlong into work, she is treating herself to a mini-vacay of sorts.
 
  is currently holidaying in London with husband 
  and her little bundle of joy. The actress seems to be having a gala time in the British capital with her friends. We stumbled upon these pictures where Kareena can be seen chilling with her friends Rhea Kapoor, Sandeep Khosla and Faraz Manan. Must say, she looks absolutely stunning in these pictures. Don’t you agree?
