Ahmedabad:   (KCA) will mark its 33rd anniversary on Friday by inaugurating an exhibition showcasing the works of Piraji  , renowned Indian painter and sculptor. The exhibition will be inaugurated by Sangita Jindal, chairperson, JSW Foundation and Dr Jayanti Ravi, commissioner and principal secretary, rural development. Piraji’s popular collages and sculptures will be displayed at the Kanoria Gallery for Arts. 

 Thirteen other artists from KCA will also showcase their graphics, paintings, sculptures and installations.
 
 At ‘Art’17’, a discourse on various art forms will be initiated on Friday and Saturday, where people from the artists’ fraternity will converse on the transition of art trends through ages and the evolution of the contemporary genre. 
 
 The first edition of the event will also pay a befitting homage to Piraji, who inspired the establishment of KCA, an art centre that embraces various forms of art and its transition over a period of time.
 
 Urmila Kanoria, founder, KCA, said about the effor, “When I moved to Ahmedabad, there was hardly much on the art front in the city.   then not only supported my idea, but also inspired me to set up an art centre.”
 
 “In fact, he gave me a variety of items from his collection to put up at the gallery without asking for anything in return. He was never clung to his creations and seldom worried about the price they fetched,” she said.
