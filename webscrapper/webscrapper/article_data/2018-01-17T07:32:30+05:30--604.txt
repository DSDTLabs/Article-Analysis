RAJKOT: Kothdi,   7km from  , has a population of just around 700. But large number of villagers here consider Israel their second home. For the 25 years, at least 70-80 villagers of   are settled in Israel, doing various kinds of jobs. The shift began in 1990s when Jivabhai Muliyasiya and his younger brother Savdas first decided to test the waters in Israel. The farmer brothers were, in fact, the first among the villagers to go abroad. Both of them are Israeli citizens since 1995.

 “I was studying agriculture at a Mangrol college. My professor was influenced by the success of Israeli technology in farming. I accompanied him once to Israel and the rest was my destiny,” said Savdasbhai, who runs a cyber-security and banking technology firm in the capital Tel Aviv. He has 10 employees, all locals.
 
 Savdasbhai, who started as a caretaker of old people there, is also part of the business delegation of Israeli PM   on his India visit.
 
 He makes it a point to visit Kothdi as many times as possible in a year. Talking to TOI over phone from Mumbai, Savdasbhai said, “It is very difficult to get Israeli citizenship. Army training is compulsory for every citizen and I have also undergone it. I started work as a caretaker of old age people and then set up my own business.”
 
 He said, “My company provides Israeli technology to some of the Indian banks. We provide cyber security and technical support to banks to protect them from burglary.”
 
 Gradually, Savdasbhai helped more than 60 villagers to settle in Israel.
 
 Hardasbhai Vara is one of them, who recently came to India. He has a three-and-a-halfyear-old son who was born in Israel during his and his wife Aarti’s eight-year-long stay there. “We were attracted towards Israel because people there are very humble and believe in equality. The salaries too are lucrative.”
