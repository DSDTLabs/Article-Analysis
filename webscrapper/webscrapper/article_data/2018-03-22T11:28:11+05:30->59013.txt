BENGALURU: BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa on Wednesday denied he had signed a memorandum submitted to the Centre by the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha (AIVM) in 2013 seeking independent religion status for Lingayats. The demand was subsequently rejected by the UPA-II government. 

 "I have never signed any document seeking separate status for Veerashaiva-Lingayats. Chief minister   is the one playing with people's emotions and using it for political gain ahead of the elections," Yeddyurappa told reporters here. However, documents, of which TOI has a copy, clearly show he had indeed signed the petition. 
  
  
 He added that Siddaramaiah was poisoning the entire atmosphere and trying to divide society. "Tomorrow, if more communities and castes come forward seeking separate religion status, will Siddaramaiah allow that too? What is the CM's agenda?" he asked.
  
  
 Yeddyurappa, who had kept a low profile on the   issue, vented his anger against Siddaramaiah and said the entire community is opposed to the divisive agenda of the Congress. "Even Congress MLA and AIVM president Shamanur   has opposed the government's decision. He clarified that without understanding the nuances of the inclusion of Veerashaiva-Lingayats (believers in Basavanna's philosophy), Shivashankarappa gave his assent to the government decision. He later retracted his statement and has called for a meeting on March 23 to discuss it," Yeddyurappa said.
 
 He said the BJP will take a call on the Lingayat controversy after the meeting.
 
  
 
 
  BJP national president Amit Shah is scheduled to visit Chitradurga, Davanagere and   next week and meet some of the community's pontiffs who run mutts. The feedback from Lingayat mutts will be used as input for the Centre to take a decision on giving the religion
