NEW DELHI: The ministry of minority affairs is planning to review the viability of multiple embarkation points that have been established over the years for operation of   flights with a view to reduce unnecessary costs involved in organising haj travel while ensuring the best possible facilities for the pilgrims. There are 21 embarkation points as of now and minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Friday that this number could be brought down to around nine at the most. This aspect is being reviewed.

 It is important to study the issue particularly in view of the Supreme Court direction of 2012, he said. The court had called for gradual reduction of subsidy on air travel for haj pilgrims. The court directed that the subsidy be abolished by 2022. Speaking at the conference of secretaries working on minority affairs in different states, Naqvi said in light of the SC order the Centre set up a six-member committee to suggest ways to improve India's haj policy .
 
 At present, national carrier Air India provides highly subsidised air tickets to the haj pilgrims.
 
 A revised haj policy is proposed to be made applicable for the 2018 pilgrimage. The panel will also figure out whether the pilgrims can travel to Saudi Arabia by paying less in the absence of the subsidy .
 
 “The expert committee will give us an idea on how India's haj policy can be improved, how the pilgrims can get maximum concessions and how haj can be managed better,“ Naqvi said.
 
 The ministry though clarified that the decision to set up the committee does not mean that the government has any plan to scrap the subsidy. “The intention is to make an assessment and approach the subject accordingly ,“ Naqvi said.
