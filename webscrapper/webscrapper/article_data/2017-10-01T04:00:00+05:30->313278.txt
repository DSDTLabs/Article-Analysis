Vadodara: Thirty dalit youths from the city embraced Buddhism on Saturday at Sankalp Bhoomi where the father of Indian constitution Dr B R Ambedkar had vowed to fight for equality. The programme was a part of such events that were held from time to time to mark Vijayadashmi.

 The conversion of the youths may have come as a surprise to many, but those who were involved with the process said that a similar event was held in Ahmedabad too on the same day and has been held in the past elsewhere. Organisers said that Vijayadashmi was chosen at the day for the event as on this day Emperor Ashoka had shunned violence for non-violence and Ambedkar had adopted Buddhism as his religion on the same day.
 
 “Dalits have been embracing Buddhism as the religion offers equality. The atrocities have increased on Dalits during the rule of the BJP. Incidents of excesses have been reported in Una, Sharanpur and elsewhere,” said president of Bharatiya Baudh Mahasabha, Ravindra Gadhe. He added that the event was organised at Sankalp Bhoomi this year as it was the centenary year of Ambedkar taking a pledge to fight for equality at the location. He claimed that all who embraced Buddhism were dalits.
 
 Gadhe pointed out that Buddhism has no caste or ‘varna’ system and offers social harmony. He added that it was chosen by Ambedkar as it was of Indian origin.
 
 When asked about the incident BJP city unit president Ranjan Bhatt said that religion was a matter of personal belief. She, however, said that it would be wrong to say that the BJP was not sensitive towards the backward classes. “The party has taken several steps for their welfare,” she said.
