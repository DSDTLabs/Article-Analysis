Four decades separate author   and her son  . But to her, age is just a number. It may sound like a cliché, but it’s real in her case.

 
 Iyer was 41 when she had Re (as the family calls him), who is now eight years old. She didn’t plan late motherhood; it just happened because she married late. Being older and having had a good innings behind her, she was financially far more secure and emotionally confident. “Older mothers tend to set realistic goals and are able to balance multiple things. They are often wiser, smarter,” says Iyer, who was a journalist but gave up full-time work after Re was born.
 
 Younger mothers, at least those under 30, she says, are likely to be more prone to post-birth anxieties. “They fear they may become professionally irrelevant after having a baby. There is a certain anxiety about getting back into their old jeans or tube dresses, or jobs. Older mothers are more relaxed and are ready to accept their bodies for what they are,” says Iyer.
 
 Her son has always seen her with grey hair and never wondered why she’s ‘older’ than his friends’ moms. “Children mirror your insecurities, so if you feel you don’t fit in with younger moms, they will feel the same,” she says. To the whole myth that younger moms are healthier moms she says, “No matter what your age, you have to work to stay fit. I swim, walk, do yoga occasionally. Younger does not necessarily mean fitter,” she says. 
 
  motherhood, Iyer reinvented her career by taking to writing books, starting a blog, teaching. “To each her own, but it’s important to remember that while you raise your child, you must also raise yourself. Ultimately every mother has to find ways to reinvent, to stay relevant.   can’t be your only goal,” she says.
