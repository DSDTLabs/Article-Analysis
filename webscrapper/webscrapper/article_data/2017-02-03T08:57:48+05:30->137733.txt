JALANDHAR: On the last day of electioneering, former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) state convener and now Aapna Punjab Party (APP) chief Sucha Singh Chhotepur said that after AAP leader   revealation about the so-called sting operation on him, people of Punjab have seen the real face of AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal and his men and any vote for their party would be like betrayal with the state.

 Terming Kejriwal as the most sordid person of the country, Chhotepur while addressing a press conference here on Thursday used epithets like crook, cheat and power hungry for him. He alleged, “Kejriwal took crores of rupees from NRIs and other Punjabis through emotional appeals in the name of Punjab. Voting for him after this expose will be betrayal with Punjab.”
 
 He asked people to vote for honest candidates only while ensuring Badals’ defeat. “Congress and SAD were facing a complete rout in Punjab but he brought their people in, gave them tickets and now if these parties get votes, it would be only due to treachery of Kejriwal and company,” he said while addressing a press conference here on Thursday.
 
 “He did this to me as he wanted to become CM of the state. If the Congress and SAD have been able to come up on the scene, AAP leaders from Delhi are responsible for it,” he claimed. “One day Kejriwal, Sanjay Singh and   will have to pay for their wrongdoings,” he added.
