The 18th edition of the annual  , Pushpotsav – Festival of Flowers (March 9 to 11) – at the Mihir Bhoj City Park, Greater Noida, highlighted the growing need for waste management in the residential societies of Noida, apart from lending ideas for alternative gardening like vertical gardens, terrace gardens and tray gardens to its visitors. “Unlike other flower shows in NCR, there weren’t many takers for air-purifying plants as   is cleaner, greener and quieter than Delhi or Gurgaon. People here are more interested in buying flowering plants, seasonal plants and decorative accessories, pebbles and statues for their gardens. The theme flower was marigold and the flower arrangements and installations were quite a hit with selfie-lovers,” said Anand Mohan Singh, Senior Manager, Horticulture, Greater   (GNIDA).

 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  Planters made out of discarded material were a hit with visitors
 
  He adds, “Some of the best-sellers were low-maintenance indoor plants, seasonal flowers, 40 varieties of cactus and bonsai. One of the trends that we observed was that Noidawallahs were more interested in buying eco-friendly planters in ceramic, jute and terracotta.”
