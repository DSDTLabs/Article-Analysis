  Shab is a Bollywood romance drama film directed by Onir and produced by Sanjay Suri and Onir for Anticlock Films, WSG Pictures and Surya  . It stars Raveena Tandon, Arpita Chatterjee, Ashish Bisht, Simon Frenay, Gaurav Nanda and Areesz Ganddi.
 
 
  Raveena Tandon, in her third film this year, doesn’t really stand out. There are moments when her performance is quite credible, but there are others’ when you think you’re looking at a rich socialite from Madhur Bhandarkar’s ‘Page 3’. While Ashish Bisht does look like your typical struggling model, his performance is relegated to that. Arpita Pal, Areesz Ganddi and Simon Frenay do have some chemistry between them, but as individual actors, they don’t make an impact. Onir, with cinematographer Ashish Bisht, has shot Delhi beautifully. It’s interesting how the filmmaker seasons in the city to show what the characters are going through. We need filmmakers like him to have conversations about subjects like same-sex relationships, single mothers, but he needs to have his objective clear.
