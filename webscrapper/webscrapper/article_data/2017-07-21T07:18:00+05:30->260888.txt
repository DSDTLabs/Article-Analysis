Dharamshala: Former minister and BJP leader Kishan Kapoor launched a tirade against state urban development minister Sudhir Sharma for giving wrong facts about the company from Belarus roped in for the skyway project.

 Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Kapoor said the state government entered into a memorandum of understanding with Skyways Company without following proper procedures and checking its financial and technical credentials.
 
 “The company that had signed the MoU had not undertaken any such project anywhere in the world before. A study by the Russian Railways University found that the string Skyways project offered by the company was unsafe and commercially not viable. In fact the company was blacklisted in an east European country for financial fraud,” he said.
 
 Kapoor said that despite the company lacking credibility, the minister took a delegation to Belarus at the company’s expense. 
 
 He said that studies have revealed that the skyway project was viable only for about 300 persons per hour and hence not as public transport. However, in Dharamshala the minister promoted the skyway technology for public transport. Kapoor said that if the BJP was voted to power in the state, the government would order an inquiry into the project.
