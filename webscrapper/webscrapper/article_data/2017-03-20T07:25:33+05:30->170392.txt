 Their Ahmedabad-based agent Imran Vohra had taken Rs 80,000 from each of them and had promised them a job with a salary of Rs 28,000 in Malaysia.

He also alleged that the Malaysian police treated them badly and were forced them to live with many other people in a small cell.
 
 After contacting the MEA, their families had also contacted Panchmahals member of Parliament Prabhatsinh Chauhan, who took up the matter with the ministry.
 
 All five had left for Malaysia from Hyderabad on February 18 and were detained by the police on the airport itself. The families had come to know about their arrests on February 23 through the ministryâ€™s mail. Residents of their village had made grand arrangements to welcome them back.
