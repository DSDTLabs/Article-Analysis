HYDERABAD: Submission of   has been made mandatory in   for admission to junior colleges from the 2017-18 academic year onwards, the   (BIE) announced on Tuesday. 

 In the announcement, the board said the new rule will be applicable to admissions to private, aided, social welfare, tribal and BC welfare, residential and model junior colleges as well as those run by the government. The BIE said all students seeking admission will have to submit a copy of their   card.
 
 The BIE, however, did not explain why it decided to insist on Aadhaar details of students. 
 
 In March this year, the government decided to make Aadhaar card mandatory for filing income tax return and also applying for PAN cards through an amendment in the finance bill.
 
 The Centre on May 19 told the Supreme Court the deadline of June 30 for mandatory linking of Aadhaar with various social welfare schemes could not be extended and said that all matters pertaining to Aadhaar must be heard by a constitution bench which was already examining validity of the law.
 
 Attorney general Mukul Rohatgi had said that linking of Aadhaar with various scheme was being done to ensure that benefits of social welfare policies reach the poor and the government would not extend the deadline. "There is no question of extending the deadline," he said. 
 
 The first UID number was issued on September 29, 2010 to a person in Nandurbar, Maharashtra and UIDAI has so far enrolled 115 crore of population.
