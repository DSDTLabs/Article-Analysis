On his recent visit to Lucknow to promote his television show, actor   remembered the good times he has spent in the city on his various visits. “Lucknow ek cultured city hai jahan ke log badi tameez se pesh aate hain. The hospitality of Lucknowites is totally different and lagta hai ke koi ganwaar jagah pe nahi aayen hain. Ab toh it looks like a metro,” says Ranjeet.
 
  Contrary to his image of a dreaded villain, in real life, Ranjeet is a teetotaller and a non-smoker. Also a strict vegetarian, Ranjeet is very fond of greenery. “I saw these shops selling beautiful plants near the KD Singh Babu Stadium and bought several to take back with me to Mumbai. While we were shooting for the film Behen Hogi Teri in Lucknow, there was a person called Ashish who took me to his house and gifted me a bonsai as a token of love,” shares the actor.
  
  Not acting in too many films, Ranjeet says he prefers doing more of TV shows than films these days. He is seen the show Trideviyan these days. “Movies main actor ka limited scope hota hai. We have to fold the character within two hours in a film, whereas in TV, we can enlarge the character according to our will and carry on the show on a longer track. But I am not greedy to earn more from films. TV is satisfying me more that is why I am happy continuing with it.”
  
  Once known as the bad man of the industry, Ranjeet recalls his first scene as a rapist in a film. “Being an actor, while I was very cool about it, my parents were livid with me when they saw what I had done in the film. My mother was extremely hurt and angry and said, ‘ab hum duniya main kya munh dikhaayenge. Tu ye sab kya kar raha hai parde pe?’ So I took the help of my co actor to explain to my parents that it was all for a film and not done in real life by me. She and I made them them understand that it was acting, not reality,” says the actor.
