CHENNAI: The   postal circle has cancelled the postmanmail guard direct recruitment exam which was conducted on November 11 last year. This was the exam where candidates later found that men from   had topped even the Tamil Exam.

 A notification was put up on the website dopchennai.in.
 
 The exam had a 25-mark section to check proficiency in Tamil, around 25 people, who have scored more than 70 out of 100 are from   and Haryana. The exam was held to fill around 300 vacancies. Several candidates from the state, who failed to secure a job, had then alleged that all was not right.
 
 When the results were announced in March, many candidates from   and other districts cried foul and conducted press conferences to blow the lid of the scam.
 
 The exam, although it had a section to check  , was open to candidates across India. Applications were invited for 44 divisions.
