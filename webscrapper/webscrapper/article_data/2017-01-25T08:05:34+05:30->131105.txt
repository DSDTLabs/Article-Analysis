 “I boarded the Hasnabad local from Basirhat station around 9.40pm on Monday . Nearly 30 minutes after arriving at Haroa station, most of the passengers got off the compartment. As the train left Haroa station and I left my seat, the youths sitting at a corner rushed towards me and made an indecent proposal. While I strongly opposed to them, they tried to molest me. I cried out in horror but there was nobody to help. Then I desperately tried to fight them and they pushed me off the running train,“ the woman narrated her ordeal to police and her rescuers.
 
 Barasat GRP OC, Dipak Pyne, however, claimed there were railway police personnel in both the women's compartments of the Hasnabad local. “We found several inconsistencies in her initial statements. We have already initiated a suo moto case,“ he said.
