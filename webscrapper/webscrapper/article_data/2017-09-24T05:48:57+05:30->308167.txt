AHMEDABAD:   anti-terrorist squad (ATS) on Saturday arrested Sriramula Venkatam, wanted in a case registered in 2010 at Kamrej police station of Surat district. The case was regarding   activities in the area. Sources in the Gujarat ATS said that Venkatam used to head the team of naxals in Kamrej which was planning to carry out disruptive activities in the area.

 Senior sources in the ATS said that while a warrant was issued against Venkatam by a Surat court because he was absconding for about seven years, they received a tip-off that the the wanted man was based at Hyderabad and running a small-time travel agency and also working as an estate agent.
 
 “We dispatched a police team headed by Inspector Nikhil Brahmbhatt to Hyderabad and arrested him. He has been brought to the city by air. We will be handing him over to the Surat district police as he is wanted in a case,” a senior ATS official said.
 
 It may be mentioned that earlier, in August 2017, Gujarat ATS had tracked one Tushar Bhattacharya from Nagpur. Bhattacharya was also another alleged Naxalite who had been absconding. “He was also wanted in the case registered at Kamrej police station,” an ATS official said.
 
 Sources in the ATS said Venkatam allegedly operated in Orissa,   and Hyedrabad. “They had conspired to start Naxal activities in Surat but had to scrap their plans. “Venkatam had spent three years in jail in Orissa and then in Hyderabad. He was a key member of a naxal outfit,” said an ATS official.
