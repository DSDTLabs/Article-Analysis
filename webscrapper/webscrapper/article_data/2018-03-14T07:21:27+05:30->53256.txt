LUCKNOW: Abu   has sought police help in a land dispute case and sent a registered letter to the Saraimeer police station in his native town Azamgarh in this regard. The 50-year-old gangster, who is lodged at Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai, has accused six people from his native village Pathan Tola in Azamgarh of having encroached his ancestral land. 

 "The letter bore a jail stamp and Salem's name in the end. Salem's family is involved in a land dispute with some locals and wants us to intervene," Saraimeer SHP Ram Naresh Yadav told TOI over phone on Tuesday. Salem, whose name was once a terror in  , has appealed to police to get 160 hectare land free from unauthorised construction. 
 
 
 
 Police say the major part of the land in dispute has remained inhabited for decades, and at least 50 families, including that of Salem, have built houses and shops on it.
 
 “Salem’s brother Abu Hakim is constructing a three-storey shopping mall on the said land and wants adjacent land parcel as well,” said the SHO, explaining the reason for Salem’s letter.
 
 Salem has alleged that the six people named by him, who live near the disputed land, have colluded with revenue department officials to get the land mutation records changed.
 
 However, Azamgarh DM Chandrabhushan Singh denied the charges. “We will go through the fresh complaint and take action if new facts come to light.” The matter had been probed before as well, Singh added.
 
 Salem’s nephew and Hakim’s son Arif alleged that some people had encroached the land several years back and were allowed to live there out of humanity, but now they are claiming ownership.
