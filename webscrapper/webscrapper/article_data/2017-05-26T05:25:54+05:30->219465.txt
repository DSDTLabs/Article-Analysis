KOCHI: In a decision aimed at restoring academics to its pre-eminent status in the curriculum, the ministry of human resource development ( ) has instructed the state board to do away with   awarded to students excelling in arts, sports and other extracurricular activities. This will come into effect from 2017-18 academic year.

 “This decision was mainly because those students who work rigorously in academics were scoring lesser than those who weren’t due to grace marks being awarded,” director of public instructions (DPI) KV   told TOI. Mohankumar revealed that the instruction was given to all academic boards at an MHRD meeting two months ago. He said that the letter instructing the same has been issued to the state government secretary.
 
 The move to do away with the system of grace marks has evoked intense but mixed reactions in the state, with some saying that it will act as a necessary curb on unhealthy trends that grace marks have spawned in the ruthlessly competitive annual state school kalolsavams, while others argued that it defeats the original intention of providing promising athletes and sportspersons a level playing field.
 
 Noted actor and classical dancer  , who was Kerala’s first Kalaprathibha in 1986, said that exclusion of grace marks will be a boon for kalolsavams which are riddled with chaos and corruption.
