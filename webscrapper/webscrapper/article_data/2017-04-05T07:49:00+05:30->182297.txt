NOIDA: ‘Oxygen bomb’ plants are not just air purifiers but also efficient in pollution control.   based environmental NGO,   (CEIS), are distributing sansevieria giant, sansevieria dwarf, aloe vera, musli, syngonium, lemongrass among others, door to door at minimal costs.

  CEIS members claim to have cultivated air purifying plants in great numbers and make them accessible to Noida residents at inexpensive price rate between Rs 50-200. 
 
  “We started growing these plants based on scientific reports explaining their efficacy in pollution control. Some of these plants like sansevieria remove toxins and generate oxygen round the clock,” said Amrit Kapur, CEIS vice president.
