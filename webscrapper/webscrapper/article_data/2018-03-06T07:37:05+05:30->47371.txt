CHANDIGARH: A day after TOI reported about schools violating Section 13 of the Right to Education Act by resorting to assessment, entrance test and interactions for   to classes I to VIII, two schools modified their websites and removed terms likes 'assessment' and 'admission test' from their admission guidelines. TOI has in possession the screenshots of the websites before and after the changes were made. 

 A Manimajra-based school was the first to modify the admission guidelines on Monday, after which it read, "Selection is purely on the basis of an interaction and the result of the previous class in   and LKG and for classes I to VIII selection is purely on the basis of an interaction and the result of the previous class." Other school in Sector 9, Panchkula, also changed the guideline on their website, which now reads, "On payment of the prescribed fee the candidate will be registered. They will be given a registration form." Parents/guardians were asked to submit required documents.   said, "We will look into the matter on Tuesday."
