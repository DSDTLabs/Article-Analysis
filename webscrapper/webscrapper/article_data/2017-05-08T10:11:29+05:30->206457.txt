BENGALURU:   was only known for troubling batsmen with his off-breaks but the West Indian proved that he can be even more destructive with the bat. Narine was tried as opener in the Big Bash League in Australia earlier this year and Kolkata saw that as an opportunity to experiment with the West Indian. Their efforts seemed to have paid off as Narine made maximum impact with the bat, giving the team brisk starts.

 On Sunday, against  , Narine (17-ball 54) was at his best as he slammed a record-equalling fifty. His association with   powered Kolkata to 105 runs in the powerplay overs - the highest ever in  . In the pro cess, Kolkata became the second team to achieve the fastest team 100 (36 balls) after Chennai Super Kings.
 
 
  
 Astonished by the performance of the openers, Kolkata spinner Piyush Chawla said the duo's batting in the powerplay overs did the trick for the visitors. "To be honest, I have never seen such hitting. I think the way Lynn and Sunil batted, they took the game away from RCB in the first six overs itself," he said.
 
 Asked whether Narine's stepping as opener adds any pressure on all-rounders, Chawla said: "It depends from role to role because he's coming to open the bat and he's given that particular role to just go and play his natural game. Somebody like me, who bats at 7 or 8, get to face 8-10 balls and my job is to see the team through if I have a chance," he said.
 
 Meanwhile, a disappointed Bangalore batsman   too felt that Kolkata made most of the powerplay overs to take the game away from the hosts. "Resultwise, it is disappointing. I thought we put up a good score, about par for that wicket. Obviously batters came and put some pressure (on us) and took advantage of the first six. Yeah, it's been disappointing. We never got any momentum throughout the tournament," he said.
