KOLHAPUR: The   has decided to convene a public meeting, "Aamsabha" here on April 30 to push for reservation. 

 The community had organised over 40 rallies in the state last year, putting forth various demands ranging from reservation in jobs and education, scholarships and changes in the  .
 
 Over the last few months, however, the demands were relegated, and Maratha bodies believe another attempt should be made to put their demands before the government. Over 10,000 people from Kolhapur district and delegates of several organisations will attend the meeting. Also, top   are likely to be invited. A similar event was held in 2014 and was attended by then chief minister Prithviraj Chavan. He had promised several sops to the community.
 
 Vasantrao Mulik, Aamsabha convener, said, "We have started the process to invite the delegations. We will be using social media to expand our reach."
 
 Several speakers will address the people on the day of the event. Separate discussions will be held over the issues faced by the women from rural areas and suggestions to improve their living standards.
 
 During the recently announced budget, the state decided to set up Rajarshri Shahu Maharaj Research Training and Human Development Institute (SARTHI) on the lines of Pune-based Babasaheb   (BARTI).
