GAYA: The Gaya police conducted   at suspects hideouts of Chakand police station   Pawan Kumar, who escaped from custody in the wee hours of Sunday.

 
 The SHO was arrested on Saturday night on the charge of receiving bribe from bootleggers and releasing two alleged liquor smugglers. The SHO is alleged to have received a bribe of Rs 1.16 lakh, which was recovered by a team led by SSP Rajiv Mishra.
 
 After the arrest, the SHO was kept in the office of Gaya DSP (law and order) for quizzing prior to his production in the court of the chief judicial magistrate, but he escaped from there.
 
 “The absconding SHO has already been put under suspension. Departmental proceeding will also be initiated against him. He will ultimately be brought to justice,” SSP Mishra said.
 
 Asked about the role of police officers from whose immediate custody the SHO fled, the SSP said ASP Sanjay Bharti has been asked to inquire into the incident. “Follow-up action will be taken on the basis of the ASP’s report,” the SSP said.
 
 Agreeing that responsibility has to be fixed, the SSP said that the ASP's report would make things clear.
