BATHINDA: Toughening its stand on setting up of solid waste management plants in Punjab, the National Green Tribunal ( ) made it clear that such plants could not be treated as commercial ventures. It is the constitutional and statutory obligation of the state, local authorities and residents to maintain decent and clean environment, the tribunal has stated.

 The municipal solid waste collection, segregation, transportation and disposal is the obligation of the state and local authority primarily, but it also provides for participation of residents and therefore is incapable of being treated as a pure and simple commercial transaction, the NGT bench headed by chairperson Swatanter Kumar observed on Tuesday while hearing the case about the progress of setting up the plants at four clusters. The copy of the order was made available on Thursday.
 
 Punjab additional chief secretary   and secretary (local government)   were present at the hearing. Though NGT had directed the chief secretary to be present, due to some emergency he did not turn up for the hearing and the matter was further posted to October 3.
 
 Chandra told TOI that, “The state government is considering setting up five solid waste management plants at Bathinda, Ferozepur, Ludhiana,   and Amritsar. Bathinda plant is already functional and the one at Jalandhar will be shifted and the clusters will be discussed at the next meeting on October 3.”
