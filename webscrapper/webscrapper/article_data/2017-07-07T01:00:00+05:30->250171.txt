BANKA: Four police personnel were arrested after they were caught drinking   at a police outpost near railway station here on Wednesday night.

 The arrested cops, who were tested positive for alcohol in the breathalyzer test, have been suspended by Bhagalpur SSP Manoj Kumar. The quartet – Shashikant, Rajiv Ranjan, Madhukar Suman and Robin Kumar Pandey – were produced in a local court from where they were forwarded to jail on Thursday.
 
 Taking strong note of the offence committed by the policemen, the SSP has initiated departmental proceedings for their dismissal from the police service. Police sources have not ruled out the possibility of the arrested cops’ links with liquor smugglers. 
 
 After receiving information regarding binge drinking inside the police outpost near the railway station, the SSP raided the police outpost along with other policemen. The four police personnel were found drinking India-made foreign liquor inside the police outpost. They were immediately taken to the GRP police station in an inebriated condition. Sources said the two arrested police personnel were working as clerical staff at the SSP’s office and the other two were posted at Bhagalpur police line. 
 
 A red car of one of the arrested cop, which was found parked near the police outpost, has also been seized by the police. “Departmental proceedings have been initiated against the arrested policemen. They will have to face consequences for violating prohibition,” a visibly angry SSP said.
