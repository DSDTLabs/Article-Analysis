AURANGABAD: The Nanded division of the South Central Railways went into panic mode on Friday after a   was found on the tracks near Rotegaon railway station on the Aurangabad-Manmad route.

 The detonator was spotted by station master   around 8.40am while he was on his inspection round of the station, which is about 61km from the Aurangabad railway station.Baranwal brought the matter to the notice of the   (GRP) and the   (RPF), which rushed their units to the spot. The   also went there but found no explosive device around which could have been triggered by the detonator.
 
 Ruling out any terror angle, police officials concluded that the detonator could be one of those used by well-diggers. Aurangabad superintendent of police   said the manufacturer was being traced from the details on the detonator. This would help track down the people who purchased it.
 
 The Vaijapur police along with the local crime branch will conduct a joint probe in the case. Besides, the GRP and the RPF are carrying out a parallel probe. A case under the Explosives Act has been registered with the railway police.
 
 A senior officer with the anti-terrorism squad said, "There is no cause for panic. The seized detonator was an igniter used for triggering gelatine sticks. It needs a complete circuit, which includes a battery, to set off a blast."
 
 In May last year, the Aurangabad city police had found electricial igniters at the Aurangabad railway station. It was suspected then that the devices were forgotten at the station by well-diggers.
