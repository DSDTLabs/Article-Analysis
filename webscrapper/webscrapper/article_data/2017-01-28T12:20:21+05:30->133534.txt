 He added that the civic body is also not filling up the posts of drivers, which have fallen vacant. 
 
 “Since five years, we have been demanding that the corporation fill up the vacant posts. In fact, in 2010, the civic body had issued an advertisement inviting applications for 80 vacant posts. We are demanding that we should be appointed on these vacant posts,” said Pandit. 
 
 The contract workers had staged a similar protest before Diwali festivities last year.
 
  “We had received an assurance that no further contractors will be roped in by the civic body and that either all will be absorbed on the vacant posts or hired as daily wagers. But the current contractors’ term is ending in February-end and the civic body has already issued tenders inviting another contractor,” he said.
