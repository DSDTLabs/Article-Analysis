GHAZIABAD:   on Saturday demolished a   that was illegally built on a green belt in Indirapuram township’s Shakti Khand, Phase 4. The action came in the wake of a TOI report last month, which highlighted illegal occupation of a 500-metre stretch of green belt along the Sucheta Kriplani road in Shakti Khand where several banquet halls, religious sites and a fuel station have come up without the GDA’s permission.

 Following the report, the Meerut divisional commissioner Prabhat Kumar had ordered a probe into the matter and asked the development authority to submit the findings to him.
 
 Dayanand Prasad, officer on special duty, GDA, said, “The demolition drive was carried out against SR Park Party Lawns and Ambience restaurant on Saturday. The structure was sealed by the   earlier.”
 
 According to GDA officials, in addition to the banquet hall and restaurant, which was demolished on Saturday, there are five other structures owned by three persons, who have taken stay orders against demolition from Ghaziabad courts. Officials said now they will have to wait for the court’s further orders before taking any action against them.
 
 “We have already sealed them, but cannot initiate any further action as of now,” said R P Singh, executive engineer, GDA.
 
 Notably, in an RTI reply, the GDA has stated that it has not allotted land to any such commercial entities or religious sites on the green belt. Alok Kumar, president of  , Ghaziabad, who had filed the RTI query, said the encroachments have come up in the past five years over the land, causing severe environmental damage to the green belt.
 
 In August this year, the   (NGT) had issued notices to the UP government for failing to take action against as many as 118 banquet halls and wedding farm houses operating in the district without environmental clearances. Following the notice, the GDA had sealed 34 banquet halls, but not a single one was penalised on this green belt in that drive.
