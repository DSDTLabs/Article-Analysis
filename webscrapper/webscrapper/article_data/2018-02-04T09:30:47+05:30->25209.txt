AHMEDABAD: More than a year after being put in jail, Gujarat high court has granted bail to Surat-based financier   in connection with   charges after demonetization of high-value currency notes.

 Bhajiawala was booked under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) by   for fraud. Charges against him mentioned he was getting scrapped notes exchanged with new currency notes by filling up forms in various accounts in different banks by hiring multiple account holders. The   held him accused of laundering an amount of Rs 1 crore. HC has ordered to release him on bail on certain conditions including furnishing bail bond of Rs 50,000.
 
 Bhajiawala got bail after the   scrapped Section 45 of PMLA, which was the biggest hurdle for undertrial prisoners to get bail. The provision restrained courts from granting bail because it said that accused in PMLA cannot be granted bail until he convinces court that he is innocent.
 
 Bhajiawala’s bail plea was rejected by the HC a couple of months ago, but the apex court remanded back the matter and the bail plea was heard again.
 
 Accused’s advocate S V Raju submitted that ED’s chargesheet referred to an amount of only Rs 1 crore and the CBI has already submitted a chargesheet in other offences. Hence, there was no justification to make the accused languish in jail. Moreover, Bhajiawala was charged for filling numerous forms after demonetization for note exchange.
