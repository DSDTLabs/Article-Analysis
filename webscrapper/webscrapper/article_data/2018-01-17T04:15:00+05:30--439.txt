Vadodara: The Varnama police arrested a ‘mentally challenged’ man from Por late on Monday night for allegedly having unnatural sex with three cows owned by a milkman.

 The incident happened sometime between Sunday night and Monday morning. One of the cows was found dead by the complainant Lalji Rabari on Monday morning.
 
 When Rabari went to the cowshed on Monday morning, he found legs of three cows were tied with rope and one was lying dead. He suspected Rathodiya, who worked for him as a labourer as she had indulged in a similar act with a calf two years back. Rabari picked him up from his house and handed him over to police.
 
 When cops asked Rathodiya if he had committed the act, he admitted to the crime. Rathodiya told cops that his brother and two other persons were also there with him. However, cops said he was only misleading them and giving dismissive answers.
 
 “When we talked to the villagers, they told us that Rathodiya has psychological problems and he even blabbers when he is alone,” said the official.
