NOIDA: The economics paper leak caused immense trouble to the   students in Delhi-NCR, who had to write the exam twice. But as the results came on Saturday, as many as 242 students scored a perfect 100 in economics, many of them from the districts of   and Ghaziabad. 

 While some of the students had found the re-exam slightly simpler than the previous one, they said they did not expect a re-test. “My first exam had gone very well. But when we got the news that the economics paper had been leaked and we would have to re-appear for the same, it was extremely difficult to accept it initially,” said  , a humanities student of Amity International School, Sector 44.
