NAVI MUMBAI: An elderly couple was attacked with a knife, allegedly by a relative, at their home in Ulwe, Navi Mumbai, on Sunday. While   Gupta (60) died on the spot, his wife, Lakshmidevi (52), has been admitted to hospital. She is out of danger. The alleged attacker,   Gupta (48), is the brother of the couple’s daughter-in-law.

 Sandeep, a Goregaon resident, who drives a cab, was arrested after Lakshmidevi named him in her statement to the police. Sandeep has told the police that he attacked the couple as they tried to convince him to join his father’s business. “Sandeep claims his father does not like his occupation,” said senior inspector   of   Coastal police station where cases of murder and ‘attempt to murder’ have been registered. Police sources said they suspect Sandeep attacked the couple for money.
 
 “Sandeep slit Ram Prasad’s throat and stabbed him in the abdomen, killing him on the spot. He then slashed Lakshmidevi’s throat,” Jadhav said.
