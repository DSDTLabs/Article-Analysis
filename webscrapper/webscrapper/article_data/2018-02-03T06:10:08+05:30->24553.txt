CHANDIGARH: The   on Friday submitted a chargesheet against former   chief minister   and 33 others in connection with an alleged land acquisition scam in   that caused farmers a loss of around Rs 1,500 crore.

 According to the chargesheet, in 2004, the Hooda government issued a notification to acquire 912 acres of land to set up an Industrial Model Township at Manesar, Naurangpur and Lakhnoula. 
 
 However, before the acquisition could begin, builders bought 400 acres of land worth Rs 1,600 crore for just Rs 100 crore from farmers who were led to believe it would otherwise be acquired by the state government at meagre rates. 
 
 In 2007, the director of industries released the 400 acres from the acquisition process in favour of the builders, instead of the original land owners. 
 
 The accused have been charged with, among others, criminal conspiracy, cheating, and various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
