BENGALURU: The abduction of a new-born infant at the   government hospital on February 3 had brought to light the need to ramp up security measures at all government hospitals, health minister KR   told the assembly on Wednesday. 

 Ramesh Kumar said that CCTV cameras would have to be installed at all government-run hospitals in the state. "The hospitals will need to ensure that they have professional security personnel working in three shifts in the maternity and neo-natal wards," he added. 
 
 Admitting that the cost incurred by installation of CCTV cameras in all hospitals would be high, he said, "But we must ensure maximum security in hospitals."
 
 Meanwhile, home minister   said that police was looking into the kidnap case. "The prime suspect in the case is an individual who was seen hanging around with the child's father," he added.
