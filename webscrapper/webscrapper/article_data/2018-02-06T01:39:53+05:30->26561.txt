MUMBAI: A tribal, Baban Mali (45), was allegedly   at close range by his “business partner” following a   dispute in   (E) on Monday morning. The victim’s two   were lucky as the bullets brushed past them but the accused allegedly held them captive, tied them up and hit them on their heads with   at Shilottar village, near Kaman.

 The main accused, Mahendra Thakur, is absconding but three of nine suspects have been arrested.
 
 The families of Mali and Thakur are fighting a court case regarding a property in the village. Thakur and his relatives, including his sisters and brother-in-laws, allegedly got into a fight with Baban’s brothers, Jagdish and Rajender, over the property on Monday. 
 
 Baban went to question Thakur and the two got into a fight around 9am. Sources said Baban and Thakur were partners in selling land in the village. Baban would identify tribal land and Thakur would help him illegally change the land title.
 
 The argument took a murderous turn when Thakur pulled out a revolver from his trouser pocket and fired at Baban. The bullet pierced through Baban’s chest and he died on the spot. Thakur fired a few rounds at Jagdish and Ravinder but the bullets brushed past them.
 
 Thakur fled after committing the crime but angry tribals of the village destroyed furniture at his bungalow and damaged his car. 
 
 Police arrested Shivshankar Thakur, Sushila and Sunita, all Thakur’s relatives. Police, who stepped up security as the village was tense, said they have not yet recovered the weapon.
 
 The accused, who have been booked for murder and attempt to murder, and under the Arms and Atrocity Acts, will be produced in court on Tuesday.
