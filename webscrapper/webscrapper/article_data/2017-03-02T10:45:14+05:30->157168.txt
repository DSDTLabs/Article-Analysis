Zoo rounds on a vehicle will be Rs 100 per adult as against the earlier Rs 30, while for children this ride will cost Rs 50, five times more than before.

 Till the formation of   in 2006, Vandalur zoo was dependent on the state government for funds. But most of the time, money was released towards the end of the financial year which held up development works. With the formation of the authority, the zoo became an independent body. Since then, the gate collection is ploughed back to buy feed and take up development works, said a zoo official.
 
 The official said in 2011- 12, the zoo earned Rs 4.20 crore as gate money. This touched Rs 6.70 crore next year. In 2013-14, gate collection rose to Rs 7.50 crore and then touched Rs 7.90 crore the next fiscal. In 2015-16, earnings peaked at Rs 9.50 crore but this fiscal, gate money took a beating after the zoo was damaged by cyclone Vardah and remained closed till early February.
