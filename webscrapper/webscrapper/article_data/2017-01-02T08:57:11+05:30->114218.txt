Director Vysakh must have been spoilt for choice after his previous movie Pulimurugan broke all the box office records in Mollywood. The director though has gone ahead and picked a project that he has been wanting to do for a long time – the sequel of his debut directorial  , which has  ,   and Shriya Saran.
 
 The director had confirmed the news on Sunday ending speculations on what his next project would be. The upcoming movie titled   will also be scripted by Udayakrisha, who had co-written the first film with Sibi K Thomas.
  
 While we couldn’t reach Vysakh, who is currently on a vacation in Australia, the film’s scriptwriter tells us that the film will be an action-entertainer that will follow the character of Raja, played by Mammootty.
  
 “It’s completely different from the Pokkiri Raja and so the setting is also unrelated,” says Udayakrishna. “It’s too soon to discuss the plot as I am yet to start working on it. The movie follows Raja’s character and the story entirely revolves around him.”
  
 The 2010 movie revealed a few glimpses from the character’s past, which was set in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. However, the scriptwriter says that the upcoming movie will not tread on the character’s past but will showcase a new phase of his life. “The entire setting will be in Kerala,” he says.
  
 So, is Prithviraj, who had played Raja’s younger brother in Pokkiri Raja also part of Raja 2? “We will have to first start work on the script. Only after that we can figure out the cast. Right now everything is at a premature stage and we will only begin discussions after Vysakh gets back from Australia,” he says.
  
 Meanwhile, Udayakrishna is currently busy with the script of another Mammootty project, which will be directed by Ajai Vasudev. The trio had earlier collaborated for Rajadhi Raja.
