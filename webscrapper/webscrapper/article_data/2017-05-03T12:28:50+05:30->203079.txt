 While the definition of single women in the census was limited to divorced and widows, the category has now been expanded to include unmarried women in the new scheme. Also, with the government fixing an age limit of 30 years for “unmarried single women“ in rural areas and 35 years in urban areas, there are around 1.45 lakh women in the state who are unmarried and over 30 years of age as per the state government's household survey .
 
 What's more, the state may have underestimated the burden on the exchequer. It has estimated an annual burden of `400 to `500 crore to provide financial assistance to single women.
 
 Admitting this, a senior government official said: “The new definition is expected to double the number of single women in the state. A comprehensive survey has been ordered by the rural development ministry to estimate the number so that the annual financial burden on the exchequer can be ascertained.“
