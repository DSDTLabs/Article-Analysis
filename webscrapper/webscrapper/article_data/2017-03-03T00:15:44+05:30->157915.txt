The   told the Maharashtra government on Thursday to respond within four weeks to a petition by bar girls challenging the constitutionality of a 2016 state law that virtually banned dance performances in bars, restaurants and hotels.

 A bench of Justices Dipak Misra and R F Nariman issued notice to the state government on a petition by   and told state counsel Nishant Katneshwarkar to file a response within four weeks. It posted further hearing on the petition for April 20.
 
 The association had moved court last week finding that the state government had enacted a new law, Prohibition of Obscene Dances in Hotels, Restaurants and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (Working Therein) Act, 2016, to prohibit dance performances in these establishments to step around an apex court decision frowning at a ban on such performances.
 
 The SC had said the state was within its right to prohibit obscenity in dance performances and had provided safety mechanisms while allowing dance in bars and restaurants. The association said the new law deliberately kept the definition of ‘obscene dances’ vague to enable law-enforcing agencies to target and harass bar dancers and achieve the political goal of imposing a complete ban on such performances.
 
 The petitioner said the new law unreasonably interfered with the right to free choice of expression through dramatic performances and the right of women to practice occupation of self-expression through such dramatic performances.
 
 The association said the law stigmatised dance performances in bars, hotels and restaurants by assuming that all were obscene. It said most performances were a copy of the choreography of Bollywood songs, which were cleared for screening by the censor board.
 
 The petitioner also questioned the provision banning tipping by customers and argued that it was intrinsic to Indian dance performance culture.
