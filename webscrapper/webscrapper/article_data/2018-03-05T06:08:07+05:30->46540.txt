LUDHIANA: The second flight to the Capital is likely to start next month as the test flight has already taken off from Sahnewal airport. The first flight between Ludhiana and Delhi was started on September 2 last year and has been receiving a good response.

 Last year in December, GR Gopinath, founder of  , had indicated that by January, the airline planned to station an aircraft in Delhi to connect the Capital with Ludhiana, Agra, Shimla, Pantnagar, Dehradun and Kullu. The airline will start the service as part of the government’s Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAAN) scheme, which aims at promoting inexpensive regional connectivity.
 
 Director of Sahnewal airport   said the test flight took off 15 days ago. Though the airport authorities didn’t share much details, sources said the test flight was a non-scheduled one and it was a technical requirement before start of the flight operations.
 
 An airport official said most probably the second flight will run in the afternoon hours (between 2pm and 5pm). “The flight, Deccan Charters N 28 (with a seating capacity of about 20 passengers), will fly for seven days a week. It is likely to start till the second week of April,” sources added. 
 
 “Already we have an average load of 80% for   flight and sometimes it goes up to 100%. So we are expecting a good response to the second flight,” said terminal manager Mahesh Babbar.
 
 Another official, however, added that the response to the second flight could boost if timings were business friendly.
 
 “The start of second flight from the city to Delhi is good news, but it will help us only if it takes off in the morning and returns in the evening,” said industrialist Daleep Khanna.
