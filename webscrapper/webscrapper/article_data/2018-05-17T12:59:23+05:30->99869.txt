TRICHY: A 35-year-old woman, who has been complaining of severe health complications following a wrong hysterectomy surgery done at the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH), has appealed for euthanasia.

 P   from   on the outskirts of   made this appeal to the dean of MGMGH Dr G Anitha. The abnormal urinary discharge after removal of uterus in August 2017 following a gynaecology problem was the reason that forced her to get permission to end her life. The woman had also asked the dean to kill her 15-year-old son. 
 
 She stated that the health complications prevented her from discharging any duty. 
 
 According to her, she developed some issues and got admitted to the MGMGH on July 17, 2017. The diagnosis brought to light problems in her uterus which required its removal. The surgery also took place at the hospital and she got her uterus removed on August 26.
 
 Akila had already brought the issue to the district collector who had ordered for an enquiry. Since there was no development in the issue, she met the dean and told her to either cure the problem or do mercy killing. 
 
 During the course of the investigation at the hospital, Akila moved the Madurai bench of Madras high court seeking legal remedy. The case is pending with the court.
 
 On receiving her petition, Dr Anitha tried to convince her by assuring to provide treatment, but it went in vain. “The treatment for the rectifying the problem is available for her. Even the state health secretary has asked her to undergo treatment in Chennai. But the woman wants compensation or asks us to allow for euthanasia. Since the matter is sub judice, we have to wait for the court order,” the dean told TOI on Wednesday evening.
