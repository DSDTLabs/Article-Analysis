 In the afternoon trade, Sensex was trading 150 points or 0.43 per cent lower at 34,698, while Nifty was below 10,550.
 
 Markets saw a downward spiral in the last four trading sessions previous week on back of political uncertainty in  . A constant surge in fuel prices coupled with a weakening rupee also sent jitters down investors' spines. However, a truce of sorts between US and China regarding tariffs is expected to bode well for the Street.
 
 In the early trade, IT and PSU Bank sub-indices were outperforming gaining in excess of 0.5 and 1.5 per cent respectively. Pharma and auto scrips were floundering.
 
 SBI, ICICI Bank and   were among the top performing stocks.
