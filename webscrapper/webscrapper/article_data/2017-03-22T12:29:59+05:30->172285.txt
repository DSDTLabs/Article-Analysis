NEW DELHI: India v Australia series was expected to be a hotly contested affair and the scoreline of 1-1 after three Tests is a testament to all the pre-series hype. But the rivalry has spilled beyond the 22-yards resulting in unwanted controversies. On Tuesday, an Australian newspaper created raised eyebrows by calling India captain   as the   of world sports for blaming media "as a means of trying to hide the egg smeared right across his face." 

  Naturally, there was a sever backlash on the Twitter verse with even Bollywood superstar   chiming in. Replying to the Trump comparison, Bachchan took to Twitter to thank Australian media for the same saying by doing this, they have accepted that the firebrand India captain is a winner and the President.
 
  
  
 
  The ongoing series has resulted in several controversies with both the teams making counter-allegations of not playing in the spirit of the game against each other. There have been several moments of heated on-field confrontations between the players of the two sides. After the first two Tests in Pune and Bangalore, it reached to a level that the   and Cricket Australia officials had to engineer a meeting between Kohli and his Australia counterpart   to douse the simmering tensions. 
 
 However, during the third Test in Ranchi, Kohli accused Australian players of disrespecting Indian team physio   after the 28-year-old hurt his shoulder while fielding.   was also captured holding his shoulder, purportedly an attempt to mock Kohli. However, the Australian captain denied the allegations. 
 
  The fourth and final Test starts in Dharmsala from Saturday.
