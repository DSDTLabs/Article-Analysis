PATNA: The functioning of Patna’s constraints-ridden Jayaprakash Narayan International   (JPNI) will be showcased at the three-day Passenger Terminal Expo and Conference, scheduled to be held in Stockholm from March 20 to 22.

 Patna airport director Rajendra Singh Lahauria will present a paper on the topic ‘Working on Constrained Airport’ at the conference. He will also give a live demonstration on the proposals for development of the Patna airport.
 
 To be attended by delegates and CEOs of the aviation industry from over 90 countries, the expo will provide a platform for industry players to address key issues affecting the development of airports.
 
 Lahauria said the Patna airport was selected for participation in the expo on the basis of a report submitted by him. 
 
 The Patna airport building is very old and designed to handle 0.7 million passengers, but is handling passengers more than three times of its capacity. The length of runway at Patna is 2,072 meters with just four parking bays, which together bear the load of 38 arrivals and 38 departures every day.
