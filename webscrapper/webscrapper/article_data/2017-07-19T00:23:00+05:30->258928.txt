Mangaluru/Udupi: A   of a co-operative bank and its gold assayer have allegedly duped the bank to the tune of Rs 64 lakh by creating as many as 93 fake accounts in different names. Both are now cooling their heels behind bars. 

 The scam came to light when Udupi police were investigating into the suicide pact of Shankar Acharya, his wife and two duaghthers.
 
 Shankar Acharya, his wife Nirmala and daughters Shruthi and Shreya, from Padubelle, had committed suicide on July 13. Following their suicide, officials of Innaje Cooperative Bank discovered that most of the 2.7 kg gold jewellery Shankar Acharya had pledged with the bank, to avail a loan of Rs 64 lakh, was not acutally gold but gold-plated ornaments. 
 
 Following this, managing director of the bank registered a complaint with the Bantwal police who, in turn,   bank manager Umesh Amin and gold assayer Umesh Acharya. Police, during thier investigation, found that the duo had colluded with Shankar Acharya to dupe the bank. 
 
 Udupi SP K T Balakrishna told TOI that the duo created as many as 93 fake accounts in different names to give loan to Shankar Acharya as the bank’s rules allowed a maximum loan of Rs 5 lakh per account. “Of the 2.7kg gold jewellery, Shankar Acharya had pledged to avail the loan, only 150gms was of pure gold and the rest was made of silver with 2-3 layers of gold coating,” he added.
 
 He said Shankar Acharya had got a hint on July 12 that he would be exposed for pledging fake gold. “Out of fear, he along with his family members, might have taken the extreme step of committing suicide on July 13 morning. However, the investigation will throw light on if he (Shankar Acharya) poisoned his wife and daughters before committing suicide or it was a collective act,’’ SP added.
 
 The duo were produced before the court on Monday, which remanded them in judicial custody for 14 days. They are booked under IPC sections 408, 409, 480 and 420.
