GHAZIABAD: The vice-chairperson of  , Ritu  , has issued notices to enforcement officials from all its eight zones for meeting just around 28% of the revenue target set for the financial year 2017-18. 

 The eight officials have been given three days’ time to reply, after which the chairperson will recommend to the state government suitable action against them. “For the financial year 2017-18, the   had set a revenue generation target of Rs 500 crore from all its eight zones by way of compounding. But till March 31 this year, Rs 139.41 crore have come in the GDA’s coffers. In percentage terms, it means just 27.88% of the target. This has prompted the GDA vice-chairperson to issue showcause notices to all eight enforcement officers,” said a senior GDA official. 
 
 “They have been asked to explain why no action should be taken against them and have been given three days’ time to reply. If they fail to give satisfactory replies, the vice-chairperson will recommend suitable action against them,” the official added.
 
 The three major heads under which the development agency generates its revenue are trough sale of properties, compounding and through approval of maps. The compounding part is handled by the GDA’s enforcement cell. An enforcement official who did not wish to be identified said many of the defaulters were not willing to pay up dues. “In such cases, we have very little option legally to goad them to pay up. This explains why we have failed to generate revenue,” the official said.
