Though   managed to keep his energy levels high and gave his best at a   programme on January 22, he complained of breathlessness soon after his performance, say sources, and was admitted to a hospital in Delhi.

  Badshah performed in Noida on Sunday, after which he complained of health issues and was admitted to a hospital in Delhi
 
 “He was under doctor’s observation after he complained of breathlessness and went through some tests,” a member from Badshah’s team told us, without divulging other details. A source said that it was stress and fatigue from back-to-back concerts and travelling, which may have taken a toll on his health. “He travelled to Pune, Surat, Mumbai and Delhi (Noida) for his performances, shoots and other work commitments. Looks like it is just because of fatigue that he felt unwell. He has been advised complete bed rest. His family was with him at the hospital,” says a source. However, a source from the hospital in Delhi says that he suffered respiratory problems and it nothing was major. “The reason can be pollution, change of weather, excessive travelling or even fatigue, but it was nothing major and he was discharged on Tuesday,” said a source from the hospital.
