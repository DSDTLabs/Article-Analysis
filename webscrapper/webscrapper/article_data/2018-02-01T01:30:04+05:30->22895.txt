NEW DELHI: After a spate of terror attacks in Afghanistan, PM   called up Afghan President Ashraf   and offered help for the victims. The two leaders also discussed the security situation in the region and the need for the international community to ensure terror safe havens in Pakistan were shut permanently. 

 "Prime minister   called me to offer condolences on the recent senseless killings of civilians by the enemies of humanity," Ghani tweeted.
 
 The Afghan president said he discussed the need for an end to terrorist sanctuaries in "our neighbourhood", an apparent reference to Pakistan, and said India had always been a "good friend of Afghans, sharing our pain and grief".
 
 The Afghan government in a statement said Modi strongly condemned the attacks in Kabul and other parts of the country that killed and wounded many Afghans.
 
 “Indian prime minister told President Ghani that there are safe havens and training centres of terrorists in our neighbouring country which is equipping (insurgents) to launch such terrorist attacks," it said.
 
 According to a report on Afghan TV channel Tolo News, Modi also emphasised the need for talks over the elimination of safe havens and said “the serious combat (mission) against this must continue".
 
 Calling India a real and honest friend of Afghanistan, Ghani said it was time "to act to isolate countries that support terrorists”.
