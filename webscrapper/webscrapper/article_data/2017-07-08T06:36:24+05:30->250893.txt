LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh   chief minister   on Friday said the state needed a fresh   policy as the present   had not been revised since in its formulation in the year 2000. 

 Sharma, who inaugurated the tourism department’s three-day ‘Mango Food festival’ at Paryatan Bhawan, said, “The state has slashed its expenditure on tourism from 2% to barely over 0%. The state government needs to invest more to attract more domestic and international tourists to UP.” 
 
 “We should have more planned package tours, do better branding, promote tourist spots in UP, put up stalls to make people aware of our heritage just like states like Rajasthan and Gujarat have done. With the tourism policy, we should also think of benefiting the economy, creating employment and exporting our products,” the deputy   added. 
 
 Asking principal secretary for tourism, Awanish Awasthi, to work in that direction, Sharma said, “Why can’t we use religious tourism to our advantage? Why can’t we use local customs like Mahoba’s Alha and Udal to build a memorial and use their stories to bring in more tourists?” He also asked officials of tourism department to explore the option of cashing in on regional events like the Dewa Sharif mela and Vrindavan’s famous Holi for their tourism potential.
