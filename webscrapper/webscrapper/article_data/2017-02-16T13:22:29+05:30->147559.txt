BHOPAL: Congress is mobilising its workers from block levels across the state for its February 22 mega demonstration against the   government on five issues, including police action on PCC chief Arun Yadav during an anti-note ban demonstration last month. Party’s media panellist   told TOI, “There are 480 blocks in the state. The party is trying to get workers from all across to ensure participation from every corner of every district.”

 Congress workers will also denounce manhandling of party’s deputy leader of Opposition Bala Bachchan by BJP MP Subhash Patel during a government function in Barwani in January. The party will also assail government’s alleged anti-people policies, demonetisation chaos and atrocities against Opposition party workers.
 
 “Our central leaders Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia have confirmed their participation. We are awaiting nods from Digvijaya Singh, Suresh Pachauri and   though we have been told that they will be joining. AICC general secretary in-charge of Madhya Pradesh Mohan Prakash will lead from the front with Arun Yadav,” Mishra said.
