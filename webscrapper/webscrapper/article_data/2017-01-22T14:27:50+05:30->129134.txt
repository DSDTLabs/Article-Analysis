Things between singer   and   are heating up. 

  
  
 According to a source the 47-year-old songstress is 'head over heels' for the R&b star. "She's head over heels for Drake. It's a new relationship, but she really likes him. She's really into him," the source said. 
 
 The pair first sparked romance rumors in late December, after the 30-year-old rapper visited Lopez at her Las Vegas show. Drake and J.Lo were spotted enjoying an intimate dinner in Hollywood just before  , and celebrated New Year's together. 
 
 However, Lopez played coy when she was asked about her rumored relationship with the rapper. "He just asked me to do a song with him and that's what we've been doing," she had said.
