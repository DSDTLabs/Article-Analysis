NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro’s   is   with   and the figures prove that. On Tuesday, when the   of the corridor   for public, its ridership   by  . The first 12.6 km-long section of Magenta Line between Botanical Garden and Kalkaji Mandir was opened in December last year. On Monday, the Magenta Line saw a footfall of 81,800 passengers but on Tuesday, when the remaining section was opened, its   zoomed to 2,87,413.

 The stretch, meanwhile, faced its first snag on Wednesday that resulted in delayed train services in the evening. “The trains going towards Botanical Garden were moving very slowly and it took 30 minutes to reach Kalkaji Mandir from Hauz Khas,” said Anup Sharma, a commuter.
 
 According to projections made in the detailed project report of the corridor, DMRC expects 3.9 lakh passengers to use the corridor. Even though the Magenta Line has interchange stations at Botanical Garden (with Blue Line) and Kalkaji Mandir (Violet Line), it is the interchange facility at Hauz Khas which has proven to be the game changer. Thanks to the interchange facility available with Yellow Line at Hauz Khas, passengers can now reach Noida from Gurgaon much easily and in less time. The opening of the entire Magenta Line also means that Metro’s overall daily ridership, which had witnessed a massive dip following two successive fare hikes last year, would go up. DMRC, however, didn’t reveal the total ridership witnessed in   network on Tuesday.
 
 “Overall line utilisation of the metro system on May 29 was 45,35,932 passengers. Line utilisation indicates how many passengers travelled on the line or a portion of that line during their overall journey on Metro system,” a DMRC spokesperson said. Simply put, if a passenger interchanges twice and uses three different lines to commute between two locations, DMRC’s system would show three lines having been utilised instead of counting the footfall of one person.
