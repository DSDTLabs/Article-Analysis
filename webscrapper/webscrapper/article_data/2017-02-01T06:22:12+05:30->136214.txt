NASHIK: Artists and social   have appealed to all the   contesting in the civic elections to make the   their priority.

 Marathi actor and cleanliness ambassador of the municipal corporation, Chinmay Udgirkar said, “The condition of the   is still the same as before. It is still polluted. The development of the city will not take place until the Godavari is clean and pollution-free. Political parties only give an assurance, but do not take up the issue on their election manifesto. This time, we want all political parties to take Clean Godavari on their election manifesto.”
 
 The high court has already given a directive to solve the concretization of the river and make it pollution free, but efforts are not being taken by the political parties. “All political parties need to make the Godavari issue a priority on their manifesto. We are also launching a selfie video movement for citizens where they will contribute to the video by saying - Serve Godavari if candidates want votes,” Udgirkar said.
 
 Jal Biradari, an organisation floated by Rajendra Singh for re-establishing community rights over water management is fighting for the Godavari. Pandit said, “Nashik is recognised only because of the Godavari. Today, the condition of the Godavari is not good and it is completely polluted. So, political parties should come ahead and take the issue seriously on their agenda during the civic elections.”
 
 Artists from Janasthan, actors, painters, authors and poets from the region showed support for the drive at a programme held in Ram Kund on Friday.
 
 Sadanand Joshi of Janasthan group said, “Everyday, devotees take a bath in the river, which has lost its holiness as it is polluted. Political parties only give assurances, they don’t keep their promises and implement it. We are the sons of the Godavari and it is our duty to keep the river clean.”
