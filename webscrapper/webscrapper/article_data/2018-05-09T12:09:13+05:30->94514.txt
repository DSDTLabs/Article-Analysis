Lolita Chatterjee, who forayed into Bengali cinema in the ’60s, and became a name to reckon with, is critical. The actress suffered a stroke on Tuesday and was rushed to a city nursing home where she was put on ventilator. Those close to the actress informed that she slipped into a coma after the stroke. The actress, who regularly acted in movies after her debut opposite Uttam Kumar in Bibhas, made a comeback with two back-to-back films last year. She was part of Arindam Sil’s Asche Abar Shabor and Aditya Vikram Sengupta’s Jonaki. The actress had told Aditya Vikram that she was keen on travelling to film festivals across the globe but had to give the Rotterdam Film Festival a miss, because of the extreme weather conditions. Only last year, she underwent a surgery for which the shooting schedule of Jonaki was done in parts. “I am aware of the situation,” said Aditya Vikram, who is currently in Mumbai.
