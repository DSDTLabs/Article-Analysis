PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   ( ) may have skipped several deadlines to launch the bus rapid transit service ( ) on Pune-Mumbai highway but municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar has now set a September target.

 PCMC had widened the 12km-long Pune-Mumbai highway for the BRTS route. It has been trying to start the bus service on the highway for the past five years. There are around half a dozen merge-ins and -outs on both sides of the express corridor, which may cause accidents and therefore social activists as well as certain corporators have opposed the launch. An activist has also filed a public interest litigation in   to prevent PCMC from starting the service without undertaking appropriate safety measures.
 
 Three months ago, the civic body had decided to allow two-wheleers to ply on the BRTS lanes to reduce traffic congestion on the route. However, now four-wheelers are often seen on the dedicated lanes as steel barriers have been damaged.
 
 Speaking to TOI, the BRTS Cell’s spokesperson   said, “PCMC has allotted the work order to renovate its old bus stations to a private contractor on build-operate-transfer basis in lieu of advertising rights for five years. The civic body will take all safeguards to prevent any accidents. We will inform the high court after completing such measures.”
