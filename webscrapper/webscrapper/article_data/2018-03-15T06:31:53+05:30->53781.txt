AHMEDABAD: In a rare instance in the   (AMC) history, no   have come forward to bid for Rs 132 crore worth of   in posh West and New West zones!

 The high court’s strict intervention to ensure road quality is keeping AMC officials on their toes and at the same time demanding accountability from contractors. On Tuesday, it was for the third consecutive time that there were no takers for road job works worth Rs 93 crore for the entire  . A few days ago Rs 39 crore worth of road repair tenders for West zone had no takers. The strict tender conditions, the HC’s demand for impartial quality control and the AMC lodging an FIR against a road contractor for poor construction in Bodakdev has shaken contractors.
 
 Senior AMC officials claim that the fact that no one is bidding for the road contracts also exposes the fact of an existing contractor cartel that has been bagging crores worth of road contracts every year. “By not bidding for contracts the contractor’s cartel is trying to employ pressure on the AMC to taper down tender conditions,” claims a senior AMC official. A cursory glance of the contracts awarded in 2016 and 2017 will reveal how most high-value contracts were bagged by the same cartel of contractors. Between April 6 and July 13, 2017 — in two months — AMC doled out a whopping Rs 205.93 crores for road construction. Many of these roads had not even survived the July rains last year. There were 25 road contracts awarded in this period.
 
 In 2016, from February 9 to December 29, 38 major road contracts worth, Rs 267.69 crore were doled out. Many of those had also not survived one full season. Last year after the July rains when the engineering department had claimed officially that 202 km of roads had completely washed out, the department also claimed that just 18km of them were under the defect liability period.
