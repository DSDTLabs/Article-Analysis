Ponda: With work on the Kavlem sewerage treatment plant at Kapileshwari taking off in January, the Sewerage and Infrastructural Development Corporation of Goa is awaiting the soil testing report from a Mumbai-based labortatory.  The report will have an impact on the pillars and foundation of the plant coming up on the outskirts of Ponda. Construction of the plant was supposed to commenced in February 2016, but got delayed due to opposition from locals. Pollutants have resulted in the contamination of the Ponda nullah, which was once a lifeline of Ponda, Kavlem and Bandora, to a dangerous level.  With an aim to free the nullah from effluents, the sewerage corporation has planned a 15-MLD sewerage treatment plant at a cost of Rs 33 crore. Foundation for the plant was laid by the PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar on February 5, 2016.  Work for the treatment plant was awarded to Khilari Infrastructure Private Limited, a Navi Mumbai unit which has conducted the soil test.  Padmakar Sheldarkar, managing director of the corporation, said the plant is likely to be commissioned within a year. Principal general manager of the corporation Dilip Dhavalikar said the corporation had acquired 7,500 sq mt of land for the project. “The plant would treat sewage and effluents from the entire Ponda municipal area, parts of Curti and entire Kavlem village,” he said. The corporation plans to construct two more sewerage treatment plants at Curti and Undir-Bandora.  The total cost of the project is estimated to be Rs 403 crore, including the 15-MLD processing units at Kawlem (Rs 33 crore), 15-MLD unit at Undir (Rs 45 crore), 8-MLD unit at Curti (Rs 20 crore) and pipe-laying work on a 28-km stretch  “Of the 28-km pipeline network, work on 22 km has been completed. Construction of sewerage collection chambers are also going on at a war-footing and expected to be completed soon,” Sheldarkar told TOI.
