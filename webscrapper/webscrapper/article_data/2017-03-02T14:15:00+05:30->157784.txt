The   is both home and workplace for a group of children there, as they get to work mode on spotting any unattended object. And mind you, they're not just ragpickers or workers, they’re informers for the  . The local cops say that these children act like their eyes and ears. Until a few years ago, these kids used to run away on seeing the police, but the NGO Abhinandan Educational Welfare Society is not only educating them, but has also helped them in getting over their fear of police. The NGO, run by Manisha Bhatia, has been working for the welfare of the kids at the Nizamuddin Railway Station for the last four years. The project started when  , DCP (Airport), who was earlier posted as the DCP (Railways), took the initiative to provide education to these underprivileged children and asked his wife Manisha (from the NGO) to help in the project.

  Talking about the initiative, he says, "These kids know that they are on our watch list, which is why they are not involved in any mischievous activities. When I was posted as the DCP (Railways), I took this initiative with the help of my wife’s NGO to educate them. None of these kids now run away after seeing a policeman, which they used to do earlier. Instead, if they see any unattended object, they bring it to the notice of the police, which is a big change." He adds, "Regular interactions with the police officials have also boosted their morale and changed their relationship with the police."
 
  Manisha Bhatia says, "The police officials have helped us a lot." A health check-up camp was also organised by the NGO at the event.
