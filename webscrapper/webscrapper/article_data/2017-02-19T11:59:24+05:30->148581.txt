AHMEDABAD: While migrant labourers contribute to an urban area’s economy, their living conditions are often found to be poor with a lack of even basic facilities. At least according to a study by Rajasthan-based NGO,  . Around 30% of shelter homes for migrant labourers in Ahmedabad are non-operational, the study found. Several shelter homes for migrant labourers are occupied by antisocial elements and as many caretakers insensitive to the needs of migrants, these workers are forced to live in open spaces, the study claims.

  “According to the   guidelines, there should be one shelter home with a capacity of 100 people per lakh residents of every city. However, there are only 46 shelter homes in Ahmedabad against the required 64, considering the 64 lakh population in the city. Moreover, of the 33 functional home, none are equipped with basic amenities such as drinking water, toilets, cooking spaces, bedding and safe keeping facilities,” said  , programme manager – legal education and advocacy, Ajeevika Bureau.
 
 “There is an imminent need for solutions that offer a secure living space for these communities so that we are able to bring a glimmer of dignity and hope in their lives,” he added.
 
 The study also indicates that workers usually find residential space within factory premises or at on construction sites. “Their food, water and sanitation needs are, however, not taken care of by owners. Workers resort to cooking on brick chullas and using makeshift tents to sleep in at night,” the study said.
 
 Homelessness is a major issue among migrant labourers. “As the implementation of Supreme Court guidelines remain woefully inadequate, it exposes the vulnerable migrant labourers to a host of issues such as financial exploitation and poor health conditions. Moreover, women migrants living in open spaces frequently become victims of sexual harassment, domestic violence and assault,” said Divya Varma, programme manager – policy and partnerships, Ajeevika Bureau.
