LUCKNOW: The   has been witnessing a huge rush of devotees who have been coming to offer 'khichdi'.   is a special occasion for the people of Gorakhpur and Gorakhnath Temple where a month-long 'khichdi fair' is held. 

 Chief minister  , who is also the mahant (head priest) of Gorakhnath Temple, is on a three-day stay in the temple for the occasion. There is a mythological narrative behind the practice of offering 'khichdi' at Gorakhnath Temple. 
 
 As per mythological legend, Goddess   once invited all prominent seers and saints to have a feast at her abode in  . Guru Gorakhnath was also invited but the Goddess was getting non-vegetarian food cooked to his dislike. 
 
 Gorakhnath told the Goddess that he only eats 'khichdi' and asked her to keep water boiling as he would return with 'khichdi' as alms once his 'khappar' (bowl) gets filled. 
 
 The Goddess was aware that Guru Gorakhnath was not comfortable with the food being prepared and that he was not likely to come back but still she started boiling water.
 
  Travelling all the way, Guru Gorakhnath reached Gorakhpur and began meditating. On the day of Makar Sankranti, villagers came to know about a learned sage meditating there and started donating 'khichdi' in his bowl. However, despite numerous offerings, the bowl never filled since Gorakhnath did not want to return to the feast and hence water in the 'kund' at Jwala Devi continues to boil even now.
