BENGALURU: An event to mark the fourth year of the   government in   has put pressure on the district administrations over manpower and money despite a crippling   situation.
 
  The   government, which completes 4 years on May 13, did announce that they would not hold any elaborate celebrations this year as the drought situation is near appalling. The state is going through its sixth consecutive year of deficit rain and the agrarian crisis is extensive.
  
  “We are only holding an event Jana Manana-Jana Namana, where beneficiaries from various state flagship welfare programmes will participate “ social welfare minister   said.
  
  The Programme beneficiaries of Anna Bhagya, Krishi Bhagya, Ksheera Bhagya, Pashu Bhagya, Vidyasiri and others participate.
  
  “The catch is that the government has decided at least 2,000 beneficiaries of these programmes will come from each of the nine districts in the Bengaluru division for the event,” a senior district official, who declined to be named, told ET.
  
  This is causing a stress on the districts. Drought-relief funds are sanctioned separately to the districts, but, in the current scenario, all possible untied funds need to be diverted as the amounts are inadequate to meet the crisis, another official said.
  
  “They have organized buses for transport which will be a strain on the state exchequer . We need to organise food and maybe stay for all the beneficiaries whom we have identified for the programme from our own funds for the May 13 event. The CM will give the required documents and benefits to some of them, the rest of them have already received it, they are just there to show the numbers and the success of the programmes,” he oultined.
