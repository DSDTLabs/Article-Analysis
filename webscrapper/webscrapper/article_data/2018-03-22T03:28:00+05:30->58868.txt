Guntur: In what will be a rare achievement, a   to be performed at Government General Hospital (GGH), Guntur will be telecast live at the prestigious international seminar on orthopaedics to be held in Vapi, Gujarat on March, 23. 

 This live streaming is expected to help GGH gain more popularity on the global platform, as reputed orthopaedic and joint replacement surgeons from around 23 nations are likely to attend the Vapi seminar.
 
 Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, famous joint replacement surgeon Dr Busireddy Narendra Reddy said, “Top hospitals from just five cities from across the nation have been picked for giving a live stream of surgeries at the Vapi seminar.”
 
 “Latest technologies and methodologies in joint replacement will be discussed during the conference. While all cities from the north like Pune, Mohali, Patna, Ahmedabad have been selected, Guntur is the only city to get the honour from south India,” he said. 
 
 GGH orthopaedic wing chief Dr Varaprasad said, “The organisers had earlier granted Dr Narendra’s Sai Bhaskar hospital to perform the live telecast, but Dr Reddy insisted on doing it from GGH as this would make Guntur a global destination for health needs. Dr Reddy has earlier performed 10 joint replacement surgeries in a single day at GGH and set the world record,” he further added.
