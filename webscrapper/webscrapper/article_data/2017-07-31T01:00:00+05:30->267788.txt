Looks like   cops in the city of late are becoming tech-savvy. After using social media to update residents about traffic congestions and other route plans, they have now resorted to point-of-sale (POS) machines to collect fines from traffic offenders. About 100   have been distributed to traffic inspectors in Chennai and the cops have already started using them. 

 A senior official, on condition of anonymity, tells us, “Not everyone carries cash with them, especially after demonetisation. So, to make it easier for us to fulfil our duty, 100 POS machines have been distributed to traffic cops across the city. Plan is on to purchase 300 more machines. We’ve had these facilities before, but they were restricted to police stations. But now, the swipe machines are available with cops who are performing their duty at busy junctions. The system was put in action on July 27.” Thus, Chennai joins cities like Bengaluru, Mumbai and Kolkata, where swipe machines are reportedly being used to collect traffic fines. 
 
 SI Radhakrishnan (J1 Saidapet, Traffic) tells us, “Every time we fine a person for violating traffic rules, we are met with a standard response — we are not carrying cash. So, they have to either run around to find an ATM or go to the station or court to pay the fine. But this move makes the job easier for both cops and the public.”
 
 The major advantage, he says, is that the transactions are transparent. He adds, “When we collect cash from a person in public, many assume that we are taking a bribe. But now, since we are swiping cards, it removes unnecessary doubts from the minds of public. We generate two copies of the transaction — one for the person who has paid the fine and the other for our official record. We also generate a   and give it to them.”
 
 Interestingly, the cops have been given a crash course on how to use the swipe machines. The amount that’s collected will be paid to the government at 6pm every day.
