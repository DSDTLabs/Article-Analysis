SECUNDERABAD: A 200-meter stretch along   in   is turning out to be one of   in the city. This area has heavy traffic as it connects to National Highway-44, and accounts for a large number of mishaps.

 On an average, several hundred vehicles pass through this road every few minutes at high speeds.
 
 The Hyderabad traffic police records reveal that between 2012 and January 2017, 20 people were killed and nearly 100 were injured. The traffic police has now identified the Dairy Farm crossroad 'Category 1' (a location which accounts for frequent accidents).
 
 The second death spot in Secunderabad cantonment is Tadbund crossroad, which connects the state highway-1, officials say. As recent as Saturday, a truck mowed down two riders after the rider lost control of the bike.
 
 Traffic police say a total of 15 people have died and seven injured since 2012, and a blind curve near a graveyard is the major cause for these accidents along the 200-meters stretch.
 
 “NH-44 and state highway-1 also pass through the heart of Secunderabad cantonment. Similarly, arterial roads also cross over through these stretches. Apart from these two death spots, (Dairy Farm crossroad and Tadbund crossroad), we have identified three   in the cantonment,“ says North Zone ACPTraffic, A Muthyam Reddy.
 
 Reddy says that “There are a total of 18 traffic junctions in Tirumalgherry traffic police station limits. But at eight junctions, there are no signals and similarly, at Marredpally traffic police station, of the 14 traf fic junctions, seven junctions do not have signals. Wherever there are no traffic signals, our personnel are deployed and they regulate traffic flow. At a few junctions, CCTVs have been installed and at some others, some of the CCTVs are defunct. Soon, all these defunct CCTVs will be replaced under the CCTVs Project“.
