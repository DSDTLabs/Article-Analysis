NEW DELHI: A   rejected a woman’s plea that sought an order to Delhi Police to register an FIR against Lok Sabha   K C Patel for  , saying she had not approached the court with clear motives. 

 The court noted the findings of the action taken report filed by the police, in which they said that the woman had already extorted Rs 1 lakh from the MP and was demanding Rs 7 crore. They added that she had done so in the past as well with other MPs, ministers and bureaucrats. The police told court that the first such case was lodged by the woman in 1991 against a policeman. 
 
 The woman was arrested on May 2 after the police registered an FIR of extortion against her. The police had also raided her house where they found a camera in the bedroom. “Though one may fall victim to a similar offence again, but the conduct of the complainant revealed in the action taken report of the police suggests that she has not approached this court with clean hands,” the court order said.
 
 The report also suggested that the complainant was not keen on getting the FIR registered and delayed it for manipulating the situation to her advantage. “In these circumstances where the complainant earlier lodged similar complaints against other MPs and civil servants, and thereafter, backtracked from her allegations...this court exercises its discretion not to give direction to the police to register an FIR on her complaint,” the court said. 
 
 Earlier, a court had rejected her bail application on similar observations. The court had noted that on receiving the complaint, the police had requested her for a medical examination and recording of statement before a magistrate, but she had refused. The woman had insisted that no action be taken on her complaint and that her medical be conducted after April 20 as she was going out of Delhi. On April 20, she again came to the police station and gave in writing that she was not feeling well. She did not turn up after that.
