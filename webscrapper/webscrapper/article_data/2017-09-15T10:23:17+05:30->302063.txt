CHENNAI: The time is ripe to stack up your refrigerator with vegetables -prices have plummeted in wholesale as well as retail markets in the city on the back of bumper harvests in several southern states.

The price of local tomatoes, too, has crashed to Rs 20kg, while the variety transported from Bengaluru is now available at Rs 25kg. But the price of coconuts rose from Rs 15 piece last week to Rs 25 piece on Thursday.
 
 V Prabhakar, a retail vegetable merchant in  , said vegetable-producing districts in   and several other states have recorded a bumper crop. “That, combined with low demand, led to a big drop in vegetable prices,“ he said. “After the showers last month, there was a surge in prices, but with large volumes now entering the   market, wholesale and retail prices have fallen.“
 
 R Soundararajan, advisor, Koyambedu wholesalers' association, said, “There are not many takers in the market and cash crunch among buyers could also be one of the reasons. But this is a good time for vegetable exporters as they will be able to get higher prices from exports to the Gulf countries.“
 
 The Gulf nations depend on Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for vegetable supply. Salem, Trichy, Dindigul, Nilgiris and Theniare major vegetable growing areas in the state.
