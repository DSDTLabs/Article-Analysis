BENGALURU: From coins dating back to 600 BC to bank notes,   artefacts. These were among the collectibles for enthusiasts at the three-day  . 

 The event, which started on Friday, saw more than 200 visitors admiring the tokens of history and picking up coins, notes and stamps of their choice.
 
 Mohammed Rafiq, a stationery shop owner and lover of old coins who had travelled all the way from Kerala, said: "I eagerly wait for the exhibition every year as this is my one-stop centre for picking up treasures." He has been visiting the exhibition for over 20 years. 
 
 For Gururajan R, a techie, collecting coins is a new hobby. "This is my second year; I have a lot more to learn. I am planning to buy some antique coins," he said.
 
 Other than coins and stamps, the wooden charkha used by Mahatma Gandhi was an added attraction for visitors, though it was not for sale. There were several hand-written letters by Gandhi to his son, and the official notification issued before his   March in 1930 was one of the rare exhibits.
