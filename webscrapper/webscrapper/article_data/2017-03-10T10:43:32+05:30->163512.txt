VADODARA: On coming out of the ST bus depot in Sayajigunj, you will be greeted by the pleasant sight of colourful paintings. The paintings depicting the eco-system of the city will brighten up the wall that runs parallel opposite the depot and is one of the busiest routes in the city. 

 The civic body has decided to rope in Pithora artists, who, along with the students of the fine arts faculty of the M S University will paint the wall in various hues. 
 
 “It will be the dedication to the Mission Million trees campaign initiated by the   (VMC). The paintings will be of trees, animals, birds and various kinds of flowers. It will be a fusion of the modern art and our local Pithora art,” said Dr Vinod Rao, municipal commissioner. The civic body has already removed some advertisements made on the wall. 
 
 Once prepared, it will be the longest street art in the city as the paintings will cover the one-km long wall. “The idea is to sensitize people towards VMC’s ‘Mission Million’ trees endeavour through the dying Pithora art on the wall of railway station. Pithora artists will co-create a huge painting on this subject with some select students from fine arts faculty. This form of art will spread awareness about conserving trees,” said   who is curating the event. 
 
 “The wall will be full of various trees and life revolving around the trees. It will be a perfect show of a balanced eco system,” Kaluskar told TOI. The city has already seen a fusion of Pithora and western art when two American artists joined hands with some Pithora artists and painted the huge wall of Sir   in   earlier this year. “Such initiatives make the Pithora art popular,” Kaluskar added.
