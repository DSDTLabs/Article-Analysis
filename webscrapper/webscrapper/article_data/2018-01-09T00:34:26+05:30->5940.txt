Jaipur: Annoyed with the state government over recommending CBI probe in cases against Rajput leaders relating to the Sanvarad violence, at least 16 Rajput outfits on Monday declared to boycott BJP in the coming bypolls. 

 Accusing Vasundhara Raje-led BJP government in the state of suppressing Rajput community, Giriraj Singh Lothwara, president of Shree Rajput Sabha, said, “In our agreement with the state government on July 18 there was a mutual agreement that only FIR no. 190 registered at Ratangarh police station, relating to Anandpal Singh encounter case, was to be investigated by the CBI. However, we are disheartened to know that CBI is also investigating other FIRs lodged by the state police which were registered wrongly.”
 
 “The notification also says that other offences committed during the course of same transaction arising out of the said cases to be investigated. That is a clear betrayal by the state government. Cases were withdrawn in the past in Uttar Pradesh and other states and many cases against Gujjars were also withdrawn. However, the state government seems to be in a mood to suppress us. We are not going to tolerate it,” said Lothwara. 
 
 He added that be it the issue of film Padmavati now retitled as Padmavat or Anandpal Singh, the state government is creating a scenario to project Rajputs as villains. “We are not supporting BJP in the upcoming bypolls. We have also written a letter in this regard to CM Vasundhara Raje,” he added. 
 
 At the same conference, other speakers including Hanuman Singh Khangta, president of Shree Marwad Rajput Sabha, Sukhdev Singh Gogamedi, national president, Shree Rastriya Rajput Karni Sena and others added that government is also attacking “Shree Rajput Sabha” the organisation of the community.
