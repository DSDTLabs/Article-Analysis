NOIDA: The Noida Authority has started printing challans pending since September 10 last year after a new printer was sourced from a private vendor. 

 This comes a day after TOI reported that printing of challans generated by the Highway Traffic Management System (HTMS) on the   was stalled as the printers were yet to be refilled with ink. After senior officials took note of the report, a team from the Noida Authority was sent to the Traffic Management Centre (TMC) to check the system. Official sources confirmed that a new printer was installed at the TMC by the evening and printing began around 7 pm.
 
 “A printer was sourced from a private vendor till the two old printers get refilled with ink,” said the source. Contacted, SP (traffic) Anil Jha reiterated that the problem was fixed by the evening and printing had started.
 
 However, readers have raised objections questioning why the challans were pending and suggested that they be shared with the violators via email or on social media instead of printing.
 
 Amit Gupta, a resident of Sector 77, said, “There can be naming and shaming of such defaulters in the gazette. Alternatively, the names of the defaulters can be publicised on the official Twitter handle of Noida   and information can be sent to them without involving paper and ink. The traffic police should not depend on the Noida Authority for small things such as paper and cartridge.”
