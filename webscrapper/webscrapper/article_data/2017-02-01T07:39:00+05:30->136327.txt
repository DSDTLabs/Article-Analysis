CHANDIGARH: The   on Tuesday issued notice to the Haryana chief minister and the   of the state assembly on a plea against the induction of ministers more than the prescribed constitutional limit.

 The Constitution restricts the size of a cabinet to 15% of the house strength. However, the cabinet strength has exceeded the limit of 15% in Haryana with the induction of three ministers Vipul Goyal, Banwari Lal and   in July 2016. BJP’s chief whip and Panchkula MLA Gian Chand Gupta has also been given the rank of a state minister.
 
 A division bench of the HC headed by Justice S S Saron has taken cognizance of the issue after hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Jagmohan Singh Bhatti.
 
 The petitioner in this case has said that the state of Haryana has strength of 90 members in the state legislative assembly.
 
 In view of the 91st amendment of the constitution, which became effective from July 2004, the number of ministers in the state of Haryana could not exceed 13. The mandate of the constitution is equally applicable in all the states of the country and the states are duty bound to obey the constitutional provisions.
 
 He further submitted that the Haryana government has flouted the constitutional amendments by appointing Goyal, Banwari Lal and Grover as ministers and giving the state minister’s rank and status to Gupta, thus taking the total strength of the cabinet beyond 15% prescribed by Constitution.
 
 The petitioner has sought directions for declaring the posts held by them as illegal.
 
 Besides CM and the speaker, the HC also issued a notice to Goyal, Banwari, Gupta, Grover and other respondents. The case would now come up for hearing on February 20.
