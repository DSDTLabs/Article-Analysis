HYDERABAD: The International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI) will showcase the technology it has developed in the last two decades, at an exhibition ­ TechEx 2017 ­ here for two days from February 27.

 The exhibits include antimine shoes for Army and police personnel involved in operations in  . The shoes will protect the personnel in case of a blast. Other products are honeycomb-based energy efficient industrial heaters, and nano-silver and nano-titania for textile coatings for antibacterial and self-cleaning properties. As many as 30 technologies developed in the last 20 years will be on display . The exhibition marks the celebrations of 20 years of ARCI.
 
 ARCI director Dr  , and associate director Dr Roy Johnson told media here on Saturday that TechEx 2017 will provide solution to all those looking for an engineering material-based solution for their products or applications. Union minister of state for science and technology YS Chowdary will be the chief guest. Prof Ashutosh Sharma, secretary of the   , and Dr   , scientific advisor to defence minister, will also participate.
 
 The ARCI's research is fo cused on powder metallurgy , ceramics and surface coatings. “Among the technologies transferred to industry is detonation gun-based thermal spray coatings for wear resistance applications in various industrial systems,“ they said.
 
 The ARCI has capability of synthesizing nanomaterials for application in important areas such as lithium ion batteries, nano-composite coatings, water treatment and energy systems. It has also developed easy-toclean, solar selective, anti-reflective and corrosion resistant coatings.
 
 In the area of clean energy technologies, ARCI's centre for fuel cell technology in Chennai is able to produce fuel cells up to 20 kW by incorporating several in-house materials innovations.
