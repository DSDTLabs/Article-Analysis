 Mukesh Kumar, the Ahmeadabad municipal commissioner, said, “For an efficient transport system, various modes of transport need to be introduced and developed in an integrated manner. 
 
  
  A plan has been developed to create an inter-modal transport hub, to gather and distribute passengers as efficiently as possible by linking outward-bound urban passenger transport facilities such as GSRTC, railways and airport terminals as well as various inner-city transport systems such as the bullet train, Metro, AMTS, BRTS, railway, taxis, and private vehicles.
 
 This hub also has people-oriented amenities (eg. coffee shops, entertainment facilities, shopping stalls, wireless connectivity, restaurants, hotels, speciality stores, parking, and others) to make the travel experience more pleasant. Overall project planning for the hub — site selection, transport planning, core area planning, and ancillary services planning — has been designed and implementation is in progress. 
 
 The government has approved the inter-modal transport hubproject under the Smart City scheme. 
 
 The project cost will be around Rs 125 crore. We expect work to start from April 2018 and be complete in 18 to 20 months.”
 
 “Further, for India's first ever Bullet train project (Ahmedabad-Mumbai) the Sabarmati railway station has been selected as the origin terminal. 
 
 The site for the IMTH at Ranip has been selected based on the location of the railway line, bus lines, the comprehensive development plan of the city, zoning and land use regulations, as well as technological and social factors. For this site, approximately 45,000 square metres has been earmarked by the Government of Gujarat,” he added.
