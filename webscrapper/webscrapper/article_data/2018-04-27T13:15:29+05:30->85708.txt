MOHALI: The private operators have staged a protest outside the demolished bus-stand in Phase VIII in   on Thursday. Some of the residents have also joined the protest against the decision of Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (Gmada) to demolish the old   stand and seize operations. 

 Hundreds of private bus-operators gathered at Phase VIII ground opposite the old bus stand and raised slogans against Gmada. They alleged that the buses have been operating from the old stand since past five decades and before the new bus stand was commissioned, the residents used to board long-route buses from this bus stand.
 
 Some of the bus drivers Jasbir Singh, Dharam Singh, Jarnail Singh, Desa Ram, said that they have been operating from this bus stand from past two to three decades. They said, "The decision of Gmada of not allowing the buses to operate from this bus stand must be reviewed. Else, the administration must arrange for an alternate place inside the city to operate buses."
 
 Jeet Ram, a resident of Phase XI, said, "The decision of the administration to close down the old bus stand is not resident-friendly. We have to spend Rs 60 to Rs 80 to reach Phase VI bus stand from Phase XI, which is impractical. We have to further pay Rs 100 to reach Ludhiana. Boarding bus from Phase VIII was much easier and convenient."
 
 Another resident of Phase X, Urmila Kumari, said, "The administration must have arranged for local transportation before closing down the operations from old bus stand."
 
 Though, animal husbandry minister Balbir Singh Sidhu is firm on his stand to get one local bus stand at the site which has been demolished by Gmada. Sidhu said, "I will talk to the chief minister on the issue. We are to look at the public convenience, not the revenue generation for the local body. One local bus stand is required at Phase VIII."
