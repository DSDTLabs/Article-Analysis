VIJAYAWADA: The freight sector in the state is going through an unprecedented shortage of drivers, with transporters saying there are only 750 drivers available for every 1,000 trucks.

 For decades, Vijayawada has had a   Commodities such as eggs, fish, turmeric, chillies and groundnut are shipped to the north and the northeast from the city. That trade however is now taking a beating due to a lack of drivers.
 
 General secretary of Andhra Pradesh Lorry Owners Association YV Eswar Rao said such a situation has never arisen before. He said there has been an increasing dearth of drivers in the sectors as even uneducated youth are not choosing driving as a career.
 
 Eswar Rao said many youths would migrate from the villages and come to the city in search of work. Many of them took to driving trucks. But ever since the MGNREGS scheme was introduced, migration from villages has come down resulting in lesser drivers joining the workforce.
 
 Besides, app-based cab services such as Ola and Uber have also contributed to the shortage of drivers. Many people are choosing to drive taxis over trucks as they offer better remuneration and working conditions, say industry experts. CII chairman   said a cab driver can earn up to Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000 while a truck driver makes Rs 20,000 to Rs 30,000 at the most in a month.
 
 Prasad also hightlighted another issue plaguing the freight   â€” a lack of skilled workers. He said there is currently a shortage of six million workers in the freight transport sector across the country and with an ever-expanding market, an additional requirement of five million workers in being created every year.
