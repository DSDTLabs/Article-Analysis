NAGPUR: Close on the heels of two leopard deaths three days ago, two more leopards were  , 35km from here, under mysterious circumstances  .

 The death of mother leopard and her   in a farm in Rajna at the backyard of MOIL mines in Gumgaon is shrouded in mystery.
 
 Nagpur deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) G Mallikarjuna said, “It is an unfortunate incident and we probably suspect it to be a case of poisoning, though it would be confirmed only after reports of forensic tests come in.”
 
 According to ACF RS Meshram, the carcass of the mother and cub were found separately in the farm of Raju Umale and Namdeo Bhokre in survey nos. 56 and 58. The incident occurred on Monday and the carcasses were shifted on Tuesday night.
 
 “Both the carcasses lay 100m away from each other in the tur clusters on the farm. Forest is at least 10km away from the spot and there is also no water source or electric lines nearby,” Meshram said.
 
 It is suspected that the carnivores must have   after touching live electric wires. The pictures show blood oozing out from the mouth and foul play is suspected.
 
 Forest officials said the leopards must have died after consuming urea mixed water used for spraying on crop. However, wildlife experts fear the leopards must have been electrocuted elsewhere and the carcasses were dumped in the farm.
 
 Wildlife veterinarian Dr GM Kadu said, “We are investigating all angles to find the root cause. Taxological samples have been taken and will be sent to forensic labs in Pune and Nagpur.”
 
 “Prima facie there were pneumonic symptoms and congestion in the lungs, but poisoning and electrocution angles will also be probed,” Dr Kadu said.
