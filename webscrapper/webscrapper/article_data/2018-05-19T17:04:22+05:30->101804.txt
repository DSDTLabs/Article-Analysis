DUBAI: Seven people in  , including four prominent women's rights activists such as   and   al-Yousef, who campaigned for the right to drive, are being accused by state security of working with "foreign entities.''

 
 Pro-government media outlets have splashed their photos online and on newspapers, accusing them of being traitors. The stunning arrests come before Saudi Arabia is set to lift the world's only ban on women driving next month.
 
 The   late Saturday did not name those arrested, but said the group is being investigated for communicating with "foreign entities'' and providing money to foreign circles with the aim of destabilizing the kingdom.
