BENGALURU: A city civil court on Wednesday sentenced a 29-year-old man to life imprisonment for raping an eight-year-old girl in August last year.  , who was working as a truck driver with MEG in Ulsoor, was arrested on the night of August 13 last year, after the incident came to light. He was handed over to police by the mother of the victim and neighbours. 

 A case was booked under section 376 (rape) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso), 2012. On Wednesday, the court also imposed Rs 3 lakh fine, which will be given as compensation to the victim.
 
  A father of two, including a seven-year-old girl, Kondaiah, had taken the victim on his motorbike on the pretext that her father was having dinner at his residence. There was nobody at home as Kondaiah's wife and children had gone to their native in Andhra Pradesh. 
 
 "After taking the victim home, Kondaiah raped her," the chargesheet, which had recorded statements from 20 witnesses including forensic experts and doctors, read. "By night, Kondaiah brought the girl out and dropped her near her home. Neighbours and other military staff had seen him with the victim," it goes on to state. A senior police officer said, "We are happy to have closed the case in six months, which is usually the time taken to complete the investigation. We had submitted the chargesheet in 50 days. This is one of the quickest trials in the state. Investigation by Ulsoor inspector   and arguments by public prosecutor   helped in the conviction."
