HYDERABAD: Elections to the   (SCCL) being fought by recognized trade unions affiliated to various political parties are being viewed as an indicator of the hold of ruling   in 12 assembly constituencies located in five districts.

 Slated to be held on October 5, the elections are being termed as the semi-final for the general elections in 2019. Wanting to prove that the people are with it in the 2019 polls, the TRS wants to ensure a thumping victory for Telangana Boggu Ghani Karmika Sangham (TGBKS), the trade union that it is backing. However, rallied against it is the combined opposition of Congress-affiliated Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) and CPI-affiliated   (AITUC).Backing AITUC is the   (TNTUC). In order to sway the employ ees, the TRS had campaigned for implementing the dependent employment scheme by which the kin of an employee declared as medically unfit to work was to be given employment in SCCL. However, it was stayed by the Hyderabad high court and that emerged as a victory for the other trade unions.A lot is at stake for the TGBKS (and the TRS) in the elections as its honorary president is none other than K Kavitha, Nizamabad MP and chief minister  's daughter.
 
 Though there are over 15 trade unions in the region, the main contenders are the TGBKS and the common candidate of the opposition trade unions.
 
 "We have completed one ro und of campaign and are happy with response from the coal mine workers. They are very much upset over mess up of dependent employment and open cast mining," N Uttam Kumar Reddy, TPCC president told TOI.Over 50 TRS MLAs and five MPs are campaigning for TRS.
