MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday sought the names of some   schools so that it can hear their grievances against defective tablets given to its students.

 A bench of Chief Justice   and Justice   heard a PIL which said out of 22,799 tabs provided to schools in the 2015-16 academic year, more than 10,000 are not working. Also, in 2016-17, some 15,000 tabs have been supplied but students are not using them. The court was told by petitioner   that a Rs 50-crore contract was given to the manufacturer to provide them with tablets over a period of three years.
 
 BMC advocate said a tender was issued and the lowest bidder was supposed to supply the tabs. The judges said they “want the commissioner to look into the matter“ and inform the court about it. They warned the manufacturer that if it does not come clean, it will direct publication of a public notice and also set up a committee to look into it. “Then we'll know what kind of tabs are supplied. Right diagnosis. Right treatment,“ said Justice Chellur.
