Shikha Singh, popular as Aaliya in ' ', has filed a complaint against an official from the Regional Transport Office (RTO) for objectifying her on her Instagram account.

 It all began when Shikha recently posted a picture of her with her husband, Karan Shah, on which, the officer commented, ‘Beautiful. Pl upload some hottest poses with bikini or microminis as new year gift’. (sic)
 
 While many followers complimented her on her look and attire, the actress was miffed to read the comment posted by the man. Shikha tells us, “I am not going to take this lying down and will see to it that strict action is initiated against this man. The police has been supportive throughout and they even helped me to trace him to Thane, where he resides.”
 
 Apart from standing up for herself, the actress feels that as a celebrity, it’s her moral responsibility to speak up against such incidents. “We are used to getting hate mails for our screen image, but this amounts to perversion. Many women keep mum about such incidents, but as celebrities, it is our responsibility to not let them go unnoticed. I hope that my step encourages other women to speak up. Just because we are in the glamour industry, people feel that it’s their birthright to objectify us. My fight is not just against this man, but the mindset which is plaguing our society. I appeal to all men and women, who have faced such experiences, to come out in the open, and name and shame the perpetrators.”
