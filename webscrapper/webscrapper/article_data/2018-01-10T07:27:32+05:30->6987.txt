LUCKNOW: Senior   (RSS) leaders on Tuesday came out with the suggestion that the government should develop places of religious importance keeping in mind pilgrims and not the tourists alone. 

 At the coordination meeting with the government's representatives at chief minister Aditya  's official residence, the RSS functionaries suggested that developing places of religious importance keeping in mind pilgrims would help in keeping intact their significance.
 
 Citing an example, an RSS insider said that religious places like Naimisharanya in Sitapur should be developed to encourage pilgrims and ensure facilities for them. Developing them keeping in mind just tourists might make it a tourist place and not a place of religious importance, he said.
 
 From the RSS, senior functionary and joint general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale, RSS-BJP coordinator Dr   and national co-organisation secretary Shiv Prakash among others took part in the coordination meeting.
 
 From UP government, CM Aditya Nath Yogi and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya were present in the meeting.
 
 
 
 
 UP BJP chief Mahendra Nath Pandey and BJP organisation secretary Sunil Bansal were also present at the meeting. The RSS leaders were also of the view that appointing retired teachers in schools to tackle the shortage of teachers cannot be a permanent solution. They suggested that the government should ensure recruitment of JRF, NET qualified youths as a long-term arrangement. This would also to an extent help solve the problem of unemployment in the state, the RSS insider said and added that many youths were are JRF or NET qualified are wandering in search of good jobs. The RSS functionaries also expressed their reservation against UP government special focus on English medium schools.
