The successful producer at Shemaroo,  , is a name to be reckoned with. With his acumen,   has not just stayed in the movie business and has been successful, but has also been very relevant as content creators. Talking about some of the recent achievements and future plans, Ketan says, "I am concentrating on digital platforms, we have 75 Youtube channels focus is less on film acquisition. Our last film was Hunter. We believed in the film and it was appreciated and is considered a cult film. I intend to produce more films this year, I have full faith and confidence in this film 'Mirza Juuliet'. Realistic cinema is our forte and we believe in quality content. I believe that content is the king."

 About the current business scenario in the film industry, Ketan does think that there needs to be changes in the way the film business works so that good content can thrive. He says, "Film making has become totally star driven, talent is not getting enough opportunity to prove. The business module has changed, multiplex boom came and everyone thought small films will get released properly but multiplexes are not giving trailers of even small films. Producers association is also sleeping, lot of changes are needed in the industry and collective and firm efforts are needed."
 
 Ketan, a big movie buff who makes sure he watches at least one film a day, says that ' ' and ' ' were the two films he thought were strong, content driven projects. 
 
 His business philosophies, like all successful ones, is simple. He says, "We have been in business of entertainment since 52 years and our objective is to make Indian content reach to unreachable audience."
 Well, we wish you luck in all your endeavours, Ketan!
