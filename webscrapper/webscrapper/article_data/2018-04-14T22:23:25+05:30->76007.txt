INDORE: The ‘matrimonial advertisement’ posted on   for Geeta has attracted a flood of responses from across the country, with match seekers asking about her food preferences, religion and even nationality.

 “During the day, we received as many as 12 video calls from several states. The maximum were from  , followed by Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal. The candidates showed their interest to marry Geeta,” sign language expert Gyanendra   said.
 
 Purohit, who helped Geeta as interpreter in India when she was in Pakistan, had posted the advertisement on his Facebook account on Thursday, seeking ‘smart, deaf boy above 25 years of age for India’s daughter Geeta’. He received a flurry of queries: what if Geeta has to return to Pakistan; what’s her religion; and is she non-vegetarian as she spent around 14-years in Pakistan?
 
 “Geeta had informed me that she is a Hindu by religion and her food preference is vegetarian. So I posted these answer to their queries,” Purohit said.
 
 Three ‘candidates’ have already sent their biodata, he added. These have been forwarded to the ministry of external affairs since minister   will take the decision regarding the Pakistan-returned girl’s marriage and, of course, Geeta has the final say, said Purohit.
 
 ‘Overwhelming’ response to ad
 
 Purohit said, “Geeta will be shown the biodata after consent is received from the authorities.” He is thrilled at the ‘overwhelming’ response to the ad. “We have also circulated the ad on WhatsApp groups of deaf-and-mute users as it is a means of getting faster results” Purohit said, adding that the ultimate aim is to find Geeta’s biological parents. “The last few years of search for Geeta’s parents have proved futile.   ji once told me that Geeta wants to marry and a search for her parents can be continued after the wedding,” Purohit said.
