MUMBAI: A day after widespread malfunctioning was reported in VVPATs used for the Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha bypoll, the   shifted Gondia’s collector   for dereliction of duty. 

 Chief electoral officer Ashwini   said on the instructions of the EC, Kale has been relieved with immediate effect and charge entrusted to the   chief executive officer, Kadambari Bhagat-Balkawade, who will oversee repolling on Wednesday in 49 booths across the constituency, 18 in Bhandara and 31 in   district. 
 
  
  
 “Re-polling will be held on Wednesday while counting will take place as scheduled on May 1,” Kumar said. Apart from complaints about VVPAT (voter verifiable paper audit trail) systems, Kale was accused by state NCP chief   of blatant violation of the code of conduct. In a complaint to the EC, Patil said despite the code of conduct being in force, Kale had released Rs 11 crore to aggrieved paddy growers on May 25, a few days before the polling. 
 
 Government had on December 22 declared compensation to paddy growers, whose crop was damaged; Rs 11 crore was meant for disbursal to farmers in Gondia and Bhandara. “Compensation was announced in December and it is being paid in May on the eve of the by-election. It’s a clear case of violation in favour of the ruling party,’’ NCP said in its complaint. 
 
 However, a senior official defended Kale saying the payment was released on instructions by divisional commissioner Anup Kumar. “During avideo conference with collectors, the commissioner had asked them to release the compensation,” he said.
