 It was around 2 am on Jan 1 and I was walking down MG Road with three friends when we saw a crowd running towards Brigade Road from Church Street. Police had resorted to lathicharge to control an unruly mob on Church Street and the mob was running away from them. We decided to move out of the street to a corner near Blossoms cafe, when one of the men from the crowd suddenly groped me from behind. He held me for a couple of seconds and my mind just went blank for a couple of seconds. I was shell-shocked and could not fathom what was happening. I looked at the man’s face and felt a wave of disgust and I pushed him away. He joined the crowd and ran away from there.
 
 I was wearing a pajama and a hoodie. There goes the logic that only women with revealing clothes were groped. Thanks to my friends, who surrounded me to protect me, we reached Trinity Circle from where we took a cab to Ulsoor.
 
 It wasn’t my first time in Bengaluru. And I know the city quite well. There was no reason for me to stay at home when I wanted to go out on New Year’s Eve. I was travelling from Kerala for work and decided to spend the weekend in Bengaluru where I have a few friends. Not a fan of pubbing, but someone who would not mind a stroll to see a celebration, I went out with my friends, three of whom were boys. I never thought that something of this sort will happen in a city like Bengaluru which is considered safer than other metros.
 
 The crowd that attacked the women that night did not have the kind of men who you usually see in Bangalore pubs. It looked more of an organised act that was planned by the people. I am back in Kerala and do not think that filing an FIR makes sense for me. I do remember the face of the person, but there is no way I can track him down. But I urge the women who were molested that night to come forward and file FIRs. It will make the job of police easier too.
