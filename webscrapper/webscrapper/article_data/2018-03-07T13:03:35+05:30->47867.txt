GUNTUR: Chaos is prevailing in the   supplies wing at   ( ) with not a single senior official reportedly looking into the complaints regarding poor water quality in the city that are being lodged on a frequent basis.

 The outbreak of diarrhoea in   area had thoroughly exposed the situation prevailing in the GMC, said sources. Allegations are rife that a majority of the officials in the engineering wing are only bothered about making a quick buck through nomination works and are not at all concerned about addressing complaints.
 
 According to official sources, water quality testing has been completely left to the low cadre staff like fitters and tap inspectors. Officials say there are not enough fitters and tap inspectors to handle the workload. 
 
 The drinking water quality in a city with a population of 8 lakh is being managed by just eight fitters, which means that each fitter has to ensure water quality for about a lakh population. 
 
 “Each fitter and tap inspector has been made to look after 8-10 divisions making it impossible to effectively handle work,” said an engineering official.
 
 Sources said the engineering wing is reportedly taking up almost all the repairs to the water supply lines on a nomination basis and is pocketing huge amounts. Sources said the GMC is spending close to Rs 5-10 crore on nomination works annually which the assistant engineers refer as emergency contingency works.
