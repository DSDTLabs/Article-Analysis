Playing a UPite in the popular show Bhabi Ji Ghar Par Hai!,   Atre aka  , says people mistake her for a UPite now. And with election season on in the state, the actor claims she has been invited by several political parties to canvass for them.
 
  “I have been getting calls from representatives of various political parties from the state, who are offering me a decent amount of money to come and campaign for them in Lucknow and other cities in UP. While I have a decent idea about politics, especially politics of UP, I can’t campaign for just anyone.
  
  I don’t want to be the face of any political party in UP elections. I need to thoroughly research which party is good, only then can I support them,” says Shubhangi, who was in Lucknow recently. She adds, “People are probably calling me because my show is based in Kanpur, so they might be thinking that I can influence voters or that I have some UP connection.”
