MUNGER: Two members of a   family died under mysterious circumstances at Rahmatpur Basa village under Asarganj police station, 54km from here, on Friday.

 Tarapur SDPO T N Bishwas, circle inspector  , circle officer   and SHO of Asarganj police station  , who rushed to the village late on Friday evening, said the duo –   (45) and Sugia Devi (40) – died due to illness. 
 
 Though some locals alleged that the duo died after consuming spurious liquor, the SDPO denied it. “Sugia’s husband Natoo Manjhi told us that the two had not consumed liquor. Prima facie, it seems the duo died of illness,” the SDPO added.
 
 As the financial condition of the family of the deceased is very poor, the officers contributed for the last rites of the duo. “It is surprising that the mukhiya and panchayat members did not include their names on the BPL list which could have made the families eligible for government benefits,” said an official.
 
 Munger SP Ashish Bharti said police were trying to identify those who spread rumours that the duo had died after consuming spurious liquor.
