Thiruvananthapuram:  , one of the most congested junctions in the district will soon get a makeover under the ongoing Kazhakkoottam-Adoor safe corridor project. Ahead of implementing the project, the encroachers would be given time to shift to another area.

 A meeting chaired by MLA D K Murali at Venjaramoodu on Monday to discuss the junction improvement under the Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP) took the decision in this regard. Called by community liaison officer of KSTP, the meeting was also attended by the district collector, representatives of all major political parties and Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti. 
 
 Murali said that most of the traders agreed to the suggestions made at the meeting. “Around 45 traders were found to have encroached the junction. All were given time till June 10 to clear their doubts related to the project. They could voluntarily shift until June 30. After that the encroachments will be cleared,” he said.
 
 “This is not just a project for Venjaramoodu junction alone. Around 25 junctions from Kazhakkoottam to Adoor will be improved under the safe corridor project. The proposed ring road project at Venjaramoodu is progressing. There is also another project to construct a bypass from Thycaud to Block Office Junction,” he said.
 
 Though there was also a discussion on shifting the bus stand, no decision was taken on it. The bus stand, with its entrance and exit leading to the main road, is one of the major reasons for the congestion there. Buses entering and exiting the stand often create traffic blocks in the area.
 
 Various road safety measures, suggested by National Transport, Planning and Research Centre, will be incorporated in the road construction.
 
 Land acquisition is progressing for the Rs32-crore ring road project. A meeting of landowners who oppose the project too was held. Under the KIIFB-funded project, the landowners should hand over land for free for  .
