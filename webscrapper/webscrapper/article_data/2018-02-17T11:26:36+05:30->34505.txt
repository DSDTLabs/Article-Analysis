INDORE:   of four districts will now be allotted through e-tender since excise department has failed to secure 70 per cent revenue through renewal and lottery system for the fiscal year 2018-19. 

 There are three process- renewal, lottery and e-tender- for allotting licence of liquor shops for a financial year. As per the current liquor policy, every district needs to secure at least 70 per cent of the revenue through first two processes but Bhind,  ,   and Singrauli districts have failed to do so. Therefore, all the liquor shops of these districts will be allotted through e-tender process.
 
 Indore district somehow managed to achieve the target. “Out of 64 groups of 106 country-made liquor shops and 67 foreign liquor shops, the local excise office has managed to renew 37 groups, while licence for nine groups have been allotted through lottery system. It helped in securing around 72 per cent of revenue for the next financial year,” the assistant excise commissioner   told TOI.
 
 He added that e-tenders will be invited to allot licence for the remaining shops of 18 groups. “With a hike of 15 per cent in current year revenue collection of Rs 684 crore, the state government has set a target of Rs 787 crore for 2018-19. Of this, the local office has managed to secure Rs 565 crore through renewal and lottery process. We are hopeful to easily achieve the target by allotting the remaining shops through e-tender process in days to come,” Choubey said.
