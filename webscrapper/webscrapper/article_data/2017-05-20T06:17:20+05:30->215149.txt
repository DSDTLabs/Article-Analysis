NAGPUR: Prashant Pawar of Jai Jawan Jai Kishan organization has demanded large number of changes in the  .

 He met Dipak Mhaisekar, chairman of   ( ), in this regard on Thursday. Pawar claimed in a press conference that Mhaisekar had agreed to make necessary changes in the plan.
 
 Addressing the media, Pawar also demanded action against Sujata Kadu, NIT’s deputy director of town planning (DDTP), for allegedly sanctioning a mining zone even though she is not empowered to do so. “The change of land use from agriculture to mining can only be done by the urban development ministry. It cannot be done at NIT level. We brought this fact to Mhaisekar’s notice,” he said.
 
 Pawar said he had brought several issues to Mhaisekar’s knowledge. “Some 10,000 houses in around 500 layouts are getting affected due to the proposed road shifting. About 10 lakh plots in the   region do not have sanction and a solution needs to be found,” he said.
 
 “As the NIT has proposed that the gaothan limits be extended by 750 metre, about 40% area of the metro region will become residential. Under such circumstances, there is no need for R1, R2, R3 and R4 zoning in rest of the land,” he added.
