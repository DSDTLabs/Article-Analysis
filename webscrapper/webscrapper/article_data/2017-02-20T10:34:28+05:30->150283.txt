BHOPAL: The state capital has been chosen as one among the eight major cities to have vendors of   across the country from where   can purchase   books for academic session 2017-18.

 In its latest circular, the board informed the schools that NCERT has made available eight vendors across India, which includes Bhopal, Ahmedabad, Ajmer, New Delhi NCERT headquarters, Bhubaneswar, Kolkata, Mysore and Shillong for purchasing books. The circular further states that there will be 680 empanelled distribution vendors of NCERT across the country who will produce books in bulk and adequate numbers. “NCERT will be printing and supplying adequate quantity of books for all the classes. The books will be made available with the vendors in Bhopal, Ahmedabad, Shillong, New Delhi, Bhubaneswar, Kolkata, Ajmer and Mysore,” reads the circular issued to CBSE affiliated schools in Bhopal. The information came after the CBSE asked all schools affiliated to it to use only NCERT books from the academic session 2017-18.
 
 The decision to use only NCERT books in CBSE schools has been taken after recent reports of an eccentric experiment surfaced in news in which a Class IV textbook asked students to suffocate a cat to death to understand the difference between living and non-living things. As per reports, the book, which is part of the curriculum of a Delhi school, states, “Living things need air to breathe and non-living things can live without air for a few minutes.” It then asked the students to put two cats in two different boxes for the experiment. The CBSE has now asked all its schools to follow only NCERT curriculum, both for textbooks and workbooks. A link has also been created on the CBSE website where schools can fill up their demand for books. A review meeting was held recently with senior officials in the   and it was decided that all schools should follow   so as to lend uniformity to the syllabus taught in schools.
