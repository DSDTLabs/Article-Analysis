Chandigarh: Miscreants torched five auto-rickshaws, a motorcycle and three rehris in Tin Colony, Sector 52, on Wednesday.

 Police said the accused set on fire three auto-rickshaws and the motorcycle at 12.43 am, while the rest of the vehicles were burnt at 6am. Colony residents along with local councillor Pappu Shukla alleged some criminal elements staying in the colony have resorted to this act to create fear among people.
 
 Shukla, who sat on protest against the Chandigarh police on Wednesday morning, alleged these youngsters have made the life of residents hell and carried out illegal operations without any fear of law. “They sell and buy drugs openly and terrorise residents who raise their voice against them,” Shukla said.
 
 Shukla said, “I personally met the SSP six times in the last one year and complained about these people doing illegal business openly, but the cops never bothered to take any action.”
 
 Numerous complaints had also been given to DSP (south), Sector 36 station house officer (SHO) and Sector 61 police post in-charge but no action taken.
 
 Police registered a case under Section 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage) of the IPC at the Sector 36 police station.
 
 Sub-inspector Om Prakash, the investigating officer, said, “We are checking the footage from CCTV cameras.”
