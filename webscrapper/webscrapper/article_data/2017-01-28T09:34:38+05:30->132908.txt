KANPUR:   sitting MLA from Etawah (Sadar) Assembly seat   and hundreds of his supporters resigned from the primary membership of the party.

 Shakya and his supporters sent their resignation to the party high command, including chief minister  , who is national president and Naresh Chandra Uttam, state president of the party. 
 
 Of the three sitting MLAs in Etawah, the names of Raghuraj Singh Shakya from Sadar and Sukhdevi Verma from Bharthana (Reserved) seat, who are considered to be loyalists of Mulayam Singh Yadav and his brother Shivpal Singh Yadav, were missing from the list of SP candidates declared recently.
 
 Talking to TOI, Shakya said, “My being MLA is worth nothing if Mulayam Singh Yadav is humiliated. I have resigned not for the ticket, neither I am going to join any other party as ‘Samajwad’ is in my blood but sacrifice it for ‘Netaji’. It is better to resign from the party under the present circumstances.”
 
 He was upset as the party had given ticket to nagar palika parishad chairman Kuldeep Gupta alais Santu, who is considered to be a close confidante of Rajya Sabha MP Ram Gopal Yadav. 
 
 His supporters said that Kuldeep had rebelled against SP candidate during nagar palika parishad chairman elections and fought as an Independent candidate and won, about two-and-a-half year ago. Shakya hails from Dhaulpur Kheda in Jaswantnagar, which is also the assembly constituency of Shivpal Yadav. Shakya had twice won Etawah Lok Sabha seat and in 2012 Assembly elections, he won Etawah Sadar seat by defeating Mahendra Singh Rajput of BSP.
