AHMEDABAD: Even though the deadline for submission of report by the special investigation team probing the self-immolation of   activist, Bhanu Vankar, 65, in Patan has been extended to May 31, sources say that based upon circumstances of the case the SIT will likely give a clean chit to the local administration. 

 Sources say that the SIT believes that it was not possible for the local administration to prevent the incident from taking place as Vankar, a retired talati from Mehsana, became untraceable from three days prior to the incident, and surfaced only to set himself ablaze at the Patan collector office on February 22. 
 
 SIT sources defending the local administration said the men posted in the collector office tried to extinguish the flames with fire extinguisher but in just 40 seconds Vankar sustained 80% burn injuries. Vankar later died in a private hospital in Ahmedabad.
 
 Vankar had been fighting to regularize the land for a Dalit family at Dudkha village of   in Patan district. He had submitted his first memorandum to the district collector on February 7 asking him to speed up the regularization and warned that he would immolate himself if authorities didn't act.
 
 "However, three days before the incident Vankar had gone underground. The local police had even sent a team to   in   but could not trace him," said a government official.
 
 According to government sources, three people came in an auto to the main gate of Patan collector office on the day of the incident. "The cops deployed in bandobast took them into custody, but Vankar along with another man came in another auto and got down at the gate of adjoining   office," said an investigator.
 
 He added, "They entered the Jilla Panchayat building and through a small gate they entered the collector office campus. Vankar who had already doused himself in kerosene set him ablaze taking everybody by surprise."
