NAGPUR: Members of the NGO  , India (ERCS) on Sunday conducted an anti-net and snare removal drive in farms situated around the  .

 Many farmers of the region use worn-out fishing nets as fence to protect their agricultural fields. But every year, a large number of birds die after getting trapped in such nets.
 
 To create awareness on the issue, ERCS members, along with forest officials, removed a kilometre-long net from the farm of Hasan Jhiria. “The farm, which was a few metres away from the reserve, was surrounded by fishing net. While removing it, we found remains of many dead birds trapped in the insides of the net,” said Parag Dandge of ERCS.
 
 Fishing is a common practice in many dams of the region, especially in east Vidarbha. After getting worn out, the fishing nets are sold to farmers for Rs 80-100. “These nets are made of fine threads and are not visible to birds. This leads to the death of a large number of migratory as well as native birds,” Dandge said.
 
 He added that in many cases, scheduled bird species have been found dead.
 
 Two months ago, over 60 birds died after being trapped in a fishing net at Nagbhid forest range. Five huge nets were spread on the banks of a river and nearby fields in Bikli village. In June last year, 20 birds died near Gosikhurd dam in a fishing net trap that was laid on a peepal tree. Among them were eight-ten juvenile coppersmith barbet, golden oriole, black hooded oriole, spotted owlet, myna, cuckoos, sparrows and other species.
 
 Locals had suspected that the net was deliberately laid to poach birds for meat consumption.
