NEW DELHI: Goods and Services   ( ) collections were estimated at Rs 94,000 crore in April, higher than their monthly average but lower than the Rs 1 lakh crore mopped up in March.

 
 While the collections are lower than the informal target of Rs 1 lakh crore a month, the government is drawing comfort from what it believes is an improvement in compliance. “The total   for May 2018 (for sales in April) is Rs 94,016 crore, which is higher compared to average monthly collection of Rs 89,885 crore of 2017-18. This reflects better compliance after introduction of e-way bills,” finance secretary   tweeted. 
 
 
  
 
 “As per the experience of last 5 years, the average collection of taxes on goods and services during April is approx 7.1% of the annual taxes as against 11% for March. April is traditionally the month of lowest monthly collection. Going by this past experience of indirect taxes and the robust trend in GDP Growth, the April collection of GST indicates a very promising future for indirect tax revenue,” Adhia said.
 
 Pratik Jain, who leads the indirect tax practice at PwC India said the government can hope for monthly collections of Rs 1 lakh crore soon. With e-way bills, which are electronically generated numbers to track consignments, scheduled to be mandatory for all shipments of over Rs 50,000 from Sunday are expected to help boost numbers further. Currently, all goods for inter-state movement above the threshold need e-way. While most states have moved to e-way bills for intra-state movement, only a handful are left.
 
 “Introduction of e-way bills could be one possible reason for the increased revenue collection... With introduction of other anti-evasion measures like intra-state credit matching, e-way bills, TDS/TCS, etc, these collections should further increase,” said Abhishek Jain, partner at EY.
 
 Up to May 31, the number of returns filed for April was 62.5 lakh, as against 60.5 lakh for March, which also pointed to improved compliance.
