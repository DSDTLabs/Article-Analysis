PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Municipal commissioner Shravan   would present the   budget for the next financial year to  , the chairperson of the civic body’s standing committee, on   15.

 Rajesh Lande, the chief accounts officer of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), said, “The accounts department has started the preparations for the draft budget. It will be presented to the standing committee before February 20. We have instructed the heads of departments to give information about the ongoing projects requiring budgetary allocation in the 2018-19 fiscal.”
 
 Former civic chief Dinesh Waghmare had presented the draft   for 2017-18 to the standing committee, chaired by Savale, on April 18, 2017. It was approved a week later.
 
 Lande said, “There will be a natural increase of 7.5% in the GST grants allocation from the state government to the civic body. Also, the income of the building permission and town planning departments has increased. So, the annual outlay of the draft budget of 2018-19 is likely to increase by around 5 to 10% than the previous fiscal. But the final outlay of the budget will be decided by the civic chief and the general body.”
 
 He said, “This time, we have asked the civic officials to prepare a priority list of projects for which they want budgetary allocation and want to implement in the new fiscal. It will enable us to allocate the necessary funds and ensure their timely completion. As a result, the number of projects included in the budget will be less but the percentage of projects actually implemented will improve. Corporators are likely to be hurt by this decision but we hope it will improve the functioning of the civic body.”
