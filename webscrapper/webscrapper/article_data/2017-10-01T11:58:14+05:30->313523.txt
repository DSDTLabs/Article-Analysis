MOHALI:   from across the globe who are currently attending the 12th Global Youth Peace Festival had a fun-filled and educative day at   (ISB), Mohali on Saturday. Not only did they get an opportunity to deliberate together on the themes of global citizenship, entrepreneurship, volunteering for peace, sustainable thinking and   but also prepared an action plan which they can implement back home in their communities. 

 The day began with the young people converging at the campus in the morning. Facilitators from ISB as well as Yuvsatta, the organizers of annual Global Youth  , got the young delegates to put on their thinking caps by asking them to deliberate on the themes in groups, share their experiences and insights and discuss opportunities and challenges both at the global as well as local level. 
 
 The event turned out to be a platform for some delegates to have new experience. For Subrat from Nepal, he had met his counterparts from a different country for the first time. Coming from Nepal, he said he has never been to any city before except Patna, the capital of Bihar. “I feel that challenges to peace and development are common to people across the world.” 
 
 For the large contingent of delegates from Malaysia, it was an opportunity to talk about youth-led programme in their country. Miss Mongolia Bayartsetseg who reached late last evening, shared her experience of promoting sustainability thinking and action to the larger group. 
 
 Following the discussions, the young delegates went ahead to enjoy the photography exhibition at the venue. Comprising three photos each from the participating countries, the 75 photos paid tribute to peace and  . There were also some live painting sessions organised for the delegates.
 
 In the evening there was ‘One World Fashion Show’, where the participating delegates dressed in their best cultural attire giving a message of peace and diversity and being part of a large global family.
