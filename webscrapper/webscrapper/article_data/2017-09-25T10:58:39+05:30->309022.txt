GURUGRAM: On Sunday, around 55.68% people voted in Gurugram to elect their next municipal mayor. Last time, i.e. in 2011, the poll percentage was 63.3%. This shows a decline of eight per cent. Notably, the mayor's seat is reserved for a scheduled caste female candidate.
 
 Haryana's ruling party BJP won 14 of 35 seats, falling well short of the halfway mark (18). The BJP must now bank on Independents, who put up a strong show and coasted to victory in 20 wards, to cobble up numbers it needs to put its own candidate in the mayor's chair.
