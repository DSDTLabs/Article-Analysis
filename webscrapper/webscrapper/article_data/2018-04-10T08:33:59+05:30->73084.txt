BENGALURU: The   high command has reportedly cleared the names of a majority of incumbent MLAs and at least a dozen Congress leaders’ kin for the May 12 assembly polls.

 On Monday, the party’s central election committee held a meeting in New Delhi, where state party leaders, including chief minister Siddaramaiah and KPCC president G Parameshwara were present.
 
 A senior leader who participated in the meeting said the first list of about 70-80 candidates, comprising names of party biggies, would be released on Tuesday.
 
 Though the party is most likely to field almost all sitting MLAs, sources said they may leave out 5-6 MLAs, including B B Chimmankatti (Badami), S Jayanna (Kollegal) and Manohar Tahsildar (Hangal). “This was not because of the anti-incumbency factor but due to age and other issues. Some leaders also felt that giving tickets to all sitting MLAs will also check rebellion,” they added. The screening committee reportedly decided to keep the party’s dynasty politics intact. “As many as 10-15 candidates who are related Congress leaders are likely to get tickets,” said a party functionary.
 
 The aspirants include sons, brothers and in-laws. Some prominent names are chief minister Siddaramaiah’s son Yathindra, H C Mahadevappa’s son Sunil Bose and Shamanur Shivshankarappa’s son S S Mallikarjuna.
 
 The meeting also deliberated on fielding candidates for tricky constituencies, including Shanthinagar, Bidar, C V Raman Nagar and Jayanagar.
