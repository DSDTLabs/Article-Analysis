GANDHINAGAR:   published the notification for elections of four Gujarat   seats on Friday. The election process will start from March 5 and the elections will be held on March 23. All four seats going to polls are currently represented by BJP, but given the number of seats the party currently holds in the  , it is possibly set to lose two of the four seats, unless cross-voting happens in big numbers.

 The high-voltage drama that took place during Ahmed Patel’s election to Rajya Sabha proved that mass defections continue to be a painful reality, and also that all calculations can go awry, even with defection of desired numbers. With Patel’s dramatic win in their recent track record, the Congress is readying to snatch another two Rajya Sabha seats from BJP.
 
 The Parliament Bulletin of January 1 shows that the four Gujarat Rajya Sabha MPs who are set to retire on April 2, 2018 are Arun Jaitley (Union finance minister), Mansukh Mandaviya (MoS, road transport & highways, shipping, chemical and fertilizer), Parshottam Rupala (MoS, Panchayati Raj, agriculture and farmer’s welfare) and Shankar Vegad.
 
 For BJP the key challenge will be to retain the two seats that seem all set to be grabbed by Congress. BJP’s MLA count has now reduced to below 100 and Congress seats jumped from 43 to 77 in the 2017 Gujarat assembly elections. Congress has drawn support of three non-BJP MLAs and one independent MLA to take their tally to 81, while BJP has got the support of one independent MLA to take their tally to 100 MLAs.
