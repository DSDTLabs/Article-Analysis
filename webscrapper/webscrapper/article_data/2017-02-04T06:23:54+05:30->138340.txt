AHMEDABAD:   at   is the tony address of senior IAS , IPS officers and judges of Gujarat. However, none of the 140 residences at this high-end colony bothered to register their domestic helps with the local police station before the November 27 incident. It was only after the daughter of the IPS officer was assaulted that 77 homes provided details of their help to local police.

  Sources said no formal registration of domestic helps at the colony had taken place before the incident. If a citizen fails to register their domestic help, police can book them under IPC Section 188 (Disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant). The punishment is six months imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs 1,000.
 
 When   (GU) police officials were questioned about whether   — the   on February 2 — was registered, they said Patel had arrived only a fortnight ago. 
 
 “After November 27, the details of all 77 helps at the apartments in Samarpan Towers were collected. Sonu was among them and his details were collected,” said a GU police official. The officials however failed to show the registration papers at the police station on Friday.
 
 Officials, who did not want to be identified, said that before November 27, there was no record of helps at the high-profile building. “As a general practice, orderlies at the residence of IPS officers report the new help to the respective police station after which the verification takes place. The practice is the same with IAS officers and judges,” said an official.
 
 When contacted, senior officials said that as Sonu was brought through an agency, some scrutiny had taken place at their end and he had no police record. “There was also gullible trust on the part of the employers,” said a senior official.
