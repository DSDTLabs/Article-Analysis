BATHINDA: The alleged failure of the government to check   from across the   border dominated the proceedings at the Bathinda Circuit House on Thursday when additional chief secretary (taxation) M P Singh and state excise and taxation commissioner V P Singh arrived for a meeting with liquor contractors.

 Both officials were here to get feedback from the contractors before finalizing the excise policy for the 2018-19 fiscal. More than 100 liquor contractors from seven districts of Bathinda and   excise divisions had gathered to express their views and list their grievances.
 
 The ACS (taxation) and the E&T commissioner assured the contractors that their grievances about smuggling would be taken care of and the state government might even consider lowering liquor price to narrow the gap between rates in Haryana and  .
 
 Nearly 1,000 cases of liquor smuggling have been registered in Bathinda, Mansa, Ferozepur and Fazilka in the last 10 months.
 
 Dinesh Kumar, a liquor contractor from   in Bathinda, said, “Most of the contractors in our area face heavy loss due to smuggling of liquor from Haryana. Liquor smuggled from Haryana is sold more than what we sell from vends. With that, the state government also loses revenue. It needs to be taken care of.”
 
 Harish Kumar, a contractor from Bathinda, said smuggling had eaten up all profits and they were incurring huge losses. “If the smuggling continues, the contractors may not be able to get vends in the next fiscal,” he said.
 
 A contractor from Moga alleged that illicit liquor was being sold without any fear. He said, “We are not interested in incurring losses any more by remaining in the liquor trade.”
 
 ACS Singh admitted that liquor smuggling was an issue and hundreds of cases under the Excise Act had been registered in Punjab, especially in the Bathinda area. He said the state government was serious about tackling the menace.
