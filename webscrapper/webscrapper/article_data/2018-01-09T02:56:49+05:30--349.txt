IMPHAL: The   discussed on Monday the affidavit of suspended   police commando   who has claimed that he witnessed a large number of fake encounters carried out in the state between 2003 and 2009.

 The affidavit by Herojit, once considered an encounter specialist, was admitted as a criminal miscellaneous petition case. Justices U U Lalit and Madan Lokur heard the plea that the diaries seized by CBI in 2010, where he gave detailed entries of the operations, be produced in court. The SC then observed that his statements can be recorded by a chief judicial magistrate in Delhi.
 
 After being suspended, Herojit, in January 2016, made a startling revelation that he gunned down reformed militant   inside a pharmacy on BT Road in   after being instructed by a senior officer. Besides Sanjit, Thokchom Rabina Devi, a pregnant woman, also died in the infamous firing that took place on July 23, 2009, triggering widespread protests.
 
 Herojit has claimed he killed Sanjit after being instructed by then ASP (Imphal West) AK Jhaljit Singh. He alleged that the senior cop told him there is no problem in carrying out the encounter as the CM and DGP were in the know. Human rightsâ€™ lawyer Colin Gonsalves has submitted footage in the SC that shows Jhaljit interacting with Herojit and several other cops at the crime scene on July 23, 2009. Nine police personnel, including Herojit, were placed under suspension by the government after the CBI submitted a chargesheet in a trial court in Imphal in 2010.
 
 Executive director of Human Rights Alert (HRA) Babloo Loitongbam said Justices Lalit and Lokur also heard the case relating to 1,528 extra-judicial killings in Manipur on Monday. The SC was not happy with the slow progress in the case, non-compliance of its directives and the absence of SIT members.
