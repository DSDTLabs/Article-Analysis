Barely two weeks before it opens in cinemas, 'Bahubali: The Conclusion' has landed in trouble. Reportedly, several pro-Kannada groups are threatening the release of the SS Rajamouli directorial following actor Sathyaraj’s years-old controversial speech during the Cauvery row. The group has demanded that the actor, who plays Kattappa in the drama, apologise to Kannadigas before the film’s release. 

 When we contacted the film’s producer Shobu Yarlagadda, he said, “Sathyaraj had made those comments almost eight to nine years ago. I don’t think this is a major issue. We are trying to resolve the matter amicably and release the film as planned.”
