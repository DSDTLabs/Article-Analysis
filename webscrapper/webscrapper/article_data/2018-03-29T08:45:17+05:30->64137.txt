MUMBAI: The   (PWD) cut spending on maintenance of state   and bridges for three consecutive years,   has said in its audit. CAG has mentioned that the PWD should not divert budgetary provisions to projects other than what the original provisions were meant for. 

 In 2014-15, the demand for grants for repair and maintenance was Rs 6,665 crore, while Rs 1,745 crore was released. The next year, the demand was for Rs 7,257 crore, while only Rs 1,667 crore was released. In 2016-17, the demand was for Rs 6,441 crore, while Rs 1,454 crore was released, CAG has shown.
 
 CAG's report mentions division-wise fund release for the five years from 2012-13 to 2016-17. The report states that expenditure incurred on repair and maintenance of   during the period was Rs 1,004 crore. "Grants released for execution of annual repair and maintenance were less than grants demanded, and the gap between demand and supply was 25-80%," CAG says.
 
 On the explanation that grants were released region-wise to remove backlogs in backward regions, and hence the demand-release gap, CAG says, "The reply is not tenable as there was a gap between funds demanded and released due to execution of all works in the annual repair programme by the division without considering fund allotment."
 
 CAG has also pointed out irregularities in the awarding of contracts. tnn
