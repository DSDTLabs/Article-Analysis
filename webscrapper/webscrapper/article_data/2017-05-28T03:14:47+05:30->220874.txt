NEW DELHI: The   (EC) on Saturday said that it had never made a “promise” to hold a “no-holds-barred hackathon” when it had announced the EVM hacking challenge. 

 “About a ‘promised no-holds-barred hackathon’, it’s clarified that no such ‘promise’ was ever made or announced by the Commission,” EC said.
 
 Responding to AAP’s charge that it was turning tail on a “promised no-holds-barred hackathon”, the EC specified that participants in the challenge had to adhere to the guidelines laid down by the poll body. 
 
 “EVM Challenge will be conducted within framework of existing administrative safeguards and security protocols,” the EC reiterated. 
 
 The AAP had objected to the “rules and regulations” imposed by the EC in its planned  . The party demanded that its representative be allowed to “tamper” with the EVM motherboard at the challenge. 
 
 The EC maintains that changing internal circuitry of the electronic device is like changing the device itself and turned down AAP’s petition. 
 
 Lashing out at the EC for its unwillingness to hold an open hackathon, the AAP said it will not take part in the commission's challenge to demonstrate that its EVMs can be tampered with. 
 
 The poll panel had invited seven national and 49 state recognised parties for the challenge but so far, the NCP and the CPI-M are the only two contenders to throw their hats into the ring.
 
 In its response to the AAP, the commission said it "does not subscribe to the views expressed in the letter (written by the party) that open hackathon is necessary for safeguarding the election process in the country". It said the claim that it is backing off from a hackathon is "baseless".
