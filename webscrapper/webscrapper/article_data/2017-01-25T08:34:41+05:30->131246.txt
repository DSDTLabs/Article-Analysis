BHOPAL: A total of 20 national and international players in renewable energy sector have submitted their bids for developing the world’s largest solar power plant in Rewa district of Madhya Pradesh.

  (RUMSL), a joint venture of Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECL) and Madhya Pradesh Urja Vikas Nigam (MPUVN), invited bids for developing the project that closed on January 23. The 750-MW park being developed in three segments of 250 MW each, is spread over 1,500 hectares of land in Gurh tehsil of Rewa district and is to cover five villages of Barseta in the district. Once completed, it will generate clean energy, overtaking 648 MW solar power plant at Kamathi in Tamil Nadu, the largest plant in the country so far.
 
 “Now these proposals will be evaluated on several criteria like net worth of the developer who has submitted the bid. For developing one segment i.e. 250 MW, his net worth should be Rs 300 crore or more. Similarly, for those submitting proposals for 500 MW should have a net worth of Rs 500 crore and lastly for those who have submitted bids for developing the entire 750 MW should have a net worth of Rs 750 crore,” principal secretary, new and renewable energy, Manu Shrivastav, told TOI.
 
 “Apart from this the second criteria that was introduced with an objective of keeping the tariff low is that bidders were also asked to submit the tariff at which the auction will start. For fixing the tariff a rule has been framed that those two bidders whose proposed tariff is highest will not be allowed to participate in the auctions. However, there are some relaxations, one of which is that if the difference between the highest tariff and the tariff proposed by any bidder is just 5% then that company will be allowed to participate,” said Shrivastav.
 
 “There is also a sub-rule that if the total number of bidders goes down to just 12 then the rule of minimum tariff will not be applied and all participants will be allowed to participate in auctions for developing the Rewa Ultra Mega Solar Project,” the official said. Official sources said January 30 has been fixed as the date of auction, if the evaluation of the bids is completed before it. In the process, the auctions will begin with the lowest rate that has been provided by the developers while submitting their proposals. The developer bidding the lowest rates in the auction will be given the project.
 
 Of the total 20 developers, four namely SBG Clean Tech, Enel Green Power Renew Power and Rosepetal, have submitted bids for developing the entire project, while two others have submitted proposals for developing 500 MWs. The remaining 14 have submitted proposals for developing one unit, i.e. 250 MW.
