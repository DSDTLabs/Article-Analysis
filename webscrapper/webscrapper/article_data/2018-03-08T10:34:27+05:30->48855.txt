CHANDIGARH: For yet another year, the Class XII   paper in CBSE exams stumped many students.

 While some of the teachers and the students said it was a balanced paper, a number of them called it tricky and difficult. According to them, it was not a scoring paper.
 
 Rose Chanchal, a Class XII student from Government Girls’ Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 20 said, “It was an unexpected paper. There was nothing out of syllabus but the questions were very tricky. The questions were very different than what had come in last few years’ question papers. I had solved so many question papers from previous years.”
 
 Aishwarya Singh, a Class XII student from   in Sector 23 said, “It was a very lengthy paper. I wish I had 10 minutes more to complete it. It was also a bit tough.
 
 “Students were able to complete the paper just in time. Paper had a few straight, easy but a little unexpected questions. Children were worried as they had only one holiday in between for revision but it was compensated with a comparatively easy paper,” Anjali Jayaswal, a teacher.
 
 Shruti Garg, head of the science department and a physics lecturer from   in Sector 40 termed it to be an easy but lengthy paper. “This year, the paper was easier. More weightage was given to numericals although difficulty level was normal. Paper was lengthy as every three-mark question had two parts. Overall the paper was a satisfactory paper,” she said.
 
 Physics teacher  , from Delhi Public School, said it was an easy and well-balanced paper. The Class XII science students will have their chemistry paper next on March 13
