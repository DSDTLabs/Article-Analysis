   Harveer Dabas | TNN  Bijnor: After the highest sugar recovery of 12% in Bijnor, farmers from Colombo in Sri Lanka toured the district on Monday to learn the techniques of sowing sugarcane. During the last one year, farmers from various foreign countries have made several rounds to the city for the same.  The team comprising of Thilina, Gaya Gunatilaly and Rohisha Dadarera met district cane officer O P Singh on Monday. Later, they visited several villages including Balapur, Nainpur, Fatehpur and Sofatpur and interacted with the farmers.  The DCO said that the farmers had come to the city to learn more about sugarcane cultivation using trench method which gives a yield og 80-110 quintal per bigha in the district. This method not only improved sugarcane production but also the recovery. In Bijnor district, there are nine sugar mills of which seven managed to extract over 12.5%.  Talking to TOI, a team member Rohisha, said, “Our country imports around 80% sugar. The cane production in Sri Lanka is not much. We grow sugarcane only in 16,000 hectares. The yield of sugarcane is also not good. We are able to harvest only around 40-50 quintal per bigha. The sugar recovery is only around 9%. We found out that Bijnor is the right place to learn about the production of sugarcane. We met the DCO on Monday and visited several sugarcane fields and learned about methods of sugarcane cultivation. We are satisfied after visiting the fields.”
