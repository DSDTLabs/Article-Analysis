MUMBAI: The BEST witnessed a significant dip in power distribution losses in the island city over the past four years as its power supply division registered a record low of 5% distribution loss in 2017-18. 

 The figures are as per latest reports from the state energy department, sources said. BEST officials said this has happened due to increased vigilance, registering maximum FIRs in power theft cases, stringent action against offenders which created a deterrent and strengthened power distribution network in the island city.
 
 The statistics show that the distribution loss, which was more than 10% around eight years ago, was reduced to 6.53% in 2014-15 and it dropped further to 5.83% the next financial year. This was mainly due to BEST's vigilance team conducting a series of raids in slums and highrises and apprehending several people in power theft cases. It brought down distribution losses to 5.42% in 2016-17 and further dipped to around 5% in 2017-18, sources said.
