KOLKATA:   gets a new platform, which will allow   to   there. It will also enable Metro to extend services beyond Noapara towards  ,   

 On Friday, the platform was inaugurated by railway minister Suresh Prabhu from Darjeeling by remote. 
 
  It will also come in handy if the only platform at Noapara gets blocked for some reason. A few months back, a rake got stuck at the Up platform of Mahanayak Uttam Kumar station for nearly two days. Services would have collapsed had there not been a third platform at Mahanayak Uttam Kumar(Tollygunge). 
 
 "So far, there was only one platform at Noapara. And if this platform was blocked for some reason, then Up trains would have to wait at Dum Dum. With the new platform, even if one platform is blocked, trains can continue to run smoothly. Now, we run 100 services between Noapara and Dumdum at 15-20 minute intervals. Services will be more frequent now. We get nearly 6,000 passengers from Noapara every day. This figure will go up when the number of services increase. Our daily earnings of Rs 65,000 (on an average) will also increase," said Indrani Banerjee, CPRO, Metro Railway.
 
 Apart from Metro general manager M C Chauhan and other officials, MP Sougata Roy was present when the platform was opened. Chauhan has already directed officials to speed up work at Noapara-Dakshineswar and Noapara-Airport stretches.
