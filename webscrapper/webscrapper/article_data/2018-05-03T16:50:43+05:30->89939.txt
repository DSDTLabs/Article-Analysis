NEW DELHI: The capital saw a sudden   on Wednesday evening followed by heavy rain that brought the mercury down by several notches. 

 
 The Safdarjung observatory, considered as the base for weather in the capital, received 13.2mm of rainfall between 5.30pm and 8.30 pm, while several other parts of the capital reported intense showers. Met officials said the rain was caused due to a cyclonic circulation forming over Haryana, which also resulted in the dust storm and is likely to bring more drizzle on Thursday.
