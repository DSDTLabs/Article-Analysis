VASCO: Union minister for   and highways and shipping   came under fire for his involvement in Mormugao Port Trust’s (MPT) proposed redevelopment of berths 8 and 9 and the barge berth, on the eighth and   of the public hearing at   in Vasco.

 Speaking about Gadkari’s role in the projects, Abhijeet Prabhudesai alleged that the minister initiated dredging works without proper permissions. “There is big money involved and a thorough inquiry has to be made to bring to light the hidden truths about MPT’s projects,” he added.
 
 Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha also raised her voice against MPT’s expansion plans. “Authorities are using Goa as a coal corridor. Goa is very small and cannot handle increased coal transportation, either through road or railway,” she said, recalling how, on several occasions, she had found MPT flaunting coal handling and transportation guidelines .
 
 “It is high time we respect the welfare of the people and not just the benefits of companies. MPT has to show people that it can handle coal in an environmental friendly manner. No permission for more expansion be allowed,” Saldanha said.
 
 The public hearing came to an end with a strong consensus against giving MPT permission to carry out increased coal handling, channel dredging and redevelopment of berths.
