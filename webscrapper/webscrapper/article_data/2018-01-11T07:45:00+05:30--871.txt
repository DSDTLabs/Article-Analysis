Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday hailed the Supreme Court’s order to reopen a probe into 186 cases pertaining to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, earlier closed by a special investigation team (SIT).

 President of SAD Sukhbir Badal also called for widening the scope of the new SIT to inquire into the alleged nexus between Congress leaders and investigating agencies. “33 years have been lost. Many witnesses have passed away. Many others have become very old and infirm. We must ensure speedy trials to ensure that those who perpetrated the anti-Sikh genocide do not escape justice,” added Sukhbir.
 
 The SAD president said victims of the 1984 massacre, which had led to butchering of 8,000 Sikhs in Delhi and 40 other cities in the country following the assassination of former prime minister Indira Gandhi, had failed to get justice. He further said he was confident that with the formation of the new SIT many Congress leaders who had allegedly evaded justice for 33 years would be brought to book for leading mobs which massacred Sikhs in Delhi and many other cities in the country.
