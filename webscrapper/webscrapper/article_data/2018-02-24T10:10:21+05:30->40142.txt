PALAKKAD: Two men were arrested and five others taken into custody on Friday following the death of an Adivasi youth who was brutally beaten up by a group of local people in   over an alleged petty crime, yet another instance of mobs dispensing justice on their own, a till-now rare phenomenon in the state. 

   , 27, believed to be mentally unsound but harmless, was thrashed after locals 'caught' him stealing food from a hotel. Worse, some of the onlookers saw nothing amiss in taking selfies as the youth was being beaten up. 
 
 CM   condemned Madhu's killing, terming it "the most uncivilised incident". A police team headed by Thrissur range IG M R   will probe the incident.
