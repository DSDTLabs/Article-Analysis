Actress Rakhi Vijan’s decade old marriage ended in 2010, but she preferred to remain tight-lipped about it. Rakhi, best known as Sweety of 'Hum Paanch’ and currently seen in ' ', was married to  , actress Raveena Tandon’s brother. The actress finally opens up about her separation and talks about why she wants to get married again.

 Rakhi says, “My parents have been looking for a match for me and I am sure that they will find someone really good. Regardless of what people feel about the age-old custom of arranged marriage, I really like it. I want someone with a big heart who will understand me. When you find someone like that, most of the battle is won. It’s been six years since I got a divorce and now there is no reason why I should be bitter about the institution of marriage. In this day and age, you do need a companion with whom you can share your ups and downs.” 
 
 Ask her what led to her break-up with Rajiv after being together for 10 years and she says, “Incompatibility. We had different views and opinions and therefore felt that we could not stay together. But yes, it took me 10 years to break all ties because I was giving it a chance. I always thought things would improve and kept doing my best. In fact, my sister-in-law Raveena (Tandon) was a great friend. I spent more time with her than anyone else in the family. She is a great woman.”
 
 The actress, who is looking forward to tying the knot again, however, is not open to the idea of having kids. She says, “I don’t want to have children. I want to live for myself and my companion if I get married again. I want to travel the world, learn new things and not take up additional responsibilities. It is important now that I enjoy my life and live it to the fullest.”
