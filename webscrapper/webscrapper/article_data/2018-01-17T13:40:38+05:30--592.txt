CHANDIGARH: Panjab University (PU) constituted a seven-member inquiry committee to conduct an inquiry about the cause of fire in girlsâ€™ hostel number 3 two days ago. The decision of setting up a committee was made in a meeting chaired by  , dean of student welfare ( ) PU along with the wardens of the hostel on Monday.

 The committee, which is headed by  , dean of student welfare (women) will prepare a report on the cause of the fire and what actions should be taken to avoid such incidents in future. Sources said during the meeting an issue was raised by the wardens that geysers in the hostel which are over a decade old should be replaced. It was stated that these acted as risk factors for the inmates because they are more liable to short circuit, which in turn can lead towards an untoward fire incident. Another issue which was raised in the meeting was that the solar heater panels which were installed in hostels are not self-sufficient as per the demand of the inmates so there is an immediate need of installing new electricity geysers. Wardens said the number of inmates is increasing in the hostel and the capacity of the solar heater is less. It is decided in the meeting that each hostel warden should prepared an estimate about the number of geysers required in respective hostels and submit the list to the office of dean of student welfare.
 
 It was also decided that the electricity wiring in all hostels of the campus should be changed so that there will be no problem of over loading of electricity. DSW also asked the electrical wing to find out whether drip system can be installed in hostels.   representatives raised an issue that a fire alarm system should be installed in the hostel for the safety of the students.
