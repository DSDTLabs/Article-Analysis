BHOPAL: Navigation on city roads is set to become easier in the state capital.   (BMC) is set to install new signages in Bhopal. First such pole with marked space for advertisement on PPP-mode will come up near along the Airport road.

 “Improvement of road signage in as many as 154 locations across Bhopal has been proposed,” said BMC commissioner Chhavi Bhardwaj on Monday. The first phase of a city-wide project is on a public private partnership mode. 
 
 Private participants have been invited to construct Gantry’s on built, finance, operate, maintain and transfer basis. Traffic markings and signage are essential for ensuring a smooth commute only on major roads in the city. 
 
 First of the new gantries towards better signage in the state capital would come up near the airport on intersection near State Hanger. 
 
 Civic body has allowed for a maximum of 15 feet space on the one side of the gantry to attract private investment for the proposal and in the long term stands to makes additional revenue, said BMC official Prem Shankar Shukla.
 
 Major revenue earner for the civic body has been outdoor advertisement. Urban bodies are awaiting final notification of new ‘hoarding policy’ dubbed Madhya Pradesh outdoor advertisement media rules, 2016. It has been prepared by the department of urban administration and environment development (UAED).
