BENGALURU: If your waiting time for   has gone up, it’s because many drivers have temporarily   in on the polls. These vehicles are being hired for   work and   are   for political party rallies or to ferry workers for outstation events. For drivers, it’s a good opportunity to make a quick buck.

 
 While the polls are a relief for cabbies of app-based aggregators who have been struggling due to reduced earnings, it has resulted in increased waiting time for commuters. There’s another reason for cab owners and drivers enthusiastically getting into poll mode. The election wing of the department of personnel and administrative reforms recently revised rates for hiring private taxis for election duty. In Bengaluru, the maximum rate per day for maxi cabs has increased from Rs 2,953 to Rs 3,400 and minimum from Rs 2,607 to Rs 3,000 The city has 1.56 lakh taxis. S Manjunath, a cabbie, said: “I’ve been ferrying candidates from one place to another for two weeks. They pay Rs 2,800- Rs 3,000 per day for 12 hours. I spend Rs 1,000 for diesel and make Rs 1,800 – Rs 2,000 a day. I could earn only Rs 500-Rs 600 from app-based aggregrators after deducting diesel charges and their commission. I haven’t logged on to the app as campaign duty is more profitable.”
 
 Tanveer Pasha, ex-president, Ola TaxiforSure Uber Drivers and Owners’ Association, alleged: “EC officials are forcibly stopping cabs plying without passengers in Hebbal, Marathahalli and Mehkri Circle and using them for their work. It’s unfair to force them to do election duty.”
