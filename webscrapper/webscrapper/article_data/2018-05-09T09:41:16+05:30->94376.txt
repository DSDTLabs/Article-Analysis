HYDERABAD: All India   (AIMIM) leader and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin   made use of a Persian proverb from 1320 AD while referring to  's indication that he could become Prime Minister in 2019. "Hanuz Dili Door Ast," he said in reply to a tweet about the   president's professed claim that the Congress would emerge as the single largest party in 2019. 

 Shivam Vij, whose Twitter handle is @DilliDurAst, had tweeted the question: "Rahul Gandhi says he'd like to be PM if Congress is the single largest party in 2019. Does Mamata Banerjee agree with the idea? What does KCR think? Doesn't Mayawati want to be PM? Can opposition unity survive Congress ambitions? Does India want RG to be PM?"
 
 Owaisi retweeted it with the reply: "Hanuz Dili Door Ast." This is to mean that it would be a far cry indeed for   Gandhi to reach where he wants to. In the Karnataka elections, the AIMIM leader chose not to field candidates and extended support to the Janata Dal (secular). Owaisi has associated himself with Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao's plan of bringing together various regional parties as an alternative to the BJP and Congress at the Centre.
 
 Owaisi's reply in Hindi is read: " ." The original saying is associated with Sufi saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Oliya. During an interaction with citizens in Bengaluru, Rahul Gandhi, in reply to a question had talked about the possibility of the Congress emerging as the single largest party and also indicating that he could be Prime Minister.
 
 Owaisi's response earned him appreciation for use of the proverb. "Now people will be looking for Hanuz," a person responded to the tweet. One Owais Ahamad said: "This is one of the wittiest replies I have ever come across on Twitter."
