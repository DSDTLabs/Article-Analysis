Pimpri Chinchwad: State cabinet minister Girish Bapat would perform the bhoomipoojan of the first Metro station on Pimpri-Swargate route at Sant Tukaramnagar on Thursday, said Eknath Pawar, the ruling party leader of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC).

 Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL), popularly called MahaMetro, began digging pits for the construction of entry and exit points of the Metro station at Sant Tukaramnagar on January 5. The station would be a two-storied structure having a foot overbridge (FOB) on the first floor. The Metro station would be on the second floor. 
 
 The pedestrians will be able to use the FOB freely to cross the Pune-Mumbai highway. The entry into the Metro station will be restricted to people having Metro tickets.
 
 MahaMetro is constructing two Metro routes â€” Pimpri-Swargate and Vanaz-Ramwadi. It started the construction of Pimpri-Swargate route first around six months ago. The 16.589km route will connect Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.
