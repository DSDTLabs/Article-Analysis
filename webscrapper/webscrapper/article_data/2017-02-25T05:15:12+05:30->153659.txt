VADODARA: Veteran actor  , who often made headlines for his scathing tweets and comments, maintained that he was a common man who just likes to express himself. “I am like anyone else; I have the right to express my opinions and I exercise that right,” he said. Kapoor did not comment on his controversial tweets, instead said as a people of a free country, common men too have the right to their opinion.

 Kapoor was in the city to inaugurate the first edition of Vadodara Literature Festival (VLF) that kicked off on Friday. Kapoor was the chief guest at the event which was attended by mayor Bharat Dangar, educationist Tejal Amin and spiritual leader of Vallabh Youth Organization, Vrajrajkumarji, among others.
 
 Literary enthusiasts thronged the venue to see the legendary actor despite festivities in the city on the occasion of Mahashivratri. Kapoor, who was visiting the city after 35 years, remembered the love and affection of the people when shooting for his film ‘Prem Rog,’ which was released in 1982. 
 
 He talked about his tell-all book, ‘Khullam Khulla: Rishi Kapoor Uncensored’ and had the audience in splits during the 45-minute discussion when he shared funny as well as memorable anecdotes from his life. 
 
 He spoke about how his initial fame with his film ‘Bobby’ (1973) so overwhelmed him that he went into a room and began practising his autograph.
 
 Kapoor in his book gives a detailed account of the trials and pitfalls that he faced during his initial days in the industry. He urged the audience to be open about their thoughts and opinions. Speaking on the occasion, Dangar said books are the staple diet of the mind. 
 
 He hoped this festival will contribute to the literary atmosphere of the city. VLF is being held at   on   until Sunday.
