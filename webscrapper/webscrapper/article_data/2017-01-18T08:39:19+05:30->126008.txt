KOCHI:   authorities are planning to revise the   for the agency for   solid waste from different parts of the city to the waste treatment plant at Kochi. According to the corporation authorities, they have won a legal battle against the contractor who now carries out the work. 

 Though the corporation authorities had tried to introduce new set of norms for awarding transportation work a few months ago, the existing contractor had challenged the move in the court. As per the new norms, only trucks registered after 2008 can be used for transporting waste. Moreover, the corporation authorities had decided to increase the amount to be deposited by the contractor to Rs 7.5 lakh from Rs one lakh. Price of tender forms also hiked to Rs 25,000 from earlier Rs 7,500. An interim order by the court had cancelled these conditions.
 
 Later, the corporation authorities filed appeal against the verdict. During the hearing of the appeal, the corporation authorities could convince the logic behind revising the norms. The counsel argued that if old trucks were used waste would spill over the streets, the counsel had submitted before the court and the deposit amount was hiked to ensure that the contractor had the capacity to repair the vehicles on his own in case of any damages caused to the vehicles during the contract period. The division bench allowed all the pleas by the local body, health standing committee chairperson V K Minimol said.
 
 As of now, Kochi Corporation spends around Rs 30 lakh a month for hiring trucks for transporting   from different parts of the city to the waste treatment plant.
