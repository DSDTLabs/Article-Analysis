CHENNAI: Power plants in the state have been cranked up to meet the 13,600MW demand -- 18% more than last year -- in the state. Though the demand is likely to touch an all time high in summer, power managers are confident that they have enough reserves to crank up if needed. Further, wind power will kick in during summer, which would make the summer a smooth sailing, they say. 

 The present demand has gone up despite several industries in   and other cities in the state not working to full capacity due to demonetisation. The total demand increased this year mostly because of the use of air conditioners due to increasing temperature and humidity. 
 
 On the supply side, Tangedco is able to meet the demand without any power cut in any area. “Our thermal units are working to more or less to full capacity. Nearly 4,000MW was generated by Tangedco thermal units and beyond this we are also getting power from private power companies from outside  ,” said the official. 
 
 The central thermal units are also generating to full capacity.
 
 Out of the two units with 1,000MW capacity each at  , Tangedco is getting around 300MW to 400MW from Unit 2. “Unit 2 has reached a generation capacity of 680MW and nearly half of it will be for Tamil Nadu. This unit will reach its full capacity in a few months,” said Kudankulam Nuclear Power site director R S Sundar. 
 
 Unit 1 has been shutdown for maintenance. “We are working to restart the reactor in Unit 1 as early as possible. e think by early next week, Unit 1 will restart power generation,” said Sundar.
