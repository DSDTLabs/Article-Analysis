PANAJI: The   ( ) has given the go ahead for clubs and academies to field foreign players in youth and kids leagues.

 The AIFF introduced the   two years ago and will allow U-13 players to get a taste of competitive football starting this season. While foreign players were never allowed in youth leagues, the AIFF will make an exception for the U-13 and U-15 leagues.
 
 "Clubs and academies can register a maximum of three foreign players after completing required formalities mentioned in the FIFA regulations on the status and transfer of players in their total quota of 30 players for Under-13 and Under-15 youth leagues," the AIFF said in a circular to all clubs and academies.
 
 The decision Â¬ which comes close on the heels of a proposal to allow clubs register eight foreign players in the I-League has been approved by the AIFF executive committee but, quite expectedly, drew frowns from participating clubs with defending U-15 Youth League champions   scathing in its criticism.
 
 "This is taking Indian football to a new low. I was fuming over the AIFF's decision to increase foreign players in the I-League and now we get to hear that they are allowing foreign players in U-13 and U-15 leagues. Assuming we will have about 30 teams participating in each league, we will have close to 200 U-13 and U-15 foreign players in India!," said Minerva Punjab FC owner Ranjit Bajaj.
 
 Minerva have set the standard in youth leagues and have already contributed 10 players to the India U-17 World Cup.
 
 The AIFF, though, has its own reasons to allow such a move. According to one official, there are many foreign players already training with several academies in India and they should not be denied the chance to play competitive football.
