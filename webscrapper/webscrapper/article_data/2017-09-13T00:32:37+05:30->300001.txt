The India team preparing for next month’s   U-17 World Cup has returned to Goa for their final leg of preparations.
 
  The team along with chief coach Luis Norton de Matos arrived here on Monday and will have their first training session on Wednesday. They are expected to be based here till September 26 when they pack their bags for Delhi, their ‘home’ for the group stage of the tournament.
  
  “We arrived here from Bengaluru and the coach opted to give everyone a day off on Tuesday. The final leg of preparations are crucial and the coach wants to ensure that nothing is left to chance,” a source told TOI
  on Tuesday.
  
  In Goa, coach Matos is expected to give the finishing touches to his squad and also finalise the list of 21 players who will get the nod to represent India at the World Cup. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has already submitted a provisional list of 35 players and need to trim that down to 21, latest by next week. 
  
  The team returns to Goa after several exposure tours in Europe and South America under the newly appointed Portuguese coach, who took over only in March.
  
  After an exposure tour to Portugal, the Indian colts toured Mexico last month where they took part in a four-nation tournament, facing off against Colombia, Chile and the hosts. They suffered back-to-back defeats against Mexico (1-5) and Colombia (0-3). Their final match of the tour, however, brought cheer as India held South American U-17 Championship runners-up Chile to a 1-1 draw.
  
  India have a battle on their hands to qualify from Group A which has the United States, Colombia and Ghana.
