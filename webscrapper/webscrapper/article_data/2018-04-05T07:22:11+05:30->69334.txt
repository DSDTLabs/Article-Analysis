LUCKNOW: Following several protests by its students,   on Wednesday banned protests on the campus.   students, especially those from engineering and basic science courses, have been staging sit-ins and hunger strikes against the university’s decision to close courses mid-way.

 An order issued by department   stated that students of BSc and MSc basic science course have been on a dharna in front of the   on the campus and added that “such type of protests are illegal”.   said several mechanisms are in place in the university to address the grievances of students.
 
 The order advised the protesting students to attend classes, and warned that students would be responsible if their attendance fell short.
 
 Reacting to the order, a student said, “Classes are not held and no one listens to us. This is why we have resorted to stirs. The university introduced the courses without taking recognition and now we have to bear the brunt.”
 
 
 Another student said, “The university has cited students’ shortage as reason for closing the courses. But the real reason is lack of infrastructure and shortage of faculty.’’ For the past two weeks, BBAU students have been protesting against the university’s decision to shut the courses mid-way leaving them in the lurch. “We will continue to protest outside the administrative block till our demands are met,” said a student.
