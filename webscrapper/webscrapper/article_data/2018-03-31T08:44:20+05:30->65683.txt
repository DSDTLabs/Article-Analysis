DHARAMSHALA: A batch of 47 padyatris, who left for the Dalai Lama’s abode at McLeodganj from Chuthangmo in Arunachal Pradesh on March 19, reached this hill town on Friday morning. The group had started its march from Chuthangmo — the place where the Dalai Lama had entered India in 1959, after his escape from   — and made it here just in time to attend the Thank You India event being organized by the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) on Saturday.

 The group includes  , mother of the present chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Pema Khandu. They were received here with traditional scarves and greeted by various heads of the Tibetan NGOs and other dignitaries. The march is being organized by   for Tibetan Cause, India, in collaboration with the people of Tawang and West Kameng district of Arunachal along with the monasteries and NGOs in the region.
 
 Thank You India event, now being held near the residence of the Dalai Lama, was scrapped in Delhi after a circular by the Centre to Indian dignitaries to avoid participating in it in view of the   relations. However, there has been a change of Delhi’s stance on the matter after that. Now, Union culture minister Mahesh Sharma and   general secretary   will be attending this function on March 30.
 
 Also, one of the top RSS leaders, Indresh Kumar met Tibetan prime minister Lobsang Sangay on Wednesday morning. Indresh later told TOI, “I met Lobsang Sangay and home minister of the Tibetan government in  . We discussed various issues, including China.”
 
 Meanwhile, the CTA has refused to divulge the list of dignitaries scheduled to attend its Saturday event.
 
 Asked about the guests invited for this programme, CTA spokesperson Sonam Norbu replied, “It would be known to all once the guests arrive at the event. I can’t disclose the list.”
