Brace for a 12.3%   for state-run buses if recommendations by a committee to revise pay-scales of   workers are implemented. Sources said the panel suggested pay revision for over one lakh workers, which includes drivers and conductors. But unions are unhappy with the proposed revision and have threatened to protest once again.

 An MSRTC official said, “The matter is in court, so workers cannot decide to go on strike. Else, they will face stringent punishment.” 
 
 Maharashtra ST Kamgar Sangathana leader Sandeep Shinde told TOI, “Drivers get a monthly salary of Rs11,045 and the panel report has proposed a revised pay of Rs11,919. This is a small hike and we do not accept it. The salary should be raised to Rs18,000 a month as drivers have to work hard and under strenuous conditions,” he said. Workers, he said, had waited for a favourable decision from the high-level committee but now are compelled to protest against the report. 
 
 MSRTC employees are demanding implementation of the 7th pay commission, said a union activist. 
 
 The fare hikes, if implemented, will be applicable to 18,000 buses, including AC Shivneri buses ferrying passengers up and down between Mumbai and Pune daily. The minimum fare of an ordinary state transport bus, which is Rs6, could go up by a rupee, sources said. The minimum fare for a Shivneri AC bus is Rs16, and there could be a Rs2 hike if the panel recommendations are accepted by the management, sources said.
 
 A senior MSRTC official said, “The unions should resolve the issue amicably and refrain from any protest or mass leave. Last time, passengers faced a lot of hardships due to a strike during  . We do not want any services to be hit during the extended weekend during Republic Day.”
 
 The management plans to speak with union leaders to restrain the workers from going on protest, sources said.
