GANDHINAGAR: Political pundits may call it a “soft Hindutva” move of the Congress. 

 The party on Tuesday welcomed the Supreme Court’s advice to the communities involved to go for an amicable solution to the Ayodhya   issue.
 
  This is also being perceived as the Congress party’s bid to stop BJP from taking credit for any breakthrough in the imbroglio.
 
  president  , soon after the SC observation, said, “The SC has rightly advised the two communities to resolve the Ram Temple issue through talks. As a “Bharat” (compares himself to the younger brother of Lord Ram), I will be most happy if Lord Ram’s temple is rebuilt on his birthplace.” 
 
 “Ram Janmabhoomi is the sanctum sanctorum of our faith. Lord Ram lies in every Indian’s heart. Late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had opened the door of the Lord Ram Temple for the first time. I hope an early solution between the parties concerned and rebuilding of the Ram Temple as soon as possible, according to the wishes of all Indians,” Solanki added.
 
 Shankersinh Vaghela, leader of opposition in the state assembly and senior Congress leader, said, “The issue has been pending in the SC for the past several years. For BJP, this is only an issue to garner votes which is very painful. The doors of the temple were opened and puja was started first by the then Prime Minister Late Rajiv Gandhi but the BJP twisted the issue to woo voters. As per the SC guidance, both the groups must sit together and resolve the issue.’’
