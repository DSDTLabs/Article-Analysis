LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh records the most fatalities in   but the state is yet to take  . It has yet not identified   based on the revised criteria set by the   (MoRTH).

 In December 2015, the ministry had set two parameters to identify black spots. One, if an accident has taken place along a 500-metre stretch for three consecutive years, it should be identified as a black spot. The second rule says if ten or more casualties have occurred at a spot at the same time, it should be a black spot.
 
 Prior to the revised criteria, UP had identified 1,250 black spots out of which the city has 181.
 
 “Rectification of black spots has to be done by the agency that has constructed the road but we are lagging behind,“ said a source in the road safety committee. The government has released Rs 655 lakh this year for rectification of black spots but districts are yet to submit their proposal. None of the districts have even identified black spots based on the revised criteria.
 
 Faulty road engineering and complete lack of knowledge of traffic rules are the two main reasons that led to an increase in the number of deaths in road accidents, said the committee. Though NHAI is rectifying black spots, other agencies are yet to act.
