NAGPUR: Youth Congress activists, led by corporator  , staged demonstrations in front of   (NIT) for over an hour, demanding suspension of Suneeta Aloni, deputy director of town planning (DDTP). 

 They cited a report published in TOI on December 14, 2017, highlighting how Aloni was being protected by NIT in spite of being charge sheeted in 2011.
 
 Shelke submitted a memorandum to NIT chairman Deepak Mhaisekar seeking Aloni’s immediate suspension. Later, he told the media that TOI had provided a copy of the charge sheet to the chairman on December 13. However, no action had been taken so far. “It is clear that Mhaisekar is protecting the corrupt officer,” he said.
 
 The city Youth Congress president wondered how Aloni’s charge sheet had gone missing from NIT records. “Chief minister   belongs to the city, and holds the urban development portfolio. How can the file go missing?” he said.
 
 Aloni was charge sheeted by then chairman   on six counts. The first case pertains to wrong opinion given to NIT regarding release of public utility plots in mouza Jaripatka, which caused financial loss to NIT. Her wrong opinion led to loss of time and money in   case. She also gave wrong opinion in case of Hotel Pride, Nelco Housing Society etc.
