ARA: Chhotak Kushwaha (35), the younger brother of Bhojpur district Hindustan Awami Morcha-S (HAM) president Badak Kushwaha, was shot in broad daylight on Sunday afternoon at Saheb Tola village under Bihiya police station of the district.

 
 The deceased was a property dealer and according to police sources land dispute was the reason behind the murder. Bihiya police station SHO Kunwar Prasad Gupta said the incident happened at about 12.30 pm on Sunday afternoon. On Sunday morning, when Chhotak was busy getting a boundary wall erected around a 13 kattha plot of disputed land, over half-a-dozen miscreants attacked him and shot him, he added.
 
 Though he was rushed to the hospital soon after being shot, he succumbed to injuries he sustained on way.
 
 Meanwhile, Manoj Singh, who was the deceased’s partner, in his statement to the police has named 12 persons who were involved in the murder. FIR may be lodged on Monday against all the named accused, said sources.
 
 HAM (S) national spokesperson Danish Rizwan has condemned the incident and said, “Chhotak always apprehended threat to his life and hence requested the Bhojpur district administration several times to provide him arms license which he was denied.”
