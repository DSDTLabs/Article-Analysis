CHANDIGARH/DELHI: Trying to contain the revolt in AAP’s   unit over national convener Arvind Kejriwal’s apology to  , the party central leadership has called the state leaders and MLAs for a meeting in Delhi on Sunday. 

 Manish Sisodia, who is in charge of the Punjab unit, has sent messages to all 20 party MLAs from Punjab for the meeting at his residence, said sources in Delhi. Kejriwal will also attend it, they added. 
 
 However, most of the MLAs, including leader of opposition  , are likely to stay away. “I am not going to Delhi for the meeting. I can’t say about others, but think most of them will not attend it,” Khaira told TOI. 
 
 Most Punjab leaders are in favour of meeting Kejriwal in Chandigarh. However, Aman Arora, the co-president of the Punjab unit who quit from his post on Friday, said, “The MLAs have received SMSs regarding the 5pm meeting. I am going for the meeting.”
 
 On Saturday, three MLAs — Baljinder Kaur (Talwandi Sabo), Amarjit Singh Sandoa (Ropar) and Kultar Singh Sandhwan (Kotkapura) — met Kejriwal in Delhi. They later said they did not get any satisfactory reply from him on his apology for the drug mafia remarks. 
 
  Earlier in the day, two senior MLAs advocated autonomous functioning of the Punjab unit. Senior advocate and Dhaka MLA H S Phoolka tweeted, “In best interest of Pb, my suggestion to Pb   MLAs — demand autonomy, not a separate party...In Punjab matters, total independence & on national issues, go by national leadership (sic).” Kharar MLA Kanwar Sandhu also tweeted, “Let the national unit and state units function autonomously.”
 
 However, the party’s Ludhiana unit came out in support of Kejriwal, claiming that he had been under tremendous pressure because of various cases filed against him across the country. These cases have affected his ability to perform as chief minister and party convener, it added.
