NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday dismissed the bail plea of   and  , directors of real estate major   and sent them to 14-day judicial custody. 

 T he court's order came after public prosecutor   submitted that   did not need further custodial interrogation of the accused persons. The Chandras, through their counsel  , argued that they would cooperate with investigation and not flee from justice.
 
 Aggarwal later told TOI that his clients will be moving a sessions court shortly. 
 
 The Chandra brothers were booked for cheating buyers as Unitech failed to complete a real estate project in Gurgaon's Sector 70 on time and did not refund the money to buyers.
 
 The Delhi Police had earlier found that in the proposed project, only land filling was done and a few sewerage pits had been constructed, otherwise there were no sign of construction.
 
 The Economic Offence Wing (EOW) said that the Chandra's claimed to have utilised Rs 94 crore of the money Unitech received from all customers and financial institutions. 
 
 In this case, 91 homebuyers, who had paid Rs 35 crores for apartments, never got their flats and approached the court.
 
 The EOW also claimed that about Rs 203 crore was collected from 557 homebuyers and loans from banks. The prosecution asserted that the accused failed to construct the projects and did not utilise the money for the housing project.
 
 It also alleged that the company did not have approvals from the competent authorities and building plans were yet to be sanctioned. The entire amount, except around Rs 10 lakh, supposed to be kept in escrow accounts, was allegedly siphoned off.
