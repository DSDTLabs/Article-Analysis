PATNA/BHGALPUR: In a categorical message to ally   over communal disturbances in Bihar, ruling JD (U) secretary general   on Tuesday asked the allies to exercise restraint or else it might help the opposition tarnish the image of   government.

 Tyagi condemned the Union minister Ashiwni Choubey’s statement that the FIR lodged against his son   for allegedly inciting communal tension in Bhagalpur, was a piece of garbage. 
 
 “Choubey holds a constitutional post and is aware of the laws of the land. If police have lodged an FIR against his son after initial probe, he should either surrender or approach the judiciary to defend himself. It is certainly not a responsible act to call the FIR a piece of garbage,” Tyagi said and added none of the NDA allies should indulge in any action which could give an opportunity to the opposition to raise an accusing finger against the alliance.
 
 Incidentally, RJD leaders have been protesting inside and outside the state legislature to press for the arrest of Shashwat.
 
 Hearing the anticipatory bail petition of Shashwat, meanwhile, Bhagalpur’s officiating district judge Kumud Ranjan Singh on Tuesday called for the case diary. His lawyer Biresh Kumar Mishra pleaded for anticipatory bail to his client, saying the case was a fabricated one. 
 
 Shashwat allegedly led a procession to celebrate the first day of ‘Vikarm Samvat’ on March 17, which led to violence in Muslim- dominated Nathnagar locality of Bhagalpur on March 17.
