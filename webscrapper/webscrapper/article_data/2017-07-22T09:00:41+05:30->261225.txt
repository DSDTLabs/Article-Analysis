COIMBATORE: Wipe easy books, the latest product to hit the environment-friendly market, have reached the city. They allow children to write using sketch pens or liquid-based ink pens and then wipe it clean with a piece of wet cloth. 

 As the books can be wiped clean thousands of times, they are also an affordable option for schools run by governments and NGOs, booksellers here say.
 
 At least three stalls, including a Gandhipuram-based publishing house, have launched a range of handwriting practice books and activity books in different languages, which can be wiped clean. “They are made with synthetic coated sheets,” said the manager of Dream World India, a publishing house on 100 Feet Road. “Any ink, except that of a ball point pen, can be wiped clean. Though we recommend use of sketch pens, students can use ink pens or felt tip pens too and enjoy the same results,” he told TOI.
 
 Good Words India, which has books to help children practice writing Arabic letters, say the wipe easy books are popular at schools and public libraries. “At least five schools in Chennai have bought these books in bulk from us,” said the general manager of the publishing house’s Chennai branch, Asrarul Hasan Omeri. “A child can keep on practising and perfecting handwriting on the same piece of paper by just wiping it with a wet cloth,” he said.
 
 Looks like the books are the latest alternative to electronic slates and digital notebooks, which are often blamed for affecting children’s eyes and ability to develop good handwriting. 
 
 “They are also environment-friendly, as they reduce the need to cut down more trees,” Preetha Manoharan, mother of a six-year-old said.
