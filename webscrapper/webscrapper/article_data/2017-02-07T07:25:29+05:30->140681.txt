There are several mysteries surrounding former J  's hospitalization and her death. And suspense shrouds the election of V K   as the legislature party leader of the AIADMK, said DMK working president MK Stalin on Monday.

 Speaking to reporters at Speaking to reporters at Chennai airport, Stalin said, “I have been repeatedly saying that   was shrouded in mystery. The truth will soon come out in public“. Earlier in the day, at a marriage in former transport minister K N Nehru's family in Trichy , Stalin said Tamil Nadu was being tossed up in turbulent waters. It was left to the DMK to salvage it, he said.
 
 T Malaravan, former mayor of Coimbatore and exMLA of the AIADMK, lashed out at Sasikala and heaped praise on Jayalalithaa's niece Deepa. “People of Tamil Nadu voted for Amma (Jayalalithaa). If Sasikala wants to become a chief minister, she should face the elections and win votes on her own,“ said Malaravan. “This is the first time in the history of Tamil Nadu that a maid servant of a party leader has become a chief minister. This is not just unacceptable but ridiculous,“ said Malaravan who was among the first popular AIADMK faces to join Deepa Peravai.
 
 Malaravan said Sasikala's elevation would strengthen Deepa. “Deepa has said that she would make her political entry on February 24. We have already begun our ground work. She would be touring across the state after that,“ he said.
