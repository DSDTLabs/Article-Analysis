The   that was held on Sunday saw city folk throng   to catch a glimpse of the art, crafts and other goodies that awaited them at the annual art fair. A popular attraction this year was that one of the artists, Arun Kumar Yadav, had turned himself into a live canvas and encouraged passersby to paint on him, which many did with glee. His performance art was an attempt to display the apathy of people in today’s world.
 
  Unlike previous editions, this year, there were several hawkers from other states selling everything from tiaras to jewellery and handbags at the venue.   ensured that there was smooth flow of traffic in and around the area.
  
  Although the santhe was close on the heels of the alleged New Year’s Eve molestation incident, safety wasn’t an issue at the fest as men and  , who made up the estimated 3.5 lakh visitors, celebrated the spirit of art together.
