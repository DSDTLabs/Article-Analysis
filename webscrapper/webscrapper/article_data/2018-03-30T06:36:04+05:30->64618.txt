HASSAN: Former Prime Minister H D   said even though senior national leaders like Chandrababu Naidu and Mamata Banerjee are calling for a united opposition against the NDA he won’t talk about it till the end of the assembly elections. “I’ll speak about it once the results are out,” he added.

 He said here on Thursday that the chief ministers of Andhra and West Bengal and others are calling for an united opposition against the NDA. "They’re saying that if secular forces don’t join hands, it’s impossible to protect the Constitution. But I’ll take a decision on joining the opposition front only after the assembly elections," he said.
 
 "I’m fighting against two national parties. For me, the assembly election is very important," he said. 
 
 Taking a dig at BJP national president Amit Shah, Gowda said arecanut and coconut growers don't need any suggestions. "It won’t help them," he said.
 
 Gowda made it clear that MLC Sandesh Nagaraj won’t quit the party. "I spoke to him this morning and he’ll stay in the party," he said.
 
 “On the Cauvery water crisis, MPs from Tamil Nadu have started an agitation. An MP is threatening suicide if justice is not ensured for his state. The dispute should be resolved amicably. It’s not right to obstruct the Parliament session opposing the Supreme Court judgment," he said.
 
 He added, "Let the central government form a committee under the chairmanship of the Union water resources minister. This should include chief ministers of all four states and experts. A decision can be taken after a study on water available in all reservoirs of the Cauvery belt," he said.
