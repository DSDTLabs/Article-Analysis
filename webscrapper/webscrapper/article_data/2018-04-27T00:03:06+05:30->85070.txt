Pune: College of Engineering Pune (CoEP) has been chosen by the ministry of human resource development and World Bank to mentor Manipur Technical University under the Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP). 

 Mukul Sutaone, dean of academics at CoEP, said, “This is the third phase of the project. In the first phase, we did quality improvement in undergraduate programme. In the second phase, we were into improving postgraduate programmes. We were successful and hence were selected for mentoring. We were given a college in Indore last year. We have now been given this college,” Sutaone said.
 
 V N Pandey, TEQIP coordinator and senior faculty, said, “We have been given about Rs 7.5 crore. We will spend Rs 1.35 crore in mentoring the colleges. We have defined targets and we will see how we did in the key performance indicators in 2021.” 
 
 The CoEP team received the letter on March 20. “ We will do a need analysis of the university to measure their strengths and weaknesses and chalk out an activity calender in administration, academics, research and placement. We will ensure that the students have a specialized skill set that the employers want,” senior faculty and corporate relations officer Sandeep Meshram said.
