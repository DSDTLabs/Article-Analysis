Ahmedabad: Sirajkhan alias Kabootar, a notorious criminal escaped police custody on Monday by jumping into a waiting car while four policemen were escorting him between two departments on Civil Hospital campus. The cops were not accompanied by an ASI-level officer, which is the norm. Kabootar had recently been arrested by the SOG after jumping interim bail, and was then sent to Civil Hospital on April 17 for treating his injured leg.

On the way, Kabootar sprang into the car and locked it from inside. The policemen escorting him said they had tried to chase him down till the gate, but could not as the car sped away,” said a senior police official of Shahibaug police station.
 
 Shahibaug police have arrested the four policemen, who had been escorting Kabootar, for negligence of duty. Police said the accused policemen have been booked under sections 222, 223, 224, and 114 of the IPC for neglicence and aiding the escape of a prisoner or undertrial from police custody.
 
 “Rajiv Damor, Rama Sunma, Mahesh Pandya and Vanraj Solanki have been arrested for escorting the prisoner without an officer of the rank of assistant sub-inspector, and not handcuffing him while escorting him from one department to another for treatment,” said a senior police official of Shahibaug police station.
