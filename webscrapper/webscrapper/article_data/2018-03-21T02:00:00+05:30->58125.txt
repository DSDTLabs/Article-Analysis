PATNA: After a rigorous one-year training, 949 recruits were on Monday inducted into the Central Reserve Police Force ( ).

 The induction ceremony took place at the Recruit Training Centre at Rajgir in Nalanda district, one of the CRPF’s five such training centres in the country.
 
 CRPF’s Bihar sector IG M S Bhatia inspected the passing-out parade by the new recruits.
 
 This is among the first batches of the recruits, in which the team of 10 to 12 recruits formed for training will not be dissolved. The teams, as they are, will be sent to different battalions of the CRPF. Earlier, the teams used to be dissolved after the training for field posting of the recruits.
 
 According to IG Bhatia, the CRPF HQ has decided not to dissolve the teams so as not to disrupt the brotherhood and mutual trust developed during the training. “Trust and bonding among the forces play a key role in the battlegrounds,” he said.
 
 Bhatia said the recruits also underwent a four-week training in jungle warfare and were also trained in close-quarter battle, handling GPS and other advanced devices, crowd control and disaster management.
 
 On March 12 this year, 485 recruits were inducted into the CRPF from its additional training centre at Mokama.
