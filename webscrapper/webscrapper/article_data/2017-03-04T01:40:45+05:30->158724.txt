NEW DELHI:   at   on Friday recovered over 2kg in gold metal strips and a rod from an Indian arriving from Dubai. The gold worth over Rs 60 lakhs in value had been meticulously painted white and then concealed in different items, the passenger was carrying.

 Custom officials said that this was a new modus operandi, with smugglers trying to paint gold items first before hiding them inside electronic items.
 
 According to officials, the passenger was intercepted after he had crossed the green channel. After through checking of his baggage, something suspicious was spotted on the x-ray. However, the passenger denied having anything inside his baggage, which included a speaker and an amplifier.
 
 “The images after the x-ray were suspicious so we opened the speaker. A gold metal rod weighing 700gms was found inside the speaker which had been painted white and similarly 36 gold metal strips weighing close to 1,400grams were found inside the amplifier. This is an ingenious concealment and we are seeing such a case after close to one and a half years,” said a customs official.
 
 Officials said the gold must have been placed inside the speaker and amplifier so that it could have been difficult to detect. “We are trained to detect new modus operandi like these every day and intense scrutiny of the electronic items led us to the discovery of the gold bars,” the official added. The passenger was arrested under section 104 of the Customs Act.
