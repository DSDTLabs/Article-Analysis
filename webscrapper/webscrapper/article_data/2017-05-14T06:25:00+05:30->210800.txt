Bokaro: The district police on Saturday initiated a drive to identify   purchased by   from the money collected by them as  . “This is the first step towards attachment of the properties.

 Working on the strategy, the district police got the state police’s approval to attach the property of naxal commander Nepal Mahto alias Ranvijay. Bokaro SP Y S Ramesh said, “We had sent a proposal in this regard to DGP D K Pandey and got his approval for the same.”
 
 He added, “We will first attach Ranvijay’s property at Pek under Nawadih Block. He purchased a plot of land and a house in Pek from the levy he collected through unlawful means. We have planned to attach all such properties that naxals have purchased with the levy money.”
 
 The police have also started to identify lands and houses of naxals. Ramesh, who is monitoring the progress of his team in this regard, said, “We are also waiting for an approval to attach the properties of naxal commanders Santosh Mahto, Duryodhan Mahto and others in the area.” 
 
 Police will also raid illegal coal mines and hubs of transportation of illegally procured coal in Maoist-dominated zones. Illegal coal business is one of the major sources of revenue for Maoist rebels.
