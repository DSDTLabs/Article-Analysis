BENGALURU: Creating awareness on the ground and through social media having yielded little in the past 25 days, the police department has warned the public of stern action if rumours continue to be spread on social media, and citizens are assaulted.

 Police across the state have already booked several cases against people involved in assaulting mistaken child-lifters, and Bengaluru commissioner T Suneel Kumar on Friday said that action will also be initiated against those spreading these messages.
 
 
 A fake video of a  , which first emerged in Chennai before it surfaced in remote districts of  , has been spreading through social media, especially WhatsApp, creating panic.
 
 If vigilantes in many villagers are taking turns as guards, mobs attacking unknown people have used everything from cricket bats to wooden logs as weapons. In the case of Kaluram, 26, who was lynched on Wednesday, the mob had tied his hands and legs and dragged him on the road while others assaulted him.
 
 “The public is instructed not to react to rumours and take the law into their hands. Our department is here to handle such cases and the public must call the control room if they feel someone is loitering suspiciously in their area. We reiterate that no child has been kidnapped and no gang that kidnaps children to sell organs is in the state or Bengaluru. All such news is false and baseless. We will, however, take serious action against those assaulting innocent people merely on suspicion,” Suneel Kumar said.
