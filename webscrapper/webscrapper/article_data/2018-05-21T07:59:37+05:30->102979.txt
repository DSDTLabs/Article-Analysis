 Everyday, four children are diagnosed with eye cancer in India and worldwide.
 
 “With one in 18,000 live births being detected with this disease, there is a need to create awareness among parents on the importance of early detection of this disease and getting regular eye check-ups done”, says Dr  , Operation Eyesight Universal Institute for Eye Cancer Ocular Oncologist, LVPEI.
 
 Hyderabad police commissioner   flagged off the run in the presence of Dr. G. N. Rao, LVPEI chairman.
 
 The funds raised by the run will be used for treating poor children suffering from the disease, free of cost, and for resources for future research to explore new treatment options. “Early diagnosis can help save the children through chemotherapy and focal treatment, thus saving their life and the vision,” said Dr Swathi Kaliki, Ocular oncologist.
 
 “It is time to make detailed eye check-ups a part of mandatory paediatric examinations. Parents and physicians should be made aware about symptoms which could otherwise be easily dismissed as an infection. There is a need for increased awareness among parents about this life-threatening disease,” Dr Swathi Kaliki added.
