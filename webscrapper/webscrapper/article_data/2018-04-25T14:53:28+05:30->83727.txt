MADURAI: For motorists in the city, it is hard to miss S  , a headconstable manning the signals under the Teppakulam traffic jurisdiction. With broad hand gestures of ‘stop’ and ‘go and a stylish walk back and forth, he keeps himself busy regulating traffic as well as creating awareness on road rules simultaneously.

 What makes Rajapandi stand apart is his attitude — he greets regulars at the signals with a smile and appears to be enjoying his work. The scorching sun fails to deter him from standing for hours together in the middle of the road. Nor does his temper give away as he is almost always seen cool.
 
 He is one among the first set of 10 police personnel chosen by the city traffic unit to undergo special training and be converted into ‘smart traffic cop’. Suffice it to say that all of them have been making a distinct difference at the signals they man. But, Rajapandi seems to be the most impressive of all as evidenced by the cash reward he won from city police commissioner   recently.
 
 Selected on a voluntary basis, the ‘smart traffic cops’ are specially trained to develop a rapport with the commuters and make them adhere to traffic rules in a friendly manner. Madurai city police commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal said that it was a different attempt to make the commuters wear safety gear and follow road rules. They had plans to increase the number of ‘smart traffic cops’ in future, he said.
 
 The primary job of traffic cops was to regulate the crowd and ensure smooth passage of vehicles. But the   did not stop there. They appreciated those wearing helmets and seat belts with gifts and appreciation stickers. Those not wearing safety gears got a piece of their mind but not challans. They also issued pamphlets prepared by the city traffic unit highlighting importance of following traffic rules. The video of Rajapandi manning the signal posted on the city police page has gone viral with over 380 shares in 48 hours.
