KOLKATA: The   has sought a report from a south   where several students had alleged they had been forced to give an undertaking over "lesbianism" on the school premises. 

 On Monday, the guardians staged an agitation and allegedly threatened the teacher in charge of the school for coaxing selected students to write that they will not be involved in any such relationship further. 
 
 After receiving the allegations, education minister   sought a report. Senior government officials pointed out that though there may be a debate and favourable decisions on behalf of homosexuality, any sex act is prohibited on school premises. 
 
 The accused students claimed that they had only been sitting inside the classroom and had put their arms around the others' shoulders when they were pulled up. The guardians alleged that some of these students were actually witness to a molestation on school premises last month and hence had been targeted.
