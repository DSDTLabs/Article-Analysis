AHMEDABAD: Two   who were suspended from the assembly have challenging their long   periods in the Gujarat  .

 Amrish Der, the   Rajula and Baldevji Thakor of Kalol urged the court to revoke the speakerâ€™s decision to suspend them for three years and one year, respectively. 
 
 Der was suspended for charging at and assaulting a BJP MLA in the house earlier this month. Thakor was suspended for an alleged incident in the assembly lobby.
 
 Sources said both MLAs questioned the length of their suspension holding that the speaker cannot suspend a member for more than one session.
 
 The MLAs urged the court to revoke the suspension order and permit them to take part in the proposed no-confidence motion against the speaker on March 28.
 
 A division bench of Chief Justice R S Reddy and Justice V M Pancholi is likely to hear the matter on Tuesday, said B M Mangukiya, who represented the MLAs.
 
 Another Congress MLA, Pratap Dudhat from Savarkundla, is also likely to approach the HC over his three-year suspension.
