MALAPPURAM: Kadampuzha police on Tuesday registered a case against a teacher at a higher secondary government-aided school for sharing an outrageous comment on the 8-year-old Kathua gangrape victim on Facebook.

 Police said the case was registered against P B Harilal, Malayalam teacher at   in Marakkara, based on a complaint received at the police station two days ago. The accused will be arrested after examining the content of his social media account, they said.
 
 Harilal was suspended by the school manager on Monday after the school authorities received written complaints about him from parents and local residents.
 
 Harilal had shared the comment made by one Vishnu Nandakumar on the rape victim. Nanadakumar had posted on his  : It was good that she was killed now. Otherwise, she would have come as a bomb against India. Nandakumar, a bank employee, was subsequently sacked by his employer and the police registered a case against him under Section 153 (a) of the IPC, for promoting enmity between different religious groups.
 
 After Harilal shared the post, local residents, including parents of the students studying in the school, had launched a campaign demanding action against the teacher. The school manager had come up with a clarification that the teacher has apologized but the protest demanding the teacher’s expulsion continued, which led to his suspension.
 
 Kadampuzha police informed that the cyber wing of police will conduct a detailed examination of Harilal’s posts and comments before recording his arrest. “We have to verify the authenticity of the account before interrogating the accused,” a police officer said.
