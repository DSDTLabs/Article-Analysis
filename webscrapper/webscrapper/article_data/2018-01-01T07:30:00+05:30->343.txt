GURUGRAM: Unhappy with delay in possession, a group of home   who have invested in the Indi Homes housing project in Bhiwadi, 50 km from Gurgaon, have approached   ( ) seeking compensation for the delay.

 Around 380 buyers have invested in the project, which was launched by MVL in 2009 with a promise of possession by 2014, later revised to 2015. But till now, investors said, construction has not been completed. Buyers claimed to have paid around 95% of their unit costs by 2013, under a construction-linked plan, yet they are still waiting for their flats long after the promised date of possession has passed. “We are trying to convince the builder to compete the construction through emails and personal visits. But it has yielded no result so far,” said  , one of the buyers. 
 
 Countering their allegations, the developer said the project has five towers of which three are ready for possession. “Buyers have to pay their balance dues in an escrow account, which they are not doing despite our numerous reminders,” said a spokesperson for the developer. 
 
 He said work in the remaining two towers is at an advanced stage. “There is delay in possession in a few cases, but even for those, outstanding dues have to be cleared first. There are some speculators who are trying to arm-twist the company for vested interests, and are spreading false information about the project,” he said, adding that though the project was launched in 2009, most bookings were made in 2013.
 
 Sudhanshu  , a home buyer, said they came to know of the residential project through advertisements. “We were assured timely possession, along withe the reassurance that in case of delay, buyers would get interest till possession,” said Sudhanshu. “Having failed to get any relief from local authorities, we are left with no option but to approach the consumer forum,” said  , another buyer.
