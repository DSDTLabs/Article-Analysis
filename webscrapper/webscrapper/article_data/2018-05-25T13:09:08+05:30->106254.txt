Sundar Surya's ' ', starring  ,   and   as the titular Ammamma in lead roles is a family drama that charts the lives of a joint family split up over petty issues.
The family politics played out in the film are surely something everyone can relate to. However, that wouldn't hinder this film from being interesting if only it had a fresher treatment. The first half of the film just plays out like any other film that charts a family's journey.
 Most of the three sons and two daughters of a family want their share of the ancestral property so they can lead a life of their own. However, when a daughter and son-in-law disagree, it leads to a rift in the family that causes them to not meet for 20 long years. Brought together again with the promise of money by Ammamma Sita Mahalakshmi (Sumitra), the family meets again, anxious to get their part of the share.
 Santosh (Naga Shaurya) however tries his best to help keep his Ammamma happy for at least as long as they're there and keeps trying to delay the inevitable. His Maradalu Sita (Shamlee) however keeps working against him due to petty childhood fights.
 With the first half seeing Santosh's plans almost foiled due to Sita, it remains to be seen if he will succeed in bringing the family together again.
