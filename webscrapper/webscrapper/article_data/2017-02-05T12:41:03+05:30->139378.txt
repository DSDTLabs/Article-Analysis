TV actor   met with an accident when a bike bumped into his car.
 
  The actor was on his way when a bike with three young boys came raging and bumped into his car. On getting down from his car he saw all three of them without helmets for their safety. At first the actor was quite agitated over the fact that they were all without helmets, but after seeing them all shaken up by the incident, he let them go without saying much.
  
  Though, the actor made sure to tell them how unsafe it was to drive so fast without a helmet on a bike, he also didn't hold them back for their fault.
  
  
 
  
  The boys, who were in shock after the accident apologised to Karan Tacker and left from the place.
  
  Karan's car has gone to the garage to get fixed.
