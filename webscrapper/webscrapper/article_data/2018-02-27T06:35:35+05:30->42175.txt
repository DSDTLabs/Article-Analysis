BENGALURU: Traffic police are mulling over the proposal of collecting Rs 25,000 as   to facilitate   from one hospital to the airport or to another hospital.

 The proposal was mooted after factoring the   manpower and logistics deployed to ensure there are no roadblocks in taking harvested organs to recipients.
 
 Police maintain that the number of green corridors created in the city has been on the rise and it’s putting pressure on the force. However, a final decision is yet to be taken on this.
 
 Additional commissioner of police (traffic) R Hithendra told TOI: “We’re still debating the issue. Traffic police have been creating green corridors on being alerted by hospitals as saving lives is crucial. But we realize that doctors and hospitals charge the recipients who benefit by the  .”
 
 Creating a green corridor is expensive as policemen have to be deployed at different junctions, have to block traffic on many roads, arrange for pilot vehicles with senior officials, including a deputy commissioner of police, and ensure the ambulance moves uninterrupted. “Keeping all these in mind, we’re debating whether we can charge and how much should it be. As of now, our officers feel we should charge Rs 25,000,” he pointed out.
 
 According to a traffic cop, at least 100 policemen have to be deployed for one green corridor.
