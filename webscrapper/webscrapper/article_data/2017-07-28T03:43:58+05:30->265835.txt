NEW DELHI: Senior JD(U) leader   may be upset about   Kumar’s changed political affiliation but party leaders don’t see any rebellion in the ranks even as they had anticipated minor ripples.

 After a few JD(U) leaders, including   MPs Ali Anwar and  , sounded rebellious, there was speculation that Sharad Yadav would echo similar views and might quit. 
 
 However, as the day progressed, the party managed to pacify Yadav. Sources said Nitish had a telephonic conversation with Yadav and convinced the latter that the decision was in the interest of the party.
 
 JD(U) sources claimed that a senior central minister, who is known for his strong ties with Yadav, was in continuous touch with him and managed to persuade him that the alliance with   was a mismatch.
 
 “The chief minister’s resignation followed by changing allies was a huge decision, therefore, some resentment was bound to happen.
 
 However, there is no rebellion as such. Some leaders have expressed unhappiness but none has spoken about quitting the party,” a senior JD(U) leader said. The leader said Yadav also knew that he was no more the party president and had very few in the party to call his loyalists.
 
 Although Yadav seems to have been pacified at least for now, JD(U)’s alliance with   is a major embarrassment for him as he used to strut around as the party pasha and fancied himself as the architect of a ‘grand secular alliance’ in Bihar.
 
 However, Nitish has exposed him as an emperor without clothes. This is the second time that his bluff has been called. 
 
 Ironically, he was opposed to the break-up with BJP as well. However, the problem is that Yadav has little option as he is dependent on Nitish or Lalu for his political significance.
