THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Sticking to the routine of moving a motion for adjournment and then staging a walkout for the third successive day, the opposition upped the ante in the assembly on Wednesday and demanded the resignation of food and civil supplies minister  , for his "incompetence in crisis management". 

 While 'women's safety' and 'goonda raj' were the issues that rocked the assembly on the previous days, Wednesday saw the UDF taking up 'skyrocketing price of rice and essential commodities'. 
 
 "The government has failed in controlling the price rise. The food and civil supplies department has only spent only 7.04% of the plan fund. Thilothaman is a complete failure as a minister. We demand his resignation," said opposition leader   before the UDF, KC(M) and   members staged a walkout as the Speaker denied discussion on the adjournment motion moved by IUML member M Ummer.
 
 Though Thilothaman tried to put up a brave face blaming the rise in price of rice on the decreased flow of the commodity from Andhra Pradesh and the 'Kollam lobby' which was exploiting the situation, the opposition sharpened its attack citing news reports on government's failed market interventions. The minister also listed out various measures, including a scientific reconstitution of price control cell and setting up district-level rice shops, to address the issue.
 
 "The state's share of food grains under National Food Security Act was fixed by the previous UPA government when   was the minister of state for food and civil supplies," Thilothaman said.
 
 Coming to his aid, CPM MLA S Sharma said the statutory rationing system in the state was sabotaged by the UDF government, while chief minister   urged all parties to stand united in exerting pressure on the central government to retain the state's original share of 16.25 lakh metric tonne of food grains.
 
 "It will be the main agenda of the all-party delegation being sent to New Delhi," the chief minister said.
