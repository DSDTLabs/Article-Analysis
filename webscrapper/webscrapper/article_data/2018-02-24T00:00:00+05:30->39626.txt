 Being in Bengaluru is very special. There is a strong connect between the city, the Kapoor family and its legacy. All of us have made films in different parts of Karnataka. Cinema is in my blood; it is my passion, it is love, it is food for the soul. I think festivals are a celebration of cinema and being a lover of films right from birth, as someone from this family, I think it is an absolute honour to give my support to Kannada cinema. A film festival is the coming together of different kinds of films. BIFFes is not about celebrating only Kannada cinema, but about celebrating world cinema, which also goes to prove that cinema is the coming together of people.
 
 
 
 I watch all kinds of films, across different languages, and not only English. I try to catch up on world cinema now that subtitles are available for all. This is also why it’s nice to be a part of film festivals, as you get to know different kind of movies.
 
 
 
 I thought that after having a child it was the perfect atmosphere for me to be in — with women around me. The producers of the film are also two women. The energies of all of us girls has come together. It is going to be a fun ride with some wonderful actors.
 
 
 
 Of course, especially in terms of women. In fact, I had recently written an article for Unicef about the survival of newborn babies and the girl child. I am someone who would like to stand up for their rights, stand up for women, stand up in terms of whether it is harassment towards them in casting of films or in different kinds of jobs; I am in full support of that.
 
 
 
 Bengaluru has always been special; it is an absolutely stunning city. Apart from the food, the people are warm and it is truly one of the most dynamic cities of India. I have a feeling that my grandfather, Raj Kapoor’s spirit is among us under the stars, blessing us all, telling us filmmakers, storytellers and actors here to keep up the good work and continue making the kind of films we are making. He is smiling upon us, not because I am here, but for his love for Mysuru, the most beautiful city in Karnataka.
