In an attempt to popularise bicycle sharing at   stations and to mark World Bicyle Day, PEDL, a dock-less bicycle company, and CMRL organized a 'treasure hunt' at Thirumangalam metro station on Sunday. The company is one of the firms that has tied up with CMRL to offer bicycle sharing at stations.
 
 The programme drew a lot of attention with 16-year-old P Gokulapriya saying, "This is the first time I am seeing my father cycle." 
 
 Narasim Prasad, director, systems and operations, CMRL said the service would be extended to more stations based on the response at Anna Nagar East, Anna Nagar Tower and Thirumanagalam. Arun Gajendran, assistant marketing manager, Zoomcar, said, "By engaging people in small-scale neighbourhood activities, we make them understand why cycling is good for health. Since our partnership with CMRL in December, we have seen 9,000 uses on our app." 
 
 M S R Manoj, senior business manager, PEDL, said, "Cycle sharing services have proven to be an alternative to reduce congestion."
