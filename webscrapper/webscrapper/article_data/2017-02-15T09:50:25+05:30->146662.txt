DHANBAD: If a person is found drinking or possessing a bottle of beer, he can land in jail for up to 10 years, but if a person is found guilty of raping a woman, he gets a jail term of just five years, former Bihar chief minister   said here on Tuesday. 

 Manjhi arrived in the city to attend an event organised by  , to felicitate 'mountain man' Dasarath Manjhi, who carved a 110 metre-long path through the rocks in Gehlor in Bihar.
 
 Criticising the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act, 2016, the former chief minister said that over 20,000 people are languishing in jail, 90% of them belonging to the economically-weaker sections. 
 
 Taking a dig at Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, he said after the formation of the grand alliance with Lalu Prasad, Nitish had lost the tag of 'Mr Clean'. "The development that we are talking about in Bihar is only on paper and not on ground," he said. The grand alliance is the biggest hurdle for development in Bihar, he added.
 
 Manjhi further said, "Nitish had joined hands with   to come to power and wanted to become the prime minister. However, after Prime Minister   was declared as the prime ministerial candidate, he left the alliance. Bihar is reeling under Jungle Raj 2."
