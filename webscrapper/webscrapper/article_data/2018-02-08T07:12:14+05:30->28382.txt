AHMEDABAD: The   across the state has urged the   not to increase the   of Rs 15,000, Rs 25,000 and Rs 27,000 for primary, secondary and higher secondary education institutes respectively.

 The association has stated that they have made representation to the government. 
 
 “If the government increased the fee, the parents association will launch a state-wide stir. The present upper limit is sufficient and the schools who want to increase the fee can approach the fee regulatory committee formed under the Gujarat Self-Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2017,” said Naresh Shah, the president of the association.
 
 Shah further said that the association will send about 50,000 postcards to the government asking the government not to raise the cap. 
 
 The government has been asked by the apex court to reconsider the upper limit. The government has also formed a committee to look into the fixation of the upper limit.
 
 Even as the government has formed the committee, the schools have asked students to pay the remaining amount for the year 2017-18 by February 15. Some self-financed schools have threatened to levy hefty fines if the fees were not paid.
 
 Officials said that some of the schools have even made it clear to the parents that if the fee was reduced their facilities including air conditioner facilities among others would also be withdrawn. A parent requesting anonymity said that the schools management has said that the fee committee was not considering the AC bills.
 
 The threat comes at a time when the government is likely to announce its decision over changes in upper limits of respective school fees by February 28.
