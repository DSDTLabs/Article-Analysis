 The ministry, it’s been learnt, could nominate two sportspersons for the Khel Ratna and three athletes for the Arjuna award as it reserves the rights to do so.
 
 As per norms, a candidate’s performance of last four years up to December 31, 2017 will be taken into account to arrive at the total points accumulated by a sportsperson.
