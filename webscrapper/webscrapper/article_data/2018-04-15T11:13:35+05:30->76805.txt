HYDERABAD: Hyderabad police, on an average, record four cases of ganja peddling every month. Though police conduct regular vehicle checks to crack down on drug transport, they bust most cases based on tip-offs. 

 "We had tried decoy operations previously and realised they do not work in drug cases. We work on information from reliable sources. Most drug rackets were busted either on tip-offs or vehicle checks," Hyderabad additional deputy commissioner of police, Task Force,   told STOI. 
 
 The Hyderabad police commissionerate limits had recorded highest number of Narcotic   and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act cases (94) among the three commissionerates in 2017.
 
 However, the Task Force official said the frequency of drug transportation has come down in the past few weeks. "One of the most commonly available contraband in the city is ganja. As the city is not suitable for cultivating ganja, the weed is transported from Agency areas in   and Odisha, which have cooler climes and suitable for growing ganja," the additional   said.
 
 Apart from the Agency areas in Andhra Pradesh, ganja was being brought to the city from Chhattisgarh and  . "We carry out vehicle checks almost every day at toll gates so that it becomes difficult for the offenders to transport drugs via road. Last year, we had caught five Nigerians trafficking drugs. It is difficult to get information about drugs being supplied and transported in the city," Special Operations Team (SOT) inspector   said.
 
 The inspector said hard drugs like cocaine, LSD blots, amphetamine tablets and   were being obtained by peddlers and their networks from Goa and Mumbai. According to police, offenders use pubs and rave parties to sell hard drugs.
 
 After last year's drug bust, which exposed that a large number of students were involved in substance abuse, parents should keep a watch on their children, Chaitanya Kumar added.
