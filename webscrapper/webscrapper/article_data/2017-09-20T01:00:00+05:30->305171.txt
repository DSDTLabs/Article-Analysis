Real-life bhai-behen Shraddha and   have been cast as siblings in director Apoorva Lakhia’s 'Haseena Parkar', co-produced by Sameer Antulay and Babu Tyagi, and produced by Nahid Khan. We’re told that the actors, who play   and   in the biopic, had an emotional outburst on the sets. Since the Kapoors are extremely close to each other, they infused their asli feelings into their characters. For example, one intense scene, in which Dawood is seen leaving his sister Haseena behind, had plenty of emotional lines. Shraddha and Siddhanth empathised with their characters so much that during the shoot, they started crying for real. Haseena’s cousin Sameer and his daughters were on the set, too, when the scene was being shot, and were moved by their performance. In fact, Apoorva had to call off the shoot for a while to let the actors collect themselves, before shooting the next scene.
