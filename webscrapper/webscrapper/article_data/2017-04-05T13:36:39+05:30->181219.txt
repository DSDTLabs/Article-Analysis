PUNE: What was supposed to be a friendly game of cricket on a Sunday morning quickly assumed dangerous proportions. 

 An argument during the match took an ugly turn, and ended with eight minor boys getting detained for the attempted murder of a 21-year-old man, and rioting, late on Sunday night. 
 
 The complainant was not even directly involved in the argument. In fact, he had played the role of a peacemaker, soothing tempers.
 
 “We have also arrested father of one of the minors for allegedly encouraging his son to attack the complainant  , resident of Suvarnagari in  ,” said Raghunath Phuge, senior inspector of Kothrud police station.
 
 It was a contentious umpiring decision that caused all the bad blood. 
 
 On the morning in question, the group of boys were playing cricket in Bhusari colony. During the match, a batsman was given out by the umpire, and started protesting against the decision. He kept insisting the decision was wrong. 
 
 However, members of the opposing team backed the umpire’s decision and within no time, a quarrel broke out. The batsman and other boys came to blows. “When he started hitting members of the opposing team, Kalokhe, who was also playing there, intervened and told them stop quarrelling. After that everyone dispersed,” Phuge said.
 
 The minor, who lives in the   area, returned home and told his father what happened. His father told him to settle scores, thus instigating an attack on his opponents. 
 
 “Armed with a sharp weapon, the minor and his friends went back to Left Bhusari Colony, and started searching for their opponents,” Phuge said, adding, “That was when they noticed Kalokhe in the area. They immediately assaulted him. They also went on a rampage in the area, creating a ruckus.”
 
 Kalokhe sustained injuries on his shoulder and left hand in the attack, but is out of danger, Phuge said. 
 
 Police have identified a few more suspects. “We will soon detain them,” Phuge said.
