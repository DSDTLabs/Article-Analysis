NEW DELHI:   leader Naresh Agrawal’s recitation of a couplet linking different Hindu gods with different types of liquor sparked a major uproar in   on Wednesday, providing BJP the opportunity to turn the tables on a belligerent opposition eager to attack the government on cow vigilantism and oppression of Dalits.

 Though Agrawal’s remarks were expunged by the chair, the treasury benches did not let go till he withdrew them and expressed regret for “hurting the sentiments” of people.
 
 Initially,   seemed to have an advantage as the party protested the government statement that there was no plan for a separate law for lynchings.
 
 The party also threatened to block all bills. Refusing to apologise to the “thekedars (contractors) of the Hindu religion”, Agrawal said he was merely quoting what he had seen written by “your people” on a dharamshala’s wall in UP.
 
 “Agrawal has withdrawn the remark. There is no question of an apology,” said Ram Gopal Yadav of SP, adding that I&B minister Smriti Irani had not apologised for quoting from apamphlet with derogatory references to goddess Durga in the Rajya Sabha last year. He was referring to an instance when Irani read out material distributed during a protest at JNU by anti-BJP students.
 
 “Agrawal would be liable for prosecution if he had made these remarks outside the House. He should apologise and withdraw the comment,” leader of the House Arun Jailtley said. Parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar said Agrawal had hurt the sentiments of Hindus.
 
 Deputy chairman P J Kurien admonished Agrawal for the “derogatory” remarks.
