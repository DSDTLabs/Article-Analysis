Director   never fails to give an extra edge to her characters. Previously in ‘Parched’, she got   perfectly slipping into traditional Rajasthani attire to depict the social evils in the state's villages. And this time Leena has got her leading lady   take up a look that has similarities to  's get-up from  's mystery drama, ‘The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo’ (2011). Amyra Dastur’s ‘RajmaChawal’ will have   playing a pivotal role. 

 
 According to a daily, it was after 50 iterations before the unit of ‘Rajma Chawal’ that the look was finalised. The report quoted a daily saying that the film will see Amyra sporting a badass look, which is similar to that of Rooney from ‘The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo’. In one of the stills, she is seen sporting an undercut with chevrons on the side. She will also have a number of tattoos on her body, with one on her neck [of a barcode] being distinctive.
 
 
 Moreover, another source from the production reportedly said that the unit brainstormed for days to decide how the lead actor should appear. There were all certain that the look should be something that Amyra hasn't sported before and distinct from the rest of the cast. They started with a sharp pixie haircut and rough curls, and after improvising on it, zeroed in on this one. 
 
 
 Reportedly, Amyra even suggested that she should go bald, but they knew that wouldn't fit the part, as well as this one, did.
 
 
 The film also features Anirudh Tanwar and is likely to release in November this year.
