Ahmedabad: International motivational speaker, author, educationist, and the former CEO of Mumbai Dabbawalas, Dr Pawan Agrawal, delivered a talk on management at the Ahmedabad Management Association (AMA) on Saturday. At the event, jointly organized by Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), Ahmedabad Advertising Circle Association and Young Indians, Agrawal highlighted the smooth supply chain management of Mumbai dabbawalas, who run a tiffin delivery empire in Mumbai with limited resources.

 “Dabbawalas work on simple principles — work hard with honesty, integrity and self-discipline,” said Agrawal. “For them, their work is worship, and even as the process is quite complicated, given the number of clients they serve every day, they hardly have an error rate.” Agrawal talked about simple principles such as giving priority to customer satisfaction, maintaining consistency in efforts and effective utilization of time. “Customer satisfaction is key to success of any business irrespective of its nature and dimension,” he said. “A business can thrive if its workforce is customer-oriented, delivers quality results, and meets deadlines.” The network of dabbawalas which make 16 million deliveries a day is a six sigma and ISO-certified operation. Despite earning an average Rs20,000 per month after delivering tiffin boxes and doing other odd jobs, the dabbawalas have ‘social responsibility’ initiatives in place as well. “So what if we earn little! We earn from society and it is our duty to give back, just like it is for any other business,” said Agrawal. “We established   Education Centre in Vikhroli, to provide free education to children of dabbawalas who may not be able to afford it otherwise.”
