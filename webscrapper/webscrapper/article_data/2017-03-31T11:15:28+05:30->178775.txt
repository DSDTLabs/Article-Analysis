CHENNAI: The   which will enter the second day on Friday is likely to push up prices of vegetables and fruits. 

 Koyambedu Vegetable Market Vendors'   Chandran said the supply of vegetables from   could drop by nearly 50%. "Supplies from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka will stop if the stir continues," he said.
 
 The association's   said 350 trucks brought supplies to the Koyambedu wholesale market every day. "If the strike continues, there would less supply and higher demand. This will automatically increase the prices," he said. The city gets its major supply of tomatoes from   of Karnataka and with the strike continuing this would stop, said Soundararajan.
 
 Small traders and pushcart vendors will be affected due to the strike as they will not be able to purchase vegetables from wholesalers in bulk as is the usual practice. This will hit the availability and customers will have to bear the hike in prices, he said. 
 
 On Thursday evening, hotels and restaurants in the city resorted to panic buying as news spread that the strike would continue indefinitely. S Saravanan, a trader at the Koyambedu market who sources tomatoes from agricultural farms in Mulbagal, said, "Truckers from Karnataka have said they will not be able to operate in the city from Friday. So wholesale traders have reached out to farmers in and around districts to source vegetables to the market in smaller vehicles."
