GUWAHATI: CPM politburo member   on Saturday blamed the BJP-led governments in Assam and at the Centre for the Dima Hasao violence in which police clashed with protesters who were demonstrating against reports of a draft plan of the Naga peace agreement which suggested including Dima Hasao in the proposed  . 

 At least eight protesters were injured in police action when the protest rally at   turned violent. The protesters had gone on a rampage, attacking the security forces and blocking the railway station, forcing the security forces to open fire. Two of the protesters, who were critically wounded, succumbed to their injuries later.
 
 Karat said the government is responsible for the unrest and alleged that they have passed on the 'secrets' of Nagalim to the RSS. "I believe that this is directly a result of the non-transparent, dishonest policies of the central government. Our party has been consistently demanding - both inside and outside the parliament - that the draft of the agreement, which the government claims to have finalized, should be made public. But it seems that the government has outsourced everything to the RSS," Karat said. 
 
 Strongly condemning the "draft plan of Nagalim that proposes the inclusion of territories from Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh," Karat claimed, "The RSS is controlling the government and the Centre is outsourcing its responsibility to the RSS. This is precisely the kind of policy which the BJP is adopting in the northeast and it is extremely harmful for the development and unity of the region. We believe that the government of Assam, along with the Centre, is totally accountable for the violence."
 
 Despite Karat's allegations, the RSS have refuted the charges level against them for the recent crisis in the district.
