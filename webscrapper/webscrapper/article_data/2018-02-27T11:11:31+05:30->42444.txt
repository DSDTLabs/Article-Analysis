HYDERABAD: Taking a cue from Karnataka and   bar associations, the   and   bar associations in Hyderabad High Court too are gearing up to launch a massive agitation against the inordinate delay in filling the posts of judges. 

 Presently, the HC is working with only 30 judges, despite its sanctioned strength of 61. Starting from May, at least 3 judges will retire in next 12 months. The   and Telangana HC bar associations have come together and decided to hold a general body meeting on February 27. The meeting will be held in the association hall at 1:45pm, said Pasam Sujatha, the secretary of   in a notice issued conveying about the lawyers' meet.
 
 "Our demands are to ensure filling of the vacancies of the judges at the High Court and also at subordinate courts. We are concerned about no appointment a regular chief justice to the Hyderabad High Court. Added to this is the pressure being brought on subordinate courts to dispose off all pre 2012 pending cases", the notice read.
 
 AP HC Advocates Association President Challa Dhanamjaya and Telangana HC Advocates Association President Jalli Kanakaiah are expected to lead the movement that is meant to protect the judiciary from deliberate attempts aimed at making the institution defunct in the long run, said lawyers, who are spearheading the movement.
 
 The general body meet may chalk out an agitation strategy that may begin with boycott of courts and may also expand to various other forms of resentment, the lawyers said.
