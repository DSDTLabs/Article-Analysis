PANAJI: Urban upper classes often frown upon the quality of education in government schools, but when the directorate of education, with an eye on strengthening co-scholastic activities in these schools, recently called upon professionals and other educated individuals in the state to   their service, they chose to bypass the opportunity to help the children of such institutions. Recent years have seen hundreds of government primary schools shutting down for want of students. 

 Based on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s idea,   was introduced in schools across the country, and Goa was one among the 20 states that agreed to implement the programme. The idea was to involve volunteers from different walks of life to strengthen co-scholastic activities in government schools, enhance community involvement in government-run elementary institutes, and, resultantly, help improve learning output of students in these schools.
 
 Vidyanjali was to begin from June 2016 and applications from volunteers were invited under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. 
 
 Owing to the near nil response at the time, it was decided to implement the scheme in Goa for the academic year 2017-18. However, the response was once again so poor that officials have had to give up on any hopes of implementing it in Goa.
 
 The scheme, which involves volunteers engaging children in reading, creative writing, public speaking, play acting and preparing story books, among other things, has been effectively implemented in many other states.
 
 “The response has been very poor. There are hardly any applications,” said director of education G P Bhat.
 
 The volunteer scheme is also open to persons of Indian origin, who hold Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards. But, although Goa has a large number working abroad, the state did not see the scheme generating any interest among the diaspora.
