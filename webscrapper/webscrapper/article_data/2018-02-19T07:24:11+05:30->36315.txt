 Rajesh Singh, who had sought permission for his daughter’s wedding to be held on February 20, said, “I had applied for the approval on February 10 and was told to come after four days. When I went there after four days, I was asked to come on February 19”.
 
 Susheel Sinha said, “I was forced to drop one of the plans from preparations because I kept running for 12 days for the permission for DJ because so many formalities were to be completed.”
 
 However, according to DM Kaushal Raj Sharma, the process of request approval has been framed according to ceremony dates and time period. “Daily hundreds of applications are being posted for their respective thanas for further enquiry and it takes a little time. The administration is granting permission on every request after verification,” he said.
