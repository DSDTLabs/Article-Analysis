BENGALURU: The   (ED) has attached assets belonging to   as part on its ongoing investigation into an   (APHB) project that it believes was given as quid pro quo for investments into firms of former AP chief minister YS Rajasekhar Reddy’s son Jagan Mohan Reddy.

 Embassy denies any direct transactions with Reddy and said it will challenge the agency’s move.
 
 
 The agency attached assets worth Rs 117.74 crore belonging to three builders, including Embassy, that were part of the consortia that bagged the APHB project before the separation of Telangana.
 
 Embassy Group CMD Jitu   told STOI his firm had partnered with Indu Projects — leader of the consortia — for a venture and subsequently sold the stake and exited the venture. He said the ED had issued a notice owing to the firm’s partnership with Indu Projects and recent developments and that as security,   has deposited Rs 44 crore in the form of a fixed deposit and offered it for attachment.
 
 “We exited the partnership in 2007, and Embassy has not had any dealings with Jagan. We’re confident we’ll be exonerated of all charges as we have not been directly involved in this matter,” Virwani added.
 
 The ED believes Consortia leader Indu Projects, led by Syam Prasad Reddy, madeillegal gains for doing favours to Jagan at the cost of the government exchequer. The   has also filed multiple chargesheets naming Syam and the ED attached assets belonging to his firm and him in connection with two other projects too.
 
 The attachment of assets is based on a provisional order, which Embassy will challenge. The ED has been probing cases involving Jagan under the provisions of the Prevention of   Act, 2002, while the   is running parallel investigations.
