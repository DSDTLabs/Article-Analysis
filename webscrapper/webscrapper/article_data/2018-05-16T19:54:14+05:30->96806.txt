A mother’s love is unconditional, but what happens when societal norms and pressures challenge the same and makes one wonder twice? This is what Arun Mandala’s short film, Melancholy, is about. This film, which is a little under six minutes in duration, stars  ,   and Virginia in lead roles. 

 “This film is about a daughter, who is writing to her mother after four years of separation, about how she is just like her in spirit and wants to live her life according to her choice. The idea struck me when I realised that no matter how open-minded parents are, there are times when it is difficult for the unconditional love of a mother to accept certain things. This could be due to the ways of the society or otherwise. The film presents one such scenario, in which there is a mother, whose daughter has chosen to go ahead and live with her partner. This severs the ties between the mother and daughter. The daughter then chooses to tell her mother how they are alike and the film explores the aspect of acceptance of   and lesbian love, which is something that hasn’t been represented much in films,” says Arun.
