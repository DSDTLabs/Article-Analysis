CHANDIGARH: With the opposition demanding resignation of   from the Punjab cabinet, Punjab chief minister   on Sunday said that there was no question of asking the former cricketer-turned-politician to quit because of the Supreme Court proceedings against him in a 30-year-old  .

 
 Amarinder said the SC had stayed Sidhu’s conviction in the 2007 road rage case and was yet to pronounce its verdict on his petition challenging the high court order. The question of the local bodies’ minister resigning, merely because the state government had repeated its stand of 30 years in the case before the SC, didn’t arise, he said.
 
 “There was neither any impediment in Sidhu’s induction into the cabinet nor in his continuation now, in view of the stay on his conviction,” Amarinder said.
 
 The CM’s remarks came following reports that Sidhu had been asked to resign from the cabinet. 
 
 Amarinder said he hoped that the judge would take cognizance of Sidhu’s contribution to society and the country in deciding the case.
 
 Amarinder described the recent developments in the matter as unfortunate, but maintained that his government had taken the only legally tenable stand in the Supreme Court. On reports suggesting that the government had deliberately not supported Sidhu in the Supreme Court, Amarinder said unless the prosecution received fresh inputs, it was not legally possible for it to add a new element to its arguments. 
 
 Speaking from legal viewpoint, the prosecution was duty-bound to go by facts and stick to the same, he said, adding taking a U-turn from the stand taken by the government in the trial and high courts was not an option.
 
 Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar said, “Congress has full faith in the judiciary and stands behind Sidhu in his quest for justice. It’s well known to everyone that he is an upright and a kind-hearted person.”
