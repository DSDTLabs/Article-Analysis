Jalandhar: Punjab Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson and the chief whip of the party in the state assembly, Sukhpal Singh Khaira has said that as the Supreme Court had given two months’ time to resolve the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue, it was the responsibility of both the Congress government and the SAD-BJP alliance to safeguard the interests of the state.

 The AAP has also asked the state government to call a special session of the Punjab assembly to pass a resolution on the lines of the one passed by Karnataka on Cauvery river water issue through which the state refused to release water to Tamil Nadu despite apex court directions.
 
 “Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has been championing the cause of river waters of Punjab. He had vowed to safeguard the interests of Punjab, now it would be his litmus test. At the same time, the SAD-BJP are in power in the Centre and Harsimrat Kaur Badal is a Union minister. It is also their responsibility get a solution in favour of the state,” Khaira said. 
 
 He said the SC decision was on the expected lines and the Punjab government would have to take a clear stand on the issue as the state had no water to share. 
 
 Citing the Cauvery water dispute, Bholath MLA Khaira said notwithstanding SC directions to Karnataka to release water for Tamil Nadu, the former had refused and passed a unanimous resolution in the state assembly. “Similarly, Punjab can defend its rights on the its river waters under constitutional provisions when the state has not even enough water for its own needs and water is a state subject,” he added.
