Vadodara: A taluka development officer and an accountant of the Fatepura taluka in Dahod district were booked in connection with a scam in the Indira Aavas Yojana (IAY) in the taluka. The duo had allegedly swindled money amounting to Rs 75.5lakh over the last couple of months.

 The District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) and panchayat officials in Dahod were probing alleged irregularities in Indira Aavas Yojana (IAY) at Fatehura taluka in the district since April. This was done after it came to light that aid under the housing scheme was given to 163 persons who had never applied for it.
 
 The alleged scam was conducted after a grant under the IAY was disbursed earlier this year. The grant was for applications that were made when the IAY was still under implementation. The scheme was scrapped in 2016.
 
 The 163 dubious beneficiaries were given aid from the grant that should ideally have been distributed to beneficiaries of the year 2013-14 who had applied when the scheme was still in force. 
 
 It came to light that grants were disbursed in the name of beneficiaries from Balaiya, Bhichor, Dhanikhut, Havesi, Makwanana Varuna, Hindolia, Kanthagar, Kundla, Morgala, Motirel, Nani Dhadheli, Nindka and Vakaner villages.
 
 The offence alleges that the scam was conducted by   Ramesh Rohit and taluka panchayat deputy accountant Vimal Charpot. 
 
 It is said that both Rohit and Charpot used their digital signatures to swindle the money. No records of the beneficiaries were maintained by the accused.
