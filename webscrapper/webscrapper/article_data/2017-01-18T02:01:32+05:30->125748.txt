Pune: ‘Archi’ and ‘Parshya’— the lead pair of Marathi film ‘Sairat’ that raked in more than Rs 90 crore last year—will be back together, not for a film, but as brand ambassadors of the Election Commission.

 Actors Akash Thosar and Rinku Rajguru will be seen together again in photos and banners across the state, spreading the message to vote in the upcoming elections. The state lags in youth-voter registeration and voting, with only 1.1% of the total 3% youth population participating in the process in the state. This prompted the EC to instruct the state to focus on “empowerment of youth and future youth voters”. “We approached director Nagraj Manjule’s team and they agreed to make the two brand ambassadors,” said Shirish Mohod, deputy chief electoral officer Maharashtra
 
 The state has 8.34 crore voters of which 12.16 lakh are registered young voters. While EC officials said enrolment improved over the years, there is still a long way to go.
