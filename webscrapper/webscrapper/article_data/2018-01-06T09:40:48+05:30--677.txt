ROHTAK/CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government had in November last year given a fresh twist to the debate over cows in the country when it had gifted bovines to six women boxers who had won medals at a national championship. But the move has backfired with three of them returning the cows, saying they kick and don't give milk.

 "My mother served the cow for good five days. Forget giving us milk, the animal hit her thrice. In fact, my mother suffered a damaged ligament after being kicked by the cow and we immediately returned the gift," said one of the boxers,  , from Rohtak. "We are happy with our buffaloes," she added.
 
 The women had won medals at senior national boxing championship held in Guwahati between November 19 and 26. Among the boxers,   and   from Bhiwani and Jyoti and   from Hisar had won gold medals in their respective categories. Anupama from   and Neha from Kaithal had won bronze medals. However, so far, Jyoti, Neetu and Sakshi have returned the cows saying they do not give milk and have hurt their family members with their horns. Jyoti's coach   said cows of a local breed were given to the boxers.
