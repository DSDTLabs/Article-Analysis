M A Nishad's multi-starrer bilingual 'Kinar,' which discusses water issue, has veteran actresses   and Revathy in the lead roles.

 Both the actors showcase exemplary performance in the film's recently released trailer, which gives a glimpse into a story that divides Kerala and Tamil Nadu. While Jaya Prada plays the role of a housewife, Revathy plays the Thirunelveli Collector. 
 
  The movie is set on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border. It also stars Tamil actor Pashupathi, who plays Shaktivel, a panchayat president. Archana, Indrans, Joy Mathew and Bhagat Manuel play the other important roles. The film had also recently been in news for bringing together Yesudas and S P Balasubhramaniam for a song, after a gap of 27 years.
