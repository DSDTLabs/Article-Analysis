Directed by Pa Ranjith, ‘Kaala’ has an ensemble cast including Nana Patekar, Huma Qureshi, Eswari Rao and   in important roles.
 
 Reports also suggest that the highly anticipated ‘2.0’, which is in its post-production stage, is likely to release by the end of this year.
 
 On the work front, Rajinikanth is teaming up with young filmmaker Karthik Subbaraj for a massive project, which will be produced by Sun Pictures. On Thursday, it was finally announced that   will play a pivotal role in the film.
