Bathinda: A state-level commemoration function will be organised at Shahidi Samark at Hussainiwala near the India-Pakistan border in Ferozpur district on March 23 to offer tributes to martyr Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev on their 86th martyrdom day. 

 Fazilka police have decided to hold 120km bicycle rally on the occasion.
 
 On March 23, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reached Hussainiwala to pay tributes to the martyrs. On the occasion, locals had asked PM Modi to take up issue with his counterpart in Pakistan to open the Hussainiwala border for trade purposes. 
 
 “The bicycle rally will start from the Martyrs’ Memorial at Asafwala village near Sulemanki on the India-Pakistan border in Fazilka district on the morning of March 22 and reach Hussainiwala on March 23,” said Fazilka senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ketal Baliram Patil.
 
 Around 1,000 students, police personnel and residents of Fazilka will participate in the cycle rally. The cyclists will offer floral tributes to the martyrs. SSP Patil said the initiative was also aimed at connecting youth through cycling.
 
 Ferozepur deputy commissioner Balwinder Singh Dhaliwal said programmes would be organised on the martyrdom day to a inculcate sense of patriotism among masses.
