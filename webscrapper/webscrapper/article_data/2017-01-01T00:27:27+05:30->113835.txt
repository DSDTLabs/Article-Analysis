 Kale green curtains, velvety sofas, one wall in flame colour for vibrance – these are trends backed by Pantone’s 2017 colour trend predictions. The forecast for 2017 is about how kale and flame will rule people’s décor tastes. Kale is ‘oxygenating,’ like a breath of fresh air with its greenness. The world of décor is taking the   further by having vertical gardens, rooftop greenery and leafy spaces. Flame looks royal in bedrooms and living rooms for bright, sunlit happy interiors.
  
  
 
  Think Monet’s Blue Water Lilies or Georgia O’Keeffe’s Oriental Poppies. Floral wallpapers are in vogue in 2017, in different textures. Instagram has a variety of stunning large-format florals adorning living rooms and beyond.
  
  
 
  The earthy terracotta is set to become one of the most popular materials of 2017. It’s great for commercial spaces and homes as it adds warmth to the surroundings. Terracotta bricks add an earthy uniqueness to your home. They are versatile too. You can use terracotta tiles anywhere – be it floors or walls.
