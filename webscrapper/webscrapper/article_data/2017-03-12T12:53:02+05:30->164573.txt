 The victory is such that I am unable to digest it. Two of our candidates (MGP) lost the elections and that has saddened me. So, it is a mixed feeling of joy and disappointment. 
 
 
 
 
 It appears that issues of language (medium of instruction), Mundkar Act and Tenancy Act issues, didnâ€™t go down well with the electorate. 
 
 
 
 
 The outcome of this election is a result of the absence of the BJP-MGP alliance. This only helped   heavyweights make a comeback. Had there been an alliance, at least six seats would have been added to the tally. 
 
 
 
 
  No decision has been taken yet in that regard.
