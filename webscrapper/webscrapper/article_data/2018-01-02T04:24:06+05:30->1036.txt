JAIPUR: Are you curious to discover the science behind unresolved mysteries of the universe or looking for a permanent solution to disorders and illnesses like diabetes, blood pressure or cancer? Well, the ‘Vedas’ could show you the way. Proposed in 2005, the Rajasthan government’s research institute to study the science of ancient Hindu texts, the first-of-its 

 kind in India, is all set become operational soon. On Monday, the Research Institute of Mantra Sciences (RIMS) or the Rajasthan Mantra Pratishtan, under the Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Rajasthan Sa- nskrit University (JRRSU), called for applications from eligible candidates for various posts, including that of teachers. Ghanshyam  , then education minister, had proposed the institute in 2005. 
 
 While presenting the concept, inspired by ‘Manusmriti’, the ancient Hindu book of law, Tiwari had quoted a verse from the text, ‘Sarvam vedaat prasiddhyati’ (Every solution lies in Vedas), in the state assembly. 
 
 The idea caught second wind in 2015-16 when the   government earmarked Rs 24 crore to construct the building for the institute in the JRRSU campus. The recruitment process has now begun and academics are hoping that the institute would become functional in 2018. 
 
 Jaya Dava, a patron of RIMS and the chairperson of Rajasthan Sanskrit Academy, said the institute intends to reclaim and revive the lost ancient knowledge of ‘Bharat’. Outlining the objectives of the institute, she said, “Vedas, Upanishads, Aranyakas and other ancient texts have answers to all the questions of the universe. Primary research work will be done in the areas of Ayurveda, Dhanur Veda, Gandarva Veda and Shilpa Veda.”
