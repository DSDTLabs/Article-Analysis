HYDERABAD: The   ( ) might be relying on various initiatives and awareness campaigns to promote complete waste segregation in the city, but it seems like they are losing the battle against the issue. For instance, GHMC’s ambitious twobin waste segregation drive – launched over two years ago – has done little to change the situation.

 The GHMC, under the   initiative had distributed 44 lakh 12-litre twin garbage bins –   - to 22 lakh households and introduced 2,000 auto tippers in 2015 to encourage door-to-door collection of segregated waste.
 
 But segregation at source is yet to be adopted by majority of city folks.
 
 While residents blamed the absence of monitoring by officials, experts claimed lack of knowledge and awareness among citizens . “The two-bins were distributed but the garbage segregation was not successful in several localities. The initiative bore results where it had volunteers to inspect its implementation. In our locality too, we started with much fanfare, but the efforts lost steam as a few continued the practice.” said  , waste management activist.
 
 A closer check revealed that in many areas people were unaware about waste segregation, thus disposing dry and wet waste together. Others were unaware about the use of two dustbins thus putting the ‘extra’ bin to other purpose.
 
 Officials, however, rely on data and claim it to be a successful move. “We have records and the segregation is being done completely. There has been a success rate of 80% in waste segregation.”
