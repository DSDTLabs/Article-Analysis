BHOPAL: A day after Madhya Pradesh chief minister   announced the relaxation of retirement age to 62 years from 60 years for all state government employees, an ordinance was promulgated in this regard on Saturday evening. The order came as a sweet surprise for 1,500 employees who were to retire on Saturday itself.

 JP Raghuvanshi was one such employee who is an assistant grade 3 in the mining department at the state secretariat. “I have decided to surrender the government accommodation and got my train reservation done to go back to my hometown in Katni, but on Saturday afternoon just before the farewell, one of my seniors called me and said the retirement age has been increased to 62 years”.
 
 There are around 4 lakh regular or permanent employees in the state government. The move is seen as a major sop given to state government employees ahead of the assembly polls in November this year.
 
 There was also a sense of confusion among employees in the secretariat throughout the day. A number of employees felt that orders would come into effect from April 1, but the ordinance was promulgated on Saturday itself.
 
 The move would also ease the financially-stressed state government. Around 30,000 employees were set to retire in the next two years. This would have cost the state ex-chequer around Rs 6,600 crore for doling out retirement benefits, but by increasing the retirement age, the government will be saving a lot of money for the time being.
 
 Mantralaya Employees’ Union president Sudhir Nayak said he whole-heartedly welcomed the move of the state government, but also pointed out that in a number of departments and for class four employees, the retirement age is already 62 years and 65 years respectively.
