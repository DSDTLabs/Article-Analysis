LUCKNOW: The Yogi government’s second budget will be keenly watched by financial as well as political experts as it will reveal the roadmap of development in the state during the financial year 2018-19 and would also make a big impact on the   elections due next year.

 The budget assumes significance as development, job creation and public expenditure in the state in next financial will build public opinion and prepare the base for BJP’s show in the 2019 general elections.
 
 The budget session will commence with Governor Ram Naik’s address to the joint session of the House on February 8.
 
 Chief minister   has announced new   projects and the budget will reveal the priority he gives them. The CM would have to allocate funds for Poorvanchal Expressway project.
 
 The budget would be crucial as public expectations are high and they want it to trigger a spurt in economic activities besides providing respite to farmers who are in distress.
 
 Moreover, since the government has declared 2018 as the year of empowerment of youth, budgetary provisions would be required to fulfill commitments for job creation, education, health, startups, and sports.
 
 The   government could not make much headway in development in the current financial year owing to financial constraints due to the Rs 38,000 crore expenditure on waiver of loans to farmers.
 
 The loan waiver had a big impact because of which no new social welfare scheme could be launched and the annual budget of several departments was curtailed.
 
 The budget session would also be important for Speaker   who has warned the Opposition against creating ruckus in House.
