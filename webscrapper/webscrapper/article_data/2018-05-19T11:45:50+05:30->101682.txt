HOWRAH: A rebel   has prevented the party from a clean sweep in the 40-member Howrah zilla parishad, alleged a contestant, Kalyan Ghosh. 

 Ghosh, who has never lost a civic body election since 1990, was defeated by Jamaluddin Mullick. Ghosh, a heavyweight, was also an office-bearer in the outgoing zilla parishad.   has won 39 seats in the Howrah ZP and Mullick, an Independent candidate, won the only other seat. 
 
 Ghosh blamed his upset on state minister and Domjur MLA Rajeev Banerjee, claiming he wasn't even allowed to step out of his home on counting day. Banerjee, however, claimed he was being victimized. 
 
 Ghosh's political mentor, minister Arup Ray said, "The loss of an official Trinamool candidate cannot be accepted."
