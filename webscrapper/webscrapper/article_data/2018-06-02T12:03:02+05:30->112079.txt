INDORE: Two unidentified men robbed a trader of Rs 7.74 lakh at a secluded road in   market in Ujjain on Friday afternoon. 

 The victim Fazil Ahmed, son of Shakil Ahmed, 55, resident of Teliwada, was on his way to the bank to deposit the amount when two bike-borne masked men approached him and robbed him of the cash. 
 
 They reportedly first kicked the scooter that Pankaj was driving, snatched the bag from him and fled the spot. The accused were riding a black bike without a registration plate and had covered their faces with handkerchiefs, said   police. Fazil told police that he followed the accused for over a kilometer but they fled towards Agar Road. 
 
 Fazil is brother of Aamir Ali, a contractor with an agency hired by discom. Aamir handles four counters of the bill payment department and he had given money to his brother to deposit in the bank after a bank strike of two days. 
 
 He told police that he usually gives some part of the cash to discom and remaining amount is deposited in the bank at Budhwariya market. Because of the strike, he had a large amount of cash and so sent his brother for the work.
 
 Kotwali police were informed and teams were constituted to nab the accused. The police teams took out   footages of the area where the incident took place.
 
 "We are also examining CCTV footages of the entire market area to ascertain the identity of the accused," said investigating officer KK Choubey, Kotwali police station in-charge. 
 
 "Investigation is in progress and we are hopeful of cracking the case in next couple of days," said Choubey.
