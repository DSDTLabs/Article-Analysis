CHENNAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached nine properties worth 27 crore of R   of   under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The properties acquired were proceeds of crime,   said. This takes the total attachment in the case to 68 crore. 

 The Tamil Nadu police had earlier booked Reddy in three cases pertaining to cheating, impersonation, selling of vacant plots by creating forged death certificate, fake seal of corporation and signatures, fake sale deeds and fabricated documents. Chargesheets were also filed by the police. ED has also registered a case as it comes under the scheduled offences under the PMLA. 
 
 ED's investigation has found that using proceeds of crime, Devadoss acquired nine immovable properties worth Rs 27 crore in his wife Bhanumathi and late son Vinoth Kumar's name in Vallur village, Chennai. "ED has reasonable belief that the properties are proceeds of crime and hence have been attached," a release stated.
 
 Sources said that Devadoss had allegedly cheated government companies like   (IOC) by taking their land by resorting to forgery.
 
 Earlier, 46 properties worth Rs 41.48 crore bought from proceeds of crime in this case were provisionally attached.
