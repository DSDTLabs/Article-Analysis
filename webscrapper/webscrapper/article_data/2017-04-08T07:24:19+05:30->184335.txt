AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Friday ordered the city   to investigate into the scam by which prisoners and their relatives supply bogus   to secure  .

 Justice ZK Saiyed has ordered the JCP, crime branch to depute an inspector, who will probe the “serious case” of procuring or forging medical papers of the Civil Hospital and VS Hospital. The investigation will take place under the supervision of an assistant commissioner of police. The probe report would be submitted to the high court.
 
 This happened after the HC suspected scam last year while dealing with temporary bail plea filed by six prisoners. It ordered its vigilance department to conduct an inquiry, which revealed that the malpractice took place in 97 bail applications. When cross-checked authorities in the Civil Hospital and VS Hospital said that the documents supplied to the HC by the prisoners were not prepared by them.
 
 After going through the inquiry report, the HC said that such tactics for obtaining bail cannot be tolerated. “This kind of acts are very serious in nature and required to be deprecated so that in future none can dare to create such type of fake and fabricated documents for production for getting temporary bail.”
 
 The HC further said that such prisoners obtain temporary bail and then jumped bail and parole. To bring them back, special squad had to be created on court orders.
