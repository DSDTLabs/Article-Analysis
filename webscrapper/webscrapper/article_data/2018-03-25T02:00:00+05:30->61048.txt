PATNA: Ashiana Nagar Theosophical Lodge (ATL) members on Saturday brought smile to the faces of inmates of ‘Vriddhashram’, an   in Mangalam Bihar Colony at Ara Garden Complex, as they distributed bed sheets and fresh fruits among them.

 The old-age home, run by Sarvangin Vikas Samiti, houses 25 inmates. “At times, family members take inmates back to their home. At other times, this is where they end up,” ATL president Atul K Varma said and added governments needed to look after elderly members of our society.
 
 Varma said the purpose of their visit was to ascertain if the inmates were properly looked after. “Based on the feedback we received today, ATL will contribute clothes, bed sheets, utensils and furniture to the old-age home soon,” he said.
 
 ATL, a charity organisation mostly of senior citizens, has also erected a ‘Neki ki Deewar’, or wall of kindness, at Abhiyanta Nagar in Ashiana. The wall made of bamboo has clothes hanging on it for the poor to choose from them as per their need without anyone noticing them.
