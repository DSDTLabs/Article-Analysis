The   government has written to Army headquarters seeking details of the expenses incurred on deployment of troops in the state in the wake of the violence that erupted following the conviction of Dera Sacha Sauda head   in rape cases on August 25. Few columns of the Army had to be deployed in Punjab, especially in Bathinda and Patiala districts, to avert any trouble.

 As many as 36 people were killed and more than 250 injured in clashes between dera followers and security forces in the massive post-conviction violence. There were nearly 300 incidents of violence reported from across Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh.
 
 The state government has sought these details to quantify the expenses incurred in maintaining law and order in the state during that period. 
 
 A letter in this regard has been written by the director general of police (law and order) to the director, military operations, New Delhi. 
 
 The Punjab government has claimed that an amount of around Rs 169 crore as `policing expenses' has been incurred in handling the dera violence. 
 
 This amount was spent on deployment of paramilitary forces, hiring of vehicles, salaries on deployment of Punjab police and expenses on accommodation of forces and cost of packaged food and drinking water supplied to the forces at the time of deployment.
 
 A total of 85 companies of paramilitary forces were deployed in Punjab from August 21-31to maintain the law and order situation. A detailed report about these expenses was submitted to the Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday by the Punjab advocate general (AG) Atul   during the hearing of a petition on the issue.
 
  Nanda also submitted that government property worth Rs 1.28 crore was damaged and Rs 38 lakh was destroyed during the violence.
 
 The HC, however, has already ordered that the claims for loss of properties shall be decided by tribunals and the issue about recovery of such losses from the   dera shall be decided separately by it.
