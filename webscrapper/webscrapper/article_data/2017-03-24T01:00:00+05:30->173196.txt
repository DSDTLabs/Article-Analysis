Age or stature is no bar when it comes to learning — this is one philosophy that music director   swears by. The '  2:  ' composer is learning   and says he plans to use the ancient instrument in his upcoming films.

 “Almost 15 years ago, I learnt tarshenai from my guruji (late  ) for two years. He had created his own version of the instrument by converting a dilruba,” he says. 
 
 Tarshenai is a bowed instrument and has an uncanny resemblance to sarangi and dilruba. Says Mannan, “We use a metal horn in the soundboard to produce sound. This instrument is an integral part of the Indian classical and folk music scene in Punjab and Kolkata.”
