NAGPUR: Municipal commissioner   will present the   Corporation’s ( ) budget for 2018-19 in last week this month. He will also present revised budget for 2017-18 and likely to impose cut on expenses due to less revenue in last 10 months.

 Mudgal sent a letter to standing committee chairman Sandip   on Saturday requesting him to hold meeting for presenting the budget. Jadhav is likely to hold the meeting between February 26 and 28.
 
 Civic chief is supposed to present budget before February 15. But the process has been delayed this year. Taking the base of civic chief’s budget, standing committee chairman will present budget in April or May. Civic chief’s budget will come into effect from April 1 and to be replaced with standing committee’s budget whenever the latter is presented.
 
 Civic chief had presented budget of Rs 1,707.80 crore for 2017-18 and standing committee fuelled it to Rs 2,271.97 crore. However, the NMC is likely to miss the revenue target by a great extent. As on January 31, the NMC could get revenue of Rs 875 crore. Therefore, Mudgal is likely to impose cut in budget that will hamper many works.
