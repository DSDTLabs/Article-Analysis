MUMBAI: Stations on the Neral-Matheran section have turned green as   has stated harnessing power from solar and wind.

 The Neral-Matheran rail section is spread over a distance of 21 km cutting a swathe through forests in the Western Ghats from Neral to Matheran.
 
 The narrow gauge railway line halts at three stations along the stretch—Jummapatti, Waterpipe, Aman Lodge—and terminates at Matheran.
 
 Central Railway’s chief public relations officer   said, “All these four stations are now provided with solar power plant of capacity 500-1,000 Watt peak capacity and wind Mill of capacity 6.1 Kilo Watt peak at Matheran including energy-efficient LED lights and fans.”
 
 On installation of green energy system, generation capacity of each system at Jummapatti, Waterpipe, Aman Lodge is 75-80 Kilo Watt and Matheran is 680-690 Kilo Watt per month.
 
 Udasi said, “The electric supply from the renewable sources will bring down the hill railway station’s power bill drastically, resulting in savings of Rs 2.07 lakh per year, besides reducing its carbon footprints.”
 
  station was the first to be made fully operational on the green initiative. Central Railway has installed a 10 Kilo Watt solar plant and a six Kilo Watt wind energy plant at Asangaon station.
