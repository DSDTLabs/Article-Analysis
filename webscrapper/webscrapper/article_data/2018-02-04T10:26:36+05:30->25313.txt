 Vinayak Kurubar, member of Alnavar town panchayat in Alnavar, Dharwad taluk, took the dog’s body to the hospital and kept it in front of the doctor’s chamber. Then, he called a group of bhajan singers who came with their instruments and started singing bhajans at the hospital.
 
 Normally, bhajans are organized in front of the house of a deceased person before the funeral takes place. A group of professional singers do the job for a fixed fee and tips.
 
 Vinayak said when Danny, the Rottweiler was ill, he took him to the local veterinary hospital. However, there was no response from the staff to his pleas to treat the dog. The dog died on Friday evening. Refusing to perform the last rites without a protest, Vinayak resorted to bhajans.
 
 However, district veterinary officer Dr Vishal Adahallikar arrived at Alnavar and talked to Vinayak. He assured that the postmortem of the dog would be conducted to ascertain the cause of death and if found guilty of negligence, action would be taken against the staff. Satisfied with this, Vinayak took the body away and performed the last rites on his farm.
