 "Those behind this heinous crime should be dealt with, without any delay," Sharif ordered Federal Interior Minister Chaudhary Nisar Ali Khan.

 Sharif also said that accountability of those who misuse the blasphemy law for their personal interests should be ensured.
 
 He also asked the relevant departments to approach international social media platforms to put the blasphemous content off the internet.
 
 Meanwhile,   on Tuesday passed a unanimous resolution condemning the sacrilegious contents appearing on social media and agreed to constitute a ten-member committee to monitor such content.
 
 The lower house also agreed that, if required, the government should take legislative action against those posting blasphemous content on social media.
 
 The resolution said that the "objectionable material is hurting the sentiments of the Muslims."
 
 The House adopted a motion authorising Speaker National Assembly to constitute a ten-member special committee to suggest measures for blocking the sacrilegious and blasphemous material on social media and action against the responsible persons for this crime.
 
 Blasphemy is very sensitive issue in Pakistan and those accused of it become an easy target for extremists.
