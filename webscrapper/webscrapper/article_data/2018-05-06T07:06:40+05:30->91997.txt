They also had the opportunity to converse with the settlers to know more about the forests. People who fancy taking a swim could do so in the waters at the dam. They were taken to the old dam as well as the adjoining areas. The facility for boating through Periyar was also arranged,” said an official. After lunch, the tourists were taken to Thattekkadu bird sanctuary where they spent the evening watching birds. The tour ended by 7 in the evening.
