GURUGRAM: For the first time in the district, the General   in Sector 10 will offer cardiology treatment, including   with drug-eluting stent, to patients at an affordable rate. 

 Being started under the public private partnership (PPP) model, the facility will be free for patients belonging to below poverty line (BPL) families.
 
 On Tuesday, the state health department signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Kerala-based Meditrina Hospital to set up a catheterization laboratory (also known as cath lab) at the hospital. 
 
 Dr BK Rajora, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurgaon told TOI, “We have signed the MoU and the facility will begin next month. The cath lab will provide all cardiology treatments at affordable rates. Patients will have to pay 50% of what they pay at CGHS-empanelled hospitals for an   package, including drug-eluting stent.” 
 
 Till now, patients had to travel to Rohtak to get angiography and angioplasty procedures done at a reasonable rate. Only private hospitals in the city had this treatment available but the costs are high.
 
 Almost two years ago, the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government had announced setting up of cath labs in district hospitals across the state so that patients suffering from heart ailments don’t have to travel far for affordable healthcare. The setting up of a cath lab in the   seems to be the first step in this direction.
