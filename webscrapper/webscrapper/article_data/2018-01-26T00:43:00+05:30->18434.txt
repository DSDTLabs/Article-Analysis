Coimbatore: Sugar prices have come down during December-January following the entry of fresh sugar in the 2017-18 season (October-September), and in anticipation of higher production. Sugar prices (ex-mill Uttar Pradesh) declined to Rs 33,000-Rs 33,500 per tonne in January from Rs 36,000-Rs 36,500 in November. They were ruling at Rs 37,000-Rs 37,500 per tonne in September-October last year.

 “Based on the current cane-crushing trends, we estimate domestic sugar production at around 26 million MT (metric tonnes) against an earlier estimate of 25 million MT in December 2017,” said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior vice-president & group head, ICRA Ratings.
 
 “This will translate into an increase in sugar production by 28% in SY (sugar year) 2018 from 20.3 million MT in SY 2017, mainly driven by an expected recovery in production in the key sugar-producing states Maharashtra and Karnataka, supported by relatively better monsoons during 2016 and 2017,” he said.
 
 “Further, sugar production in Uttar Pradesh is also expected to touch an all-time high of around 10.2 million MT in SY 2018, supported by higher acreage and better cane variety, resulting in higher yields and recovery rates,” Majumdar added.
 
 “Upward revision in sugar production estimate along with most mills liquidating the produce to repay cane payments resulted in correction in sugar prices in January,” he said. 
 
 While short-term pressure is likely to remain on sugar prices during this quarter, ICRA anticipates prices to stabilise in the coming quarter, although at somewhat lower levels than those anticipated earlier. Closing stocks are likely to remain comfortable at around 5-5.5 million MT, the agency said.
