BENGALURU: Commuting is a daily nightmare for residents of  ,   and localities around Lavelle Road,   and Residency Road. The day-long traffic congestion on roads snaking through these localities is worsened by private vehicles parked outside schools dotting the areas. 

  Residents and school van drivers met on Friday to find a solution. Shanmugam PS, president of the Karnataka United School and Light Motor Drivers' Union, said van drivers are open to any suggestion that wouldn't hit their earnings and compromise the safety of children. The area has nearly one-and-a-half dozen schools. 
 
  "Vans aren't permitted to enter the school premises. Therefore, we don't have any option but to park along the roadside," said Shanmugam. 
 
 The drivers are responsible for picking up children from their classrooms and dropping them off at their homes. A few van drivers felt private cars ferrying single students are the ones to blame for the chaos.
 
 One of the clauses of the Karnataka Motor Vehicles (conditions for vehicles engaged in transport of schoolchildren) Act 2012, says the regional transport authority, along with traffic police and the municipal corporation, should specify parking and halting places exclusively for school cabs. Residents, however, said nothing has been done in this regard.
 
 In October/November 2016, following a meeting of representatives from schools located in the CBD with traffic police, schools were asked to take up measures to help ease congestion. These included increasing the number of security guards outside schools, giving loudspeakers to guards to manage traffic easily, and ensuring parents followed road rules. "None of these were implemented," said a resident.
 
  Residents felt traffic flow will be smoother if vans are allowed inside school premises. They said schools are running beyond their capacity and the roads aren't able to deal with the growing traffic.
