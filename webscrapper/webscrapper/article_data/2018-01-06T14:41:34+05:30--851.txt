NEW DELHI: US President  , in what else but a tweet, called the 
  on him "a total loser".

 
 
 No matter, the author,  , is laughing all the way to the bank - his book on Trump, ' : Inside the Trump  ', went on sale yesterday and is already in the top spot on Amazon's and others' lists of best-selling books.
 
 "Michael Wolff is a total loser who made up stories in order to sell this really boring and untruthful book," tweeted Trump late yesterday US time. 
 
 In his tweet, Trump also targeted his one-time pal   - he called him "sloppy" - whom he unceremoniously dumped from his position as White House strategist in August, almost exactly a year after hiring him. 
 
  
  
 
 Trump believes Wolff used Bannon as a main source for his book that says, among other things, that the US President is unfit for office and likely has mental health issues.
 
 "He (Wolff) used Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!", tweeted Trump.
  
  
 On the US TV channel NBC's show, 'Today', this is what Wolff had to say: 
 
 "I will quote Steve Bannon. 'He's (Trump's) lost it.'"
 
 Trump attacked Wolff - in a tweet - a day before the latter's book was released as well.
