DEHRADUN: The   have warned of necessary action, including  , if firearm owners failed to deposit their weapons either with them or  .
 
  The warning came after only 40% of owners deposited their weapons since the imposition of the model code of conduct on January 5, even as less than a month to go for the assembly elections.
  
  Inspector general of police (law and order)-cum-election nodal officer Deepam Seth said, “Of around 40,000 licenced weapons in the state, nearly 16,000 have been deposited in the last 10 days, and the process is still on. Besides, instructions have been issued to district police officers to ensure that all licenced weapons are deposited without any delay.”
  
  “The final review of the number of weapons surrendered would be done before the elections and necessary action would be taken against those who fail to adhere to Election Commission’s directions. “Those who don’t abide by the EC order, police would be forced to initiate licence cancellation process against them,” Seth told TOI.
  
  However, the IG said, the licenced weapon holders having genuine threat to their lives could approach a district-level committee with a request to exempt them from surrendering their weapons during the polls. “The committee can take a call in such cases and allow a person to keep his weapon,” said Seth.
  
  Out of the total deposited weapons so far, maximum 3,800 weapons have been surrendered in   district, followed by Haridwar 3,700, Dehradun 2,800 and Nainital 1,200.
