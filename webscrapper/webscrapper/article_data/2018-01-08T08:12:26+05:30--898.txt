HYDERABAD: A day after   police station in Hyderabad was crowned the second best in India, controversy raged over non-registration of a   despite a court directive. The issue came up before the newly set up central monitoring cell ( ).

 A city   station did not register a court-referred case until the complainant approached the monitoring cell. While a key parameter of good policing is registering FIRs, the monitoring cell was set up last week to stop police reluctance to register cases.
 
 Citing various reasons and despite a court directive, the police officer did not register an FIR. Sources in Hyderabad police were unwilling to disclose the name of police station or the officer. Monitoring cell officials were forced to take up the issue with the concerned police station to get the FIR registered.
 
 On an average, at least three people approach the cell every day after police refuse to register FIRs. In some cases, it was found cops cite the matter as ‘civil’ in nature. “Based on complaints, we contacted the concerned station house officer (SHO) and he felt the issue was civil in nature. So, we asked the SHO to give in writing to the complainant that it’s a civil case,’’ a police officer told TOI.
 
 In case of economic transactions, a police officer need not directly register a FIR and can first do a preliminary inquiry if the SHO is convinced it’s a cognizable offence. Some even approached the cell as they were unhappy with police registering a petty case and not desired sections.
 
 Before the monitoring cell was set up, the complainant had the option of either approaching senior police officers or going to court if the SHO refuses to register a case. Non-registration of FIRs, unlike in the past, has come down in all three commissionerates, but aberrations happen. The CMC model is yet to be replicated in   and Rachakonda commissionerates.
