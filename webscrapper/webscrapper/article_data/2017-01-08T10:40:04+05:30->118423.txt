MARGAO: Alleging that ‘the electoral rolls had been rigged, with 53 voters shifted from the Curtorim constituency to Fatorda constituency without the voters shifting their residence,’   ( ) on Saturday sought ‘a thorough inquiry into their complaint filed with the   (ECI), and strict action taken against officials involved in such illegalities. 
 
 GFP president Prabhakar Timble, along with general secretary  , told media that “the GFP has filed a complaint with the Chief Election Commissioner, State Chief Electoral Officer and District Electoral officer. A perusal of the 2017 electoral roll of Fatorda constituency shows that around 53 names of voters are deleted from the Curtorim constituency and shifted to Fatorda constituency. All these 53 voters whose names appeared in Curtorim constituency are listed under Fatorda after the revision of electoral rolls stating that the voters have shifted residence. But there are no records showing any change of residence on the electoral rolls. In fact, the house numbers of all the shifted voters are the same as earlier. More such illegalities and abuse of power by the officers involved in the election process cannot be ruled out in other constituencies.”
 
 Stating that GFP will represent all such cases as it amounts to rigging of elections from the roots, Lolienkar reiterated, “Glaring instances of rigging of electoral rolls have come to light, wherein voters are shifted from one constituency to another though they have not changed their residence. This could be just the tip of an iceberg of manipulation of electoral rolls, which cannot be possible without the connivance of government officers responsible for preparation of the rolls. The GFP is surprised and distressed that such rigging happens when the officials are working under the supervision and control of the ECI, which is a constitutional authority for the conduct of free and fair elections in the country.”
