NAVI MUMBAI: For nearly a week now, water has been gushing out at the Malwadi busstop site of Panvel-Matheran Road in New Panvel. The severe leakage has been caused due to a damage to an underground pipeline. 

 As the water is continuously jetting out of the pipe, it is spilling out on the busy main road and has formed a streamlet by the roadside.
 
 When TOI visited the spot, some of the local shopkeepers informed that the pipeline had been damaged last week due to a road-digging work that had taken place next to Malwadi bus stop, which is close to Akurli and in Sukapur section of Panvel taluka.
 
 “St Andrews educational institute along with the commercial shops and a dental clinic at Malwadi are utilising the water which comes from Ghadeshwar dam through this underground pipeline. However, the water officials from the municipality have not come to repair the line since the locals must not have formally intimated the authorities,” said a shopkeeper from the locality.
 
 When TOI contacted D R Alghat, from the Panvel City Municipal Corporation ( ) water department said, “Though it was not our resposibiity to fix the line, we did repair the line and stopped further wastage by Monday evening.”
 
 He also said that he became aware of the leakage issue after TOI questioned him about it. “If the local traders at the site had earlier informed the gram panchayat they could have inspected the site much earlier.”
 
 City based RTI activists have said that any wastage of water for even seven minutes is criminal waste of public money and resources. The civic officials must also regularly check the entire stretch of water lines, besides the information made available from the affected local residents and traders, they added.
