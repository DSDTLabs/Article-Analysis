KOLKATA:   on Wednesday raised questions about the impartiality of a   probe into the   sting after pointing out that police did not register any FIR under Section 154 CrPC initially despite going through the  .

 During the hearing of the case, in which a top police official and almost a dozen politicians were seen accepting cash to lobby for a fictitious company, acting chief justice Nishita Mhatre asked the state if a fair probe into the case is possible at all by a state agency when an IPS officer is involved in it. The judge said that the court is concerned whether any further investigation is required in the case.
 
 Appearing on behalf of accused IPS officer and then Burdwan SP SMH Mirza, advocate Kishore Dutta claimed that the forensic laboratory report does not have any evidentiary value. He further argued that the court cannot entertain such a petition as the PIL does not comply with any form of the PILs. Matthew Samuel has reportedly informed the court that when he was looking for ways to meet politicians, Tiger — a small time politician — suggested he meet Trinamool leaders through Mirza. 
 
 Samuel has allegedly told the court that he met Mukul Roy, Madan Mitra and Shankudeb Panda through Mirza. 
 
 Samuel has also informed the court that it was Iqbal Ahmed who helped him meet Subrata Mukherjee, Sovan Chatterjee, Firhad hakim, Sultan Ahmed and Suvendu Adhikari. Sultan Ahmed had later introduced him to Prasoon Banerjee, Saugata Roy and Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar.
 
 “I am appearing for the police officer against whom there is no evidence that he has asked for money,” Dutta told the court. When the judge said that the court will go through the entire footage, Dutta pleaded to do that in presence of all of the parties involved.
