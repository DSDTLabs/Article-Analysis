HYDERABAD: Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president   on Sunday demanded an unconditional apology from chief minister   for growing atrocities on Dalits in the state.

 He demanded an inquiry by a sitting high court judge into the `third degree torture' inflicted on eight Dalits of Nerella of Thangalappaly mandal in Sircilla district and immediate suspension of superintendent of police. Uttam said cases under section 307 of IPC and SC and ST Atrocities (Prevention) Act should be booked against all the police personnel involved in 'torturing' Dalits in the police custody . In a letter to the chief minister, Uttam said the police resorted to “barbaric assault“ on Dalits and described KCR's silence as shocking.
 
 The state government should withdraw the cases registered against the Dalits and stringent action against sand mafia ruling the roost in Rajanna-Sircilla and other districts.Action should also be taken against their political bosses,“ he demanded. “Hand-cuffing of farmers in Khammam district and the latest brutality on Dalits in police custody in Sircilla indicate that Dalits and tribals have no protection in the so called  ,“ Uttam said. “Why were the Dalits kept in illegal custody for 5 days before they were produced before the magistrate concerned?
 Your son and IT minister   is the MLA from Sircilla. Is it possible that Dalits were taken into illegal custody and tortured for 5 days without the knowledge of KTR? Whose instructions were the local SP and police officers following?“ the TPCC chief asked.
 
 Uttam also said one could not help but suspect that the SP and the local police officers were hand in glove with local sand mafia. “Who is running the sand mafia? Allegations are that they are your party leaders and some are your relatives.KTR tweets about everything in this world. But why is he silent on this horrific torture of poor Dalits?“ Uttam asked.
