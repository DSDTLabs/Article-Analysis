NEW DELHI: Hours after the Bollywood film industry erupted in a controversy over remarks by choreographer Saroj Khan on the prevalence of ‘casting couch’ in the film industry, former   MP and   leader   said casting couch was the “bitter truth” not only of Bollywood, but also of all work spaces, including the   of India. Chowdhury said, “It’s the bitter truth. It is not just in the film industry. This happens everywhere in work spaces.

 
 Don’t imagine that Parliament is immune or some other work space is immune. If you look at the Western world today, established top actresses took so long to come out and say ‘me too’. It’s time India stood up and said ‘me too’,” she said.
 
 Referring to the incident in Rajya Sabha, where PM Modi had commented on her laughter in the House, Chowdhury said, “Narendra Modi had snatched my dignity when he said I remind him of Surpanakha.
 
 Okay, I am Surpanakha and I do not want to become Sita,” she said. In Parliament, PM Modi had said, “Sabhapati ji, I request you not to say anything to Renuka ji. After the Ramayan serial, we have got the privilege of hearing this kind of laughter only today.”
