PANAJI: Seeking a second consecutive term, the state BJP leadership is all set to unleash its star campaigners ahead of the assembly elections on February 4. The party has announced that Prime Minister   will address a public meeting at Campal, Panaji, on January 28 to strengthen the saffron party’s support base.

 The party is contesting in 36 constituencies and is confident of winning at least 26 seats on its own. “The BJP will win the elections and form the next government on its own strength,” said state BJP general secretary Sadanand Tanawde.
 
 Besides Modi, home minister Rajnath Singh and BJP national president   will campaign in the state to ensure the saffron party’s victory. The campaign blitzkrieg will commence on January 22 with the arrival of Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu, who will address a youth rally in Mandrem.
 
 Union minister for road, transport, shipping and highways   and Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will also address multiple rallies in the state. The other BJP leaders who are expected to touch down in Goa for the BJP campaign juggernaut are Smriti Irani, Anant Kumar, Poonam Mahajan and BS Yeddyurappa.
 
 The BJP has already held workshops for constituency-level election management committees. Half-day workshops on social media and media management have also been held for local mandal committees.
