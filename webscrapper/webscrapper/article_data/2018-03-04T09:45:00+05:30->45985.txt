KOCHI: With CBSE and state board examinations around the corner, counselling centres have been receiving more phone calls from students. According to such centres, most students calling for their assistance suffer from anxiety about their   results and failure to focus on their preparation. 

 "Parents' support is crucial for students during exam time. Parents should not overburden their children with expectation. Due to pressure, many children run away from home. In most cases, a child's anxiety regarding their result is stemmed from their parent's reaction," said Nirish Anthony, district coordinator of Childline.
 
 Childline manages their on-phone counselling calls from their office in Chennai, which can be reached by calling 1098. 
 
 Nirish said that this year, there have been two incidents where Childline officials had to go personally to help resolve child's worries. 
 
 Meanwhile, the Institute of Mental Health & Neurosciences (Imhans), Kozhikode, that has also been running phone counselling for students this year, said that they have also been getting calls from students in Ernakulam. They can be reached by contacting 8156830510.
