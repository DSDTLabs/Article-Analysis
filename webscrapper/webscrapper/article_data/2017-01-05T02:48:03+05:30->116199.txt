NEW DELHI: More than two months after   began an internal   to find out whether its DIG-level officer and others tortured the former director general of corporate affairs B K   and his family members, as alleged by them in their suicide notes, the agency has sent its report to the National Human Rights Commission.

 CBI is tight-lipped whether the agency has found anything against its officers or they have been a clean chit.
 
 The fact-finding team of CBI had examined DIG Sanjeev Gautam, who has since been repatriated from the agency, and other officers to get to the truth of the allegations.
 
 CBI was looking at the human rights violations, pertaining to allegations of torture and whether the investigation against Bansal was being done in fair manner. 
 
 Sharing details of what happened between July 16 (when CBI arrested Bansal) and September 27 (when Bansal and his son hanged themselves), a senior CBI officer said that a day before committing suicide, the two had come to the CBI headquarters and handed over documents showing their undisclosed income (Income Tax certificate) as part of Income Tax departmentâ€™s declaration scheme.
 
 The documents suggested that on September 25 (two days before suicide), Bansal's son Yogesh had gone to the office of Principal Commissioner, Income Tax, to declare undisclosed assets worth Rs 2.38 crore while he was to pay balance tax of Rs 1.07 crore.
 
 Sources claimed Bansal was not called by anyone in the agency and he had come on his own to submit the documents in which his son had disclosed 47 bank accounts. He had disclosed Rs 65 lakh to the tax authorities.
