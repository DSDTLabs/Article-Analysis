NEW DELHI: The Delhi   on Friday was peeved that despite constant monitoring and directions, the AAP government and corporations have failed to check   in the capital.

 “For heaven’s sake, do your duty,” an upset bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar told both the authorities taking note of   cases reported in January.
 
 The court wondered if both the entities “have any sense of responsibility” when the government blamed the corporations for their inaction.
 
 “It is always you (the  ) versus the  , the corporations, some statutory authority. It has to be only versus? Can’t you work together,” the bench said, pointing that instead of agencies doing their duty, the court has to actively monitor even waste management.
 
 “We do not want any mortality in Delhi due to vector-borne diseases. If not for our intervention, you (the government and corporations) were happy doing nothing. You need to look at reducing garbage generation, instead of more landfills sites. Else, soon Delhi will move out and only landfills will remain,” the bench said.
 
 It asked why dengue cases were being reported in January itself and said there was a need to address ‘this critical problem’ before it reaches ‘unmanageable proportions.’ 
 
 When the government complained of no information from the corporation about the locations from where the cases were reported, the bench said the government is yet to publicise the waste management bylaws that were framed on the court’s direction and notified recently. It then listed the matter for further hearing on February 27.
 
  HC was hearing two PILs filed by lawyers Arpit Bhargava and Gauri Grover seeking directions to the civic bodies and the other authorities to prevent spread of dengue, chikungunya and malaria.
