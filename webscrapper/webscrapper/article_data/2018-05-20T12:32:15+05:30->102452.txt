 are one of those   teams who have always preferred to keep their best for the last. The three-time IPL champions usually peak only when their qualification for the playoff stage is on the line. The 2014 edition comes to mind when they needed 190 to win in 14.3 overs in their last league match and Aditya Tare hit a six off the last ball to secure the playoff berth.

 
 The equation is pretty simple for MI - beat   on Sunday and progress into the playoffs without worrying about the net run-rate.
