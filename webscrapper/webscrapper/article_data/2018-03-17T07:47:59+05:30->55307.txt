NEW DELHI: Owing to  's blooper, the government quoted a wrong figure in the   on Wednesday when it claimed that 31 businessmen had fled the country after committing economic frauds.

 
 Replying to a question in Lok Sabha, the ministry of external affairs had given names of 31 persons, who had settled abroad, including  ,  ,  , Jatin Mehta, Sanjay Bhandari and others - and are wanted by   or the   (ED).
 
 The MEA also named Kolkata-based jeweller - Nilesh Parrekh, who cheated a consortium of 25 banks led by the State Bank of India of Rs 2,223 crore, as one of the businessmen "absconding abroad".
 
 However, it turns that Nilesh Parrekh was arrested by CBI on May 8, 2017 at Mumbai airport when he returned from Dubai.
 
 The central premier agency furnished wrong information in the parliament as Parrekh is still in India and is out on bail.
 
 CBI had registered a case against Nilesh Parrekh and his company Shri Ganesh Jewellery House in July 2016 after it was found that he had diverted money taken from the banks to Hong Kong, Singapore and the UAE.
 
 His company allegedly availed import finance from one member bank of the consortium for import of gold; but after manufacturing of gold jewellery, they were availing export finance from another member bank so that the proceeds of export could not be realised by the banks to pay off the liability of import finance, said a CBI officer.
 
 His brother Umesh Parrekh is also wanted by CBI and is untraceable. It is believed that Umesh Parrekh might be out of India, but Nilesh cannot travel out of the country.
 
 When asked about the blunder, a senior CBI officer said, "the branch handling the investigation had shared correct information with the (CBI) division which had to compile the data for sending to the government, however, later included Nilesh Parrekh's name in the list of fugitives".
 
 CBI is learnt to have again written to MEA accepting the gaffe and correcting the names in the 'absconding abroad' list.
