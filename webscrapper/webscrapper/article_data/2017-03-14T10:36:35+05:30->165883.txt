KOLKATA: The arrest of two persons — both   — on Friday has blown the lid off a racket in which promoters were extorted and   slapped on them.

 The promoters targeted were from the Mominpore-Ekbalpore and Kidderpore belt.
 
 The modus operandi, police said, is very intriguing. The two — identified as Asif Nomani and Mohd Mumtaz — have reportedly confessed to police they would approach promoters for “protection money.” The duo didn’t approach all the promoters. Instead, it kept a list of disputed properties which were paving way for standalone residential high-rises or were being bought by individual promoters to be developed into much bigger housing complexes.
 
 If the promoters refused to meet their demands, the duo would then move court with a petition seeking a civil injunction to halt further construction. Such a court order, sources said, would also be served on police. The duo then demanded the promoters coughed up more (than their original demands) to vacate the injunction in court.
 
 “When a promoter first approached us in November, we were apprehensive about the modus operandi. It is not common someone can be duped in such a manner. However, when we received a second complaint, we decided to act. It took us more than two weeks to mount vigilance and finally arrest them,” said DC (Port) Sudip Sarkar.
 
 Md Nahid, a local resident and relative of one of the accused, however, claimed: “The arrest is a hogwash. The two men were raising their voice against illegal construction in the area. Vested interests ensured they were arrested on frivolous charges.” The cops have refuted the charges.
 
 Police said that the probe is at a preliminary stage but didn’t rule out given the magnitude of the scam on whether a section of “influential” persons are involved.
