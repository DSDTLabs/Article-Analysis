HYDERABAD: Despite best efforts by chief minister  , the   has to clear many hurdles on its way.

 The projectâ€™s pipelines work need to be carried over 12,890 crossings on National Highway Roads, Roads and Building (R&B) department roads, canals and rivers, railway crossings and   roads to complete the works. Apart from these, the state is worried over taking over forest land as many pipelines pass through forest land.
 
 Sources said forest permissions are required to take over about 1,000 acres in 97 sub segments of Mission Bhagiratha scheme. But with various procedures involved in taking over forest land, only 21 sub-segments have got preliminary permissions. Incidentally of the 97 sub-segments, 22 fall inside wildlife areas. For other areas, land acquisition procedures for taking over 636 acres were completed.
 
  has taken up the ambitious project Mission Bhagiratha to provide tapped water supply to 24,248 habitations in the state. The scheme has already been operational in 605 habitations in Gajwel constituency since August, 2016.
 
 Recently Mission Bhagiratha vice-chairman Vemula Prashanth Reddy has directed the officials to complete the project by December this year and asked the officials to prepare a comprehensive action plan for internal pipeline works. He asked the daily progress reports on the project works.
 
 Official sources said while the required pipeline is 51,327 km, the government procured only 8900 km and laid 3124 km. The executing agencies are reportedly doing the works slowly as the government has not cleared bills for the agencies.
