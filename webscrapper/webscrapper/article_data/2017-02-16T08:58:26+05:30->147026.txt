GURUGRAM/CHANDIGARH: As many as 13   on   on   have been identified and blocked by the   of  . While six were removed on Wednesday, the remaining will be taken off on Thursday, police sources said.

 Also the leak of the   has become a bigger problem now as the forged version of the same is being circulated among protesters. TOI had on Wednesday reported about the report leak on social media hinting at the ongoing Jat agitation in the state turning violent after February 19.
 
 Sources said the cyber crime branch has already acquired from YouTube the URLs and IP addresses of those who had uploaded the inflammatory videos on the file-sharing website. “We will forward the same to police chiefs of the districts concerned to track down the miscreants,” sources said.
 
 Meanwhile, the state’s CB-CID is worried about the forged version of the leaked intelligence report, which contains inflated figures of demonstrators at the sit-in sites across the state.
 
 CB-CID sleuths believe the forged letter can aggravate tension as members of the community can consider this as a way to tarnish their image. “On the other hand, people of other communities who are not part of the agitation may feel scared hearing about the large number of protesters in their areas,” a senior police officer said.
 
 The original letter written by the state CID to all DGPs, additional DGP (law and order), district police chiefs and deputy commissioners (except Panchkula and Mewat) on February 12, and signed by SP (CID) Rakesh Arya, was leaked within 24 hours of it being sent.
 
 The letter says there is a rising dissatisfaction among the community members after their meeting with the government panel on February 11 did not yield the desired results. Not only this, the intelligence agencies fear the protests may turn violent after February 19.
 
 Notably, 30 people had died across the state after the quota stir turned violent, of these 19 were Jats who died in police firing on February 19, 2016.
