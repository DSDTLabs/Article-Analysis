CHANDIGARH: It took around six decades to change the perception towards asthma and inhalation therapy. 

 The areas of major concern included increased awareness about inhalation treatment (including non-sufferers) to overcome social stigma, the assurance that inhalation is safe and reliable, to establish asthma can be controlled and is not a hindrance in living a full life.
 
 The therapeutic revolution not only enhanced technology, but also influenced the lives of asthmatic patients. Modern devices have made it easy for patients to lead a normal and active life.
 
 Speaking on the challenges of disease management, Dr Meenu Singh, professor, pediatrics, PGIMER, said, "The key challenges in the management of asthma include improving compliance and developing effective and easy-to-use inhalers. Many patients frequently underutilise their medications or use their inhalers incorrectly, which can be detrimental to disease control. This can lead to oral therapy, which can be disastrous."
 
 Dr Kranti Garg, assistant professor, chest,  , said, "Today inhalation therapy is the mainstay of treatment for asthma. Inhaled medicines are integral to the management of  . They deliver drugs directly to the lungs and act faster and at a lower dose, thereby reducing the risk of side effects. Inhaled medications have been shown to improve disease status, control symptoms, reduce the number and severity of exacerbations and improve quality of life."
 
 The devices used to deliver medicines to the lungs are as important as the medicines themselves. The various inhaler devices available include the pressurized metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), dry powder inhalers (DPIs) and nebulisers.
