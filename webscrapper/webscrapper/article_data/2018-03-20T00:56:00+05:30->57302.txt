New Delhi: Two   were disappointed when they came to cremate two dead members of their families and found that the   ground has been   at Shahbad Daulatpur in   on Monday. Bawana   Ram Chander raised this issue in the Assembly on Monday to convey that the sealing of the crematorium has proved to be troublesome for locals.

 “At least five bodies are cremated at this facility every day. It is used by the locals from over a dozen villages nearby. Now, the people from these localities will have to travel long distances for cremation,” Chander said and pushed for the desealing of the crematorium. tnn
