The auditorium at Shilpakala Vedika buzzed with confidence, energy and high competitive spirit, as students from the   across Telangana and AP participated in one of the most awaited spell check competitions ' ', organised by the Narayana Group and OrientBlack Swan on Saturday. 

 Popular Indian cricket commentator and analyst   graced the occasion as the chief guest. The other dignitaries present at the event were MD of Narayana Group of Schools, Sindhura Narayana, ED Puneet Kothapa and head (academic operations) Pavan Kumar Samba. Krishna Dev Rao, director of OrientBlack Swan, was also present.
 
 More than one lakh students, from classes 4-9, participated in the competition, held in three levels. The top 10 participants were short-listed for the final round.
 
 Elevating the spirits of the students, Bhogle said, "Looking at these young students, takes me back to my childhood days. One thing that I would like to advise you all is not to worry too much if you haven't won everything in the world. Go ahead and build memories, compete hard but also have a fun in whatever you are doing. Everybody fails and everybody succeeds, it depends on what you focus on."
 
 Sindhura said, "The learning has to go beyond books and that's why we regularly organise co-curricular activities to showcase their talent. We give them a bigger platform, by holding inter-branch competitions through video-conferencing."
 
 Seconding that thought, Kothapa said how SpellBee is focused on teaching students the beauty of language. "The powers of auto-correct, spell-check and grammar correction in the different messaging apps are making students lose touch with language. It is important to know how a punctuation or apostrophe makes a difference in a sentence. Competitions like these teach the depth of English," he added.
