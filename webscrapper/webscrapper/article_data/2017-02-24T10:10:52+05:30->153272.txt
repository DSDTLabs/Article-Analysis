KORAPUT: Two hardcore women Maoists carrying cash reward of Rs 4 lakh each surrendered in   district on Thursday. 

 The surrendered Maoists have been identified as Sumitra Madvi, 35, alias Manila of village Simrikhal under Godchiroli district in Maharashtra and  , 33, alias Namita of Tekguda village in Malkangiri district, said police. 
 
 According to SP (Malkangiri) Mitrabhanu Mohapatra, Sumita joined the Maoist organisation in 2001 and was working as an area committee member (ACM) of the Andhra-Odisha border special zonal committee (AOBSZC). Sumitra was in our wanted list for her alleged involvement in seven murders and several Maoist offensives, including   mines attack in 2008 and five exchange of fire in Malkangiri district. Her involvement in other Maoist violence in the district is under investigation, the SP said. Police said Jagi was also an ACM with the AOBSZC and was wanted for her involvement in six murder cases from 2008-2017.
 
 After they realised that the Maoists do nothing for the tribals and poor except extorting money from traders and killing innocent people on false charges of being police informers, the duo decided to return to the mainstream, the SP said.
