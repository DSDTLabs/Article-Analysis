THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: National Commission for Women (NCW) member   has demanded the arrest of Lekshmi Nair, the former principal of The Kerala   Law College. She was speaking to reporters after collecting evidence from the students after the college reopened following a month-long students’ protest, on Monday.

 The NCW member, who spent around one-and-a-half hours inside the campus, collected evidence on the allegations of harassment and mistreatment by Nair. Sahu, who assured the students that she would raise the demand of Nair’s arrest before Thiruvananthapuram city police commissioner, later met the police officer to convey the demand.
 
 “Nair behaved like Hitler inside the campus. She mistreated girl students for interacting with boys,” said Sahu. She also said she would demand action against those who are portraying the student leaders who led the agitation in a bad light on social media.
 
 Meanwhile, city police commissioner G Sparjan Kumar said the arrest could be carried out only based on clear evidence and proper inquiry, “which is going on”.
 
 Meanwhile, the reopening day saw the students, happy and excited over their victory, singing songs and raising slogans against Lekshmi Nair, before proceeding to their classes. “We are happy that classes have resumed. Now, we have a campus as per our liking, where we can study and spend time,” said Arya V John, a student leader.
 
 The SFI, which had faced criticism for withdrawing from the agitation midway following an earlier agreement with the management, too celebrated the reopening with a separate parade inside the campus.Vice-principal Damodharan Potti was in charge as a new principal is yet to be appointed. The academy has notified for the appointment of a new principal after the governing council removed Nair from the post as per the agreement reached between the management and students on last Wednesday.
