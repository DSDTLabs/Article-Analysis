What do you get when two intensely passionate and talented people from different fields come together on stage — a performance that will leave you spellbound. That’s what happened when Indian Classical and fusion musician   and   actor-director   came together for ' ', a touching play about love, loss and longing. But unlike traditional theatre, in this experimental monologue, Makarand’s dialogues were complemented with Niladri’s haunting tunes, which he played on his famous ‘zitar’. 
Speaking on how the two of them decided to work together on this act, Niladri said, “I just wanted to watch the maverick at work from the best seats in the house for free! (laughs) But in all seriousness, I had once seen his play 'Karodo Mein Ek' and it left a lasting impression on me. I conveyed to him that I wanted to work with him and here we are.” Makarand adds that when he wrote the concept, for  , he could only think of Niladri. “I just gave him a one-line brief: 'Patni' is a story about a husband who wants to introduce his wife to his audience… but she is dead. It’s a story of how he cannot get over his loss. He understood what was needed and came up with ragas and sounds that were suitable for the play.” With Makarand known for his improvisational techniques on stage, Niladri too doesn’t mind performing a range of different tunes, making sure every show is a unique one.
