Pre-production for Sandip Ray’s Prof Shonku O El Dorado, based on Satyajit Ray’s   from the Shonku series, is on in full swing. Unlike what was thought earlier, the film is likely to start rolling in May and not June. Sandip Ray, who has cast   as the scientist, is busy finalising the locations in  , though a considerable part will be shot abroad. Among the names of places thrown up for the foreign shoot,   finds the most prominence. Prof Shonku is an eccentric scientist living in Giridih with his house help Prahlad and cat, Newton. Earlier in the year,   had clarified that the film — made on a big canvas — will not release this year.
