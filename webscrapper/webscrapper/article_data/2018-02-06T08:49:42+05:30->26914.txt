PURANDAR (PUNE):   of state for water resources and water conservation   on Monday said villagers losing land for the proposed airport at Purandar will get at least five times the value of their plots once the acquisition starts.

 Shivtare, who also represents Puarandar in the state Assembly, said the ongoing protests against the proposed airport was an attempt by the Congress “to play a spoilsport”. Accusing leaders of the protesting landowners of having vested interests, he told TOI, “I am sure that the land acquisition process will start soon and will be successful. The landowners will get the best possible amount for their plots.” 
 
 The Shiv Sena leader said, “One must understand the ways in which the airport will help farmers in the area and the region. The Congress is trying to spoil the game, but will not be successful in its plan.” 
  
  
 
 He added that the landowners will get options for   packages and the direct purchase method was also under consideration (see graphics). “Another option involves some percentage of floor space index ( ) for the landowners as against their plots,” he said.
 
 “More than 70% land has been acquired without any hassle. If you look at the protests, one can find that the number of protesters has dwindled. We hope the land acquisition process to begin within two weeks,” he said.
 
  “The CM he has directed all agencies, including PMRDA, road development and MahaMetro, to ensure that their projects have the new airport in mind at the planning and execution stages,” Shivtare said.
