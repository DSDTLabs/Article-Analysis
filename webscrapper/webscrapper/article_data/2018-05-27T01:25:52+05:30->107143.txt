NOIDA:  , a student of Step By Step School, Sector 132, Noida, has emerged as the all-India topper this year in CBSE Class XII examinations, scoring 499 marks or 99.8%. She is the second girl from the city to achieve the feat in two years.

 A humanities student, Meghna says she is thrilled at the achievement and is trying hard to deal with the sudden media attention. In fact, the attention is here to stay for a while as she scored 100/100 marks in four subjects — psychology, geography, history and economics — and 99 in English. While Meghna had been a diligent and a consistent student throughout, the economics paper leak controversy did upset her, she said.
 
 “It was really upsetting because I had studied really hard for the economics paper. It was very frustrating when I got to know that there was going to be a re-test. But it was good that it turned out to be as good as my first paper,” she told media persons. Meghna said she wants to pursue psychology as her major and hopes to get admission in the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. A singer and voracious reader, the 17-year-old says she can’t remember the number of hours she had been devoting to her studies every day.
 
 Meghna’s achievement has left her parents Gautam and   elated. “It is her diligence, planning and consistency that helped her achieve this. This is her hard work and she did not take tuitions for any subject. We never pressurised her,” said Gautam, an associate professor at  . Her mother Alpana is the HR head for a multinational company in Gurgaon. Asked whether scoring 499 marks mattered, she said: “If you want to get admission, it matters a lot”.
 
 The topper has an advice for other students. “Don’t get stressed over your exams. You don’t need tuitions. I had been organised throughout and told myself that I wouldn’t succumb to the pressure. Just be consistent and prepare your notes,” she said.
