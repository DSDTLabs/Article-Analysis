PANAJI: Portugal Prime Minister   said his visit to Goa, besides being an official one, was a very emotional and personal one as well. 

  ‘No Flowers No Wreaths’, the English translation of his father Orlando da Costa’s play in three acts ‘Sem Flores Nem Coroas’, is set on the night of the end of Portuguese rule in Goa in 1961. It has been translated by Isabel de Santa Rita Vas and published by Goa 1556. 
 
 Costa said it was his father’s passion for Portuguese literature that took him to Lisbon. He studied at the University there and not in Mumbai where his father wanted him to. “From that moment my father made the Portuguese language is own. My father never left Goa because Goa never left him. The novels he wrote, from ‘O Signo da Ira’ to ‘O Último Olhar de Manú Miranda’, Goa was always present in his work. In Konkani, he only taught me two wordsBabush and Babulo. My father used these when he talked to me and my brother. We also got the scent of the beedi he smoked and the taste of sorpotel,” he said. 
 
 “Wherever I go or wherever I’m taken to I will always be in my homeland,” he said, quoting from the book. The Sign of Wrath, the English translation of ‘O Signo da Ira’ considered Orlando da Costa’s magnum opus was presented to Antonio da Costa early this week by Prime Minister  .
