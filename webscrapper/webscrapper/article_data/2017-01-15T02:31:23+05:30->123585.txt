NOIDA: The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has written to   CEO Deepak Agarwal   for setting up of an NDRF training and operational centre.

 Two acres of land was identified last year in Noida’s Sector 153 for the permanent establishment of an NDRF training and operational centre.
 
 According to Muneesh Kumar, NDRF deputy commandant (administration), a team of officers had visited the site on December 14 and December 31 last year “to determine the suitability of two acres of land proposed by the Authority earlier last year for setting up of the centre. The team found plot No. A-11, A-12 and A-13 in Sector 153 suitable for the purpose. We request the CEO to sanction the land to establish a team of NDRF for Noida and Gautam Budh Nagar,” Kumar said in the letter, sent on Friday.
 
 The NDRF is a specialised force constituted for a specialist response to the threat of a disaster or when disaster strikes, under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.
 
 In the proposed centre, which will cover the district of Gautam Budh Nagar, NDRF master trainers will provide hands-on training on life-saving techniques as well as theoretical information about various natural and life-threatening disasters like earthquakes, floods and fires. They will also provide training to volunteers.
