VISAKHAPATNAM: In remote areas of  , a visit to the hospital is a rare practice. Even pregnant women, who are supposed to get regular health check-ups, rarely see a doctor unless in emergencies. The reason is a deep-seated lack of awareness; the women are unaware that   conduct health check-ups every month free of cost - an initiative launched as long as a year back by the Centre to tackle infant and maternal mortality and increase institutional deliveries.

 Lakshmi, a seventh month pregnant woman hailing from Paderu, said she was suffering from multiple ailments right from the fourth month of her pregnancy. However, the thought of going to a hospital did not cross her mind.
 
 “I was not aware of this scheme and I could not undergo any medical tests due to lack of money. But this month, the doctors have assured me that they would conduct free screening and will do all the required tests free of cost,” Lakshmi said.
 
 “Free check-ups for pregnant women, including outpatients, are conducted on a daily basis. Up to the first 28 weeks, the mother is advised to undergo a check-up once a month and from the 28th week of pregnancy, she has to get a check-up done once in every 15 days,” says Dr Hemalatha, superintendent of Government Victoria Hospital.
 
 “The government scheme Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Maitritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) has helped in spreading awareness among poor women as we have been receiving many cases from rural areas. This has helped high-risk patients recognise the deficiencies and has enabled doctors in providing the required treatment. The results are sent to the   for further intervention,” Hemalatha added. 
 
 This month, the screening for   at government hospitals will be done on Monday as July 9 being a Sunday was a holiday.
