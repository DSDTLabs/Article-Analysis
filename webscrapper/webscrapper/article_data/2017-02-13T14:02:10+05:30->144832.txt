MARGAO: Goa BJP general secretary Damodar (Damu) Naik on Sunday expressed empathy with over 50,000 families affected by the recent   verdict banning bars and wholesale liquor outlets operating within 500 metres from national and state highways from April 1 onwards.

 Naik told reporters that the views of all stakeholders were not taken into consideration when this petition was filed in the Supreme Court and as such, a small state like Goa, which is a tourist destination, is severely affected by this decision. 
 
 Requesting the public not to panic, the former   condemned the   (GPC) president Luzinho Faleiro’s remarks, blaming the BJP government for this issue.
 
 Stating that 70% of the state is covered by state and national highways, Naik said, “The coastal belt is not much affected and as per my sources, there are 2,000 officially declared wholesale liquor stores and approximately 13,000 1icensed-bars operating in Goa. Goa government has to take cognizance of the livelihood of those dependent either directly or indirectly on this trade, and immediately act on humanitarian grounds by constituting a committee to find a solution to this problem”. tnn
