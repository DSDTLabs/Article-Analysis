BENGALURU: A day after   national president Amit   described Siddaramaiah’s government as the most corrupt he has ever seen, the chief minister on Friday hit back by calling the Shah a “brainless man”.

 Both the   and BJP launched a Twitter offensive calling each other names. Shah at the Mysuru rally on Thursday had said: “Siddaramaiah means corruption and corruption is  .’’ Reacting to this, the CM told reporters: “Shah has no brains.”
 
 Later the CM tweeted from his official handle: "Says an exjail bird who chose another former jail bird to be his party's CM candidate for our   election. Can he present facts about the so called corruption charges against me or my Govt? Just telling lies wont help. People will not believe his #jumlas.”
 
 Quick with a repartee, state BJP chief B S   on his Twitter handle, said: “The world knows the political acumen of our party president   whose strategy helped defeat the Congress at the Centre and many states. Please maintain dignity and don’t lose sanity when defeat is again staring at your party.”
