Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has served a notice directing demolition of nine temporary flowers and puja material shops inside   premises. This has led to a controversy as the shopkeepers and some patron members of Shri Sai Seva Mandal — the trust which manages the temple — have accused   of exceeding its jurisdiction, and pressurising shopkeepers on the trust’s directives.

 The NMC Laxmi Nagar Zone sent a letter to the trust on December 27. The NMC letter directed the trust to raze shops in the temple premises to make arrangements for parking vehicles. “There is no provision to park vehicles coming to the temple. Vehicles are currently parked on Wardha Road and streets in adjacent residential area, causing congestion and other problems. Traffic police have also issued two letters to the trust, directing it to create parking. NMC will demolish the shops and recover expense from the trust in case it fails to do so on its own,” NMC said.
 
 One of the patron members of the trust, Rajeev Jaiswal, alleged that NMC is taking these steps to fulfil the agenda of the trust. “There are nine shops with tin-roof in the temple premises. These shops are owned by people who were part of the temple’s construction in 1979. NMC has nothing to do with the shops. But the trust plans to construct new shops etc on left side of the entrance gate, without obtaining required permissions. I lodged a complaint with this to office of Charity Commissioner, and objected to the construction activities. The trust submitted an affidavit saying there will be no construction. Thus, the trust’s plan was foiled. Therefore, an office bearer of the trust started pressurising shopkeepers through the civic body,” he said.
 
 Jaiswal added NMC did not take any action against the trust’s office bearers despite his complaint of unauthorized construction inside the temple premises. “Gallery on rear side of the temple is closed. Toilets were constructed, and tin sheds erected along the compound wall without any sanction. I lodged a complaint with the civic chief, who referred it to Laxmi Nagar Zone. Till date no action has been taken. But NMC engineers were so active to issue notice, even though it is not their jurisdiction,” he said.
 
 One of the shopkeepers, Naresh Shriramwar, said the trust was pressurising shopkeepers to shift their establishments to a new place. “The trust is planning new shops, where the rent will increase manifold, and shopkeepers will have to pay property tax. Also, the new shops have been planned towards compound wall on Wardha Road, which could be removed for road widening. All shopkeepers are refusing to accept the plan. Therefore, such pressure tactics are underway. We have got stay from high court against such notice issued by Nagpur Improvement Trust in 1987. Still, NMC is interfering in this issue without jurisdiction,” he said.
 
 The NMC engineer said the notice was issued in public interest. “Parking space is need of the hour at the temple. Also, traffic police are insisting the trust should make parking arrangements. We have sought building plan from the trust, and will take further steps only after going through the plans,” he said.
 
 Trust secretary Avinash Shegaonkar said some people are trying to disturb peaceful atmosphere at the temple, and in the trust. “The plan is to begin parking of two-wheelers inside temple premises. Therefore, we plan to construct new shops for all shopkeepers in one area. We did not give any letter to NMC. Notice was served following complaints from a patron,” he said.
