RANCHI: Former Maoist   was presented before the media by the   on Sunday, at least three days after he had reportedly surrendered. 

 Asked about the reason behind his surrender, Pahan said: "I decided to surrender because the Maoists have deviated from their ideals and are now engaged in extortion only. They are amassing wealth and sending their kids to foreign countries for studies."
 
 It is believed Pahan had been in touch with the police ever since he was thrown out of the CPI (Maoist) in 2014 for not adhering to party rules.
 
 Pahan alias Vikas aka Ashish, a resident of Barigarha village under Arki block of Khunti district, is an accused in 128 cases related to left wing extremism (LWE). He carried a bounty of Rs 15 lakh on his head. On Sunday, incidentally, a cheque of the same amount was handed over to him by additional director general of police (operations) R K Mallick.
 
 Pahan shot to infamy with the murder of former Tamar MLA, Ramesh Singh Munda in 2008 and masterminding the cash van loot of ICICI bank the same year. The van was carrying Rs 5.5 crore and nearly one kilogram of gold. Pahan, who was the secretary of the   regional committee of CPI (Maoist), was also a key accused in the killing of Bundu DSP Pramod Singh and beheading special branch inspector Francis Induwar.
 
 At the press conference which was attended by his uncle, aunt, cousin and eight-year-old daughter, Pahan admitted to all his crimes barring one where a woman had accused him of rape. "I am responsible for all the cases, except the one in which a woman had charged me of raping her," he said without commenting on the other cases lodged against him in police stations of six districts.Pahan described the killing of Tamar MLA as a decision of the party but refused to divulge details on the Rs 5.5 crore he had looted way back in 2008.
 
 "I am not a rich man. Though I have around 2600 acres of land at my native place, I never had cash in hand," he told the media.
