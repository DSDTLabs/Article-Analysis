It was time for celebration as MLC Farooq Hussainâ€™s daughter   and her husband   hosted the cradle ceremony of their daughter,  . The venue, all decked up in pink, had a dream like ambience, while live ghazal music added to its serenity. The beaming parents smiled all evening as guests, dressed in their traditional best to suit the mood of the occasion, congratulated them and fussed over little Zahra. The li'l one looked cute as a button in her tiny peach frock and pink headband. Chatter filled the air as the guests caught up with one another and bonded over the delectable Hyderabadi cuisine.
