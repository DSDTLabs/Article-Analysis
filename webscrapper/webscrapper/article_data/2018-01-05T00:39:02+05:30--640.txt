Madurai: A newly-married couple committed suicide by hanging in a village near Sivaganga. The couple who were from different castes had eloped and got married against their parents’ wishes. Investigation with the neighbours revealed that the couple often quarrelled.

 The deceased were identified as P Karupaiah, 23, and his wife M Rajeswari, 20. Police said Karupaiah, a native of Oorikottai in Ramanathapuram district worked in a bakery in Sivaganga, whereas Rajeswari was doing a nursing course. They fell in love a year ago while travelling in bus.
 
 As the family members opposed their affair, they eloped and got married four months ago. They rented a house in Puliyadithambam near Kalaiyarkovil.
 
 Police investigation revealed that Rajeswari wanted Karupaiah to get rid of his drinking habit. Since he continued to consume alcohol, Rajeswari got frustrated and committed suicide by hanging. Karupaiah, who reached later, found his wife hanging. He immediately brought her down and loosened the sari noose around her neck. As she was already dead, he too, decided to kill himself with the same sari and hanged.
 
 Police said that both had left separate suicide notes that stated that no one was responsible for their death.
 
 Based on a complaint from S John Kennady from the neighbourhood, a case was registered under the section crpc – 174- suspicious death. While a detailed probe was underway, a separate investigation by revenue divisional officer was also conducted, specifically on the death of the Rajeswari.
