Nagpur: 35-year-old Krushna Harinkhede was allegedly killed by his employee over illicit relationship with his wife between Sunday and Monday evening.

 Harinkhede’s body was found in a cement pipe near a nullah in Tarodi at around 5.30pm when a passer-by spotted it and told the cops.
 
 DCP (crime) Sambhaji Kadam and zone IV DCP Nilesh Bharne reached the spot soon after the incident, along with other staff of Nandanwan police.
 
 Harinkhede, who also owns a dairy and a land in Tarodi area, had left home on Sunday but was missing since then. A missing person’s report was also registered at Nandanwan police station. The accused have been identified as Roopsingh Solanki and Dinesh Morya.
 
 Sources said Solanki used to work at the dairy owned by Harinkhede. However, Solanki caught his wife with Harinkhede a day before the incident. After the illicit relationship between his wife and employer came to fore, Solanki killed Hirankhede by strangling him before hitting his head with a wooden stick.
 
 Harinkhede was the son of a former sarpanch and husband of ex-upsarpanch. Sources said Solanki killed Harinkhede and stacked his body in a cement pipe near the nullah with the help of Morya.
