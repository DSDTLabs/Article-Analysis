PANAJI: Claiming that nobody was keen to take up the education portfolio in his cabinet, chief minister   announced that the government’s impetus would be on matching the quality of teaching with the revamped infrastructure of schools in the state. 

 “I had made up my mind about two portfolios which I would never leave. One is finance, as I love it and the state was in such a bad shape. The second, education, which I chose to keep with me. Also the fact that no one else wanted it. Goa spends 3.8% of its GDP on education. In the next five years, we will increase it to 6%,” the chief minister said. 
 
 Talking about the revamped infrastructure in the state’s education sector, Parrikar said now it has to match with the quality of teaching. 
 
 “Since my first tenure, we have spent a lot on infrastructure, like the Cujira school complex. A task force for the school complex, led by   MLA  , has been created for it. Their first task is to give it a good name. They will spend about Rs 80-100 crore. We need to match this with appropriate quality in teaching. Teachers should be passionate about their duties and not consider it to be just another job,” he said, adding that the government will create more such complexes in Margao and Ponda. 
 
 Parrikar also urged educational institutes to include character-building in their curriculum. “Studying at   helped me build confidence which has in tun, helped me survive my professional and political life. It taught me ethics and administrative duties. This should be a part of our education and can only be taught if teachers themselves practise it.”
