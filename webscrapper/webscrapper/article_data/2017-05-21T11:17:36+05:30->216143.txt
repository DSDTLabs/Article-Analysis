 The report is learnt to have inducted senior officers in the government and engineers and contractors involved in the Gomti Riverfront Development project, entailing an expenditure of over Rs 1,550 crore.
 
 A highly placed source revealed to TOI that the chief minister wants to initiate action against the guilty and has set up a committee to study the recommendations of the committee so that specific charges can be framed.
 
 TOI has learnt that the Justice Singh committee has found that the project was riddled with environmental issues, inflated costing and faults at concept and design stages. Justice Singh was assisted by professor of finance at IIM-Lucknow AK Garg and retired professor of riverine engineering at IIT-BHU UK Chaudhary. The project was started when   was the irrigation minister and   the principal secretary of the department.
