 While The   (CST) will be lit in   to commemorate the day on Saturday, an audio-visual program about autism will be screened at the terminus throughout April. “An art exhibition will be held at   where paintings made by children and youths on the autism spectrum will be displayed,’’ said the forum’s Babita Raja. 
 
 Central Railway’s CPRO Narendra Patil said, “This initiative will create awareness about autism in the society. We had done similar campaign for breast cancer in the past.”
 
 Also, posters giving information about early signs of autism will be displayed at all stations along the Navi Mumbai stretch, from Vashi to Panvel.
