 Sources said the a number of demands of the staff members are pending, including a review of wages, working hours, leave policy and so on. A few months ago, a few districts had been affected by a similar strike.
 
 COO, EMRI Gujarat, Jashvant Prajapati, told TOI that the allegations are baseless and all benefits are provided according to policy on a timely basis. “Some employees from the affected districts have instigated other employees to join the strike. These employees are facing or have faced action for mischief or misbehaviour,” he said.
 
 Prajapati said that of the fleet of 585 ambulances, less than 10% of ambulances were affected and alternative arrangements were made with the state government’s department of health and family welfare.
