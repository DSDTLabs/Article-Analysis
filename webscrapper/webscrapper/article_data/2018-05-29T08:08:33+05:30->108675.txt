PATNA: The   ( ) will declare the Class X results on Tuesday (May 29). Candidates can check their results on results.nic.in, www.cbseresults.nic.in and www.cbse.nic.in. 

 
 “Results of CBSE Class 10 examinations for 2017-18 to be declared by 4pm on 29th of May, 2018,” Union human resource department secretary Anil Swarup tweeted on Monday. 
 
 After eight years, the students will get their results in percentage, instead of Cumulative Grade Points Average (CGPA) grading. The CBSE had done away with the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) pattern in December 2016 and reinstated board exams for Class X for the session 2017-18. The   pattern was introduced in 2009.
 
 Around 12.2 lakh students, including 63,376 girls, appeared for Class X examinations in Patna region (  and Jharkhand) from March 5 to April 4.
 
 Kavya Singh, a student of Radiant International School, said she is excited and nervous to see her results. “After a long gap, the board is going to release the results, which show individual’s percentage rather than CGPA. Otherwise, it was difficult to know who topped in the school, state and the country,” she said.
 
 Preety Kumari from   (BSEB) said, “I had written all my papers well and I’m confident to score good marks. At the same time, I’m scared because earlier we had to prepare for 50% syllabus for board exam and also get 20 marks for co-curricular activities. But this time we had to prepare the whole syllabus.”
 
 Ragi Rajiv of Notre Dame Academy said, “I am not expecting high marks. I will get what I deserve. The papers were difficult for this batch because CCE was scrapped all of a sudden and we were not fully prepared to cover the whole syllabus for final exam.”
