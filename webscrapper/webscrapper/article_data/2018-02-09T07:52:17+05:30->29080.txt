CHANDIGARH: After inking a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute ( ),   local government minister   on Thursday said the problem of drains flowing in major cities of the state would be tackled in an effective way and will be turned into green belts.

 Sidhu said the condition of drains was pathetic since they were covered at places and shops were made on that preventing the de-silting as well. He said drains in Punjab had become the dumping grounds for the industrial waste, building material and dead animals, completing making the place an eyesore and toxic. The minister said project to clean drains will be launched in a phased manner from March in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Patiala and Budha Nullah, Ludhiana.
 
 Sidhu said the technology by NEERI would see plantation being done in the drains and water would be cleaned by using advanced technology. “Moreover, the water treated through this technology will be fit for gardening, flushing and even irrigation,” he said.
