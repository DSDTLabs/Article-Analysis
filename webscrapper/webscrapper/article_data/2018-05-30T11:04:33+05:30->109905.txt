LUCKNOW: Just four days before ATS ASP Rajesh   shot himself, entire police team had lauded his efforts in working out   serial bombing case of July 2013.

 
 
 A member of WhatsApp group titled ATS Info had posted news about conviction of five men arrested for executing the blasts. Sahni had investigated the case while being in National Investigation Agency. He thanked everybody, including IG ATS  , for their congratulatory messages.
 
 
  
 
 “He took it lightly, while others saw it an achievement. Experts at federal agencies working on cyber terrorism, terror funding, VoIP calls interception and other complex matters consulted Sahni Sir since he formed the backbone of UP ATS,” said an inspector who reported to Sahni.
 
 Among a few handful officials known to plan and pull off operation seamlessly, Sahni was popular among subordinates and mentored several young officers at the ATS facility in Nadarganj. As the news of his death spread on WhatsApp, they rushed to   office.
 
 “As ATS police station is also housed in Gomtinagar building we thought the office was under attack and Sahni sustained gunshot,” said a constable.
 
 “He was the pillar of strength at ATS since 2014. He had mastery in gleaning inputs,” said IG ATS Asim Arun. ASP ATS JK Singh said, “Sahni was my batch mate. He was an encyclopaedia of terror outfits. He had a knack for noting minute things and developing them into significant inputs.” Since November 2006, Sahni worked with premium agencies like STF, NIA and ATS. Sahni had also busted the   terror module of Kanpur in which IS-inspired terrorist Saifullah was gunned down in Kakori, Lucknow in March 2017.
 
 Sahni was a writer also and had keen interest in ‘shayari’.
