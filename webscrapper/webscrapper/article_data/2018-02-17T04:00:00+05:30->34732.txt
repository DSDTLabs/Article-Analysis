Rajkot: Four traders were on Friday booked for running the racket of fraudulently selling goods of fair price shops in Amreli. 

 Amreli city police station booked Dhiru Solanki, Irfan Ghoghari, Joru Chudasama and Ramesh Makwana, all residents of Amreli, for the scam on a complaint filed by Amreli mamlatdar Manilal Jadav. The accused are yet to be arrested. 
 
 During his inspection, Jadav stumbled upon food coupons issued in the names of ex-MLA Thakarsinh Metaliya and Sharad Dhanani, brother of leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani of Congress. 
 
 “This made Jadav wonder as to what was the need for Metaliya and Dhanani to buy food grains and essential commodities from the fair price shop. Upon investigation it was revealed that the coupons were bogus and had been fraudulently generated,” deputy mamlatdar of Amreli L N Ghelani said.
 
 “It was found that the accused would generate bogus food coupons in the names of ration card holders and buy food grains and kerosene under the state government’s Annapurna scheme of providing essential commodities to those living under below poverty line and sell them at higher prices,” Ghelani added.
 
 “For example, they would buy one kg wheat grain at Rs 2 from the fair price shop and sell it at Rs 25 or Rs 30 per kg in the market. The scope of the scam is yet to be ascertained as the details will emerge during interrogation of the accused,” he explained. 
 
 During probe it was found that Dhiru had generated three food coupons, Irfan five coupons, Ramesh six coupons and Joru had two coupons. As a punitive action, the district food supply officer has suspended the license of their fare price shops for 90 days.
