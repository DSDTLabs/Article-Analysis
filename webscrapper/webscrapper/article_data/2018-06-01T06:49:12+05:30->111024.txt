MARGAO: Citizens of the Cuncolim constituency have planned an agitation on Saturday opposite the Cuncolim petrol pump to protest the frequent power disruptions. Local MLA Clafasio Dias has offered his support to the protest, which will begin at 9.30am.

 “The power being supplied is not adequate to bear the consumption load, so it would be better if power minister Pandurang Madkaikar took lessons from former power minister Digambar Kamat on how to improve his department as Kamat was very efficient,” the legislator said.
 
 Dias, along with Cuncolim Municipal Council vice-chairperson Sashank Dessai, block Congress vice-president Shailesh Jotkar, mahila block president Georgina Gama and others told reporters they had submitted numerous memorandums to Madkaikar, chief electrical engineer (CEE) Neelakanta Reddy, executive engineer Santosh Lolienkar and other department officials regarding the hardships faced by the people due to the frequent power outages.
