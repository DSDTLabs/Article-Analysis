Pune: A 28-year-old man — who was   — abused and attacked a policeman on premises of the Hadapsar   on Sunday. 

 The man, Abhishek Vilas Gore, had gone to the police station following a quarrel at a restaurant in the area.
 
 “He was arrested under sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging his duty) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) of the Indian Penal Code. He did not lodge complaint against the hotel owners,” said inspector Kiran Londhe. 
 
 Under each section, an offender is liable to be punished with imprisonment up to two years and/or a fine. 
 
 The incident at the police station took place around 10.30pm. 
 
 Gore, a resident of Mahadeonagar in Manjari, was drinking in the family section at a restaurant in Hadapsar. Some time later, he lit a cigarette. The owner of the restaurant told Gore to desist from smoking as it was prohibited in his establishment. In his inebriated condition, Gore took offence to the request and started quarrelling with the owner. 
 
 After hurling abuses, Gore threatened to lodge an FIR against the restaurant owner and asked the latter to accompany him to the police station. The duo arrived at the police station, where things rapidly escalated. Gore kicked up a racket, removed his shirt and used abusive language on the policemen on duty. He then picked up a quarrel with havaldar Abhay Kale (44). 
 
 Gore attacked Kale when the latter tried to pacify him. “Gore had initially claimed that he was a businessman, but he is actually unemployed,” Londhe said, “Gore’s brother told us that he was not in a proper state of mind during both the incidents, at the restaurant as well as the police station.” TNN
