MUMBAI: Days after   overflowed,   became the second   that supplies water to Mumbai to do so on Tuesday, thanks to significant rainfall over catchment areas. Situated at   in Thane district, Tansa supplies around 400 million litres of water to the metro daily. Last year, it overflowed on August 2.

 Over 100mm of rainfall was witnessed in three water-supplying lakes in the 24-hour period from July 17 to 18. 
 
 Tansa began to overflow at 4.55pm on Tuesday. Officials from the BMC’s hydraulic department said they expect the lake to touch the full supply level shortly if the wet spell sustains. 
 
 “Tansa supplies around 400 million litres of water to the city every day,” said a civic official. 
 
 Mumbai’s daily requirement of 3,750 million litres of water is supplied by seven catchment area lakes. Water stock in the seven lakes must total 14.5 lakh million litres by the end of monsoon to ensure round-the-year supply to the city.
