NAGPUR: “In military, fellow soldiers are like blood brothers as they are prepared to sacrifice their life for their partners. Patriotism comes from within. Therefore, a sense of nationalism should be imbibed in youth,” said  , former lieutenant general, on Friday.

 Delivering the presidential address at a function organized by   at Maharshi Vyas Hall of Dr Hedgewar Smruti Mandir, Reshimbagh, to felicitate Chasen Lowang whose husband Hangpan Dada made the supreme sacrifice, Thodge decried the elements within the country questioning the integrity of the Army. “Debates on freedom of speech, differences of opinion and ideologies are understandable, but casting doubts on loyalty of the armed forces can never be tolerated,” Thodge said.
 
 Former judge of the   Vikas Sirpurkar shared his experience of visiting an army camp in the north-east and said, “The conditions under which soldiers live are very challenging, but they stand guard to protect the country. The so-called human rights activists chant slogans against the Army, but none of them raises a voice against stone-pelters (in Kashmir).” 
 
 Brigadier Sunil Waze said, “Soldiers do not believe in any caste, creed and religion once they join the Army. Patriotism becomes their religion. We should not appreciate the hard work of soldiers only on Independence and Republic days. We should make it a habit to remember their valour daily.” 
 
 Waze said that wives of soldiers are very strong. It is with this support that a soldier can survive in difficult situations and in different terrains.
 
 A short film made by the   to salute the sacrifice of Dada was also screened. A Students of Prahar paid tributes to Hangpan Dada by presenting a dance on ‘Badlu ram ka badan, jamin ke niche hai’, the   song from where the martyr belonged. 
 
 Chasen, controlling her emotions, thanked Prahar organization for felicitating her and recognizing the valour of Hangpan Dada.
