LUDHIANA: Three armed goons barged into a house in Prem Nagar, Islamgunj, and held three members of the family hostage before making off with Rs 8.5 lakh and jewellery on Monday afternoon. 

 House owner  , 46, said in her police complaint, "My husband Kingpal, who runs a lottery and finance business, had gone to his shop in Ghanta Ghar. I was at home along with my daughter and sister-in-law Prem Kumar. Around 2.15pm, three masked men entered our house and held us hostage."
 
 The knife-wielding goons asked the family to hand over cash and jewellery to them. "Scared, we gave them Rs 8.5 lakh and our jewellery. After collecting the loot, the robbers, who were between 25 and 30 years old, ran away," Lalita added. 
 
 As the trio raised the alarm, neighbours gathered outside their house and chased the robbers.
 
 Fearing being caught, the goons threw away the cash bag and made good their escape through the narrow lanes. 
 
 Division 2 police station SHO inspector Gurwinder Singh said, "CCTV cameras installed in a nearby area have captured the robbers."
 
 "It seems the miscreants parked their motorcycle at some distance before striking," said another cop.
 
 Police have registered a case and launched a manhunt to arrest them.
