On the inauguration of the   in Gurgaon on Monday, when the   set out to teach Gandhigiri lessons to traffic offenders by giving them roses and chocolates, Gurgaonwallahs surprised them by rarely violating traffic rules.

 
 
 The police officials were in a fix for a long time about who to give roses to. They then distributed the roses randomly among commuters. Balbeer Singh, DCP Traffic, told them, “Hum apko yeh gulab rules follow karne ke liye de rahe hain.” The Gurgaon Police was conducting the drive with Road Safety Ofiicers (RSOs) who helped them in spotting commuters who should be honoured on the road.
 
 Whenever the cops stopped a car, the response was, ‘Maine kuch nahin kiya’ and the constables behind the DCP said, ‘Isliye toh apko roka hai’. While the awareness drive was conducted at IFFCO Chowk and  , the overspeeding drive was conducted at Gurgaon-Faridabad Highway.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Girish Gupta,   said, “The implementation of traffic rules, which was once unimaginable, is proof that whatever the complaints were in the last few months, Gurgaonwallahs have brought about a long-overdue shift towards a gentler, more law-abiding society.”
 
 
 
 On the highway, Traffic Tau also joined the police, and in his Haryanvi accent, he explained to the motorists that they should follow traffic rules. When he spotted two bikers without helmets, Tau didn’t let them go without saying sorry, and with the rap, “Janwar ka dimag hai ke? Baat samajh nahin aa rahi?” Talking about his plans for Road Safety Week, he told us, “Fursat kahan hai? Gurgaon mein bahut jagah ja kar logon ko traffic ke baare mein batana hai.”
 
 Rajkumar Yadav, a RSO, told us, “Gurgaon used to be a city where traffic rules were viewed as entirely optional, but now, anyone can see the change.”
