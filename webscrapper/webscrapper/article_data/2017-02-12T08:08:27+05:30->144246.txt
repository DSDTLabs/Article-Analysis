 However. the Pune unit of the party says it has not received any official communication from the party regarding the matter. Chandrakanta Sonkamble, general secretary of RPI (A) and the party's lone sitting corporator, said, "We have not received any show cause notice from the party to explain why we're (still) contesting under BJP's symbol. We have only read messages on social media that RPI (A) candidates who are contesting under the lotus symbol have been expelled from the party." 
 
 Sonkamble said, "We have crossed the last date for withdrawal of nominations, and candidates have completed campaigning for eight days. Before taking this decision, the party leadership should have taken into consideration the fact that we did not get a recognized symbol from the election commission for the entire state in 30 years," Sonkamble said.
