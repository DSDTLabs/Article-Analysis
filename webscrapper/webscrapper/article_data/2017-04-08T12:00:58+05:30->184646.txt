PATNA: A lawyer has moved the Patna high court, pleading for an independent probe into the soil purchase deal between the Patna zoo and an upcoming private mall near Saguna Mor.
 
  Manibhushan Sengar in his PIL filed on Friday said the soil excavated from the mall site was purchased by the   for Rs 90 lakh without floating tenders. Deputy CM   and forest minister Tej Pratap Yadav are on the board of directors of the firm developing the mall, the PIL says.
  
  Sengar has made the forest minister, state chief secretary, principal secretary (forest) and the Patna zoo director as respondents. Funds to the tune of Rs 90 lakh was withdrawn from the  , the interest on which is to be used only for conservation of wildlife and forests, the PIL says, adding its utilisation for beautification work at the zoo indicates misappropriation of funds.
  
  “I have prayed to the court to order an inquiry to find out whether the soil was actually needed for the earth-filling work at the zoo and whether due procedures were followed to make and execute the deal. Also, on whose permission were soil-laden heavy vehicles allowed to enter the zoo after 7pm even though it is a reserved forest area,” Sengar told TOI.
  
  His PIL has also prayed for a probe into the withdrawal of Rs 90 lakh from the   Wildlife Conservation Fund, which is meant for wildlife and forest conservation work.
  
  Sengar said he has made the forest minister the main respondent as it was a matter of “conflict of interest”. “Soil from the project site of the firm reportedly associated with Tej was purchased by his own department. It shows a clear conflict of interest,” he said and added he has also pleaded to the court to inquire whether the beautification work was needed or not.
