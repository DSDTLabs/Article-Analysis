MUMBAI: It's often said that players from North East India have that extra stamina to take them the distance. And Aizawl players proved that the saying is no myth as they showed their reserve energy to stun hosts   1-0 in their   clash at the Cooperage Stadium on Sunday. 

 Syrian  's well-placed shot in the 79th minute was enough to seal the victory for the visitors in what was a mediocre performance by both teams. The win took them to third spot with 10 points, behind leaders   and East Bengal.
 
 Mumbai coach   promised fans attractive football, and his team didn't disappoint, pushing forward at every given opportunity. Unfortunately for them, they weren't able to create real goal-scoring opportunities despite dominating proceedings for majority of the match.
 
 The attacking front is something that Kashyap will need to work on quickly. They were totally beaten in that department and weren't able to beat the Aizawl defence.
