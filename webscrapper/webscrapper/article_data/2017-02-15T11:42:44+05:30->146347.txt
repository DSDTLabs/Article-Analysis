SURAT: Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a company under the Union power ministry, has set its eyes on the man-made fabric (MMF) cluster in Surat for setting up energy efficient textile processing units. 

 The EESL is all set to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with two textile processing units, to be suggested by the   (SGTPA), for setting up the programmable logic controller (PLC) and the caustic recovery plant at the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) at Pandesara GIDC. 
 
 Official sources said that the project will be undertaken by the   Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) with support from the   (GEF) for promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy in Surat’s textile cluster in collaboration ministry of MSME (MoMSME) and the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE). 
 
 A brainstorming workshop on ‘promoting market transportation for energy efficiency in Indian MSMEs in Surat’s textile cluster’ was organised in the city on Tuesday. 
 
 Addressing a gathering of textile processors, chief general manager (CGM) of EESL, S P Garnaik said, “EESL will select two model units for improving production using energy efficient technology in Surat. The project will be launched under the Unido and GEF funded scheme. The main aim is to improve production and save energy. After the success, other units may also join in the project.”
 
 Garnaik added, “Surat figures under the climate change initiative. Thus, it is high time the textile sectors and other related sectors must think on reducing the carbon emission by using state-of-the-art technology.”
 
 President of SGTPA, Jitu Vakharia added,, “We have asked EESL to fund the caustic recovery plant at the CEPT in Pandesara. The CETP is unable to process the waste generated from the textile processing units that have turned manufacturing cotton fabrics. Also, the automation of the processing units will help in reducing energy and the carbon emission.”
