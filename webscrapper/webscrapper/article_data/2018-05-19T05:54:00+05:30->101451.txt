 About 15 trains from Belagavi pass through Kudachi station to Miraj and other towns. All trains, except Nizamuddin Express, halt at this station due to which it’s among the highest revenue generating stations in Belagavi sector. 
 
 But the same station doesn’t have basic amenities. There’s no drinking water facility and darkness rules after 6pm. People have to sit on the platform due to lack of seats. Morever, there is no proper platform. There have been instances of travellers falling while boarding trains and have sustained injuries. Shahid Yaligar, a pilgrim from Belagavi, said this station has been in bad condition for several years. “We don’t have any other choice but to buy drinking water. People feel unsafe waiting for trains as there’s poor lighting and no facilities. This station should be upgraded soon,” he said. 
 
 Mohsin Rohile, a resident of Kudachi, said: “Another new rail route from Bagalkot to Kudachi has been planned and will come up in the near future. The station will be busier. The station needs to be upgraded immediately.”
