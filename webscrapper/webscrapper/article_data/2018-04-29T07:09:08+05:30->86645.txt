PATNA: The   (PESU) is set to introduce 19 new substations to create additional capacity for meeting increased demand of power in near future. 

 Work in this regard has already started and is targeted to be completed by December 2018.
 
 According to PESU GM  , the city’s existing power demand is 530-540 MW, whereas it is expected to rise to around 572-600 MW in near future. “To meet this anticipated increase in demand, a Rs 450-crore project under the   is being executed, under which 19 power substations are being set up in different parts of the city,” he said and added these new substations would act as alternate power sources in case of power breakdowns from regular sources.
 
 Singh said power distribution network in the city was also being strengthened. Before establishing the substations, the project envisages laying power cables and new electric transformers in the marked areas to ensure smooth distribution of electricity.
 
 “Since the existing overhead electricity supply wires cannot take the load of increased demand, new cables are being laid across the city,” he said and added underground cables would be laid in all those areas where there was no space for installing electric poles. 
 
  will be laid in areas like Danapur and  , where space is available for laying overhead wires. “Aerial bunched cables are considered best for power distribution in congested urban areas with narrow lanes or less open areas,” he said.
