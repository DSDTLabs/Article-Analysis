BENGALURU: Chief minister Siddaramaiah has two big challenges to face in a month: present a please-all budget on March 15 and ensure the   victory in   and Gundlupet bypolls to be held on April 9.

 The bypolls are crucial for both the Congress and the BJP as these will be the first run-up to the assembly polls due in April 2018. For now, the JD(S) has decided to remain neutral and not identified any candidates. 
 
 V Sreenivas Prasad had quit both as an MLA from the Nanjangud assembly segment and from the primary membership of the Congress after he was dropped from the cabinet in June last year. The death of minister H S Mahadev Prasad has necessitated the bypoll in Gundlupet. 
 
 The Congress wants to retain both the seats as there’s speculation that the high command would look into the state unit’s revamp after it. The Congress had drawn up a strategy to draft all its ministers to both the constituencies with each cabinet colleague in charge of a gram panchayat. However, the budget session commencing from March 15 will conclude on March 31, which is going to restrict any campaign strategy of the Congress and the BJP until then.
 
 The BJP is pulling all stops to wrest both the seats from the Congress. While Nanjandgud is a reserved constituency, Gundlupet has been represented by Lingayat candidates. 
 
 The Congress is expecting to ride on the sympathy wave in Gundlupet where Mahadev Prasad’s wife Geetha has commenced campaigning. Unable to find a strong candidate within the party in Najangud, it is fielding Kalale Krishnamurthy, who defected from the JD(S) recently.
