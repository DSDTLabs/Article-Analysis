INDORE: While   has taken several steps to ensure the city gets a good rank in the  , several areas still needed to be addressed.

 While the door to door garbage collection service has been lauded, the idea of segregating waste in houses is yet to be implemented properly. 
 
 Collection vans have been equipped to handle segregated waste but households are yet to dispose of it properly.
 
 “We have been running continuous awareness drives. A changed habit must be inculcated among people and it will take time,”  , additional commissioner, IMC, said.
 
 In order for the door-to-door facility to be successfully implemented, the civic body needs to come out with proper plans to end the jagirdari system. 
 
 Similarly, while the city has been declared open-defecation free, some people could still be seen relieving themselves out in the open. The civic body is trying to change this by penalising offenders and educating them about it.
 
  on vacant land is another problem that IMC faces. While big dustbins have been removed from the city, people still throw garbage. “We have given notices to owners of such property and action will be taken against them if they do not fence off their land,” Saxena said.
