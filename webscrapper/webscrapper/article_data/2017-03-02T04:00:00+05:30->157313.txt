Vadodara: The family members or the principal of the school in a village of Santrampur taluka are yet to file an offence regarding the alleged incident of sexual harassment of a schoolgirl by a teacher.  The incident had reportedly happened on February 23 and came to light only after a message regarding it was circulated on the social media. Both the Santrampur police and education department officials have conducted extensive inquiries into the allegations. The officials camped at Surpur village where the alleged incident took place and have also been visiting it frequently since the incident came to light. Sources said that the incident is said to have taken place with a standard eight girl at the school itself. A school teacher allegedly harassed her sexually after the prayer meet at the school. The girl reportedly narrated the incident to her family following which family members rushed to the school and raised the issue. Police sources said that they had been trying to convince the family of the girl to file an offence. “However, they said that they would wait for her father who is posted in Delhi to come home and only then decide,” said an officer. An education department official said that he was conducting an inquiry in the matter. “I will complete it and send a report to my seniors. I cannot comment on the findings of the inquiry as it is a confidential matter,” said the official. The police had earlier written to the principal of the school and the girl’s family asking them to register an offence regarding the alleged incident.
