Mumbai: The proposed merger of   and   is likely to miss the October 8 timeline to arrive at an acceptable agreement. This was disclosed by  , chairman Shriram Group.

 “We said that this (merger proposal) is an initial thought, subject to the   approval and to valuations. So we are in that process of discussion with the RBI and in respect of valuations,” said Piramal. He added that IDFC and Shriram had chosen to announce the merger proposal before any decision was taken so that there was no allegation of insider trading.
 
 Piramal said that there was no fixed merger proposal and the partners were discussing various alternatives. “We will look at what is in the best interest of the shareholders of Shriram and we are also protecting the interest of shareholders of Piramal Enterprises,” said Piramal.
 
 In July, IDFC and Piramal-backed Shriram Group had agreed to merge and create the largest retail-focused bank in the country. The merger proposal envisaged Shriram City Union Finance merging with the bank and Shriram Transport Finance getting delisted and becoming a subsidiary of IDFC Ltd — the parent of  , which was to become the group holding company. 
 
 The managements of the two groups had agreed on a 90-day period, starting July 8, to complete due diligence and explore merger. If the two parties arrived at an agreement on the proposed lines, a formal merger was to take place in 12 months. The proposal is subject to approvals from the RBI,  ,  , CCI and stock exchanges.
 
 One of the challenges to the merger was retaining Shriram Transport Finance as a stand-alone finance company. The RBI regulation requires that in any banking group, any lending activity that can be done within a bank should be done within a bank.
