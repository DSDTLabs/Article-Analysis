KOCHI: The   (KWA)will provide water from its under-used plant at  . 

 The decision was made at a meeting held with the district collector on Friday. The move is expected to bring down the dependence on the KWA's supply point at Aluva. 
 
 Though the Maradu plant has a capacity to treat 100 MLD (million litres per day) of water, it supplies only 50 MLD. "As the conveyance lines have not been laid properly it is not possible to supply water through pipelines. Hence, we are unable to utilize the entire capacity of the plant. At the same time, there are sufficient arrangements for filling tanker trucks," said a KWA official adding that the officials were waiting for higher authorities to take a decision enabling them to supply water to tanker trucks and function the plant at its full capacity. 
 
 KWA supplies water to tankers at a cost of Rs 60 per 1,000 litres. The officials confirm that the KWA has been generating good revenues by supplying water to tankers. There are more than 400 water tankers in the district. As most local bodies object to taking water from open wells and other depleting sources within their limits, most of these tanker trucks rely on the water supplied by KWA's plant at Aluva. 
 
 Senior engineers with KWA said the plant would not be able to manage more than 150 tankers per day. 
 
 KWA officials said around 100 trucks filled water from their facility at Aluva on February 2. "We supplied 15-20 lakh litres of water. There was a long queue of trucks waiting to fill water. It is nearly impossible for us to meet the demand," added the official. They said unless early preparations are made it wouldn't be possible to tackle the water crisis during summer.
