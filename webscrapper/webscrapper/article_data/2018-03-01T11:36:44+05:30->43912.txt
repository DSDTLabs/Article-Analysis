AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Wednesday issued notice to the Centre, state government as well as   town authorities in response a PIL seeking court's intervention in proposed beatification of historic Hamirsar Lake. 

 Authorities have proposed to construct a pathway and view-points on the lake as part of the beautification project in Bhuj town of border district of Kutch. The proposal also met with protests by a few locals. One of them   has approached the HC through advocate C J Gogda and demanded that the decision taken by the authorities for construction on the water body should be revoked.
 
 The petitioner submitted that the construction of pathway on 400-year-old Hamirsar Lake of width of 5 metre over a stretch of 160 metre periphery will lead to direct reduction in the capacity of catchment area of the water body. This will lead to deterioration of the environment and eco-system in the vicinity which is habited by rare bird species. Any adverse impact on environment in the town amounts to infringement of fundamental right of life for public at large, the petition stated.
 
 The petitioner has urged the HC to direct the authorities to propose measures for conservation of the lake by putting up construction in a manner that does not lead to reduction of the area of the water body.
 
 The HC has sought reply from concerned authorities including the director of National River Conservation Directorate, Ministry of Environment Forests & Climate Change.
