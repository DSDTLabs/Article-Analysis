VISAKHAPATNAM: This will surely come as bad news for those hoping for a   railway zone in Vizag. The recent political and other developments concerning the Centre and the state more or less means that the people of north coastal Andhra Pradesh can forget about the separate rail zone.

 S S  , president of   (URV) one of the vocal figures fighting for the rail zone, said due to the prevailing relationship between the state and the Centre,   could be paying a big price as far as the   is concerned. 
 
 “We should not expect the railway zone. One of the two Union ministers from the TDP had made bold statements that the railway zone would be addressed by the Centre before March 5. But, before the deadline, the ministers resigned from their posts and the prevailing acrimony between the BJP and TDP means we can forget about the railway zone,” Shankar added.
 
 When contacted, Anakapalli MP   from the TDP, who also made several representations in favour of the railway zone in the Parliament, said: “We will continue to fight for it. The railway zone will become a reality before the end of our tenure. If the railway zone demand is not addressed by end of this tenure, we shall not sit quiet.”
 
  A senior ECoR official told TOI that railways never divides its network based on the demands of states and regions, but according to its operational needs. “As of now, railways doesn’t feel there’s any operational need to establish a new zone with Vizag as its headquarters,” the railway official said on condition of anonymity.
