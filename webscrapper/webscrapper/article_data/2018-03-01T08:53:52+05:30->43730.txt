CHANDIGARH: On his first visit to Chandigarh for the golden jubilee function of MCM DAV College on Wednesday, President   hailed Chandigarh as the first planned city of independent India and an example of green, clean and healthy city. "The citizens have contributed a lot to its present form." 

 While appreciating the role of educated women in society, the President also praised city girl   for her bravery, saying the country was proud of her. "There is a long list of women achievers from Chandigarh but if I have to spell out one name, it will be Neerja Bhanot. In 1986, she countered a terror attack and saved 359 air passengers. Not just Chandigarh, but the entire nation is proud of her, as she laid down her life for the safety of other passengers."
 
 Kovind also hailed Chandigarh as as the first city to take an initiative in recycling and for this he cited  's rock garden as an example. "There has been emphasis on recycling and reuse by city planners, who visualised the city this way. Chandigarh has been leading in management and disposal of industrial waste and utilisation of renewable energy," said the President. 
 
 Talking about the role of women empowerment for the betterment of society,   said, "In a male-dominated society, women have to face hardships from all quarters. How can they come out of this situation? I believe that parents must allow their daughters freedom of thought. This instils confidence in them and then they can achieve new heights." 
 
 He added, "Last week, Flying Officer   flew a fighter jet. Haryana's Phogat sisters have also proved that no field is taboo for daughters. If parents of PV Sindhu, Sania Mirza, Saina Nehwal and Aruna Reddy had not granted them freedom and encouragement they could not have been successful. Women have to attend to family duties. But these responsibilities shouldn't become obstacles in their lives ahead."
