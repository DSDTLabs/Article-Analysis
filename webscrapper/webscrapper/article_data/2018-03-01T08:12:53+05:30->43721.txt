LUCKNOW:   will provide unique student IDs to newly admitted undergraduate students to maintain a centralized database from the next academic session. The identity card number will also serve as the roll number on the admit card as the university will not allot a separate roll number at the time of examinations. The single student identification number will facilitate all examination and academic work. 

 "To maintain a centralized database of all undergraduate students in academic session 2018-19, the university will issue a unique student ID number. This will facilitate all examination-related work," said admission coordinator  . 
 
 Instead of issuing different identification numbers for different academic work, a single number will help maintain all information, he added. The examination and admission teams are working to make the system more transparent and student-friendly. 
 
 The move will help save time at the university data resource centre. The final decision will be taken after a meeting before the UG admission process begins on March 19. 
 
 Mishra added that impersonation or morphing photographs on admit cards for examination will be impossible after issuance of this unique number. The system is only for LU students and not for affiliated colleges, he added.
