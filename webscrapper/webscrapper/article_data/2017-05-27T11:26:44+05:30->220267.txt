GREATER NOIDA: One of the men who was in the car that was ambushed by a gang of six off the   in Jewar on Thursday, the brother-in-law of the scrap dealer who was murdered, made a startling new revelation on Friday.

 The 40-year-old man, who was dragged into the fields along with seven others in the car, said their assailants had asked if they ate  . 
 
 “They asked us if we were Muslims. We nodded. They asked if we were beef-eaters. We said no. They then grabbed us and said they would teach us a lesson,” he said.
 
 He admitted he had not mentioned this in the complaint at Jewar police station, based on which the FIR was filed, and attributed the omission to his mental state after the attack. “We were unable to figure out what to do. There were certain things which did not come to our mind at the time of filing the FIR,” he said.
 
 District police chief Love Kumar said the victims had not mentioned anything about beef to the police. “They registered an FIR but did not mention this. We will talk to them to investigate the matter,” Kumar said.
 
 Earlier in the day, one of the women who was allegedly raped retracted her statement about neighbours being involved. The woman said she was traumatised and not in her right senses. “I had given a statement to some mediapersons on Thursday that three of the six who attacked us were our neighbours. We have some family dispute with the neighbours and hence I made the comment. The accusations are not true and I take my words back,” she said.
 
 Police said they had a property dispute in the past but senior officers pointed to the family’s changing versions to signal their wariness.
 
 Hours before the Jewar ambush, police had on Wednesday night issued an advisory for commuters when travelling on highways and expressways. It advised drivers not to stop/park vehicles at secluded places, or offer lifts to unknown persons, and get GPS devices installed in cars.
