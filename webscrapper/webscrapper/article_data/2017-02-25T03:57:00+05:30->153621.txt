AHMEDABAD: The growth disparity among Indian states is increasing as poorer states are still lagging behind the richer ones and this is in sharp contrast to the situation in other parts of the world, Arvind  , the chief economic advisor, the  , stated on Friday at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A). 

 Citing the example of the equalization process in China, he said, “Within China, the poorer provinces are catching up with major provinces.” He said inequalities among regions are actually coming down in China. “The situation is exactly the opposite in India. Over the past 15 years, poorer states have been growing on average slower than the richer ones,” he said. 
 
 Subramanian, an IIM-A alumnus, delivered a talk on surprises thrown up by India Economic Survey 2016-17. One surprise is that India has become a more open economy than China after the global financial crisis. How much a country exports and imports as a share of the GDP is one way of assessing the openness of a country. “It is true that China’s trade was much greater over the past 25-30 years,” he said. “However, we have overtaken China as the nation that trades much more. After the global crisis, the trade in China has plummeted enormously, while India has seen its trade growing constantly.” 
 
 Among other surprises revealed by the economic review is the growing churning in India. “Around 8-9 million people move within India, which is more than what was thought,” he said. Contrary to the popular perception that the flow of goods within India is not substantial, the survey showed that share of interstate trade in the country’s GDP is about 55%-56%. “This is greater than what has been recorded even by Canada (20%), the   (20%) and Indonesia (12%),” he said. However, the figures are 78%, 76%, and 74% in case of the US, Brazil, and China respectively.
