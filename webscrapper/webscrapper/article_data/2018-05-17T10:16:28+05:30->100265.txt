WASHINGTON: Having a fight with a spouse may not only hurt feelings, but also worsen symptoms of   conditions like   or diabetes, a study has found.

 
  from   found that in two groups of older individuals — one with arthritis and one with diabetes — the patients, who felt more tension with their spouse also reported worse symptoms on those days.
 
 The findings, published in ‘Annals of Behavioral Medicine’, could potentially help couples suffering from chronic diseases.
