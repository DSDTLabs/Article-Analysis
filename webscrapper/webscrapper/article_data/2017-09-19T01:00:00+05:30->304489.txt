After roping in sports stars to get Gurugrammers to vote in the civic polls, the   (MCG) has now appointed   actor   as the brand ambassador for the upcoming elections. According to MCG officials, the Gurgaon boy will help them reach out to potential voters, asking them to cast their vote in the elections, which are scheduled to take place on September 24. 

  But the actor won't be seen in the usual videos and posters asking Gurugrammers to vote, he'll go and meet them instead. The MCG officials told us that Rajkummar will meet potential voters and talk about his upbringing in Gurgaon, and why they should come together to bring about the change they want to see in the Millennium City.

  "They (MCG) want me to be the brand ambassador for the Gurugram elections and I am more than happy for it. Gurugram is my city and I was born and raised here. It is very close to my heart and if I can contribute in making people aware people about this really important right (to vote) in our country, then why not," says Rajkummar.
 
 
  
  
 
  This is the fourth celebrity endorsement for the civic polls in recent weeks after sportspersons Sakshi Malik, Deepa Malik and Akhil Kumar released videos where they urged Gurugrammers to vote in the civic polls. SS Rohilla, MCG PRO, said, "When celebrities endorse any cause, people pay more attention to it. So we thought that we should invite more celebs to ask people to vote. Initially, we had planned to get a video from Rajkummar Rao but then we found out that he'll be in Gurgaon for film promotions. So we spoke to him and he agreed to meet the voters at an event in the city."
 
 
  
  
 
  The MCG officials also tried to get in touch with Akshay Kumar for a video message, but due to his schedule, he was unable to do so. An official said, "He was in Delhi on Sunday for an event and we wanted to shoot a video with him but as his schedule was too tight, it could not be accommodated."
