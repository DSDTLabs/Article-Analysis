MUMBAI: A month after a newly married woman’s body was found behind Gorai bus depot, the MHB police claim to have cracked the   case with the arrest of her 25-year-old   from  . Police claimed Asif Siddiqui, who is from   district in UP, strangled his new bride, Sabreen, because his parents forced him to marry her. 

 On April 10, locals found a 22-year-old woman’s body behind Gorai bus depot. “Besides strangulation marks around the neck, there was no identification mark on the body. We circulated her picture on social media and put up posters,” said senior inspector Arun Satpute. They got a tip-off that she could be from Barabanki. A police team reached Barabanki and made inquiries and the body was identified as that of Sabreen’s.

During interrogation, Asif said after the wedding, he brought Sabreen to Gorai, where he lives in a rented room. He said he took her to an isolated spot behind the depot and str-angled her, said ACP (Borivli division) Nandkumar More. tnn
