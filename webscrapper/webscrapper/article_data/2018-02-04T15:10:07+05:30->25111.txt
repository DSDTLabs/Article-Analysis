PATNA: Chief minister   on Saturday inaugurated a “centre of excellence” at   and Hospital ( ) which will provide diagnostic services. The state government has spent Rs 47 crore to establish the centre.

 Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, health minister Mangal Pandey and road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav were also present on the occasion. 
 
 “The centre will facilitate pathological, microbiological and radiological tests as well as X-rays under one roof. The blood bank has also come under this centre,” NMCH deputy superintendent Dr Gopal Krishna said.
 
 “The building is part of a three-phase development plan for NMCH. A 1,500-bed hospital and a 100-bed trauma centre will also come up at the hospital under the plan,” superintendent of the hospital Dr A P Singh said. 
 
 After the inauguration of the diagnostic centre, NMCH resident doctors met the CM and raised several issues, including unavailability of medical facilities at the hospital. “The emergency has nearly 50 beds which have not been segregated under different departments which leads to a lot of confusion,” said NMCH Junior Doctors’ Association president Dr Ravi Ranjan Kumar Raman. 
 
 He added the hospital requires several important equipment, such as mechanical ventilator, cardiac monitor, portable X-ray machine, anaesthesia machine, portable ultrasonography, portable electrocardiography, defibrillator, stress test machine and HOLTER, a portable device for cardiac monitoring.
 
 The junior doctors urged the CM to introduce the facility of echocardiography at the hospital. “We have to refer patients to other hospitals for echocardiography. This may endanger the life of a serious patient,” added Dr Raman.
 
 The hospital also doesn’t have neurosurgery facility. Dr Raman said nearly 250 patients with neurological problems visit the neurology OPD and some of them have to be referred to   and Hospital.
