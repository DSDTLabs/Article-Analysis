Mumbai: While   and   have been in the news for over a year for students’ protests,  , too, has had its own share of similar agitations. 

 IIT-B students’  , Insight, has pulled out old editions that covered two agitations. Much against the popular perception that IITians do not indulge in campus politics and agitations and are focused on academics, articles publish-ed in the September 2002 editi-on giving a detailed account of a March 1980 protest has taken many by surprise. “After four students went on hunger strike, a record 63 high-strung general body meetings were held in 10 hostels in a period of four days,” reads the   article.
 
  Following the expulsion of four ‘popular’ students in 1980, many students boycotted classes, indulged in sloganeering and “gheraoed” the director. They demanded the suspension be revoked, students be allowed to complete BTtech in eight years at their own pace, extra coaching classes for deficient students, and student representation on bodies dealing with their matters. The director then issued a circular ordering indefinite shutdown of the institute and students were asked to leave the campus within three days. The agitation lasted for 21 days. Later, the director put forward his own demands, which were accepted in parts.
 
 “That the actions taken were rather overreactions to issues, was a point huddled and acc-epted in both the factions (teac-hers and faculty), that did not salvage the loss of 21 days, or an equivalent 45 days of research, the loss of the repute of the inst-itute by the mudslinging exerc-ises,” concludes the article. Student magazine, Pragati, that or-iginally published the article, was banned after the incident. 
 
 Another agitation was in 2003, when members of the students’ body resigned from the post following the dean’s order to cancel performing arts events on the campus. tnn
