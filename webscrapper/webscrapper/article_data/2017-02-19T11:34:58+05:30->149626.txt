KOLKATA: For someone who was India's leading lady golfer four years back,   has seen her career taking a nosedive following a string of injuries. What's been particularly frustrating for the 25-year-old Bengalurean is that the injuries have been spread out - much like the bunkers on a golf course - forcing her to stop and restart. It's been like hitting out one bunker to another.

 “It's been a roller-coaster ride for me in the past four years. It's never easy to stop playing for two months and starting all over again. It takes you a step back each time,” said Sharmila on the sidelines of the 3rd leg of the Hero Women's Professional Golf Tour at the   on Friday where she finished tied eighth. 
 
 A sesamoid hairline fracture on her little toe of her left foot in 2014 forced her to make a slight change in her swing. Even as she was working to get back into her groove, she suffered similar fracture on her little toe on her right foot. As a precaution, Sharmila has been advised to use extra cushion in the insoles.
 
 On the positive side, she is injury-free now and has hit the comeback trail. She, however, does not want to get ahead of herself at this stage. “Realistically it will take me some time to get back into the groove.”
 
 Was it a regret to miss out on the Rio  ? “Of course, it is. I missed the opportunity because of my injury. But it is certainly one of my long-term goals.
 
 “Tokyo 2020 is on my mind. To go to the Olympics, you have to have a plan in place,” Sharmila said.
