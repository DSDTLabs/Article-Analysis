MUMBAI:   Tukaram Mundhe has raised the red flag over the Maharashtra government’s   for   across the state. 

 Mundhe, in a letter addressed to the principal secretary (urban development department) on March 10, said that the scheme to regularize illegal structures could have disastrous consequences, especially in a planned township like Navi Mumbai. The   on Thursday referred to the letter and Mundhe’s opposition to the scheme while hearing a PIL on authorized structures in Digha in Navi Mumbai. The state government has sought the court’s permission to implement the scheme that will protect unauthorized structures prior to December 31, 2015, and will allot them to apply for regularization of the buildings on payment of a penalty. The high court is likely to decide on the state’s application on Friday.
 
 In the letter, Mundhe has referred to the fact that a major chunk of illegal buildings have come up on land owned by the government, Cidco and MIDC violating rules for marginal open space, parking and floor space index norms. Even on gaothan lands, unauthorized structures have come up in a haphazard manner and the extent of violation is around 200%. “Such development has been carried out on very narrow streets that may lead to disaster in the event of any natural or manmade calamity. Even NMMC is presently unable to provide fire, health and ambulance services in these areas,” wrote Mundhe. 
 
 The civic chief also raised concerns over the safety of these buildings that have been constructed without any quality checks or under the supervision of a licensed architect or structural engineer. “Unauthorized construction on government land and plots reserved for public amenities such as gardens, playgrounds, open space, roads, schools, hospitals... If we regularise such unauthorised construction then this will lead to reduction in amenities area which is not acceptable,” he added.
