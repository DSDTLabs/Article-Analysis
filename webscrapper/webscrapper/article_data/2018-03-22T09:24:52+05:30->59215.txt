 ZIRAKPUR: The sad news from   in   will have consequences, just as it had causes. For four years since   held 39 Indian workers hostage in the  , the Indian government had been lying to their families that their loved ones were alive and waiting to be evacuated.

 External affairs minister   has now dropped a bombshell on them in Parliament by pronouncing them dead on the basis of DNA tests. Had they been rich, the government would have put all its might into the rescue effort. Those 39 Indians were casual workers, so the government thought they were expendable. India still practices the discrimination that the Indian Constitution banned decades ago.
 
 The government should have recognised that they were Indian citizens first and given priority to extracting them. What compelled those 39 men to work in a country at civil war? Wasn’t it joblessness? Their families are shattered and broke.
 
 The least the government can do is apologise to them and rehabilitate them. The government promised to bring them home. Home they’ll come, but in a coffin.
