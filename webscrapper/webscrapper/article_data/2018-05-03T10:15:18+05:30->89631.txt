CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation has assured the Madras   that immediate steps will be taken to remove encroachments on Kavangarai   which passes through  , Thirunagar and MMDA Colony. 

 The authorities gave the undertaking to the court when a PIL was moved by Vadapalani Kulakkarai Residential Public Welfare Association.
 
 Recording the submission made by the authorities, a division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice P Rajamanickam posted the plea to June 4 for further hearing.
 
 Kavangarai canal crosses 100 Feet Road in Vadapalani and gets separated from the Koyambedu Paul Canal. After passing through Vadapalani, Thirunagar and MMDA Colony it drains into Cooum at Choolaimedu.
 
 “The canal was originally formed for the purpose of Virugambakkam drain development plan and then no government official looked into the project. Eventually, residential houses were built on the acquired land of 2,345sqft in Thirunagar meant for the formation of Virugambakkam drain. Though in 1992 MMDA special tahsildar gave representation to the PWD to remove the   made in the canal no actions were taken against the representation,” the petitioner said.
 
 The petitioner added that due to the encroachments, the area was affected by floods in 2005 and 2015.
