NAVI MUMBAI: The civic fire department is planning to acquire the latest high-tech equipment to improve its operations. 

 They include advanced jumping cushions used to rescue individuals trapped in high-rises, long range torches and other state-of-the-art equipment. 
 
 “We are upgrading the system to tackle any form of disaster. The existing cushion that is with the department cannot be inflated and has to be held by the fire officers during rescue operations,” said additional municipal commissioner Ankush Chavan.
 
 The advanced jumping cushions are easily inflatable, can be handled by just four officers and can rescue people jumping from a height of 30 metres. 
 
 The light-weight cushions will have illuminations too for night rescue operations. 
 
 The fire department also plans to purchase 16 long range torches with a 2,000m beam distance that can work continuously for 240 minutes in full power and 180 minutes in low power.
 
 “We are awaiting the response from bidders to provide these items which will really help in conducting smooth rescue operations,” a senior civic official said.
 
 The civic administration will spend around Rs 1.20 crore to buy these safety equipment. 
 
 There are future plans to procure new vehicles with ladders that will be able to scale a height up to 30 metres which is equivalent to 20 floors of a high-rise building, a fire official said.
 
 “These vehicles will make it easy to rescue individuals trapped on higher floors in residential towers,” he added.
