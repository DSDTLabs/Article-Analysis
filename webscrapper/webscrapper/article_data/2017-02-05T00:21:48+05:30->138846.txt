Jaipur: The Rajasthan Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) have sent its team to Chennai and other parts of the country to investigate the suspected network of alleged IS fund raiser Jameel Ahmad who was arrested by   on November 17.

 A senior official within ATS said they have found some information about the network of Ahmed in Mumbai and Chennai . “He had been receiving information from several parts of the country which he sent to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq,” an ATS official said. 
 
 “The initial interrogation revealed that Ahmed had become a trusted fundraiser for IS commanders. He was familiar with hawala transit routes, which enabled him to deliver money to IS-held areas through Lebanon and Turkey," the official told TOI.
 
 The ATS top brass suspect that Ahmed had established contacts with several top ranking terror commander of IS such as Abu Hurayra alHindi. “Ahmed knew Mohammad Sirajuddin, an IS recruiter who was arrested from Jaipur, although the two had never met. Ahmed also knew Sirajuddin’s Filipino friend, another IS recruiter herself,” sources said. 
 
 “IS operates in shadows as unlike Al-Qaeda or Lashkar, this outfit doesn't have any hierarchy of ranks. Most of its operatives know each other by code names or fake social media profiles. They talk to each other through encrypted apps like Kik,” an ATS official said.
 
 The ATS official said that along with NIA, it will track other suspects who have established contact with Ahmed. “We have recovered his phone and laptops, he had deleted most of the chat history but we will try to retrieve it,” the official told TOI.
