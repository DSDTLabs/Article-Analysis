AHMEDABAD: Gujarat University has decided to debarred an Afghan   student,  , from taking examinations for two semesters. GU has also decided to lodge a police complaint, but it is not clear who will be the complainant.

 The BBA student will be allowed to take his examination in December 2019. Last December last,  , an Afghan engineering student, was caught taking the ‘Basics of Mathematics’ exam of the BBA course as a proxy for another Afghan student, Ismail Niyamatullah. Rehmani is a semester four student at Vasad Engineering College. Niyamatullah was a semester one student of the BBA course. Rehmani was caught at the exam centre at Narayanaguru College on Satellite Road.
 
  Gujarat University (GU) authorities were tipped off about the proxy exam-taker by local students. The flying squad of GU and a college professor apprehended Rehmani when he was taking the exam.
 
 The duo had taken a colour printout of Niyamatullah’s hall ticket and had pasted Rehmani’s photo on it, to allow him to gain entry to the exam centre. GU vice chancellor Himanshu Pandya said Niyamatullah is a student of JG College of Commerce and has been staying in Ahmedabad for two years. “Recently, an examination reform committee meeting was held and during their hearing, the two students were found to be guilty. As Niyamatullah is a student of Gujarat university we have punished him and apart from failing him in this examination, he will not be allowed to take the exam in the next two semesters.”
 
 Officials said that since the first semester examinations are held in December, Niyamatullah can now take the examination only in December 2019. GU also decided that since Rehmani is a student of Gujarat Technological University, they will inform the GTU authorities about Rehmani’s involvement.
 
 GU has also decided to lodge police complaint, as the examination centre authorities had failed to lodge one.
