NEW DELHI:   alleged that   legislators were marshalled out of the assembly to save the government from embarrassment over the sealing drive. 

 “I wanted to draw the attention of the government to the suffering of traders caused by the   of government to notify 351 roads where the traders are facing the threat of sealing. The opposition was not allowed to raise the issue. The mikes of BJP MLAs were switched off whenever they tried to raise the issue,” Gupta alleged. 
 
 He added, “The AAP government is responsible for the sealing. The notification of 351 roads for commercial and mixed land use has been pending with the government since 2007. The civic bodies submitted the files around a decade ago. I was forced out of the House when I demanded that the urban development minister immediately notify these roads.”
 
 Gupta said the speaker did not take any disciplinary action against the AAP MLAs when they displayed banners and shouted slogans. “The government is conniving to ensure that sealing is carried out to malign the BJP-ruled civic bodies. The government is interested in drama and not in saving the traders from sealing,” he said.
 
 Gupta also rubbished the government’s claim that the roads weren’t notified as the civic bodies didn’t submit complete answers to questions by the government.
 
 The government cleared a proposal to notify 2,183 roads. The proposal for 351 roads was made on the same lines,” Gupta said. He further alleged that “by keeping the notification pending, the AAP government wants to punish people of the city for defeating them in the civic polls”. 
 
 Interestingly, none of the establishments sealed so far are located on these 351 roads. “But the traders whose shops are located on these roads also face the threat of sealing,” said BJP MLA Manjinder Sirsa.
