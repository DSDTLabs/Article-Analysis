While it is earlier mentioned that the Naga Chaitanya-   starrer- ' ', under the direction of K Kalyan Krishna will be released on May 19, it is now revealed that the makers have decided to push the release ahead.

 
 Until yesterday, the movie is said to be clashing at box-office with actor Nikhil Siddharth's 'Keshava', which postponed its release from May 12 to May 19. 
 
 However, in a recent turn of events, producer of 'Rarandoi Veduka Chudam', Akkineni Nagarjuna mentioned that the unit will have to re-work on a few scenes and therefore the decided release, that is on May 19 is not final.
 
 If the reasons are true or not, we are nobody to decide, but given the kind of craze and applause the trailer of 'Keshava' garnered, we only think that the makers of Naga Chaitanya's film are keen on not wanting any competition at the box-office, in order to make sure the movie scores.
 
 Reportedly, the key actors of Rarandoi Veduka Chudam are taking part in the re-shooting of scenes. The movie's post-production works are going on simultaneously with Nagarjuna personally involving in every aspect of the film. He is in no mood to rush towards releasing the movie and will likely announce the date to be in the first week of June.
 
 
 Devi Sri Prasad is the music composer of the film.
