PUNE: Over the past two weeks, the traffic police has turned its focus towards wrong-side driving across the city. The police are taking action against offenders on one-ways as well as on roads identified as ‘safe streets’ across all traffic divisions.

 Senior officials confirmed that the drive will continue as rigorously in the days ahead. 
 
 While the number of cases spiked on March 16 and 17, records of the traffic department reveal a steady number of challans issued every day since March 14.
 
 Traffic police started penalising wrong-side drivers after a motorcyclist, driving on the   of F C Road, stabbed a techie. Ever since, The Times of India has also been highlighting the enormity of the problem through the On The Wrong Side campaign.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Pravin Mundhe has assured that there will be no relaxation in their action. “We are observing zero tolerance for wrong-side driving. Our force is concentrating only on this offence for the time being,” he said.
 
 While pointing out that the drive has created a positive impact, Mundhe admitted that the problem resurfaces as soon as police teams move away from their watch spots. “Traffic offenders must not ever forget that wrong-side driving is against the law,” he said.
 
 A more sustained approach will help check the problem, believes  , chairman of the  . “Catching offenders cannot be a sporadic effort. Catch them by surprise, change locations, move around on bikes so as to not be predictable,” he said.
