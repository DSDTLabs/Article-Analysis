RANCHI: Byelection at   (JMM) bastion   promises to be a battle between the saffron brigade and other parties. After the stupendous success in Uttar Pradesh with the party using their development plank, local BJP leaders are hoping to do a repeat in Littipara and bag a seat which never belonged to BJP since Independence. 

 While Congress and JMM are exploring various alliance options, BJP workers are hoping that development issues and changing mindset of electorate will reflect in the poll results. "People now want change. These moves of JMM and Congress for an alliance are destined to fail. The party's huge victory in UP has put all opposition parties on back foot," BJP general secretary of state   said.
 
 Prakash added, "The state government has done much to bring development in   district like sanctioning Rs 210 crore for augmenting the water supply. Many among the tribal populace of this district have got employment in the para-military force, Paharia Battalion. We have made our intentions clear and these factors will have an impact on the elections this time."
 
 Party spokesperson Pratul Sahdeo said, "JMM has won this seat eight times and yet this time they have demanded that the polls be conducted through ballot papers. This is a sure sign that JMM and other parties are panicking and they know they are on a sticky wicket. BJP workers are upbeat and enthused by our poll victory in UP and we hope to notch a victory in this by-poll."
