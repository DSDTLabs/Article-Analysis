After assisting his father, director Maharajan, in two films,   is all set to make his acting debut. The film, which will be directed by his dad, is expected to go on floors sometime next month. 

 Viswanath says, “I’ve grown up watching films, the way they are made and I know the kind of effort that goes into making them. I absolutely love the film industry and have always wanted to be a part of it. So, I started by assisting my father in two Hindi films. Soon, people started telling me that I should try my hand at acting. I was keen to both direct and act; I believe that directing a film requires a lot of energy and so, I wanted to first try my hand at acting. After I gain some more experience, I’d like to attempt directing a film.”
 
 Viswanath says his father had shortlisted two of his scripts — a city-based one and a town-based one — for his debut, and the two will begin work on either one soon. “He’s on a temple trip now, and also has to complete his Bollywood projects. But we’re looking at going on floors with our film soon,” he informs.
 Ask the youngster if he is nervous about acting in front of his father, who has directed actors like Vijayakanth, Arjun and Ajith in Vallarasu, Arasatchi and   respectively, and he says, “My dad is a thorough professional; paiyyan-nu pakkave maataru. I decided to act under his direction only after I was confident that I could match up to his standards. I’ve trained in stunts and also learnt dancing. He has a lot of expectations, and I hope I match up to it.”
