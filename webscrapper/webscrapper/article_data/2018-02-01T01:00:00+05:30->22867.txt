Apart from her debut Marathi film ' ',   Dixit-Nene is also gearing up to collaborate with a host of her B-Town colleagues —  ,  , Jaaved Jaaferi and Riteish Deshmukh — on the upcoming comedy 'Total Dhamaal'. Speaking about the movie, the dancing diva of the 1990s told BT, “The film is exactly what the title suggests, total dhamaal. It’s freaky and fun. Anil and I will be working together after 18 years. I can’t believe it has been that long since 'Pukar' (2000). We have a great equation even today. I have worked with Ajay and Riteish before, so I can’t wait for this journey to roll.”

 Interestingly, on Makar Sankranti this year, Madhuri’s first look from her Marathi film, which also stars Sumeet Raghavan, was trending online. The actress, who plays a simple, but strong-headed Puneri housewife in the film, trained to get the Puneri diction right and also learned to ride a bike. She shared, “It’s a slice-of-life, family entertainer. A lot of preparation has gone into it and I am really happy to take up something like this.” Apart from 'Bucket List', Madhuri is also looking forward to her first home production in Marathi. She said, “The film I’ve backed as a producer is also a family entertainer, but it comes with a beautifully woven message. I just feel that even if you don’t understand the message within a story, just enjoy the film for what it is. I love the subjects and emotional quotient of the narrative in both my Marathi films and that’s primarily why I decided to come on board.”
