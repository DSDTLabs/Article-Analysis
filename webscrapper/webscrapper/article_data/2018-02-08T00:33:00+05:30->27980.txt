Bengaluru: As many as 24,629 street vendors, who were identified by the BBMP in its last year’s survey, will receive identity cards by February 25. Mayor Sampath Raj said 10,000 vendors will get cards by February 11, and the remaining 15,000 by February 25.  In August 2017, the high court had asked the BBMP for a status report on the distribution of identity cards to the vendors. Following this, the BBMP conducted a survey during September-October 2017.  Only 25,000 vendors were identified through the survey, despite NGOs claiming that there are one lakh street vendors in the city. Once issued, the ID cards will protect vendors from eviction from their place of business. “We took the matter to court, which then directed the BBMP to distribute cards by February 21. The street vendor population in the city is between 1-1.5 lakh, but only a fraction of that will receive cards. While the cards will prevent vendors from being evicted from their respective vending zones, these zones have still not been defined,” said Vinay Sreenivasa of the Bengaluru Jilla Beedhi Vyapaari Sanghatengala Okkuta. Apart from granting licences to vendors, the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act passed in 2014 stipulates formation of a town vending committee (TVC) with 40% of its members drawn from the vending community, which will decide vending zones. “The rules for this Act have still not been framed, and the process has been going on for a few years now. At present, the ID cards are being distributed under the Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM). Under this scheme as well, a TVC must be constituted to decide vending zones. The authorities claim that the committee has been formed, but this only has the names of officials, not vendors,” Sreenivasa said.
