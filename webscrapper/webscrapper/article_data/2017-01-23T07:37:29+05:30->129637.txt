LUCKNOW: Some more avenues will open for economically weak job seekers in  . 

 Under a special programme,   will hire 200 such persons, whose annual family income is less than Rs 1 lakh, across Uttar Pradesh. There will be no age bar.
 
 Sharing the details, senior vice-president, HCL Technologies, Lucknow, Sanjay Gupta told TOI, "We had been tapping talent locally and are now extending the opportunity to others from UP too. The selected candidates will undergo a three-month bridge course, followed by a six-month technological training and finally three-month on-the-job training on live projects. After the completion of these courses the candidates will have assured jobs." 
 
 HCL has already selected 12 candidates from over 1,000 applicants. "The basic idea is to tap talent locally. Noida even though in UP, still has 70% of its work force from Delhi and neighbouring cities. Now, we want to tap talent from Lucknow," Gupta said.

The company has hired 600 young engineers for the IT hub here since October last year and aims to employ 5,000 more professionals. It will also create additional 25,000 jobs for engineers, HR and finance professionals, he added.
 
 The company also plans to hire more women. "At present, our work force has around 30% women and we want to increase it to 50%. And there will be no night shifts for women," he added.
