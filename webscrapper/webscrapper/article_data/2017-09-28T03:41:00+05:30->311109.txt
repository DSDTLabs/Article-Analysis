Panaji: Allaying fears of banks being closed for five days, bank officials in Goa have assured customers that both private and public banks in the state will remain closed only for three days, from September 30 to October 2. Effectively, customers will not be able to access banking services on September 30 and October 2, the intervening day being a Sunday. Dussehra will be celebrated on September 30 while October 2 marks the birthday of the father of the nation, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi Jayanti is one of the three national holidays. “Unless a holiday is declared under the Negotiable Instruments Act, bank employees have to come to work. There may be holidays in other parts of the country but in Goa, only two holidays are notified,” said a senior manager with a public sector bank. A WhatsApp message being circulated stated that banking services would be unavailable for five days from September 28th onwards. The WhatsApp message, which was widely circulated, spread panic among customers, especially senior citizens. Officials with HDFC Bank, State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda confirmed that banks would be open on September 28 and 29. Bankers said that firms that undertake cash-recycling services for ATMs had been asked to ensure that sufficient cash is available over the long weekend. Goa expects to see a huge influx of tourists from across the country for the long weekend.
