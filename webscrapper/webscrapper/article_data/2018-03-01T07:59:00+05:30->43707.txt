Rohtak: The Bhiwani police on Wednesday arrested three   on charges of stealing Rs 99,000 from a man who came to deposit money at the Punjab National Bank on September 4, 2017. The accused identified as Aniya (50), Rachna (30) and Rahana (25) hail from Madhya Pradesh. 
 
 Aniya is the mother-in-law of Rachna while Rahana is their kin, police said. Assistant sub-inspector Om Prakash told TOI that Shyam Lal, a resident of Dhana Narsana village of Bhiwani district, had gone to the bank six months ago to deposit money. 
  
 He was standing in queue when one of the accused women standing behind him stole all the money from his bag discreetly by making a hole using a blade. When he realised it was too late and the accused women had slipped from the bank. 
  
 A case was registered against unknown persons and they had remained untraceable. The matter came to light on Wednesday, when the complainant had gone to the same bank for some work and spotted the same gang of women in the bank and raised an alarm. 
  
 Police were informed and based on the CCTV footage of the day of the incident, the identity of the women was established and subsequently were arrested. Police also recovered Rs 50,000 from them. 
  
 Police said they were hopeful of cracking more such cases during investigation from the accused women. A case has been registered against them, police added.
