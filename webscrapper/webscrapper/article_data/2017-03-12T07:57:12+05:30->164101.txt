The   won less than it was expected to. Still, its 20 seats on debut do make it the second largest party in the Punjab Assembly. The SAD-BJP alliance - expected to be reduced to single digits - fared the worst, with 18 seats.

 A grand total of 117 seats with 59 for a majority is what the Punjab legislative assembly elections is all about. On the ground, the battle for control has been far more complex, bitter even. Part of the breadbasket region of India, Punjab politics has a noticeable impact on the much-larger political climate of the entire country. Traditionally, the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SA-D) have been the parties with political clout here. The Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) too made inroads thanks to coalition with SAD in the previous elections.
 
 2017 though may well see a new dawn in the political hues of Punjab - courtesy AAP.
 
 The Aam Aadmi Party made splashing headlines when the relatively new party stormed to an overwhelming majority in Delhi assembly elections. Supporters said it is the triumph of corruption-free politics. Critics said it was a fluke. Now, an encore of sorts beckons. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 CVoter has given AAP a clear majority with 63 seats. This is significant because AAP's presence was previously believed to be only in Delhi. A win in Punjab would be a shot in the arm for the party in its quest towards eventually becoming a national party. This is regardless of its performances in Goa where too it made its debut this year.
 
 Here's what his deputy in Delhi - Manish Sisodia - had predicted in an interview to Times of India earlier.
 
 
 
 
 
 While predictions for AAP's win have made headlines, a majority for Congress too has been predicted. This is every bit as significant as the grand old party's influence - also termed relevance by some - has taken a major turn downward in recent years. A win for Congress, some say, would be largely due to the anti-incumbency factor. Regardless, CM candidate Capt. Amrinder Singh would see a favourable result as a cornerstone in not just his political career but that a mammoth highlight in the political legacy of Congress.
 
 This is what he had predicted for himself and his party on January 29:
 
  
 
 
 
 Almost every pollster has predicted the SAD-BJP alliance to be reduced to single digits. While a major jolt to Parkash Singh Badal who became CM by commanding 68 seats in the previous state elections, BJP too would perhaps be hurting from the dent to their image if the forecast actually manifests into reality. Afterall, PM Narendra Modi himself campaigned in the state - invoking 'threat from Pakistan' to 'promise a CBI investigation into incidents of the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib' in order to woo voters.
