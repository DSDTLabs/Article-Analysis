PUNE: Citizens on Saturday morning woke up to a cover of light haze, bringing down the visibility to 5km, with a hint of warmth as the minimum temperature was 13°C.

 Met department officials maintained the haze formed because of smoke or dust particles suspended in the air. An India Meteorological Department (IMD) official said, “Fog is different. It is formed when moisture droplets get suspended in the air, reducing the visibility to 1km or less. The haze we saw reduced the visibility to 5km, which means one could not see beyond this distance for some time on Saturday morning.”
 
 According to the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s (IITM) System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (Safar), PM 10 and PM 2.5 (particulate matter) levels in city on Saturday were above the maximum permissible limit. The high pollution in the city could thus have caused the haze.
 
 
 
  
 
 The haze came with “warmth”. Pashan resident   welcomed the upward swing in mercury on Saturday.
 
 “It was not warm, but it was not even biting cold like the past few days. Where I stay, it is always a degree or two colder than other populated places in the city. Instead of the two blankets I take every night, I could make do with just one,” she said.
 
 Over the past few days, the city’s night temperature had been ranging between 11-12°C, maintaining the nip. The Saturday’s minimum temperature was 2.4 degrees above normal.
 
 It is still not the time to tuck your woollies away, though. The night temperature may dip by a degree again from Monday. While the minimum temperature may drop, the maximum may rise and touch 30°C from the next week because of clear skies.
