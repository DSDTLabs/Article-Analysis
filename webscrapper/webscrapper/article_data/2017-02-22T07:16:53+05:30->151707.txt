Taxing is a job that requires a lot of civility and humility and this is why art helps,“ sa id AK Shrivastava, principal chief commissioner of income tax.
 
 Padma Sub rahmanyam, who congratulated Kala Sangamam for its continuous interest in the arts for three decades, recalled how their performances had greatly impressed her a few years ago, when she was called on for prize distribution. “The two depart ments have come together to foster culture something which has been globally recognised as a soft power and an important factor for human harmony.
