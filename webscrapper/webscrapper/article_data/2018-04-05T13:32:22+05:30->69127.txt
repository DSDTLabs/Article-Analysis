COLVA: With summer setting in, it’s time for the elderly in Goa to go for their annual salt water bath in the sea in the hope of finding some relief from nagging aches and pains. For many senior citizens, the annual dip in the waves at this time has been a ritual for several years.

 “I started taking these baths with my mother when I was 35. I have continued ever since,” says  , 76, a resident of  . “For two hours a day, between 8am and 9am and between 4pm and 5pm, I lie in the shallow area where water rushes in after the waves have crashed. In fact, some of my friends take baths thrice a day,” she adds.
 
 “Earlier, we used to spend three entire days at the beach. But now it’s no longer safe to do so,” says  , another senior citizen.
 
 But Dr  , a homeopath and allopath associated with a Margao-based hospital, believes the effects of salt water baths are largely psychological in nature. “It is not scientifically proven that sea water baths help rheumatism or arthritis, but they must be helping people psychologically. The mind can work wonders for one’s health,” he says.
 
 Nevertheless, regular bathers continue with the tradition and have full faith in its efficacy. Among them is Marequin D’Costa. “It does not matter whether the benefits of these sea water baths are scientifically proven or not. We tend to feel better after this annual ritual and missing it haunts us throughout the year,” she says. 
 
 These elderly Goans swear by the cocktail of fresh breeze, warm sunshine, walking on the sand and refreshing themselves with salt water baths, which, they say relaxes them, invigorates their bodies and gives them a much-needed boost of energy.
