THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Call it a ‘collateral damage’ of the baseless social media campaign against beggars and destitute – as many as 34 individuals, who were found in the city during late hours on Wednesday ended up in the shelter home for destitute at Ayranimuttom. Later, it turned out that almost all of them were daily   labourers, mostly Malayalis.

 According sources, the 34 people, including six women, who were shifted by the city corporation staff from   terminal at Thampanoor with the help of police, worked in restaurants and other places. Though they worked in the city, they all lived in distant places. 
 
 “While some of them missed their regular buses owing to unexpected rains and chose to spend the night at the terminal so that they would not be late for work the next day, many others were there after watching second show,” a staff of the  , Sakshatkaram said. 
 
 The corporation’s act has resulted in the labourers missing a working a day. On Thursday, they kept receiving calls from their employers and family members. 
 
 According to district legal services authority (DLSA) secretary Siju Sheik, the authorities were concerned over the social media campaign accusing beggars and destitute of being members of kidnapping gangs that target children. 
 
 “In the present scenario, the shelter home is the safest place for a destitute and hence the authorities might have launched a drive to keep them away from the streets to save them from any kind of atrocity,” Sheik said. He also said that DLSA has employed legal aids to sensitise the inmates of the shelter home about the prevailing situation. 
 
 “In most cases, the inmates released from the shelter home end up in the streets. Hence we are trying to make them aware of the consequences if they come across angry mob,” he said, adding that in the recent past there had been no recorded instance of beggars or destitute kidnapping children, contrary to what the campaigns on social media suggest.
