Tirupur: Collector K S Palanisamy directed project director of district rural development agency (DRDA) to conduct inquiry into alleged swindling of about Rs 4.7 lakh by Nanjiyampalayam panchayat officials under MGNREGS.  The direction follows after villagers petitioned the collector on Monday. They claimed that the officials said that the money was used to dug a irrigation tank, which they did not find when they visited the place.  The incident itself came to light when the summary on annual expenditure was read at a gram sabha meeting conducted by panchayat secretary Nagaraj on May 18 at Nanjiyampalayam in Dharapuram taluk.  “The panchayat office said that about Rs 4.66 lakh was drawn from a government account for the tank at Chettikalam. But when we checked, we did not find it at the place or nearby areas. We believe that panchayat secretary Nagaraj along with former panchayat president Chithra had swindled the money,” said K S Raja, a BJP functionary from Dharapuram. “We also obtained evidence that Chithra and her husband Palanisamy had drawn daily wage of Rs 205 under MGNREGS without doing any work. Even the labourers worked under the scheme had drawn lesser wages,” he added. Meanwhile, when a few MGNREGS officials and panchayat secretary visited Chettikalam on Monday evening, villagers surrounded them and asked them to find the tank.
