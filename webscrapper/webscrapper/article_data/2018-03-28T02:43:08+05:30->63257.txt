 “An inquiry into the matter has been ordered through a three-member panel of the secretary, the chief town planner and the finance controller of  . The panel has been directed to submit its report in two weeks. A letter in this regard was issued three days ago. The next course of action will be taken on the basis of the panel’s report,” GDA vice-chairperson Ritu Maheshwari said on Tuesday.
 
 In 2015, the GDA had allowed the construction of buildings with stilt parking plus four floors in 13 areas, on the basis of amended building bylaws issued exclusively for   by the UP housing department. 
 
 These bylaws, issued in September 2014, covered plots measuring 112sqm to 2,000sqm. Two years later, however, the UP government had amended the rules for the entire state.
 
 Pockets within 13 residential colonies of Ghaziabad, including Indirapuram, Kaushambi and  , had been selected by the GDA for the implementation of the amended bylaws of 2014. 
 
 Residents of several other colonies in the city were excluded from the benefits of the building bylaws of 2014 on the list that was issued by the GDA under chairman Santosh Yadav. 
 
 They had alleged that the GDA hadn’t clarified the basis of the selection of the areas despite repeated representations.
 
 The amended building bylaws, which were issued for the entire state in June 2016, also covered Ghaziabad. According to these bylaws, stilt parking plus three floors were allowed on plot sizes measuring 150 to 300sqm while stilt parking plus four floors were allowed for plot sizes 300-2,000sqm.
