PATNA:  , a constituent unit of Magadh University, has decided to adopt Yarpur slum area for its all-round development. This decision was taken at the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) meeting held at the college here on Monday.

 College principal Sanjoy Kumar said the National Social Service (NSS) and NCC wings of the college would jointly launch development work in the slum area where thousands of downtrodden and underprivileged people have been living in hutments and dingy houses. “Children are deprived of proper literacy and healthcare,” he said.
 
 The college teachers would take part in the literacy and health awareness campaign besides organizing health camps at least once in a month in the slum area. Study materials would be distributed free of cost among the schoolgoing children, he said.
 
 A group of women teachers would take part in the health awareness drive for illiterate women. The college teachers would also make people in the slum area understand the ill-effects of liquor consumption. Though there is total prohibition in the state, the college would ensure it is being implemented strictly in this area, the principal said.
 
 He said the college is ready to arrange extra classes for deserving youths in the college. Kumar said he would personally interact with the ward councillors of the area to help the college adopt it fully.
 
 The college has chalked out various steps under the NSS scheme to give momentum to the ‘Swachh Abhiyan’ launched at the national level. The college has already declared the campus ‘no-smoking’, ‘no-tobacco’ and ‘no-plastic’ zone and would make the residents of the area aware of the need to maintain hygiene and eco-friendly atmosphere in the locality, he said, adding the college is well set for the second cycle of the NAAC in 2019 and its golden jubilee celebration in 2020.
