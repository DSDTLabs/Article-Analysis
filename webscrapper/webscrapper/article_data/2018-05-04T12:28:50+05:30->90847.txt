Mining baron G   is unfazed by the central   leadership's diktat to stay away from the party's campaign. He continues to campaign late into the night for his close associate, BJP's B  , in nearby villages, no questions asked.

 Between receiving visitors at the farmhouse, Reddy spoke to Naheed Ataulla and Mahendra Kumar about the campaign and the fight in the segment. Excerpts:
 
 
 
 I am confident of BJP's victory in Molakalmuru because Thippeswamy won in 2013 only by carrying around Sreeramulu's photograph on his campaign.
 
 
 
 I am camping in this farmhouse which is close to Ballari and Molakalmuru, and meeting party workers. I miss going to Ballari.
 
 
 
 I accompanied Lallesh to file his nomination papers, which is more than enough.
 
 
 
 I wanted to have cordial relations with Siddaramaiah and former PM   and had, therefore, invited them to my daughter's wedding. I went to give the invitation card to the CM only after confirming that I was given an appointment. Neither CM nor Gowda came for the wedding. Later, Siddaramaiah, at a public function in Chitradurga, said the wedding was a vulgar display of wealth. There was no need for him to say that as he did not come. Only people who have not seen a formal wedding of their family members can speak in this manner.
