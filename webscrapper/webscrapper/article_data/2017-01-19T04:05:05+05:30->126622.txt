MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday said it will direct all state government departments to warn employees not to travel in compartments reserved for the   on Mumbai’s local trains. A bench headed by Justice Abhay Oka, hearing a PIL, indicated that it will direct that government   or policemen booked by the Railway Police Force should be dealt with.

 The court heard a PIL by Nitin Gaikwad, who is 50% disabled and travels by Central and Western Railway to reach his Mahim workplace. He said he regularly suffered while boarding and alighting the coach due to unauthorized commuters, policemen, Government Railway Police and RPF personnel and railway staff travelling illegally in it.
 
 Advocate T J Pandian, appearing for the Railways, said RPF had taken action under Section 155 (entering into a compartment reserved) of the   Act. He said names of policemen have been sent to the police commissioner. Before passing directions, the court sought the state’s response on January 25.
