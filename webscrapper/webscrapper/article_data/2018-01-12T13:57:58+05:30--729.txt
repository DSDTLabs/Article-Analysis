Gregory David Roberts' "Shantaram", a 2003 novel about an Australian bank robber and heroin addict who escapes from jail and flees to Mumbai, will be adapted for a television series.

 The novel was earlier to be adapted as a feature film produced by   and with   as the director. But it was shelved.
 
 Now a production company has bagged the rights to the book, as well as to Roberts' 2015 sequel "The Mountain Shadow", reports an entertainment website.
 
 The book tells the story of a writer-turned-bank robber who escapes a maximum security prison in Australia and makes his way to Mumbai, where he begins a long search for love and redemption.
 
 "I'm honored and humbled in equal measure as a writer, and thrilled for the many readers who have hoped that a Shantaram' would become a vivid screen experience," said Roberts.
 
 "Television is the perfect medium for the novel.." he added.
 
 According to the website, Golin said he has been pursuing the property for more than a decade. Amy Powell called the book a "rich story that is so beloved by audiences worldwide."
