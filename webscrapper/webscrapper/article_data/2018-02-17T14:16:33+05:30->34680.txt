PANAJI: Contemporary painter   stressed on the democratization of the dissemination of art. A firm believer that art must be taken to the people, he said the government must consider making reproductions of great works of art available throughout the country. 

 “Sadly one finds that there’s a national gallery of modern art in Delhi with a huge collection and a certain number of reproductions, but unless you go there, see the works, and buy some reproductions, they won’t be available in any other city. Why can’t these reproductions be available in every town in India? This is something the government needs to think about,” he said on Friday at the D D   Festival of Ideas, “You don’t need to own a painting. People can appreciate it (art) if it is taken to them,” he said.
 
 He spoke of his exhibition of contemporary art, comprising 48 works of 30 artists he took to eight cities in  . Despite being blessed with many art colleges, people in the state, he found, had very little exposure of actual art. Unfortunately, sponsors are not keen on supporting more such travelling exhibitions, he said. Encouraging the public to pursue art, he told people not to be discouraged if they can’t draw or paint. “It’s no longer necessary to be a good draughtsman but to be a good artist,” he said. 
 
 When asked whether the country would see an Indian Mona Lisa, he said the popularity of the Mona Lisa had “not so much to do with that one work itself” but with the whole museum culture and the fact that France had a certain global position in the centuries gone by.
