Pune: Former chief minister and Congress leader Narayan Rane recently held separate meetings with BJP national president Amit Shah and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in New Delhi apparently to discuss his entry into BJP.

 BJP state president Raosaheb Danve, while speaking to reporters in Pune on Wednesday, said that “political discussions” took place when Rane met BJP national president Amit Shah. 
 
 However, Danve said that more details could be divulged only after discussion materialises further. “Rane had come to Delhi (on Monday). We had a meeting at my residence in presence of Fadnavis and state revenue minister Chandrakant Patil. After that meeting, Rane joined me and Patil to meet Amit Shah. Fadnavis was not present at the meeting as he had left on a foreign tour. Rane wanted to meet Shah to invite him to inaugurate a hospital in Sindhudurg. There were political discussions at the meeting, but I will reveal more only after discussion materialises further,” Danave said.
 
 Meanwhile, Danve claimed that MLAs from other parties were in “touch” with the BJP leadership. “In the recent presidential poll, BJP bagged 11 additional votes. This was a clear indication,” Danve said.
 
 Danve refuted claims of opposition parties that sentiments of people were against the government. The performance of the state government has been good so far, he claimed and. “The government has initiated developmental work and attracted highest foreign investment in recent past. Elections are litmus test to judge if people’s sentiments are with the government. In the recent polls, including Mira Bhayander civic polls, people have voted for BJP ,”he said.
