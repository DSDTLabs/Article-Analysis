INDORE: Nine-month-old ‘skeleton-thin’ child of   village is not only a case that remained out of the radar of woman and child development department (WCDD). The health department has found over 100 cases of severe acute malnourished children across district in last 20 days.

 Under the state government-run  , the health teams have found 102 severe acute malnourished children. Of them, 65 cases are from urban slums. During its door-to-door survey that started from June 15, the health teams found 12 acute malnourished children in Depalpur, four in Hatod and eight in Sanwer tehsil.
 
 In this duration of three weeks, 13 cases of severe acute malnutrition were found in Kajaligarh, which comes under Mhow tehsil.
 
 “Out of 102 severely acute malnourished children, we have admitted 37 children in nutrition rehabilitation centres ( ) as they needed immediate treatment,” the district immunization officer Dr Pravin Jadia told TOI.
 
 He said the number of malnourished children in Indore has become a matter of concern for the authorities. “After completing the survey, we will send the report to the state government as well as to the district collector. They will decide the further course of action,” said Dr Jadia.
 
 The district programme officer Dr   said, “In this financial year, we have found around 1,890 children under different stages of malnutrition. To treat them, a 14-day course in all six NRCs is being provided.”
 
 He said to improve bed occupancy and cure rate of Mhow NRC, which has been delivering low results in comparison to other NRCs of the district.
 
 While reviewing report card of all six NRCs in January, the then collector P   had found the performance of Mhow NRC below par. All the NRCs being operated across the district had managed to record around 100 per cent target of bed occupancy rate, while Mhow NRC failed to even cross the mark of 80 per cent. Besides, with about 44 per cent cure rate, the centre had maintained the last position in the table.
