CHANDIGARH: Punjab finance minister   said on Monday that a group of ministers would look at ways to start the much-touted, and delayed, bus rapid transport system (BRTS) in Amritsar.

 BRTS has been a non-starter even after two years of its launch and the state government spending Rs 450 crore on it. Badal made this annoucement while speaking during the ongoing budget session in Punjab assembly on Monday. The minister admitted to BRTS being a non-starter in most cities except Indore. He described BRTS, started by the previous SAD-BJP government in the state, as “ill-conceived and halfbaked”. “But now a lot of money has been spent on it, so a group of ministers will try to make it work,” he said.
 
 
 Local bodies minister   added that apart from 93 buses procured under BRTS, 60 others acquired under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) too were lying unused, as the company hired for BRTS had quit. “But we have a bank guarantee,” he said.
 
 Sidhu said if the finance department provided a running cost of Rs 30 crore, “an effort can be made to make it run with world-class standards”.
 
 Raising the issue with a calling attention notice, Congress   said there was no need for the project in the first place. “Substandard grills and other material habe been used and most of these items have come off,” he said.
 
 Datti pointed out that traffic congestion in Amritsar had worsened and around 40,000 more vehicles hit the roads after the beating the retreat ceremony gets over at Attari border. “Daily, the city is witness to 2-3 fatal accidents. The city’s roads are a mess,” he said.
 
 Amritsar BRTS is jointly funded by the Centre and Punjab on an equal-sharing basis. The project cost is Rs 495 crore. In December, 2016, partial operations of the BRTS were started. At present, nine buses are plying from India Gate to the   on the Verka route, said the   in his reply.
