Rajkot: A 34-year-old man was murdered while his friend was critically wounded in the foothills of Chotila town on Saturday night.  Police have arrested the accused Chatur Panchala for the crime. Panchala, a resident of Ajmer village in Vinchhiya taluka, had come to his mother’s house in Mafatiyapara near the foothills of Chotila to celebrate Holi and Dhuleti.  At around 10am, the victim Raju Surela and his friend Rupesh Sihora (24) were going on the road when Surela and Panchala collided with each other. This sparked a heated argument between the two during which Panchala brutally stabbed Surela and Sihora in their chest and back with the knife.  While Surela died on the spot, Sihora was shifted to Surendranagar civil hospital where his condition is said to be critical. Initially, police had lodged a plaint of murder against unidentified persons but Panchala’s name was revealed by Sihora after he gained consciousness on Sunday morning. Police immediately picked up Panchala from his mother’s house and arrested him.  Earlier, Surela’s family refused to accept his body saying they wanted the murderer to be arrested first. However, they accepted the body after Panchala was arrested. A B Gohil, PSI at Chotila police station, is investigating the case.
