PUNE: From grocers to bakers, owners of small businesses in the city are worried that the “abrupt and discriminatory” plastic ban will hit them hard.

 “The ban will not only be disruptive, it will also lead to more corruption,”   of   said while speaking at a conference convened on Thursday.
 
 During the conference, heads of various associations sought to know the alternative to their packaging needs if plastic was banned without proper planning.
 
 Through a notification issued on March 23, the state government had said manufacturing and sale of plastic (excluding some exempted categories) is banned forthwith. For disposing of available stock, the government has given one month to all the stakeholders, including consumers.
 
 The Maharashtra Plastic Manufacturers’ Association has already filed a writ petition in the Bombay high court, seeking a repeal of the ban. “In one stroke, the entire plastic industry has been rendered defunct. All units have running loans of crores of rupees. All of this will become non-performing asset if the ban is not lifted,”  , president of the association, said.
 
 He said the government is trying to make a scapegoat of the industry at a time when it has failed to take care of solid waste, including plastic.
 
 Retailers and food associations said the government has sent a contrasting signal through the notification. “On one hand, food inspectors say the food should be packed in plastics to prevent adulteration and from being spoilt. Now, they are saying it is banned,”  , executive president,  , said.
 
 Another thing that has ticked off the associations is the non-adherence to process. They say that the government did not invite and suggestions or objections as a part of the normal procedure.
