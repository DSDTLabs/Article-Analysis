AHMEDABAD: The two-day,   at the stateâ€™s only  ,  , which began on Friday, again established that the high water level at the lake was keeping birds away. Preliminary estimates enumerated by experts part of the census showed that the number of birds at the lake would go down and may even be the lowest count recorded since 2012. In 2012, around two lakh birds were recorded.

 Officials said the department plans to consider including birds in the vicinity, which may bring the number close to the count of 2016. In 2016, the there were a little over three lakh birds counted.
 
 Officials who are part of the census said that even in the second week of February, the lake still has five feet of water, which is too high for birds. The ideal water depth for most birds, including flamingos, is about two feet. Over the years, Nalsarovar has become much deeper due to seepage of water from irrigation canals, say birders and ornithologists who are part of the census.
 
  
 They say that there has been a drastic fall in the number of flamingos and other migratory birds at   in recent years. Officials pointed out that back in 2008, the flamingo population was estimated to be 11,580 which has registered a sharp decline and in 2016 there were only 3,859 flamingos recorded.
 
 This year too, the number may register a fall. The Nalsarovar census is held every two years by the forest department. Officials said the high water level has resulted in more birds at the   dam and at the small ponds at Charal and other villages.
 
 Officials said that over the years, the natural lake was being filled with excess Narmada water. Officials said that local species that can survive in high water are increasingly found at Nalsarovar. Geese and ducks, of which around 85,000 were found in 2008, registered an increase of 50% in 2016, with more than one lakh individuals. Flamingos have arrived in nearby ponds with less water and as they prefer a depth of about two feet.
