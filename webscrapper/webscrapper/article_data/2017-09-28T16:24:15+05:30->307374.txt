Born and brought up in Mumbai in a Bengali family,   became the beendani (daughter-in-law) of a Rajasthani family from Bikaner after getting married to polo player Shailendra Singh Rajput. She divides time between Jaipur, where her husband lives, and Mumbai which is her workplace. Her take on the long-distance marriage? "It’s good to stay away from your partner for a while as it keeps the excitement of meeting alive." She has a special connection with Delhi, too. When she was in the capital to promote her show ' ', she told us why she feels relaxed whenever she is to Delhi, the places she likes to visit and wants to explore in Delhi and her favourite shopping destinations in the city.

 Sangita keeps visiting Delhi, not just for work but for personal purposes as well. She says Delhi is more like a second home. "Though Delhi is also crowded, I don’t know why I feel more relaxed here. I like to roam around in Delhi, go shopping in Khan Market, attend polo matches during the polo season, as my husband plays polo, and visit our relatives who are in the army and live in the Cantt area. As Jaipur is so nearby, it's not a big deal coming to Delhi," she adds. During her initial days in the industry when Sangita used to visit Delhi she would love to shop dupattas from   Market, jewellery from Janpath and have Chinese food from a place she doesn’t remember anymore, in Defence Colony. She says, "I am a big foodie and a shopaholic. I remember, around fifteen years back, whenever I would visit Delhi, it was mandatory for me to go on a shopping spree. I had bought beautiful, colourful dupattas from Lajpat Nagar Market, chunky metal jewellery from Janpath Market and shoes from CP. I like to go to Khan Market as one gets everything there. For me the only place left to explore in Delhi is Old Delhi. I have never been to Paranthe Wali Gali in Chandni Chowk and want to go there soon. I have tried Karim’s in Mumbai and Jaipur but have never been to the original Karim's."

 While the Des Mein Nikla hoga Chaand actress always loved to eat, it was only after her wedding that she started cooking. She shares, "I had never cooked for myself or anybody else before my wedding. But after I moved to Jaipur I started cooking and love to cook now. My mother doesn't believe that I can cook." She has tried her hand at a number of cuisines, be it Rajasthani, Bengali or even Italian. She further adds, "While everyone at my husband’s home is a non-vegetarian, my mother-in-law is a vegetarian. I had made dishes for her without using onion and garlic, which surprised her as she used to think these two things are mandatory to make a dish taste good. I make Bengali dishes for her and Rajasthani dishes for my mother."

 Talking about the show 'Pehredaar Piya Ki' which stirred up a lot of controversy, Sangita thinks the industry today is not as sensitive as it used to be. She adds, "As an industry, we do not want to encourage such concepts like child marriage and regression. People like you and I, who live in cities and don’t have any idea about what happens in the rural areas of India, can find it regressive, but there might be places in the country where such customs are still prevalent."
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Ever since Sangita married Shailendra, she has fallen in love with people in Jaipur too. She loves their welcoming nature and the zeal to live life to the fullest. Sangita shares, "Though everything in Jaipur is lovable, I like the people the most. They are welcoming and know how to live life. They work hard but after the work is over they party harder, which makes them so lovable." The travel freak in her has made her explore Rajasthan. She says, "I have traveled to almost every place in Rajasthan except for Kota. While there are many cities and places in Rajasthan worth visiting, my favourite is Ranthambore. My husband has turned me into an animal lover and we love to visit   together for jungle safari."
