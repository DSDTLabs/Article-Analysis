SECUNDERABAD:   in   will sport new door number plates. For the first time,   (SCB) is following a unique method in fixing door numbers with red colour as background.

 SCB authorities have completed affixing door number plates in blue to nearly 50,000 residential properties in eight civilian wards a couple of months ago, but chose to affix red plates to commercial properties for easy identification.
 
 In Secunderabad Cantonment, there are nearly 20,000 commercial properties, including hospitals, hotels, bar and restaurants, lodges, on main roads and bylanes. Of them, 5,000 commercial properties were located on two major roads — State Highway No. 1 and National Highway No.44. Apart from these major roads, commercial properties are located on road stretches connecting Tabdund, Bowenpally, Trimulgherry, Karkhana, Bolarum and Alwal. “To easily identify category of property, assess  , issue trade licences and water bills, we have chosen to fix door numbers of commercial properties in ‘red colour’ and hope to complete the process by Mayend,” a senior SCB House Numbering project official told STOI.
 
 Once the process of fixing door numbers of commercial properties is over, then a draft copy of new house numbers (rationalisation of door numbers) of all properties would be tabled before the board meeting to pass a resolution by June-end, the official said.
 
 After the resolution is passed, residential and commercial property owners could start using the new house numbers for procuring government documents and correspondence, the SCB official said.
