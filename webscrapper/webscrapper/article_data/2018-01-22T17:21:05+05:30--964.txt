* Delhi high court will today hear the Aam Aadmi Party's appeal against the disqualification of 20 of its legislators by President   on the recommendation of the   (EC).

 "AAP has complete faith in the judiciary and will challenge this biased, illegal and illogical order of the Modi government in courts of law," party spokesperson Saurab Bharadwaj told PTI on Sunday.
 
 
 * Earlier, the Union Law and Justice Ministry issued a notification stating President Ram Nath Kovind has held that the 20 members of   stand disqualified under 15 (1) (a) of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) act.
 
 This came two days after the Election Commission wrote to the President recommending the disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs for holding office of profit while serving as parliamentary secretaries between March 13, 2015 and September 8, 2016.
 
 
 * If AAP fails to get reprieve from the courts, Delhi will have bypolls for the 20 seats within the next six months.
 
 
 * Chief minister   slammed the EC for an "extremely unconstitutional, unethical and biased decision" and accused the   of ochestrating the whole matter to harass AAP and its members.
 
 "They (BJP-led Centre) have tremendously victimised us by imposing fake cases on our MLAs. They conducted CBI raids on me and didn't get anything and today they declared 20 of our MLAs disqualified," Kejriwal said at a gathering in Najafgarh.
 
 
 * The AAP convenor observed that there was a silver lining to the dark cloud hanging over his party.
 
 "I have always said that it was God's grace. He also knew that after three years these people would declare 20 of our MLAs disqualified. That's why he gave us 67 seats out of 70 in the Delhi Assembly polls," Kejriwal tweeted.
 
  
  
 
 
 * This is true, as the AAP government retains its majortiy in the Delhi assembly with 46 MLAs in a House of 70. However, recontesting the 20 vacant seats in the upcoming by-elections may pose a challenge to the party, which is recovering from a string of electoral losses in other states.
 
 
 * While the BJP welcomed the president's decision and demanded Kejriwal's resignation on moral grounds, the   alleged that there was a deal between the BJP and the AAP due to which the EC delayed the disqualification recommendation by a month.
 
 
 * Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari demanded for repaying of the benefits enjoyed by the disqualified MLAs during their tenure as parliamentary secretaries.
 
 "People of Delhi feel that the Aam Aadmi Party MLAs must now return all financial benefits they were given from the day they were appointed as parliamentary secretaries," said Tiwari.
 
 
 * BJP leaders   and Shatrughan Sinha backed the AAP with the former saying the decison depicts "tughluqshahi" of the worst order.
 
 "President's order disqualifying the 20 AAP MLAs is complete miscarriage of natural justice. No hearing, no waiting for High Court's order. It is Tughluqshahi of the worst order," Yashwant Sinha tweeted.
 
  
  
 
 
 * Hours after the setback to AAP, rebel party leader Kapil Mishra said a new government will be formed in Delhi following the by-elections.
 
 "This is the win of Indian Constitution. Today, Arvind Kejriwal must have realised that nothing is bigger than the Constitution and law. Now, he also should not raise questions on the EVMs, the EC, and also President of India... he (Kejriwal) should be ready to face elections. Delhi will be going for elections soon and a new government will be formed," Mishra told news agency ANI.
