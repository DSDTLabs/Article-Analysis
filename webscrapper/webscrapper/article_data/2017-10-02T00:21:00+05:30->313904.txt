Panaji: Goa’s architecture has come to represent our cultural identity and evokes powerful memories of the historically rich past. But is the state doing enough to preserve it? While efforts are being made by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to maintain the dignity of many of Goa’s heritage buildings, intervention is required for heritage homes and spaces that people privately own in Goa, experts said. “For conservation related projects, there are very few professionally trained contractors or conservation architects in Goa. Their lack of knowledge results in short-term treatments which are rarely effective on old vernacular architectural styles,” said landscape architect Manguesh Prabhugaonkar. The treatment of each heritage building differs on parameters like the type of stone/material used, climate in the area, humidity levels, etc. There is no set pattern. Conservation architect Ketak Nachinolkar said that awareness and self-commitment towards maintaining their house is key to good restoration. “ Unless someone understands the science behind maintaining a heritage building, it is difficult to start work on it,” he said. Though one may argue that their house is private property, it is undeniable that it is also a vestige of history. “There are no government schemes at present for restoration of private homes” said director, archives and archaeology, Blossom Madeira.
