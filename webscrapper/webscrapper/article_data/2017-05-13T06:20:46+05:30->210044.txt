MEERUT: The Union minister of state for telecommunication  , on Friday, said that 2.5 lakh villages across the country will be connected with the internet by December 19 this year. Speaking at the launch of UP Madhyamik Shikshak Sangh’s website at the Krishak Inter College in Mawana here, the minister said, “We will connect as many as 2.5 lakh villages with internet by December 19 this year. Until now, 92,000 villages have been connected by means of optical fibre cable (OFC) under the Central government’s   Campaign.”
 
  The announcement came as a welcome initiative after the previous deadline of December 2018 set by the government. Under the National Optical Fibre Network project, renamed as BharatNet, the government plans to establish a network infrastructure by connecting all 2.5 lakh gram panchayats through OFC. Sinha also informed that 4G internet service provided by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) will be launched in a year’s time.
  
  “To bring improvement in the quality of education, teachers and students will have to work together. PM Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath are working to bring forth improvement in the field of education. It is only possible when teachers and students work together. There is not a single university from India listed in the top 100 varsities of the world. It is pertinent that we improve the standards of education and this will only happen when teachers come forward to work towards it,” said Sinha.
  
  The Union minister also pointed out laxity on the part of teachers in discharging their duties. “The UP board is lagging behind the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The teachers’ association will have to take more proactive roles in bringing forth changes,” he added to people in Mawana.
