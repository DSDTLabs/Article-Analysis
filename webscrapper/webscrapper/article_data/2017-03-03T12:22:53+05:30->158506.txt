' ' is a comedy romance flick coupled with elements of crime and thrill starring   and   in the lead roles. The movie is directed by Vamsi Krishna whereas Anup Rubens, the music director has provided a decent sound track to the movie. 

 The movie opens with a grand introduction of Arbaz Khan, who has comeback to Tollywood after a long gap and perfectly portrays the role of a baddie. Nagendra babu and Raghu babu can be seen playing pivotal roles in the film.
 
 Raj Tarun depicts the role of car mechanic who is also a pet dogs kidnapper. He earns a living by stealing dogs and plays the same old casual thug-like character he has been doing in all his past films. Anu Emmanuel could not put up a good show in the first half of the 2 hours 17 minutes film and her mediocre acting skills mars the movie considerably. However, comedian Snigdha who plays the role of Anu's friend does a commendable job with her epic comic timing and punches were the saving grace.
 
 An interesting twist in the pre-interval scene keeps the audience excited and eager for the second half of the movie. Nevertheless, the romance element of the movie has been disappointing and not up to the mark which results in a poor and non-engaging first half of the movie.
