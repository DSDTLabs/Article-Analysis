The fact that I have been a part of a citizens association has helped build close bonding with the neighbourhood. Unlike a candidate from any other political party which had their karyakartas campaigning for them, in my case it was residents from my area who went across the locality to campaign for me," said Makrand, whose electoral ward, 227 in Colaba, recorded the lowest voter turnout in Mumbai, 28.25%. But this was better than in 2012, when the same seat recorded a 23.47% turnout.
