Much has been spoken about   and Sanjana Chidanand’s camaraderie on   and the intrigue went up a notch further when Pratham, too, started showing interest in Sanjana. Now, here’s some news that will further pique your interest. Bhuvan, Sanjana and   are soon set to star in a TV series aptly titled Sanju Mattu Naanu. Having got a sneak peek at the promo, we can tell you that the makers of the series have rather cheekily used the real-life situation of the actors and deftly woven a plot around it. The promo features Bhuvan speaking of Sanjana rather endearingly, after which he proceeds to write the title Sanju Mattu Naanu on a white board. Soon, Pratham arrives on the scene to wipe away what Bhuvan has written and he writes his name instead. 

 “The makers were inspired by Quantico and approached us with the idea. Needless to say, I was thrilled. Having had a nightmarish experience while working on a TV serial some years ago, I had willed to never do daily soaps. The fact that this is a format that hasn’t been tried on Kannada   before is what drew me to it,” says Bhuvan. 
 
 So didn’t the opportunity to work with Sanjana, his reported lady love, also add to the allure? “I agree that Sanjana and I shared some tender moments on the reality show. My feelings and concern for her was genuine. In a house where you see the same faces every day, it’s not easy to stay sane. The situation makes you lean on people for your emotional needs and that’s what happened with Sanjana and me. But once you come out into the real world, it’s different. Sanjana and I don’t speak much to each other and we are not seeing each other as is being speculated. But as friends, it’d be fun to work with each other,” concurs Bhuvan. Also the fact that he and Pratham couldn’t and still can’t see eye to eye remains. “But we are professionals and this status quo is a personal one; it will not affect our work,” avers Bhuvan.
 We tried reaching Sanjana, who was unavilable till we went to print.
