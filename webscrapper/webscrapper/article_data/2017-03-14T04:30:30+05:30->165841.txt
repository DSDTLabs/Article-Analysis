CHENNAI: Police have launched a hunt for a gang which attacked a cop on duty and robbed him of Rs 4,000 in cash and his mobile phone on   in Urapakkam near   at around 11.30pm on Sunday.

 Passersby rescued the policeman who was identified as head constable Ramachandran attached to the Guduvanchery police station. Ramachandran suffered injuries on his hands and legs in the attack and was admitted to the SRM hospital in Kattankolathur near Nandhivaram.
 
 Doctors said that his condition is stable. Guduvanchery deputy superintendent of police S Mukilan and other police officers visited him at the hospital. Based on Ramachandran’s complaint, Guduvanchery police have registered a case and launched a hunt for the suspects.
 
 Preliminary inquiries revealed that Ramachandran, who was on night patrol, attended an emergency call after some residents complained of a gang harassing people walking on the road. Ramachandran rushed to the Railway Feeder Road near Urapakkam railway station on his bike and accosted the gang members who attacked him with a wooden stick. When the cop fell down, the gang beat him up further before stealing his valuables and fleeing.
 
 Shocked residents immediately alerted the police control room about the attack. Police personnel rushed to the spot and took Ramachandran to the hospital. Temporary check posts were formed to nab the suspects. However, they could not be traced. An investigation officer said, “The attackers may be residents of the same locality. We have collected CCTV footage recorded at shops in the locality.”
 
 A team of police personnel has been assigned to browse through the footage to trace the suspects. The injured policeman has identified some of the suspects and police teams have fanned out to nab them. “We are hoping to apprehend the attackers in a couple of days,” a senior police officer said.
