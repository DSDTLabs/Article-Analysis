AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat HC has given legal sanction to the marriage of a minor Muslim girl who had eloped with her 21-year-old lover, citing an earlier judgment enabling a Muslim girl to marry when she reaches puberty.

 But the couple’s union has been jeopardised by their desperate attempt to fortify their case. Apart from solemnising their nikah, the couple had also signed a livein relationship “contract”. This bid to secure double protection has put in trouble all who helped the couple. So while the youth got the HC’s protection when the girl’s father alleged abduction, the court now has directed the police to investigate charges against the youth after the girl’s father moved the HC demanding action against those involved in the preparation and notarising of the contract. The girl’s father has contended that a minor cannot legally enter into any agreement.
 
 Jainulabedin Ganji and the girl from Jamnagar eloped on November 9. The girl’s father lodged a complaint against Ganji for abducting the girl. Ganji moved the HC to have the charges quashed on the grounds that an HC order permits a Muslim girl to marry, if she so chooses, when she reaches puberty.
 
 On November 22, Justice J B Pardiwala directed police not to arrest the youth but allowed investigation.
 
 To be doubly sure, the couple had sent a copy of their live-in relationship agreement to the girl’s family which was accompanied by a notarised affidavit. Following this, the girl’s father moved HC, which ordered a fresh probe.
