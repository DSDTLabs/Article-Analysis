PUNE: The   ( ) will prepare a development plan of 7,800 hectare area to be transferred by the state government for making it financially sustainable.

 With big-ticket players from  , Korea and Singapore queueing up with investment proposals, a special drive to fence the land and keep those free of encroachments will be taken up on a priority basis, new PMRDA chief Kiran Gitte said on Tuesday.
 
 The PMRDA will emulate the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) model that includes planning and executing the development projects. The financial model rests heavily on its land bank with the authority using it to raise funds and implement various projects.
 
 Addressing a news conference here, Gitte said a one-year-plan to fence these land will be drawn. Even if it calls for an investment of Rs 4-5 crore for fencing, the plots have to be made commercially viable for projects such as metro rail and ring road, he said.
 
 The land bank, similar to the one carved out for the MMRDA, will be spread over 10 talukas in Pune district. District collectorate officials said the PMRDA region has nearly 6,000 hectare of grazing land and 1,800 hectare land belonging to various government institutions. 
 
 The idea is that after civic amenities such as roads, lights, water and sewage are developed, land prices will go up and the income generated from the sale or commercial use of the land is used for development.
 
 The proposal for creating the land bank was pending since the formation of the PMRDA in 2015. Gitte said the   to be transferred to PMRDA has been approved on paper and the work on transfer of title into the record of rights remains. 
 
 The officer said he was keen to work on a “Hinjewadi hub” model in the region to draw maximum investors and implement the PMRDA projects.
