PANAJI: Goa with its 101km of coastline that attracts tourists for its sun and sand has a dubious distinction of throwing up 41kg of beach litter per head, the highest in the country, with every square metre of the beach sand containing 25.5gm of plastic waste and 68gm of glass bottles, mostly of alcoholic beverages.

 
 
  
 
 
 But more than the plastic waste and glass bottles, it was the nylon nets and fishing lines that created litter on the state’s beaches with 75.7gm per square metre. Goa also topped in the quantity of beach debris with 205.8gm per square metre of garbage found on its sands.
 
 The only solace that the state could find was that its beaches did not have any electronic waste.
 
 “Samples of debris collected from beaches revealed that all the items were domestic and anthropogenic discards,” says a study conducted by Kochi-based Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute.
 
 Plastic and other non-biodegradable synthetic materials are the common groups of debris responsible for degradation of marine habitats.
 
 The results of the study showed that litter became an integral part of the beach ecosystem and proved some connection between beach litter and coastal urbanisation or tourism activity, especially in Goa and  .
 
 “Increasing urbanisation of coastal settlements as well as tourism development has resulted in unprecedented production of anthropogenic waste,” it says. The increased littering on the beaches has mainly been due to greater dependence on tourism. “Coastal litter impacts in multiple ways. Most importantly, they degrade the quality and health of our oceans, damage coastal and marine habitats and harm marine biota,” the study says.
