 and Oindrila Sen- starrer   that opened to good ratings on   charts is at an interesting point.   (played by Vikram) has proposed marriage to ladylove Mahul (played by Oindrila) although his family has arranged his marriage with another girl. Will Mahul take Ayandeep on on the proposal or will she decline? Viewers are waiting with bated breath to find out the turn the serial is set to take. It is interesting to note that the show has emerged a slot leader, garnering the highest TRP at the 8.30 pm slot. The daily soap that chronicles the lives of Mohul, Anurup and Ayandeep, has been lapped up by audiences since it went on air.
