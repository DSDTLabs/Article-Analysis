DARJEELING: For the first time ever, the crew of a Telugu film has started shooting in Darjeeling. Almost 30% of the film — ‘Raja the Great’ — starring Ravi Teja, also known as Mass Maharaja in the south, and actress Mehreen Kaur Pirzada, who starred in the recent Bollywood film ‘Phillauri’, will be shot in the Hills.

 Darjeeling is always known for its bonding with both the Tollywood and Bollywood as far as shooting of films is concerned. Among the recent Bollywood films shot in the Hills are ‘Yaariyan’ in 2014 and ‘Barfi’ in 2012. Recently, three Bengali films — ‘Ami Joy Chatterjee’ by Manoj Michigan, ‘Chhaya o Chhobi’ by Kaushik Ganguly and ‘Porokiya’ by   — were also shot in the Hills. This Telugu film crew is the latest to join the bandwagon.
 
 Directed by Anil Ravipudi, the film will be shot in Darjeeling over 15 days at St Paul’s School, Mirik (lake) and the forests of Sukna. An action sequence will also be shot in Chowrasta. 
 
 On Tuesday, a song sequence with Teja and Pirzada was shot at Lebong Cart Road.
 
 Both the director and the lead actor, however, refused to divulge the storyline of the film. “You will have to watch the film for that,” Ravipudi said. “The film has everything from drama to emotion to comedy and great action,” said Teja.
 
 Bollywood blockbuster ‘Main Hoon Na’ starring Shah Rukh Khan was also shot in the Hills. Director of ‘Barfi’, Anurag Basu, also shot parts of his upcoming film ‘Jagga Jasoos’ — starring   — in Darjeeling. Parts of Vidya Balan-starrer ‘Kahanai 2’ were also shot in the Hills. 
 
 Ravipudi said, “If this film becomes a hit, then more directors from the south will come here to shoot their films.” 
 
 ‘Raja the Great’, reportedly inspired from Chinese romantic-comedy ‘Blind Detective’, is produced by Dil Raju under the banner of Sri Venkateswara Creation. It’s set to release either in August or September.
