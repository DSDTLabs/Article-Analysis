KOCHI: The   department here is organizing a ‘GST refund fortnight’ that began on Thursday to quickly sanction pending refunds to exporters. As much as Rs 150 crore of   (IGST) refunds are pending for exports though the Cochin port, due to technical errors.

 According to customs officials, GST is imposed on all supply of goods and services. However, GST paid for export is refundable. The amount, which can go up to 18% of the consignment’s value, usually would be automatically refunded once the system matches the invoice number on the shipping bill at the time of export and at the time of filing a GST return.
 
 
 “Problems associated with sanction of IGST has been frequently addressed by issuing guidance, circulars, FAQs, advertisements, amendments in law et al to tackle refund errors. However, some errors, mostly data entry errors, have delayed the process of distributing the refunds,” said an officer.
 
 Exporters were not able to get this amount mainly due to technical errors they themselves committed, they can now clear the errors and get the refund within days as part of the drive.
 
 “Assistant commissioner   has been designated as a special officer for this purpose. Exporters are requested to get in touch with him for clarifications so that errors can be removed and IGST refund claims dispersed,” said customs commissioner  .
 
 The facilities have been made available for sanctioning of IGST refunds held up due to mismatch in invoice related information provided in shipping bill and   return table 6A and errors associated with filing of export general manifest (EGM) in gateway port, said M S Suresh.
