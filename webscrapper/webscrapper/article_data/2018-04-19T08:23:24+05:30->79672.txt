BENGALURU: It’s summer and water tankers have become a common sight in the city. The requirement is being felt even in areas which receive   as residents complain of erratic supply. However, the   ( ) officials claim there is nothing to worry about in the coming months.

 BWSSB chairman   said the agency was better positioned this year to deliver the required water, thanks to the torrential downpour last year.
 
 “Last year’s monsoon helped fill up the reservoirs. There will be   to the areas that we are already servicing. Compared to the previous year, we are pumping 50 million litre per day (MLD) this year. Last summer, we supplied around 1,320 MLD and we are presently supplying almost 1,380 MLD of water. We can increase this to 1,400 MLD in May by pumping more water,” he said.
 
 Girinath said BWSSB would have no trouble supplying the amount of water that they are committed to as per the Cauvery Water Supply Scheme (CWSS). As for the 110 villages acquired in 2007, he said the agency will be able to supply water only by 2023, when the fifth stage of CWSS will be completed.
 
 “It will take us some more time to service those areas. They are largely dependent on underground water,” the BWSSB chief added.
 
 BWSSB had kept 68 water tankers on standby last year because of the severe drought. “The need was greater at that time and thus we had tankers on standby. This year, there is no need,” he said.
