BENGALURU: Bharat Ratna CNR Rao called for creativity in science to create interest among children, rather than focus on examination and marks. Speaking at the launch of   (NIAS) Maiya Prodigy fellowship for students on Friday, he said: “Getting 100100 in every examination is not a good thing as it shows that you are not thinking. Every idea is a sapling that will lead to forests, which in turn will lead to continents of science. Thinking needs to be constant. Science is interpretative and every scientist is different. There is no classroom for creativity, but we can create an atmosphere,“ he said.

 The noted scientist's advice to students was not to be enamoured by high salaries and increments but to choose a field where they can excel. “I never bothered about money .Only those who publish regularly get recognized. As for me, the day I stop publishing is the day I die,“ he said.
