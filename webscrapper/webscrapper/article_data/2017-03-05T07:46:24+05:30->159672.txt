CHENNAI: Two robbers, who hatched a plan to target   while in Puzhal prison, stuck to the strategy after coming out and struck at two salons on Friday. 

 Their luck ran out after the third strike, in   and Muthu Kumar, 35, and Kombaiya Pandian, 45, were caught . They are back in jail and police are looking for two others who helped them.
 
 At the parlour in Avadi, they barged in with their faces covered with kerchiefs. At gunpoint, they snatched a gold chain worth 23,000 and 20,000 in cash from the employees and escaped in a white Maruti Ritz. 
 
 "One of the women in the parlour managed to note the car's registration number and alerted the police control room," said deputy commissioner, Ambattur, R Sudhakar. Police at nearby check points were alerted and a team at the Avadi bus stand caught the duo. 
 
 During interrogation, police found Kumar was one of those who hijacked an ATM cash van containing 1.80 crore in   last year, while Pandian was arrested in January after robbing several beauty parlours with eight others. 
 
 Until two years ago, Pandian ran a prostitution racket at a   spa he owned until the anti-vice squad busted it and the spa was shut down.
 
 Later, the native of Nanguneri in   district, rented rooms in Vadapalani and went on a spree of robbing women at beauty parlours in places like Ramapuram and Arumbakkam.
 
 After his arrest in January, he met Kumar in the Puzhal prison and they tow became friends. 
 
 Pandian explained how they could make easy money by targeting women's beauty salons. Kumar agreed and the two, who came out of prison separately last week, decided to execute the plan.
 
 They probably reasoned that targeting such places would be risk free as there were no men around, an officer said. 
 
 "A majority of women who come to beauty parlours take off their jewellery and leave it unattended," said the officer.
