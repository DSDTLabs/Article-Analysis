AHMEDABAD: In an ambitious move, the state   department will be launching a 24-hour fever helpline later this week for the state. The service can be accessed by dialling ‘104’. It will provide service to both cities and rural areas. 

 Upon call, a paramedic staff from nearby stations will visit homes and take blood samples for rapid tests and provide reports within a prescribed period to citizens. 
 
 The   is already chalking out a strategy for implementation of the programme. 
 
 “One of the main beneficiaries will be patients affected by vector-borne diseases, as they will come to know early symptoms and effective treatment that can be given,” said a senior AMC health official. 
 
 The AMC will require a staff of more than 600 to cater to emergency calls. “Along with malaria, diseases like typhoid, cholera, and other such waterborne diseases will also be detected early,” said the official.
