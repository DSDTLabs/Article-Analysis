Child artist Rupam Mondal, all of 5-years-old, who plays   in  ,offered   for the first time this year. And boy did he enjoy taking part in the rituals! Speaking to us, the popular kid on TV shared how his   went. Here's what he had to say...

 "This is the first time that I offered anjali to   wearing dhoti and panjabi. Baba bought me new clothes for the occasion. I prayed to god that I get full marks in exams all year and can also act well. Every year, my mother cooks khichuri and this year too we had that with beguni. At night, I had a para function where I danced and recited a poem too. I had invited my friends and we played all evening. Going by what they say, you shouldn't study on Saraswati Puja, I didn't study at all!"
