SALEM: Amid the instances of suicide among police personnel, BJP state president Tamilisai Soundararajan has suggested that chief minister   meet them in person and address their issues. 

 Speaking to reporters after a party meeting at   in Salem district on Thursday, she said 20 police personnel had committed suicide in the last five months. “How police would give protection to people when they don’t feel secure,” she said. 
 
 On T T V Dhinakaran’s new political outfit, Tamilisai took a dig at its’s name,  , saying that people were confused whether it was a party or a political forum or a wing of a party. “Dhinakaran’s party will not make any impact in the state politics. Besides his intentions are not to do any good for the people, but to dissolve the state government,” she added.
 
 On Stalin’s boycott of budget session due to the government’s inaction in the Cauvery issue, she said that the BJP did not care about his activities in the assembly. tnn
