KANNUR:  , the collective of the local residents of  , a CPM village in the suburbs of   in   district, have strengthened their agitation and threatened to immolate themselves if the national   ( ) decides to go ahead with the bypass project through their paddy fields.

 The residents, who have locked horns with the CPM leadership over the acquisition of paddy fields for the NH bypass, asserted that they would not permit the survey and came to the paddy fields raising slogans. Some of them even poured kerosene on their body and threatened that they would immolate if at all the police entered the field to arrest them.
 
 The agitation has been strengthened by Vayalkilikal, even as the CPM claimed that the collective has no support of the residents, as most of them have supported the bypass project and even gave their consent letter. The party had paraded around 50 people in a press conference on Tuesday, claiming that they were all residents of Keezhattur.
 
 But the local collective claimed that the CPM’s claim was fake, and the people’s support for the fresh round of agitation might become a headache to the CPM leadership.
 
 According to Keezhattur residents, they are not against development, as accused by the CPM. But reclaiming the paddy fields will affect the water resources and agriculture there, apart from affecting the local ecosystem.
 
 “When there are alternatives, why the authorities are adamant of building the bypass through the paddy fields,” asked Suresh Keezhattur, a local resident who is at the forefront of the agitation. The residents alleged that the bypass is being built to help the land mafia.
