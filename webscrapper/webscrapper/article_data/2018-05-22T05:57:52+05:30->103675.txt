MUMBAI: Citizens groups have demanded the state government release the sheets, report and maps that are meant to accompany the Development Plan (2034) report for which suggestions and objections have been invited by June 7.

 
 “Without these sheets and maps, it is not possible to read the DP. These reveal the locations of plots and reservations. The government should release the documents and start the one-month period for suggestions and objections only after that,” said   of the  . The body had organized a public meeting to discuss the problems in the DP.
 
 However, officials clarified that the DP maps have been delayed as the government is rectifying errors and that the onemonth period for feedback will be counted only from the date of their release.
 
 Joshi also pointed out that the DP was provided only in English, and not in Marathi or Hindi. Among the concerns raised at the meeting was the rise in discretionary powers of the civic chief in the proposed   (DCRs). These seek to allow the civic chief the power to change zoning, the boundary of a zone and the relocation of a reservation. It suggests an official can with special permission even change modalities for development permission including online approval. The civic chief is also allowed to overrule heritage committee suggestions.
 
 “The DCRs give the civic chief sweeping powers beyond the parent Act, the MRTP Act. This may not even be legally tenable,” said Joshi.
 
 Architect   who was earlier part of the state heritage committee said the government had ignored its own planning committee’s report based on suggestions given by citizens after the revised draft DP. Citizens also raised objections to the exclusion of slums and gaothans in the DP.
 
 Joshi also questioned the rationale for waiving the submission of sale and ownership documents and title clearance certificates for property transactions by claiming that this would boost ease of business.
