BENGALURU: Amid reports that Udupi-Chikkamagaluru MP   Karandlaje had declined to return to state politics by contesting the May 12 assembly polls, the anti-Yeddyurappa faction in the   on Sunday claimed that she was interested in her candidature, but the party’s central leadership had decided against it.

 Sources said the party leadership in New Delhi on Sunday reportedly conveyed a message to   that barring him and Ballari MP B Sreeramulu, no other MP in   should be allowed to contest the May 12 assembly polls.
 
 Koppal MP   and Karandlaje were contemplating contesting the assembly elections in a desperate attempt to return to state politics. While Sanganna wanted to contest from Koppal, Karandlaje was an aspirant from Yeshwantpur in Bengaluru. Karandlaje reportedly kept her aspirations a secret and had planned to file her nomination papers on April 24, the last date for filing nominations.
 
 On Sunday, party sources said Yeddyurappa decided against fielding Karandlaje and pacified a disgruntled Sanganna by giving ticket to his son Amaresh Karadi to contest from Koppal.
 
 The BJP had earlier cleared the name of C V Chandrashekar from Koppal. Sanganna had put forth his claim to contest in the wake of reports that Karandlaje was also being allowed to contest from Yeshwantpur.
 
 Following this, the anti-Yeddyurappa faction had complained to the party leadership that Karandlaje should not be allowed to contest assembly election as Yeddyurappa had ignored senior party leaders and allowed her to function as de facto state party chief. Yeddyurappa’s dependence on Karandlaje in taking important decisions was hurting the unity in the party, they claimed.
 
 Over the last six months, Karandlaje has been actively campaigning for the party and single-handedly defending Yeddyurappa even as several party leaders were involved in a bout of shadow-boxing with him. “The leaders are unhappy since she has been calling the shots,’’ party sources said.
