There has been a lot of speculation about Vijay Sethupathi’s movie,  . However, it has been revealed that the actor will be playing, Ayya, an actor and stage performer. The highlight is that he will be seen playing three different age groups — that of a 75, 50 and 30-year-old. According to a source, “The 75-year-old character that Vijay will be playing is the lead character and what happens in his life forms the story. To make him look like a 75-year-old, the team will be flying to Los Angeles to meet the well-known makeup artiste, Greg Cannon. Greg has won three Academy Awards for the movies Mrs. Doubtfire, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Bram Stoker’s Dracula. 

 Sethupathi’s look has been finalised by Viswanath Sundaram, but the team wants the prosthetics to be done, too. This will be a new experience for Sethupathi as well,” says the source. Greg has also worked with Shah Rukh Khan for Fan and Rishi Kapoor for the movie, Kapoor And Sons. This will be the actor’s 25th film that is being directed by Balaji Tharaneetharan. The duo had previously worked together in Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom.
