AHMEDABAD: A   of the   (NCB) nabbed three persons including a woman with 9kg of   (hashish). While two persons were arrested from  , one accused was apprehended near the APMC in Vasna.

 NCB officials said that working on information, a team kept watch at Hotel Kinara on Relief Road on February 14.
 
 “A woman, identified as Tabassum Razzaq, 38, a resident of Kalyan, had come with 7kg of charas. She was accompanied by her 14-year-old daughter. When Naseeruddin Shaikh, 57, a resident of Juhapura, went to collect the consignment he and Razzaq were apprehended. On questioning them, we learned that a portion of the consignment was meant for Iqbal Mansuri, 38, a resident of Dholka,” said Hari Om Gandhi, zonal director of the NCB. Gandhi said Mansuri was caught near APMC on the basis of information. “Mansuri was in possession of an additional 2.5kg of charas, taking the total seizure to 9.5kg. Mansuri had been provided the contraband by the same supplier. However, as he was not happy with the quality, 2kg of the stock with Razzaq was meant for him, as an exchange,” he said.
 
 NCB officials said that according to Razzaq’s statement, she frequently visits Ahmedabad. She would board a bus to the city and conceal the drugs in her luggage. She said that her husband is ill and she started smuggling drugs to sustain her family. This is one of the few instances where a woman drug mule has been apprehended.
 
 “Shaikh and Mansuri have both been in the trade for more than a decade and were known as wholesale suppliers. Their questioning will throw light on the intricate drug networks in the city and Gujarat. Gujarat is generally a transit point, but what is new is that suppliers are sourcing the drug from Mumbai,” said an official.
