In a one-page letter to the President on behalf of the  , Engineer has said alleged statements by Yogi—on how Muslim women’s bodies should be pulled out of their graves and raped—are comments unbecoming of a person about to occupy the chief minister’s office.

 Engineer, who sent his letter by facsimile to the President’s office on Saturday, also said that on the one hand, BJP had pitched itself as a savour of Muslim women by taking up the issue of Triple Talaq, on the other, it was appointing as CM a person who had made an anti-women statement of this nature.
