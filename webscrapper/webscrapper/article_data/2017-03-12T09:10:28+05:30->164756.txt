KOLKATA:   resident Debarpan Mukherjee, who is admitted in a hospital in New York after suffering brain haemorrhage on Thursday, remained critical on Saturday. 

 His uncle Kaushik Munshi, who took a flight to New York on Saturday morning, was yet to reach his destination till late in the evening, but other relatives and Debarpan’s friends informed his parents that there is no improvement in his condition. 
 
 External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj had posted a series of tweets, assuring all help to Debarpan’s parents.
 
 “We spoke to his friends in the morning. They said he continues to be critical and there is no improvement in his condition,” said Aparajita Chatterjee, Debarpan’s maternal aunt. 
 
 Debarpan’s mother Tinku has not been keeping well ever since she heard of his brain haemorrhage. “She has been crying incessantly and also fainted several times,” said Chatterjee.
 
 An alumnus of Hindu School, Debarpan studied at Netaji Subhash Engineering College, after which he worked for Intel,   and TCS. He left for New York last September to pursue his Masters at New York University. On Thursday morning, he suddenly collapsed in his hostel. At the hospital he was detected with brain haemorrhage. 
 
 Some of Debarpan’s friends tweeted to Swaraj, who promptly put out three tweets saying her office was in touch with Debarpan’s mother and that they would help his parents reach New York at the earliest. She also promised that the   in New York “will provide all help”.
