Meerut: A massive fire broke out at a power loom factory situated in Meerut’s Lisari Gate area on Sunday morning. As many as three fire tenders were rushed to the spot to douse the blaze which continued for over an hour’s time. Fire department officials say prima facie it looks like the fire was triggered by a short circuit.   Though no one was injured, factory owner said the power loom machines had burnt down in the incident and estimated financial loss worth lakhs.    Giving details, Meerut chief fire officer Ajay Kumar Sharma said, “The incident took place at 10 am in an ‘unregistered’ power loom factory in Lisari Gate area on Sunday. Three fire tenders were rushed to the spot but one of them could not reach it because the factory is situated in a crowded area with serpentine lanes. Due to this, the dousing of the fire became a difficult task.”    It took at least one and a half hours to douse the fire. Sharma added, “Prima facie, it looks like a short circuit led to the fire but the picture will be clear only once proper investigation is done – which is underway.”    The incident came to the fore when Munna, the factory owner who lives in a house adjacent to the unit, woke up to the smell of fumes and found his factory burning. “As many as eight power loom machines and cloth worth lakhs got burnt in the fire. I am collating the losses and will submit them to the police. My losses could have been reduced had the fire department been able to douse the fire properly by bringing all fire tenders in place,” said Munna (who goes by his first name).
