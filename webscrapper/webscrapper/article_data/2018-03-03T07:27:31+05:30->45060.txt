HYDERABAD : A month after the completion of the tender process for a mega drinking water reservoir which has a capacity of 10 TMC at   village of   mandal, the state government has not taken a decision to award the work to the successful bidder.

 January 18 was the last date for filing e-tenders. The same day tenders were opened for evaluation. This was thesecond time that tenders were called for Keshavapuram reservoir project. When the Hyderabad   (HMWS&SB) invited tenders for the first time, there was no response. Since the work involved was huge, the water board was finding it difficult to get experienced contractors.
 Only two firms responded when the board called for tenders for the second time. Board officials forwarded the tenders to a committee to award the work. Highly- placed sources in HMWS&SB told TOI that the tenders committee decided to award the work Mega Engineering & Infrastructure Limited (MEIL).
 
 Normally, after the tender committee finalises the successful bidder, the government issues a GO. But in Keshavapuram reservoir issue, there has been no progress till date. Officials of MA&UD and HMWS&SB claim that they do not know where the file has got stuck. “The board has already issued ‘Letter of Acceptance’ (LOA) to the bidder to pay bank guarantee of Rs 98 crore before entering into an agreement to commencethework. We are waiting for the reply,” HMWS&SB chief general manager and incharge of Keshavapuram reservoir, P   toldTOI.
 
 The total cost of the drinking water reservoir is Rs 4,777 crore and the firm has to pay Rs 98 crore to the water board as bank guarantee. Delay in processof bank guaranteecouldbe the main reason, hesaid.
 
 During water board’s survey on land acquisition, 1,572 hectares were identified. Of this, 1,200 hectares is private land, and 372hectaresfallunder reserve forest. The board sent a letter to the principal chief conservator of forests seeking handing over of the reserve forest.
