GUWAHATI: Machkhowa has turned the spotlight on this locality in the city for presenting a unique face of Durga Puja transcending communal barriers and setting a shining example of harmony.

 Members of both Hindu and Muslim communities come together to celebrate this puja, much in tune with Indian traditions. This year too, the two communities have got down to organising the puja.
 
 Established in 1981, the   has had its fair share of ups and downs. First, there was a change in the venue.
 
 From a small garage where the puja started, it was later shifted to a narrow lane near the old venue.
 
 The members of the Muslim community have a big role to play in the puja: they design and set up the pandal, collect chanda (donations), run errands, collect bamboos and leaves for rituals and most importantly, serve the traditional bhog (food offered to the goddess).
 
 "Ever since the puja started here, we have been working together to make the festival a grand success. We take part in all the activities. We even cooperate during the process of Belboron, for which we collect bamboo stems and other items," said  , a resident of Machkhowa.
 
 The onus of the committee members is now to continue with the tradition and later pass it on to the new generation. The puja has undergone a transformation over the years. It has become even more gorgeous and the budget has gone up. But the tradition has not changed.
 
 "We like to work together. Our Muslim friends help us. We are proud of this spirit of cooperation," said Samikhya Das, a chartered accountant and resident of Machkhowa.
 
 This spirit of cooperation is visible at some other venues as in west Guwahati where Hindus and Muslims organise pujas.
