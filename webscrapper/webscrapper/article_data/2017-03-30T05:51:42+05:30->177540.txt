INDORE: Atal Indore City Transport Services Ltd ( ) is set to introduce eight new buses between Gangwal and DAVV   from the first week of April.

 Officials with AICTSL said that these buses will be the midi-bus type, meant to cover three areas prone to dense traffic in the city.
 
 AICTSL CEO Sandeep Soni said, “We have applied for a permit along these routes, and hope to start running these buses between Gangwal to DAVV Khandwa road.”
 
 “All three routes have been earmarked as ‘core routes’. We have already started operating such buses on three core routes, Khajrana to Rajwada, Kalani Nagar to MY Hospital and Banganga to MY Hospital,” he said.
 
 The company operates eight buses between Khajrana to Rajwada. Four run from Kalani Nagar to MY Hospital and four from Banganga to MY Hospital. The company has plans to run 24 midi-buses on these routes. Officials had earlier planned to run normal city buses on these routes, but after finding it difficult due to regular traffic, they decided to settle with midi-buses which are smaller.
 
 AICTSL will also extend its air-conditioned interstate bus service from Indore to Pune. It also has plans to introduce this service between Indore and Mumbai. The company has plans to introduce four sleeper coach buses. Two from Indore to Mumbai, and another two from Indore and Pune.
