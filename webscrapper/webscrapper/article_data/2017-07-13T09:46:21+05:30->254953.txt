It's around the release of his movie 'Welcome to Central Jail' in 2016 that actor Dileep announced about his next project, 'Professor Dinakan.'

 A bunch of Dinkoists in Kerala, who follow a parody religion and believe in their 'ultimate god' Dinkan, had staged a protest against the title of the movie in front of the actor's renowned restaurant, soon after. Now that Dileep is jailed in the case of the actress assault, the Dinkoists claim that it's all because he insulted the all powerful Dinkan! 
 
 
 
 "We don't believe in chopping someone's head or hands off for not respecting our religion, so only protested in peace. Moreover, we are of the view that people engage in such activities when their gods aren't powerful enough. However, as Dinkan is the supreme power, we kept quiet and just kept praying. As it had to happen, Dileep is now behind bars for his karma," says the post on the page of Dinkoists.
 
 Many interesting comments followed, laced with sarcasm and praising 'Dinka Daivam.' "This episode will be a lesson for all who opposes  ," says the page, as they also urge everyone to forget other gods and join the religion.
