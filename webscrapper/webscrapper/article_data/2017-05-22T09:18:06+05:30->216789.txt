NEW DELHI: Two people, including an 18-year-old, were   as heavy showers lashed the capital on Sunday evening. 

 At   in Shahdara, Robin Thomas, a Class XII student at a missionary school, and two friends took shelter in front of a shop while returning from   but an overhead wire soon snapped and fell in a puddle near them. His friends told the police that to go to a safer place, they stepped into the puddle. While two of them wearing shoes were saved, Thomas who was wearing slippers got electrocuted. On hearing their calls, locals came running but Thomas was declared brought dead at a hospital. 
 
  His father is a businessman based in Dubai and the mother works as a nurse at GTB Hospital. A case of causing death due to negligence has been registered. Near Lajpat Rai Market, a 50-year-old man died after being electrocuted by a stray wire. The police are yet to identify him. A probe has been ordered. 
 
 A BSES spokesperson said preliminary reports indicated that the live wire snapped as a tree fell on it during a dust storm. The other person came into contact with an illegal wire being used for power theft, he added.
 
 At  , a makeshift shack collapsed on eight labourers sleeping inside it. They are out of danger.
