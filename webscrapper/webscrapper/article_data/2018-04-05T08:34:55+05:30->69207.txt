AHMEDABAD: The Fee Regulatory Committee issued notices to 200 schools in Ahmedabad district for not communicating with FRC about their fees structures on Wednesday. 

 Delhi Public School, Bopal, on the other hand, refused to promote students who have not paid their fees.
 
 On Wednesday, as the school displayed the list of those promoted, about 100-odd parents, who had not paid their fees, found the names of their wards missing from the list. 
 
 When the parents inquired, the management asked them to pay up fees in full.
 
 Gaurav  , a parent, said, “We had written letters to the school management asking them to accept 50% of the fees decided by the school. The parents are also willing to give an undertaking that they will pay the excess amount fixed by the FRC.”

 The school even cancelled transportation of students to pressurize their parents.
 
 Sonal Patolia, whose son studies in  , said, “I was surprised when I did not find my son’s name on the list. Not only my son, but the names of several students were missing.” The school was not neither promoting the students nor giving the school leaving certificates, she said.
 
 Surendra Sachdeva, principal of DPS Bopal refused to answer calls. Later, when asked, he asked back whether we knew of any student given school leaving certificate over the issue. He refused to reply when asked why several students had not been promoted to higher classes.
