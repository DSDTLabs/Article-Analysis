AHMEDABAD: The fact that he wielded a   and no   of his actions is available helped 30-year-old Kamlesh Sharma bail on Tuesday, a day after he was arrested on the charges of attempting a bank robbery.

 An   was registered against Sharma on Monday for storming into the Nikol branch of the   with a fake gun and demanding cash from the bank staff. However, when he was produced before the Mirzapur rural court on Tuesday afternoon, the investigating officer did not seek his remand. The police did not even mention CCTV footage when Sharma requested the court for bail.
 
 Sharmaâ€™s advocate Anand Brahmbhatt highlighted the point that the police did not produce CCTV footage. He even questioned the information received by cops about the alleged robbery bid. Curiously, that Sharma was inebriated while entering the bank proved helpful to him during the proceedings as his lawyer argued that his intention to rob the bank could be doubted. He also submitted that Sharma was carrying only a gun-shaped cigarette lighter.
 
 After hearing arguments, the court ordered Sharma to be released on bail on furnishing two sureties of Rs 25,000 in the case of attempt to robbery, and Rs 15,000 in the prohibition case. After Sharma was overpowered by bank staff, he told the staff and police that he had pulled off the stunt to check whether the bank was ready for resistance if real robbers ever dropped by.
