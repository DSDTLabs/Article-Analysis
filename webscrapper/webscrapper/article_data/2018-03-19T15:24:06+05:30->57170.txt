 breathed her last in Dubai when   Kapoor was in Mumbai shooting for her launchpad,  . In a few weeks, the gutsy daughter again joined the sets of the film in Mumbai. And now, she and coactor   will soon be travelling to Kolkata for an important chapter of the shoot. Kharaj Mukherjee, who plays a key role in the film, will join the duo on March 22.

 Dhadak, directed by Shashank Khaitan, is the official remake of Marathi blockbuster Sairat and not only made it to the ₹100-crore club, but also ran for 100 days in theatres in Maharashtra. While Janhvi will debut with this film, Ishaan first forayed into cinema with Majid Majidi’s Beyond the Clouds. The movie’s premise is caste difference and honour killing and even though the original movie was shot completely in the south, Dhadak’s storyline has been tweaked around for the national audience.
 
 
  
 
 
 Kharaj, one of the busiest actors in Tollywood, however, is no alien to Bollywood. He was part of Kahaani, Kahaani 2:   and also shot for Bhaiyyaji Superhitt last year. In this film, he plays a landlord. Said a source from the unit, “Kharaj essays the role of a landlord, who rents out a room to Janhvi and Ishaan’s characters when they come to stay in Kolkata. The landlady is played by Subhavi, a popular face on national television; she played negative roles in   and Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii.”
 
 The landlord is expected to provide some comic relief in the otherwise sombre drama. The source added that the unit will be in the city to shoot the exteriors. “They will capture the Hooghly Bridge, Howrah Station, Maidan and other places, including the façade of the landlord’s house. But the interiors will be recreated in Mumbai, where the shoot will resume in April,” said the source. Kharaj, on his part, said, “I will shoot in both Kolkata and Mumbai, but can’t reveal the details of my character.”
