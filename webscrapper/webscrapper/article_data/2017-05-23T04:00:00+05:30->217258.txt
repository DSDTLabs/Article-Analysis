Chennai: Micro-finance institutions, which largely cater to lower-income and below-poverty-line (BPL) families, saw a sharp drop in loan repayments in the third-quarter of 2016-17 due to demonetisation. 

 MFIs, which normally have NPA ratios below 1%, saw their non-performing loans shoot up. “Portfolio at risk has increased to 14% from under 1% in previous quarters. This abnormal increase is due to lower recoveries post-demonetisation; the shortage of cash has had an adverse impact on income and livelihoods of lower-income households,” said MFIN Micrometer, the industry body’s annual report. 
 
 “As customer transactions in the microfinance industry are cash-intensive, demonetisation severely impacted the microfinance business in multiple ways including slowing down of growth due to non-availability of cash for a few months,” added the report
 
 “Most MFIs and small finance banks (SFBs) focus on lending 90-100% only to women clients; as their credibility, repayment rate is high. We usually have NPAs below 1%, but we saw non-payment shoot up with demonetisation,” said R Bhaskar Babu, CEO, Suryoday Small Finance Bank Ltd, in an earlier interview with TOI. However, overall the microfinance industry has grown 26% year-over-year to Rs 1.06 lakh crore in 2016-17 from Rs 84,716 crore in 2015-16. More than half (56%) of the total loans disbursed were from the top 5 states — Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Odisha and Bihar.
 
 For the full-year, MFIs disbursed 2.83 crore loans worth Rs 50,266 crore. Compared with previous financial year, this a 13% increase in terms of both number of loans disbursed and amount disbursed. Top 10 MFIs in terms of loan disbursed account for 78% of industry disbursements in full-year 2016-17.
 
 Another impact of demonetisation and the resulting slowdown in economy has been the slowdown in funding. “During full-year 2016-17, MFIs received a total of Rs 24,896 crore in debt funding from banks and other financial Institutions. This represents a marginal drop when compared to FY15-16,” said the report. A problem the report highlights is how funding is skewered and only the top-creamy layer receive most of the funding, even as smaller MFIs struggle. The report said the top 10 MFIs account for 91% of total debt funding received in full-year 2016-17.
 
 The report also highlighted a 43% drop in securitization from last year. “This year, bank funding accounted for 55% of total funding. The remainder is non-bank funding, including debt raised in market through NCDs,” said the report.
