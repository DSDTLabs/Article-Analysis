NEW DELHI: Amid protests by parents whose children are studying in   in the national capital region, the board said on Wednesday that non-compliance of its affiliation bylaws would result in strict action against the errant institutions. However, the board can't act unless it receives a formal complaint, said   officials.

 The board's rules for school fees come under its affiliation bylaws, according to which the fees should be commensurate with the facilities provided by an institution and it should normally be charged under the heads prescribed by the department of education of the respective stateUnion territory for schools of different categories.
 
 The bylaws also state that a school may even face disaffiliation if it chargescollects capitation fees or voluntary donations. Under the CBSE rules, an unaided school should consult parents through their representatives before revising fees.
 
 In October 2016, the board made it mandatory for the schools to disclose its fees, infrastructure details and other services to help parents choose the appropriate school for their children. Nearly 16,000 schools have complied with the order.
