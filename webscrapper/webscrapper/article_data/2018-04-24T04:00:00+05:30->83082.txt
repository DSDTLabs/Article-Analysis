Vadodara: A Godhra court has issued a warrant against Bijal Damor, former MLA from Randhikpur in Dahod. The warrant was issued after cheques issued by Damor for repayment of a loan bounced.

 Damor had reportedly taken a loan amounting to Rs 35lakh from Bansidhar Lease and Finance Company Pvt Ltd in Godhra in April 2016. When the company sought this amount back, Damor issued cheques amounting to Rs 36.6lakh to the company.
 
 When these cheques were presented in the bank, they were returned as the signatures on them did not match that of Damorâ€™s. A case was registered against Damor in a Godhra court under the Negotiable Instruments Act and summons were being issued against him, but he did not remain present. Eventually, a warrant was issued against him by the court.
