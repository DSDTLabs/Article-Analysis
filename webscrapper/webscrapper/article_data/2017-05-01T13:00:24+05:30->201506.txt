BHOPAL: With the state government coming out with the notification banning plastic   on May 1, the date from which government wanted to implement the ban, there is a confusion in   manufacturers’ industry. 

 Principal secretary public relations SK Mishra told TOI, “We have received the ordinance signed by the President. Now, we will issue a notification on May 1regarding the ban.”
 
 When asked about specifications of thickness of plastic bags to be banned in MP, he said, “All plastic carry bags would be banned.” But the plastic carry bag manufactures, who have no clues till April 30 about the government intentions are confused. In the absence of any government order or notification till April 30, a section of plastic carry bag manufacturers and traders are under the impression that the ban is put on hold.
 
 “I have no clues about the government orders,” said Praveen Patni, state president, Plastic Bag Manufacturers’ Association. “The loss incurred by us or number of units to be closed would be known only after I see the government notification. At the moment, confusion prevails,” he said.
 
 Patni said the ban is not the answer. We need to create an awareness among people. Referring to the government’s decision of banning the plastic bags to save cow, Patni said the cow doesn’t eat carry bag. “ It happens when people wrap leftovers in carry bags and dump them in garbage bin,” he said, adding, “It needs an awareness campaign and banning carry bags won’t solve the problem.”
 
 “There is no alternative to plastic, clothes and paper, which is why the Centre allowed business of carry bags up to 51 micron,” he said.
