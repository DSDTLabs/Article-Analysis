JAIPUR: The   (Prionailurus rubiginosus) is a species listed as ‘near threatened’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( ). There are no precise estimates of the numbers of this cat, the world’s smallest cat, found only in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. They prefer dense vegetation and rocky areas, and have suffered severe population decline because of “habitat alterations, road kills and possible hybridization with domestic cats,” report Shailaja Nayak, Sunny Shah and   in a paper in the latest issue of ‘Journal of Threatened Taxa’.

 The cat has been located in the  , which the authors note could be the northernmost confirmed record of the cat in the state. Authors photographed one cat, victim of a roadkill in June 2014 on   on the boundary of the Ramgarh-Vishdhari Wildlife Sanctuary. “We assume that the species might be using different forest patches connected with each other as “stepping stone” corridors from   through the Ramgarh-Vishdhari Wildlife Sanctuary via Bundi territorial forest to the Mukundara Hill Tiger Reserve in Kota and Kumbalgarh Sanctuary of Udaipur,” the authors note. The cat is elusive and nocturnal, and there are few studies on it. However, the authors say the cats might be surviving outside protected areas. “There is need for monitoring studies on their status and population density, ecology, connectivity and threats,” the authors say in their paper.
