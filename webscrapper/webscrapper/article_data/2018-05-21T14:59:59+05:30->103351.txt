Looks like comedian   took a dig at  's political entry at the audio launch of his film 'Ezhumin' also starring Devayani. The popular comedian is known for his tongue-in-cheek statements at events, is reported to have said that it is enough if people keep doing their jobs while some have begun to search for policies when their crores have become too much. 

  has never acted along with Kamal Haasan through his two decade career. The only time he was in a film which also had Kamal Haasan was in 2001 released 'Paarthale Paravasam' which had Kamal playing a special appearance. It was believed that Vivek would have appeared in K.S.  's 'Thenali' starring Kamal, but he backed off because his role wasn't meaty enough.
 
 It is to be mentioned that actor Vivekh made a positive comment before   announced his political entry on December 31st last year. He said, "The whole world would be happy on December 31. If Rajini sir announces his political entry on that day, everyone would be happy. His fans and people are waiting for him to enter politics since 1996. Also, everyone is expecting a change right now in politics."
 
 We wonder whom he was referring to. While the speculation of him taking a dig at Kamal Haasan started after his speech at the audio launch, he took to his social networking page to clarify that he is not into politics and didn't say those line referring to anyone in particular.
