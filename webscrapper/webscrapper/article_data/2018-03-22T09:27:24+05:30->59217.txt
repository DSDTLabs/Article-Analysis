HYDERABAD: Fed up of sweating it out in the sweltering heat as you wait for your bus? Well, soon you may be able to chill out in an air-conditioned bus shelter equipped with not just free Wi-Fi and mobile charging points but also ATM, coffee and water vending machines, separate toilets for men and women, dustbins and   cameras, if municipal administration and urban development (MA&UD) minister KT Rama Rao has his way.

 On Wednesday,   announced that 826 of 1,202 bus shelters in GHMC limits will be 'modernised'. KTR told the legislative council that 826 bus shelters have been divided into four categories based on the amenities they will provide.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 While Grade-1 bus shelters will be spread over 200ft x 30ft and will be packed with all the amenities, the bus shelter of the other three grades will be smaller in size and will have relatively fewer amenities. The Grade-1 modern bus shelters will also have scope for installing a TSRTC ticketing unit.
 
 The minister said 35 lakh people commute in RTC buses in the city every day, while 90 lakh passengers across the state use TSRTC buses.
 
 KTR said the locations of all these modern bus shelters have been identified and they will be ready in about six months. He also announced a plan to operate 10 to 20 mini buses in the Old City.
