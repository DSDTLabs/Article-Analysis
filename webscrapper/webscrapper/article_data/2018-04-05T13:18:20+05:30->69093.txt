PANAJI: The Hindu crematorium at   is likely to incorporate the use of briquettesblocks made of compressed agro-wastefor the performance of final rites. Comprising coconut shells, wood chips and shavings, crop husk and straw, sugarcane bagasse etc, briquettes are easily ignitable and could save tonnes of wood from being used for cremation instead.

 The biomass bricks, which are sourced from Karnataka, are touted to be cost-effective too. Sources said that while an average pyre consumes approximately 400kg of wood and costs around Rs 4,000, just 200kg of briquettes would be sufficient for the same purpose at a cost of Rs 1,200.
 
 “When we cremate a body, we end up wasting a huge amount of wood, further depleting green cover. We had been toying with the idea of using environmentally friendly alternatives and thus settled for briquettes. They has been recognized in the UK to be a great source of alternative fuel,” Panaji Rotary Club member Manoj Patil, said.
 
 The club subsequently made a proposal to the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) and is currently carrying out a month-long trial run of this system at the city’s Hindu crematorium. 
 
 The last rites of a tourist from Hyderabad who recently died in Goa, were performed by his family at the crematorium using briquettes.
 
 “The difference was evident. There was a 40% cost reduction and the number of briquettes used as opposed to the amount of wood was almost half,” said rotarian, Anil Sardesai.
 
 Sources said the city’s crematorium is proposed to be renovated to accommodate 14 pyres. The Rotary Club intends to incorporate the use of briquettes in the upgraded premises with permission from the CCP.
 
 Former CCP mayor   who had granted permission to the Rotary Club, said, “We had decided at the time that at least one of the pyres could be built to accommodate the briquette mechanism.”
