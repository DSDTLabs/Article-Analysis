GHAZIABAD: The   (CGRF), Meerut Division, has ruled that the pre-paid meters installed in the group housing complexes and apartments cannot be used for collection of maintenance charges. 

 This landmark ruling comes as a big relief for the residents who earlier claimed that they were getting inflated electricity bills.
 
 A resident of Savy Ville De, Pankaj Sinha, filed a complaint with the forum in Meerut in June last year saying that the   (AOA), through the pre-paid electricity meters, was sending  .
 
 “Every month, we were handed over inflated bills. A closer scrutiny revealed that the bills had hidden maintenance charges and this was in addition to the separate maintenance charge that we pay every month,” Sinha told TOI. \Sinha mentioned the residents paid monthly maintenance charges to the AOA which included security, plumbing charges and electricity charges.
 
 “It is in fact a fraud committed on unsuspecting residents all over the city by AOAs and the builders. So in June last year, I filed a complaint with CGRF. Personally, I had to pay anything in excess of Rs 500 per month and there are 750 flats in Savy Ville De Apartment out of which about 400 flats are already occupied,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, according to the CGRF ruling, AOAs and builders are not authorised to collect maintenance charges through pre-paid electricity meters. The practice of clubbing maintenance charge with electricity charge should be discontinued with immediate effect, it said.
