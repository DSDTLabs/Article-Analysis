NEW DELHI: Many on Twitter think that on the eve of his India visit, Canada's Prime Minister   and   actor   have split up.

 
 True, Aniston and a certain 'Justin' have split up. Except the 'Justin' in question is Hollywood actor  , and not   Justin Trudeau. 
 
 So, Trudeau is very much still with his wife of 13 years, Sophie Gr√©goire Trudeau. And he's coming to India today on a state visit very much still as a married man, with his wife and three children.
 
 The two 'Justins' share more than just similar names. They are the same age, they are both Canadians of French-Canadian descent, they both come from illustrious families and they both speak French. Also, they both have some serious tattoos.
 
 That's probably why people on Twitter confused the two.
 
 One person on Twitter said they didn't know Aniston was Canada's first lady.
 
  
  
 
 Another said they were convinced all these years that Aniston and the Canadian PM were husband and wife.
 
  
  
 
 The confusion isn't recent. Check out the following tweet - from 2016.
 
  
  
 
 This person hoped they aren't the only one who thought Aniston and Trudeau had broken up.
 
  
  
 
 Theroux has starred in the films Mulholland Drive, Inland Empire and Girl on a Train, among others. He's also the lead on the TV show The Leftovers. Theroux and Aniston - famous for being the character 'Rachel' on the hit TV show - 'Friends' began dating in 2011 and married in August 2015. They announced they were splitting up two days ago.
 
 Trudeau has been Canada's Prime Minister since November 2015. He is a son of a former Canadian PM Pierre Trudeau and one of the youngest PMs the country has had.
