PANAJI: Taking note of allegations of hill-cutting and tree-felling, the high court of Bombay at Goa held that the   panchayat’s work for road-widening was without legal basis and directed the sarpanch to attend the next hearing.

 A Socorro resident, Philomena Costa Frias had filed the petition related to the hill-cutting on narrow tunnelled road stretch at Carrem, Socorro.
 
 “We fail to understand as to how the village panchayat, on its own, without any permission from the PWD can carry out the work of hill-cutting, cutting of trees and widening of road,” the division bench comprising Justices N M Jamdar and Prithviraj K Chavan noted in an order.
 
 Advocate general ( )   informed the court that the public works department (PWD) had not carried out the work. 
 
 He said that Socorro panchayat had issued a communication on January 31, 2018 to the town planner’s office about the work.
 
 A copy of sarpanch Sandeep Vazarkar’s letter, stating that PWD was undertaking the work in public interest, was shown to the judges.
 
 The bench directed issuance of a notice returnable on April 18, 2018, to the sarpanch, stating that his absence may invite coercive action to secure his presence. The sarpanch had told the media that all requisite approvals for the work had been obtained and only a few activists were opposing it. 
 
 “It appears that substantial damage has already been done in this matter. Before any further damage is done, necessary steps will have to be taken,” the court said. The AG told the court that TCP had taken cognizance of it, to which the judges sought more details of the measures at the site.
