AMRITSAR: A day after the Election Commission announced that the   bypoll would be held on February 4, local leaders of Congress and BJP held separate meetings to zero in on probable candidates.

 Both parties adopted a similar strategy by inviting only a handful of leaders for the meetings, away from the media glare. Sources in the Congress said discussions included the names of former BJP leader Dr Navjot Kaur Sidhu, who recently shifted to Congress, and few other party leaders, including former MLAs.
 
 In the BJP’s meeting, names of the party’s former state vice-president  , senior leader Luxmi Kanta Chawla, former state unit chief Kamal Sharma, and secretary Tarun Chugh came up. Chugh is also a ticket aspirant for the Amritsar Central assembly seat.
 
  president   said there was a possibility that the party could pick former MLA Sawinder Singh Kathunangal for the bypoll. “He is one among other Congress leaders who have shown interest to contest the byelection,” he said.
 
 Sources in the Congress said the possibility of fielding Navjot Kaur Sidhu could trigger a rebellion in the party. “Such a thing would jeopardize both their election campaigns,” the source said.
 
 BJP’s Amritsar unit president Rajesh Huny said the party’s parliamentary board would decide on the name of candidate. He added that Union finance minister Arun Jaitley, who had contested against Punjab Congress chief Capt Amarinder Singh from the seat in the 2014 general elections, would be arriving in Amritsar for the party’s ‘Vijay Sankalp Rath Yatra.’
 
 Dr Sidhu couldn’t be contacted for comment. Sources in the BJP told TOI that since Chhina had lost the 2007 assembly elections from Amritsar West constituency, and Chawla and Sharma didn’t enjoy much acceptability among the rank and file of the party, they might not be the first choice of the party. They said the party was contemplating over fielding a celebrity from Amritsar.
