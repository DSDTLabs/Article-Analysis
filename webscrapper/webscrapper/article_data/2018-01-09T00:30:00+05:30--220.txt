Bengaluru: The BJP said it will scrap the Comprehensive Development Plan 2031 and come out with a people-friendly scheme apt for Bengaluru, if the party is voted to power in the upcoming elections.

 BJP general secretary Arvind Limbavali demanded reconsideration of the plan, claimed it is meant to be a “money-making exercise” for the Congress government. 
 
 Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Limbavali said CDP 2031 has categorized zone A, B and C without proper planning by the authority. He said zone A has extensively been classified from the area between Central Business District and Outer Ring Road, thus making it a large area with huge money-making possibilities.
 
 “In the name of environmental protection, good transport system, people’s development and reformed administration, the government is taking away lands from farmers to help the real-estate lobby,” said Limbavali. The BJP quoted the example in Bannerghatta Road, wherein it is claimed by the party that there are vast tracts of agricultural and forest land.
