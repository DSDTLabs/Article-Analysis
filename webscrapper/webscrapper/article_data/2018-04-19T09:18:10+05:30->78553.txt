INDORE: Dodging cash crunch, Indoreans lift market sales by over 20 per cent this Akshaya Tritiya led by garments and automobiles while gold lagged behind due to high prices. 

 Unlike ordinary days, Indoreans flooded the traditional markets of Indore such as Rajwada, cloth market and Sitlamata market since morning to grab the best deals on the auspicious occasion. 
  
  
 Business experts said, market was up mood for the past two days as last year sentiments were down due to implementation of GST and ambiguity on gold purchase rules such as producing pan card for purchase of above Rs 2 lakh and others. 
 
 Most of the purchases were recorded in the garment markets due to ongoing weddings while automobile segment also saw encouraging sales in the city, industry experts said. 
 
 Gold demand remained tepid in the traditional Sarafa market due to absence of rural buying but showrooms and branded jewellery stores witnessed encouraging walk-ins and purchases.
