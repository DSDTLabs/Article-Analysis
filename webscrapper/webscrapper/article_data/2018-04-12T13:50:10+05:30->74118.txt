PUNE: Social crusader Anna Hazare on Wednesday criticised the political parties for observing fasts for one-upmanship and said it was a misuse of the sacred tool given by Mahatma Gandhi.

 He made the observation reacting to the one-day fast of the   leaders on Monday to protest against the Union government’s failure to maintain social harmony and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s token fast scheduled on Thursday to condemn the recent washout of the Parliament session.
 
 In a statement issued from Ralegan Siddhi, Hazare said Gandhi gave the tool of observing fast for a non-violent protest. 
 
 “The person undertaking a fast must have an unblemished character and his motive has to be pure. Today, I see politicians undertaking fasts for political one-upmanship, which is wrong,” the Gandhian said.
 
 Hazare said fasting was a way of conducting Satyagraha and one must have the moral strength to observe it. “The kinds of fasts I see today show disrespect to the Gandhian philosophy,” he said.
 
 Hazare also expressed deep distress over the increasing criminalization of politics in Ahmednagar. In a reference to the murders of two Shiv Sena leaders Sanjay Kotkar and Vasant Thube in  , for which NCP MLA   and three others have been arrested, Hazare said the crime had brought disrepute to Ahmednagar, which houses the sacred samadhi of SAI Baba.
 
 BJP MLA Shivajirao Kardile was also arrested for ransacking the superintendent of police’s office and forcibly taking away Jagtap, his son-in-law.
 
 Hazare said that crime had been increasing in Ahmednagar in the recent times and one must find the reasons for it. He said, “People are forgetting the values because of the use of money power to gain political power.”
