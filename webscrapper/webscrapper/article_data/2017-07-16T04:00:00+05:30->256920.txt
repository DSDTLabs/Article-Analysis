Ahmedabad: A   chased a group of   who had snatched a   from her bag on Friday evening. While two of the robbers were caught on the spot, another was later apprehended by Madhavpura police, and the tablet was recovered.

 Mohsinbano Shaikh, a resident of Asarva, works as an executive with a mobile service provider in Shahibaug near Swaminarayan temple. On Friday, she was returning home from work at 7 pm. At 7.15 pm, she was in a traffic jam at Namaste Circle when a man approached her and pushed her. As she fell with her scooter, two men — on the pretext of helping her — opened her bag to   her tablet.
 
 “She chased the trio amid traffic leaving her scooter behind,” said an official. “The trio hailed an auto and was about to flee when Shaikh held the auto firmly. The passers-by gathered around the vehicle and caught two of the gang.”
 
 The two nabbed from the spot were identified as Vicky Dantani, 19, and Haresh Dantani, 24, both residents of Indiranagar, Shahpur.
