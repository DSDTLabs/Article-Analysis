NEW  : For 14-year-old Mohammad Abbas, life would never be the same. His parents and siblings were crushed to death while he was waiting for them at home. He didn’t go with them as he was unwell. He has been inconsolable since. 

 When the bodies were being pulled out, Abbas’ mother Anjum Fatima was found clutching onto her children tightly during the last moments. Apart from his mother, Abbas lost his father Qumar Abbas Zaidi, brother Azhar Abbas and sister  . Their driver Mehrazuddin died too. 
 
 Abbas was excited about his cousin returning home after two years. “The entire family was extremely happy and so many preparations were in place since my daughter-in-law from Iran was coming back after a long time. In fact, the children were not supposed to go to receive her. It was only because they insisted on meeting their aunt and seeing the airport that their parents gave in. Otherwise, at least the kids would have been alive,” said Qaisar Abbas Zaidi, Abbas’ grandpa. 
 
 Mehrazuddin’s family was in grief too. He wasn’t supposed to drive down to Delhi, but decided to go when he couldn’t find a driver. While leaving home at 9.30pm, he had told his children that he would be back by 4am, as they had to attend a family function next morning. 
 
 “He was the sole earning member of our family. Our lives would never be whole again,” said Shanno, Mehrazuddin’s sister. 
 
 His eldest son, Mehtab (14), said his father was closer to him than anyone else. “I was asleep when he left home and will always regret that I was not able to see my father the very last time,” said Mehrat.
