Panaji: Historical landmarks are often overlooked as years go by on in a fast-paced society, but social media often serves to draw attention to nuggets of history. A post on Facebook reminded readers about Panaji completing 174 years as Goa’s capital city. 

 A series of epidemics of malaria and cholera plagued then capital Old Goa, due to sanitation and other issues in the 17th century, forcing the Portuguese administration to shift base to Ribandar and Panaji. 
 
 The neighbouring villages, especially Carambolim, were also affected by the epidemics and the local population relocated to other parts of Goa.
 
 The viceroy moved to Panaji in 1759. But Old Goa, with only a straggling population living in it, continued to be the capital. 
 
 Nova Goa, as Panaji was then called, became the fourth capital among the better known ones of this territory. Chandrapur (Chandor), Gopakpattan (comprising Agasaim and Goa Velha) and Old Goa were the former capitals in the state’s hoary past. 
 
 Historian Vasco Pinho says Panaji was already functioning as the capital of Goa and was only elevated from a town to the status of a city, following a promulgation on March 22, 1843, by Dona Maria. 
 
 Former state librarian Maria de Lourdes Bravo da Costa Rodrigues, says the city was one that was planned along the lines of Lisbon Baixa with parallels and perpendiculars to the River Mandovi.
