 Rampur: Police have registered an FIR against a person, claiming to be one Nabeel Ahmad of Jammu and Kashmir, for allegedly hacking the website of Rampur Nagar Palika and uploading anti-national slogans on it. On the complaint of the civic body’s executive officer, police have registered an FIR under section 66 B of the IT Act and sought help from the surveillance and cyber cell teams to track the hacker. According to officials, the hack was first noticed by municipal authorities when they opened the website to upload municipal tenders.    Ashwani Tripati, nagar palika employee who handles the website, said, “The message was being flashed each time we visited the website, unlike floating advertisements, and the entire home page was blocked.”    Executive officer (in-charge), Durga Prasad, said, “The unidentified hacker, who claimed to be one Nabeel Ahmad from Kashmir, wrote slogans in support of freedom for Kashmir, and other messages regarding people from that state and from a certain community. The message ended with the remark: ‘I am a Kashmiri, is it a crime? I am proudly committing a crime’.”    Officials then informed the company at Noida which had developed the website.    “The site was developed two years ago and experts from the company cleared it in hours. No harm was done to the website or to any data attached to it by the hacker,” said Prasad.      “After this incident, all government departments have been instructed to check their websites regularly. After consulting with IT experts, officials should follow security measures,” Rampur district magistrate Shiv Sahay Awasthi told TOI.
