He claims everyone is more handsome than him. But we beg to differ. Ensuring he’s ahead of the curve, playing by his own rules and floating in his own orbit,   has emerged as quite a game-changer. This year, he’s all set to play a pivotal role opposite   in Pari. No wonder, he bagged the top spot in the   Most Desirable Men 2017 poll after getting an overwhelming number of votes online along with our votes. We speak to him on the win. Excerpts:

 
 
 I don’t really know what to say! It feels great. I always thought I appeal to, if at all, the elite, thinking lot! But I guess it goes a little beyond that, no? On a serious note, it feels very good! To tell you honestly, I am actually blushing a little!

 (Laughs) I look at the mirror quite a few times in a day. I wouldn’t want to lie about this! I don’t consider myself particularly good looking, so how I look needs a bit of work.
 
 
 
 Penelope Cruz tops the list for me, followed by   and  . I also find Millie Bobbie Brown desirable. I think, had she been a tad older, she would have been super desirable in a cute way. Choosing one from the home ground will be calling for disaster! I like everyone in their own ways. From Bollywood, I find   very desirable. Again, I have to say I’m fascinated with a lot of others for various reasons but desirabilitywise, it’s Priyanka!
 
 
 
 What attract me in a woman are her fragrance and ability to converse, which is all about awareness about the past and the present.
 
 
 
 Everyone is more handsome than me in my opinion.
 
 
 
 I think, being myself is what gets me adulation. It’s important to be a tad old-world chivalrous to women, which I guess I am in my own way — you know, just being sensitive and caring.
