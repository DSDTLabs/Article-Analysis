GUWAHATI: The Post Graduate Students' Union - the elected students' union of   (GU) - has criticized the university authorities for not standing by their decision to conduct entrance tests for admission to postgraduate (PG) courses. 

 The Gauhati high court had last week stayed GU's decision to conduct entrance test for admission to PG courses from the 2017-18 session. Following the court's order, the GU authorities decided to put the entrance tests on hold. This prompted   leaders, including president Sanjib  , to begin a hunger strike from Wednesday. The union wants the university to legally challenge the high court's decision. 
 
 "Around 20,000 aspirants have already prepared for entrance tests. What will they do now? " Talukdar said.
 
 The high court issued the order while hearing a students' plea opposing the tests on the grounds that the decision was untimely and unfair to BA degree holders from the university.
