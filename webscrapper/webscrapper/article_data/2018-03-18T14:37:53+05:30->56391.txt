LUCKNOW: Lucknow immersed in a sea of black burqas as thousands of Muslim women filled up the grounds of Lucknow's   on Sunday afternoon, in a peaceful protest against the central government's  .

 The women from various cities across the country had gathered on the call of the women wing of the   (AIMPLB) as part of several such peaceful protests and marches being taken out in the country against the claimed to be 'anti-women' triple talaq bill.
 
 The women who gathered with their children in tow held placards that read they were against interference in   and against the unconstitutional bill that would ruin families. Executive members of AIMPLB,   from Hyderabad and Mamdooha Majid from Delhi led the peaceful protest.
 
 The AIMPLB has been rejecting the central government's triple talaq bill calling it anti-women from the beginning. In December last year, an emergency meeting of the Board was called up at Lucknow's Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama after which a formal letter to the Prime Minister was also sent by the Board asking him to review the bill in consultation with AIMPLB, senior clerics and organisations working for women. 
 
 The Board had expressed its concerns for the bill criminalising instant triple talaq claiming that since the Supreme Court had made such instant triple talaq invalid, it ceased to exist and hence should not call for criminalisation. The Board had also questioned the three year jail term proposed in the bill on divorcing husband calling it a contradiction to the court's judgment of providing for wife's maintenance even when in jail. The provision of third party complaint leading to a case of instant triple talaq to be registered and non involving women's organisation in the process of the bill's formulation were also AIMPLB's contention.
