CHANDIGARH: Haryana cabinet, which met under chief minister   on Wednesday, relaxed norms to provide a government job to the brother of Army martyr, Sepoy Rajesh Kumar, who hailed from   village in Jhajjar district.

 Sepoy Rajesh was martyred during Operation Rakshak in Jammu and Kashmir on September 3, 2001, when his brother   was only 14 years old. Dinesh had requested a government job on compassionate grounds. As he is only Class XII pass, he is eligible only for a Group C post in any of the state departments. Under the policy, as only dependent son, daughter or wife who is not earning is eligible for appointment, the government treated Dinesh’s case as exceptional and offered him a clerk’s job on compassionate grounds.
