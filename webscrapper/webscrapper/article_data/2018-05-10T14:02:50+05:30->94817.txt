PANAJI: The human resource development (HRD) ministry has directed   (IITs) to prepare separate merit lists for girls from the 2018-2019 academic session to ensure that female students, on each IIT campus, is at least 14 per cent. 

 This is also set to take the number of girl students up at the two-year-old   campus at Farmagudi.
 
 Presently, only 16 out of the 176 students at IIT Goa or 8% are females.
 
 “Many girls qualify at the IITJEE, but just miss out joining an IIT. The cut-off for girls now will be relaxed and they will be chosen over boys who are slightly ahead of them in the merit list. This will bring about a balance on campus,” said IIT Goa director  . Despite being very new among the IITs, the Goa institute will also be opting to admit more girl students.
 
 As per the new directives, IIT are supposed to publish a "separate vertical" for girls after IIT authorities see the percentage of girls who have got admission through the common merit list. 
 
 So, if a specific IIT's common merit list has 6 per cent girl students, that IIT will have to come up with an extra girls-only merit list to ensure their percentage on the campus goes up to 14 per cent.
 
 The HRD ministry's directive is part of a long-term plan to increase the female representation on IIT campuses to 20 per cent of the total number of students by 2026.
