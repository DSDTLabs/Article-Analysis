The dialogue ‘Kumudha Happy’ from the movie, Idharkuthane Aasaipattai Balakumara (IAB) is a favourite of many. The duo that gave us that hit —   and   — are now joining hands for another comedy, titled Junga. According to a source, “ Vijay Sethupathi and Gokul have been wanting to do another wacky and interesting film like IAB...   will be a lot more quirkier and interesting than IAB. Fifty per cent of the movie will be shot in Europe. Sabu   will be the editor and   is scoring the music for the film that has five songs. The movie is a romcom. The makers are considering   for the heroine. The second half of the film is still being scripted, and so, shooting is expected to start in August. The title Junga is different and difficult to comprehend. The title is the suspense of the movie, so that cannot be explained at the moment,” says the source, adding, “Junga is not IAB part two. They are two very different films.”
