CALANGUTE: Former Calangute sarpanch Joseph   has alleged that the outline development plan (ODP) for Calangute is a Rs 800-crore scam.

 Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Sequeira alleged that huge sums of money for converting land are being made by Calangute MLA Michael Lobo who is chairman of the   (NGPDA) which has proposed the ODP for Calangute. 
 
 Sequeira said that when he was sarpanch of Calangute, a gram sabha of the village panchayat had adopted a resolution opposing the ODP for Calangute, following which a petition had been filed against the ODP in the high court of Bombay at Goa. 
 
 “But, when the new panchayat body was elected in June 2017, they immediately withdrew the petition. This was done for their own profit as the properties of some panchayat members have now been converted into commercial, giving them additional FAR,” Sequeira said, adding that land conversions are being done selectively to benefit supporters of the MLA, or in return for money. 
 
 “I had written to town and country planning minister   about agricultural fields being filled by outsiders and converted into settlement areas, but he has not even bothered to reply” Sequeira said.
