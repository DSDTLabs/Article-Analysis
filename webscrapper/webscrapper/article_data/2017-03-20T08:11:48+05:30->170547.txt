DEHRADUN: New chief minister   may soon shift to the state CM's sprawling official residence which some of his predecessors, including previous incumbent Harish Rawat avoided allegedly because the house was seen as 'being jinxed.' 

 The belief among political circles is that the CM who stays in the bungalow, built in a distinctive 'pahari style' is not able to complete his full term. A 'vastu flaw' is attributed to be the reason behind this. Built at a whopping cost of Rs 16 crore, the official chief minister bungalow has 60 rooms and is spread over an area of 10 acres in the upscale   area of Dehradun. It has been without an occupant for almost three years now.
 
  Former CM   moved into the bungalow in 2010 but could stay there for barely a year before he was replaced by his predecessor Maj General (retd) BC Khanduri who chose not to move into the official residence for the remainder of his government's term. This first sparked rumours that the place was 'jinxed'. The belief was further fuelled when   who became CM after the Congress government was formed in 2012, moved into the official residence but was replaced within two years by Harish Rawat. The fact that Rawat preferred to stay at the state government's Bijapur guest house, using the official residence only for functions and meetings, cemented the superstition.
 
 However, sources close to the new CM told TOI that Trivendra Singh Rawat had decided to move to the sprawling bungalow. "The shift to the official bungalow will happen after it gets ready. Till that time, Rawatji would operate from Bijapur guesthouse and also his house in  ," said a close associate of the CM. When queried about the place being allegedly jinxed, he said, "The CM does not believe in such superstitions. Although he would be shifting to the bungalow, he would be living simply even while there since he has always practiced austerity."
