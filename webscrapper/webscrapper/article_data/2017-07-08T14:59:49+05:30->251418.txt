With limited old inventory, the owner, SM Rao has been forced to send many consumers back. 

 The situation is similar with most of the small traders in the city. “They are finding it difficult to cope up with the new tax system, particularly traders who are uneducated or have no knowledge of computers to file invoices and tax returns online,” Rao said.
 
 Though nearly 95% of traders have migrated to the new system even before it was implemented, some of them are still resorting to manual billing.
 
  Consumers are also avoiding using their debit or credit cards to avoid tax under GST. B Ramana Rao of Sri Venkateswara Traders said that he may have to hire an accountant to look into all the  . “Traders are just recovering from the demonetisation effect and now GST has added to their problems. 
 
 The government should have carried out proper awareness before implementing the new system,” he said.
