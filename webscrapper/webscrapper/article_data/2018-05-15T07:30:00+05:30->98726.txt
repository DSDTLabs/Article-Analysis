Gurgaon: DTCP and discom officials on Monday held a meeting with RWA members and developers to discuss ways to augment   in privately developed colonies in sectors 1-57.

 Director-general, the town and country planning, KM Pandurung, who chaired the meeting, directed the officials to expedite the process for setting up new substations to solve the problem of frequent power cuts in private colonies.
 
 “He asked DTCP to complete the verification of land to be used for installing sub-stations. For example, we have already issued the suitability report for installing a 33 kV GIS substation in Ardee City. The builder has suggested a plot but we don’t know about the ownership of the land,” said an official.
 
 Discom officials present at the meeting said around Rs 944 crore would be needed to improve power situation in the private colonies. 
 
 “The said money would be needed to install substations and transformers across the city. Builders should either pay the money to discom or get the substations installed on their own,” said another official.
