ALLAHABAD: The district administration is mulling setting up a high-level panel to probe into complaints of misappropriation of funds by coaching institutes that have been asked by the social welfare department to coach economically disadvantaged students for competitive exams. 

 The department provides coaching to students of various categories to prepare them for exams conducted by   (UPPSC), Union Public Service Commission ( ) and Staff Selection Commission (SSC). 
 
 The department had sought applications in this connection from registered coaching institutes last year and seven institutes had applied. 
 
 Later, the department sanctioned money to all the institutes. As per the provision, they were to provide free-of-cost coaching to students who had registered with the department.
 
 "Though the institutes were sanctioned first two instalments in March, none of them provided certificate stating how many students they have coached and how the the money was utilised," officials said.
 
 "The aim of the scheme is to ensure that disadvantaged students are not left out due to non-availability of good quality coaching for competitive examinations. The coaching institutes had withdrawn the money but failed to submit utilisation certificates and also ignored two reminders sent to them," said  , district social welfare officer. 
 
 He added, "We have again sent a reminder and if they fail to submit the certificates by Thursday, the district magistrate will constitute a high-level committee to investigate into the matter."
