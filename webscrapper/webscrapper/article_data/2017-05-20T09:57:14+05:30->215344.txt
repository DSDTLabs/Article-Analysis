KENDRAPADA: A 50-year-old bridge over a creek at   under   of   is on the verge of collapse. But people are still forced to   in the absence of any alternative. 

 Assistant engineer (roads and buildings), Derabashi division, Arjun Kumar Sahoo said, "Plying of heavy vehicles on the bridge was banned two years ago due to its precarious condition."
 
 Despite the ban, buses, overloaded trucks and other heavy vehicles ply on the unsafe bridge. Parapet in either side of the bridge collapsed a few years back. In the absence of parapet, recently a four-wheeler fell off bridge and plunged into the creek. The 14-metre-long bridge was built in 1960s. 
 
 Pravati Rout, sarpanch of Golarahat, said the bridge could collapse any time. 
 
 Large numbers of villagers of Tilikana, Bisoka, Kaupada, Janhumula, Palei and Malikeswarpur depend on the bridge. 
 
 "This bridge has outlived its utility. It is high time officials built a new bridge over the creek," said Sailabala Palei, panchayat samiti member of Golarahat.
 
 This bridge is under heavy stress and its pillars are cracking, said Manoj Mishra of Malikeswarpur. 
 
 The assistant engineer said, "We recently decided to build a new bridge at the place. After the construction of the new bridge, the authorities will dismantle the old bridge."
