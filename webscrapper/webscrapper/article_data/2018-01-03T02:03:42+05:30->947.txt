Mumbai: The minimum   recorded in the city dipped to   degrees Celsius on the second day of 2018. It was the lowest recorded minimum temperature for the season so far.

 On December 21, 2017, the minimum temperature had dropped to 15.2 degrees Celsius after which it hovered around 15-16 degree Celsius.
 
 On Tuesday morning, the minimum temperature recorded by the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Colaba observatory was 18 degrees Celsius while the Santacruz observatory logged 14.1 degrees. 
 
 Weathermen said north- easterly winds were bringing   air from north India. Ajay Kumar of the IMD said a dip in temperatures had been forecast. “The cold air from northern parts has caused this drop. The temperatures are expected to remain around the same for the next few days,” he said.
 
 The maximum remained below the 30-degree mark which is observed when the minimum is known to dip in the city, weathermen said. 
 
 On Tuesday, the maximum temperatures recorded by the IMD Colaba observatory was 29 degrees Celsius that was 1.5 degrees below normal, the Santacruz observatory recorded a maximum temperature of 28.7 degrees Celsius which was 2.4 degrees below normal. The relative humidity recorded by the Colaba and Santacruz observatories was 70% and 59%.
 
 Last year, January 12 was the coldest winter day at 11.9 degree Celsius. Many citizens said that they felt a chill during their morning walks on Tuesday. “While I experienced a chill on Tuesday morning, during the day it was pleasant,” said Ghatkopar resident Viral Shah.
 
 According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), Mumbai recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 185 on Tuesday as opposed to 216 on Monday evening. Researchers at SAFAR have attributed the reduced pollution to higher   speeds. An AQI between 101 and 200 is considered moderate and may be a health concern only for people sensitive to air pollution.
