 They were especially unhappy with  . “Until the school rolls back the fee hike, we won’t relent,” said Yashesh Yadav, who was among the parents injured during Sunday’s lathicharge by police. “Even if it takes sit-ins outside the school every day, under no circumstances shall we concede defeat.”
 
 Yadav said a delegation of about 10 parents met ADC Vinay Pratap Singh, after Neelam Bandhari, the district education officer (DEO), Gurgaon asked them to do so.
 
 The ADC told TOI the education department has called for a meeting of all divisional commissioners, who are part of the Fee and Fund Regulatory committee, on April 5 in Chandigarh, where these issues will be discussed. “They (parents) came to me with the complaint that fees have been hiked by schools several times. The schools, on their part, said the hike is justified. I had called both parties and examined the complaints. But the formal mechanism to resolve this issue is through the regulatory committee, headed by the divisional commissioner, which is the formal statutory body set up to resolve issues of fee hike, capitation fees etc,” Singh said.
 
 Singh added he requested the school managements to consider the parents’ grievances and reduce the fee as per their own discussions. “I didn’t produce any formal order.”
 
 When TOI reached the DEO Gurgaon for comment, she said it was beyond her jurisdiction to voice an opinion on the issue. “The issue will be discussed and resolved at a higher level.”
