PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation has said it would take action against the alleged encroachment on the disputed land at   after the court gives its decision. 

 PMC got respite as the city   cancelled the name of the original land owner. Now the property card has only the name of the PMC on it. 
 
 “The dispute arose due to two names on the property card. The matter is in the court and we have informed the court about the encroachment on the plot and have urged it to give directives for its removal. 
 
 A hearing was held on Friday. The next hearing will take place on July 14. A decision against the encroachment will be taken once the final order is received,” said  , head of PMC’s estate department.
 
 As per officials of the PMC’s law department, they were planning to file a caveat.
 
 A builder, who is a close relative of a top   in the city, has allegedly put up fencing around the vacant plot. The civic administration moved the district court in May for removal of the “unauthorized fencing” on the prime piece of land in Parvati area.
 
 The office of the deputy commissioner for land and estate had taken note of the fencing around the land. Later, a group of elected members from the NCP and the Congress objected to the fencing, triggering a controversy. The issue was raised in the general body meeting.
 
 The property — referred to as plot number 490 (involving survey numbers 32, 33A, 33B, 33C and 34A-2+1 in Parvati) — has been the subject matter of a long-winding civil dispute dating back to 1979.
