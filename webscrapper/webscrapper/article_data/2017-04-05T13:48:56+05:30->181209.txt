PUNE: Pune airport has been increasing the number of   in the terminal building and aims to create seating facilities for at least 1,000 people by the year end, officials said.

 There have been quite a number of   against less number of seats for   at the airport. Pune airport director Ajay Kumar, while replying to a tweet from a passenger recently, said, “We have increased the seating capacity by 600 and another 100 are being added by June in the security hold area.”
 
 Sources told TOI that the sitting arrangements in the area located right outside the airport terminal building would also be enhanced.
 
 “The plan comes under the airport expansion project. Presently, there are practically no seating arrangements right outside the terminal building. The area has passengers waiting to enter through the departure or exit through the arrival gates and needs adequate number of seats as many passengers come early. The CISF don’t let them inside as one can enter only an hour before the flight time,” another airport official said.
 
 Jagdish Mathur, a Pune-based businessman who has to travel frequently for work, said, “While I can see a lot of developments taking place at the Pune airport, the authorities need to address the issue of paucity of seats. During peak hours, there is almost no space in the terminal building and I have had to stand many a times,” Mathur told TOI.
 
 “In airports like Delhi, there are some seats on which people can actually stretch their legs and lie down. They cannot be called recliners but are more or less the same. Such chairs can be placed in the terminal building for passengers who catch late night or early morning flights,” another official pointed out.
