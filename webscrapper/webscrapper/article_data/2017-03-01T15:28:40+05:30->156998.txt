And the industry has nothing but a whole lot of love to offer for both the films.

 Also, word has it that Tolly heartthrob Yash Dasgupta has been working rather hard to get in shape for a song in the film. In the poster, Nusrat looks beautiful as always, Yash looks handsome and Prosenjit looks fierce as a baddie! The film sees the superstar in a negative role after a long while. 
 
 One of the songs from the film was recently performed at the Filmfare award ceremony and saw Yash Dasgupta perform while Prosenjit made a stage appearance. The music of the film has been scored by Tollywood's new favourite music composer Arindom Chatterjee whose Gangster hits have ruled the charts. Tomake chai and Thik emon ebhabe have dominated everyone's heart and we cannot wait to give One's album, a listen.
