PANAJI: The Centre has identified Goa as one of the 14 Coastal Economic   along India’s coastline under the Sagarmala programme. Refining, steel and food processing industries have been shortlisted as potential sectors whose growth will be targeted in Goa, using Mormugao port as the linkage port. 

 The 14 zones have been identified as part of the National Perspective Plan of the Sagarmala programme. The idea behind developing the zones is to promote ‘development of port-proximate industrial clusters’.
 
 This will encourage port-led development and lead to reduction of logistics, cost and time for movement of EXIM and domestic cargo, minister of state for shipping Mansukh L Mandavia stated in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday. The zones are expected to enhance global competitiveness of the Indian manufacturing sector. 
 
 Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha,  , Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and   are the other states where potential for coastal   has been identified.
