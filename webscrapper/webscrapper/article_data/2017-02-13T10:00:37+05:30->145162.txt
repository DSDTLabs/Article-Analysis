CHENNAI: As AIADMK general secretary V K   resorted to emotional speeches, tears and strident allegations against ‘betrayers’, close family members worked silently behind-the-scenes to strengthen her position in AIADMK. Nephews T T V Dinakaran and Dr S Venkatesh were tasked with ensuring there is no fleeing from the Koovathur resort in the outskirts of   where at least 100 AIADMK MLAs have been housed. 

 Lok Sabha deputy speaker and closest ally M Thambidurai was sent to New Delhi to lobby for Sasikala and try for a meeting with President Pranab Mukherjee to get past the sticky Constitutional issue and help her re-install her government. With speculation rife that chief minister O Panneerselvam had BJP backing, her husband M Natarajan flexed his muscles in the capital, catching up with old Congress friends and trying to meet even AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi. But, sources say he was not too successful.
 
 Sasikala apparently has implicit trust in her nephew and former Lok Sabha MP Dinakaran. Dinakaran is always present at Sasikala’s meetings with political leaders, representatives of industries and various groups and communities. He and Dr Venkatesh are said to have masterminded the show of support of more than 100 MLAs, said sources. They are said to be helping Sasikala in ensuring that the MLAs remain loyal to her.
 
 Besides Thambidurai, staunch Jayalalithaa loyalist K A Sengottaiyan has been in constant conversation with MLAs, especially those in the western belt. He has been using his clout to convince them of long term political gains if they remained on Sasikala’s side. Highway minister Edappady K Palanisamyand Rajtya Sabha member R Vaithilingam have been doing their bit in showcasing their loyalty to Sasikala and denouncing   and supporters in a loud campaign.
