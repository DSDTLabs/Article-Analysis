RANCHI: A division bench of   directed the   of police and the home secretary to initiate proceeding against officers who are responsible for   in their areas. 

 While hearing a case (Sanjay Lakra versus the state of Jharkhand, related to chit fund companies), the bench comprising chief justice   and justice Ananda Sen observed that under various sections of CrPC, including 149 and 150, there is a provision which directs officers to take all precautions to prevent crimes in their areas. 
 
 The bench noted that these provisions were not followed by the state authorities, including the police, due to which chit fund companies tried to loot the people by installing boards and opening offices.
 
 Lawyer  , who appeared for the petitioner, informed that the court ordered all police officers to take necessary precautions to get rid of chit fund companies. "In case the officer-in-charge fails to take action, senior officers of the police department will initiate a proceeding against the officers of the local police station concerned, since the crime has been committed due to his slackness," Kumar said.
 
 The petitioner also sought for direction to the CBI, ED and IT department for a summit status report of the investigation in the case. The matter was handed over to the CBI in May 2015. The court has asked the petitioner to serve the copy to CBI, RBI, IT and SEBI.
