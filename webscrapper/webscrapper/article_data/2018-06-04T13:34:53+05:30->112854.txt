JAMSHEDPUR: The   (ABM) College, a constituent cradle of   (KU), will introduce online   facility for the Intermediate classes from this year onwards. The college on Sunday announced that it will make the digital admission system operational by the second week of June 2018. 

 A large chunk of the constituent colleges have not yet introduced online admission facility in intermediate level due to technical glitches and irregular power supply.
