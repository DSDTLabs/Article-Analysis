PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic administration has decided to open the   lanes on the Nigdi-Dapodi stretch on the   highway in   to two-wheelers from March 20 till bus operations begin.

 Civic administration officials said bus operations would begin on the 12km stretch in three months.
 
 A few days ago, city unit BJP president Laxman Jagtap had met municipal commissioner   and told him that there would be lesser traffic congestion if two-wheelers are allowed on the bus lanes. 
 
 There are dedicated bus lanes on the service roads on either side of the main highway. The highway stretch from Bhakti-Shakti chowk in Nigdi to Dapodi was widened to 61m seven years ago. The   had completed the BRTS project in 2012. 
 
 However, bus operations could not be started as citizen activists and social organisations raised apprehensions about the safety of commuters due to over a dozen merge-ins and outs on both sides of the highway on which vehicles ply.
 
 Concerns were raised about private vehicles colliding with public transport buses due to these roads.
 
 BJP office-bearers said there will be railings for two-wheelers to slow down before the merge-ins.
