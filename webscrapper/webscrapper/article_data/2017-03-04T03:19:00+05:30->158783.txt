Nagpur: After sharp criticism, the state government has reconstituted Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board by appointing five non-government members. Those who have been appointed on the board include Jayant Wadatkar, Amravati, Arun Patwardhan, Pune, Vinay Deshmukh, Mumbai, Aarti Shanware, Nagpur, and Adhikarrao Jadhav, Kolhapur. Starting February 28, when the notification was issued, the tenure of these members will be three years.

The first MSBB was constituted on January 2, 2012 under the chairmanship of Dr Erach Bharucha. Kishor Rithe, MLA Vijay Khadse, SR Yadav from Kolhapur University were the members for three years. The board tenure expired on January 2, 2015.  The board has powers to grant approval towards commercial utilization of state bio-resources.
