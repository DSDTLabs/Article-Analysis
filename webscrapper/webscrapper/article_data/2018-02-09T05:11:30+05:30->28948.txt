MUMBAI: While 236 bird species were spotted at the day-long event   held last Sunday, the organizers said they were worried that there was not a single sighting of  , quails, peafowls and the Red spurfowl and Black redstart. 

 Naturalist Sunjoy Monga said vanishing wetlands, grasslands and destruction of forested areas has possibly led to diminishing or even nil sightings of quails, peafowls and others. It has also been reported in the past how vulture numbers dropped drastically in the last two decades as a result of the birds feeding on contaminated cattle carcasses, resulting in vulture deaths. "Also, there were extremely low sightings of bird groups like larks such as the Rufous-tailed and Ashy-crowned Finch larks. Besides, Wagtails have more or less disappeared," said Monga. 
 
 On the up side, he said eight teams managed to spot over 100 species while rare birds like   and Spotted Crake were seen.
