AHMEDABAD:   (APL) has discontinued 1,250MW power supply to   (GUVNL) in a phased manner, since the last week of April. The decision was spurred by the unviability of running its power plant at Mundra on imported coal, sources in the government said.

 “Of 2,000MW power provided by APL to GUVNL under different PPAs, 1,250MW supply has been discontinued by APL,” said a source familiar with the development. “The company has also intimated the state government that operating its Mundra power plant at the tariff specified in the PPA using imported coal (from Indonesia) is increasingly becoming unviable.”
 
 Adani Power had entered a long-term PPA with GUVNL in 2007 for 1,000MW at a levelized tariff of Rs 2.35 per unit for a period of 25 years. The Adani group supplies 2,000MW power to Gujarat under PPAs signed at different times. The   last month disallowed APL and Tata Power to raise power tariffs to compensate for costlier coal imported from Indonesia. An emailed query sent to APL remained unanswered. The Gujarat government has reportedly written to the Centre expressing concern about the possible impact on power supply in the state if electricity generation is becoming unviable for power companies owing to expensive imported coal. 
 
 “Apart from APL’s 2,000 MW, Gujarat gets 1,800MW and 1,000MW power through PPAs from Tata Power and   respectively,” said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. “So, nearly 5,000MW power supply is likely to be impacted. The state has communicated its concern to the Centre.”
