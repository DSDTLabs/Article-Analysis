Vadodara: At a time when the state is facing acute water scarcity, the state government has drawn a plan for water conservation in central Gujarat for which it has also allocated funds to the tune of Rs 90 crore. Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, who was in city on Monday, said that the government will take up works like de-silting check-dams and reservoirs, deepen the ponds and lakes, clean rivers, increase the facilities of rain-water harvesting in Vadodara, Panchmahal, Dahod, Mahisagar, Anand, Chhota Udepur and Kheda. “The main canal of Narmada which has been operating at full capacity for so many years will also be cleaned and wherever needed repairs will also be undertaken,” Patel said. He added that 7,795 works that will be undertaken for water conservation will be done under public-private-partnership (PPP) model and with the help of NGOs and industries. “Companies like Gujarat Alkalies and Chemicals Limited (GACL), Gujarat State Fertilizer and Chemicals Ltd (GSFC ), Reliance, Sun Pharma, Vadodara APMC, IOCL and HPCL among other companies will be helping the government in these projects,” he said. Patel added that the state has enough water for drinking purpose even as Madhya Pradesh has received less rainfall because of which not enough water was released from Indira Sagar dam.
