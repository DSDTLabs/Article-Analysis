BENGALURU: A group of Muslim leaders from Karnataka on Tuesday demanded that the Congress party reserve at least one constituency in each district of the state for Muslim candidates.

 Banking on the sizeable 12% Muslim population in these constituencies, a group led by former MP K Rahman Khan held a meeting with the party’s central election committee members in New Delhi to convince senior leaders as to why Muslims should get a better deal this time.
 
 “The high voter turnout from Muslim strongholds could be a game-changer for Congress. We are demanding tickets from our community from those areas where our candidates are in a position to win,” said a Congress leader. They also reeled out statistics to suggest Muslim candidates can win 28 seats in the state, provided they are given a chance to contest.
 
 In 2013, about 19 Muslim aspirants were given party tickets in different constituencies and 10 had won.
 
 Dalits seek more tickets
 
 The committee interacted with select Dalit leaders from the state, who sought more tickets for Madigas. Dalit community in Karnataka is divided broadly into Holeyas, the right-wing faction, and Madigas, the left-leaning side, who have dealt with worst caste atrocities.
 
 The Congress in Karnataka is already in a fix with the left faction demanding implementation of Justice AJ Sadashiva Commission report, which recommended internal reservation for Madigas within the SC quota.
 
 At the meeting, Dalit leaders also expressed fears that the JD(S) tie-up with Mayawati’s BSP will cause a dent in Congress’ Dalit vote bank in the upcoming polls. “This time, it will be a real challenge for the party leadership to keep all factions within the Dalit community happy,’’ admitted a senior Congress leader.
