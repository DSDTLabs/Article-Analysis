KOLHAPUR: The civic body has stopped salary increments of over 35 employees of its sanitation department for failing to address concerns of corporators and for frequently abstaining from routine work.

 The decision was taken after corporators made several complaints in the coordination committee meeting held on Saturday which was chaired by mayor  . The mayor decided to convene meetings of corporators, locals and officials each month where the concerns of each ward are raised and addressed on the spot. 
 
 The decision to convene the meetings was taken after several arguments between the officials and the corporators.
 
 Polluted water, untimely garbage collection, irregular fogging and lack of sanitation facilities were some of the complaints that corporators and locals raised in the first meeting. Responding to such complaints, municipal commissioner P Siva Sankar, said, “We have stayed salary increments of over 35 employees. We have initiated action to terminate those employees abstaining from work for long periods of time.”
 
 Citizens had also complained about the delay in the work to construct a road along Rankala Lake. Sankar said that the work is in the last phase of completion. Responding to other complaints, Sankar said, “Road construction work under Nagarotthan Abhiyan has been initiated. Repair work on the leakage along   is about to be completed and after this is done, the road will be rebuilt. The road construction work along Phulewadi to P N Patil Garage is currently underway. The roads damaged for the direct pipeline project will be rebuilt before the monsoon’s arrival.”
 
 Another decision taken at the meeting was to allot the work of maintaining cleanliness in vegetable market to Ekati — a city-based organisation working for rag picker women. 
 
 On complaints on the delays in infrastructure work, Sankar said that estimates for each work and publishing of tenders will be completed within a month.
