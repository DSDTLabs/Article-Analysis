NEW DELHI: The   were more dissatisfied with the performance of the   and the  , registering   on   in 2016 — 27% more than in 2015. The Praja Foundation, a private organisation that tracks accountability in governance, said that there was a gulf between the number of complaints registered by citizens and the occasions they were discussed in the state assembly or the municipal corporations.

 The report released by Praja on Thursday also pointed out in its report that as many as 10 MLAs and 32 councillors did not raise even a single issue related to civic services in their respective Houses in 2016. While pollution, sewerage and water supply come under Delhi government, the municipal corporations are responsible for civic issues such as municipal solid waste, roads and public toilets.
 
 Complaints related to sewerage and water supply increased 37% and 51%, respectively, between 2015 and 2016. And while the complaints registered by citizen on mosquito nuisance and fogging went up 10%, the municipal councillors themselves showed only a 4% increase in their queries in 2016. The MLAs raised the issue just once in the assembly in 2016, when it hadn’t been mentioned at all in 2015.
 
 Similarly, though complaints about removal of dead animals spiralled 27% in 2016 from 2014, the councillors discussed the subject just five times between 2014 and 2016. None of the legislators had questions about this subject at all.
 
 Perhaps, one of the reasons why these issues were not discussed more was because the representatives were not present in their Houses. The report said that the average attendance of councillors in all the three corporations in 2016 was only 61%, while MLAs had a better attendance of 88%. 
 
 However, the report added, “Though the average attendance for MLAs is more than that of the councillors, their average attendance has come down from 93% to 88% from 2015 to 2016.”
 
 Elaborating, the report stated, “The highest number of issues, i.e. 3,280, was raised by councillors of Civil Line zone, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, in all the three years (2014, 2015 and 2016). 
 
 “For MLAs, the highest number of issues was raised in Shahdara North Zone, East Delhi Municipal Corporation, i.e. 71 in 2015 and 68 in 2016. However, the number of issues raised by councillors of Shahdara South Zone, East Delhi Municipal Corporation, decreased by 84% between 2015 and 2016.”
