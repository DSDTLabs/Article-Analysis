PANAJI: In a bid to crack down on illegal plant nurseries, the   is in the process of amending rules of the Goa Fruit and Ornamental   (Regulation) Act, 1998. This move comes in the wake of the increasing number of plant nurseries that are reportedly running their business without a licence.

 “Goa is the only state in the country to have such an Act for fruit and ornamental plants. We need to find out how many people are running legal businesses and also check if licences have lapsed,” agriculture director Nelson Figueiredo said.
 
 The department had earlier issued a public notice making it mandatory for vendors to install a board with details of the licence, by mid-February. 
 
 There are 100 plant nurseries in Goa that have been issued licences over the past 20 years, since the Act was implemented in 1997. However, the department does not have a separate enforcement team, which has burdened the zonal agricultural officers (ZAO) to conduct inspections. The ZAOs do not have the power to compound the offence since there is no provision in the Act, which imposes a penalty on the vendor for running the nursery without a licence, sources at the department said. 
 
 “The Act stresses mainly on fruit nurseries, but trading line for ornamental plant nurseries is not a concept laid down in the Act yet, which is why such loopholes exist. It is therefore felt that the Act is revisited and the rules are amended,” an agriculture official said.
 
 A draft amendment has been prepared by the department which includes penalties, protection of officers and stringent rules on the application deadline of the licence. All nurseries will also have to produce the principal certificate of the source of their plants.
