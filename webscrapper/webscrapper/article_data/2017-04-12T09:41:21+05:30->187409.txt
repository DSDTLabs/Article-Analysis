PATIALA: Missing from the political scene since he lost his first ever electoral battle in the 2017   polls as   (SAD) candidate, former Army chief   said it was up to the   to decide his role in the party. He claimed he had been frequently visiting Patiala despite losing the elections.

 Gen J J Singh, the first Sikh officer to become the Army chief, had fought the 1971 India-Pakistan war. He said he had not yet made up his mind if he would continue to work for the people of Patiala from where he had contested the elections. “It is for the party to decide as to what role I have to play. I do not interfere in the party’s decisions. I do visit Patiala frequently,” he said.
