Mumbai: More than a week after he quit the  , former chief minister Narayan Rane on Sunday floated his own party. Though he did not spell out his future plan, his pro-Narendra Modi and Devendra Fadnavis stance indicated which way he may be headed.

 In his interaction with the media, Rane was noncommittal on his legislator son Nitesh or his aide Kalidas Kolambkar joining his party. 
 
 Rane came down heavily on Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and MNS president Raj Thackeray. “They lack political understanding. Uddhav needs self-introspection and Raj’s party has been kept alive by TV channels,” he said.
 
 Uddhav and Raj have been critical of the policies of the   government at the Centre. While Uddhav is an ally of the governments at the Centre and state, Raj’s party has been trounced in the state polls. 
 
 “At a juncture when it is essential to respect the Prime Minister, Uddhav and Raj criticized him despite the fact that their basic knowledge on key policy decisions taken by the NDA government is poor. Uddhav must concentrate on the huge corruption in the BMC controlled by the  . The BMC has failed on all fronts. Uddhav and Raj are issuing hollow threats,” he said. Rane quit the Congress on September 21 after Maharashtra Congress chief Ashok Chavan dissolved all district-level committees in the former’s home town Sindhudurg.
 
 Following his son Nilesh’s rout in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, followed by his defeats from Kudal and in a by-election from Bandra, Rane had made up his mind to quit the Congress. He claimed that he had an offer from Shiv Sena, but he rejected it due to his differences with Uddhav. Rane met BJP chief Amit Shah in Ahmedabad. Fadnavis and state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve visited Rane’s home separately during Ganeshotsav. 
 
  “Since Rane has set up his own party, he will support the government and he will be inducted in the cabinet and allotted the revenue portfolio,” said a BJP minister.
