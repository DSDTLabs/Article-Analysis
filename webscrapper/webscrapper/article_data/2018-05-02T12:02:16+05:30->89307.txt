HYDERABAD: A two judge bench of the High Court comprising acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice K Vijaya Lakshmi on Tuesday ordered notice to MP Gutha Sukender Reddy in a plea challenging his appointment as chairperson of the Telangana Rashtra Rythu Samanvaya Samithi. 

 The bench was dealing with a PIL filed by  , advocate and BJP Kisan Morcha President. It questioned why Gutha is still holding the post of a MP as he has become ineligible after being appointed as the chairman of the Rythu Samithi which is an office of profit. The assumption of this office would render him ineligible to remain as MP, B Rachna Reddy, counsel for the petitioner, said. The case will be heard again after the summer vacation.
