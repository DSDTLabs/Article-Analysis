VADODARA: A major   at the Ambedkar Circle in the posh   when residents there confronted Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials who had come there to raze structures. They even entered into a   one of them. 

 A woman also chased the municipal commissioner’s car when he was leaving the place after supervising the work.
 
 According to VMC officials, the six houses belonging to six brothers were located on government land near the circle. The VMC had recently been given possession of the 1,350 square meters land by the district collectorate. The civic body had earlier razed shops that were located in front of these houses.
 
 VMC officials said that the dwelling were initially issued notices as they were illegal constructions. When the VMC was given possession of the land to manage it, the VMC issued fresh notices to the residents there to vacate the land.
 
 “The residents were even given option of houses in various schemes at different locations in the city. They were reluctant to move to a housing scheme for the urban poor and hence were offered lower or middle income group houses for which special arrangements were to be made to accommodate them,” said VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao.
 
 Rao said that despite several offers by VMC, the residents remained adamant and were issued notices to vacate the properties. 
 
 The VMC plans to develop the space as a Smart City square with greenery and plantation. On Saturday forenoon, when the razing drive was on, the residents entered into a scuffle with VMC officials. 
 
 They even threatened them of dire consequences. Amidst the ruckus, the drive was completed and an offence was registered against those involved in creating trouble later in the day.
 
 The residents had also approached the Gujarat high court for a stay on the drive. 
 
 The court ordered that a status quo should be maintained at the site, but the houses had been razed by then.
