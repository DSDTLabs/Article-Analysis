 Coimbatore: A 32-year-old man was on Tuesday sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment (RI) for repeatedly raping his eight year-old daughter, while his wife was awarded 10 years and six months RI for not filing complaint against her husband after the child informed her about the sexual harassment.
 
 The convicted couple was identified as P Raja Sethupathi, and R Indira, 30, of Samathuvapuram at Neruperichal in Tirupur. The duo, who used to make a living out of alms, has two sons and a daughter.
 
 Raja Sethupathi was a drunkard and he had sold the house at Samathuvapuram a few years ago. Since then, they had been staying in a roadside tent at Neruperichal. He used his sons for begging. At the time of the incident, the girl was a class III student of a government school in the area.
 
 At night, police said, Raja Sethupathi used to rape his daughter repeatedly after gagging her and tying both her hands. The girl narrated everything to her mother but Indira not only did not take any action but also supported her husbandâ€™s activities.

 Child line members rescued the girl and lodged a complaint with the Tirupur North all-woman police station, who registered a case and arrested the couple. Both of them were subsequently lodged at Coimbatore Central Prison and the children were sent to a shelter home in Tirupur.
 
 The case trial was held at the Tirupur district mahila court. Special public prosecutor V Parimala pleaded the court to award maximum punishment to both Raja Sethupathi and Indira.
