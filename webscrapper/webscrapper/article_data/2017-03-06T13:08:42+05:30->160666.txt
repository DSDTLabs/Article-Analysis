THANE: Shiv Sena's   announced as mayor at   at TMC headquarters. Shinde was announced mayor unopposed as the   and NCP candidates withdrew their nominations paving way for Shinde. On the other hand, Shiv Sena's Ramakant Madhvi has also been announced as the new deputy mayor of Thane. 

 Meanwhile, the Budget session of the Maharashtra Legislature begans on Monday and is expected to be a smooth sailing affair for the Devendra Fadnavis-led government after the BJP averted a face-off with sparring ally Shiv Sena over the Mumbai Mayor's post.
 
 The BJP's decision not to contest the elections for the posts of Mayor and Deputy Mayor in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), where it won just two seats less than the Sena in the just-concluded Mumbai civic polls, is likely to ease strains in relations between the two saffron parties.
