KOLKATA: The ministry of external affairs (MEA) has decided to review the   authorities' practice to record fingerprints of infants for passport issuance, officials confirmed.Earlier, TOI had carried a report on the possibility of infants contracting communicable diseases during the process when they are travelling abroad with their parents.

 Social worker   had pointed out the danger of infections among newborns during his visit to Passport Seva Kendra (PSK) for his biometric imprints. He wrote to the minister of external affairs,  , requesting her to amend the rule so that newborns do not have to undergo the test.
 
 “The process is avoidable. Parents can sign for the infants. I requested Swaraj to revoke this particular rule that unnecessarily exposes newborns to infections,“ said Bhutoria.
 
 The minister took note of the letter and asked her officials to review the rule. The rule requires infants to be physically present at PSKs to get their biometric details and photo recorded.
 
 TOI earlier spoke to experts who had also said that biometric records of an infant is unnecessary as they are not identifiable impressions. The ridges and swirls on the finger of an infant are not clear before the age of two.“So, the biometric record of a newborn may not serve the purpose it is meant for,“ said neonatologist Suchandra Mukherjee.
 
 The amendment of the rule may al lay parents' distress. Rahul Kedia, who had to take his three-month-old baby for a fingerprint impression last year, said, “Government should follow what other countries do in this regard. While applying for visa, I signed my child's documents.“   of   was happy with MEA taking note of the issue. “Many visit India for their kids' birth. They go back after a few months with the children. But the child ordeal begins with the applications for passport,“ he said.
