GAYA: Grappling with the aftermath of a heist on Tuesday although the booty was recovered by police within hours,   ( ) officials are at a loss to explain what made them hire a virtually junked   to carry huge cash in a  .
 
  The cash amounting to Rs 25 lakh was looted when it was being carried in an old Ambassador bearing a West Bengal registration no (WB 02D 1669). Moreover, the protocol mandating information to local police about the movement of cash was also not followed.
  
  Police sources said the car was more than 15 years old and was not revalidated for road worthiness after outliving its initial 15- year life. “we are verifying the details of the car,” Gaya SSP Garima Malik said on Thursday.
  
  Asked about engaging such an old vehicle for cash transfer, PNB’s district lead manager Kamlesh Dhar said it was a matter of inquiry. He, however, denied violation of ‘cash transfer protocol’. As per guidelines, Rs 20-25 lakh can be carried without informing police, he said.
  
  Patna zone IG Naiyyer Hasnain Khan said the bank would have to justify the use of an old passenger car instead of a proper cash van to carry money. As of now, the involvement of any bank official has not come to light, but bank officials did not maintain proper discretion, said the IG.
