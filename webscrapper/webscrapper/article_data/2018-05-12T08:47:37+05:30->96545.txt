AMARAVATI:   chief minister   said on Friday that the resignations tendered by five YSR   MPs to the   speaker’s office are likely to be accepted after June 2. The opposition MPs had quit the   in protest against the   government not granting Special Category Status for Andhra Pradesh.

 Naidu made these remarks at the Telugu Desam Party general body meeting in Amaravati on Friday. The CM was also optimistic that the TDP would gain in the bye-elections that would be held after the resignations of the MPs are accepted.
 
 Naidu hit out at state   leaders for saying the TDP would not return to power in 2019. “While we are fighting for the state, some people are doing walkathon (YSR Congress chief Jaganmohan Reddy), while some want to undertake a bus yatra (Jana Sena leader Pawan Kalyan). It is the TDP that will emerge victorious,” he said.
 
 He said people had seen through the ‘BJP-YSR Congress nexus’. “The fact that Jagan isn’t criticising the BJP has been clearly noticed,” he said.
