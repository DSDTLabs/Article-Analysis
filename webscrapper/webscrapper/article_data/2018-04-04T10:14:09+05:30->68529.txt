AHMEDABAD: A   has approached   high court against the   moved against her and contended that if she is removed from the position, the purpose of the policy of reservation for women would be frustrated.

 The petitioner is Vaishaliben Patel, who got elected as sarpanch of Timbarva gram panchayat in Vadodara district in December 2016. On March 16, six panchayat members proposed a no-confidence motion against her and sent the proposal to the authorities, talati and the taluka development officer. On March 19, the authority issued notice to her to convene a meeting for the no-confidence motion.
 
 Patel has challenged the authority’s nod for convening a meeting by citing Supreme Court’s directions in Vipul Chaudhary’s case in which it has barred such action against elected office-bearer in haste. She has also raised objection to three grounds on which her removal is being sought – using abusive language, taking decisions on her own and disposal of scrap of waterworks. She has claimed that these are wrong excuses because she had been following all norms and all decisions were taken by passing resolutions in panchayat meetings.
 
 The sarpanch has alleged that it is the deputy sarpanch, who has motivated other panchayat members to dethrone her. The reason behind the motive is that she had defeated the deputy sarpanch’s wife in the election for the post of the sarpanch. She has further contended that if she is removed from the post, the deputy sarpanch will take over the decision-making process. This will result in a situation which will be in violation of women’s reservation in local bodies. tnn
