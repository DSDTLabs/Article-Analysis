NAGPUR: In an incident that again raises serious concerns about women’ safety, particularly after the outrage over the rape cases in Unnao and Kathua, a Std V student was allegedly raped on two occasions by her 45-year-old man neighbour.

 The complaint was filed by the survivors’s mother at   police station. The accused, identified as Manoj Bhise, was arrested on Sunday. According to cops, Bhise allegedly raped the minor on the terrace of his house between October 19, 2017, and April 10 and also threatened to kill her.
 
 Bhise is neighbour of survivor’s grandmother. The 10-year-old used to live with her grandmother most of the times as both her parents are working. Bhise, who has an eight-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son, is a craftsman.
 
 The survivor used to regularly visit Bhise’s house to play with his kids. One day, Bhise sent his daughter outside to bring ‘khara’ and took the minor on the terrace of his house where he allegedly raped her. Bhise also threatened the minor that he would kill her if she revealed the incident to anyone. Cops said that some months after the first incident, the accused again raped the survivor when she was playing at his home.
 
 Later, Bhise started showing obscene videos to the minor on his mobile phone. Fearing that the accused will rape her again, the survivor narrated the incident to her grandmother who informed the minor’s parents.
 
 Parents rushed to Nandanvan police station where a case of rape was registered under section 376 of Indian Penal Code and POCSO Act.
