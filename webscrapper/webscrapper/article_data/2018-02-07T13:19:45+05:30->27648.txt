NEW DELHI:   president   on Tuesday demanded the framing of a law to punish anyone who calls an   a "Pakistani", reported ANI.

 
 Owaisi, who was speaking in  , advocated a three-year jail term for anyone found guilty of the act.
 
 The AIMIM chief's comments come days after Bareilly's district magistrate (DM) questioned the "trend" to "enter Muslim localities by force, raise anti-Pakistan slogans and then create ruckus".
 
 Raghvendra Vikram Singh had put up two posts on Facebook following the communal conflict in Uttar Pradesh's  , where a youth lost his life in clashes following stone-pelting by a mob on a motorcycle rally taken out to celebrate Republic Day.
 
 The violence saw property being torched and damaged, and the arrests of at least 118 people.
 
 In one of his posts, the DM wrote: "Ajab rivaz ban gaya hai. Muslim mohallo me jabrdasti julus le jao aur Pakistan murdabad ke nare lagao. Kyon bhai, ve Pakistani hain kya? Yehi yahan Bareilly mein Khailam mein hua tha. Fir patharav hua, mukadme likhe gaye..." (A very strange trend has started of late. Take out processions by force through Muslim dominated localities and raise anti-Pakistan slogans. Why? Are these people Pakistani? The same thing had happened in Khailam village of Bareilly. Then stones were pelted, FIRs lodged).
 
 Faced with severe backlash and threats, he later deleted the post, but maintained that he stood by his remarks.
