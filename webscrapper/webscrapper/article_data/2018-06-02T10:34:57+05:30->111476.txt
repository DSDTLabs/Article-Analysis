CHENNAI: The railway stadium in   witnessed tense scenes on Friday morning after members of railway unions   (DREU) and   (SRES) got into a fracas with N Kanniah, the general secretary of   (SRMU), over access to the facility.

 
 The Southern Railway Sports Association (SRSA) had decided to levy Rs350 per month for outsiders wanting to use the stadium, from Friday. However, DREU and SRES have protested against this decision. “This rule has been brought in by   secretary   to suit Kanniah while he takes his walk in the stadium and uses the gym,” said SRES general secretary P S Suryaprakasam.
 
 Staff from SRSA, Railway Protection Force (RPF) and the police were present at the venue when DREU and SRES men entered the stadium. A couple of railway employees using the gymnasium were allegedly questioned by Kanniah who according to eye-witnesses was having a massage. “You have resigned from railways. Do you have permission. Do your bodyguards have permission,” one employee then asked Kanniah.
 
 At this juncture, DREU working president A Janakiraman entered the scene and had a verbal duel with Kanniah. 
 
 Janakiraman questioned Kanniah why he doesn’t allow other workers to use the facility while he is there. “You keep the toilets locked. Where will those using the stadium relieve themselves,” he asked. Kanniah responded the allegations were untrue.
 
 While Janakiraman confirmed the incident, Kanniah could not be reached for comment. A source close to Kanniah confirmed the fracas. In the past, he has denied allegations of stopping other railway employees from using the facility. Sinha did not respond to calls and messages from TOI.
