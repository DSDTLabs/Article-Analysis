Nagpur: The commercial department of Nagpur division of Central Railway caught   passengers unaware during a surprise ticket checking drive on Thursday morning.

 The drive was conducted at Butibori railway station. The railways netted Rs1.84 lakh during the drive. Sources said some passengers travelling in CSTM-Nagpur Vidarbha Express also protested against the railway action but officials said the protests were mostly from ticketless passengers.
 
 Vidarbha Express has no stoppage at Butibori but trains stopped during the drive giving a shock to passengers.
 
 The drive was planned by DRM Brijesh Kumar Gupta, along with senior DCM KK Mishra and other senior officials including ACM HK Behara and RPF official Sanjay Chaudhary were also present. During the drive, 24 trains were stopped at Butibori.
 
 “We registered 523 cases. Six passengers were also prosecuted and penalty worth Rs1,84,770 was recovered,” said officials.
 
 As two months have left for financial year to come to a close, such drives will be intensified basically to mop up revenue. RPF, ticket checking staff and RPF members played extremely important role in this drive.
 
 Central Railway has requested all the passengers to travel with proper ticket and also book luggage.
