MONACO: For   nothing can be more beautiful than cycling. The Swiss, born to Italian parents in Bern, is a two-time Olympic time trial gold medallist.

 
 But it pains him that the sport is clouded by doping scandals. Cancellera, who switches between Italian, Spanish, French and English languages as easily as the flick of a gear in a cycle, spoke at the recently held Laureus Awards.
 
 “I was speaking to   and other legends here and they say that cycling is so good for your body. Cycling is good at amateur level but at the pro level it is different. If you cycle to move your body, it is the best sport in the whole of planet,” feels Cancellera.
 
 “It is not nice that there is so much suspicion over every professional cyclist,” Cancellera adds.
 
 The 36-year-old says that   did the sport no favours when it was revealed that he had been doping systematically during his unprecedented seven Tour de France titles. “Lance has given a lot to the sport and damaged a lot too.”
 
 Cancellera tries to put the problem that sport faces into a broader perspective. “We are in the modern times and now the problem with doping, betting or political problem or the thing that Russia did with hidden doping...for sure it is not nice.”
 
 Cancellera, who won gold in the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics, believes in karma, the eternal circle of life. “Every society has rules but sometimes people do not follow them. I always say this: If you are a bad person, something bad is bound to happen to you.”
