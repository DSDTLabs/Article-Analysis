Pimpri Chinchwad: The outgoing standing committee chairperson of the civic body, Seema Savale, has come up with a proposal for a swimming pool near the district centre in Pradhikaran at Sector 6 after a plan for a similar facility at Indrayaninagar on public private partnership was deferred in July last year.

 The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has sent a proposal for acquisition of land from the Pimpri Chinchwad New Township Development Authority (PCNTDA). Once the PCNTDA approves the proposal, it will be discussed in the general body meeting.
 
 Last month, a total of 25 additional supplementary proposals, including the swimming pool at the district centre, were discussed. Asha Dhaigude Shendge had submitted the proposal and Usha Munde seconded it. Earlier, municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar had submitted the proposal of the swimming pool in July 2017, but the standing committee deferred it.
 
 Standing committee members Kailas Barne and Raju Misal approved a separate proposal for appointing Pranav Kadam as a swimming instructor. Kadam received medals at the national level. He also completed a year-long course as swimming instructor. He has an experience of five years.
 
 There are 12 swimming pools in the civic limits. The cost of repairs and maintenance is higher than the charges collected from users.
