WARANGAL: The   scheduled by the Congress on June 1 in Sangareddy is not just a regular public meeting, but an opportunity to strengthen the party at all levels,   Committee president   said on Sunday.

 All India   vice-president   would be the star speaker at the meeting to be held at Ambedkar Stadium in Sangareddy. The venue holds a special place for Congress as former prime minister Indira Gandhi addressed a public meeting there in December 1979 and went on to lead her party to power in the 1980 general elections. “We want each and every Congress worker and sympathiser to take the message that political tides could be turned in our favour if we work hard with dedication and commitment,” he said.
 
 Rahul Gandhi would address several issues plaguing the state as well as the “dictatorial and anti-democratic attitudes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister  . “The Congress will remind people how KCR lured elected representatives through inducements,” he said.
