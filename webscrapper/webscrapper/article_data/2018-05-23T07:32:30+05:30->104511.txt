BENGALURU: The police department has ordered a departmental inquiry to look into allegations of   (JB Nagar) police refusing to accept a complaint from a woman twice on the same day - May 9 - claiming to be busy with elections. 

 The woman, a web designer, was allegedly groped and harassed twice by different groups of people on   80 Ft Road on the night. The complainant,  , a friend of the woman, said he was more shocked with the behaviour of police than the incident itself. 
 
 "Around 2am, we came out of an eatery on 80 Ft Road when two men riding a   Dio (KA 02-JE-0462) misbehaved with my friend. When she resisted, they abused and attacked her. Sensing danger, I dialled 100. Hearing my conversation, they attacked me and sped away," he said. 
 
  A Hoysala vehicle that arrived at the spot advised   to lodge a complaint with the jurisdictional police station. "We reached JB Nagar station, where a constable said all the officers were busy with election duty and asked us to return the next morning. I tried to explain the gravity of the case to him but he refused to listen," Sunil said. 
 
 He decided to drop his friend home. "I had travelled around 1.5km from the station when another mob of 8-10 drunken men blocked us. They robbed me of Rs 4,000 and dragged my friend to an empty piece of land. She started screaming and two men on a bike approached us. Seeing them, the miscreants fled," he said.
 
 A few hours later that morning, Sunil went to JB Nagar sta tion again but the staff refused to accept the complaint. "All my attempts went in vain. On May 15, I called the police commissioner's office and explained the situation. An FIR was registered the next day," he said. 
 
  "The station house officer has been directed to appear before seniors and make a statement. We've spoken to the woman's friend," said  , additional commissioner of police (east).
