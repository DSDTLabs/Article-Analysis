 Celine Dion, who recently turned 50, has thanked fans for sending their 'wonderful'   wishes. 
 Last week, the singer had cancelled a series of shows at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and said she is suffering from an ear condition, called Patulous Eustachian tube, which requires a surgery.

 The condition causes hearing irregularities and makes it extremely difficult to sing. 
 
 Taking to Twitter, Dion said that the birthday messages had 'touched me deeply' and revealed that she celebrated the day with her family. 
  
  
 "Dear friends, I want to thank all of you for the wonderful birthday messages and videos. They touched me deeply," Dion said. 
 
 "I celebrated this day surrounded by family, while feeling the spirit of your presence. Thank you for the love and support and for being such a big part of my life for all these years. I can't wait to get back to being 100%, and to see you all again!" she added.
