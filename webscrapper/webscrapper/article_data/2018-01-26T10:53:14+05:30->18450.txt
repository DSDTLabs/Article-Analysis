TRICHY: At a time when one can count on venture capitalists, angel investors, government’s Startup India scheme and even crowd-funding platforms for building a startup, it’s a little surprising that the trend of coming up with city-based startups has not really picked up yet in  .

 B-school professors state that less awareness of the startup concept, the city’s demography as well as lack of entertainment avenues are the major stumbling blocks for students to come up with innovative business ideas. Realising this, St Joseph’s Institute of Management (JIM) on Thursday held Start Up 1.0 Mela to urge students to come up with exciting ideas. In all, 47 teams from 20 colleges in and around the city participated in the inaugural edition of the yearly event. Students of K Ramakrishnan College of Engineering, S Vikram Adityan, M Sivakumar and F   won the first prize at the mela and were awarded Rs 25,000 as cash prize. Most of the startup ideas that were pitched by the teams were for e-services, followed by organic products and healthcare. 
 
 An associate professor at JIM, P Jega Patrick, said this was the right time for students to come up with their own startups. “Cities like Madurai and   have started embracing the concept of startups, but Trichy is lagging behind. It’s because the youngsters and students are not very aware about the government’s Startup India scheme. From next year, we would also be bringing in angel investors and venture capitalists to the event so that we can create a hub for aspiring startup founders,” he told TOI. JIM, to promote startup ideas, will also have an incubation centre very soon.
