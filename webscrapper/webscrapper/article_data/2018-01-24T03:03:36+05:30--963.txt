THANE: A  , who used to repair air-conditioners, died in a   blast at a gymnasium in Thane's Vasant Vihar on Tuesday evening. 

 He sustained severe burns after the compressor of a split AC unit exploded. His three colleagues suffered minor burns. The incident took place around 6pm on the the first-floor parapet of the private fitness centre located in a commercial complex near Siddhanchal Club House.
 
 "Sageer Ansari was filling compressed gas in the AC unit while his three colleagues-Golu Choudhary (19), Aavnish Mourya (24) and Ankit Singh (20)-were on the ground floor. Prima facie, it appears that the blast took place due to high pressure of the gas that was being filled. Ansari was critically injured. The other three too sustained injuries as some parts of the compressor fell on them," said Santosh Kadam, chief of Thane Regional Disaster Management Cell. 
 
 Fire brigade officials said they got a call from locals.
