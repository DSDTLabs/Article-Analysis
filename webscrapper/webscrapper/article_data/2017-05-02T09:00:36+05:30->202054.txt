HYDERABAD: Though the Union government’s beacon ban to curb ‘VIP culture’ came into force on May 1, netas and others worked out ingenious ways to circumvent the rule on Monday. Some VIPs, to get the traffic green channel, used sirens to beat the ban on the first day. Sirens are supposed to be used only for emergencies and not for VVIP traffic movement.

 Neither Hyderabad police nor their Cyberabad counterparts took up any drive to check whether dignitaries stopped using beacons on their vehicles on Monday.
 
 Cricketers, who were in the city to play an IPL match at Uppal on Sunday, were heading to the RGI Airport in two buses and they were escorted by siren-blaring police pilot vehicles from their hotel at Begumpet to the Shamshabad airport.
 
 Similarly, motorists travelling towards Punjagutta from Khairatabad were in for a rude shock as a politician’s vehicle with siren on kept on honking.
 
 
 
 
 There seems to be difference of opinion between the Hyderabad and Cyberabad police officials over sirens.
 
 When contacted, Hyderabad joint commissioner of police (Traffic) V Ravinder said pilot vehicles of VIPs generally use siren only near junctions and not otherwise. “It amounts to noise pollution and we do not allow its extensive usage except rarely when needed. As far as crackdown on the beacon usage is concerned, the decision will be implemented,” Ravinder said on Monday.
 
 On the other hand, Cyberabad deputy commissioner of police (Traffic) AR Srinivas said they would take up a drive against usage of beacons. For his part, he said sirens cannot be used.
