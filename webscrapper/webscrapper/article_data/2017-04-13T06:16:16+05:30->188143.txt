BENGALURU: The state education department's proposal to hold a summer camp for students across government primary schools in   has not gone down well with teachers. To improve literacy and numeracy among students of classes 4, 5 and 6, the department is initiating the   programme tentatively from the third week of April.

 “The camp is aimed at providing students of primary schools with remedial measures to sort out issues in basic learning. Through these special classes, we will try to improve their foundation before they move to the next class. We will also provide them with midday meals,“ said P C  , project director, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.
 
 However, Basavaraj Gurikar, president of the Karnataka State Primary School Teachers' Association ( ), said the summer break is meant for students and teachers to take time off studies and relax. “Asking students and teachers to come to school during the summer months is not a feasible option. We have suggested the department to conduct these remedial classes in June when the weather would also be much better. One cannot dismiss the fact that many taluks are drought-hit and bringing students to schools to study is not a good idea,“ he added.
 
 The summer camp is likely to include over 7,000 schools across Karnataka, with 50 students attending from each school. “Our only aim is to improve basic literacy and numeracy of students. Marks scored by students in the public exam conducted for class 4 and 6 will also be taken into consideration while deciding the participants for the camp,“ Jaffer said.
