 Renuka Sharma, principal, DDPS, also told TOI that it was not entirely the school’s responsibility to ensure students did not carry weapons in their bags. When asked how the accused student had managed to smuggle a gun into the school premises, Sharma said, “We cannot possibly check the school bags of all students and it is for the parents to see what their children are taking with them to school.”
 
 She said the school was under CCTV surveillance.
 
 On the rusticated boy, the principal said he was studying in the school since Class IX and that he did not have a track record of violent behaviour.
 
 The father of the victim, meanwhile, said on Thursday that he and his family were receiving death threats.
 
 He said, “When my son was admitted in the hospital with the bullet injury on Wednesday a group of five men came in the afternoon and threatened my wife and son against filing a case against the accused. After my wife reported to me, I panicked and requested the hospital to discharge my son even though he had not recovered fully and took my son to another hospital,” the father said.
 
 Confirming the allegation, the medical of superintendent of  , Dr Neeraj Garg, said, “We wanted to keep the boy under observation for some time but at the insistence of his father — who said his son was not safe here because of threats from a group of men — I discharged the boy late on Wednesday night.”
 
 On their part, the police remained unaware of any death threat issued the injured boy and his kin. The victim’s father said he was turned away when he had gone to the police station with a copy of the complaint.
 
 Hemant Rai, SHO of Kavi Nagar police station, said, “The gun belonged to the accused boy’s father who is a property dealer in Masuri area. We will be sending a notice to the father.”
