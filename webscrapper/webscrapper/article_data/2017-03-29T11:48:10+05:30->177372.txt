Nidhi blackmails Ishita to take her out of Delhi else she will kill Madhavi. Ishita agrees and asks Nidhi to hide in her car. As soon as she is entering the car, Ruhi and Mihika throw red chilli powder at her. Nidhi screams in pain and then Ishita injects poison in Nidhi's body.
 
  Nidhi gets scared. Ishita tells her that she will die in 10 minutes. If she wants to stay alive, she needs to defuse the bomb from Madhavi. Scared Nidhi tells Ishita the way to defuse the bomb.
  
  Ishita cuts the wire and defuses the bomb. Nidhi asks Ishita to save her now as Madhavi is free. Ishita tells her that it was not poison and just glucose shot.
  
  
 
  
  Police comes and arrests Madhavi. Madhavi then tells how after Holi, she went to Mani's house, and Shagun saw her without make-up and found out that Trisha is Nidhi. Nidhi then pushed Shagun and she fell and started bleeding. Nidhi then ran to the parking area, found Raman's car and opened it with a pin. While driving in a hurry, she by mistake hit Vandi.
  
  Ishita hugs Madhavi, and tells her that she always knew Raman couldn't do such a thing. They all go home. Madhavi tells the whole incident to Bala and Vishwa.
  
  Bala apologises to Ishita for not trusting her and for his behaviour.
