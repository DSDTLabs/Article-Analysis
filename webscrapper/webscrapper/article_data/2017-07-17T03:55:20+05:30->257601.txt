NEW DELHI:   is likely to present a concrete action plan to   government which will include liberalisation of labour laws and changes in land acquisition act in line with Gujarat and   to help Uttar Pradesh boost its economy and transform the face of the “backward” state.

 The government think tank is optimistic about pushing the reforms as since taking over as chief minister in March after BJP’s landslide victory in the state,   has displayed an appetite for ‘politically sensitive’ big-bang reforms to get rid of the tag of ‘laggard’ attached to the state.
 
 A source said Niti Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya has discussed the key issues plaguing the state’s economy with UP chief secretary Rajive Kumar during the recent meeting of chief secretaries of all states and Union Territories organized by the government think tank. When contacted, Panagariya told TOI, “Labour reforms are important to help boost job creation and attract investment in the state.”
 
 There is a feeling that existing labour laws, mainly the Industrial Dispute Act, is acting as a roadblock in setting up of big firms in labour-intensive sectors like textiles in UP. “There is need to relax these provisions to ensure setting of big firms which will generate employment in the state where people are migrating to metros in search of jobs,” said an official.
