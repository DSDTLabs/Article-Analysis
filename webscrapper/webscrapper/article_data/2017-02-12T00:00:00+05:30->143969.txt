Around 1,000 Bengalureans, young and old, peacefully protested after the   sought objections, if any, to it’s plan to cut 112 trees on that stretch. 

 “People of the city are very anxious. During Saturday’s protest, I could see that on the opposite side of the road, there were close to 100 huge private buses parked haphazardly.
