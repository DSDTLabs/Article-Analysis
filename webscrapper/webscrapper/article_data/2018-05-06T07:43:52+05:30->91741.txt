CHENNAI: It may be another ten days before city residents start experiencing the effects of the ‘kathiri’ heat. ‘Agni Natchathiram’ the hottest season (May 4 to 28) in the Tamil calendar may have begun, but meteorologists say that solar radiation in the city will peak only in the third week of May.

 According to   former deputy director general Y E A Raj, the kathiri season as defined by Tamil calendar cannot be applied to all parts of the state at the same time. “Districts such as Kanyakumari and Coimbatore are hotter in April than May, whereas   and   are hotter in May. The temperature levels differ altogether in coastal districts like Chennai, Cuddalore and Nagapattinam where sea breeze plays a role in regulating temperature,” said Raj.
 
 Sea breeze set in as early as 11.30am over the last two days. The maximum temperature on Thursday and Friday were 34.8 degrees C and 35.2 degrees C respectively, far below the month’s average maximum temperature of 37 degrees C.
 
 “The city gets its hottest days of the year during the second half of May when the temperature may rise beyond 40 degrees C. The temperature peaks in presence of north westerly winds that bring hot land breeze from the hotter regions of the country. What we have been experiencing over the last few days are weak southerly and south westerly winds. They are easily overcome by the cooler sea breeze (easterlies) blowing into land from the sea,” Raj said.
 
 Over the last six years, the hottest day in May has always been recorded during the second half of the month. The all-time highest maximum temperature recorded in May is 45 degrees C (recorded on May 31, 2003).
 
 The maximum and minimum temperature on Sunday is likely to be around 37 degrees C and 28 degrees C.
