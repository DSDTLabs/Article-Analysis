Martyr   is hogging limelight on the small screen through the TV show 'Chandrasekhar' these days. The team of the show started the pre-production process by paying a tribute to Chandrasekhar Azad in a park named after him in Allahabad recently, where the revolutionary attained martyrdom. 
Nine-year-old  , who essays the role of the martyr's childhood told us, "The place in the park where the encounter took place helped in infusing a sense of patriotism in me. A bust of Azad has been set up at the spot and the atmosphere there is so peaceful but this peace is the result of the sacrifice of freedom fighters like Azad."
 The kid, a self-confessed fan of Azad, said that after visiting Allahabad, he actually felt the responsibility that has been entrusted on him by the makers of the show. "Apart from the story and the script that was narrated to me, I myself am reading about Azad’s life and about events associated with him," said Ayaan, adding, "I have been working on Azad’s early life by learning to play catapult. Chandrasekhar Azad used to play with the catapult and his shot used to be on target." 
 Ayaan's father, and sister actress  , who acted as   in the show of the same name, help him to prepare for the show after his school gets over. "Appi helps me with the acting part, while my father helps me with the diction and Hindi as he is from Lucknow," shares Ayaan, adding, "I feel proud to be playing a character like Chandrashekhar Azad on screen. He is a real hero."
