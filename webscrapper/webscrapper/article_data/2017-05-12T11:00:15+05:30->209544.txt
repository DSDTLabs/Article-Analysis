Ridhima begins to chant the mantra,   and Maataji join them.   begins to feel the effect of the prayer. In the middle of it all, Pari, Uma and Khushi try to stop them from bringing Piyush into the house. They call this move as dangerous. 

 Others pay no heed to their protests and Simar threatens to throw Khushi out of the house if she continued to interrupt. 
 
 With no option left, Piyush returns home in the avatar of kaal. While he is at the entrance, they all begin to argue if they should open the door to let him in. Just then Piyush breaks into the house. He shoves Simar aside and goes upstairs. 
 
  
 Elsewhere, Vikram confides in Tanvi about Anjali's changed demeanor. He shares his woes with her and blames himself for the lack of love in their relationship. Tanvi tells him it's not his fault. 
 
 Just when Piyush is about to enter the room where Ridhima is chanting, Uma hits him with a rod. Piyush looks back furiously at Pari, Uma and Khushi. He then leaves the house. Maataji and Simar get worried.
