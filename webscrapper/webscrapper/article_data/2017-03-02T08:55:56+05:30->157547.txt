PUNE: The   has suggested the state tribal department to submit a   regarding the functioning of 1,108   by March 31. 

 There are 552 government-run tribal schools and 556 aided schools in the state.
 
 With five technical committees appointed in the last four years, to check the functioning of tribal ashram schools in the state, the department is expected to come up with a detailed plan by the end of the month.The directions were given during the hearing of a PIL filed by Pune-based petitioner Ravindra Talpe.
 
 Senior officials told TOI that the department has been asked to ready the plan and explain the implementation process for tribal ashram schools. The petitioner Talpe claims that unless the suggestions are executed, there is no point in having several committees review the same issue. 
 
 In his PIL filed in 2013, Talpe had stated that there were over 900 deaths reported at these schools. Talpe said the HC had stated that the government should stop aid to ashram schools that do not fulfil the minimum criteria with immediate effect. 
 
 “There should be constant monitoring. As the petitioners’ group, we have planned to check whether the committees are doing their duties. The children in these tribal ashram schools should get justice,” said Talpe.
