PUNE: Additional sessions judge Pralhad Bhagure on Tuesday directed a   against Samasta Hindu Aghadi leader  , wanted in connection with the January 1 violence at Koregaon Bhima.

 The sessions court on January 22 had rejected Ekbote’s anticipatory bail plea and the Bombay high court on February 1 rejected his appeal against the trial court’s order. Pune rural police are since searching for him.
 
 Additional public prosecutor Vilas Pathare told TOI, “Since Ekbote’s pre-arrest bail pleas have been rejected and he has not secured any protection from the  , an application on behalf of sub-divisional police officer,  , was moved on Tuesday by district government pleader Ujjwala Pawar seeking the sessions court’s standing arrest warrant to secure Ekbote’s presence. The court heard the matter on Monday.”
 
 Pathare said, “The warrant now enables the investigating agency to take all necessary steps, including moving a plea for declaring Ekbote as a proclaimed offender if he continues to evade arrest, for securing his presence.”
