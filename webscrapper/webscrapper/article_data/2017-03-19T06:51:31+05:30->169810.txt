 The bus was intercepted at Njarakkal by   officials and seized as it was running with fake chassis number and Tamil Nadu RC book. But the MVD officials took care not to upset their sightseeing plans and took them by the same bus to Cherai beach. After allowing students to enjoy the beauty of the beach, MVD mobile enforcement squad officials arranged them another bus to Tirunelveli.
 
 The seized bus is now parked at the Munambam police station. 
 
 The MVD officials had acted on the information provided by a Kanhangad native who sold the bus to a Tamil Nadu native P Mandiram in 2016. But Mandiram gave the original owner based in Kerala only half of the promised amount. The Kanhangad native himself owes Rs 2.5 lakh to Kerala government as tax amount.
 
 Assistant MVD inspector K M Najeeb said they spotted the vehicle at Njarakkal at around 4.30pm as they were on their way from   to Cherai."The bus reached Kerala through Aryankavu check post in Kollam. We believe the driver of the vehicle is innocent as the owner gave him a fake copy of RC book. Besides the tax evasion by the old owner."
