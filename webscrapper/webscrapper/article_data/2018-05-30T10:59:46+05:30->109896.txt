 Source said the police questioned the deceased's seven female friends, including the one last scene with him on Sunday. The statements of his friends have been recorded. "Teams of Derabassi police station and crime investigation agency (CIA) were collecting CCTV footage of the cameras installed in the nearby areas," the cops said.
 
 Assistant superintendent of police (ASP)   said they had prepared a list of 20 persons, whom they would quiz in the case.
