PATNA The   (HC) has ruled that a state legislature cannot legislate against the manufacturing and export of extra-neutral alcohol (ENA), rectified spirit or any other variety of industrial-grade alcohol. 

 A special bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon, Justice   and Justice Sudhir Singh on Wednesday gave the judgement on a batch of four writ petitions filed by the owners of Bihar-based distilleries against a state government’s notification on ENA.
 
 Coming eight months after Bihar was declared a dry state in April last year, the notification of January 24 this year stated that the licences for production of ENA and other industrial-grade spirit would not be renewed after March 31.
 
 ENA is the raw material used in the production of Indian-made foreign liquor and country liquor.
 
 After the ENA manufacturers moved the HC, the state government had pleaded to the   to hear the ENA petitions along with all the prohibition-related cases pending in the apex court.
 
 However, Justice Dipak Mishra and Justice A M Khanwilkar of the Supreme Court on March 21 ordered the constitution of a special bench at the Patna high court to hear the plea of distillery owners and dispose of the matter by May 10. 
 
 “The HC special bench, functioning since April 12, has ruled that the ENA, rectified spirit or any other industrial-grade alcohol is not fit for human consumption and, therefore, the state government does not have the legislative competence for enacting a law on it,” said Bihar’s principal additional advocate general Lalit Kishore.
 
 The HC ordered the state to renew the licences of the distillery owners, Kishore said and added the state government would go in appeal against the HC’s judgement.
 
 Bihar has four distilleries producing ENA from grains. They include the   at Ara, the Globus Spirit Limited at  , the S C I India Private Limited and M J and Sons at Banka.
