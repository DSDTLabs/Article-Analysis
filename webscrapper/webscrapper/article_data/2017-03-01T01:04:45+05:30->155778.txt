New Delhi: Survival instinct often forces people to make behavioral changes in times of fear and anxiety. And the killing of engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla’s in Kansas seems to have prompted similar response from an Indian group. An association of Telangana NRIs has issued an advisory on its Facebook page asking those from the state in the US to avoid confrontation or speaking in their mother tongue in public spaces.

 The Virginia-based Telangana American Telugu Association’s (TATA) general secretary Vikram Jangam offers the following “tips”: “Do not get into argument (sic) with others at public places. Should someone be provoking you, avoid confronting (sic) and please leave the place immediately. As much as we love talking in our mother tongue, it can often be misconstrued. Please see if you can communicate in English in public places.” It further goes on to advise community members to avoid deserted areas and to call 911 in case of an emergency. TATA president-elect Mahender Reddy Musuku sees a need for greater participation by Indians in American society. “We are taking a multi-pronged approach to create awareness among Caucasians to understand our culture and peaceful nature of Indians. It can done by more participation of our community in general American society which is lacking now,” Musuku replied to TOI’s queries. He also plans to organize awareness drives both online and offline about India and Indian peoples. In the light of the current political climate, clinical psychologist Dr Avdesh Sharma sees the response as prudent as long as it does not slip into paranoia. “It’s like how we say that in an airplane, don’t even joke about bombs. In a free country, it shouldn’t be a problem. Given the present circumstances, these are things (not speaking in the mother tongue in public, not getting into confrontations etc) that one learns over time. It is prudent caution, though it shouldn’t mean living with paranoia,” says Sharma.
