NEW DELHI: The Army on Friday ordered a court of inquiry against Major   for the Srinagar hotel controversy — he was briefly detained by the police along with a Kashmiri woman and a third person following an altercation over them getting a room — even as Army chief General   said exemplary punishment would be given to the officer if he was found guilty of “any offence”.

 
 “If any officer of the   is found guilty of any offence, we take strictest possible action… If Major   has done something wrong, I assure you he will be awarded punishment at the earliest. The punishment will set an example,”   said in  .
 
 “The court of inquiry will probe the entire set of circumstances. Appropriate action will be taken after the CoI is finalised. Subsequent steps are ordered only if prima facie evidence of wrongdoing is found in the CoI,” a senior officer said.
 
 Incidentally, the CoI into the “human shield” incident is yet to be finalised.
