DEHRADUN: A 33-year-old woman from Delhi who was on a rafting trip on the Ganga in Rishikesh drowned after the raft she was on capsized. Bhagwati Barman, a resident of Laxmi Nagar who worked with a private firm in the national capital, died soon after she fell into the river when her raft took a rough turn at the Golf Course Rapids. 

 Four more people fell into the river when the raft lost balance but they were rescued by a guide accompanying them. Barman had lost consciousness by the time she was rescued. Doctors at the hospital declared her brought dead. 
 
 The raft guide, who wished to remain anonymous, told TOI, "We were navigating strong waters at the rapid when the raft toppled. I jumped into the river and brought four people out. But powerful currents dragged the woman to some distance. She was wearing a life jacket but had ingested lots of water."
 
 The guide said that a rescue team which was nearby pulled Barman out of the river but she had lost consciousness by then. Barman's body was handed over to her parents after an autopsy on Thursday.
 
 SHO Muni-ki-Reti police station Aakash Upadhyay said, "Eight people including a guide were on the raft at the time of the incident. The family has not registered any complaint."
 
 Rafting in Rishikesh draws thrill-seekers from all over the country but the sport does not come without a certain degree of risk attached to it.
 
 Last year, another tourist from Delhi, 35-year-old Subhash Kumar, had drowned when his raft capsized near Golf Course Rapids, usually negotiated only by professionals. Experts say that on a scale of one to four, the Golf Course Rapids are ranked at three (experienced paddling skills), whereas Grade I requires only basic experience and Grade IV requires white water experience.
 
 After the incident, TOI had reported that rafting norms were not being adhered to in Rishikesh, which is among the top destination for adventure sports in the country.
