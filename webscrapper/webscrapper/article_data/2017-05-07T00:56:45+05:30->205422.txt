THANE: A   surgeon from Thane has registered a case of cheating and   of Rs 5 lakhs against the head-mistress and three teachers of Captain Ravindra Madhav Oak High School, Kalyan. The accused are the headmistress Hemlata Dada Nikam, Milind Madhav Khaladkar, Sanjay Mangesh Chavan and Manisha Moreshwar Godbole.

 “The accused are government employees and require the signature of the civil   to claim   bills. Since, April 12, 2016, the quartet would often forge the 56-year-old doctor’s signature and submit fake medical bills worth Rs 5, 72,429 to the government. In addition, the accused would also produce fake medical refund claim forms along with a fake stamp claimed to be given by the doctor to convince the officials the true validity of the bogus documents” said senior police inspector, M V Dharmadhikari .
 
 The surgeon said, “When I saw the documents, I noticed a change in my signature. It was slightly different. Suspecting something fishy, I immediately informed the police and on Friday afternoon lodged a complaint with Thane Nagar police station against the accused.”
 
 The cops are on the look-out for the quartet who are booked under Section 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of a document which purports to be a valuable security), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code.
