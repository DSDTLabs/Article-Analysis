NEW DELHI: Soon, if you   the   when the   turns red on   in south Delhi, you could be   without your knowing it and the order   your home. 

 Delhi traffic police would have the country’s first operational camera-based automatic challan system. The system would reduce the work load of traffic police personnel deployed on the stretch by almost half. 
 
 An agreement was signed between Delhi Police and Maruti Suzuki on Tuesday for the project that would cover a 14-km stretch between Dhaula Kuan and Sarai Kale Khan. LG Anil Baijal said while Delhi’s population has been increasing at an annual rate of 2.5-3%, the number of vehicles has been increasing by up to 7%. Traffic management is getting more complicated as a result, Baijal said.
 
 
  
 Union minister Nitin Gadkari said his ministry plans to roll out the IT-based system across national highways. 
 
 “The IT-based traffic management system is more important since the forthcoming Motor Vehicles Act calls for more evidence-based enforcement,” said special CP (traffic) Dependra Pathak. He added that a proposal for an IT-based integrated traffic management system would be submitted to the ministry. 
 
 The Rs 15 crore project would be fully operational within a year. Under the project, police would have about eight cameras with night vision and HD recording installed at each junction to scan the specially painted stop lines. The numberplate of any vehicle that crosses the stop line after a signal turns amber or red would be automatically clicked and uploaded to a server. A challan would be automatically generated and sent by post to the car owner. 
 
 A control room would be set up in south Delhi. During the trial phase, traffic would be monitored at Ashram, Lajpat Nagar, Kotla Mubarakpur, Aurobindo Marg, Africa Avenue and Rao Tula Ram Marg crossings during peak hours.
