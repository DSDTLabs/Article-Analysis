COIMBATORE: Tamil language and culture minister K Pandiarajan said the state government will set up three onsite museums to display ancient artefacts excavated from the places of archaeological significance. He was speaking at the southern regional conference on DigiHR organised by national institute of personnel management.

  said a sum of Rs 1 crore has been allotted for the onsite museum at Keeladi and the work will commence soon. Similar onsite museums will be set up at   and Adhichanallur this year. Pandiarajan said the excavations at Keeladi have yielded more than the expected number of centuries-old articles. In the past 18 days, 2,200 articles have been collected, he said adding the excavations will continue for another six months.
 
 So far, in the all the four phases of the archaeological explorations conducted so far, more than 7,000 articles have been collected. Half of these articles are in Tamil Nadu, while the remaining are kept in Mysuru. Once the museum is established, these articles will be displayed.
 
 Speaking about the Supreme court’s decision to shift the location of the   Management Board from Karnataka to New Delhi, he said it was a victory. “We have always believed that the legal route will get us the desired results,” he said.
 
 He expressed hope that the political turmoil in Karnataka will not affect the release of Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu, this year. When asked if the state would get adequate water to facilitate release of the same from Mettur for short-term cultivation in Cauvery delta districts, Pandiarajan said, he believed so. “We are working on it,” he added.
