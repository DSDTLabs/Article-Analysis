Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court, on Thursday, ordered a status quo on allotment of loading/unloading work by   Board to two groups who were alleged referred by top city politicians, including a minister.

 The petitioner — Rashtriya Mathadi Shramik Sangh’s president Bajrangsingh Parihar — through counsel Vikram Marparkwar took strong objection on allotment of work to the Gajraj Kashyap and Surendra groups (referred as Toli among Mathadi workers).
 
 A division bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Rohit Deo issued notice to the respondents, including state department of industries, energy and labour. Chairman and secretary of Mathadi boards in Nagpur and Wardha are other respondents in the case.
 
 The petitioner informed the court that Mathadi   on November 22, 2013, issued an order that loading/unloading work of food grains except steel should be handed over to Kashyap and Surendra groups. Various meetings were held with union advisory committee headed by the guardian minister where it was clearly resolved that work of steel shouldn’t be handed over to these groups.
 
 On February 10 this year, the Mathadi Board issued new communication for handing over steel work to the groups. At that time, petitioner had filed a case in high court on which state secretary was told to file a proper affidavit.
 
 In May, respondents issued another order reiterating that loading/unloading work of steel should be handed over to same groups. Again, it was challenged by the petitioner.
 
 During pendency of both petitions, another order was issued on June 23 by the respondents with same contents, which was again challenged by the petitioner before the court.
