PUNE: Master blaster   will launch Mission Young and Fit India at Savitribai Phule Pune University on Monday.

 The university’s sports teachers and students will get to interact with Tendulkar for half-an-hour from 2pm at Chandrasekhar auditorium at Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics on the Savitribai Phule Pune University ( ) campus.
 
 Addressing a news conference here on Friday, Deepak Mane, the dean of physical education of SPPU, said the mission was aimed at creating awareness about sports not just in the students participating in sports but each student studying in the university or any of its affiliated colleges.
 
 “We are seeing an increasing lethargy among students towards sports. Earlier, summer vacations would mean playing with abandon till your parents dragged you home, but now students are hardly playing any games. This is very dangerous as we may be moving towards an unfit generation,” said SPPU registrar Arvind Shaligram, who was present at the briefing.
 
 Mane said the mission was not to popularize any particular sport but to bring students to the playground. “It is of prime importance that youngsters are involved in physical activity. It should be imbibed in the public consciousness that playing any game and exercising your body is vital for a healthy lifestyle,” said Mane
 
 Apart from a presentation on mental health, discussions would be held about how to integrate sports and academics. “The attendance is by invitation only. Around 250 people from educational institutes and sports directors have been called for the event,” said an official.
