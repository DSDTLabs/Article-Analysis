KOCHI: The Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) on Friday took back 35 cents in Elamkulam, which was given on lease to   41 years ago. The land was leased out in 1976 for a period of 30 years. The lease period ended in 2006.

 When the GCDA tried to take over the land, the   officials took the matter to court which issued orders in favour of the former. 
 
 “A garden is functioning on the 35 cents. The Lions Club owns 40 cents adjacent to GCDA land. When their lease period was over in 2006, they refused to relinquish the land. Instead they tried to stake a claim on it which resulted in court cases,” said M C Joseph, secretary, GCDA.
 
 The land falls on survey number 398/1 in   and is included in the   planning scheme of the authority. GCDA officials reached the spot on Friday and marked the boundary of land. They will fence the area on Saturday.
