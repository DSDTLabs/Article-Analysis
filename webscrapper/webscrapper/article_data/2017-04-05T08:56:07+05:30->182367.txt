HYDERABAD: In a major goof up, 24 students of a private school from the city, appearing for their Class 10 board  , lost 33 marks after the school authorities mistakenly gave them the wrong question paper.

 As it turns out, the stu dents of Vignana Jyothi Public School, Yousufguda, were given the   question paper instead of the one prepared for Telangana candidates, after the authorities registered the wrong code.
 
 Though the incident took place on March 13, it came to light only on Tuesday when parents and students gathered at the school demanding that the management `rectify' the mistake.
 
 “The school authorities re gistered the wrong code and did not even bother to check it until the day of examination.As 57 marks are common in both papers, my son could answer some questions. But he couldn't attempt rest of the questions, carrying 33 marks,“ said Poojitha, a parent.
 
 The parents also approached the local police against the school principal. “We have received a complaint and are looking into the issue. While as of now we haven't registered an FIR we might file a neg ligence case against the principal of the school,“ the SR Nagar police said.
 
 While the parents said that they learnt of the goof up a day after the exam, they remained quiet until now as the school authorities had promised to resolve the issue.
 
 When contacted, the principal,  , admitted to the goof up but said that the school had sent a representation to CBSE in the hope of getting a positive reply soon. She added that all students will at least get pass marks.
 
 “While registering, our Telugu teacher entered the wrong code. As she has more than a decade of experience I was confident that the code was right. Now that the goof up happened we consulted the board and made a representation,“ said Kumari.
