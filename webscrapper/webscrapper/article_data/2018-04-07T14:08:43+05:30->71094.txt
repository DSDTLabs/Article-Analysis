LUCKNOW: BSP supremo   lashed out at   national president Amit   on Saturday, saying that BJP was power-drunk that it was making the mistake of presuming that this is a country of foolish people.

 Referring to Shah’s statement made on Friday where he compared the opposition to “cats, dogs, snakes and mongoose”, Mayawati said that UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had used similar objectionable and insulting “Sanghi” language before the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye-elections because of which the people “whipped” BJP out of power in these two constituencies.
 
 “Despite this, BJP’s top leadership is appearing strong in its criminal mindset and Sanghi ways of functioning. However, people of this country will not overlook this. Shah’s statement also shows to what level the party has fallen under the leadership of the Guru and Shishya (Modi and Shah),” she said.
 
 Mayawati also accused BJP of using all possible means to ensure that the Budget session of the Lok Sabha was a washout this time because Modi did not want a discussion on the no-confidence motion that was moved by its former allies. “Modi and Shah are arrogant and their anti-people policies have now been revealed. It is because of this that its former allies have moved a no-confidence motion against it,” she said.
