NEW DELHI: Can recommendations made by the Justice R M   to bring accountability and transparency in cricket administration be implemented in other sports bodies as well?

 The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide on a plea by former sportspersons who sought its direction to inject a dose of reforms in the administration of other sports bodies engulfed with political influences and corruption.
 
 A bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar, Justices N V Ramana and D Y Chandrachud issues notice to the Centre,   ( ) and   ( ) seeking their response on whether the Lodha panel recommendation -barring ministers and bureaucrats from cricket administration and fixing an upper age limit of 70 years for office bearers -be also put in force for other sports federations.
 
 There are 28 petitioners -including hockey Olympian Ashok Kumar, former athlete Ashwini Nachappa, former cricketers Bishan Singh Bedi and Kirti Azad, former chess player Pravin Thipsay and shuttler Jwala Gutta -who approached the court and filed a joint petition.
 
 “There are several instances of mismanagement and corruption in various national sports federations which have caused the downfall of sporting activities. Further, instances of sexual harassment have also caused women and girls to be discouraged from participating in sporting activities. Since there are no checks and balances, the sports bodies are marred with instances of favouritism, corruption, age fraud and conflict of interest,“ the petition said.
