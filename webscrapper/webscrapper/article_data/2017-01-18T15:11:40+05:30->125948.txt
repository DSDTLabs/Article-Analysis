ABU DHABI: India is committed to meet its   goals and is not bothered about US president-elect  's skepticism on policies related to  ,  , India's minister of state with independent charge for power, coal, new and renewable energy and mines, told delegates at the 2017 Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week.

 Goyal was asked whether Trump's negative stand on global warming will influence India to change its plans of becoming a global hub for renewable energy. "India doesn't interfere in any other country's elections and we respect the fact that America has chosen its leader," Goyal said. "However, clean energy is not something that we are working on because somebody else wants us to do it. It's a matter of faith and the faith of the leadership in India. Nothing on Earth is going to stop us from doing that."
 
 Although India remains dependent on coal to fuel its energy needs, it aims to scale up its   capacity to 100GW by 2022. It is targeting 60GW from wind energy and plans to bring in hydro power, from which it generates 40GW, into the category of renewable energy. By 2022, the country plans to generate around 225GW from clean and renewable sources. When other global industry experts said renewable energy needs private funding to be successful, Goyal said he does not see any challenge in getting finance for renewable energy in India. "Gone are the days when government had to bring in subsidies. We don't need to convince the industry anymore. We just need to make sure that there are no roadblocks."
 
 The minister said the cost of renewable energy has been gradually decreasing and currently it is at par or marginally higher than what is generated from fossil fuels.
