GHAZIABAD: The district administration has recommended   of three   of UP Housing Board on Thursday for their alleged connivance in construction of buildings in violation of approved layout maps in as many as nine   in Vasundhara. The irregularities had come to light during an inspection conducted by an additional district magistrate. 

 During inspection, it came to light that numerous flats were under construction for sale in plots of land for which the housing board had approved construction of only single-dwelling units. The inspection was ordered by district magistrate Ritu Maheshwari in March after a complaint pertaining to illegal constructions was filed before divisional commissioner Prabhat Kumar by a group of senior residents of Vasundhara.
 
 The inspection was conducted by ADM (finance & revenue) Sunil Kumar Singh. All nine under-construction buildings are located in Sector 5 of Vasundhara, out of which one belongs to a retired chief engineer of the housing board.
 
 “The complaint was against 10 plots of land. However, on spot inspection conducted on March 13, we found one plot vacant. On the remaining plots, numerous flats were being constructed. The housing board had approved buildings of either three to four floors over these plots. Stilt parking had been allowed over a few plots too. However, the buildings were approved as single-dwelling units with only one kitchen each not meant for different families. During inspection, however, we found numerous flats with separate kitchens in each,” Singh told TOI.
 
 The three officials who allegedly connived with plot owners have been identified as executive engineer Rajiv Kumar, assistant engineer MB Kaushik and junior engineer Parvesh Gaur.
