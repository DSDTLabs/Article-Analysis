 Earlier this month, Hyderabad-born Nadella during an interaction with students had underlined the importance of "diversity and inclusion" amid an environment of divisiveness.
 
 Also during an employee Q&A on January 30, Nadella had addressed President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration, saying there is no place for bias or bigotry in any society.
 
 Nadella's comments come against the backdrop of a divisive and anti-immigrant rhetoric engulfing the US under the presidency of Trump.
