GURGAON: Power   DHBVN has rapped   and Company, the private firm to which the maintenance work of Gurgaon was awarded, for “no significant performance” following a TOI report on the widespread tripping after the weekend shower. 

 Heavy rain triggered massive outages across Gurgaon, plunging many parts of the city into darkness and raising doubts over the quality work carried out by the private firm.
 
 “It is pointed out that a period of more than seven months has lapsed since the issue of work orders, but no significant performance has been observed on part of your services till date, which has been viewed seriously by the management,” DHBVN’s letter reads. 
 
 The representatives of the private firm have also been called to attend a performance review meeting on December 12 in Hisar.
 
 Sandha and Company was awarded the contract on a trial basis for maintenance of all five sub-divisions in Gurgaon by DHBVN in June 2016. After months of defending its decision to award contract to the company, the discom had faced fresh criticism last week as the outages revealed poor power maintenance in Gurgaon.
