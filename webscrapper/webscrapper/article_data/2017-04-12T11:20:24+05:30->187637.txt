CHARMINAR: There seem to be a significant gap in skills in the city as 80 per cent of   are unemployable, as per Aspiring Mind Report 2016, highlighting the need for an upgraded education and training system.

 City educators say that thousands of youngsters are being trained but they do not possess necessary skill and talent. While the syllabus of other countries is said to be practical, thousands of engineers are jobless in the state due to lack of these practical skills.
 
 Engineering students say the curriculum for engineering education does not favour highprofile jobs in construction and building sector, as the academic syllabus often fail to fulfil real-world applications. â€œMany Indian engineers are not even aware of the international standards that are exercised in high-profile construction projects like the   or the   project. The education system needs to be upgraded and make it more coherent with real-world execution and not depend on International companies,''  , an engineer explained.
