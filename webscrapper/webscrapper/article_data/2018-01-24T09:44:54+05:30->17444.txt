 The two found solace in each other during their stint in the   season 9, where they became BFFs.
 
 Prince, post winning the show was always seen hanging out with his BFF Yuvika. The friendship soon culminated into love and the two are now all set to tie the knot soon. The two were inseparable and Prince, though did not admit but developed a strong liking for the lady. He finally poured his heart out recently and accepted his love for her. But Yuvika took her own sweet time to nod in acceptance to his proposal.
 
 The two got engaged on 23rd of January, this year, a date that is extremely special to Prince as he had won the BB 9 trophy on this date, two years ago. 
 
 Earlier, this year, the news of them being engaged went viral but both had denied of any such happening then.
 
 Here's congratulating the two.
