HYDERABAD: The 26th plenary of the All India Muslim Personal Board in the city was wracked by controversy over top cleric  's suggestion on shifting the Babri Masjid site, but the biggest gainer from the crisis-ridden meet was Hyderabad MP and   president  . 

 And   is drawing flak from a section of the community for allowing Owaisi to "hijack" the plenary in Hyderabad and use it to extract maximum political mileage.
 
 Owaisi who hosted the three-day convention at his family-owned auditorium near Owaisi hospital received applause from clerics both at the plenary and at the massive rally after the convention. After the Board allowed him to head the event's reception committee, many eminent Muslims from Hyderabad decided to skip the event and even criticized the Board for allowing its platform to be used by a political party and its boss. "The Board has set a bad precedent by allowing the 26th plenary to be held at the premises owned by a political leader. The Board traditionally has maintained a distance from political leaders," observed Hyderabad's leading   daily Siasat in an editorial.
 
 Editors of leading Urdu dailies in Hyderabad were initially roped in to be part of the reception committee. Most of them chose to keep away from the events once they found that Owaisi headed the reception committee. "The Board should have held its events at a neutral place, not in the premises of Asaduddin Owaisi who has ambitions of becoming the sole leader of Indian Muslims. I chose to keep away from it," said a Hyderabad-based prominent Urdu editor, requesting anonymity.
 
 That Owaisi's profile received a major boost was also evident at the massive meet on Sunday night - held at   which houses MIM's headquarters - when Shakeel Samdani, a Board member and Law professor at Aligarh Muslim University, appealed to Indian Muslims to strengthen "sher (lion) of Hyderabad" and create at least 10 more such "bravehearts" across the country.
