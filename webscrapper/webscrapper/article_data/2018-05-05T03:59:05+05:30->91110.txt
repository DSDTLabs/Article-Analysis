GURUGRAM: Muslim employees of Fidelity International, Genpact, Aricent and Evalueserve said they read namaz under “unusual” police protection in the park opposite Candor Techspace in Sector 48 on Friday as right-wing activists disrupted prayers at several places in the city.

 Several employees said that this was happening for the first time. “I have been living in Gurugram city for many years,” said Naved. “We pray at the same place every Friday but today, there was heavy police presence.”
 
 Employees told TOI that there were six cops, including a woman constable, at the park. “They were all from Sadar police station,” said Aamir. “We pray here every Friday. We pool in money so that water for compulsory ablution and mats can be arranged here. Some money is also paid to the cleric who leads the congregation.”
 
 Employees said that as soon as their prayers ended, they received texts that prayers at Unitech Cyber Park had been disrupted. “No disruption took place here but some of our friends praying near Unitech Cyber Park messaged, saying they were facing disruptions to the point that they had to abandon prayers midway,” said Aabid.
 
 Tanveer Alam, another employee, said, “Freedom of religion is a fundamental right enshrined in our Constitution. The land where we pray is Huda land. We weren’t encroaching on anyone’s space.”
 
 Naved said they were seeing a pattern in such disruptions which were increasing ahead of the polls. “I can see a link between what is currently happening in AMU, and here,” he added.
