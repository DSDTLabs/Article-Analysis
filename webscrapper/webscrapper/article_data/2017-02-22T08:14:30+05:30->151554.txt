MUMBAI: The migrant vote stood out in   with scores of settlers from   and Bihar queuing up to exercise their franchise.

 Naveen Kumar, who had come along with his family to cast a vote at Sangharsh municipal school, said, “We have had an MNS corporator who has now defected to the Shiv  . We are not happy with the Sena’s performance in the civic corporation over the past two decades. There is also resentment against BJP. So most of us will vote for other parties.”
 
 Chandivli, located between Powai and Andheri, was an industrial belt surrounded by hillocks, many of which have been flattened to make way for slum rehab schemes. Now, it is largely a mix of low- and middle-income neighbourhoods.
 
 It is touted as a Congress bastion by insiders who cite trends from the last assembly poll. But before that, MNS won in the 2012 civic elections. Sitting Congress MLA Arif Naseem Khan visited booths on Tuesday to ensure that voters could locate names on electoral rolls.
 
 “A lot of north Indians are voting against Sena and BJP because of lack of transparency as well as corruption in the civic corporation over the past two decades,” he said. “In the assembly polls, north Indians voted for us (Congress) despite the Modi wave. The winning margin was 6,000 votes, and we expect the trend to hold in our favour even now.” 
 
 BJP MP Kirit Somaiya rubbished his assessment. “Every section, caste and community in Mumbai has shown support to BJP. We are confident of getting a good percentage from every community, including the north Indians. BJP will be number one in the civic polls, and to be a numero uno, you need to have support from all quarters.”
 
 A Sena functionary said the party was instrumental in laying pipelines, widening roads, and providing civic amenities in hilly areas in Chandivli belt.
