RAJKOT: Two elderly persons were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly raping a 12-year-old girl several times over a period of eight months in the city’s   colony area. 

 The survivor, studying in class VII, was found to be six months pregnant when doctors first examined her a few days ago.
 
 The accused —   (67) and Arvind Kubavat (52) — were arrested by the Mahila Police station officers on Tuesday. They live in the same neighbourhood as the girl’s family.
 
 According to police, about eight months back,   took the girl to his house under some pretext and allegedly raped her. Kubavat too raped her. 
 
 But the little girl’s ordeal did not end there. The accused duo went on to exploit the minor for over seven months and raped her several times, said police.
 
 However, a few days ago the survivor complained of pain in the abdomen and her mother took her to the doctor. After examining the girl, the doctor told her mother that her daughter was six months pregnant.
 
 Still, the girl did not reveal the names of the accused. Only two days ago, the minor girl told her mother that the accused had raped her several times over past eight months. 
 
 Following the revelation, the survivor’s mother lodged a complaint with the   police station on Monday. The probe was handed over to the Mahila Police station on Tuesday which later in the day arrested the two accused.
