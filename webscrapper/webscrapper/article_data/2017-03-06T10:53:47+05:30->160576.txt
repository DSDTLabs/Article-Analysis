  : A three-member team of the   ( ), the apex body monitoring the quality of education and infrastructure in the institutes of higher learning in the country, would inspect facilities at the Gaya-based Gautam   on March 6 and 7. 

 The team will submit its report to the council for the award of grade based on calculations made on a four-point scale. Earlier, the assessment body awarded C grade to Magadh University. Public funding of the institutions has been directly linked with the NAAC grading and higher points mean fatter grants, said sources.
 
 The team, according to Satendra Parajapati, principal of the college, would be led by A P Tripathi, former VC of the Berhampur University, Odisha. P N Premlatha, department of historic studies and tourism management, Mother Teresa Women's University, Kodaikanal (Tamil Nadu) and Dr Juanita, retired principal, Fatima Convent School and College, Coorg (Karnataka) are the other members of the team.
 
 Gautam Buddha Mahila College, established in 1954, has been subjected to utter neglect. The college has been running from a small residential rented building with meagre facilities. Even proper toilet facility for the teachers and students does not exist. Faculty strength too leaves much to be desired. As against 49 sanctioned posts of teachers, the working strength is just 12. Altogether 37 of the 49 sanctioned teaching positions are vacant.
 
 College principal Satyendra Prajapati, however, said guest teachers have been hired to address the issue of faculty shortage. "Subjects like physics and mathematics are not taught in the college. There is no regular teacher for botany as well," said the principal.
