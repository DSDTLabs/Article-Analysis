BATHINDA: The partners of a Bathinda-based logistics firm have accused some persons of forcing them against undertaking transportation jobs in the   (HMEL) refinery near  . Gaurav Garg and his partner   have accused some persons with political patronage of forcing them to not take up any transportation job in the refinery.

 Addressing media on Monday, Gaurav and Vikas said their firm was given a contract to transport machinery, JCBs and scrap out of the refinery to other locations. “Two of trucks were loaded with machines on February 8 but some persons objected to it and told us that we could not carry out the job. They said only they would carry out the job of transportation. They snatched the documents and Rs 1.30 lakh in cash from us and threatened us with dire consequences. We approached the local police but nothing has been done so far to give us justice.”
 
 Both said they had given complaint to the Bathinda deputy commissioner (DC) and senior superitendent of police (SSP) on Monday. DC   said the complaint had been referred to the police. SSP   said, “We are looking into the matter and investigations are being conducted.”
