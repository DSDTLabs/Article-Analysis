Kannada director   has never been one to shy away from making his views on the political framework in the country known in public. His preferred medium has been versions of songs from his films, be it the ‘Election song’ in Vaastu Prakaara, ‘GST song’ in   or the recent number he wrote on the   title track that urges people to vote.

Our song gave me the freedom to use some wicked philosophy about present-day  . The lyrics are rather sarcastic and a hilarious expression of the voters’ perspective,” says the filmmaker.
