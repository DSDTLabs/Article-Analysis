NEW DELHI: After   University Students’ Union protested against the compulsory   for all categories, the teachers’ union too has decided to not cooperate with the “penalty being imposed on students and teachers alike”. The students and teachers, on Friday, staged a protest against the vice-chancellor’s order.

 According to the teachers, maintaining records of students who can take courses from any centre and drop out of them is “unproductive” and adds load to a teacher’s work. “To expect centres and teachers to maintain records of attendance for students doing coursework, especially in a university where a student may take courses from any centre, drop them formally, or drop out of them, is to load teachers with a highly unproductive and meaningless form of bureaucratic work,” said a teachers’ union statement.
 
 They also pointed out that expecting a student, who might have to travel outside the city for coursework, to mark attendance in college every day is also “ridiculous”, “when every month research supervisors and chairpersons sign on fellowship forms certifying their presence and satisfactory progress”.
 
 The teachers’ union has called on other centres to discuss the matter and submit their resolutions to the union.
