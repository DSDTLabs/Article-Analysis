AHMEDABAD: Even as an internal inquiry has been ordered into the razing of a   built on private land, it was decided in a high-level police officials’ meeting on Friday that henceforth every chowky built under the private-public partnership programme will need a nod from the police commissioner’s office.

   , the owner of the land on which the Nikol police chowky was being constructed for a year, brought down the structure three days ago. The demolition sparked a major controversy as cops claimed that Prajapati had orally consented to the construction. However, Prajapati, who initially said that the chowky was an encroachment on his land, remained tight-lipped after he and the driver of the vehicle used in the razing were brought to the Nikol police station.
 
 City police chief   said though the local police have stated that oral consent was given by Prajapati, this was not the best way of doing things. “I think it is our mistake in the first place,” Singh said. “I am personally reluctant to take help from outside quarters for police buildings.” DIG Sector-2   said that the consent to build chowkies will now be given only after proper documentation has been done and negotiations with land owners have concluded.
 
 Questions are also being raised about some police chowkies built by history-sheeters and builders with dodgy antecedents. “Why should we take land from the private parties when the government can grant us land?” said Vaghela. “However, in the case of police chowkies that have already been built, we have asked for details of owners and construction expenses.”
