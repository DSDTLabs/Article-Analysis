Amritsar: Jallianwala Bagh massacre, contribution of Sikhs in the world wars and hate crimes — all these found a mention in UK’s first Sikh woman MP Preet Kaur Gill’s inaugural address in the parliament. UK-based Sikh federation issued an excerpt of the Labour party MP from Birmingham Preet Gill’s speech on Friday.

 In her address on September 13, Preet said, “It is an honour to be the first female Sikh to represent people on these benches. There comes a huge sense of responsibility and many others will be asked to raise difficult issues in the House on behalf of Sikh community on matters of hate crime, Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Sikh ethnic monitoring in the 2021 census and an independent public inquiry into involvement of UK in the 1984 Sikh genocide.”
 
 “Sikhs have lived in this country for many decades, paid their taxes, fought in wars and have also contributed to society in every way. It is a historic moment for Sikhs in this country because parliament is representing the people it serves. Sophia Duleep Singh, the granddaughter of Maharaja Ranjit Singh— ruler of the formidable Sikh empire from 1801 to 1839—and the goddaughter of Queen Victoria would have been immensely proud as United Kingdom has elected its first female Sikh MP some 100 years after her movement for women of this country to gain the right to vote,” she further added.
