PANAJI: After beating the previous best scores held by Goans in various national entrance exams, Panaji-teenager Pratheek   has now outdone the earlier record at BITSAT. He has scored 426 out of 450. Raunak   had scored 411 in 2008, which remained unbeaten for nine years.

 Prior to Sakhardande, no student from Goa had touched the score of 400. 
 
 BITSAT is the entrance exam held for admissions to one of the campuses of the prestigious   and Rebello has qualified for a seat to any course of his choice.
 
 But, like Sakhardande, who eventually joined the   (IIT), Mumbai, for Rebello too, IIT is the first choice. “I am waiting now for the IITJEE (Advance) results, from which I will know the course in IIT I will be joining,” said Rebello.
 
 Two days ago, the student of Panaji’s Mushtifund Aryaan Higher Secondary School topped the country at the Manipal engineering entrance exam with a score of 190 out of 200.
 
 “What makes BITSAT a tough exam to crack is that students are tested not just in physics, chemistry, mathematics, but also in English and logic. And there is negative marking, too. Most students don’t even target 400. They target 350 to 360. Pratheek has shown students that touching and crossing 400 at BITSAT is possible,” said director of Mushtifund Aryaan Higher Secondary School, Vynkatesh Prabhudesai.
 
 Rebello had unlocked the bonus 12 questions at BITSAT, which are given to students that attempt all the initial questions given at the test.
 
 The teenager had earlier scored over 95% at the state board Class XII exams and had become the first in 12 years to top in physics, mathematics and chemistry individually at the Goa Common Entrance Test.
