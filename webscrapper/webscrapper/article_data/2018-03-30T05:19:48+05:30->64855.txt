KOLKATA:   on Thursday asked several city schools cum examination centres to conduct ‘drills’ to   within the stipulated time to reduce the possibility of any further ‘leaks’. Till Wednesday, schools were required to open the seal to distribute question papers — delivered to them from vaults — among the candidates. From Monday, however, things are likely to change.

 The move comes a day after CBSE declared   in mathematics for Class X students and economics for Class XII candidates.
 
 
 Schools have been asked to upload the mean time on websites within which they could download 600 question papers. “It was a method to see how quickly the system is working,” said a source from a city school. He added, “CBSE had set a time frame within which they asked the examination venue incharge to download the question papers. The accurate time had to be conveyed to them.”
 
 Through Thursday’s training, CBSE aimed at understanding the feasibility of the method. The result, however, varied between schools in metro cities, towns and suburbs. “In cities like Kolkata the examination venues are relatively large and fitted with modern gadgets and digital support system. These ensured a quick download of examination papers. However, the schools in the districts faced severe difficulty,” pointed out a principal.
 
 Among the problems faced by such schools were lack of infrastructure to download large number of question papers within the given time, absence of laser printers and insufficient number of computers. Principal of a school in South-24   said that he could download the question papers between 21 minutes and 24 minutes. “Some schools took up to one hour,” added a venue incharge. In Kolkata, some venues have as many as 1,800-2,000 candidates combining Class X and Class XII students.
 
 Most principals havelauded the effort by CBSE, claiming this mechanism will be able to reduce the possibility of any further “leak” of question papers.
