CHANDIGARH: "We are extremely disrespectful towards women and their bodies. We have no respect for them at all," said  , the celebrated Hindi author and critic at  ,   during a special literary interaction that was organised by   here on Saturday morning. 

 The Sahitya Akademi Award winning writer and the author of 'Kyonki Ek Samay Shabd Hai' while addressing the audience spoke about the perspective of men towards women. He also spoke about the nation being coloured with shades of lust and evil. Giving an example about his students, he said when he used to talk about Leonardo Da Vinci's famous painting, Mona Lisa, and thinking of unclading her with his artistic vision, some of his students used to smirk and display a lecherous interest in the woman's body, so he would often reprimand them and ask them to go and get the 'cataract' in their eyes treated which does not enable them to look at the beauty of a person, without bringing in lewd connotations. 
 
 Megh, who was honoured with a Sahitya Akademi Award in December, 2017, is among the most noted critics of the Hindi language and is also called the father of 'progressive criticism' and a veteran critic in the field of 'Saundaryashastra', both of the philosophies which find root in his research and critical analysis.
 
 "I do not believe plainly in criticism. I think criticism should be constructive and progressive. We have long practiced a very obsolete form of criticism which does not bring any good to anyone. Hence, I hope the process and the perspective of criticism changes," said Megh. 
 
 The writings of Megh have been greatly influential for a generation of young authors and writers of Hindi literature.
