MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday asked the state government to inform it of the progress in framing a policy for emergency organ transplants. A division bench of Justice   and Justice   gave the state two weeks to file its affidavit. "The question is how to balance regulations with emergency retrieval of organs," it observed. 

 Government pleader   said the state was considering the framing of guidelines. The court was hearing a petition filed in August by   resident Swapnil Rawat - he is on the waiting list for a kidney transplant - seeking organ and tissue retrieval from a 71-year-old brain dead man admitted to a hospital in  . The man died before the permissions could be in place.
