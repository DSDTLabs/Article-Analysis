 Review: The rather short album starts out on a upbeat note with What The F sung by   and Praveen Lakkaraju himself. Adnan's trademark voice and the groovy beats combine to great effect to create a very catchy chorus that is sure to get the audience moving and shaking. Lipsika and Revanth take up vocal duties for the slow and sensual sounding Ravera. The evocative singing and the mild instrumentation do well to recreate the vibe. Sung partially in English, the song's lyrics impress as well. The most energetic track out of the three, Aisa Laga sung Mohana Bhogaraju, Simha and Praveen is an out and out mass number. The beats are infectious and the vocalists do a great job in bringing that rustic vibe to the song. The song is sure to be a hit. The album is focussed and gets the job done, and how!
