LUCKNOW: Treasury benches stalled House proceedings demanding apology from   leader   aka ‘Lallu’ for his claim that two   members in protest had stripped in the House in the past and TV footage of the same was available.

 A day after BJP took strong note of paper balls hurled at Governor   during his speech, Lallu cited an example wrongly of the national party having resorted in the past to more disgraceful forms of protest. Lallu was wrong in that the said protest was by RLD members to highlight the plight of sugarcane farmers in the state in 2014. 
 
 Lallu’s allegation drew sharp reaction from parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna who said the statement was false and has been made with an intent to malign the image of a national party that was ruling in state and at Centre.
 
 Leader of Opposition Ram Gobind Chaudhary tried to diffuse the tension saying Lallu only wanted to draw comparison with a past incident but Khanna did not relent.
 
 Speaker Hridaya Narayan Dixit asked Lallu if he would apologise for his unsavoury remark. The   leader initially argued saying he what he meant was that the incident took place in presence of BJP members. BJP MLA Dalbir Singh, who was then RLD leader in the House clarified that it was two RLD members who had stripped and not BJP members. 
 
 Lallu finally said if he had made any unsavoury remark against BJP members, it should be removed from records.
