BENGALURU: Karnataka may have pioneered tech-based   but when it comes to the number of   installed here, it doesn’t figure among the top 10 states.

 As on January 1, 2016, Karnataka occupied the 12th spot, with only 340   cameras. As per ministry of home affairs data, it’s way behind states like Punjab (5,169), Delhi (4,064), Maharashtra (3,449) and Rajasthan (1,616).
 
 Senior police officers say more cameras are being procured, but even that will take the total number to only 1,000. Authorities are planning to add 5,000 cameras in total, but considering this would take a few years state police will still lag behind their counterparts elsewhere in the country. 
 
 The recent probe into the alleged molestations on New Year’s eve was heavily dependent on CCTV cameras. Prompted by the investigation, the government had announced installation of 5,000 cameras in the state.
 
 A senior police officer, however, pointed out that Bengaluru is one of cities with the highest number of CCTV cameras used for surveillance. “CCTV cameras are installed based on the requirement. Bengaluru needs a larger concentration of cameras and we are focusing on that. The fact that police officers from other states visit our command centre and traffic management centre speaks volumes about our capabilities,” he said.
 
 Maximum no. of handheld cams
 
 Though they trail behind in the number of CCTVs, Karnataka police have surpassed their counterparts in handheld digital cameras used in investigation. As on January 1, 2016, Karnataka police had 3,952 digital cameras for investigation, traffic management and security.
 
 Of these, 2,580 were used for investigation — capturing the crime scene, crowd control and other policing activities. Karnataka is followed by in   (2,977) and Kerala (2,458).
