‘Avengers: Infinity War’ is by far the most anticipated superhero movie of all time as it took over a decade and 17 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to finally set up this clash of epic proportions. The first trailer that dropped in November 2017 broke the record for the most watched trailer of all time in 24 hours.

 And now, with just about five weeks to go for the much-awaited release of the film, the makers have released another trailer.
 In the trailer, the villain,  , who has been teased in bits and pieces since the first   movie in 2012, has finally arrived to locate and conquer the six infinity stones to defeat the Marvel superheroes and put an end to the universe. The trailer will tease you with a lot of information and hinting at, possibly, some deaths too.
 
 The good news is that you’ll finally get to see the much-awaited crossover between Guardians of Galaxy, the likes of  ,  , and Spider-Man.
 
 But there’s plenty of potential peril in the trailer too. Thor’s head is seen getting squeezed by Thanos, while Iron Man’s armor is heavily damaged in the battle and Captain America struggles to hold off the Mad Titan. Also, we see Doctor Strange being tormented by Thanos’ army.
 
 The film is all set to release world wide on April 27, 2018.
