MUMBAI: Several ENT specialists from the BMC-run hospitals took to the streets on Wednesday to spread awareness about the health hazards of unnecessary honking. Honking remains one of the key causes behind the city’s raging noise pollution levels.

 The health professionals counselled taxi drivers outside KEM Hospital in Parel —one of the nosiest areas in the city despite featuring in the list of silent zones—and the Irla junction in Vile Parle on the occasion of International Noise Awareness Day. “Most people don’t understand it affects their own hearing as much as that of others who are exposed to the continuous noise,” said Dr Hetal Marfatia, ENT head at KEM. A 2017 survey by   had found the noise levels outside KEM to be double that of the permissible limit of 50 dB during the daytime. On Wednesday, doctors from the hospital along with members from NGO Chhaon counselled taxi drivers, explaining them how continuous honking could give rise to irritability, sleep disorders, heart and blood pressure problems and perhaps even contribute to road rages.
 
 Dr Samir Bhargava, consultant at Cooper Hospital, said that there is evidence to show that traffic policemen, who are exposed to high frequency noise can suffer from premature hearing loss.
