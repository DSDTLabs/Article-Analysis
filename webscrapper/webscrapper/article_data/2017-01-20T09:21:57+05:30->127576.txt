MHOW:   in   had been a favourite haunt for a leopard last summer. 

 However, for some reason it chose not to make any unwanted appearances from monsoon to the winter.
 
 But in the wee hours of Thursday, it decided to make a comeback. It entered a house on the outskirts of the village on which side a dam was situated. Since it was a cold night, all the members of Ramprasad's family decided to sleep inside the house. Kamla, Ramprasad's wife, suddenly heard the goats and cow crying loudly at about 4am.
 
 The place where the cattle and goats are kept is about 50 metres away from their house. She asked the other family members to get up and when they flashed a torch light on the area, they found a fully grown up leopard with the neck of one of the calves in its jaws. They shouted and hurled stones at it, after which the wildcat it left the calf there and fled towards the jungle on the other side of the pond.
 
 Ramprasad said that this was probably the fourth animal he had lost to this particular leopard, which lives in the nearby jungle and comes to the village in search of food and water. 
 
 He said this was surprising as there was enough food and water in the forest itself for the animal to consume.
 
 The village sarpanch   said that a case will be sent to the forest office so that Ramprasad could get compensated for his loss.
