MUMBAI: The city on Sunday recorded a   of 37.6 degrees Celsius, the third highest maximum temperatures for the month of   in the last five years. The maximum temperatures recorded on Sunday were 5-6 degrees Celsius above normal value, said officials from the   (IMD).

  attributed the increasing temperatures to the easterly winds that bring in warm air and sea breeze setting in late.
 
 The all-time record for the hottest February day is 39.6 degrees Celsius on February 25, 1966.
 
 On Sunday, the maximum temperatures recorded by IMD Santacruz observatory was 37.6 degrees Celsius, which was 5.5 degrees Celsius above normal, and by IMD Colaba observatory 36.5 degrees Celsius, 6 degrees Celsius above normal. Minimum temperatures too were seen hovering around 20-22 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal.
 
 It was the third highest maximum temperatures recorded in February since 2013 considering that the highest recorded maximum temperature in February was 38.8 degrees Celsius on February 19, 2017, and the second-highest was 38.8 degrees Celsius on February 23, 2015. 
 
 “This is a transition period from winter to summer and temperatures are seen rising upwards. It may increase further in the coming days,” said Ajay Kumar, a scientist from IMD Mumbai, explaining the reason for the high temperatures. “There is a trough which runs from Lakshadweep to west Madhya Pradesh accross south Konkan and also another trough from South Arabian sea off Kerala coast to south Maharashtra coast. This system is giving the city easterly winds, which are warm and coming from the land. This is also causing sea breeze over the city to set in late owing to which temperatures are rising.”
 
 Sea breeze setting in late means higher pollution levels in the city. The System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research recorded an Air Quality Index of 241 on Sunday as compared to 237 on Saturday. An AQI between 201 and 300 is harmful for the health of sensitive people.
