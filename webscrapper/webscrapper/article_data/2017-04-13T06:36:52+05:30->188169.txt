THANE: The rising   level, that shot up to above 40 degrees Celsius early this week has forced   to make changes in their  . 

 While some prefer taking cabs or autos to cover even short distances instead of walking, other opt to skip work on days they feel extremely run down because of the  . 
 
 While the maximum temperatures touched 40 degrees Celsius over the past few days, the minimum   rose from 21 degrees Celsius to 27.1 causing an increase in humidity and discomfort. 
 
 Joseph Almeida, a 28-year-old Louiswadi resident, who travels to Andheri daily for work, said, “I usually take a rickshaw to Thane station followed by a train and the metro to get to work. However, lately this routine has begun draining all my energy because of the heat and humidity during my travelling time. I have now started taking a cab to go to work and come back.” 
 
 Many adventure and hobby groups in the city, too, have adjusted their meet timings and prefer to meet after sunset in order to escape the scorching heat.
 
 Dighambar Chaudhari, founder of a city-based cycling group, said, “The heat is terrible and cycling under the scorching sun gets very tiring. This is why we have started our rides before sunrise and end by around 7am. We also conduct a number of night rides to get a break from the heat and enjoy the comparatively cool breeze.”
 
 Vandana Sakhardande, a 59-year-old resident of Pokhran Road 2 and member of a senior citizens’ group, said, “We used to meet near Upvan Lake in the evenings for a session of book reading or poetry recitation or even just to talk. Even though the area is close to the forest, it feels like we are sitting next to an oven. This is why we have switched our location of our meets to one of our homes.”
