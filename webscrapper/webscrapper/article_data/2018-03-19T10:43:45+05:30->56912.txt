MOHALI: The   administration is mulling over the option of increasing the floor area of the stray dog and cattle pound by adding 5 acres of land to the existing area. Dog sterilization and stray cattle pounds are situated side by side at the Industrial area phase III.

  joint commissioner   said, “We are all set to take the possession of the 5 acres of land to develop a stray dog pound. GMADA has given nod in principle and the proposal has been sent for approval to the ministry of local bodies.MC will increase the floor area.”
 
 She said that the idea is to give ample space to the dogs before and after sterilization. At present, the stray dogs being brought for sterilization are being either kept in cages or in a room.
 
 “We need to give them an open space to make them comfortable for their stay. We will also try not to keep dogs in cages pre and post-operative sessions,” said Avneet adding some more rooms will be constructed for the stateof-the-art Operation Theatre and MC plans to add a dog hospital to the premises.
 
 The stray dog sterilization team is feeling the heat of scarcity of space. Residents are chasing stray dog catchers to the sterilization centre to get them released. The doctor at the sterilization centre said, “It is very difficult to handle the residents and keep them away. They keep on coming to claim the stray dogs saying that they belong to their locality. We find it hard to make them understand that after sterilization, we will leave the dog at the same place from where it has been captured.”
 
 Till date around 657 stray dogs have been sterilized and 10 to 12 dogs are being sterilized on a daily basis now, said MC commissioner Sandeep Hans.
 
 He added, “The doctor or the other members of the staff has not approached us with such a problem. At present the sterilization process is running very smoothly and stray dogs are being sterilized on a regular basis.”
