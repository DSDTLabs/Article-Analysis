Nagpur: Nimbunabai Narnaware, 69, was assaulted by robbers, who left her tied up alone in the house, before she was rescued nearly 10 hours later by some neighbours at Dayalu Society of Mahavir Nagar in Jaripatka on Saturday. The Narnaware family, which had been staying in the locality for three decades, had only seen minor thefts in the past.

 Nimbunabai had woken up, startled by some unusual noise in her room, and was stunned to see two masked strangers standing at arms length from her at about 2am. The burglars used clothes to tie her hands and legs. She was also gagged, which did not allow her to raise an alarm. Two neighbours, who stepped into the house sensing something amiss on seeing the ajar door, found the lady lying in the house, which is being renovated. Construction work is underway in the adjacent house too.
 
 Nimbunabai had sustained some serious injuries on the right knee too, where the burglars stuck her to silence her. The elderly woman, whose blood pressure and sugar had shot up, lost cash Rs4,000 and   valuables which she was wearing. The goons left belongings strewn across the floors in all three ground floor rooms.
 
 Nimbunabai’s son Avinash, an engineer, was at a relative’s place at Besa with his son. Avinash’s wife Savita too was not at home, so the senior citizen was alone. The house doors were mostly bolted from inside, except one on the terrace. The burglars likely sneaked inside the house from the unlocked terrace door. Cops from Jaripatka police station were alerted by the neighbours, who also rushed the injured woman to Mayo Hospital. 
 
 Police were also baffled by the way family members had left the senior citizen alone. They had also come across an intact lock inside the house which the family used to lock the outside door. The case is being probed by Jaripatka police.
