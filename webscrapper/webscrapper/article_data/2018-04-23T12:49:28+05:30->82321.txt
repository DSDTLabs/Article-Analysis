AHMEDABAD: The demand in the real estate market has once again revived and this was evident at the   2018, which was organized at The  , in Ahmedabad, on Saturday and Sunday. Realtors who had put on display residential and commercial projects received a flood of enquiries over these two days. More than 6,000 people visited the Times Property Expo over the weekend, looking for homes as well as investment opportunities.

 “Over the past two days, we’ve seen a good number of enquiries, which will materialize over the next week,” said Aajan Patel, director, sales and marketing, Suryam Developers. “This is the fourth time that we are participating at the expo. It has given our projects good visibility, especially in the affordable segment. Overall, the demand for homes in the affordable segment is buoyant.”
 
 A number of prospective home buyers and investors benefited from the plethora of choices. “We’re looking to buy a house and hence I visited the expo,” said Shubhi Doshi, a visitor. “The expo had a good mix of residential projects in different areas of the city. While we’re yet to discuss and decide the choice, we certainly have a fair idea of the options available.”
 
 Neeraj Sharma, another visitor, said: “I am looking for a house in South Bopal and with numerous schemes there, it is often confusing.” Such exhibitions give buyers an idea of the available schemes, Sharma said. “I am hoping to find something that suits my budget as well as requirement,” Sharma said.
 
 Some of the major developers who were first-time exhibitors at the expo received a good response. “We received around 200 enquiries over the two days,” said Robin Goenka, chairman and managing director,  . “The market is good for consumers and those willing to buy a home can certainly look at good returns.”
