Ahmedabad:   in Gujarat want a a reduction in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate in the coming budget session. According to them, the 28%   on luxury hotels is hurting the industry in terms of leisure travellers and MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions and events) tourism, as it is the highest in Asia Pacific and Middle East markets.

 “Tax on hotels is significantly high in India (28/18/12 %) against competing international markets such as Australia (10%), Indonesia (10%), Thailand (7%), Singapore (7%) and Malaysia (6%), among others. We look forward to a reduction in the near future, as it will benefit the industry and boost tourism,” said Neeraj Govil, South Asia vice president of Marriott International, on the sidelines of the launch of the Renaissance Ahmedabad Hotel on Friday.
 
 Industry players argue that a cut in GST rates will boost the tourism sector and yield foreign currency. “In the coming budget, the government must consider a reduction of GST rates on hotels and bring a uniform rate. If the government feels they will lose revenue, they must consider the foreign exchange earned in return,” said Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants Association, Gujarat.
 
 The major chunk of international tourists in the Gujarat market are corporate travellers, particularly at Ahmedabad. “Some 45% of our guests are international travellers, including long-staying and in-transit guests. A majority of our business comes from MICE tourism. A reduction in GST rates will be passed on to customers and clients which will benefit the industry to a great extent,” said Sanjay Kaushik, general manager of Crowne Plaza Ahmedabad.
