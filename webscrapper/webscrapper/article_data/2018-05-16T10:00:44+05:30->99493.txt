GUWAHATI: After throwing its gates open to cyclists, the state zoo is now encouraging residents to adopt a healthy lifestyle by allowing trekking inside the zoo premises. The zoo will also create zoo clubs and provide annual memberships to bring people closer to the zoo. 

 "We are promoting a healthy lifestyle among the residents by allowing the people to cycle here. Besides, it also helps to build a close relationship with the people. We are glad to have an overwhelming response from the city residents who come here for cycling everyday," divisional forest officer   told TOI on Tuesday. 
 
 As per the plan, there will be a 6-kilomtre   route inside the zoo which will be opened shortly. "We can start trekking twice a month in the mornings. Two people from the zoo will accompany them. We are planning to start it in the next few weeks. The trek route is beautiful. There will be an annual membership fee of Rs 1,000 and the members can avail all the facilities,"   said.
 
 The cycling initiative, which has been welcomed by the residents, was started in November 2017. The   said 20 cyclists visit the zoo every morning on average. The zoo has at least 15 bicycles which can be borrowed and visitors can also bring their own bicycles. Individuals need to pay Rs 30 for an hour if they want to hire a cycle from the zoo authorities.
