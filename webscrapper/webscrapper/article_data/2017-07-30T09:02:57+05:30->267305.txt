THARA (BANASKANTHA): Khriya one the worst flood-hit villages in Thara taluka of  , from where bodies of 17 members of a family were pulled out of 2-3 ft of sludge early this week, is like a ticking time bomb waiting to explode.

 People here fear of an epidemic outbreak as hundreds of dead cattle are still lying unattended, some on the roof tops, outskirts of the village and in nearby farms.
 
 The stench from the already decayed carcasses has become unbearable and villagers have been left to fend for themselves with very little support from the district administration. 
  
  
 Khariya sarpanch   said not less than 1,500 cattle carcasses were lying in the village and near by fields. He fears that more dead cattle could be lying in other farms, which are still inaccessible due to flood waters and thick layers of muck.
 
 “The flood waters were so fierce that the buffaloes were flung over the rooftops. When we returned after the waters receded, we found dead cattle everywhere, some were lying on rooftops and in fields. The district authorities have provided couple of earthmovers, but they are inadequate. The carcasses have decayed so much that if you try to lift it by earthmovers, it breaks off,“ Vaghela told TOI adding, “We fear that that this could lead to epidemic outbreak in the village.“ Another villager Vanraj Thakore, wading through ankle-deep muck in his house, said he lost two of his buffaloes. “We have got little help from the government in removing the dead animals. The carcasses are in such huge numbers that it is virtually impossible for us to remove it ourselves,“ Vanraj said.
 
 When contacted Banaskantha district collector   said they have already disposed over 2,500 dead cattle from flood affected villages. He also assured that if there are dead animal still in the village, he would send teams to dispose it off immediately.
