NAGPUR: Child is father of the man, they say. Some top musicians of the film industry had effectively used items of even daily use in their compositions decades ago. A similar experiment was witnessed during ‘Umang: Ek Paul Pragatikade’ programme, staged as part of Mahila Udyojika Melava, organized by   at Reshimbagh Ground on Friday.

 Dance and musical performances were given by more than 50 students in the age group of 5 to 15 years. When their turn came to give a music performance, one of the ingenious groups appeared on the stage with household buckets, drumsticks and keyboards much to the amusement of the audience. But soon the amusement turned into awe as these children’s ‘instruments’ started creating magic, of sound. They synchronized well and worked in tandem to produce kind of a music that was quite interesting. In a way, it was an expression of ‘umang’ that they are up for experiments in the music world in future.
 
 A dance group then presented Indo-western, classical and other items. Rhythmic steps, vibrant costumes and nice execution dominated their dance performance.
 
 Ashish Mankar, music teacher of the group that caught attention of the people, said “We tried to combine learning with fun and thus came the idea to innovate for which we used buckets and created a sound which was liked by the audience. There was nothing but sound, but had the capacity to captivate.”
 
 Ashok Mehta, who was part of the team of experimentalists, said, “Such events motivate us to follow our passion and think beyond classrooms. Moreover, the children are exposed to different genres of creativity and they learn various types of art and crafts.”
 
 Varsha Thakre, chairman of the women and child welfare department of NMC, said, “Our focus is on the joy quotient of children. This is important for proper upbringing of children. Such programmes give exposure to children and bring out creativity in them.”
