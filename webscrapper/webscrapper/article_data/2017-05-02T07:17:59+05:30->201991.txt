BAREILLY: Housed in posh Green Park Extension here, the office of ‘Security Solution Services’ witnesses an uneasy calm as an employee was busy removing the name of   from the organisation's signboard at the main entrance. 

 The name painted on a wall was smudged using a sharp object to make it illegible and was later given a fresh coat of paint.
  Manager at the Bareilly branch, AJ Khan, claimed that the security services company, where both Col (retd)   and his shooter son are partners, operates in 12 states and has three centres in UP — Meerut, BareIlly and Lucknow. It employs over 2,000 people, mostly ex-servicemen.
 
  Amid reports that the absconding shooter Prashant Bishnoi, booked for violations of the wildlife protection laws, had visited the Bareilly office soon after his house in Meerut was raided by joint teams of DRI and forest department officials, staffers here categorically denied the claim. "Prashant has not been here in a long time. Colonel Saab would visit the office every month," area manager Bhagwan Dass, an ex-serviceman and close aide of the Bishnoi family, told TOI.
 
  The compound and its vicinity are under strict surveillance of CCTV cameras and Dass asserted that footages from CCTVs would only vindicate his claim. However, he failed to explain why the shooter’s name was being removed from the signboard.
 
  Several   also reached the office claiming the company had not paid their dues. “My dues of Rs 1.75 lakh have been pending ever since I left the company. Officials here have been dilly-dallying over payment," claimed  , a former security in-charge with SSS who now runs an independent security agency.
  "Such irregularities have been order of the day here. We have also been threatened in the past," said another former employee.
