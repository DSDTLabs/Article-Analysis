CHENNAI: Reduced to a bag of bones after being abandoned, an eight-month-old bull rescued by the Blue Cross volunteers earlier this week, is now recuperating in a  .

 On Monday, Blue Cross of India received a call from a local politician in Nandambakkam who had had temporarily taken in the abandoned calf.
 
 “We found the calf in a   and severely   state,” said Velu T M, a volunteer who was part of the rescue team.
 
 Once checked by in-house veterinary doctors and administered drips, the calf, fondly named ‘Pakoda’ after one of the volunteers’ nickname, stands happily at the Blue Cross shelter in Velachery. 
 
 The incident brings to light the repeated instances of male calves being abandoned or sent to the slaughterhouse once they are born, say animal activists. “There are many such cases when we are alerted to calves left to fend for themselves. The male calves are subject to abandonment,” said Dawn Williams, general manager of Blue Cross here.
 
 He added that such calves barely manage to live beyond four or five years of age.
 
 “In a number of cases male calves are bought after birth and left out to scavenge food for themselves. They are left injured in one of their legs so that they can’t run away and sold to   once they grow bigger,” said Arun Prasanna, founder of People for Cattle in India, adding that male calves are subject to worse brutality than the female ones, who are tended to until they give milk. He added that the cattle mafia is also known for selling newly born male calves as mutton in small-sized eateries.
