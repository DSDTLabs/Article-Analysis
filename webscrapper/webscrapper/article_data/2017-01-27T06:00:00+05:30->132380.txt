in a long rant that she posted on her Facebook page,   made one thing clear — she’s mighty miffed with the way things work when it comes to the ‘prestigious awards’. “...I did apply... cos I thought maybe I made the people of my country proud,” she began, before listing out her many feats and ‘firsts’ — gold at Delhi CWG, silver at Glasgow,   medal, top 10 ranked in women doubles and mixed doubles, Super Series performance and medals in  . “I’m 15 times NationaI champion and I am also the first Indian to qualify for two events in Olympics in Indian history, I'm the first Indian to win a medal after   sir in world championships and so many other firsts,” she said, before adding that her chances were marred by the fact that she is opinionated and outspoken. “should I be asking for this award...or I simply don’t deserve it. if this is not enough, what is?” she questioned. Jwala is bristling, yes, but then someone responded: “no award is greater than people’s love and affection, and you have that!” True that!
