MUMBAI: The   has filed a first information report against  , the oldest ground handling agency in Indian aviation, and Bird Worldwide Flight Service for allegedly refusing to cooperate with government officials who were confiscating the company’s equipment on court directions. The move comes days after CM Devendra Fadnavis directed the firm to immediately clear the   of employees. 

 In a press release, the state government said labour minister Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar had ordered legal action to be initiated against the company for delay in releasing employees’ pending dues. The action was taken after the company ceased operations in Mumbai leaving employees in the lurch. In August 2016, the company had written to its employees not to report to work after it lost its groundhandling contract to its competitors, Celebi and Bird Worldwide Flight Service. 
 
 Of the 2,100 employees, 722 were absorbed by the rival firms. The rest are still awaiting their salary and provident fund, said the press release.
 
 “This is the first   in the matter and we have decided to take stringent action if the firm refuses to cooperate,” said Nilangekar. “The equipment owned by Cambata Aviation are now being used by Bird Worldwide Flight Service by changing the stickers on the equipment, and the latter has refused to let the officials identify the equipment. This is against the law.”
 
 According to the FIR, on October 26, 2016, the district administration issued a notice to Cambata to deposit Rs 4.45 crore within 30 days. As it failed to do so, more notices were sent. Then, on December 22, a notice was issued informing Cambata about the seizure, but the company failed to cooperate following which the FIR was filed, said the press release.
