Surat: District development officer (DDO) Rajesh Kankipati’s audio message cheering the postponement of Garib Kalyan Mela (GKM) in Surat has gone viral on social media on Tuesday. 

 Kankipati had sent an audio message on official WhatsApp group of taluka development officers (TDOs) and other senior staff of Surat district panchayat. In the message, Kankipati addresses the TDOs saying that the GKM has been postponed and hence he wants to sing a song. Kankipati sings the song ‘Aaj mein upar, aasma niche, aaj mein aage, jaamana hai piche’. In the last line, he wishes ‘Jai Sardar’ and good night to the TDOs. 
 
 Sources said the GKM was supposed to take place in the district for three days from September 21. However, during the video conferencing with senior officials in Gandhinagar, the DDO had urged postponement of the GKM because of non-availability of assets like fishing nets etc. to be distributed among the people at the mela. The state government agreed to the request and decided to postpone the event in the district till further orders. 
 
 Asked about the audio message, Kankipati said, “I am amazed. The message has been truncated. The message was for my TDOs. I was happy that the mela was postponed as we do not have enough assets to be distributed to the beneficiaries. I had sought postponement for want of assets, which the government accepted. Surat has been ranked first in the ‘swachhta darpan’ national ranking in Gujarat. Our team in the district is working hard to achieve the targets.” 
 
 Surat district panchayat member Darshan Nayak said, “The DDO is so excited on the postponement of the GKM that he sings a song. He should have known that anyone can forward the message. It doesn’t suit an IAS officer like Kankipati to behave like this.”
