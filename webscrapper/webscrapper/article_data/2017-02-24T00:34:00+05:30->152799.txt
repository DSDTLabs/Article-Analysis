Panaji: Women fish   hailing from different parts of Goa voiced concerns over lack of protective measures at a meet and called for transparency and accountability at all levels.

 Alleging lack of support from local administration in furtherance of their business interests, they said that there is declining access to fish, which in turn is posing a threat to their livelihoods.
 
 Fisherwomen also expressed concerns over not being consulted by the authorities when their markets are being developed or new schemes introduced. They pointed out that new schemes, while strengthening male vendors, were inadvertently ending up being harmful to their interests.
 
 Fisheries department superintendent, Smita Mazumdar informed them about the schemes available for women in the sector. Methods of accessing schemes, monitoring their implementation and ensuring participation were also highlighted at the meet organized by Saad Aangan in collaboration with the International Collective in Support of Fisheries for women in small scale fisheries.
 
 The 2014 FAO-endorsed small-scale fisheries guidelines were shared with the participants pointing out how those could be used to advocate for their rights and promote their interests.
 
 The fish vendors decided to raise these issues in their own groups in respective market areas. They will also be placing their demands before the fisheries department and local self-governing bodies besides other concerned departments.
