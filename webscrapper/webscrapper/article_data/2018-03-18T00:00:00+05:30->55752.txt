It is a day of not only new beginnings, but a time to look back at the year gone by and re-live memories with family and friends, over good food and even better company, at the Upadhya household. No matter how many shows they do or how far and wide they travel, Ugadi is a time when dancer sisters   and   Upadhya always spend time at home, with mother   and other family members.

 “Ugadi eve is all about cleaning the house. We begin the festive day with decorating our respective homes, and then our mother’s house, where the entire family meets for a traditional lunch. Festivity fills the home with flowers, music and food. My mom first performs the puja, following which we take her blessings. Then, it’s time to chit-chat with family and feast on the simple, but scrumptious spread. It’s traditional Udupi fare at our home, with Anna Saaru, Neer Dose and the likes. My mom’s specialty is   and Gase Gase Payasa, which I can totally get intoxicated by (laughs),” says Mayuri.
 
 Family, adds Mayuri, is why celebrating festivals is important. “You could be globetrotting and doing hundreds of shows, but family grounds you. Given today’s lifestyle, spending the festive day with my family, doing nothing but chatting with them, is a luxury, and it refreshes me. That is a big reason celebrating festivals is important,” says Mayuri, wishing all our readers a very happy Ugadi.
