His partnership with   that helped Ferrari win five consecutive   (2000-2004) is stuff of legend in racing circles. As the current president of   (  or the  ),   is more involved with road safety these days. And the 70-year-old Frenchman seems less than chuffed about road safety in India.
“One of my big efforts as president of the FIA is to improve road safety in every country. There needs to be better law enforcement to curb drunken driving and over speeding, and the helmets should be made mandatory at any cost. It will save a lot of lives,” shares Jean,who was in Hyderabad recently to felicitate top racers from the country at an awards ceremony.
 He has some nice things to say about the progress of Indian motorsports though. “I’m very happy to see India making great strides in the international motorsports scene. India had a strong team in F1, and I hope they get back into F1 soon. More Indian companies are sponsoring racers now, and a lot of international rallying and cross-country events are being held here. I see some great results for Indian racers in the next five years, and I’m happy about that because I love this beautiful country; the people, the culture –— it’s so passionate,” he said.
 Jean has a simple word of advice for young motor sport enthusisasts in the country. “Never give up on what you are passionate about. Put every effort to become the best and stay focused. Simple words; but that’s what worked for me and Michael,” he said.
 A history buff, Jean seems to have fallen in love with Hyderabad. “I heard so much about the history and heritage of Hyderabad. It’s a beautiful place and I think the city’s got a different flavour because of its historical value,” quips Jean.
 Although he isn’t much of a foodie, Jean admits that he has been won over by Indian food. “I had chicken tikka and masala chai the other day, and believe me, They were something else!,” says Jean signing off.
