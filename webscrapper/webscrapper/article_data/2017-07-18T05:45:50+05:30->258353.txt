BEIJING: China is showing its military muscle through a “live fire exercise” involving howitzers and anti-tank grenades in  , the state media said on Monday. The brigade engaged in the drill is one that has been “responsible for frontline combat missions”, it said.

 Though the local media had earlier reported the Tibet exercise, the specific mention of howitzers comes after the Indian military began testing its M-777 A-2 ultra-light howitzers, expected to be mostly deployed along the border with China.
 
 Troops of the two countries have been engaged in a stand-off at the Sikkim border for over a month now. Beijing — based Global Times video showed artillery firing with howitzers and anti-tank grenades, as well as radar units identifying enemy aircraft. It seemed to be different from last month’s drills, which showcased the People’s Liberation Army’s ( ) most advanced Type 96 battle tank.
 
 The reports tried to give some broad hints about the brigade’s strategic capability saying it had “long been stationed around the middle and lower reaches” of Yarlung Zangbo, the Chinese name for Brahmaputra. Indian experts had earlier suggested that China has the upstream “tap” of the river and has been building dams to turn off water supply to the Indian north-east a strategic ploy. There is no water sharing treaty between India and China. The drill is focussing on boosting its “quick delivery of troops”, official media said. The Tibet Military Command of the People’s Liberation Army has two brigades and one of them carried out the drills.
 
 There was another report on July 3 which talked about n armoured brigade drill at 5100 metres in Tibet to test “combat readiness”.
 
 State media said the drills included “the quick delivery of troops and different military units working together on joint attacks”. Radar units “identifying enemy aircraft and soldiers using anti-aircraft artillery to annihilate targets” were also tested, reports said.
