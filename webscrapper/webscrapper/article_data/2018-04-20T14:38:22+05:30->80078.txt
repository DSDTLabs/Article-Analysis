He has played Lord Hanuman in two different shows –   and   – and is now gearing up to play a superhero in a TV show from Thailand. But before takinng up the new project, the actor decided to take a short break. He is currently in Jaipur, spending time with his family, especially his two-and-half-year-old daughter, Latini. “After my last show went off the air, I decided to take a break so that I can complete some other engagements. Spending some time with family in Jaipur was also on the agenda, so I came here. I am on a one-month break right now.” The actor adds, “Though my daughter keeps visiting me in Mumbai along with her mom, but there are times when I miss her a lot. Since I am in Jaipur now, I am trying my level best to just stay at home and spend time with her. After I get busy with my projects, I will be hard pressed for time.”

 Talking about his future projects, Nirbhay tells us, “My show, Sankatmochan Mahabali Hanumaan, in which I played the lead role, gained huge popularity in Thailand, where Indian mythological television shows are watched with great interest. Many Hindi shows are dubbed and being telecast there and Sankatmochan... is one of them. Seeing my popularity, a Thai director approached me to do the role of a superhero in his film, to which I gave my nod. I will join the cast somewhere in August.”

 Nirbhay, who has only been seen on mythological shows recently, says that he misses the drama of daily soaps. “I would love to do a romantic role in a daily soap. Sadly, I never ever got a chance to play one. Maybe, I don’t fit into that scheme ya shayad main akela hi kafi hun,” he jokes.
