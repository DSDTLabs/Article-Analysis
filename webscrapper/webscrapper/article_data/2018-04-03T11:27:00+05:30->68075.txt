 co-founder   has said he does not have any idea about what the future holds for the band after the death of front man  , who tragically took his own life in July aged 41. 

  
  
  The rock star had previously insisted the group would continue together but he has now revealed he does not have an 'answer' to fans asking about their new  . 
 
  ''I'm unable to say what will happen with the band. There's really just no answer, and it's funny because if I even say anything about the band's future, that becomes the headline, which is stupid because the answer is there is no answer. 
 
 ''Fans think they want to know what the future is: Believe me, I want to know what the answer is. But there just isn't one," Shinoda said.
 
  It was recently announced that the 40-year-old musician will be releasing his new music and performing tracks from his recent EP   as he makes his first solo appearance at Reading and Leeds Festivals.
