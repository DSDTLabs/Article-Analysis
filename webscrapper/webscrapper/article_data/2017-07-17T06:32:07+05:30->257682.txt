LUCKNOW: With chinks appearing in the Samajwadi Party’s armour,   is all set to clear his first test in   with flying colours during the presidential election on Monday. This is first time when three MPs, including chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi, deputy CM Keshav Maurya and Union minister for water resources Uma Bharati would vote in Lucknow and not in Delhi.

 Another highlight of the Monday’s voting is that unlike other states where only one observer has been sent, two of them have already landed in Lucknow for supervising the election — Arun Kumar Mehta, a joint secretary at the Centre and VK Pandey, director, legal, at the ECI.
 
 One UP MLA had sought to vote in Parliament House, but the Election Commission of India turned down his appeal as he failed to submit any substantial reason for not being able to vote in Lucknow.
 
 Althouh Kovind enjoys a substantial majority, Yogi is determined to marshal more support for him from the state which has maximum number of MLAs having largest vote value — 208. An MP — both from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha — carries a vote value of 708. With 325 members in the Assembly and 73 in Lok Sabha, the NDA candidate is all set to score maximum from the state. If BJP manages to poach on some rival MLAs, it is bound to enhance the stature of Aditya Nath.
