Tuticorin: Protests demanding closure of major copper producer Sterlite on allegations of polluting the environment and causing health issues such as cancer among people continued for the 52nd day on Wednesday. Around 500 CPI (M) cadres led by their state secretary K Balakrishnan and central committee member U Vasuki who attempted to picket the plant were arrested.  Addressing the cadre before courting arrest Balakrishnan said that their party will close the factory with the support of the public if the government failed to close it. “We will also stop imported raw materials for copper from reaching the plant and export of copper plates from the plant,” he said.  On Wednesday, Naam Tamilar Katchi coordinator Seeman participated in the protest at Kumarattiyapuram for the second time. “The ruling party has forced us to protest and fight for everything. Every day I wake up to take part in one protest or the other. Protests by the group of people under a tree here have reached many corners of the earth,” he said and asked villagers not to worry about cases registered against them. Tiruchendur MLA and DMK south district secretary Anitha R Radhakrishnan extended support to the protesters at Kumarattiyapuram. While DMK was denied permission to stage the protest against Sterlite on Wednesday morning, the party organised the protest later that day after obtaining a court direction. Students of a few colleges also took part in the agitation. Coordinator of the people’s protest against Sterlite M Krishnamoorthy claimed that more villages around the copper plant have joined the protest.  Krishnamoorthy added that women of Madathur blocked a bus operated by Sterlite for its employees and asked them not to pass through their village.
