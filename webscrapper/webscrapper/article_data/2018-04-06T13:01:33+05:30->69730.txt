TRICHY: The city police have made it compulsory for traffic and police personnel on beat duty to sport pith helmets (also called   helmet) while on duty this summer. 

 All the 170 police men and women on duty were asked to wear the pith helmets, made of coir pith and thermocol, issued to them a couple of days ago.
 
 The policemen working in the scorching sun have been affected by exhaustion as the back of their head was being exposed to the sun. 
 
 A traffic policewoman in   city said that she was comfortable with the hat. “Even though the department issues the hat every year, very few of us have worn them previously. This year, higher officials have asked us to wear it compulsorily in order to protect ourselves from the  ,” said a policewoman on condition of anonymity. 
 
 Even though the police department has been insisting on the use of such gear, some of the police personnel on duty did not comply as they felt it uncomfortable, unaware of the consequences caused by the heat. Traffic   can revert to their normal hat in the evening. 
 
 In Trichy, the highest temperature this summer has been 38C. 
 
 Apart from this, buttermilk mixed with curry leaves is being distributed to police personnel on beat duty around 11 am every day. 
 
 “The use of pith helmets will keep the traffic policemen unaffected by the heat. They should wear this on duty. We ensure that good quality of buttermilk is supplied to them,” DCP (crime and traffic) A   told TOI.
