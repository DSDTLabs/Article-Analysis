AMBALA: A   councillor has accused the   of sending   and obscene messages to her on her mobile phone. The councillor alleged that the deputy mayor had tried to harass her on previous occasions too but she resisted his attempts following which he had apologised for his conduct.

 The woman councillor lodged a complaint with the   superintendent of police (SP) on July 11 against Ram Pal, an INLD leader, for his alleged obscene behaviour. Following the complaint, SP   directed deputy superintendent of police (women) Usha to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the allegations and submit a report for further action.
 
 In her complaint to the police, the woman councillor alleged that the deputy mayor had indulged in obscene acts on previous occasions during her visit to the MC office. She alleged, “Ram Pal sent me a porn clip on June 5 over mobile phone and some obscene jokes as well. It was followed by an apology that the message was sent to me by mistake. On June 23, the deputy mayor again sent me another obscene clip.”
 
 Meanwhile, Ram Pal told police that he was not guilty. However, he agreed that porn clip was mistakenly sent from his phone, said police. Despite several attempts, Ram Pal couldn’t be contacted.
 
 DSP (women) Usha said, “The initial inquiry into the matter was completed and the file has been sent to the SP on Friday.”
 
 Speaking to TOI, Yamunanagar SP Kalia said, “I have recommended an FIR in the case. Further investigation in the matter would decide the future course of action.”
