NAVI MUMBAI: The erstwhile   ( ) will continue to play a major role for the maiden   election that will be held on Wednesday to elect the 78-member new civic house. 

 The old PMC jurisdiction, comprising the 300-year-old Panvel township and New Panvel (that includes  ), has 7 of the 20 wards and will elect 27 members. The old Panvel township along with New Panvel together constituted 38 members of PMC with 22 members from the township itself in the last council.
 
 The oldest civic body (established in 1852) had a huge jump of around 268% in voters due to expansion in the jurisdiction; with Old and New Panvel covering around 38% of the total 4,25,43 voters. 
 
 While the turnout in the 2011 civic poll was around 75% , according to the BJP Panvel MLA, Prashant Thakur, all political parties pegged it around 50% to 60% this time. Thereâ€™s also an issue of many having left their native homes in western Maharashtra and Konkan and the north Indian states as there are migrants.
 
 The new house that will accommodate increased strength of elected representatives will be located in the old township. The first general body is likely to be held at the   auditorium in Old Panvel. 
 
 The mood was sombre on Tuesday as a keen tussle between the BJP and the grand alliance was foretold with the Sena making inroads in several pockets of the 20 wards in the PCMC jurisdiction.
 
 The total number of voters in the ensuing Panvel civic poll is 4,25,453 against 1,15767 in the 2011 election. The new civic body got constituted on October 1, 2016 and the old house was dissolved. 
 
 The total increase is 3,09,686, out of which as many as 2,60,481 had filed complaints; amounting to 84% of the voters filing complaints.
