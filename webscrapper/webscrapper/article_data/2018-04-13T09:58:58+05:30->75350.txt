LUCKNOW: Barely a month after losing   election to  's  ,  's   on Thursday filed nomination as SP and Congress-backed candidate for legislative council elections due on April 26. 

 In his bid to cement alliance with BSP after failing to ensure Ambedkar's entry to Rajya Sabha as agreed, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav decided to field only one candidate against the two council seats the opposition can win, thereby paving the way for Ambedkar's entry to Vidhan Parishad. SP may nominate its state chief Naresh Uttam for one council seat, sources said. BSP national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra thanked both SP and   for supporting Ambedkar's candidature. "We thank SP, Congress for their support," he said. Asked whether BJP would again field extra candidates as in RS election, Mishra said, "BJP can field as many extra candidates as it likes, but this time it will not succeed. In RS elections, it bought votes, forced even rejected votes to be accepted and did not allow our two members currently in jail to vote because they have a problem with Ambedkar's name. They can try all they want but will not be able to defeat us this time," he said.
 
 The RS poll fiasco ended up changing the basic agreement between BSP and SP under which Mayawati had promised to support SP in Lok Sabha byelections and legislative council elections. While saying that the RS election loss would not impact SP-BSP ties, Mayawati had remarked that Akhilesh displayed political immaturity and should have ideally first ensured BSP candidate's win. Yadav reacted saying, "I have a big heart and if I get an opportunity, I will give whatever is required to be given."
 
 With 324 MLAs, BJP is sure of winning 11 of the 13 council seats. SP has 46 MLAs and will comfortably win one seat and will have 17 spare votes. As BSP has 18 MLAs, the two together can win 13th seat without support from Congress' seven MLAs.
