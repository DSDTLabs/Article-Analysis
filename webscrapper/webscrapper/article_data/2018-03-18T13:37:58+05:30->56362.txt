CHARMINAR: Lower priced commodities from China have been wreaking havoc among local businesses in the   and the latest to feel the heat are the agarbatti (incense stick) manufacturers. The loss of profits and manpower has been such that some businessmen have been forced to down their shutters. 

 Once upon a time, local agarbattis used to be exported to China and other countries, but the tide has turned. Today, even the wholesale and retail traders are going after the China-made incense sticks as they are cheaper. While the local agarbattis are available for 150-400 per kg, the Chinese equivalent can be purchased for 120-300 per kg. 
 
 Traders say the demand is fuelling the sales of China-made agarbattis. "There was a time when local agarbattis used to be exported and manufacturers were happy with their business. Now the cheaper and more profitable China Agarbatti dominates the markets," said  , a wholesale dealer in the Old City.
 
 But for the manufacturers, it is a story of unrelenting loss. "I had four agarbatti manufacturing units with 24 workers. But the fall in profits and lack of interested workers forced me to shut down two units. Now, I run the remaining two units with hardly 10 workers," said  , a local manufacturer. 
 
 He added that the agarbatti business was earlier spread in areas such as Talabkatta, Hasan Nagar, Ballaguda and KishanBagh, but only a few units are left in these localities.
