Vasco: The   Advisory Committee (AAC) which met on Wednesday discussed issues pertaining to taxi operators, land for parking of vehicles and others.

 Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida has asked the airport authorities to educate tourist taxi drivers on etiquette. 
 
 Almeida while speaking to TOI said that, “I have requested for such classes so that they are taught how to greet passengers by saying ‘good day’ , behaving well with them, desisting from picking fights and hurling abuses.”
 
 He said this was very important in the backdrop of recent cases and complaints that passengers have reported involving unruly behaviour and fights among drivers over passengers.
 
 On the other hand, South Goa MP and chairman of the AAC Narendra Sawaikar said that, “Various issues were taken up, especially on the need for taxi counters and land for parking. We have tried sorting out problems before the season starts.”
 
 Sources informed that Sawaikar would be meeting Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar over the land acquisition issue for parking at the airport. Airport Director BCH Negi, officials from transport, tourism departments as well as others were also present.
