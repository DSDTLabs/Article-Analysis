KOLKATA: In order to reduce man-animal conflict and rescue animal or man trapped in conflict, the forest department is raising a rapid response team (RRT). “It is a rapid response team that would be equipped with forest official, personnel with animal rescue training and equipment, veterinary surgeons and a smart vehicle with rotating search lights fitted atop it. Each vehicle costs Rs 20 lakh. Five such teams will be stationed at various parts of the state. While two teams will be stationed in north Bengal, two will take care of south   and one will be used in Kolkata. We are also launching a dedicated toll free number for alerting this force,” said forest minister   in the assembly.

 “In Kolkata, we often receive complaints about sudden intrusion of wild animals into house. It is because of the loss habitat. People often kill the animals out of fear or do act which leave the beast further scared and aggressive. This team will handle such situation and rescue the wild animals and release it to an area conducive for its survival,” he added. 
 
 The RRT will be equipped with arms to tranquillise all animals, even big animals like rhinos and Indian gaurs. Besides, the state government is enhancing the team called ‘Airavat’ (mythical war elephant and the pet of Lord Indra) that is dedicated to reduce man-elephant conflict. Only four Airavat teams were there in   and Purulia regions. Its success led forest department to increase the number from four to eight. “Now, Airavat will be deployed in north Bengal as well,” said Burman.
 
 Airavat, which is equipped with hooter and public address system will be able to follow a herd of elephants and restrict it from destroying crops in the field. “When elephant herd moves, people must be peaceful. But they did the opposite by panicking. This led elephant to be scared and aggressive. The Airavat rushed to the spot fast to salvage the situation and restrict the elephant from destroying crops. Because of Airavat, the man-elephant conflict has come down substantially. The forest department now updates every person entering an elephant corridor with exact number of elephants in the zone with sms.
 
 Forest department officers blamed the humans for the conflict. “First, humans have destroyed their home. Now, people try to hurt them when they come to the villages for food. If the villagers don’t panic and keep calm, we can easily channelise them out of human land using the new vehicle. But, people raise a hue and cry and try to trap the elephants, which makes them more aggressive,” he said.
