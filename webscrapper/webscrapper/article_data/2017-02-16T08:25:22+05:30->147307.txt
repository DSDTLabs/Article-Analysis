AMARAVATI: The newly constructed   building   is ready to hold its   next month.
Notwithstanding the delay, the assembly building block in the interim government complex (IGC) here, has come up with most advanced facilities. Both the assembly and legislative council blocks have been accommodated in one building.
 
  (CRDA) commissioner  , who personally monitored the work, insisted on the contractor to use the world's best equipment in the construction. The sophisticated mikes, which were imported from Germany, will be very difficult for the members to snatch. Interestingly , the microphone of the members would be activated via wi-fi network following the instructions of the assembly speaker. “The microphone in front of the member will get activated only when the speaker gives him or her an opportunity,“ said an official. The gypsum roof was carved with glittering lights. The flooring of the assembly has been decked up with a luxurious granite and it almost resembles glass flooring. “It has come out beautifully,“ said municipal minister P Narayana. He said that they have completed such a massive structure within a short span of 10 months.
 
 A media gallery was also constructed on the first floor with a capacity of 100 seats.
