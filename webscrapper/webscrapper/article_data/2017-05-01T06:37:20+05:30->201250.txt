AMRITSAR: Punjab’s first night   Urban Haat, constructed on the lines of neighbouring  , has failed to attract customers, following which the administration has decided to give it to a private company. A dream project of former deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal, who announced having Punjab’s own food street here after his Pakistan visit in 2012, had inaugurated the   on May 15, 2016.

 Since its inauguration, only a couple of traders showed interest to open shops there but they also left after the   (PUDA) failed to attract any more shopkeepers.
 
 On a visit to Urban Haat on Tuesday, TOI found all shops locked with stray dogs taking shelter and weeds growing on pavements. Urban Haat has five blocks with guest rooms, dormitories, souvenir shop, craft bazaar and an open air theatre. “I was very curious about the project and became the first person to open shop in the Urban Haat. I even paid the initial amount to PUDA and opened my shop but I couldn’t sustain since there was no customer,” said Jasbir Singh, owner of a chicken and fish eatery. He said due to PUDA’s failure to attract more shopkeepers, he had to close the shop and thus suffered a loss of around Rs 4 lakh.
 
 Executive engineer (XEN) of PUDA Surjit Singh admitted that the agency couldn’t operate the Urban Haat due to lack of expertise and manpower. He said earlier it was decided that PUDA would operate the food street and the crafts bazaar but now they decided to give it’s operation to a single party on the lines of Sada Pind.
 
 However, there is much resentment among businessmen aspiring to have their shops in Urban Haat. “I made several rounds to the PUDA office for taking a shop on rent but no one guided me. All I was told was that it will reopen soon. But now I think my dream to have a shop in the Urban Haat will shatter as it is going into private hands and the operator would charge too much rent for the shops,” said Navtej Singh, a kulcha shop owner in Ranjit Avenue.
