 "I dressed girly in kurtas, bindis and braids because I loved Bharatanatyam. But my nani would give me junk food, put me in shorts, let my ringlets free, and send me out in the mud to play." Her obsession with floral scents goes back to memories of her mother's large collection of handloom saris that she wore with mismatched blouses.
 
 "When she would go for a shower, I would pick up her sari and wrap it around myself. She would come out and ask me to take something cleaner, prettier. But it smelled of her, of comfort and tea rose," added the actress, who has worn a specific perfume for every role of hers, whether it is Leela in 'Kaatru Veliyidai' or Mehrunissa in 'Padmaavat'.
