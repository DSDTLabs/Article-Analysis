KOLKATA:   Green Tribunal (NGT), Eastern Zone Bench, on Thursday, directed the   secretary, senior officials of  , those from the state government and heads of two private firms tapping Coal Bed Methane from Asansol area to appear before it on September 1 and explain what steps are being taken for the supply of natural gas to the eastern region. 

 The bench of Justice S P Wangdi and professor P C Mishra heard an application by green activist Subhas Datta, in which, he pointed out that eastern India has nearly 45% reserves of natural gas in the country but is receiving no supply of green fuel.
 
 In 2016, the green bench had directed central and state agencies to sit together and chalk out a plan for supply but there was no progress. 
 
 "The NGT came down hard on the ministry for its inaction or wrong action in this matter. We are happy over this stand by the NGT," Datta said.
