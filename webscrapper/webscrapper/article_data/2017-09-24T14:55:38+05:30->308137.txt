NAGPUR: Following   reports, the   not just took note of the blunder in master of social work (MSW) third semester syllabus but also amended it by replacing its content.

 However, no action has been taken beside issuing a corrigendum regarding the syllabus. Though the goof up threatened to disrupt the career prospects of students planning to pursue higher studies abroad, the   failed to fix responsibility in the case. 
 
 Initially, the NU was even reluctant to treat the issue on priority. Several teachers and students were concerned as the winter exams neared.
 
 On September 10, TOI reported about the goof up and how the varsity had taken the issue lightly. Following the report, the NU convened a meeting of Master Social Work (MSW) teachers and special task committee to resolve the issue of repetition of a topic in third semester syllabus. 
 
 It was expected that the NU would penalize or take action against the committee which prepared the syllabus.
 
 Vice chancellor SP   had pleaded ignorance about receiving any letter on the syllabus goof up when TOI had sought his comments.
 
 Acting VC   didn’t answer to TOI calls on Saturday.
 
 Sources said teachers and students had demanded action but the NU ignored it. “This would send a wrong message that people can get away with any mistake however serious it may be. The NU bosses must learn from mistake and set an example that officials and committees dealing with courses remain careful in future,” they said.
