The city also has many international sporting venues like cricket, hockey and indoor stadiums, and a golf course. World Trade Centre, Medicity and Aerocity add to its brand value. It has 10 industrial areas that are largely developed.

 Former member of the   and noted startup expert  , however, added a note of caution. He pointed out some obvious things that need to be taken care of for Mohali to ride the wave. “There is no convention centre here, unlike Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai. We need to address lack of capacity building plans like   did in Gurgaon. There is gap in implementing public policy too,” he explained.
 
 Vatsayan, also underlined the fact that though land is readily available in Mohali, ready commercial space is not. “Look at Quarkcity. It’s already 80% occupied. Investors and entrepreneurs want ready-to-shift buildings,” he added.
 
 Punjab industries department secretary   said these lacunae are also being plugged. The new industrial policy of the state has already announced that a convention centre would come up at Mohali. He also said that IT sector is among the thrust sectors for the state government and there are now schemes like exemption from stamp duty on purchase or lease of land, 100% exemption CLU and external development charges. To top it all, some units can even avail of rent reimbursements under the new policy, he added.
