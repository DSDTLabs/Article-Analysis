MADURAI: Officials of the   department on Tuesday appeared before the Madurai bench of the Madras high court in a case relating to the detention of the director of Bangkok-based organisation   – Asia  , two months ago. 

 People’s Watch executive director   filed a habeas corpus petition (HCP) seeking to produce Kattel before the high court, when the immigration department detained him at   airport. 
 
 Tiphagne had said that Kattel, a Nepali was known to him for the past 10 years. He is the director of Forum – Asia, a developmental organisation in Bangkok, and having status of economic and social council of the UN. He also worked as a senior advisor at Danish International Development Agency’s Human Rights and Good Governance Program in Nepal. 
 
 Kattel was on his way to meet him in Madurai. But, when he reached Trichy airport on December 20 midnight from  , immigration officials detained him and kept him in illegal custody, Tiphagne had claimed. Since he is a Nepali citizen, Kattel does not require a visa to enter India for a vacation, the petitioner said. 
 
 When the case came up for hearing before the division bench of justices S   and T Krishnavalli, the immigration department officials appeared and said that they had detained Kattel, based on instructions from their superior. Also, he was detained only for a while, which was not illegal. 
 
 However, the petitioner’s counsel wanted to adjourn the case to engage a senior lawyer. Following it, the court adjourned the case by a day.
