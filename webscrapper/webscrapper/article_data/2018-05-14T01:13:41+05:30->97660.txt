NEW DELHI: A 40-year-old man, who is allegedly mentally unstable, was arrested on Sunday for killing his elderly parents by setting ablaze his house in west Delhi’s Moti Bagh. A tenant, Vinay, also sustained burn injuries in the incident.

 The accused man, identified as Santosh, killed his parents, Chhedi Lal (70) and Laxmi (62), in the early hours of Friday and fled from the spot. The fire broke out at 3.30am and engulfed the entire building. 
 
 Three fire tenders were rushed to the spot to douse the flames. The injured parents were rushed to a nearby hospital where they were declared brought dead.
 
 Santosh used to keep an oil container with himself and had tried to immolate himself some time ago. He also used to burn garbage on the street using the oil. On Friday, he poured the oil on household items, set them on fire, locked his parents inside the house and fled.
 
 “The door of the tenant’s room was also found closed, most likely shut by Santosh after lighting the fire. Chhedi Lal had managed to unlock the door and had tried to get his wife out as she had problems in walking. However, by then the fire engulfed the entire house making their escape impossible,” said the officer.
 
 DCP (west) Vijay Kumar said that they arrested the man from one of his hideouts after which he confessed to committing the crime. “We conducted a probe on the allegations of family members and found Santosh to be mentally unstable. He used to often have arguments with his parents. He also used to thrash his parents and snatch money from them. He used this money to buy drugs and alcohol,” said a senior investigator.
