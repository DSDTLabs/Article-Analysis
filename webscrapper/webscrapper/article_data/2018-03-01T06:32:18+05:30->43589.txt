MUMBAI: Nearly 35 lakh   who have suffered   due to   will have to wait longer for relief, that too not the full amount.

 The fate of the affected farmers hangs in balance as the Centre has raised several queries on the proposal moved by the state seeking Rs 2,425 crore in compensation. The state government has sent a proposal seeking compensation for farmer losses and the destruction incurred due to Ockhi cyclone under the   (NDRF) in January. Of the total compensation package, Rs 2,100 crore is to extend relief to cotton farmers Officials said that most of the queries raised by the Centre are regarding the methodolgy used to ascertain losses and the state government is struggling to answer these queries. Officials say that the Centre is in no mood to dole out funds without proper procedure being followed to ascertain losses and relief amount.

 One of the trickiest queries is that whether or not ‘ground truthing’ analysis was done to ascertain the area ravaged. The state government does not follow this methodology ,it follows a slightly less scientific methodology of ‘crop-cutting experiments’. Under ground truthing, a detailed field survey is required, aerial imagery, surveys and consultations with the farmers are also required. This data is not possible for the government to obtain as the fields have been created of the pest stricken cotton crop. The memorandum sent by the state government says that of the 42 lakh hectare area under cotton cultivation over 34 lakh hectares spanning 20 districts have been affected by pinkboll worm pest.
 
 The central government has asked the state to give bifurcation of losses between 33-50% and above 50%, which the state government doesn’t have. Moreover, the debtstricken state has no fiscal space to dole out compensation on its own.
