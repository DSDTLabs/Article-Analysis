Vadodara: While the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has conducted major work to rejuvenate and beautify ponds across the city, two historical ponds are crying for help. Despite repeated demands, work has not been taken up on the Ajab Pond and Raja-Rani Pond in the eastern parts of the city.

 It is believed that the Ajab pond and the Raja-Rani pond located close to each other were the major source of water in the city. They were also key to the storm water drainage system in the city and water from the old city used to flow into them. 
 
 The ponds in the eastern parts of the city were interconnected using aqueducts. The interconnectivity began at Warasiya pond and ended at the Mohammed pond in Wadi. On its way, the Sarasiya, Ajab and Raja-Rani ponds were covered. An aqueduct also connected the Sarasiya pond to the Sursagar.
 
 The channels that used to carry water to these ponds have been damaged and not taken care of since years. It is believed that this leads to waterlogging in the walled city even in short spells of rain. The two major pipelines supplying water to the city from Ajwa Reservoir also pass through the Raja-Rani pond.
 
 Ruling BJP councillor from the area Vijay Pawar who has been raising the issue since quite some time now said that the Raja-Rani pond was ridden with encroachments. “There are shanties even on the course of the pipelines. There are leakages in the pipeline here and the residents of the slum use this water. The pond has fresh water in it due to the leakages,” said Pawar.
 
 Pawar pointed out that the inlet of water into the Ajab pond was also blocked by illegal constructions on its ‘ghat’. Pawar pointed out that a bridge had been constructed on an old stone wall between the two ponds had been plastered and a pedestrian bridge had been constructed over it. Pawar has written a letter regarding the issues to the VMC commissioner and has sought action.
