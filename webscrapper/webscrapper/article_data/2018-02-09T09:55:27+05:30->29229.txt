VADODARA: Whenever he drove out of the lane he stays in at Akota, he used to find people driving on the wrong side. Often the   and he also escaped a couple of accidents. That was when Akshay Parnami, a city-based industrialist, decided to school the Barodians who drove rashly on the roads. 

 “When I used to get down from my car and try and talk to the commuters breaking traffic rules, they used to get angry. I realized that trying to talk some sense in them was futile. So, I thought of a   wherein I would be able to convey my message to the   without getting down from my car and interacting with them,” Parnami told TOI. 
 
 Parnami got some placards made that advised people to not break traffic rules. “Now, whenever I am driving my car and see someone driving wrong side, I simply stick out a placard that reads ‘Please Drive on The Right Side. Not on Wrong Side’. The commuters coming from wrong side often read the placard and sheepishly turn back,” Parnami said. 
 
 “I have made four such placards that also have a sign of folded hands. It helps as I don’t have to argue with people and they get the message in civilized way. I see many people reading the placards that I show and smile back,” he added. Apart from wrong side driving, the other placards he made convey the message of not using mobile phone while driving, not honking unnecessarily and following traffic rules.
 
 “I carry the placards all the time in my car. Our city is growing by leaps and bounds causing increase in traffic. We, as citizens, have to understand that the traffic police is there to ensure   but we need to follow the traffic rules for our own safety,” Parnami said.
