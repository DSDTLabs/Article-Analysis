ALLAHABAD: In the run-up to the forthcoming   bypolls,   ( ) leaders are relying on 'sampark tolis' to woo first-time voters and women to ensure a win for the saffron party from the   seat, which was formerly represented by deputy chief minister   Maurya.

 Party Mahanagar vice-president   said, "Apart from forming over 2,000 booth committees in all five assembly segments of Phulpur, we have also focused on forming 'sampark tolis' to get more voters into BJP's fold. Each toli comprises two or three workers and would be interacting with voters over schemes like Ujjala and Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao schemes."
 
 The women's wing of party is trying to garner support of women voters and have been busy spreading awareness about the social security and women welfare schemes launched by the Union and state government.
 
 The party has constituted over 100 active groups or tolis, who would be campaigning door-to-door in all five assembly segments of Phulpur parliamentary constituency, which are Phulpur, Allahabad North, Allahbaad West, Soraon and Phaphamau.
