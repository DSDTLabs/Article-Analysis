He died at JJ Hospital in   on April 12. The RPF refuted the allegation of custodial torture and said the boy was already unwell.
 
 Speaking of the findings of the second post-mortem, a senior doctor said, “The boy possibly had a serious lung condition. Whether or not it was TB [tuberculosis] will be known in the histopathology report.”
 
 Afreen Khan, lawyer for the boy’s family, said that the boy had a fractured leg when he was taken to Dongri Children’s Home. “He put it on record before the magistrate that he was beaten up by security agencies. We are yet to receive a copy of his post-mortem report, but the government pleader told the court that he died of septicaemia (infection). We need to know how he contracted the infection,” Khan had said.
 
 The RPF had detained him for “barging into the ladies compartment of a Harbour line train at Kurla and stealing a doctor’s phone”.
