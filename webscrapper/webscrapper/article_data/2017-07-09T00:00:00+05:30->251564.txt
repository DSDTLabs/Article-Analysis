We are breathing stress on a daily basis. Begin your morning with the word: Chill! Managing stress isnâ€™t easy; and how you start your day defines your stress levels. To be stress free, I wake up early, stretch my hands up. Then I go for a short walk or run of 15 minutes outside. Exercise in the morning makes feel energetic. After a welcoming shower, I meditate and do yoga. I eat a healthy breakfast: Fruits, nuts and nutritious bread.

  As medical doctor, I have a busy and hectic schedules. I prepare my day with making efficient lists of what I have to do; this increases my productivity. Music and creativity are important in reducing my stress and be more productive. I listen to relaxing music on my way to work and I drink enough water to stay hydrated.
