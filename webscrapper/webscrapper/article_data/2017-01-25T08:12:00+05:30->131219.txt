NEW DELHI: The 24-year-old man who had rammed his SUV into an   near Ber Sarai on Sunday night, leading to the death of its driver, was granted bail by a city court on Tuesday. 

 During interrogation, Sohail Kohli told cops that he was driving the BMW at a speed of about 120kmph as he wanted to reach his friend’s house in Vasant Kunj quickly, but he lost control of the SUV after he had crossed the Ber Sarai traffic signal. On this stretch, the road is narrower by a lane, making it accident-prone, cops said. 
 
 Meanwhile, the family members of the 37-year-old cabbie, Nazrul Islam, plan to pursue the case until they are compensated by Kohli. They have formed a WhatsApp group and they may add families of other road accident victims as well. 
 
 Islam’s family said he was planning to reach home early because he wanted to visit the Nizamuddin Dargah on Monday morning to celebrate his daughter’s birthday. 
 
 Police said the CCTV footage recovered from the area showed the speeding BMW trying to go past other cars and Kohli driving zigzag for a few metres before ramming the SUV into the cab. Preliminary autopsy reports suggest that he had died out of an internal haemorrhage.
