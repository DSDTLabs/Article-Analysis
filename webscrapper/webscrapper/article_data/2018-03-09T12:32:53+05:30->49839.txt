  : Governor   on Thursday said women of the northeast in general and of   in particular are more empowered than women from the rest of the country. "This is because they are traditionally better placed on the social rung than their counterparts in other parts of the country," she said while addressing a gathering on the occasion of International Women' Day at Raj Bhavan. 

 "Women in this region have grown up in a more liberal society, facing less hostile challenges, unlike in a male-dominant environment," the governor said. The governor also lauded various civil society organizations and women's associations in the state for their relentless effort in the fight against anti-social evils against women.
 
 Exhorting all women to ponder the importance of their role in building society, the governor highlighted the achievements of Mirabai Chanu and Mary Kom. 
 
 "Manipuri women are leading in all spheres and have earned recognition in national as well as international levels, be it sports or any other field. They have had more economic independence, even supporting families without help from male members," the governor asserted, while citing Ima Keithel (women's market) as a clear example of   women's economic independence.
 
 Social welfare minister Nemcha Kipgen said women should be empowered across rural and urban settings and activists who are working tirelessly to claim women's rights should be celebrated.
