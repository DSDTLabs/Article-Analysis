GURUGRAM: The installation of LED   across the city has been welcomed by Gurugram residents, especially   who have always been worried about the lack of streetlights in the city. 

 Several women told TOI that they were hopeful that their   and security concerns would be somewhat allayed now. “This has been long overdue,” said Archana Deshpandey, a resident of Sector 23A. “We get scared as streetlights are dim and some areas have no streetlights at all. Some of us had even stopped venturing out in the evening. There were also some incidents of chain-snatching in the area. I hope that with the intallation of   lights, such menace would come to an end.”
 
 Residents of sectors that don’t come under MCG have shared disappointment at being left out of the project. “We understand that the project would not cover our areas but we require streetlights as well because safety and security is a issue for us too and we also vote for MCG,” said Chaitali Mandotra, a resident of Ardee City, Sector 52. 
 
 Women, especially those who reach home late from work, said that streetlights were essential because driving or travelling in the dark was a scary experience. “I work in Udyog Vihar and it’s pitch dark by the time I reach home,” said Ankita, a resident of Sector 48. “Though my area doesn’t come under MCG but the roads on which I drive do. I hope such roads will not lie in darkness now.”
 
 Another resident from Sector 50, Lovleen Kahlon, said that LED lights would go a long way in ensuring safety of women. “With streetlights, there are comparatively less chances that someone will follow you,” she said.
