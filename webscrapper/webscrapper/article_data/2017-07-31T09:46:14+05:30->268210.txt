BHUBANESWAR: The   ( ) has decided to expedite the construction of a shelter where   of the city can be put up. 

 The shelter will be for stray bulls, cows and buffaloes which otherwise walk through the city's roads with abandon, holding up traffic at key points. 
 
 Often, the cattle fight among themselves, posing a danger to commuters and themselves. 
 
 The   had last year allotted five acre of land at Jamukoli. Though the foundation stone has been laid on the site and a boundary wall has been constructed, work on the shelter is yet to begin.
 
 The BMC sources said their engineering wing has estimated that it would cost Rs 45 lakh to built the shelter.
 
 "By the end of this year, the shelter will be ready. It can accommodate 400 cattle. There will be separate sheds and a water supply facility will be made available. We will also install energy efficient   there. Greenery will also be planted to maintain the environment," said the BMC's additional commissioner Alok Kar. 
 
 Earlier, the BMC had relocated stray cattle to a cattle house at Dhenkanal, which proved to be a cumbersome process. The shelter at Dhenkanal could accommodate only 40 bulls. 
 
 "A private agency will be roped in for the daily maintenance of the house. Currently, we have only one cattle-catching vehicle. But we have plans to procure more such vehicles," said city mayor Ananta Narayan Jena.
 
 The BMC sources said every day at least two stray cows are caught by the cattle-catching squad. "Given the infrastructure at present, we are not able contain the problem fully," said a BMC officer. 
 
 The BMC has also planned to auction cattle if they are not claimed by their owners.
