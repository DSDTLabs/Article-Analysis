AHMEDABAD:  , the Indian-American author of a book on  , said that societies will have to evolve to accommodate interfaith,  ,   as countries such as India are getting more and more cosmopolitan.

 “During my visits to Gujarat and the rest of India, I have observed that the world is flat when it comes to young people’s outlook towards life and their aspirations,” Amin said. “They are not much different from a teen in the US. The difference starts when they go back home. Weddings here or elsewhere are also about the marriage between families. Thus it is important to understand the other person’s standpoint.”
 
 Amin said that as in conventional marriages, one will find both good and bad examples in interfaith marriages. “But studies in the US point at the bitter truth that the rate of divorces is about double in interfaith marriages compared to intra-faith ones,” he said. “In my book, I have included a few stellar examples where the couples understood their differences and still decided to marry. The decision has to be on the basis of knowledge and not on impulse.”
