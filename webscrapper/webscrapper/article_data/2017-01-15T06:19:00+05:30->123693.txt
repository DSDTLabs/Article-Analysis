AMRITSAR: Following the announcement of former mayor Sunil Dutti’s candidature from Amritsar North by the Congress, another party leader Karamjit Singh Rintu staged a show of strength and asked the party leadership to rethink the decision.

 “I have given one-day ultimatum to the party to reconsider its decision on Amritsar North constituency, else I will take a decision in consultation with my supporters,” Rintu said on Saturday.
 
 Hundreds of his supporters gathered at Rintu’s residence in Green Fields colony to express solidarity with him. When asked about resentment among ticket aspirants across the state,   president Captain Amarinder Singh said, “We have 117 tickets and aspirants are over 1,600.”
 
 “I have been discharging all duties assigned to me by the party at various forums with best of my abilities,” Rintu said, adding that his commitment for the upliftment of the party was unquestionable. In the 2012 assembly elections, Rintu had had lost to BJP’s Anil Joshi from Amritsar North.
 
 “During the last assembly elections, my ticket was announced just 13 days before the polling day. Everyone was surprised at the strong fight I gave to the local bodies minister Joshi,” he said, adding that if candidature had been announced earlier, the results would have been other way round.
 
 Party sources also claimed that Darbari Lal, who was given AAP’s ticket from Amritsar Central but chose to return to the Congress, was now trying to bring back Dr Ajay Gupta to the Congress. AAP had given ticket to Gupta after Lal’s flip flop.
