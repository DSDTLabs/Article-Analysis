KOLKATA: Ten editions of the Indian Premier League ( ) have gone by but   (RCB) are yet to lay their hands on the coveted trophy. 

 
 Led by India captain  , who is known to be a gogetter on the field, RCB will be looking to go all the way in IPL-11.
 
 It is important for RCB to get their campaign off the blocks on a positive note when they take on the   at the Eden Gardens here on Sunday. 
 
 It will not be easy for Kohli’s side as KKR not only have an enviable home record, but they also have a better head-to-head record, having beaten RCB 11 out of 20 times the two teams have met so far in the IPL.
 
 With a 25-member squad at his disposal, Kohli will have to deal with a problem of plenty when he picks the playing XI. KKR, on the other hand, will be hoping that their 19-member squad will remain injury-free over the next eight weeks. 
 
 The hosts have a new skipper in the form of Dinesh Karthik, but the core of their foreign force remains intact. KKR’s fortunes will depend much on how Chris Lynn, Sunil Narine and Andre Russell perform this season.
