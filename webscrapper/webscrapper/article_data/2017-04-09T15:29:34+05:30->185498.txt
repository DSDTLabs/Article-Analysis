 Pandit, who plays lead in  's Kuldeepak on & TV thinks of Mrunal Jain as his elder brother. Over the years, Mrunal has been very supportive of Shardul and here is what he has to say about it.
 
  Shardul says, "He played my elder brother's role in   but my relationship with him is exactly like that with him. He is very protective about me. He is somebody I can do anything with and take liberty. There no one moment that I don't make fun of him and Mrunal is like   guy so nobody messes up with him but I am allowed to. So like a younger brother I can take out things like I want, I can do things, I can shout at him and he allows me, that's the big equation we have". 
  
  On being asked about Mrunal he says, " He is a simple guy at heart and he finds happiness in small things. Like he called me that day when my show was not confirmed and he said he is going to a temple to pray for it and I was not telling him that it's already confirmed because I wasn't sure. He kept messaging me and later I messaged him that you went to the temple and yes it's confirmed. So that kind of stuff who does but he went to the temple just for me so that I get the show". 
  
  On being asked what advice he has given he says, " He has only told me that you are supposed to be big and you should think like that, I don't plan a lot. So he always tells me that I should really believe in myself and he thinks I don't value myself enough. He is going to   to do an international TV series and I am really happy for him".
