VADODARA: A contractual cleaner working at Alembic and his brother-in-law were cheated by three persons.

 The trio – Kaumil  , Yogendrasinh   and Raju – posing as officials of a private finance company, mortgaged the victims’ property with Punjab National Bank ( ) and took a loan of Rs13 lakh.
 
 Complainant Suresh Harijan told police that he met Raju in August 2012 after reading an advertisement of loan in newspaper. Harijan wanted loan for his daughter’s wedding. Raju later introduced Harijan and his brother-in-law Jayanti Solanki to Modi and Rana who claimed to be operating a private finance company called M Tech Hardware Private Limited on Jetlapur Road.
 
 The duo told the complainant that they will help them get loan of Rs1 lakh each against their properties. Harijan and Solanki gave the documents of their houses and they were given cheques of Rs1 lakh each within a week. However, in 2013 Harijan got a notice from PNB’s Subhanpura branch to repay the loan amount. On checking with the bank, Harijan learnt that Modi and Rana had taken a loan of Rs13 lakh on his and Solanki’s properties. Police said that out of Rs13 lakh, the duo had given Rs1 lakh each to the two victims.
 
 When the accused were confronted, they asked Harijan and Solanki to repay only Rs2 lakh and that they will pay the remaining amount. Cops said the accused did not repay the loan and when Harijan went to their office to check, it came to light that Vadodara Municipal Corporation had sealed it.
