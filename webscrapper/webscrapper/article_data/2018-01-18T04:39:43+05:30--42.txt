MUMBAI: From this Republic Day, tourists and locals will be able to enjoy the toy train ride on the entire 21-km stretch from   to Matheran. 

 Train services on the entire corridor were suspended after twin derailments in May 2016, which hit tourists as well as local residents and hotel operators who ferry provisions on it in the absence of motorable transport.
 
 “There will be only two services—one in Up direction and another in the Down direction—on the Neral-Matheran stretch from January 26,” said   divisional railway manager S K Jain. 
 
 Services on the 3km Aman Lodge-Matheran stretch had already restarted on October 30, 2017.
 
 CR officials said they have put in place a fool-proof system for the safety of passengers, including installing crash barriers, gabion walls and boundary walls.
 
 CR also plans to add more coaches to the toy train. It will soon seek permission from the commissioner of railway safety to run the rake with eight coaches. Currently, there are six coaches.
