Everyone wants to do something different to ring in the New Year, and for some waking up to fresh   and gorgeous scenery was the best way to start 2017. Scriptwriter   spent the last day of 2016 with her husband at a campsite on   beach, Alibaug. “I love to travel and seek new experiences without going too far from home, so camping out made perfect sense,” says Moitra, who enjoyed the first sunrise of the year outdoors. The trip cost her Rs 5,000 a head, inclusive of meals and a music performance. “Entry into a decent club in Mumbai with drinks would cost double this,” she says.

 Anumber of travel companies also cashed in on the trend and offered special packages for the New Year weekend. Auli, Jaisalmer, McLeod Ganj,   and Rishikesh were popular destinations for campers. A three-day New Year party at Kasol organised by We Travel Solo, a Delhi-based firm, was sold out. For Rs 8,200 a person, the trip included travel, tents, tattoo sessions, music and performances by the bonfire.
 
 Mumbai Travellers, a five-year-old travel club, sold out its lakeside and riverside campsites at   and Bhandardara, both near Mumbai. “We limited it to 40 travellers at each camp so that people could enjoy this experience,” says Karishma Joshi of Mumbai Travellers. Campers could lounge by the lakeside, sit around a bonfire or explore nearby areas.
