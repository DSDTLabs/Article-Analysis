Mumbai: In order to introduce checks and balances in   works in the wake of the repairs  , the BMC has decided that only ‘milling and carpeting’ of potholed stretches in the city will be done from now, instead of digging, reconstructing and   roads. 

 Milling and carpeting is a process that involves scraping out the paved area of the road to be repaired and smoothening the surface again. In case total   and reconstruction are deemed necessary, the chief engineer, roads, must certify that there has been substantial activity on a particular stretch, requiring radical repair, additional civic chief Sanjay Deshmukh, who is in charge of roads, said. 
 
 The two phases of the BMC’s probe in the repairs scam that came to light in September 2015 revealed that   had done shoddy work on the city’s roads. One of the main complaints of citizens and activists has been that a huge amount of tax-payers’ money is spent on repairing the same roads over and over again. Mumbai has a total of 1,941 km of roads. 
 
 A senior civic official said during the probe they found that contractors were not repairing the base layer but only the top surface.
 
  “The milling and carpeting process will bring down the cost of repairs substantially,” said the official.
 
 The BMC recently floated tenders for milling and carpeting of roads worth Rs 69 crore. Work on these stretches has already begun. The civic body plans to soon table a proposal before the civic standing committee for similar works worth Rs 282 crore. “All paver block roads which need to be repaired and reconstructed will now be repaired through milling and carpeting only. The defect liability period in case of roads repaired in this manner will be two years,” said Deshmukh.
 
 Sion-based activist G R Vora said, “It’s important that road engineers and politicos are made accountable, only then will the situation of road repair works in the city change.”
