' ' starring the supremely talented 'Mental Madhilo' actor   and Satna Titus released today amidst high expectations. And why wouldn't there be high expectations, seeing as how the film has been called "important" by   after he caught a special screening of it recently. 

 Directed by debutant   and featuring music by Suresh Bobbili, the film charts the journey of Sagar (Sree Vishnu) and the struggles he faces when it comes to his education. His father, coming under the pressure of society, expects Sagar to be everything he's not. Sagar on the other hand is a carefree happy-go-lucky guy who keeps failing his exams and likes to spend his time playing cricket with his friends. When he does something silly without thinking of the consequences, despite the anger, his father responds with love. This brings a sea of change in him wanting to be a better person for his father, with the help of a studious girl   (Satna Titus). But what happens when he crumbles under the weight of expectations? 
 
 The first half of the film sees Sree Vishnu deliver a stupendous performance as a student torn between who he is as a person and who his father wants him to be. Satna Titus is good enough in her role as the studious Dharmika who introduces Sagar to a motivational speaker played by Posani Krishna Murali. 'Needi Naadi Oke Katha' is a film that will not bear you down with useless information or get preachy, despite the subject it handles. So far, the film has been an engaging one and its only one song that seemed clich√©d and unnecessary to the proceedings. It remains to be seen how the second half will fare.
