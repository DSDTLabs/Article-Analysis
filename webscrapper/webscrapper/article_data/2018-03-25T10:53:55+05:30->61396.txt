CHENNAI:   champions   (CFC) will be without their captain and central defender   in the  .

 
 Sources close to the development said that it was Sereno who didn’t want to return for the tournament despite having a contract till May. Apart from Sereno, midfielder Rene Mihelic, right-back Inigo Calderon and winger Gregory Nelson will also not be available for the John Gregory-coached side. Unlike the  , where a side could register eight foreigners and play five, only six could be registered for Super Cup. CFC have registered defender Mailson Alves, forward Jude Nworuh, midfielders Raphael Augusto and Jaime Gavilan for the competition.
 
 Chennaiyin open their campaign in the knock-out competition against Aizawl FC, who finished sixth in the I League.
 
 “Sereno has been away from his family for a long time. That’s why he didn’t even return with the squad to Chennai after winning the tournament. Super Cup is also a knockout tournament and he was not too keen on returning to play in just a few matches. Chennaiyin and Sereno are still in talks over whether to renew his contract for next season,” the source said.
 
 The former Portugal international had been one of the most successful foreign imports. While he won the title with ATK in his first season in 2016, he played a crucial part in CFC’s ISL triumph this season. “I was on the verge of renewing my ATK contract. But everything changed as ATK parted ways with Atletico Madrid and brought new coaching personnel. I felt that too much change is not good for a club. In the end, I was proven right. The Chennaiyin team had the right choice of foreigners. We had the best bench strength. It was well supplemented by young Indian players who were keen to learn and prove themselves. So everything came together,” Sereno told TOI from Portugal.
