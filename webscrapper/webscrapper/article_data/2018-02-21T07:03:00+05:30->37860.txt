Ludhiana: A lot of hue and cry has been raised over the construction of roads in different areas just a few days ahead of MC polls. While the ex-councillors inform TOI that work orders were issued earlier, the opposition candidates claim the work is being done to lure the voters. Meanwhile, the MC has denied starting the construction work as their bitumen plant is still closed.

 In ward number 58, laying of bitumen is going on. Ex-councillor Rajesh Jain Navkar, however, said that work order was issued some six months ago and only laying of bitumen was left. He said the work was incomplete due to cold conditions. He also said the roads are being constructed for public and “there is nothing wrong with it.”
 
 Meanwhile, his BJP counterpart, Rajiv Kalra informed the area residents that the road work has started after he intervened. Similarly, another complaint came from ward number 46 where tile work was going on in Pritam Nagar. Congress candidate Yuvraj Sidhu said work started at this time just to “attract the voters”. “I understand it’s for public welfare but the construction of road could have been done earlier too,” he said.
 
 However, ex-councillor and SAD candidate Harbhajan Dang said, “Work order was issued earlier. The tile work is being done now so we don’t violate the election code of conduct. Only two roads are left while other roads have been already built.”
 
 Meanwhile, when contacted MC Commissioner Jaskiran Singh said, “These were ongoing works so there was no poll code violation. But they have not started the bitumen plant yet due to cold conditions.” He said they will check the quality of work and if found unsatisfactory, then MC will impose a penalty on the contractors, who are constructing the roads.
