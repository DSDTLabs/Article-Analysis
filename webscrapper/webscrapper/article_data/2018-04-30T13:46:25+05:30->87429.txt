Parra: Claiming that they hardly generate any garbage, villagers at a gram sabha of the   panchayat on Sunday expressed opposition to the proposed garbage  .

 Parra panchayat has decided to charge Rs 500 as an annual garbage tax on all dwelling units in the village. When this was announced at the gram sabha, villagers pointed out that most of the houses are residential and that almost all their food waste is fed to dogs, cats, cattle and other animals, while all the dry waste like newspapers, plastic, etc, is sold off to scrap agents. As a result, they hardly generate any garbage.
 
 Villagers also opposed a move to acquire land for a garbage treatment facility. Sarpanch Delilah Lobo said the panchayat has decided to acquire land for a garbage segregation station. 
 
 However, villagers voiced their opposition to this proposal, pointing out that all the garbage from Parra is already being sent to the garbage treatment plant at the   plateau.
