KOHIMA: President of the ruling Naga People's Front ( )   on Wednesday said the assembly election is set to be a fight against outside external forces. 

 "The 2018 election is not just a contest between political parties, but one between outside forces and the Naga people," Liezietsu said here at the kick-off rally for the NPF Kohima division, attended by five NPF candidates from the division - Keneizhakho Nakhro, Tseilhoutuo Rhutso, Khriehu Liezietsu, Khrielezo Bio and Kropol Vistu. Unlike other elections, he added, the 2018 election is a choice between the 'destruction or preservation' of the Naga people and their identity.
 
 He accused the Neiphiu Rio-led National Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) of acting for their own interests, evident when they offered 20 seats to BJP and invited it to entrench its roots in the state.
 
 "The present politics is beyond politics and that Naga people can clearly see that BJP, shouldering with some selfish Naga leaders, is penetrating into our land. Naga people should realise that this is not just politics but something else where we might lose our identity and faith one day," the NPF president said.
 
 NPF is contesting 58 seats, NDPP 40, BJP 20, NPP 25, Congress 18, JD (U) 13, NCP six, AAP three and LJP two seats, besides 11 Independents.
