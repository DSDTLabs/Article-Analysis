LUCKNOW: Several streets of Lucknow resembled a dump of disposable glasses and plates throughout Tuesday even as people gathered around bhandaras. 

 Since most bhandaras are not registered with  , no cleanliness activity was initiated by it. Very few stalls had enough dustbins or volunteers to guide people regarding waste. As a result, the city's roads were soon covered with plastic. 
 
 Engineering College crossing and Kapoorthala crossing were so heavily laden with waste that there was barely any space for traffic. With waste spilling to the middle of the road, stray animals were drawn towards it, resulting in obstruction in traffic. 
 
 Prime arteries like Ashok Marg and   and VIP areas like   also saw poorly managed stalls at regular intervals. The waste was thrown on the ground and neither the organisers nor   arranged for sweepers or regular cleaning.
 
 Anubhav Rastogi, a commuter, said, "I parked my bike on   in the morning and by evening, the spot was fully littered. There was no place to even stand because of the spilled waste all over. Even the parking space was not spared."
 
  The bhandara at Ram-Ram Bank crossing was surrounded by so many disposable glasses and plates and waste that people had to struggle to find a place to stand.
