The mercury keeps dipping at   and the city continues to shiver.   might sound lovely and romantic to those who can sit at home enjoying hot beverages wrapped up in fur blankets. However, it’s definitely taking toll on poor and destitute people of the city. Keeping the troubles of underprivileged in mind, a few city youngsters have taken an initiative to provide them warmth.

  “People always talk about moral responsibility towards society, but seldom has anyone taken any concrete action. We wanted to change that, therefore, our group decided to provide warm clothes and blankets to people living on street to make this harsh winter bearable for them,” says  , a volunteer and a student of NBT Law College.
 
  Abhijeet’s group include six more volunteers. “We are from different colleges but we reside in same area that is Tidke Colony. One day all of us were discussing what can be a good social activity and our brainstorming resulted into this initiative,” informs Saurabh Sonawane, a student and a budding artist. These young volunteers generated awareness using social media platforms and also appealed Nashikites to donate sweaters, blankets, quilt and other winter wears.
 
  “Fortunately, we received good response. Since then, we have been donating winter wears and blankets in areas like  ,   and Dwarka,” informs Abhijit.
