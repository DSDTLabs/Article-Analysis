AHMEDABAD: The Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) between Delhi and Mumbai will spur changes in passenger facilities at   and Unjha railway stations. Unjha station will be shifted 2km towards Ahmedabad, while Mehsana station will be shifted from the western side to the eastern side. Officials said the DFC will pass through the western side of Mehsana station, which has made the move necessary.

 Unjha station will be required for DFC facilities and the authorities have decided to shift the entire station to another area. The officials said that work on the DFC is in full swing and the earth work is nearing completion. Once the earth work is done, the laying of the track will begin.
 
 For quick movement of goods trains and to ease congestion at   railway station, the Ahmedabad division has got approval to lay an exclusive line for goods trains from   to Sanand. Officials said 145 trains pass through or originate from Kalupur station every day. To give priority to passenger trains, goods trains are made to wait in the yard. The exclusive goods line will take trains directly to Sanand from where they will be connected to the DFC line and head towards Delhi. Goods trains heading to   will be connected on the   line from Sanand.
