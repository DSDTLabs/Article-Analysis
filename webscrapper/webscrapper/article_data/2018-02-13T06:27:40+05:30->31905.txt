BENGALURU: The ropeway to  , a project that has remained a mirage for the past 32 years after it was proposed by actor  , seems to be making some slow moves. The latest is the government's decision to appoint a transaction adviser (TA) for the project. 

 Tourism minister   said the project is in the preliminary stage of scrutinising the bids to select TA for the project and it would be completed soon. 
 
 But given the snail's pace at which the project is progressing and the present Congress government hardly left with a month before the announcement of the assembly elections, it is unlikely the project will take wing and works will start anytime soon. The delay pertaining to the ropeway project had come up for discussion in the recently concluded legislature session and Kharge had said a detailed project report (DPR) has been prepared at a cost of Rs 94.33 crore by a private company. 
 
 "The ropeway project has been planned to be executed under the public-private-partnership ( ) model and after preparing the DPR, we are in the process of scrutinising the bids for selecting a transaction adviser," Kharge said. 
 
 After selecting TA who would draw up the roadmap for implementation of project, tenders have to be called to select the PPP concessionaire to develop the ropeway and maintain it. As the process takes several bureaucratic steps, it would be impractical to hope for works to take off during the present regime.
 
  
 
  In his budget speech for 2015-16, chief minister   had announced the cable car project for Nandi Hills, following which a land parcel of nine acres at the foot of the hills was sanctioned. Priyank Kharge, however, said land required for the project on top of the hills is yet to be sanctioned.
