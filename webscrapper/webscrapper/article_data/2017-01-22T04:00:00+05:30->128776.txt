Ahmedabad: City police investigating robbery of Rs9.42 lakh from a residence in Vastrapur have tracked down two auto-rickshaws used in the incident but the auto drivers were found to be innocent. Police have started search in slum areas of the city as a team will visit Rajasthan soon in search of the accused.

 On Friday, Rashmi Gupta, a resident of Century Tower in Bodakdev, was tied by a husband-wife duo working as domestic helps at her residence and an unidentified youth at 12.15pm. The trio then robbed cash, ornaments and other valuables from the residence and escaped from the spot. Police had found CCTV footage of the duo. “Two autos, found to be used in the incidents, were tracked down. We got to know that the duo had left the autos near Satellite police station. It is possible that the phone number that was with the victim might have been procured recently,” said an official. tnn
