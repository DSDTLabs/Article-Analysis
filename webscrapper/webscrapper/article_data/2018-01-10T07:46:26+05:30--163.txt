LUCKNOW: The indefinite strike by   employees has hit annual examination preparations. Demanding regularization, university employees continued the strike for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, affecting examination work and teaching. 

 While the last date for submitting the examination forms is Wednesday, students who came to the university to submit their forms had to return empty-handed as dean offices were shut due to the strike.
 
 "The last date for form submission is Wednesday. If a student fails to submit it, a late fee will have to be paid. The deadline for that is January 13," said BA student  . "Why should a student suffer or pay late fee if the office is shut due to strike," he added.
 
 "No one is available in the departments or offices. The university has marksheets online and examination form is also online but we are still asked to submit the photocopy of the marksheet with the form manually... What is the use of such an online system?" said  .
 
 BSc student   said practical examination was close but project files and assignment work was yet to be submitted.
 
 "Our time is being wasted. Employees are on strike not teachers but faculty is failing to turn up," said student Anil.
 
 Meanwhile, LU stuck to its decision of not fulfilling the regularization demand as the university is facing a financial crisis. "The university is facing a financial crunch. It can work with 33% employees, others should be transferred by the government to other institutes," said LU VC SP Singh.
