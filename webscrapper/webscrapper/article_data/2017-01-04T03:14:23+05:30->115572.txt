GREATER NOIDA: Pamphlets have started coming up at toll plazas along the   warning commuters against so-called ‘axle gangs’.

 The cautionary notices in Hindi put up by the   police warn the commuters on the robbers’ modus operandi, which is to stop a car by throwing a metallic object like an axle, rods, etc, and then rob its occupants when the vehicle comes to a halt.
 
 In cases such as the Bulandshahr gang rape in July and the   of jewellery worth about Rs 20 lakh from a family travelling on the Yamuna expressway on December 26, assailants had first distracted the driver of the vehicle by throwing a metallic rod on the vehicle.
 
 According to the police, members of these gangs are tribesmen from the Rajasthani tribes.
 
 SP (rural area) Sujata Singh told TOI that the pamphlets warn commuters about any noise emanating from near the vehicle, especially during odd hours. “If the commuters sense that their vehicle has suffered a tyre burst or puncture, they should not stop immediately but keep on driving slowly. They can dial 100 and inform the police. We have also asked Jaypee group, which manages the expressway, to run a scroll with such a warning on the toll plaza display board,” Singh said.
 
 She said that after the December 26 incident, when a group of four armed robbers had looted jewellery from a family travelling from Kanpur to Delhi via the expressway, in the early hours, the police had sent a notice to the Jaypee group as its officials had failed to inform the Greater Noida police in time that the family was in need of help.
 
 “The family had told us that they had stopped a patrolling van of the Jaypee group and asked the patrollers for help. However, they refused to help saying that it was a police matter. The police was not informed about the incident. We have issued them a notice to them in this regard,” Singh said.
