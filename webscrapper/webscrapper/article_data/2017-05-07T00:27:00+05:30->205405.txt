Mangaluru: Yellow anacondas will soon be part of Pilikula Biological Park, making it the first park in the state to have them. 

 Dr Shivarama Karantha Pilikula Nisargadhama that manages the biological park has received approval from the Central Zoo Authority to rear these anacondas. The park authorities will bring two pairs of yellow anacondas to the zoo either from Crocodile Park in Chennai or from the National Zoological Gardens in Sri Lanka through an animal exchange programme. As the proposal is in implementation stage, it will take some time for these reptiles to arrive. 
 
 H Jayaprakash Bhandary, director, Pilikula Biological Park, told STOI that summer is not the right season to shift the animals from one place to another. Hence, the park will make arrangements to bring the anacondas soon after the onset of monsoon. “We have all the necessary infrastructure in place including enclosures to rear yellow anaconda,” he added. 
 
 The park spread across 82 hectares is the only zoo recognized as a breeding centre for King Cobras. It is also functioning as a rescue centre for wounded wild life. Also known as Pilikula Zoo, the centre has 400 animals, reptiles and birds and most of the species are breeding. 
 
 In accordance with prevailing laws, the Central Zoo Authority of India has recognized the park. As per modern zoological practices, the animal enclosures have been so designed that they resemble natural habitat. The park has a veterinary hospital with an operation theatre, diagnostic lab and other facilities like treatment squeezers, close observation cages and hand rearing facilities for young ones.
 
 Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens in Mysuru had brought green anacondas in 2011.
