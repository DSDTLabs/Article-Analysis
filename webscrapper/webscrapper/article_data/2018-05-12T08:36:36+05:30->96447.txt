JALPAIGURI: The defence ministry is looking to adopt tea garden worker Karimul Haque’s method of ferrying patients from remote villages to hospitals on his motorcycle.

 Ministry officials spoke to Karimul recently and sent  , a Defence Research and Development Organisation technical co-ordinator, to   on Tuesday to interact with the   awardee and study how he ferries patients from areas that lack communication and roads.
 
 “I told Sharma I have no technique. I just respond to calls. Most of the time, there is no road and I have to drive through forests, riverine areas and kutcha roads. But he insisted on staying with me. How could I turn him down?” Karimul said, smiling.
 
 Sources said ministry officials believe Karimul’s method will help ferry injured or sick jawans posted along borders to nearby hospitals without wasting time for ambulances to arrive.
 
 Karimul had seen his mother die in 1995 as there was no ambulance to rush her to hospital. For two decades since then, he has been ferrying patients on his motorcycle free of charge. No matter what time of day it is, he is available whenever summoned.
 
 A resident of Dhalabari in Kranti under   subdivision, Karimul also serves all nearby villages. Everybody there is dependent on him, especially during emergencies. The government acknowledged his work with a Padma Shri last year. 
 
 His life has drawn Bollywood’s attention and writer-director Vinay Mudgil has signed an agreement with him for a biopic titled ‘Ambulance Man’.
