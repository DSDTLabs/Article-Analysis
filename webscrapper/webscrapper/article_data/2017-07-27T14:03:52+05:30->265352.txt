CHANDIGARH:   and   called up Punjab chief minister   on Wednesday to condole the death of his mother Rajmata Mohinder Kaur. The President expressed his heartfelt sympathies with the Punjab CM, saying that his thoughts and prayers were with the family in their hour of grief.

 Kovind recalled his stay with the family in Moti Bagh Palace during his visit to Patiala, along with Morarji Desai in 1977. He remembered the pleasant hospitality offered to him by the Rajmata during their palace stay, a press statement issued by the chief minister’s office said. Despite being close to former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Rajmata Mohinder Kaur had chosen to side with the old guard led by Morarji Desai when the Congress split after the Emergency, it said. She chose to join the Janata Party and was appointed its general secretary. It was during that time, in 1977, when Kovind had visited Moti Bagh palace.
 
 The chief minister, while thanking President Kovind for his condolences, regretted that he could not attend the latter’s swearing in at the Rashtrapati Bhavan on Tuesday. Amarinder congratulated him on being elected to the high office of President.
