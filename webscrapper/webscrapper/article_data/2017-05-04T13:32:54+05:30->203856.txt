HYDERABAAD: It has been six months since the   took the nation by storm by announcing demonetization of `1,000 and `500, but ATMs across the city still continue to be dry with only 30 per cent of them having limited cash. 

 With the   (RBI) providing only onefourth of the total cash required by ATMs, most of them in the state are running dry.
 
 Last month was hard for citizens in Hyderabad as many were unable to withdraw their money from ATMs. “Since last month we have been told that the situation would improve, but it continues to be bad and we are forced to go to bank and withdraw money by standing in a queue,“  , a resident of   lamented.
 
 Curiously,   say that the situation has improved slightly but citizens are not aware of the timing when the cash is loaded into ATMs. “When there is no cash we display boards, but when we have cash we don't display boards, so people are not even turning up at ATMs,“ said a bank manager. “People are now used to digital transactions, so it doesn't worry them if there is cash or not in ATMs,“ he added.
 
 Some bank officials say that the cash position has not improved at all. “We require about '1 crore per week, but we are getting about '35 lakh from currency chests, and top officials have instructed us to give priority for the over-the-counter withdrawals rather than loading money into ATMs at present,“ manager of a public sector bank said.
