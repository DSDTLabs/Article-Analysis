MUMBAI: Rejecting discharge pleas of two moneylenders, the Bombay   has said that continuous verbal and physical abuse and repeated demand for return of money amounts to abetment of suicide.

 Justice AM Badar was recently hearing a petition filed by Gurunath Gawli and Sangita Gawli, both licensed moneylenders, seeking discharge from a case of abetment of suicide. The duo were accused of assaulting and intimidating Umesh Bomble, a city resident, and abetting his suicide in September 2014. His wife Sunita had filed a complaint against the duo.
 
 According to the prosecution, the victim had taken a   of Rs 19 lakh from the accused. When he failed to repay, the duo allegedly harassed him and on various occasions verbally abused and even assaulted him. “A prudent family man when meted with such treatment day in and day out would certainly think of committing suicide,” Justice Badar said.
 
 “The conduct of the accused persons in assaulting the deceased for getting unts to “instigation and provocation” to commit suicide.
 
 “Cornered to a wall by such behaviour of the accused, the victim Umesh was bound to think that it is better to die rather than suffer such humiliations in front of his children and other family members,” said Justice Badar while dismissing the discharge plea.
