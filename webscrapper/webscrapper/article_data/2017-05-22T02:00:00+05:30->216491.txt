PATNA:   MP from Uttar Pradesh (UP) and the party’s national Kisan Morcha president Birendra Singh Mast on Sunday countered the claim of RJD chief Lalu Prasad that he would “burn the Lanka” of PM Narendra Modi, saying that RJD chief’s bid to do it would actually result in the “destruction of his own Ayodhya” that he has built in Bihar.

 Mast was in Patna to elaborate all the “good works” done by the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre to benefit farmers in the country. “The Nitish Kumar government in Bihar has failed to implement the Centre’s pro-farmer policies because RJD is an obstacle,” Mast said.
 
 He added unlike the case in UP where the Yogi Adityanath government has started taking pro-farmer policies, caste politics in Bihar over a long period of time had resulted in the neglect of farmers.
 
 Five days ago, the UP government had announced to give Rs 1,500 per quintal subsidy to farmers producing compost fertilisers, Mast said, adding if Nitish also implemented the grant of subsidy, it would benefit farmers of Bihar. Mast reiterated that the “Lalu brand of politics” has harmed Bihar of which CM Nitish has also been a victim, as he is unable to implement the Centre’s agriculture policies, like the use of solar power to run pumping sets for irrigation purposes and also PM Sinchai Yojana, crop insurance scheme and organic farming.
 
 “Lalu and RJD supporters know only one thing – khaat lootenge, baat lootenge, haat lootenge aur thaat se rahenge. The RJD chief does not differentiate between public money and private money,” Mast said.
 
 Referring to Lalu’s challenge to the Centre to reveal the address of 22 locations raided by the income-tax department, Mast said, “If the locations are not owned by him, his family members and friends, they should become government property.”
