CHANDIGARH:   Police on Saturday registered a case of rape against two employees of a private school in   district after a girl student there sent a mail to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) as the school management did not act on her complaint. State police chief DGP B S   said a special Investigation team (SIT) had been constituted to probe the matter and the management of the school could also face action.

 According to the mail, the survivor, a minor, was sexually abused by two staffers at the school. In her mail, the girl said that she had informed her class in charge about the wrongdoings of the two accused. Even though she brought it to the knowledge of the principal and director of the school too, no action was taken and she continued to face the trauma, said a senior police officer.
 
 Sources said on Friday, she wrote to a mail to PMO and also marked the copies to Haryana chief minister’s office ( ) and the DGP. She had also threatened to commit suicide if the school director did not take up the matter at an appropriate platform. “According to mail, she has given two names and some clues about the mobile phone to be recovered. We will go to the depth of the case,” said Sandhu.
