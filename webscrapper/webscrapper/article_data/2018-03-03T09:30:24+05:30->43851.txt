CHENNAI: The Central Board of Secondary Education’s ( ) decision to exempt Class X board exam candidates from separate pass criteria for internal assessment and theory has come as a relief for students of the current batch who will be taking the first mandatory public exam in eight years.

 
 So far, students had to attain a minimum benchmark in each of the categories of internal assessment and theory. While they had to score 7 of 20 in internal assessment, they required 26 of 80 in theory to pass the exam. Now, however, in a one-time exemption for the current batch, students will be passed if they secure 33 marks on the overall 100.
 
 “This comes as a huge relief for many students. If they perform well at the school level in internal assessment and get full marks of 20, it ensures a pass as a basic minimum of 13 in theory can easily be scored by most students,” said  , advisor to the   complex.
 
 However, some academicians and teachers felt that schools may tend to award higher marks in internal assessment to push students toward an easier pass.
 
 “Schools should keep in mind that the same students should be able to cope with the higher standard in Class XI and XII and shouldn’t award marks just for the sake of it,” said  , a teacher in a CBSE school in the city.
 
 “The CBSE’s decision is logical but at the end of the day it comes down to schools following it in good faith and not awarding all students 20/ 20 to show better results for their institution. Somewhere, a check must be there,” said   of the Shreeniketan Group of Schools.
