THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Governor   on Saturday asked chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan 'to take immediate necessary action to put a curb on such disturbing incidents so as to send a positive signal to peace-loving citizens of the state'. Governor's directive was part of the forwarding note of the petition submitted to him by   leaders seeking his intervention to ensure justice to BJP-RSS workers who have been under threat of CPM cadres in Kannur. The petition was forwarded to CMO by the Raj Bhavan with the covering note. 

 The BJP delegation, led by MLA O Rajagopal demanded enactment of Armed Forces Special Powers Act in Kannur by declaring it as 'disturbed area' and deployment of army to bring the law and order situation back to normalcy. The BJP delegation alleged that CPM was responsible for the murder of an RSS functionary Biju in Payyannur, Kannur on Friday.
 
 The petition also stated that ever since the present government came to power, the Sangh Parivar had lost 14 of its core workers in nearly 500 attacks by the CPM and alleged that the state government was supporting the perpetrators of violence in Kannur.
 
 Meanwhile, the forwarding of the petition from Raj Bhavan to CMO was not received well by the BJP leaders. Criticizing the governor's act sharply, BJP general secretary   wrote on Facebook, "We approached the governor as we were sure that we wouldn't get justice (from the state government) as long as Pinarayi Vijayan is the CM. Do we need the governor as an agent to pass our petition to the CM. It is not because we don't know the address of CMO that we approached the governor. There are several steps which a Governor can initiate. Will he take any of those?"
 
 The BJP leadership has also apprised national president Amit Shah about the developments.
 
 Opposition Leader   who condemned the murder of Biju asked both the CPM and the BJP put down weapons. hala.
