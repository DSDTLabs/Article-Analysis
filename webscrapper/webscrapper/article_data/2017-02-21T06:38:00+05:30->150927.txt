NAGPUR: In the news for brazen encroachment and extraction of murrum last month, the   near Godhani violated law of land by digging 300m-long trench illegally on   (CR) land.

 The violations were pointed out by an alert resident of the area,  , after which the Nagpur division of CR swung into action and stopped the work.
 
 Sisodia said that the digging work started since morning for some cable laying work. No prior permission was taken from the railways. A 1.5m-deep trench has been dug, one kilometre from the school on Godhani roadside.
 
 The   (RPF) reached the spot around 3pm and stopped the work. After seeing the railway police, the three JCB machines at work were immediately parked inside the military school and police failed to seize them.
 
 “We have registered an FIR at the Koradi police station and stopped the work,” said PRO PD Patil.
 
 Senior railway engineering department officials confirmed that it is a criminal offence and also violation of the Railways Act.
 
 “We give permission in such cases and the school should have approached us systematically with a proposal. We own 144 acres on the roadside since 1913 and have valid documents,” the officials said.
 
 On January 23, TOI was first to report how the school, run by   (CHES), was started about 20 years ago with an aim to inculcate patriotism and discipline among children. However, it has itself taken law in its hand it seems.
