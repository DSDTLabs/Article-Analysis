NAVI MUMBAI: The Navi Mumbai civic body has started supplying 5MLD water to   to meet the   node requirement. 

  Earlier a delegation of   City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) corporators met Cidco officials and asked them to seek the help of   to tide over the water crisis in Kharghar.
 
 A Cidco superintending engineer said, “NMMC was requested to supply 5 MLD water to our Kharghar node. Accordingly, the NMMC has agreed and have been supplying water for more than a week now .”
 
 A   node water supply engineer said, “The NMMC water pipeline has a connection point at sector 11 in Kharghar. From this point, water can be supplied to Kharghar residents. Hence the water woes of the node have been resolved.”
 
 PCMC water supply committee president   said, “Nine PCMC corporators from the Kharghar node had a meeting with the Cidco joint MD, Rajendra Chavan on April 27, 2018. The joint MD has assured us that he would request NMMC to supply 5 MLD water. Finally, the node has received more water. The complaints pertaining to water supply has been nullified.” 
 
 Kharghar Sector 15 resident Santosh Sonkamble said, “Earlier we were facing water scarcity but it has been resolved. The crisis was the worst in sector 21.” 
 
 Around 200 residents from affected sectors 2, 3, 4, 5,7,11,12 and 21 had complained to their elected representative about water woes. 
 
 This has forced the politicos to look into their demand. Also the dysfunctional pump at the hill storage reservoir in sector 5 added to the woes, but it has become operational, said Cidco sources. 
 
 Panvel has been badly affected by water scarcity especially after Dehrang dam dried up. Various areas under the Panvel civic jurisdiction are still facing water problems. Many housing societies in Kharghar, Kamothe and surrounding areas had to bank on private water tankers to fulfil their water requirements. 
 
 Kharghar , the fast developing node in Panvel, was facing a deficit of around 10 MLD in supply.
