MUMBAI: For the last week, four   have been squatting at the gates of Goregaon’s Bombay Veterinary College. They were donated by an   to the   in  , but couldn’t be transported to the   without permission from the college authorities since the pada is located on their campus.

 On Wednesday, 270 tribals took out a morcha to free the toilets from the college authorities’ red tape. “In the past, we have struggled for our land, water and fundamental rights, but this is the first time we’ve ever had to protest for toilets,” said Prakash Bhoir, who was leading the protest. Tribals often fall prey to leopards when they venture out at night to answer nature’s call.
 
 
 By the afternoon, their demonstration had caught the attention of the authorities and eventually a compromise was reached wherein the residents could take the toilets home but not use them for a few days. “We should give them permission for toilets but first I need to take the permission of higher authorities at the Veterinary University in Nagpur,” said Associate Dean PL Dhande. Allowing them to carry the portable toilets into the pada premises, he added, was a “risky” step, which he had only allowed on compassionate grounds.
 
 Besides toilets, the tribals were also protesting the lack of basic amenities like electricity and water. However, the college authorities are less inclined to accede to these demands as they want the government to shift the pada to another location.
