PHAGWARA: The Congress candidate from Phagwara,   Mann, has written to the chief electoral officer (CEO) of Punjab, V K Singh, over an SHO roughing up the wife of BJP worker   and taking her and her two minor children to a police station at night without any women cops.

 In his letter, Mann has urged the CEO “to reign in Phagwara police”, claiming that its officials were acting as “stooges” of the ruling SAD-BJP alliance even though the model code of conduct was in force already.
 
 Mann has named Phagwara City SHO Nirmal Singh and Satnampura SHO Sulakhan Singh in the letter. Chadha has been named as an accused in a case of assault on BJP leader Ashok Duggal. Nirmal, who is an inspector by rank, had gone to Chadha’s house on Friday night to arrest him. However, on not finding Chadha there, he had roughed up his wife, Monica, and taken her to the police station, it has been alleged. 
 
 He had also forced her two minor children to accompany him. Nirmal Singh has since been shunted to police lines. Area residents have already demanded Nirmal Singh’s suspension and registration of a case against him. “The motive behind this entire unlawful move is to terrorize people who had voted freely against the highhandedness of police and ruling alliance during the polls; it is a sheer violation of the model code of conduct,” he said.
 
 He pointed out that during the enforcement of model code of conduct, the CEO was the custodian of rule of law. The issue has already brought Congress and a section of BJP on the same page. Already, two cases have been registered against two sides of BJP leaders and there has been no end to bitterness within BJP after polling.
