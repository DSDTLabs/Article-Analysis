LUCKNOW: A three-year- old   was seriously injured when he bumped into a battery operated   in   on Sunday. The boy, Ali Alam, who came to the zoo with his family, was strolling in front of the museum when the accident occurred. 

 The boy bled profusely and his forehead, skull and nose were injured. He was immediately rushed to Civil hospital. Zoo director Anupam Gupta said it was an accident. He said the vehicle was moving at its usual slow speed when the kid ran towards it and got hit. “We expressed apologies to the family. A few workers from the zoo also accompanied them to the hospital. Though the incident was sad, I believe it happened because such a small child was left unattended,” he said.
 
 Ali is the son of Shanu Alam, a corporator of Deva in Barabanki. Ali’s paternal uncle Shibbu said, “It is important to take precautions at public places, especially if kids are around.”
