LUCKNOW: The city’s cyber cell transferred the several cases of card-cloning reported recently to STF (special task force) on Monday. The move was taken after 75 complaints lodged at the cyber cell since the last week of March.

 Cyber Cell sub-inspector V S Sirohi said two fresh complaints were received on Monday, including one from   area of a Rs 25,000 fraud and another from   of Rs 7,000 being withdrawn fraudulently from ATM. “The cyber thieves seem to have fixed   in some   of the city to retrieve data from the bank debit cards,” he told TOI. Mostly, ATMs of government banks have been targeted for card cloning so far, Sirohi added.
 
 One complaint of ATM cloning came from a government bank. Sirohi said more than Rs 10 lakh had been stolen through card cloning so far. Earlier, seven cases of card-cloning were reported on Friday and Saturday.
