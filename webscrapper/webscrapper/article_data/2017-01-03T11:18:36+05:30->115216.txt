COIMBATORE: Students of a corporation school became mascots of change after the civic body implemented the changes they suggested on Puliyakulam road. The students had submitted a proposal regarding cleanliness, road maintenance, cable maintenance and street lights on the 250m stretch on Puliyakulam road, as part of a national level civic festival organized by an NGO. The public toilet that was usually an eye-sore, stinky and unhygienic has been renovated, painted and cleaned. 

 "We have cleared the garbage in the area and renovated the public toilet. We have also begun clearing the drains to ensure there is no clogging. We will remove encroachments in the area and set up boards very soon," said a corporation officer. 
 
 The students, who were ecstatic at these changes, said they were very happy that they could bring about positive change. The civic body plans to remove encroachments on the road on Tuesday. 
 
 "The officials also plan to set up 'school zone' warning boards, a bus shelter and implement a zebra crossing on the road. We are thrilled that our suggestions are being implemented," said one of the students.
 
 Each team was asked to select a 250m stretch, list out the issues in the area and come up with   to solve them. The girls selected the road from   to   at Puliyakulam. 
 
 "They conducted a survey of the area and also interacted with people. They gave a presentation to the corporation commissioner," said   and the team's mentor. The team will soon leave for Bengaluru where they will take part in a national festival, representing the south zone.
