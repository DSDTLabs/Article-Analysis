Visakhapatnam: Anantapur TDP MP JC Diwakar Reddy opined that if the MLAs and MPs strived hard to generate awareness about the government welfare schemes and bring them to the doorsteps of the public, then TDP would retain its power in 2019 elections.

 Drawing a metaphor from the anatomy, he said MLAs and MPs are like hands and legs of a human being, while the CM’s welfare schemes was the body. If the hands and legs coordinated well, the body would remain balanced on the ground. All public representatives should focus on this issue, he urged.
 
 Commenting on opposition leader and YSRCP chief Jagan’s meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the MP said it would not have any impact on the TDP. “TDP’s position is better. There will not be any problem if Jagan meets PM or any politician. TDP would come to power once again in 2019,” he said.
