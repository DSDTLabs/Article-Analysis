PUNE: Old habits die hard. For a country used to paying for everything from   and even  , its increasing availability at banks and ATMs after months of shortage, besides the   levied on  , has pushed people back to preferring the   over plastic ones.

 Many customers said cash payments are easier and more convenient, especially for small transactions of a few hundred rupees or so. While paying online or with cards, they say, they end up spending more because of the transaction charges.
 
 They added that to save this unnecessary transaction fee or service charge levied on digital payments, they’d rather use cards only for bigger transactions. 
 
 The surcharge being levied by shopkeepers on card transactions is unfair, said Nitin Deshmukh, a resident of Baner Pashan Link Road, who prefers to do smaller purchases with cash. “Many shopkeepers charge extra if we pay using a card. This is unfair as that cost has to be borne by shopkeepers,” he said.
 
 Dipika Nagpal, who paid in cash for a dress she bought on the street, said, “I have been able to withdraw money easily from the ATM and am using it for all kinds of purchases. I did not want to go through the process of loading my e-wallet. Most shopkeepers, especially hawkers, prefer cash and have already ditched their e-wallets.”
 
 Another customer, Ritesh Mishra, said, “I have enough cash with me now, so don’t mind spending it. Shopkeepers also willingly give change now. Sometimes, I pay in cash just to get change for a Rs 2,000 note and end up getting enough Rs 100 notes to make my other transactions easier.”
 
 Demanding a proper bill for the transaction ensures the money doesn’t go unaccounted for, said Ashish Abhyankar, another citizen who is using cash increasingly. “For every purchase, big or small, I demand a bill. Sometimes, chemist shops try to pass off a ‘kuccha bill’ for a cash transaction, but I insist on a proper printed bill. This ensures the cash doesn’t go into the shopkeeper’s pocket,” he said.
