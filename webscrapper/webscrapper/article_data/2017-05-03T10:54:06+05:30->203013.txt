Actress   who got engaged to her fiancé Naveen in March this year, is all set for an October wedding. The actress is currently shooting in Scotland for her film  , so her mother Pushpa confirmed the news. 

 “The wedding is fixed for 
 , and it will be held at Thrissur, our native place. It’s going to be a simple one, not a grand celebrity wedding or anything,” she says. “We will be inviting our close relatives, friends and neighbours, but will be selective.” On whether the film industry will be present, she says, “Her close friends will be invited but Bhavana will decide all that. She will be back from Scotland by the end of May. Her brother also needs to make some time to discuss things.” However, there won’t be any function in Kochi as reported in certain portals, she adds.
 
 Bhavana met Naveen, a Kannada film producer and actor, at the set of a film five years ago. Though the couple had decided to get married two years back, Bhavana’s father passed away unexpectedly, and later, Naveen’s mother, because of which the dates got pushed.
 
 The actress plays the lead in Prithviraj-starrer Adam Joan, and has Adventures of Omanakuttan coming up in Malayalam.
