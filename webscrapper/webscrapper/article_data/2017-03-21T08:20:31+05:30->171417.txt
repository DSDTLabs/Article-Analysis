ALLAHABAD: Students preparing for competitive examinations on Monday demanded the new chief minister to initiate probe into the examinations conducted by   (UPPSC) during 2013-16. 

 The aspirants claimed that deputy chief minister   and cabinet minister   have, from time to time, supported the students' movement by taking part in the agitation held by them.
 
 Aspirants led by Kaushal Singh and  , in the letter, demanded   enquiry into all the recruitment exams conducted by the UPPSC from 2013 till 2016.
 
 "There is lack of transparency in the functioning of the exam conducting body. Several members, in the past, have been recruited in an unconstitutional manner. This needs to be probed," said Kaushal.
