CHANDIGARH: Staging one of  's famous plays `The Lower Depths' requires a lot of courage and ideation.However, artiste Chakresh   took the plunge and staged the adaptation of the popular play and highlighted the plight of the marginalised people of the society. Titled Rodent, the members of the   group put up a great performance at Mini Theater, Sector 18, Chandigarh.

 Speaking to TOI, Chakresh Kumar, the director of the play said, “In the original version, Gorky tried to weave a narrative around those who have given up on life especially the recently-released prisoners and the ostracized masses of the society. In my play , you will find similar characters but I have just placed them in a gas chamber where different kind of experiments are being done on their bodies, but anonymously .Hitler tried to suffocate thousands of Jews in the gas chambers of the concentration camps. In the same way , I am trying to portray that the entire world is slowly turning into a gas chamber.“
 
 The director has also tried to analyse this group of people as normal human beings who also have dreams and hopes, even though they have been robbed of their dignity and have become `rats in a laboratory'. “They have been emotion ally and mentally scarred and their bodies are being used in various ways to send medicines to villages.“
 
 The 50-minute play brings to the fore the different layers of a superior and inferior life and how the entire world follows this mechanism. “The bodies of the characters have been used to put forward their inner turmoil,“ Kumar said.
