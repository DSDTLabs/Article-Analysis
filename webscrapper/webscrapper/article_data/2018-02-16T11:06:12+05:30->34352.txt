CHANDIGARH: Falling in the list of areas affected by civic apathy, the light poles and bollard lights inside the park next to the Children's Traffic Park, in Sector 23 are in a terrible condition to say the least. 

 The park, which is located almost parallel to the   dividing road, has at least two light poles which are devoid of light bulbs, thus rendering them completely useless. They have merely been contributing to the vandalised look of the surroundings. 
 
 At the same time, among a few bollard light points, situated inside the park, one of them was found to be broken and fallen to the ground, and had no tubelights attached. The bollard lights, which appear to be forcefully pulled out, also had exposed electrical wires, peeping out of its circular base. "I think these light poles and this smaller light point have remained in this status for a very long time. At nights, the park has minimal lighting making it very dark. Despite this, nobody has ever taken the initiative of getting the broken lights repaired," said Himanshu, a nearby resident and a regular jogger in the park. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Baldev Singh, a senior citizen said, "This bollard light point doesn't seem to have fallen on its own. This definitely has been damaged intentionally and probably even the tubelight has been stolen from inside."
 
 When asked further, numerous passers-by and park goers said school-kids and some anti-social elements generally inhabit the the park at all sorts of odd hours of the day and also indulge in damaging public property. "This park is rather neglected as all the attention is usually diverted to the Children's Traffic Park. Moreover, all kinds of anti-social elements inhabit this park all day and none of them are penalised in any way and hence damage to public property in the park can be expected," said Akanksha, a nearby resident.
