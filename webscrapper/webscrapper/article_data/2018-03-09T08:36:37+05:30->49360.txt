SURAT: Bardoli Urban Development Authority (Buda) can now issue permission for development works in   area. This recent decision of the state government, by changing the structure of Buda, has paved way for new development works in Bardoli.

 Buda, after inception on December 9, 2015, had begun development works in 34 villages spread over 148.92 sq km area under its limits, having a population of 1.5 lakh. However, in 2016, a total of 18 villages were excluded from Buda leaving only 16 villages and Bardoli town under the body. This had virtually stopped development works in Bardoli town spread over 7.36 sq km area with a population of 60,148. 
 
 Also, after Buda was formed, Bardoli Nagarpalika had stopped meetings of its development council, a body formed to issue permissions for development works. 
 
 Earlier, the council used to meet 4-5 times a year and issue permissions for development works. However, no new permissions were issued in last two years. As a result, large number of unplanned and unauthorized development had taken place in Bardoli.
 
 Iswar Parmar, state minister and Bardoli MLA, instrumental in getting this done, told TOI, “When Suda was formed,   (SMC ) got the right to give development permissions. Similarly, Bardoli was also given that facility for rapid growth of the town.”
