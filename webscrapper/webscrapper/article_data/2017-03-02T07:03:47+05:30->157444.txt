Ahmedabad:   on Wednesday asked the state government to frame guidelines to curb undertrial prisoners escaping police custody in transit.

 The HC also suggested that the government put in place proper classification of cases so that undertrial prisoners can be treated accordingly to avert such instances.
 
 The high court sought a detailed report on such incidents and action taken against the policemen responsible, who were part of the escort party. The matter shall be heard further on March 15.
 
 This came while hearing a PIL filed by   of “Jaagte Raho Party”, who sought strict action against police officials in cases of prisoners escaping. He alleged these incidents occur with the collusion of policemen.
 
 Desai also claimed that 124 undertrial prisoners had fled police custody during transit. Escapes take place when a prisoner is allowed to go to the toilet or from court and hospital campuses. He said there are some policemen facing departmental action and some have been suspended.
 
 Desai said while the suspension is invariably revoked, the cops get just a slap on the wrist in the form of a blocked increment and small fine. Desai demanded reforms and a punishment mechanism to curb such instances.
 
 Desai placed before the court details furnished by the state home department in response to his   applications. The information covered the last three years. The report showed that 122 errant policemen had received mild punishments – a penalty of up to Rs 3,500, suspension and immediate reinstatement. All of them were taken back into service before their punishment was finalized.
