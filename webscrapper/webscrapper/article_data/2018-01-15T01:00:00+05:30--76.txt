As Indians, we associate the belan with the round rotis on our plates. Re-evaluating this theory is Colors’ ' ' that brings to life how an ordinary item like a belan changes the life of a mismatched couple,   (Krystle D’souza) and Amarnath ( ). Goofy yet loving, Roopa has all the makings of an ideal bahu, but her clumsiness spells only trouble. Her unhappy husband, Amarnath dies after being hit on the head by his wife with the belan. The story goes forward when he returns to haunt her as a ghost, albeit comically. Supported by a seemingly dysfunctional family, this laughter riot promises to add to your entertainment-diet. The comic capers of the Awasthi family will come to life tonight and will air every Monday to Friday at 10.30 pm on Colors. 

 Actress Krystle D’souza is excited about her role. She says, “The humble belan can be used as a mighty weapon. It can be a cautionary tool. Yes, it’s all bark and no bite, but you can effectively use it to sound off someone. You can use it to fly kites and also in arts and crafts, where you can bring your creativity to light.”
 
 'Belan Waali Bahu' is a comic-drama that gives viewers a peek into human impulses and tendencies that also stars Sudhir Pandey, Bhavana Balsavar, Mushtaq Khan, Sikandar Kharbanda, Parijat, Shraddha Jaiswal and Sunayana Fozdar.
