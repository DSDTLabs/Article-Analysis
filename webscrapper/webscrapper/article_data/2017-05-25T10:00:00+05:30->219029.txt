A large analysis of current research shows that people who eat at least 20 grams of nuts a day have a lower risk of  .

 The analysis of all current studies on   and disease risk has revealed that 20 gram a day equivalent to a handful - can cut people's risk of coronary heart disease by nearly 30 percent.
 
 The study included all kinds of tree nuts, such as hazel nuts and walnuts, and also peanuts - which are actually legumes. The research team analyzed 29 published studies from around the world that involved up to 819,000 participants, including more than 12,000 cases of coronary heart disease, 9,000 cases of stroke. 18,000 cases of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and more than 85,000 deaths. While there was some variation between the populations that were studied, such as between men and women, people living in different regions, or people with different risk factors, the researchers found that nut consumption was associated with a reduction in disease risk across most of them.
 
 What makes nuts so potentially beneficial is their nutritional value. Nuts and peanuts are high in fiber, magnesium, and polyunsaturated fats - nutrients that are beneficial for cutting cardiovascular disease risk and which can reduce cholesterol levels.
