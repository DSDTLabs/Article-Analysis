MUMBAI: Five teenagers, aged between 13 and 16, escaped from the   children's remand home on Saturday. The Dongri police have started the search operation. 

  "They are runaway children and were brought to the remand home by an NGO. These children have escaped from the remand home," said deputy police commissioner  . 
 
 "Since the   department (PWD) is busy with some construction work at the remand home, there was a ladder next to the outer portion of the remand home's wall. These children climbed out using the ladder. No official from the remand home has come forward with a complaint to the police," added Sharma. 
 
 Investiga tors are also going through   footage to ascertain how the children ran away. In March 2013, more than 30 CCTV cameras were installed at the remand home. In the past several inmates tried to flee but were later captured. The remand homehouses 240 girls and boys. tnn
