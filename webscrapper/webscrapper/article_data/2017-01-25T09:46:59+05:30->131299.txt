KOCHI: Liquor stores are often demonised as dens of `antisocial' elements by people in the neighbourhood, but two premium outlets located at Gandhi Nagar in Kochi have found a way to co-exist with residents of the locality.

 “There were three stores here - one regular and two premium ones, but a year ago they closed down the regular one.The menace caused by long lines have now come to an end,“ said Vijaykumar B, president of the  .
 
 Currently in Gandhi Nagar, there are two functional alcohol stores, one run by Kerala State Co-operatives Consumers' Federation Ltd and other by  , both premium stores.
 
 “We know that complaints from locals will considerably reduce if the customers are provided in-store access, so in order to relocate our stores we are looking for plots that can accommodate both premium stores as well as the regular stores, but as of now in the Aluva region we have not found a location yet,“ said AV Pradip, Bevco regional manager.
 
 “It's not that we have never had problems with tipplers in this area but since the regular store's shut down, no major incidents have happened,“ said local councillor, Poornima Narayan.
 
 In 2015 local residents had staged a protest and tippler etiquette has shown signs of improvement since then, she said.But not all problems have ceased to exist. “After office hours many visit these stores and most of the time they park the cars outside creating traffic congestion,“ said Vijaykumar.
 
 Trouble by `anti-social' tipplers in the area has considerably reduced, ever since regular store ceased operations.
 
 “We cannot make the normal stores into premium stores due to pilferage. The premium stores, though they are being monitored by   cameras, people still find a way to nick a bottle or two,“ said A V Pradip.
