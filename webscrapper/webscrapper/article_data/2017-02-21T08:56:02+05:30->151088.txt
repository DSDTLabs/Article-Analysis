THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Veteran CPM leader and chairman of the administrative reforms commission   said on Monday that the politicians, who deliver long speeches, do not take action against people involved in corruption, once they come into power.
He was inaugurating a seminar on `Corruption and  : Need for Transparency' organized by the Government Law College and Indian Institute of Public Administration here.
 
 “Political leaders are responsible to take action against corrupt employees,“ said Achuthanandan.
 
 Talking about corruption among government employees, he said: “The main responsibility of a government employee is to provide corruption free services to the public. Government employees are termed as government servants in the Constitution. Corruption can be solved to an extent when these officials realise that they are the servants of the public.“
 
 Citing the palm oil case and titanium case, he said century old corruption cases are going nowhere and are transferred from courts to courts. “Owning assets illegally is corruption.Now, Sasikala has been sentenced in such a case. Even after the death of the main accused, there is no end to the case,“ said the CPM leader.
 
 Meanwhile, chief information commissioner Vinson M Paul, in his lecture, said: “Taking bribe or not working on duty hours equals to corruption. Now political bias exists in promotion and posting in civil service also. Only changing the mind-set of people can help to curb corruption. It is a digital world and I hope it will change.“
 
 A book 'Keralathile Udyogastha Rastreeyam: Bharanaparishkaranathinu Oru Aamukham' by   was also released in the event.
