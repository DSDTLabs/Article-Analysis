JHANSI: Union minister and   MP Uma Bharati announced here on Sunday that she would no longer contest elections. The Jhansi MP cited health issues to rule herself out of the fray in 2019. 

 Talking to reporters after a meeting to review development work, the firebrand leader also said she was not a contender for the chief minister’s post in  , where assembly polls are scheduled for the end of the year. “I have conveyed my wishes to the party (BJP) leadership not to force me to contest the next elections because my health conditions are not permitting me. I have a serious knee-joint and back problem, because of which my movements are becoming restricted. Even during the previous Lok Sabha election campaign, I had to use a helicopter due to these problems,” she said, 
 
 “However, I will continue to serve the party and campaign for the   elections in MP.” She said she was not satisfied with development work in her constituency as she was unable to give it proper time.
