VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra   has plans to build an   to its new   at an estimated cost of Rs 3.5 crore. The glorious structure on the   was built at a cost of Rs 13.5 crore and was inaugurated four months back (December 9).
 
 However, as reported by the TOI on Thursday, the centre has remained mostly unlit since then because of tepid response from event organisers and people alike. The AU-CC was built to serve both the university’s needs and also become a revenue generator through rents from hiring for seminars, workshops, marriages receptions etc.
 
 University officials, who seem to have noted certain disadvantages with the complex for conduct of various events, have now proposed the construction of the annexe which would house a mini conference hall and also a dining hall.
 
 “A few designs were prepared and the initial estimate of the annexe is coming to about Rs 3.5 crore. It would be a separate building contiguous with the main structure. We want to take up the project this fiscal with university funds,” Prof Uma Maheswara Rao,   registrar, told TOI. The plans include refurbishing the vast entrance arena into a multi-purpose hall, he added.
 
 While concurring with the TOI report, Rao said the mini conference hall with about 250 seating capacity would be ideal for smaller events and also to hold parallel sessions of a large scale conference. As there is no separate dining hall at present, dinners are arranged on the convention centre’s expansive lawns.
 
 A mini conference hall would have served the purpose of IIM-Visakhapatnam which conducted their second convocation at a nearby star hotel on March 29. “We were only about 250 members. As a small gathering like ours would look odd in a hall of 1,800 seating capacity, we chose to organise our convocation in a hotel. Otherwise we would have preferred to have it at the AU-CC. After all, our institution itself is sheltered in the AU campus as of now,” IIM-Vizag director   told TOI.
