GUWAHATI: The Gauhati high court on Friday stayed the   (GU) decision of conducting an entrance test for admission into various postgraduate courses for the academic session 2017-18. The HC however allowed the university authority to go ahead with the admission as per the existing mode on merit basis. The court directive comes after a number of fresh graduates moved the court opposing the GU decision. 

 Senior advocate SS   and M  , counsels of the petitioners, said, "The GU had decided to hold the entrance test via a recent notice without amending its previous ordinance in which it had said that admission into PG courses would be done on the basis of merit of the candidates in their respective graduation results. The entire process was violating the existing ordinance." tnn
