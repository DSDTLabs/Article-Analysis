PUNE: Manipuri activist   on Friday said her next project will be in the  , where she will interact with women affected by decades of conflict. She was speaking at an open interaction with the citizens of Pune.

 Sharmila became an icon for her 16-year hunger strike in Manipur to protest against the excesses of Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA). 
 
 “I will interact with the women who have been affected by the conflict, including widows, half-widows, or families who have lost members to the conflict. I want the women to pressure the governments for their rights, and for the investigations into the deaths,” Sharmila said. Her work is part of her appointment as an ambassador for Pune NGO Sarhad.
 
  “My ultimate plan is to fight for women in conflict zones. AFSPA should be repealed in Jammu & Kashmir as well,” she said.
 
 The interactive session, whose panel had members like Vidya Bal, lawyer   and Sharmila’s husband  , buzzed with the struggles of the women in Manipur and other conflict zones like Kashmir, her hunger strike, and her political plunge.
 
 She ran against the then-chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh and received just 90 votes. “For Manipuris, I was a symbol of resistance against AFSPA. When I ended my hunger strike, people thought that I had differed from that idea, ” she said. In response to a question on whether PM   “understands human rights”, she said, “ Let the people ask him. They voted for him.”
