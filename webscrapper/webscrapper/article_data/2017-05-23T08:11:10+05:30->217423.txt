 “The dogs were barking so loudly, I came out of my house and was so impressed to see them attacking the robbers that I have now started feeding stray dogs too, as they are so loyal,” said Sudhanshu Raj, a student and resident of the area.
 
 Talking about the incident, Kamna Pandey, member of the Animal welfare Board of India, with whom Shukla was a volunteer, said, “People generally treat stray dogs badly and object to others feeding and tending to them, as was the case with residents of Vishakha’s colony.
