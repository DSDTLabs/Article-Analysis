VISAKHAPATNAM: In what is suspected to be a fake kidnap drama, 22-year-old Sunkara   of Gajuwaka returned home safely on Thursday after going missing for almost 20 hours. 

 Lakshmi Vasanthi claimed that she was kidnapped by unidentified persons at Coromondel gate near Malkapuram on Wednesday. However, cops believe Vasanthi had eloped. She returned to the city following widespread coverage of the news on the media and fear of police action. After her return, Vasanthi refused to speak with the police and the media and was admitted to a hospital. 
 
 City joint commissioner of police AS Khan told media persons here on Thursday that Vasanthi had gone to her friend’s house on Wednesday and later messaged her family members and friends that she has been kidnapped. Malkapuram police registered a case and started tracking the girl’s mobile phone tower location and alerted the police in Vizag city and rural areas. 
 
  of harbour division K Ranga Raju and Malkapuram inspector D Kesava Rao said her cell phone was initially traced to Kotturu near Anakapalli, Tuni and later near Guntur. Mobile phone details of Vasanthi were also examined and it was found that she made as many as 3,600 calls to a person in Ongole of Prakasam district in the last three and half months.
