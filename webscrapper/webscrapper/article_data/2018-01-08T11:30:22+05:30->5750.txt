PANAJI: Goa state pollution control board ( ) will hold a crucial meeting of its members on Monday to decide whether consent to operate be granted to 21   leases, most of which have obtained environment clearance certificates.

 At least 17 companies had been granted environmental clearances (EC) by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) as per its 1994 notification on environment impact assessment (EIA).
 
 During its last meeting, convened to grant consent to operate to 12 mining leases, board members had expressed opinion that another meeting be held to consider the pending applications.
 
 The board had recently granted consent to five mining leases which had environmental clearances as required under the 1994 notification.
 
 The Supreme Court in Odisha mining case had observed that environment clearance issued under 1994 EIA notification is valid only for five years.
 
 Based on this judgment, pollution board had started the process not to renew the mining leases which had EC under 1994 notification. It had also issued show cause notices to those companies which had such clearances.
 
 Prior to the last meeting, board had taken legal opinion which advised it to grant consent to operate to leases which had environment clearance, but subject to court orders.
 
 Recently, the ministry had asked the board to conduct a fresh hearing for those leaseholders which had clearances under 1994 notification before granting fresh approval.
 
 Ministry advisor Surendra Kumar said in a letter sent to the state government departments concerned that the ministry had taken a decision that a fresh public hearing be held in Talaulicar & Sons Pvt Ltd lease case.
