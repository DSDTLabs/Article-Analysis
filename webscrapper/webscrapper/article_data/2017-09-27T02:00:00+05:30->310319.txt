PATNA: A   court in Patna on Tuesday awarded three-year rigorous imprisonment to National Buildings Construction Corporation Limited (NBCC)’s dismissed assistant engineer Krishna Singh and three others in a three-decade-old forgery case. The court also fined them Rs 25,000 each.

 However, special CBI court-I judge Praveen Kumar Singh granted provisional bail to them for 15 days to go in appeal against the conviction.
 
 Fifth accused Dr Chandreshwar Prasad Sinha, who was the superintendent of Jehanabad sadar hospital at the time of the crime, died during the trial. 
 
 The other three convicts are Krishna’s younger brothers Rajendra Singh and Saryu Singh and former police inspector Mahendra Prasad Gupta. Now septuagenarians, they all were present in the court on Tuesday.
 
 Special public prosecutor Shanti Bhushan told TOI Krishna, while posted in Delhi in 1989, purchased accidental insurance policies worth Rs 36.75 lakh from different insurance firms for one Anil Kumar Singh, whom he showed on paper as his younger brother.
 
 “Krishna made himself nominees in all the policies. He connived with Maheshwar, who was then the SHO of Makhdumpur police station in Jehanabad, and the then hospital superintendent to create necessary documents for claiming Anil’s insurance amount even as he did not have any brother named Anil,” Bhushan said.
 
 A fake FIR was lodged in the Makhdumpur police station, saying Anil died in a road accident. A fake postmortem report was also prepared. 
 
 “The accused had received Rs 10 lakh as insurance amount by the time time the CBI was tipped off,” Bhusan said, adding the central agency probed the case and filed its charge-sheet in 1991.
