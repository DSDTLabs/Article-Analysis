NASHIK: The printing of currency notes in the denomination of Rs 500, Rs 200, Rs 100 and Rs 20 has decreased by about 44% at the Nashik-based Currency Note Press (CNP). 

 
 While printing of Rs 500 notes was stopped in November last year, printing of Rs 200, Rs 100 and Rs 20 notes was stopped on April 1 this year. The printing of Rs 500 notes was stopped because CNP-Nashik had completed the target of printing 1,800 million pieces set by RBI for 2017-18. Similarly, it had to stop printing of currency notes of Rs 20 and Rs 100 on April 1 as new designs had been planned for these notes. 
 
 As far as printing of Rs 200 note is concerned, RBI had placed orders to CNP-Devas in  , following which   stopped production. CNP-Nashik is currently printing notes in the denomination of Rs 10 and Rs 50 only. 
 
 “Daily production has come down from 18 million pieces to 10 million pieces,” said a CNP Nashik functionary. “Since April 16, CNP-Nashik has re-started printing of Rs 500 notes, but in a very low quantity,” sources in Nashik said.
