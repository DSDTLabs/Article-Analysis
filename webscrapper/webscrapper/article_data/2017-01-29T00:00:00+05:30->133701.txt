After a marriage ends, there’s a significant period where both parties take a pretty brutal financial hit. All things joint needs a relook. What seemed like an investment is now simply a debt. Every time one of you falters, it directly affects the other’s credit. Find your new financial rhythm and sort out the joint debts smoothly and quickly.

 
 As logical and as necessary that split might feel at the moment, most people don’t let go of each other without some amount of bickering over assets or custody. If you want to get dirty, neither one of you will walk away unscathed. 
 
 
 Friends, who enjoyed your company as a couple, are caught in between, and may not want to take sides. They won’t be able to mingle as freely as they did. It shouldn’t be expected out of them. It’s better not to hold a grudge for talking to your ex either.
