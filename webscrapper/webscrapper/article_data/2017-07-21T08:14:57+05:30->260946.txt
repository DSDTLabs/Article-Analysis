PUNE: The civic administration will prepare a fresh   for 11 villages to be merged in the city limits this year.

 “The civic body will start the process of drafting the plan once the state government declares its intent to merge the villages. The notification for the   is expected to pave the way for the process,” said a senior official of the   (PMC).
 
 The official said the administration was likely to keep the DC (development control) rules same for the merged areas. It will keep uniformity about the construction activity. Only discussions and debates will be allowed on land reservations, that will be drafted based on local conditions. The state government on Wednesday decided to merge Uruli Devachi and Phursungi with the corporation besides completely merging nine villages partially brought under the civic limits in 1997.
 
 Three development plans — for the old city, 23 villages and Yewlewadi — already exist. The state had approved the DP for the old city area in January. Senior urban planner Ramchandra Gohad said, “Largely speaking, only two villages have been added, while nine have been included partially. A separate DP for the newly merged areas has to be drafted.”
