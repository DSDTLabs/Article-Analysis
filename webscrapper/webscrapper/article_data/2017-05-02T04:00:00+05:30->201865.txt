Surat: Parivartan Trust and Surat Brackish Water Research Centre, Olpad have demanded the status of a living entity for Tapi river on the lines of a high court’s order that granted this recognition to Ganga and Yamuna rivers recently. In a letter sent to the Prime Minister’s Office, these organizations said Tapi is the only source of water for the 50 lakh people of the city and should be kept pollution free and given the status of a living entity.

 Madhya Pradesh government is planning to enact a law to accord the status of a living entity to Narmada river and so Gujarat too must do the same for Tapi, the letter says. The letter sent to the PMO talks about the historical importance of Tapi river and its origins and how much damage weir cum causeway’s construction has done to it. The letter talks about the dying estuary of Tapi river. The construction of weir cum causeway in 1975 had stopped the river’s flow and converted it into a reservoir. 
 
 Parivartan Trust president Prakash Contractor said, “Tapi is in a pitiable condition. One portion of the river which flows towards the sea has gone dry due to sewage disposal and pollution caused by industries. There is an urgent need to protect this holy river in Surat and preserve its downstream ecology.” 
 
 The letter claimed that as of in 2017, Tapi was not alive anymore and that urgent steps were needed to help it regain its flow and majesty. There should be continuous flow of water in the river until the sea which will make the dead river’s estuary come alive and help restore its ecology.
