Tirupur: The Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (Tncsc) is all set to open 10 direct procurement centres (DPCs) for paddy in the district and is expected to procure about 25,000-30,000 metric tonnes.

 Tncsc plans to open DPCs at Kaniyur, Kallapuram, Maduthukulam, Alangiyam, Chikanapuram, Govindapuram, Koluthupalayam, Vellakoil, Muthur and Valliarachal on February 9. “Two to three additional DPCs may be needed in Kangeyam this year,” said a senior Tncsc official.
 
 “Tncsc will buy grade A paddy for Rs 16.60 per kg and pay Rs 16 for the rest of the varieties. Payment will be directly sent to the farmers’ bank accounts. The rate was fixed as per the Union government’s minimum support price,” the official said.
 
 “DPCs would be opened based on the request from farmers. Tncsc will consult with the agricultural department regarding paddy cultivation, besides its own field inspection, before finalising it. It would be done under the supervision of the collector,” he said.
 
 A senior agricultural department official said, “Normally, paddy cultivation is done in around 10,000 hectares in the district. But, due to the failure of the lower Bhavani project (LBP), only 7,500 hectares could be covered this year. Kangeyam block, which is located along the Erode district border, was the beneficiary of LBP.”
 
 Paddy on about 1,500 hectares will be ready for harvest within a week, the official added.
