NEW DELHI:   today mocked   for his "fake support for the Dalit community" and said that the famous French astrologer Nostradamus had predicted that "in 21st century, worldâ€™s best actor will be from India." According to Mevani, the actor in question is PM Modi.

  
  
 In the tweet, Mevani posted a video containing a couple of speeches by PM Modi where he can be seen advocating the rights of the Dalit community.
 
 The Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch convenor also accused PM Modi, who is yet to comment on the ongoing protests, of "lies" and termed his sympathy for the community "Fake Dalit Prem".
 
 The tweet was in the context of desecration of a samadhi of a Dalit icon in Pune by right-wing leaders Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote last week, which led to widespread protests by the Dalit community across Maharashtra.
 
 
 
 
 The duo had desecrated the samadhi to protest against the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the Bhima Koregaon battle in Puny by the members of the Dalit community. In the battle, soldiers from the Mahar community, who were fighting for the East India Company, defeated the Peshwa's army.
 
 
 
 
 On Tuesday, the Pimpri police booked Sambhaji Bhide, president of Shivjagar Pratisthan and Milind Ekbote, executive president of Samasta Hindu Aaghadi (SHA) for instigating a mob at Koregaon Bhima to indulge in violence.
 
 During the protests, Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Manch convenor was accused of making a provocative speech at an event in Pune.
 
 On Saturday last week, the Maharashtra Police said they had received a complaint against the Gujarat MLA and Dalit activist for his hate speech. Mevani had attended an event organised to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the battle of Bhima-Koregaon on December 31.
 
 Tension gripped many parts of Maharashtra after a youth's death in January during an event to mark the bicentenary celebrations of the battle near Pune.
