Bengaluru: The debt-laden   is holding advanced talks to sell its commercial office space business to southern builder   in a deal topping Rs 1,000 crore, or $160 million, people familiar with the matter said. 

 DivyaSree has emerged a strong contender to acquire  , which has a planned development of 7.8 million sqft special economic zone and non-SEZ office spaces at Manikonda in Hyderabad. The group flagship  , with Rs 43,000-crore debt, is among the 12 companies named by the   for action under the recently enacted Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
 
 The 50-acre office zone, a part of the ambitious integrated township Lanco Hills, is still in the early stages of development with just over half a million sqft space leased currently. Apart from DivyaSree,   and Canada’s   have also explored a deal with Lanco Hills.
 
 DivyaSree managing director Bhaskar Raju did not immediately respond to request for comments, when reached out by TOI. Repeated calls and text messages to Lanco executives remained unanswered.
 
 “DivyaSree at this moment does not have any vacant space in its commercial portfolio and therefore is ready to pay a premium to meet client’s needs,” sources cited earlier added. DivyaSree has a leased portfolio of about 8 million sqft which includes tenants such as US bank Wells Fargo, fund manager Invesco and technology giant Google.
 
 Lanco had launched the office zone claiming to make it the country’s tallest skyline and corporate hub. However, the group’s deteriorating debt profile and a morbid infra sector pushed back the real estate development plans significantly.
 
 When fully built,   offices could accommodate 75,000 people with 12,000-car park facility. Hyderabad has become a new investment destination for office space developers at a time when the city’s real estate market is on a revival mode after almost half a decade of political turmoil.
