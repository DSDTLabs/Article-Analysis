The first season of Bigg Boss Telugu got off to a flying start 
 

  
 Social media has been painted red with memes and posts, as netizens express disapproval of certain celebrity participants. While it was announced that there were only 12 contestants, the audience was taken by surprise when 14 celebs walked into the Bigg Boss house.
 
 
 As speculated, Sampoornesh Babu, Sameer, Archana Veda, Madhu Priya, Mumaith Khan, Kathi Mahesh, Kathi Karthika, Hari Teja, Jyothi, Adarsh Balakrishnan, Dhanraj and Siva Balaji will be locked up together. But none had guessed singer Kalpana and actor Prince, too, would be part of the show.
 
 
 Now, the Twitterati is debating if the show will lack spice. With all contestants, barring three — Archana Veda, Prince and Mumaith Khan — married with children, can ‘special friendships’ still be forged? Or, will the inmates put on a facade and play it safe, given that 60 cameras are focused on them?
 
 
 A majority of people are banking on Sampoornesh Babu, Kathi Mahesh, Madhu Priya and Mumaith Khan to up the element of drama, given their image. However, they are doubtful if the show can generate real entertainment with an inappropriate set of contestants being put together — unless a few catfights and fisticuffs break out.
