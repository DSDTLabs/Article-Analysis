AURANGABAD: The   of the   last week stayed a   (GR) that granted exemption to   for allotment of different development works up to a limit of Rs 10 lakh. 

 The GR dated July 12, 2016 had exempted MPs and MLAs from the e-tender process for works to be undertaken from their funds. While placing the next date for hearing on April 13, the court observed that "there is no convincing reason to grant such an exemption".
 
 Two agriculturists from Latur, Rahul Maknikar and Vitthal Hajgude, had approached the HC challenging clause no. 3 of the GR which granted the exemption to MPs and MLAs. Works above Rs 10 lakh have to go through the e-tender process. 
 
 The petitioners said that the state government had issued a GR on November 26, 2014, "making it a policy that every work above Rs 3 lakh has to be allotted only through the e-tender method... However, the government did not follow its own GR in the case of MLAs and MPs and instead issued another GR on July 12, 2016 granting them an exemption." 
 
 The HC bench of Justices R M Borde and P R Bora observed: "The basic purpose of observing a tender process is to maintain transparency in the allotment of tender works... It is a matter of surprise as to how the principle of transparency is being adopted in directing any enhancement in the monetary limits in respect of works to be allotted using funds provided to MPs and MLAs." 
 
 The petitioners said that earlier too, the state agriculture department had not followed the e-tender norms specified in the November 26, 2014 GR. In 2015, Hajgude and others had filed a writ petition in the high court in this regard.
