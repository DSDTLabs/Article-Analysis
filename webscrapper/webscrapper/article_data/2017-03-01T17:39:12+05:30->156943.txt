With Praktan still basking in the glory of 5 Filmfare awards this year, director-duo   and   are ready with their next venture. The first look of Posto is out and by the looks of it, this is going to be another blockbuster! With Praktan, the directors brought together   and   back in the same frame after a long 15 years. This time, it's Mimi, Jisshu,   and Lily Chakraborty in the lead. While Soumitra Chatterjee and Lily Chakraborty play grandparents in the film,   and   will be seen as a couple. The film was shot in Kolkata and Santiniketan.

 The director-duo is known for highlighting middle-class issues in their films and Posto is no different. The film revolves around a battle of guardianship between parents and grandparents over a kid, played by child artiste Argha Basu Roy. Sources tell us, there was an extensive audition conducted for the role of the child-- about 600 kids auditioned to land the role.
