The South film industry’s most eligible bachelor   might finally be off the market! According to latest reports, the ‘Baahubali’ hunk is reportedly ready to tie the knot and settle down with someone special selected by his parents. Various media reports suggest that d-day will be around the end of this year. 

 Prabhas has been very vocal about his aversion towards marriage, but on the alleged encouragement from his family members, the star has finally agreed to take the plunge. Don’t expect the star to open up about his marriage plans, as reports suggest he will only speak about the same, after the release of S.S.Rajamouli’s epic drama ‘Baahubali 2 - The Conclusion’. The actor is reportedly keeping mum because he doesn’t want the focus to shift away from his film. 
 
 Last year, Prabhas’ ‘Baahubali’ co-star   surprised thousands of fans when he posted a matrimonial advertisement to help his friend find a bride. 
 
 Only time will tell if these reports doing the rounds turn out to be true.
