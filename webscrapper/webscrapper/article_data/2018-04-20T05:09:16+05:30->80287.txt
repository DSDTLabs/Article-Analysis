NEW DELHI: Senior advocate Dushyant Dave’s attempt to link the statements of judicial officers accompanying judge B H Loya before his death to a   decision quashing criminal proceedings against   CM   drew sharp criticism from the   on Thursday. 

 The case related to the removal of construction in 1991, in which police registered a case of unlawful assembly, trespass and causing hurt against Fadnavis and others. The Nagpur bench of the Bombay HC quashed proceedings in 2017, saying the case had not proceeded for 26 years. 
 
 Citing this judgment, Dave had insinuated that “one individual is controlling the entire judiciary in Maharashtra and elsewhere”. A bench of Chief Justice   and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said, “We are rather surprised at the manner in which an insinuation has been made by producing the above order, which was passed in completely unrelated proceedings.” It added, “The attempt of the petitioners is to create prejudice and to malign the dignity of the judges, particularly of Justice B R Gavai.” 
 
 The bench said, “This is another instance in the course of the hearing of the present case where a matter extraneous to the subject of the inquiry has been sought to be relied upon to somehow sensationalise the case... What is worse is the manner in which wholly unfounded aspersions have been cast on the judges of the Bombay High Court.”
