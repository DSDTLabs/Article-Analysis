 Dhawan, who has been crowned as the man with impeccable comic timing is all about having fun on the sets of his next film 'Judwaa 2'. Be it touring the city with his crew or just goofing around on the sets, Varun has been doing it all. Keeping fans in on the latest happenings on the film sets, the actor recently shared a selfie of himself in the restroom on Instagram with a caption, "#shave #noshave."
 
  The 30-year-old looks amusing in the picture with shaving cream applied on his face. The all-time goofy and droll actor never fails to make us laugh, doesnâ€™t he?
