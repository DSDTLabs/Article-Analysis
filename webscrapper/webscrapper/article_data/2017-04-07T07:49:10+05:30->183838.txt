NEW DELHI: Congress and LDF members from   clashed in the   on Thursday over the police action against  's family in Thiruvananthapuram. 

 The issue was raised by Congress MP K C Venugopal, who said the situation in Left-ruled Kerala was worsening. This triggered protests from Left members from the state.
 
 Describing the incident as "unfortunate and inhuman", Venugopal said the police "brutally attacked" Jishnu's mother. The incident should be "treated seriously" and all the members should condemn it, he said. He also waived a copy of a Malayalam newspaper that had carried pictures of the incident. 
 
 Left members, including M B Rajesh, vociferously protested against the remarks and later trooped into the well of the house. 
 
 Venugopal and two other Congress members also went into the well. 
 
 As both sides raised their voices resulting in a ruckus, Speaker   adjourned the house for some time.
