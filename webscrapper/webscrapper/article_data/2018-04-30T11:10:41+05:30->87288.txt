JAIPUR:   police station arrested 28 inmates of two hostels after they clashed with each other on Saturday night. While all the students were later released, the police strictly directed them not to indulge in any kind of public scuffle ever again.

 Deputy commissioner of police (Jaipur East) Kunwar   said that Gandhi Nagar police had received information that some students were throwing stones at each other and clashing at a police place.
 
 The Gandhi Nagar police arrived at the place and took them to the police station. “None of them sustained any major injuries. But we had to book them as they were fighting on the road and created nuisance,” Rastradeep said, adding that there was some problems brewing between the inmates for past few days which snowballed into a full blown clash between the two groups.
 
 The Gandhi Nagar police also mediated between the warring factions and asked them to resolve the petty issues peacefully. According to police, the inmates of two hostels were at loggerheads following a tiff that took place a few days ago.
 
 The hostel rivalry in the city has been a long standing issue. On February 4, inmates of Meena and   hostels at   area had a public scuffle. The police intervened in time and arrested 31 rowdy inmates and issued a warning to wardens of both hostels to keep their inmates in check.
 
 Even on October 6 last year, the residents of Vijay Path area had a harrowing time when over three dozen rowdy inmates of Veer Gujjar Hostel pelted stones at locals, injuring a 40-year-old woman and vandalising two vehicles. The police arrested 33 students for disrupting law and order and sent them to the court.
 
 “We have been advising the hostels to take actions against the rowdy elements and ensure that outsiders do not stay in there hostel without proper permission,” an official said, adding that the student themselves have been told many a times that there wrong behaviour can land them in legal troubles.
