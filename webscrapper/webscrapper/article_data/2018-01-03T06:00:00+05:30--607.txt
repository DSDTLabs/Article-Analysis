If you are a regular commuter in the   area, a drive past the busy Hitex junction today will surprise you. After being shrouded in dust and smoke for months now, the colourful underpass that will be opened to public today, will make the junction which sees over 9000 vehicles per hour, seem like a seamless blend of engineering, architecture, art and convenience.
The city’s first underpass, linking   road and Hitec City road, will bring in much relief to the traffic-stressed area.
  “This route helped in reaching Jubilee hills road without having to get stuck in the traffic at Madhapur. So when the work began five months ago, it just added to the blocks everywhere,” recounts  , an IT employee and frequent commuter. 
 
 However, with the work being completed ahead of schedule, the underpass will now help cut the travel time by 15-30 minutes in rush hours.
 The completion also brings much needed relief from traffic snarls which affected other routes. “While coming from  , even though we had a free left to go towards Forum, it was useless as it was blocked due to the traffic at this junction heading to 100 Feet Road. Hopefully this underpass will fix this,” adds Shashank Shekhar, a techie.
 
 However, some are critical of the 450-metre-long underpass. “An underpass should help cross at least 2-3 signals spanning over 1-2 kms. This underpass only lets commuters evade traffic at one signal. Why spend so much on something which will be of no use in 10 years when traffic increases?” asks citizen activist  , who works on road issues.
 However, authorities maintain that the flyover has been made with the traffic flow of 20 years from now in mind.
