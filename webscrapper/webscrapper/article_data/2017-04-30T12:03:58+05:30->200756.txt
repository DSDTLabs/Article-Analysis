 finds her sweet shop papers in  's house and realises her purpose of being in the house. Masi sa then takes Kanak to meet Uma's mother and her sister Ganga. Masi sa tells Ganga to get rid of the bed now and stand on her feet. The newly wed couple take Ganga's blessings.
 
 Kanak's phone starts ringing and Gabba sa brings her bag to her. He tells everyone that he kept her bag safely when she was dressing up for the marriage. When   says that now they could know all about the bride and his family, just then Kanak is reminded about what Uma Shankar can do to his family, so she throws away the phone in hot coal. Suman fumes with anger and starts saying that they have been tolerating her a lot and now this has become just too much, just then Uma stops her and asks them to take her inside her room.
 
  
  
 Kanak looks for windows from where she can escape, but cannot find her way out. Just them Uma comes in, and that scares Kanak.
  
 She then locks herself in the washroom, and Uma keeps requesting her to come out. He says he has to tell something important that a pundit once told him. She runs the tap and refuses to listen to anything he says.
