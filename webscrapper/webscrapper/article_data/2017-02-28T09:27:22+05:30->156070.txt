Following Supreme Court guidelines, Mumbai Police's licensing branch has granted permits to three dance bars in accordance with old norms, which are less stringent than a new law. 

 But the bars have decided not to act immediately and wait for the final verdict. The police are scrutinising applications received from 70 other bar owners in the last two months.
 
 The three dance bars given licences on Monday are Indiana in Tardeo, and Aero Punjab and Sai Prasad in Andheri. Provisional licenses given to the three had lapsed last August as they couldn't fulfil norms under the new   law. 
 
 In November, the Supreme Court said the state should consider granting dance bar licenses under rules set in 2014, and not under the 2016 law [Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurants and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (working therein) Act]. After the directive, the three bars reapplied, and have now got their licences.
