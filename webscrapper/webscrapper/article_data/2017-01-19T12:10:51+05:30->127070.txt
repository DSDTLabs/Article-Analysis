 The baby was wrapped in a plastic bag and a loose knot was tied around his neck. The hospital authorities got to know about the abandoned baby when a female patient who is presently undergoing psychiatric treatment noticed the plastic bag. The woman immediately alerted a nurse who in turn informed a resident doctor and a servant.
 
 The trio wrapped the baby in a cloth and immediately rushed it to the paediatric department of the nearby Ruxmani and   where he has been kept under observation in neonatal ICU. “The baby seems to be just one or two days old. He weighs 2.3 kg but was suffering from hypothermia and hence kept in incubation box. The baby had some breathing difficulties but now he is stable,” said a doctor of the paediatric department.
 
 “We have started antibiotic treatment as there are chances of infection. Based on further reports, we will decide the further line of treatment,” said the doctor. 
 
 As per the procedure, SSG officials will inform the local police to locate the baby’s parents. If the police fail to locate the parents, the baby will be handed-over to the Nari Sanrakshan Gruh.
