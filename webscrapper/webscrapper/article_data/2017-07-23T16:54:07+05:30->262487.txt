Mysuru: Chief Minister   said people will not accept the   which had divided the society but claims to achieve its ideal of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas. 

 After laying the foundation stone for the Kanaka Community Hall at Channarayapatna on Saturday, Siddaramaiah slammed the Modi government for dividing the people. “Congress believes in the democratic system where people are considered gods. The   government follows the principle of Buddha, Basavanna and BR   while formulating welfare programmes in the interest of the people,” he said. 
 
 Reiterating that the Congress government has fulfilled 155 of the 165 promises in its manifesto, Siddaramaiah said he has waived off Rs 8165 crore of farmers’ loans in cooperative banks. “In Hassan district, more than Rs 390 crore out of Rs 490 crore farm loans in cooperative banks was waived off. But the central government is yet to waive off Rs 41,000 crore farm loans in nationalized banks, which indicates its concern towards farmers,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, pointing out that the government has released Rs 50 lakh for the construction of Kanaka Samudhaya Bhavan, he said the government will release Rs 50 lakh more for the work soon. “The government, which is promoting social justice, will take up samudhaya bhavans and provide land to educational institutions for the uplift of backward classes,” he said. 
 
 Later, Kaginele Mahasamsthanan Peeta seer Shivanandapuri Swami said he has sought 25 acres from the government for starting an educational institution.
 
 Animal husbandry minister and district in-charge A Manju, MLAs HD Revanna, CN Balakrishna, MLC HM Revanna and others were present. 
 
 The CM had to cancel the review meet to assess works taken up at Shravanabelagola for the Mahamastabishekha due to certain constraints. The government has released the first installment of Rs 40 crore of the Rs 175 crore budgeted for the event.
