If you follow   news, you’d have heard of Prince Charles calling for the popular Scottish tradition, Highland Games, to be included in physical education classes at schools. For the uninformed, in Scotland, Highland   is a gala where men tussle or turn to bagpipes for aerobic exertion.

 Among other things, Highland Games’ activities include tossing the caber (a heavy pole made from a larch tree) and ‘Tug-o-War’. At a time, when fitness fanatics and fans are willing to try newer and fresher workouts to keep themselves challenged, maybe tossing the caber will be the next ‘it’ workout! 
 After all, crossfit, combat training, boot camps, new variations of yoga like goat yoga and bro-ga, are already seeming done and dusted. Enter tossing a caber – an aerobic and strength workout that is a back-to-the-roots exercise too. Will it be the next big thing?
