NEW DELHI: As students prepare for JEE (Advanced), there are few important guidelines for the students to ease down their nerves ahead of the examinations. More often than not, students slip into a panic mode just a few weeks before the exam which although natural, is not the best thing to have.

 Founder of Vidyamandir Classes, Brij Mohan Gupta said, “How you spend these last few days will play a crucial part in shaping your future.” A very important thing to keep in mind would be to better your core strength areas, which will go a long way in boosting your confidence level. It is almost a disaster to start with new chapters. It is a good idea to get your hands on some previous-year papers. It will stimulate your mind so that you are more comfortable on the day of the actual examination.
 
 
 “A lot of students are sceptical about attempting questions they are unsure about. Do not waste your time to answer the questions that you are uncertain about. However, do not hesitate to take a chance if you are reasonably sure about the answer,” said Pratibha Jain, a Mumbaibased career counsellor.
 
 
 Gupta also advised meditation for about half-an-hour daily to increase concentration among students. “Try to shift your biological clock as per the exam timings. If you are solving past years’ papers, do so at the same time as the actual paper would be at,” he said.
