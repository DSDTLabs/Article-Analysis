In a meeting held between the state education department officials, the director of technical education, and college authorities, the issue was raised again. 

 Last year, the results were announced in the third week of May after which booklets and PINs were distributed. This time the process will begin from May 15. It is not yet known when class 12 board results will be declared. In fact, GUCET will be conducted on May 10.
 
 ACPC officials have given booklets for printing and will get the entire stock readied within a week. 
 
 The admission committee has expedited the process so that students get enough time to study the booklets, understand the process of admissions and selecting college preferences.
 
 The ACPC has introduced a new rule which will bring major relief to students. If seats remain vacant in any of the institutes, students who have not secured admissions anywhere would be directly allocated seats. Earlier, the ACPC used to wait for studentsâ€™ consent before doing so.
