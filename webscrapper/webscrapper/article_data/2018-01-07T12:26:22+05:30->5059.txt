DEHRADUN: The wildlife warden of   Tiger Reserve   and reserve director Sanatan   got involved in a tiff after the latter asked Singh a few months ago to file an FIR against 21 daily wagers whose names were approved for forest guard postings by the then Rajaji director in 2015.
 
  Sonkar disapproved of the appointment when he took charge as reserve director in 2016 and asked Singh to register the FIR. However, Singh said that Sonkar is dragging him in a legal case where he played no role.
  
  Singh said, “The director wants to drag me in a legal case and is trying to defame me. I will slap a defamation case on the director for tarnishing my image.” All the 21 applicants have since moved the high court in the matter.
  
  Sonkar had earlier told   that 16 of 21 daily wagers had submitted fake documents with the connivance of the then range officer   and others too had irregularities in their appointments.
  
  He said that he asked Singh to file an FIR against the accused in this matter but Singh has not done so yet.
 
  Singh added that the director should file an FIR himself as all appointments of forest guards were approved at the director level. “Irregularities were spotted in the appointments and action was also taken by the then director. I was never part of the appointment process.”
  
  Singh said, “I had asked for the original documents from the director before filing the FIR which was not provided to me. I am being kept in the dark and yet I am expected to file an FIR.”
