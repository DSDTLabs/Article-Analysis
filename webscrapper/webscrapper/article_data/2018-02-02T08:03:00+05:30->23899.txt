NOIDA: The viscera report of a   student, whose mysterious death last year had triggered attacks on some Nigerian nationals over allegations that they had drugged him, has found no traces of   in his body.

 Police in Kasna, who received the medical report recently, said the charges against five   booked earlier would be dropped and their passports returned.
 
 “The viscera report came recently. The cause of death is — ‘NIL’. It does not state any drug overdose or poison,” said BK Verma, the SHO of Kasna police station.
 
 Manish Khari, a Class XII student, had been reported missing on March 25 last year. The next day, he was found in a trance-like state outside his house in Sector Pie 2 and died later in hospital. His family had alleged that some Nigerian students staying in the neighbourhood had drugged him, causing his death.
 
 A candlelight march in Manish’s memory had turned violent and several African nationals were assaulted in Ansal Plaza Mall and Pari Chowk in Greater Noida. External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj had ordered a probe into the matter.
 
 Five persons were arrested and five Nigerians detained for questioning were later released for lack of evidence. Manish’s post-mortem report had stated the cause of death as “unknown” and his viscera were sent for an examination.
 
 Zakiyyu Muhammad, senior public prosecutor representing the Nigerian government and the general secretary of the Nigeria Citizens’ Welfare Association, said: “We love India. But we are being treated as second-class citizens. People had levelled allegations of cannibalism against us. It is a lie. We need an open and welcoming India.”
