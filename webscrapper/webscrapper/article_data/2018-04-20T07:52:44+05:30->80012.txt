CHENNAI:   on Thursday said it had changed the marks of six journalism students after an external examiner re-evaluated their  , as part of an inquiry, and found that they had been incorrectly assessed.

 The marks change has resulted in four of the students securing   marks, the syndicate announced after a meeting. The university had earlier declared that the students had failed.
 
 Twelve MA (journalism) students lodged a complaint with the vice-chancellor in February, accused the head of the  , G Ravindran, of not showing them their answer scripts after  , as required by regulations. They alleged that there were irregularities in the evaluation. After a protest by three students, the varsity had eight answer scripts re-evaluated and formed a committee under the dean (academic) to look into the issue.
 
 On Thursday, it emerged that there has been a change of marks in six of the eight answer scripts. “In some papers, the examiner had awarded 48 or 47 marks and yet failed the students without giving grace marks. Students have passed those papers after re-evaluation,” a senior official said. A source said that in two papers there were minor changes, but did not result in securing the students a pass mark.
 
 Syndicate members wondered if action would be taken against the  , that the allegations were proven correct. VC P Duraisamy announced a revamp in the evaluation methodology to address similar grievances.
