Actor  , who is busy with his acting commitments, has directed a short film titled, The Broken Tide. The film revolves around the relationship between a separated couple. 

 'I have never aspired to become a director nor was I planning to direct a short film. But I kept writing. It was one of those instances that prompted me to develop this one-liner into a story. That's when the idea of doing a short film came up,' he says. Talking about the film, he says, 'The film talks about the complexities in a relationship. The story revolves around a couple, that is on the verge of getting divorced. But they are forced to travel together for a common friend's wedding. How they deal with the silence and what prompts two people, who are madly in love at point, find differences among each other form the crux. The climax, which goes on for 10-odd minutes, has come out really well. I am planning to send it to film festivals before releasing it online. Recently, it was even picked up Bengaluru International Film Festival... one of the very few Tamil films to be screened.' The film has Sulile and   playing the lead. 
 
 Sulile, though, says that acting will be his priority. 'I am busy with a couple of film commitments. I will begin work on  's   in the next couple of weeks,' he signs off.
