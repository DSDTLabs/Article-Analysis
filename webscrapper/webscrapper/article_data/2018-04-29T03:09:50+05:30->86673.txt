NEW DELHI: There will be no delay in the declaration of CBSE class X and XII results. The results are expected by the third or fourth week of May with   likely to be declared first. Last year, Class XII results were declared on May 28, while   came out on June 3.

 According to a senior CBSE official, despite the re-test of Class XII economics and the postponement of two exams due to a strike, there will be no delay in the declaration of results.
 
 “The Class XII economics exam has to be re-conducted on April 25. Also, the Class XII Hindi and Class X French, Sanskrit and Urdu paper had to be postponed to April 27 in Punjab due to a request from the state government because of a strike. The progress of evaluation has, however, been on time and the results will be declared on time,” a Board official said.
 
 The official didn’t give an exact date, but said that the majority of evaluation is likely to be completed by May second week.
