Tapioca farmers from Salem, Namakkal and   districts on Friday petitioned the   district administration seeking stern action against some units in Salem for manufacturing adulterated sago. They also threatened to go on indefinite protest if the government fails to take action against the units. 

 After submitting a petition to district collector Rohini R Bhajibhagare, president of   (SACFA) S Govindarajan said many manufacturers were adulterating maize flour in sago. "Sago manufacturers import maize flour from   and Thailand as it is available in cheaper price in these countries," he said. He said due to adulteration of sago and starch with maize starch, the procurement prices of tapioca and sago starch have fallen drastically. tnn
