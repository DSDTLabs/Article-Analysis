MADURAI: The body of K  , the 22-year-old fisherman who was allegedly shot dead by the Sri Lankan naval forces at sea a week ago, was laid to rest after being given a heroâ€™s farewell by his fellow villagers and members of the public at his native village Thangatchimadam on Monday. After the burial, the   leaders decided to temporarily withdraw their agitation and take a call on their future course of action after meeting the secretary of   at Delhi shortly. 

 Fishermen in Rameswaram and the surrounding regions as also their counterparts in other districts across the state have been protesting for the past week after Bridjo was shot dead. They refused to accept his body after the postmortem demanding that measures be taken to prevent the Sri Lankan navy from attacking them.
 
 Sources said that over 6,000 mechanised boats had stayed away from work in the last one week leading to heavy loss of income for the fishermen and the boat owners. On Sunday, Union minister   and her counterpart   had met them at the protest site urging them to give up the protest. Though this was accepted by a section of protesters, another group opposed the idea.
 
 On Monday, the body of Bridjo was received from government hospital in Ramanathapuram by one of his relatives and brought to the site of the protest. People stood in long queues and paid their last respects to him after which family members and fellow villagers gave him a tearful farewell. The body is to be buried at a tomb constructed in the Thangatchimadam cemetery.
 
 Fishermen leaders said that they have decided to withdraw their protest based on the request from the Union ministers and would set out fishing from Tuesday. The future course of action will be decided after they meet MEA officials, they said.
