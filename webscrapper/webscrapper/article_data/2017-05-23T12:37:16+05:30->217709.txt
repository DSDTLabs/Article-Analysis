NAGPUR: Maharashtra Veej Grahak Sangathana (MVGS) has filed a   in   (MERC) against load-shedding. MVGS leader   has charged MSEDCL with mismanaging the power situation.

 Hogade stated in the petition that as per MSEDCL itself, the state was supposed to be power surplus during summer of 2017. While MSEDCL was claiming a shortfall of 4,000 MW, as per its own power tariff petition, it had 9,500 MW surplus power. Either the MSEDCL has deliberately asked power generation companies to keep their units shut down or there is massive mismanagement on its part, Hogade has contended.
