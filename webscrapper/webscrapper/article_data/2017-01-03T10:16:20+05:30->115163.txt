DOHA: It wasn't the sharpest of starts for defending champion   at the Khalifa International Complex, but the Serb, rediscovering his joy for the journey, didn't really mind. The 29-year-old, looking slimmer, if indeed that is possible, rallied to pull off a 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 win over his practice partner in the off-season German JanLennard Struff in the first round of the   ExxonMobil Open. 

 The Serb, who hit with the mop-haired 26-year-old at the Mouratoglou Academy in Nice for almost two weeks in December, was familiar with the 6 ft 3 pro's big-serving, heavy-striking style of play. That was perhaps why he appeared stirred, not shaken even when he trailed 1-5 in the opening set.
 
 “Today was not the greatest of starts, let's be honest. I took a little time to get used to Struff 's game, he played aggressive and served big, full credit to him. But once I got used to his serve and found my game, I was able to play good,” Djokovic said, adding that he was playing with `no pressure, only joy and happiness'.
 
 Djokovic believes he had lost some of the spark for a sport he played more for the love of it. The feeling, which he often describes as a 'sensation', was the overriding emotion, he says, in his success story until the pressure got to him. That is also believed to be the reason why Djokovic punctuated a successful partnership with mentor   in December.
 
 He has since tied up with countryman  , a close friend, better known for his doubles exploits. Vemic, who is in Doha, was coaching the Bryan Brothers Bob and Mike, but will now work with the world No.2 on a priority basis.
