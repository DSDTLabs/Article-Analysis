PUNE: An extended range forecast from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has indicated a fall in the minimum temperatures in Maharashtra from January 25 or 26. Similar conditions will prevail in parts of central, western and northwestern India.

 Overall, the night temperatures are likely to be below normal across most of India — outside the Western Himalayan region — between January 26 and February 1.
 
 In Pune, on most days in January this year, the maximum, as well as minimum temperatures, have been above normal. The maximum temperature in Pune (Shivajinagar) was below normal only on January 6, 8, 9 and 10. Meanwhile, the minimum temperatures have been above-normal every day this year till now.
 
 A senior IMD official said an intense western disturbance, which is currently positioned over western   and its neighbourhood, is likely to approach India by January 22. This will affect the weather until January 24. “Once the western disturbance has passed, the temperatures may dip in northwest India under the influence of the dry and cold northwesterly winds. These winds may also influence temperatures in   and Maharashtra,” he said.
 
 Temperature variation in the state depends on the kind of winds blowing into it: If moisture-laden winds come in from the   or the  , temperatures here rise. Conversely, if winds from the north flow into the state, temperatures nosedive.
