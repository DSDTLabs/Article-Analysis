Yes, we all get emotional about this day; after all, a mother is the only person who doesn’t mind not getting paid for her unconditional, endless job as a mother. How does one ever pay back? Well, by loving her, respecting her, caring for her when she starts ageing and just being there for her when she needs you. Now before your eyes well up, hold on; we need to have a reality check here! Every day does not feel like Mother’s Day (even though it should)!

So mummies, if you want to stay yummy, follow these basic principles in life:
 
 
 Happy Mother’s Day!
