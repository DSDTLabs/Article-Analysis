PANAJI: Chief minister Laxmikant   on Thursday told TOI that the exit polls have indicated a clear mandate for the   in the state despite the RSS rebel group that was headed by Subhash Velingkar and the   not working with the party. He further said that the party would garner more seats than have been predicted. 

 “The RSS rebel group targeted the government for almost a year. Despite this, the people have appreciated the good work done by the government on all fronts. There has not been an anti-incumbency factor,” Parsekar said, adding that the various social schemes launched by the BJP regime have helped the party overcome the campaign led by the MGP and the RSS rebel group against it. 
 
 The chief minister also that while there were a lot of allegations of scams against the   government ahead of the 2012 assembly election, there hasn’t been any such allegation against the BJP government, “which is the reason why the people of the state were bound to give a mandate to the BJP”. 
 
 He said most of the exit polls are accurate and despite the hype created by the opposition, they have given the “correct picture”. When asked whether he would stake claim to become the CM yet again, Parsekar said, “The elected MLAs will decide.”
