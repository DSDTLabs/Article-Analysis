GORAKHPUR: Appearing for the first time in  ,   managed to secure 14th position in the state but fared poorly in   with a dismal 314th rank. 

 The city scored 756 points out of a total of 2,000 in the Swachh Sarvekshan 2017 ( ). The survey allots 900 points for solid waste management, which includes garbage collection, disposal, treatment and open defecation, and 600 points for citizens' feedback. 
 
 The national rank has exposed the city's lack of a solid waste disposal plant and garbage disposal system.
 
  "In 2010, the city got Rs 36 crore for constructing a solid waste plant but the project never materialised due to a land dispute. The city could have got a 1.5 mega watt, electric plant with door-to-door garbage collection system if the project had materialised," said mayor Satya Pandey. 
 
 A team from the Swachh Sarvekshan visited the city in January this year and claimed that the city does not have a Gorkahpur Municipal Corporation-owned community toilet. "The city has adequate number of safai karamchari (cleaner) as per the norms." Municipal Commissioner, BN Singh said. 
 
 Gorakhpur also lacks a proper sewerage system and some of the drainage systems are as old as 1956.
