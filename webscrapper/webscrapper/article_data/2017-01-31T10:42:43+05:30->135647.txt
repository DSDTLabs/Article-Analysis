BHOPAL:   government is apparently worried over losing a prime land in Bhopal city. In 2015, MP High Court (MPHB) had ordered the state government to restore ownership of 25.57 acres of land acquired by the   from farmers near BHEL Township, terming acquisition process as illegal.

 The MPHB moved   with a submission that they were ready to pay Rs 4 crore as compensation. The apex court has rejected the offer, asking the state government to submit a fresh proposal before it.
 
 “Petitioners (MP government) are directed to file a statement as to the benefits which can be extended to the respondents (farmer), in the peculiar facts of this case,” SC ordered on Friday. Next hearing has been posted for February 23. 
 
 “The current market value of this land is more than Rs 100 crore and the MPHB has admitted on their official records. In any case, farmers do not want the money. They want their land back,” said Varun Chopra, advocate for farmers.
 
 The said land – bearing khasra numbers 56,58, 59, 60,69 and 70 – is located in village Khajuri Kalan, thesil Huzur, district Bhopal. The house board wanted this land to implement a land development scheme.
 
 The state government was approached and in 1987-88, the collector, Bhopal and the land acquisition officer, Bhopal, initiated proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 for acquiring 25.57 acres of land bearing Khasra No 57, 58, 59, 60, 69 and 70 situated in village Khajuri Kalan, tehsil Huzur in district Bhopal. 
 
 Challenging the acquisition, farmer Purushhotam Lal and others filed a petition raising objection that the acquisition under the land acquisition Act of 1894 was illegal. When the HC issued orders in favour of the farmers, the MPHB moved Supreme Court.
