CHENNAI: A no-confidence motion moved by leader of the opposition   against   P Dhanapal in the   on Thursday was defeated, with 97 members voting in favour of the motion and 122 voting against it. Thus the K Palaniswami government for the second time has proved that it has majority in the House. The government received 122 votes in the February 18 trust vote too.

 Former chief minister O Panneerselvam and MLAs supporting him were not present in the House. Former DGP and Mylapore MLA R Natraj, who voted against the government during the trust vote on February 18, voted for the government on Thursday.
 
 Before allowing Stalin to move the motion, Dhanapal stated that he had been appointed by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa and she had praised the way the House was managed by him. 
 
 "There are two instances when my happiness reached its zenith. Both the incidents were when Jayalalithaa praised me. There are two instances that saddened me the most. The first one when I read out the obituary reference to my leader (Jayalalithaa) and another on February 18 about the behaviour of   members," said Dhanapal.
 
 When Dhanapal went to his chamber, Deputy Speaker Pollachi Jayaraman took charge of the House. He put the motion for voice vote and later for division.
 
 After no-confidence motion was defeated and the speaker returned to his chair to the thumping of desks by the ruling party MLAs, deputy leader of the opposition S Duraimurugan said: "We moved the motion knowing that we did not have the numbers. You said Jayalalithaa had praised you for the way you conducted the House. Our wish is that you would get our praise also at the end of the present assembly."
