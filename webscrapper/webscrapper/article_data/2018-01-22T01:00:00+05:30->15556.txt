MOTIHARI: The department of animal husbandry, dairying & fisheries has initiated a number of schemes with the objective of doubling the   farmers’ income by 2022. The Government of India has taken several initiatives to increase milk production by raising the productivity of milch animals, said Union minister for agriculture & farmers’ welfare Radha Mohan Singh here on Saturday. 

 The minister said that for the last 20 years, India continues to be the largest milk producer in the world and the credit goes to the government initiatives and implementing various schemes to increase the productivity of milch animals. Milk production, which was around 17-22 million tonnes in the 1960s, increased to 165.4 million tonnes during 2016-17. Particularly, it has increased by 20.12% during 2016-17 in comparison to 2013-14.
 
 Moreover, income of milk producers increased by 23.77% during 2014-17 in comparison to 2011-14. The minister said that factors such as increased consumer interest in high protein diets and increasing awareness and availability of value-added dairy products through organised retail chains are also driving its demand. During the last 15 years, milk cooperatives have converted about 20% of milk procured into traditional and value-added products that offer about 20% higher revenue. 
 
 “For the first time our government started a new initiative called Rashtriya Gokul Mission in December 2014 for conservation and development of indigenous breeds. Under this scheme, so far proposals worth Rs.1,348 crore from 28 states have been approved and Rs.503 crore has been released. Among other initiatives, Rashritya Gokul Mission also includes setting up of Gokul Gram. These Gokul Grams will act as centres for development of indigenous breeds and a dependable source for supply of high genetic breeding,” he said adding, “Currently, 18 Gokul Grams are being set up in 12 different states.”
 
 He also said the World Bank -funded National Dairy plan Phase I is being implemented by National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) in coordination with the respective state governments and cooperative institutions/state dairy federations. Under this scheme, 29 sub-projects for Bihar with a total grant of Rs.64.46 crore have been approved and Rs.37.04 crore was released in December 2017. These sub-projects have been targeted to benefit 1.5 lakh dairy farmers in 2,928 villages.
