 Soon after BJP came to power, the Aditya Nath Yogi government constituted a high-power committee to review the project. To be built at a cost of Rs 1,513 crore, the committee found that the project had remained incomplete despite majority of the funds being spent.
 
 The committee finalised its report in May and submitted its findings before the government. A group of ministers also examined the matter thereafter and a decision was taken to get the matter investigated by police.
 
 On June 19, an executive engineer of irrigation department lodged an FIR at Gomtinagar police station on the basis of the 74-page inquiry report. Headed by retired high court judge Alok Kumar Singh, the committee focused on alleged irregularities and anomalies. Engineers involved with the project, namely Gulesh Chandra, S N Sharma, Kazim Ali, Shivmangal Yadav, Akhil Raman, Kamleshwar Singh, Roop Singh Yadav, and Surendra Yadav were booked under IPC sections 409 (breach of trust by public servant), 420 (cheating) and under Prevention of Corruption Act.
 
 Home secretary (IPS) Bhagwan Swarup Srivastava confirmed the matter related to riverfront project was sent to the department of personnel and training. “If the agency takes over, it will probe the role of people associated with the project and besides those named in the FIR, accountability of other officers will be examined too,” said the home secretary. Since senior IAS officers of Uttar Pradesh have monitored the project closely and also approved the funds, the CBI inquiry may spell trouble for them and for other influential persons too.
