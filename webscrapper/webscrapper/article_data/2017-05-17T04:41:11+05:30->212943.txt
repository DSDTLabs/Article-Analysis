DEHRADUN: After 17 pilgrims died on   in 19 days, 16 of them due to cardiac arrest, devotees have blamed the lack of cardiologists in health facilities set up on the yatra route for the spike in the number of cases. They have also blamed the state government for the lack of proper medical facilities on the route.  , a pilgrim from Kanpur said, “We were cautioned by villagers here that none of their local hospitals have cardiologists. Everyone needs to rethink about health facilities on the   route.”

  doesn’t have a single cardiologist in any of its government hospitals though 23 posts are sanctioned. Currently, there are two cardiologists in the entire state who obtained a diploma in cardiology after their MBBS and are not MD or MS. Both of them have applied for voluntary retirement.
 
 Health department officials, on the other hand, have claimed pilgrims don’t adhere to the dos and don’ts prescribed by the department. “We note pilgrims in   roaming around in T-shirts and normal shoes,” said Dr Tripti Bahuguna, health department nodal officer.
 
 She said, “Majority of deaths have occurred among pilgrims who were in their sixties and most of them must be suffering from high/low blood pressure, diabetes, respiratory problems, which exacerbate while one takes up the journey to higher altitudes.”
