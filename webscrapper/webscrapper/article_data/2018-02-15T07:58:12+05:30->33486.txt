KOCHI: First the good news. There has been an increase in the   along the coastal and estuarine regions of the state.

 The mangrove cover has increased from eight square km to nine square km within a span of 14 years, shows the India State of Forest Report-2017.
 
 
 Mangroves are spread over an area of 4,921 square km in India. The mangrove data on   became officially available from 2003 onwards and ever since the assessment began there has been a marginal increase in mangrove cover in the state, the report said.
 
 “The state does not have dense mangrove cover but has five kilometre of moderately dense mangrove cover and four kilometres of open mangroves,’’ the report said.
 
 Dr V S Vijayan, former chairman of   said that it is laudable that the state has been able to increase its mangrove cover. He attributed it to initiatives of small independent neighbourhood groups living along the coast who have realised the importance of conservation of mangroves.
 
 “We need to notify these mangrove lands so that they remain untouched. The protection of mangroves is of great significance especially as the entire west coast is facing the brunt of climate change and threat of rising sea levels in the future,” he said. The report pointed out that main factors for depletion of mangroves include lack of oxygen, high salinity and diurnal tidal inundation.
 
 “India’s contribution to the total mangrove cover in   is 45.8%. The complex root system facilitates accumulation of organic and inorganic nutrients, thus acting as a breeding and nursing ground for various marine and pelagic species. They act as an important source for the coastal communities dependent on collection of honey, tannin, wax and fishing. They protect coastal areas from storm surges and tsunamis,’’ the report said.
