NOIDA: The   from Sector 15 Metro station is the least profitable of all the routes where NMRC city buses are plying. Only about 250-300 passengers use the bus, whose frequency is 15 minutes, each day.

 Sandeep Raizada, officer on special duty, NMRC told TOI NMRC was considering merging this route with another upcoming route going towards Sector 62. “As the route is getting a poor response, we might scrap it and link it with the planned Sector 62 route,”   said.
 
 One can board the bus from the Sector 15 Metro station from as early as 5.30am to 11pm. 
 
 The main reason for the M1+ route for failing to attract passengers is availability of other options like e-rickshaws and autos, which ferry commuters at a lesser or almost similar fare.
 
 The e-rickshaws have been plying illegally along the Metro route.
