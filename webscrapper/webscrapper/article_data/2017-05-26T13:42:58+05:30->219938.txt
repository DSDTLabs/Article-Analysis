NAGPUR: Members of Tiger   Sanghatana ( ) and   (VACF) had organized a meet to discuss the various problems faced by them and decide the future course of action to redress their grievances, at Amrut Bhavan, North Ambazari Road, on Thursday. Over 500 autorickshaw drivers gathered at the meeting discussed the problems they faced and the policies of the state government. 

 Javed Sheikh, president of TAS, criticized the decision of not allowing autos to pick and drop school-going children unless they had a capacity of 13 seats. This would directly affect their livelihood, he added. He blamed the traffic police, RTO and transport department of   for compounding their problems. He said that though autorickshaw owners were ready to ply by meter, passengers often travel in illegal rickshaws to save money, which affected their income. Cab services, illegal passenger taxis and e-rickshaws were also affecting their business, he added.
 
 Anand Chavre, secretary of VACF, said, “The condition of auto drivers was worsening every passing day. Rickshaws without permit were taking over city transport service, but the government was acting as a mute spectator. One of the main reasons for this problem is lack of unity among autorickshaw drivers. We should come together to fight against the government policies that were affecting business,” he added.
 
 Vilas  , president of VACF, targeted chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and union transport minister Nitin Gadkari for not paying heed to their problems. Delegations of VACF and TAS had met with senior officials and diplomats at the district and state level, but in vain, he added. 
 
 Bhalekar said a delegation of autorickshaw owners will meet chief minister Devendra Phadnis soon to highlight their demands.
