Coimbatore: Members of the Coimbatore Women Bar Association staged a protest in front of the Integrated Court Complex in the city on Tuesday, demanding justice for a minor girl who was raped and murdered by a group of men in Jammu. President of the association Thenmozhi said women were treated as second class citizens in society though they had achieved in many fields. “After Nirbhaya’s case, many amendments were implemented but crime against children and women has not reduced in the country,” said Thenmozhi. She said the government should enact strict laws. “Many minor boys were involved in rape cases. They come out from the prisons without any punishment under the Juvenile Justice Act. Amendments should be made be in this act to give maximum punishment for the minors,” said Thenmozhi. Joint secretary of the Criminal Bar Association S Elizabeth Rani said there are many laws to protect women but they are implemented properly. There is no safety for women in the country, she said.
