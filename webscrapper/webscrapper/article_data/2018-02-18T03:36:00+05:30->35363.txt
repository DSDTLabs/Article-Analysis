Nagpur: Even though the   application deadline is still 10 days away, seats in Nagpur district have been   by 165% thus setting the tone for yet another competitive year for admissions.

 As of Saturday afternoon, 11,555 applications were received for 6,993 seats. Last year too, Nagpur RTE seats were oversubscribed by almost 300%. 
 
 Though there’s more demand than supply, RTE seats still remain vacant because these statistics don’t reveal the entire picture. An education official, who is working closely with the RTE admission process, said, “Top schools in city see heavy applications while some schools are undersubscribed. For certain  , you could end up getting four applications for just one seat while there will be some schools which hardly get any applications. But when you look at the statistics in an overall point of view, then it all averages out and we see an oversubscription for everything.” 
 
 Some schools in city have decided to boycott the RTE admission process because of pending payments and that is a problem which can erupt into a crisis post the application deadline.   of almost two dozen CBSE schools in Nagpur have decided to refuse admissions along with few more schools under the state-level   ( ).
 
 Though all of these schools still reflect in the RTE admission website and parents are applying for seats, schools have decided to refuse admission at a later stage. A school trustee said, “We did not register at the RTE website, so the government auto-registered us. That’s unfair and as of now we cannot do anything about it. So best way is to wait till the actual admissions get over.”
 
 There’s a possibility of IESA executive members holding a press conference in Nagpur in the coming week to garner more support for their cause.
