CHARMINAR : The Telangana State   has sought a report from its CEO regarding the allotment of 300 shops, after an internal probe revealed that at least 100 of them at Nabi Khana Moulvi Akbar Complex in   are illegal.

 The chairman of the Telangana State Waqf Board, Mohammed Saleem, who conducted a review meeting on Saturday, said that recent inspections exposed many irregularities in the shops of Nabi Khana Maulvi Akbar as well as the Makkah Madina buildings.
  
 The Board has said it will ensure that all encroachments are removed from waqf properties and that it will chalk out a plan to provide financial assistance to needy people from the income of the Waqf board.
 
 The CEO was asked to submit a report regarding the allocation of shops at Nabi Khana Mawlvi Akbar and their current condition. The development comes in the light of allegations that some ‘selected’ people were allotted shops with the help of board officials.
 
 Social reformist Ilays Shamshi, for his part, suggests that the   chairman Mohammed Saleem is shying away from the actual scam, which he says is much bigger. "Mohammed Saleem wants to divert public attention from the issue of key waqf properties. It is learnt that during the recent survey it was found that documents of nearly a thousand properties have gone missing, but he is not in the mood to raise this issue in the meetings,” Shamshi alleged.
 
 The Board is likely to come up with a new rental agreement to increase the rent of present tenants after the submission of CEO’s report in this regard.
 
 “The purpose of generating income is to reach out to the deserving and needy people in the state. Heart patients and patients with liver problems, cancer and kidney failure would get help from Wakf funds,” said TSWB chairman Saleem.
