JAIPUR:   has asked the state chief secretary, principal secretaries of finance, health, technical education and director general of jails to be present in the court on May 11 to explain the reason for not complying with the directions issued by the court on   in the state. 

 The division bench of Justice M Rafique and VS Siradhana was hearing the suo motu petition on the pitiable conditions of jails in the state.
 
 The high court on January 27, 2016 gave 45 comprehensive and wide ranging directions to the government to improve the conditions of the jails and again on March 9 this year followed up with 16 specific directions asking the government to comply with or directed the chief secretary to be present in the court on April 7. However, neither the directions were complied with nor the chief secretary was present in the court on Thursday to explain the reasons for non-compliance prompting the court to summon all these officials during the next hearing. The court also gave liberty to amicus curie Prateek Kasliwal to move contempt of court proceedings.
 
 The CMD of Bharat Electricals Ltd which is tasked with installing mobile jammers in the jails said the jammers installed in jails have become ineffective because the authorities have not complied with the direction that no mobile towers be allowed within the 500 meters radius of the jails. He said not only the distance but even the power of the towers is four times more than the maximum capacity of 20 watts permitted. He said 57 jammers are yet to be installed in the 9 central jails in the state.
