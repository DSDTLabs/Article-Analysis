MUMBAI: A special authority will be set up to regulate parking in the city, the   told Bombay high court on Friday. 

 The BMC told this to a bench of Justices Naresh Patil and Girish Kulkarnihearing a PIL on traffic woes. The judges said there must be a law for parking like there is one for street hawking. "We need a special body... an authority to be set up under the law,'' said Justice Kulkarni.
 
 Senior advocate Anil Sakhare, who represented the BMC, then said that Development Control Regulation 2034, which is in the planning stage, has provided for a special parking authority. "It will be a different cell. It will have statutory status. An IAS officer will be heading it," he said. 
 
 The judges said it is a "good thought" to have a competent authority to regulate parking. They asked what the Centre has to say about imposing a congestion fee for vehicles coming to busy business districts. "Today, you have such a position that ambulances cannot pass," said Justice Kulkarni, referring to difficulty vehicles have to access   and   which are on congested roads. The bench also asked if people registering new vehicles are asked if they have car parking facility.
 
 The bench noted that electronic surveillance can work effectively for parking. Justice Kulkarni said systems in Japan and Singapore are satellite-linked. "Nobody would dare to violate the law,'' he said. 
 
 Justice Patil said there is a need to strengthen our technology. "Learn from the world, but apply to Indian conditions," said Justice Patil.
