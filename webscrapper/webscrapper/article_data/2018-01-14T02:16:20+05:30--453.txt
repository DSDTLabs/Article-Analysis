GURGAON:   Highways Authority of India ( ) is planning to set up a toll plaza on   expressway when it becomes operational. Even as the exact location of this toll plaza is yet to be finalised, residents are opposing any such proposal. Most of them ask why they should give toll simply to get on the expressway. 

 The toll plaza was first planned on the Haryana-Delhi border. There are several residential sectors along the Dwarka expressway. However, now it has been proposed that the toll plaza will be built in Delhi, officials said. “How can we build an expressway and not have a toll plaza? A meeting on the proposal will be held in Delhi on January 15,” an NHAI official told TOI. But residents are not happy with such a proposal. 
 
 Pradip Rahi, a member of  , said: “We cannot digest the fact that the authorities are planning to set up another toll plaza on the expressway. Till now, we have been paying toll at Kherki Daula, now another toll would come up. Why should we pay to use the expressway?” Another resident of Dwarka, Yashesh Yadav, said: “Did we buy our flats in Dwarka to pay toll each time we step out of our house? This is not happening.” Some residents demanded that they should be exempted from paying toll at Dwarka expressway. 
 
 “When the government can exempt villagers from paying toll at Kherki Daula. then why can’t they exempt us too? We will hold a massive protest against the non-completion of the Dwarka expressway and continue with it,” said a resident. “Our association will also write to NHAI and other authorities against any proposal to open a new toll on Dwarka expressway,” he added.
