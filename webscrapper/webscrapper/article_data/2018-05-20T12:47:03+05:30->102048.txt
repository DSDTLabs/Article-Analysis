PATNA: Police have finally ascertained the identity of the four youths seen raping a girl in a video that went viral a fortnight ago. The girl has also been identified, police said.

 According to Patna police zone IG  , the girl is a native of   district and the incident took place near   under the Naubatpur police station area in Patna three to four months back.
 
 Khan said the four youths belonged to Naubatpur. “Our preliminary investigations suggest the youths are daily wagers and fled to Chennai after the incident,” he said.
 
 The IG said police would soon get the girl’s statement recorded before a magistrate. “She is a married woman of 18-19 years. We are trying to find out if she is married to anyone in the video,” he said.
 
 The video surfaced only a couple of days after another   showed a minor girl being disrobed by the roadside by 13 boys, including eight minors, at Bharathua village in Jehanabad district. This video went viral on April 29, and police arrested all the accused within a week after lodging a zero FIR in the Town police station in Jehanabad.
 
 While police had identified the place of occurrence with the help of a bike’s registration number visible in the earlier video, they remained clueless about the place and people pertaining to the latest video for several days.
 
 As the dialect used by the boys in the latest video appeared to be Magahi, police lodged a zero FIR in Gaya’s   police station on May 11 and Khan alerted the SPs of 11 districts in the Patna police zone to help the Gaya police ascertain the identity of the boys and girl seen in the video.
