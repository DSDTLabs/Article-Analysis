GURUGRAM: A 37-year-old MNC executive who had gone out for a drink with her husband was allegedly molested by two men at a pub on   in the early hours of Friday. Her chartered accountant husband was also beaten up after he resisted.

 The accused have been identified as 32-year-old Avinesh Tyagi, a resident of   in UP, and 32-year-old Arvind, a resident of Sohna. They were arrested but released on bail by a city court later in the day.
 
 Police said the woman and her husband — residents of Parsvnath Exotica in Sector 53 — had gone to   bar at Two Horizon Center on Golf Course Road on Thursday night. Around 4am on Friday, one of the two men approached her for a dance.
 
 “When I refused to dance with him, he patted on my cheeks and asked me if I was married. Soon he was joined by another man and when my husband intervened, both of them started misbehaving with us. We then left the bar, but the duo followed us and hit my husband with a stone. It was then I called the cops,” the woman said in her complaint.
 
 A police team, including women cops, soon reached the spot, and nabbed Avinesh from outside the bar, while Arvind managed to escape. However, he was later arrested. Both work with a private company in Gurgaon.
 
 Based on the woman’s complaint, an FIR has been registered against the duo under sections 354 ( ), 323 (causing hurt), 34 (common intention) of IPC at Women’s police station. “The accused were produced in a city court on Friday itself and were granted bail,” said sub inspector Suman Singh, the investigating officer.
