AHMEDABAD: Thanks to the efforts of the members of an online community, ‘Dog Lovers in Ahmedabad’, seven of the 11 beagles which were released from a laboratory last month have found homes. The beagles were to be euthanized but a team of six dog lovers stepped in and took custody of the dogs. These ‘freagles’ — a sobriquet that shows they were freed from captivity — were first accommodated at a shelter in Sanand where they were acclimatized to conditions outside a lab.

 “Those willing to adopt have been thoroughly screened,” said  , one of the five volunteers who worked to have the dogs adopted. “We uploaded an online form comprising 90 questions, which the prospective adopters had to fill. All the dog parents-to-be were counselled about the care the dogs require.” The adopters were made to sign a contract, agreeing that the dogs cannot be re-homed without the team’s consent and that they will be regularly vaccinated and given due medical and personal care.
 
 “It is not easy to adopt a laboratory-rescued dog as it is incapable of doing a lot of things a normal dog will easily do,” said Richa. “Moreover, these dogs will initially be scared by comon household sounds such as that of a pressure cooker whistle and even a doorbell. It takes a lot of patience to train these dogs.” These challenges did not daunt canine lovers in the city. “I took a few days off from work because I want Bumble Bee (the dog) to get used to the house,” said Aarshin Pancholi, a city-based professional. “He is taking time to adapt. For instance, he cannot climb off the bed because he hasn’t done it before. But I am sure he will come around with love and care.”
 
 Some of adopters had dogs already. “We have three dogs but I was more than willing to help and give one of these lab-released dogs a home,” said  , an IAS officer. “I am glad it has associated well with the three other dogs.”
