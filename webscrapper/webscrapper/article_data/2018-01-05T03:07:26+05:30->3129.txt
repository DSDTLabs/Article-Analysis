MUMBAI: Dalit politician  , the grandson of B R Ambedkar, on Thursday claimed   CM   had assured him that the proposed commission of inquiry on the Koregaon-Bhima clash would be empowered to award sentences to the culprits. However, Fadnavis was noncommittal on the issue. 

 Fadnavis had on Tuesday ordered a judicial probe into Monday’s Koregaon-Bhima episode. According to the provisions of the Commission of Inquiry Act, while the panel does have limited powers under the Indian Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code, it has none to award sentences. 
 
 “The commission has powers to recommend, but the recommendations cannot be enforced. It is for the government to take a decision on the recommendations,” a senior bureaucrat said. Fadnavis confirmed to TOI that a delegation led by Ambedkar did met him and submitted a memorandum demanding the arrest of certain people. 
 
 “We have taken note of his demand. My view is that the law will take its own course,” added Fadnavis, who said the commission would be headed by a sitting Bombay high court judge will head the commission. Ambedkar said the CM had accepted his demand to punish culprits. 
 
 “I have warned the chief minister that if stern action is not taken, the situation will go beyond the control of the government. The CM has agreed to grant powers under the CrPC to the commission. As a result, its recommendations will be binding on the government,” Ambedkar, who has issued a call for Maharashtra bandh, said.
