CHENNAI:   assembly on Friday witnessed heated exchanges between the treasury and opposition benches over salary hike for MLAs, with DMK leader   opposing the move strongly. Stalin said his legislators were ready to credit their hike in salary to the chief minister's relief fund until the crisis in the transport corporations were settled. 

 He was participating in the debate on Payment of Salaries (Amendment) Bill for salary hike of MLAs, that increased the monthly salary and other allowances to 1.05 lakh from 55,000. "The 100% hike is needless when the state is reeling under financial crisis. You have admitted the poor finances of the state in governor's address and in the budget. The government has to re-think about revising the monthly pay to MLAs, given the transport department's struggle to meet its finances. We have to set an example," the leader said.   legislature party leader K Ramasamy too expressed his party's opposition.
 
 Deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam intervened to say that the revision was warranted due to the requests from the legislators. The successive governments in the past had resorted to such moves based on the demand. "Having said that, I want to remind that our salary is far less than nine states in the country. When the announcement was made in July last, they (opposition) did not express any views, and why now? All for political gains," the deputy CM said. 
 
 Meanwhile, MLAs, who do not want salary hike, can give their increased salary amount to the chief minister's relief fund, said municipal administration minister S P Velumani. He also blamed DMK for doing politics over the salary hike.
