MANGALURU: With some private schools commencing admission process before government notification, Federation of the   (Padi) has approached the deputy commissioner to stall admissions which is violation of Karnataka Education Act.

 The association has recently submitted a memorandum to K G Jagadeesha, deputy commissioner of Dakshina Kannada and stated that ignoring the rules, pre-primary and high schools have commenced their admission process.
 
 “The move is a total violation of Karnataka Education Act, 1983. Adding to it, before admission, all the schools have to mandatorily install a board displaying certain information about institution that includes licence, fee structure but none of these have been followed by them,” alleged Renny D’Souza, director   (Padi) said.
 
 However, there will be several changes in the yet to release notification and one of the key factors is revision of fee structure. “It is illegal to admit children without following the revised fee structure,” he added. “Apart from it, government only decides the calendar of event for the upcoming academic year but some schools have flouted this rule as well.”
 
 According to sources,  , DC, after receiving the memorandum from the association has planned to hold a joint meeting with school authorities, DDPI, associations and others at the earliest.
 
 Walter H D’Mello, DDPI, DK declined to comment on the issue.
