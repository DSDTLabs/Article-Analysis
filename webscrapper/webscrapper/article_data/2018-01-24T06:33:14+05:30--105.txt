JALANDHAR: After a clip of Shiromani Gurudwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal’s speech of January 21 went viral, in which he misquoted a line from Gurbani, Guru Granth Sahib Satkaar Committee has submitted a complaint to   (rural) police for registering a case against him for hurting religious sentiments.

 The complainants have alleged that as the SGPC president failed to give any clarification or apologize for such a blunder, it appeared that he was unrepentant and the distortion was deliberate.
 
 With their complaint submitted to Jalandhar (rural) senior superintendent of police (SSP),   head Sukhjit Singh Khose and other Sikh activists also attached a video clip of Longowal’s speech made during a religious function at Takht Damdama Sahib in   on January 21 that was telecast live.
 
 They said the speech had gone viral and they had waited for Longowal to clarify but till date there was no word from him or any other senior functionary of the SGPC on the issue. “It is clear that it is deliberate and he cares two hoots, though distorting Gurbani is considered a big sin in the Sikh faith,” they said.
 
 They also pointed out that Longowal was member of the SGPC for a long time. The complainants also cited an anecdote from Sikh history in which seventh Sikh Guru excommunicated his kin from the faith after he distorted Gurbani to please the ruler of the time.
 
 They have urged the police to register a case under Section 295A (for hurting religious sentiments) of the IPC.
 Longowal was not available for comments as his mobile phone remained switched off.
