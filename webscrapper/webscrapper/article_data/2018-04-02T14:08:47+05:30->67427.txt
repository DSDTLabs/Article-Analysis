PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has upheld the life imprisonment meted out by a trial court to a man for killing his wife after suspecting her character. 

 The case of the prosecution was that on September 12, 2014,   Naik from Fatorpa murdered wife,  , by stabbing her in the stomach and slitting her throat with a knife. The prosecution alleged that Jayesh sustained injuries while committing the crime. 
 
 In his defence, Jayesh stated that Vaishali was murdered by another man while he went to drop his two minor children to school. On returning home, he heard a noise, he said, and ran inside to see his wife being murdered. Jayesh said he was falsely arrested and implicated in the crime, thus challenging the order of the trial court in the high court. A division bench comprising justices   and   observed that the testimony of Archana, a panch witness, demonstrated that she was the first person to hear Vaishali’s screams. The bench said the witness also saw Vaishali’s blood-stained hands as well as her lying in a pool of blood, from a window in her house. 
 
 The high court also noted that Jayesh was the last person seen in the compant of his wife, and that his defence that he had seen someone else assaulting his wife was found to be false.
 
  The court observed that Jayesh’s case, that he had not sustained any injuries, was a false defence carved out by him. 
 
 It said that it was for him to explain the presence of injuries on his person, particularly the “incised wounds with clean cut margin”.
 
 The high court stated that the sessions judge, on considering the evidence brought on record, found that the accused running away from the scene of the crime was a relevant circumstance against him.
