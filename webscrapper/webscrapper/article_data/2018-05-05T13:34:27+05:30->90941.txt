COIMBATORE: Alleging that there was a conspiracy to frame DMK men in the illegal gutka manufacturing unit case, DMK working president MK   on Friday warned senior police officers of action when the party comes to power.

 While leading an agitation in front of the South Taluk office here to condemn the AIADMK government for registering cases against DMK functionaries for staging protest in front of the illegal gutka manufacturing unit at Kannampalayam, Stalin said it was an attempt to settle political scores. He singled out Coimbatore rural SP Pa Moorthy. “Moorthy is toeing the line dictated by AIADMK ministers by trying to frame DMK men in the illegal gutka unit case. He will face severe action when DMK comes to power,” he said.
 
 “Moorthy was the SP in Pudukkottai district, from where health minister C Vijaya Baskar hails. We have enough evidence to prove links between Vijaya Baskar and Moorthy,” Stalin said insinuating that Moorthy was acting at the behest of Vijaya Baskar. 
 
 Once DMK comes to power, we will bring to book AIADMK leaders and police officers involved in this conspiracy,” he said. He later visited the   and met the seven arrested DMK functionaries.
 
 Addressing media after the protest, Stalin said that DGP TK Rajendran, minister Vijaya Baskar and retired IPS officer George will soon face legal action in the gutka scam. “The DMK government will arrest Moorthy for helping Vijaya Baskar,” he said.
 
 Moorthy was not available for comment.
