While we all want to make our home attractive, it is mainly the living room that gets the maximum attention when it comes to  . Bedrooms are often ignored since major portion of the room is occupied by the bed. However, apart from the bed there are other things; a soft rug, mattresses,  , adequate storage space, which make for an impeccable bedroom. So, even though your   may not always feel like you are walking into a well-made hotel room, you can avoid some mistakes and replicate the same look at home. Here’s how to avoid making decorating mistakes while doing up your bedroom.

 
 
 Don’t think you have the bedroom only to rest and sleep. Have different lights in the bedroom; so you have reading lights at the bedside, and overhead lighting with dimmers, which can set the mood.
 
 
 Most of the times you will see artwork on the walls of the living room or at the dining area, while the bedroom walls remain bare. Pay attention to these walls, too, and put up prominent artwork here since you sleep and wake up in your bedroom. Isn’t that enough incentive to make these walls attractive?
 
 
 It is advisable to use calm pastel colours instead of dark or bright colours, which might hurt the eye. Naturally cool colours also create a serene environment making the room look more inviting.
 
  
 Completely avoid cluttering the bedroom and allow it to have open spaces. Have adequate storage facilities and remove unnecessary things that have been lying around. While making things organised, it will also make the room more breathable.
 
 
 Getting the bedding wrong is the worst mistake, since we spend a lot of our time on our beds. Invest in some nice linens, which are of good quality that will look good as well as help you sleep better. Also, avoid 
 having too many pillows on your bed. Use a comfortable pillow for sleeping and when it comes to decorative pillows, avoid piling up too many of them on the bed.
