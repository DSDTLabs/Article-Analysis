 (NORTH DINAJPUR): A young woman from   crossed the barricade, ran past the D-zone set up by police for   security, and made it to a dais from where chief minister Mamata Banerjee was addressing a rally at Hemtabad. The CM noticed the woman when she crawled close to her feet and started weeping. Mamata swiftly stepped aside, turned back and gave a drubbing to the men on dais for the security breach. 

 "   ki? Ki bhabe holo? Ki kore uthe elo ekhane? (What's this? How did it happen? How could she make it here)," said Mamata on stage while a woman constable dragged the woman off the dais. A clamour within the D-zone also caught the chief minister's attention where police had stopped the woman's sister who was making a vain attempt to reach the dais. "Do you now realise that there are loopholes?" the CM slammed the security personnel, throwing police into a tizzy. 
 
 The two sisters -   and Amera from Karandighi's village - had tried to meet the chief minister during her last two public meetings at at Malda and Gangarampur too, but failed. 
 
 On Thursday, there was high drama on the dais with DM Ayesha Rani, MLA Amal Acharya, and senior police officers rushing towards the woman as she came close to the chief minister, baring the security lapse. The DM told the CM that this woman had come to her before and the administration did its best to help the family. "This is not done. This family has got a home under the Gitanjali scheme and this woman's brother has got a job. Now they want some more from us," the CM said.
 
 The two sisters however, didn't come to the CM for dole. They had been moving from pillar to post to get the culprits, who killed their father three years ago, arrested. "My father was killed in 2015. We have been seeking justice since then," Rabeya said, holding a piece of paper in her hand.
 
 DGP Surajit Kar Purkayastha and DG (security) held a meeting on Thursday's security breach and will submit a report next week.
