Mumbai: While institutes of excellence are taking measures to increase research and development activities on campuses, Mumbai University’s   seem to have achieved little on that front. The number of   filed by the departments, excluding affiliated colleges, in the last three years has been declining, data submitted to the central government’s National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) showed. While 39 were filed in 2013, the number dropped to zero in 2015. Even if 52 patents were filed in three years, not one was granted or published. Last year, the   did not participate in the ranking process; this year, the data submitted reflected poor performance in some research-related parameters.

 The data was compiled by the Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) by taking details from the departments as NIRF seeks information only from the varsity’s physical campus. “Not all departments, such as humanities and social sciences, are into heavy research from the viewpoint of filing patents. Some faculties have good published papers too,” said IQAC head Neeraj Hatekar. But this cannot be an excuse for fewer patents or PhDs, he added. “The UGC system of evaluating teachers is faulty. Teachers are assessed on their APIs (academic performance indicators). If some teachers are good at research, their work should be promoted. If some are good at teaching, they should be encouraged accordingly. One cannot uniformly assess teachers,” said Hatekar.
 
 Some figures from departments, which did not seem authentic, have not been included in the compilation process, said an official. Vijay Joshi, in-charge co-ordinator for the faculty of science, said the numbers of patents filed by colleges could be on the higher side. “There could be more patents filed in the departments too. Also, not all patents that come to the scrutiny committee have patentable content, and therefore are rejected, as filing patents involves heavy costs. The process has been simplified but few are aware of it. Many incentives are offered now and students and teachers should make use of them. The university funds patents if they are good,” added Joshi.
 
 The number of   students graduating from the university is also declining; close to 400 PhD students graduated in 2013 but the numbers declined by 22% to 303 in 2015. A college principal said research centres were almost not active in 2015 after the academic bodies were dissolved and not many research projects were approved. But these numbers will reflect at a later stage. “Many faculty members whose posts are not approved are younger and are pursuing PhDs. The university will have to focus more on promoting research activities among students and faculty members. Some affiliated colleges are doing well in terms of research,” said the principal.
