MUMBAI: State’s initiative to arrest school drop-out rates by using selfies of students in classes failed to take off even on the second Monday of the month as teachers across the state protested against the scheme . 

 The protesting teachers’ associations listed reasons ranging from having to spend money from their own pockets, poor mobile network to teaching hours being wasted to run the scheme. They added that making it mandatory was not only   but also illegal. 
 
 Member of legislative council Kapil Patil said, “Teachers say it is more important to teach students than taking selfies.” 
 
 However, minister of state education Vinod Tawde slammed teachers’ associations.
