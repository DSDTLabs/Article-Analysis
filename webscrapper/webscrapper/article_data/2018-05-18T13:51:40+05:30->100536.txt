JAIPUR: Rajasthan Pradesh   Committee (RPCC) staged a dharna at the collectorate to protest alleged ‘strangling of democracy’ in Karnataka where the governor invited BJP leader B S Yaddyurapa to form government despite his party lacking majority in the assembly. 

 Continuing its protest on the issue and acting on a call given by the AICC, the   would observe Friday as “Save Democracy” day, stage sit-ins and hold meetings at all district headquarters in the state. 
 
 The agitated Congress workers burned the effigy of Prime Minister   here on Thursday. Addressing the meeting, RPCC president   said the way the popular mandate was scuttled in Karnataka is not only condemnable but also shameful. He said, “Now it has become clear that the BJP’s priority is to remain in power by any means. BJP will not hesitate to even tamper with the constitution to grab power.”
 
 Pilot said, “India is the largest democracy in the world and its constitution is respected all over the world. But some forces are trying to inflict damage to the constitution.”
 
 The Congress leader said in Goa, Manipur and Mizoram his party emerged as the single largest party but the governor invited BJP-led post-poll coalition to form governments there. “On the contrary, in Karnataka despite the Congress and the JD(S) commanding absolute majority, the single largest party BJP was invited to form government,” Pilot said.
 
 He said the “real face of BJP” has been exposed by its double speak and actions and this was reflected in its decreasing vote percentage wherever voting has been held in recent past. Pilot said BJP could not accept its defeat and is misusing all the government and administrative machinery to undermine democracy in the country. Congress city president Pratap Singh Khachariyawas, ex-MPs Mahesh Joshi and Ashq Ali, ex-minister Brij Kishore Sharma, vice-president Archana Sharma and general secretary Sangeeta Garg, were among those present at the protest.
