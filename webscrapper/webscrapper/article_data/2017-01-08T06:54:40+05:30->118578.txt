JODHPUR: Councillors and   of the   (JMC) are on war path following allegation on two councillors for demanding money from the sanitary inspectors.

 After a heated arguments between the two on Friday and Saturday, wherein both the sides demanded action against each other by the mayor, a sanitation inspector and president of   Rajesh Teji were suspended by the mayor on Saturday.
 
 Mayor said in its order of suspension that no   against the public representative would be tolerated.
 
 Threatening the councillors, sanitary staff had said that if the illegal demand from councillors did not stop, they will blacken the face of the councillors demanding money and if no action was taken by the mayor against them, they will go for “jhadoo down” strike.
 
 Before this, the mayor had initiated investigation into the allegations of the sanitary inspectors against the councillors refusing to honour the demand of none without investigation.
 
 If this step of suspension leads the sanitary staff to go on strike, preparations by the administration to keep the city clean, specially in the wake of the cleanliness survey and visit of the chief minister on the Republic Day, will be badly hit.
