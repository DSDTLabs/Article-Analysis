KOLKATA: The mint crossing at   has turned into a nightmare for  ,   manning it. A day after a man was killed after a lamp post — knocked down by a bus — fell on him on Thursday morning, the spot continues to be unsafe for several reasons.

 
 
  
 
 
 To carve out a bus bay, the wide pavement in front of the mint was narrowed down. This has left the trees, lamp posts and even the bus passenger shelter, which were earlier on the pavement, on the carriageway. On Thursday, the bus hit three such lamp posts one after another.
 
 The passenger shelter at mint, which was earlier along the sidewalk, now protrudes on the bus bay forcing vehicles to swerve right sharply. “This may cause accident any time,” a cop said. The bus bay itself is uneven — the left side is fiveinch deep causing the buses to slant as they enter, immediately after descending from Taratala flyover.
 
 After the flyover’s construction, the traffic chaos at Taratala intersection shifted to the 150m stretch in front of mint making it the busiest crossing on DH Road. The crossing is constantly fed by vehicles from elevated roads on either side — Majherhat rail over bridge and the flyover. Thus, any disruption on the stretch leads to a complete chock-a-block of DH Road. Fearing this, vehicles often try to rush along the stretch, putting pedestrians at risk.
 
 The absence of signage and fading zebra crossing confuse motorists. “After 4pm, the right turn from   to Majherhat bridge is not allowed due to rise in south-bound vehicles. But there is no signage informing the same. So you wait at the signal only to be scolded by a cop and asked to take the service road instead and then take a U-turn to access the bridge from west,” said  , a local resident.
