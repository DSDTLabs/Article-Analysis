NOIDA: Those 12 hours were the most difficult time for businessman   Gupta who was   in Bulandshahr on Friday. On Saturday, Gupta visited the SP (rural)’s office in Greater Noida thanked the policemen for rescuing him. 

 Narrating the horrific experience, he admitted that he did not do a background check of the two drivers – Sanesh and Pawan – which was a mistake.
 
 “Sanesh was introduced to me by a friend. He quit the job in two months saying he wanted to become a crorepati. But I never expected that he would plot my   to get rich,” Gupta told TOI.
 
 He said that when his driver Pawan took a wrong route he suspected that something was wrong. “But I believed him thinking that he is taking a shorter route. Soon I realised that I was kidnapped. I understood Pawan’s role in the plot when the two kidnappers started talking to him in a familiar manner after taking me hostage,” Gupta said.
 
 “The two criminals told Pawan to drive to the spot where they had visited last week. I realised that all the three criminals knew the place where they were heading to,” he said. He said that Sanesh had not met him during the entire episode.
 
 The businessman said that the criminals had locked the doors and windows of the car. “Whenever I saw some policemen on the road, I tried to scream for help and also waved my hands. However, the criminals warned me to keep quiet and put my head down the window,” he said.
