BENGALURU: As work on Reach 6 of  , linking Gottigere-Swagath Road Cross and part of the Gottigere-Nagawara line, has begun, traffic police are asking road users in southern and south-eastern Bengaluru to use alternative routes. 

  The 7.5-km elevated stretch is part of the 21.42-km Gottigere-Nagawara line. 
 
  Mico Layout traffic police said due to Metro work, movement of traffic has slowed down opposite Apollo and   hospitals and IIM on  . Construction material installed in the middle of the road is making it difficult for two heavy vehicles to move at a time in one direction, road users said. However, traffic police say the problem is not as bad as is being made out. "Since the road is 100 ft wide, we're not facing that much of a problem. Except during peak hours, traffic is moving normally. During peak hours, the speed drops from 20 kmph to 15 kmph," traffic police said.
