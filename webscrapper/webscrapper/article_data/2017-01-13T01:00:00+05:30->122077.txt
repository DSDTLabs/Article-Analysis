It’s a big irony of the small screen. While producers   and   are at loggerheads, with both wanting to make the fantasy show 'Chandrakanta', the latter has finalised the actress who will topline his project. And it’s none other than Ekta’s find,  . 
Kritika clarifies, “I had no clue about two producers working on the same subject. I realised it only when I saw both the teasers on the internet. Ekta has given me memorable shows and I am still remembered as Arohi from ' '. The rivalry could be between the channels or the production houses, but not between Ekta and me. We are friends and I’m sure she would be happy for me. Also, the fact that there are two shows will make the competition interesting. In the end, good content will win the audience’s heart. Having said that, I want both the shows to do well.”
 What made the actress give her nod to the project? “I have never been part of a costume drama before. I have watched the first 'Chandrakanta' as a child, but nostalgia isn’t the reason I am taking it up. I found the script interesting. The central character is not only a beautiful woman, but she’s also a fighter and has a sense of purpose,” she answers.
 Kritika, who was last seen opposite   in 'Reporters' almost a year-and-a-half ago, has started preparing for the part. “I am on detox. I want to be in good shape, be healthy and have good 
 skin. The look is very important and I need to look believable as a princess,” she signs off.
