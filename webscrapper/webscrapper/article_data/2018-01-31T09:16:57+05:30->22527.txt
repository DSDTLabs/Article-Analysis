HYDERABAD: Telangana government registered a 17% growth in State Owned Tax Revenue even post introduction of GST, and will continue to register higher growth rate in coming years, state finance minister   said. He said the state recorded 21.5% growth in 2016-17 financial year.

 Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, the finance minister said the government has been achieving good results due to policies such as Ease of Doing Business (EODB) and other investor-and industry-friendly measures. Nearly 3,000 new firms have come forward to set up industries with an investment of ₹1.15 lakh crore, the minister said, and added the state GSDP rate is higher than the national average.
 
 The finance minister said he had urged the Centre to allocate more funds to the state under Centrally-sponsored schemes. “The state government sought ₹19,000 crore for  , ₹5,000 crore for Mission Kakatiya, at least ₹10,000 crore for the   irrigation project, which is being taken up at a cost of ₹88,000 crore. The government also sought budget allocations for tribal university, horticulture university, Kazipet railway coach factory, Bayyaram steel plant and   proposed in the state. But there has been no response from the Centre. The government is still hopeful of getting funds,” Etela said.
 
 In the current budget, the state government spent much more than allocations for targeted schemes such as Mission Bhagiratha, 24x7 power supply for agriculture and Kaleshwaram irrigation project, the finance minister said, adding these would be completed before deadline. Principal secretary of finance   was also present at the meet.
