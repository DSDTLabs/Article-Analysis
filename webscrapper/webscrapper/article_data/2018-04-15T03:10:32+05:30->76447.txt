THANE: Celebrity lawyer Rizwan   has refuted the allegations of Thane police about his role in the illegal procurement of call data records (CDR) for  . 

 Siddique said his role in the Ayesha Shroff case was limited to only filing two FIRs.
 
 Siddique, who was arrested by the crime branch, was released after the high court rapped Thane   and held the police had acted in a "high-handed" manner and had failed to follow "due process of law". 
 
 The high court had directed senior officials of the Thane police and the state home department to carry out a departmental enquiry.
 
 But the crime branch challenged the high court order in apex court, which stayed the departmental inquiry against the police officer and asked him to file his reply matter within four weeks.
 
 Subsequently, the crime branch, earlier this week claimed they had taken down the statement of Ayesha Shroff. Siddique's name cropped up again, reportedly for procuring the CDR of another Bollywood actor, Sahil Khan.
 
 Siddique told TOI the police were trying to fabricate a case against him and conduct a media trial. "I was not representing Ayesha Shroff in the bail applications filed before the court as the same were not in my area of practice. All allegations levied in the media against me personally, which concern any alleged CDR of Sahil Khan, is absolutely false and baseless. and the Crime Branch's only motive is to intentionally conduct a trial by media through speculation and rumours and to damage my reputation," said Siddique. 
 
 When contacted, crime branch officials refused to comment on Siddique's allegations.
