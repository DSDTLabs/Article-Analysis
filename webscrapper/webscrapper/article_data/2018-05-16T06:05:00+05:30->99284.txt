Kolkata: Ice cream maker   is embarking on an expansion plan by unveiling a series of new flavours based on traditional and iconic sweets of Bengal.

 Rollick which produces 56,000 litres of ice cream per day from its own plant in Howrah and a franchise factory in Ranchi aims to double its output by the end of next year. “Besides Bengal, we want to spread wings in the markets of Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, Assam, Chhattisgarh and seven states of northeast. By the next year, we will produce 1 lakh litre of ice cream every day. Our Desi range like Rabdi, Kulfi, Paan, Daab Malai and Nolen Gur can make a mark,” said  , director, Rollick Ice Cream.
 
 Being a mass-market player for the last 30 years, Rollick seeks to keep itself positioned in the price range of Rs 5 to Rs 40 for per unit of ice cream. The other major players in this category are: Amul, Cream Bell, Mother Dairy and Walls (among national players) and Kamal’s and Coolfi (the local players).
 
 “We never compromise on quality as we play on high volume and value for money. The demand is growing as our sales geography is getting wider,” said Aggarwal, a second generation businessman of the ice-cream maker family.
 
 The frozen dessert major has seen a 25% sales growth in 2017-18 over the last fiscal and has targeted to make it 40% in 2018-19. The company is expanding its 350-strong dealer network to 600 by the end of this year.
 
 The number of Rollick’s hand-pulled carts will also be increased to 1,000 by 2018-end from the current figure of 500. “We are quite visible in the rural Bengal. But from now, we will enter the Kolkata market in a more competitive manner,” she added.
 
 Rollick, which has 10 ice cream parlours in Kolkata, will set up at least one ice parlour in each town of Bengal. “Our target is to build 10 parlours a month,” Aggarwal said. The company also plans to come up with ice cream-making workshops, ice cream-eating competitions and even ice cream-themed birthday parties .
