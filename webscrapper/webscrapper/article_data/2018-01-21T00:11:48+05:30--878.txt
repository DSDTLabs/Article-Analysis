Chennai: Two months after income tax department searches on   Golden Distilleries Private Limited led to its bank accounts being frozen, the firm has resumed supply of liquor to the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited ( ). 

 "With the distilleryâ€™s accounts being frozen in the wake of the searches, it could not remit the excise duty which was mandatory for deliveries. The supplies resumed a week back after the duty was paid," a Tasmac official told TOI. 
 
 Midas, which is linked to close relatives of sidelined AIADMK leader V K  , was searched by income tax sleuths on November 9 and again on December 27. 
 
 The Padappai-based firm is one of 11 distilleries from which Tasmac procures liquor. Tasmac officials said nearly 10 lakh cases of IMFL were procured from Midas every month over the last six years, accounting for 15% of the total Tasmac inventory.
