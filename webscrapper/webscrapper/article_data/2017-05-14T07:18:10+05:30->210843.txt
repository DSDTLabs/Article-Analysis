 "However, now we are going to implement it and this aims to groom the efficient officers to the IAS standards," he said.
 
 "There were oppositions from some corners without knowing the reality, but the government will not abandon the project just because of this, and will implement it with will power," he said.
 
 Those who are unable to obstruct the activities of the government are creating a smokescreen saying that nothing is happening here but the LDF government has no intention to gain the support of those who oppose the decisions of the government and it will go ahead with the plans, he said.
 
 "The entire civil service was dissatisfied during the   rule but the scenario has changed over the past one year as the LDF government took measures to clean the system," he added.
 
 However, there are efforts from some vested interests who spread canards saying that there is widespread discontent among the IAS officers and they do not execute the government orders, but such stories will not make any impact, said Vijayan.
 
 "None of the IAS officers are against the government and the government functions as per the rules and regulations," he said, adding that the government, from its experience, cannot agree with the allegations that there is deliberate delay on the part of the officers in implementing government orders.
 
 As part of the effort to make the government services more accessible to people and also make it corruption-free, the government is planning to use the potential of the science and technology in a better way, the CM said.
