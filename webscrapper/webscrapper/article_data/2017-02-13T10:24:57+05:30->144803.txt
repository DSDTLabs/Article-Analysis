BHAGALPUR: Bhagalpur SSP   has suspended two station house officers (SHOs) for their failure to check illegal mining under their respective jurisdictions.

 The suspended SHOs –   of Jagdishpur police station and   of Sajour police station – have been asked to report to police line while   and   have been made new SHOs of the two police stations, respectively. 
 
 At a recent crime review meeting, the SSP had taken the SHOs of Jagdishpur and Sajour police stations to task for illegal sand mining under their respective jurisdictions. However, the illegal trade continued unabated. A police team led by DSP (law and order) conducted a joint raid along with mining officials on Friday night and seized several sand-laden trucks, tractors, mechanised excavators and JCBs from dry riverbeds under Jagdishpur and Sajour police station areas.
 
 “Action has been taken against the two SHOs to send a message to other police officers in the district that any slackness on their part in reining in sand mafia will not be tolerated,” the SSP said, adding that the crackdown against illegal sand mining would continue in the district.
