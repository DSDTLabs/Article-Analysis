KOLKATA: In one of the largest gold hauls at Kolkata airport, the   (DRI) has seized 54kg semi-finished gold jewellery worth Rs16 crore at Kolkata airport on Wednesday evening. Even the   sleuths were surprised by the volume of seizure. Three persons belonging to the same family have been arrested.

 Investigations revealed the trio, part of a syndicate, have so far illegally diverted gold jewellery worth Rs 150 crore.
 
 
  
 
 The father-son duo, who have a jewellery business in Hyderabad, had developed a way to evade taxes and sell gold illegally in domestic market. The third person is a cousin of the son. All three have been remanded in 14 days jail custody.
 
 On Wednesday, the son was booked on an   flight to Dubai. He reached the airport in time, collected the boarding pass from the check-in desk at the international terminal and proceeded for customs clearance for the jewellery he was carrying. He then got the papers verified and the semi-finished jewellery sealed by customs officials.
 
 “If anyone carries jewellery for exports, it has to be carried as hand luggage and not in cargo,” a customs official explained. Soon, he skipped the immigration and slipped out of the international terminal. Kolkata airport, which has an integrated terminal with domestic and international wings in the same building, passengers are allowed to exit with the airline’s consent if he or she has not completed immigration formalities. After he exited, he exchanged the bag with his father. During interrogation, sleuths found the duo was following a unique modus operandi to evade duty. If a jeweller exports merchandise, the person is eligible to get an import duty exemption.
