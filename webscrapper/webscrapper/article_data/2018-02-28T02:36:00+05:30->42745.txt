Vijayawada: Krishna district has been reporting a slow but steady increase in   footfall compared to previous years, say officials.

 While the tourist   in 2016 was 25 per cent more than that in 2017, officials say the steep rise in 2016 was due to the Krishna Pushkarams held that year, and add that if 2016 is taken out of the equation, the footfall in the district has been showing a substantial increase over the years.
 
 Speaking to TOI, principal secretary of the tourism department, Mukesh Kumar Meena, said Krishna and Vizag districts have bagged the lion’s share of tourist footfall to the state, and are witnessing a rapid increase in footfall.
 
 “In the case of Krishna district, there is a lot of activity such as business conferences to high-level meetings as it is the capital region. It is similar in Vizag as well, as the IT presence and famous tourist spots continue to attract domestic visitors consistently,” Mukesh Kumar told TOI. 
 
 The officials are looking to increase the footfalls in the district by improving facilities in religious destinations and capitalising the niche tourism in Vizag and Konaseema. “We are putting our main focus in three different destinations which are Tirupati, Krishna and Vizag. Around 45 per cent of footfalls are in these three destinations,” Meena observed. 
 
 Since the capital region was announced in Guntur and Krishna district regions, domestic tourism has witnessed a tremendous increase. Officials also pointed out that religious tourism is no longer restricted to temples alone as the Buddhist circuit in Guntur and Krishna district region also began playing a role. 
 
 Several Buddhist leaders and disciples have been visiting the big stupa in Amaravathi village. 
 
 Under the Prasad scheme, the tourism department also proposed the government of India to sanction Rs 50 crore each for developmental works at Lord Venkateswara temple in Tirupati, Mallikarjuna temple in Srisailam and Ahobilam in Kurnool.
