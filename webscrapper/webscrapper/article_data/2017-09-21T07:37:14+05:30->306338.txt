KOZHIKODE: Prosecution in the case related to the   in Kasaragod has decided to raise the demand for invoking   (UAPA) against the accused once again. The government has unheeded the demand though the relatives of the   and the members of the mosque committee had approached the chief minister shortly after the murder.

 Muhammad Riyaz alias Riyaz Moulavi, the madrassa teacher at the mosque at Choori in Kasaragod, was murdered inside the mosque on March 21, 2017, allegedly by RSS men. Three RSS activists -- Ajesh, Nithin and Akhikesh -- were arrested a few days after the murder. The move is taken against the backdrop of the acquittal of the accused in majority of communal   cases in Kasaragod. 
 
 “The accused in the Muhammad Sinan case were acquitted because of the faults on the part of the investigating officers. Accused in the murder of Rishad were also acquitted in the same way in 2013. We do not want similar things to happen in the Moulavi case,” said advocate C Shukkur, who will be assisting the prosecution in the case.
 
 “The case will come up before the court on October 17 for framing the charges,” he said.
