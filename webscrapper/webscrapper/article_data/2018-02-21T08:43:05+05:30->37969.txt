Chandigarh: The   special court in Chandigarh on Tuesday acquitted former Srinagar DSP   in the infamous   and Kashmir sex scandal case. The court acquitted him under Section 376 of the Ranbir Penal Code (Jammu and Kashmir has its own special penal code), Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act and section 67 of the Information and Technology Act. 

 He had been accused of sexually exploiting a minor for money via a brothel run by prime accused Sabeena and her husband in 2004. However, the victim turned hostile in court and did not support the prosecution's case. The court declared her hostile and acquitted Mir on Tuesday.
 
 Interestingly, name of then J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah had also surfaced in the case, which led to him resigning from the post in July 2009. The J&K governor had eventually rejected his resignation.
 
  The 2006 scandal had hit headlines after the J&K police discovered two video CDs showing Kashmiri women being sexually exploited. The police questioned two women, including the prosecutrix and the alleged kingpin, Sabeena. After questioning them, the police had gathered names of 56 people allegedly involved in the scandal.
 
 The case was transferred to the CBI in May 2006 after that names of two J&K ministers, MLAs and other influential men emerged. The Supreme Court shifted the trial to Chandigarh in the same year. The FIR claimed Mir was one of the customers of Sabeena's residence-cum-brothel in Srinagar. He was then serving as DSP in Srinagar.
