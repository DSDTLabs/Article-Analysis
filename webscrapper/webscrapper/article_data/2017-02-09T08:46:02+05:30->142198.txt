PUNE: The wish to use high-end smart phones and ride scooters like his friends landed a 13-year-old schoolboy in the soupe, as police detained him on Tuesday.

 A Sinhagad Road police team, led by senior inspector Vishnu Jagtap, detained the boy from Dhayari after noticing the minor riding the scooter. During questioning, he narrated his story and admitted to have had stolen five smart phones from the Dhayari area.
 
 Sub-inspector   said the boy was a Standard VII student of a Sinhagad Road school. His mother is a housewife. "The boy wanted to use costly smartphones as he saw his friends use them," Sonawane said.
 
 About two months ago, he had gone for a haircut to a saloon in Dhayari. "He picked up the saloon owner's smart phone and began using it. This made him confident and he lifted a few more phones," Sonawane said.
 
 The boy had given a stolen phone to his father and another to his brother. "Shockingly though, both of them used the phones without even asking him where he got them," Sonawane said. He said the boy stole a brand new scooter from Sinhagad Road. "The owner, Sagar Kolhe, had parked the vehicle on the road to go to a shop. He had not removed the key from the scooter's boot. Before Kolhe returned, the boy fled with the scooter," Sonawane said.
 
 According to police, the boy had destroyed the registration papers of the scooter and changed its number. "We grew suspicious after noticing the duplicate number and the minor rider," Sonawane said.
