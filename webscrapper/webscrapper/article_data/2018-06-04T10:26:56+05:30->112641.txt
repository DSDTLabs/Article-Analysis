PANAJI: Around 2.4 lakh students from Class I to XII in over 2,000 schools in Goa will return to school on Monday when the new academic year 2018-19 begins.

 
 Director of education GP Bhat said that teacher rationalization in government schools has also been carried out to meet the teacher shortage that has arisen due to many retirements in the last few years. The existing teachers have been redistributed in schools till new recruitment take place.
 
 
 “The midday meal menu will see no change as of now. The same women’s self-help groups will continue to supply the meals,” Bhat said.
 
 
 After the traffic congestion experienced on the first day of school at the Cujira school complex during the last academic year, Panaji MLA Sidharth Kuncalienker said on Sunday that this year adequate arrangements have been made for smooth traffic flow at the Integrated School Complex, Cujira and at Mala.
 
 
 "I request parents and students to co-operate with the authorities to ensure a wonderful start for our children."
 
 
 Meanwhile, the markets across Goa were flooded with parents making purchases for the new academic year.
 
 
 “Students of all age groups are currently purchasing rainwear, bags and accessories to go back to school from us,” said a busy shopowner Kedar Manerker in Panaji.
