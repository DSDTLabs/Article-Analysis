PANAJI: The phase prior to the last lap of summer is likely to continue at almost the same level, with the maximum temperature hovering around 35.0C and minimum at 27.0C.

 Light or moderate showers are also mostly unlikely during the next five days. “The   is likely to be largely dry, as no phenomenon or system is seen building up so far,” M L Sahu, director, meteorological centre, Altinho said.
 
 The conditions are likely to become favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon into some more parts of the   after three days. But, this will not have any impact on the state. 
 
 The mercury has been hovering during the day at over 34C, barely a degree more than normal, during the last few days. It has risen to above 35 C only on a couple of occasions during the last 10 days. Timely setting in of sea breezes by mid-morning brings relief from the heat.
 
 The minimum temperature has been hovering around 27.0C for some time. “The same trend will continue mostly for the next five days,” Sahu said.
 
 The sky is likely to be partly cloudy due to heating of the earth during day time. “But showers are unlikely for the next few days,” Sahu said.
