SHIMLA:   chief minister Jai Ram   launched a free bike   service in Shimla town on Monday. He flagged-off bike ambulances, thereby making the state the first in the region to launch this service.

 The bike service would be implemented by Hyderabad-based GVK-EMRI ( ) under a PPP (public-private partnership) mode.
 
 Thakur said the bike ambulance service had been launched keeping in mind the geographical conditions of the state, which made it difficult for 108 ambulance service to reach the spot. He said the bike ambulance service would supplement the already functional 108 National Ambulance Service. 
 
 Thakur said the service in the first phase would be implemented in Shimla town and thereafter replicated in other parts of the state. He said that on receiving a call on 108 in Shimla city, the Emergency Response Officer ( ) would ascertain whether it would be appropriate to send an ambulance or a bike ambulance, keeping in view, the seriousness of the patients as well as, the topography of the concerned area.
 
 He said that Himachal Pradesh was the fourth state in the country, after Tamilnadu, Karnataka and Goa, to start this bike ambulance service.
