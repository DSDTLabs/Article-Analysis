CHENNAI: A 65-year-old man crossing the road was fatally knocked down by an unknown vehicle close to Indira Nagar MRTS railway station on Wednesday evening on Old Mahabalipuram Road. The death, the second in an   in two weeks at almost the same spot on the busy expressway, has shocked residents of   and nearby areas, who are further petrified that police have been unable to track the vehicles involved.

 On September 3, a three-year-old girl riding pillion with her mother died after a yet-to-be-traced car knocked down her mother’s bike from behind. Earlier, two bikers skidded off their vehicles and suffered injuries. The stretch of   between   and TIDEL Park has been witnessing rampant wrong-side driving and jaywalking by road-users, including techies and cabbies.
 
 The man killed in Wednesday’s accident was identified as Sahadevan Duraiswamy, a security guard at a private firm in Adyar. The resident of Thiruveethi Amman Koil Street in Kanagam had crossed the median and was darting across the stretch when he was struck by the car around 7.30pm.
 
 He lay at the spot for almost 30 minutes as an ambulance of the 108 service couldn’t arrive early. He was finally shifted in an autorickshaw to the Voluntary Health Services (VHS) hospital where doctors pronounced him ‘brought dead’. The man’s body was handed over to his family after performing autopsy at the Government Royapettah Hospital (GRH).
 
 IIT-Madras has put up closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras at the bridge opposite the Indira Nagar MRTS Railway Station. They are monitored at a control room on the IIT-M campus. However, IIT-M officials have not set up a back-up device connected to the CCTV camera to store footage.
 
 A police officer said they had asked IIT-M officials to set up the recording facility soon.
