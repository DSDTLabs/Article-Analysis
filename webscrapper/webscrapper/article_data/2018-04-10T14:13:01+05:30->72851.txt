NAGPUR: Former mayor and   corporator Pravin Datke, Youth Congress city unit president and corporator Bunty Shelke, Congress corporator   along with several others were booked by   police for creating ruckus at Empress Mall following death of three workers in a well on mall premises on Saturday.

 With politicians joining the protests over the workers’ death, it seems that they have already started the groundwork for the upcoming Lok Sabha and assembly elections, scheduled next year.
 
 It is suspected that the three workers — Deepak Gauthe, Chandrashekhar Barapatre and Ajay Garodi — had died after inhaling poisonous gas in the well. Following post mortem on Sunday, relatives of the deceased refused to perform the last rites and instead took the bodies to the mall at around 4.15pm and staged protests demanding compensation of Rs25 lakh each from the mall management. Some politicians along with their supporters too joined them.
 
 The protests created panic among the visitors who had come there for Sunday shopping. As the protesters refused to leave the mall, police had to intervene and close down the mall at around 7.30pm. It was only after an assurance from the mall management that the kin agreed to vacate the mall and perform the last rites. Later, the cremation was performed at Ambazari ghat late in the night following arrangements made by some politicians.
 
 Shelke even demanded closer of Empress Mall citing several illegalities in its construction.
 
 Union minister Nitin Gadkari had announced a compensation of Rs2 lakh each for the kin of workers while compensation from chief minister’s relief fund has also been promised.
 
 The police had earlier booked a case against five persons including Pravin Tayal, chairman of   which owns the mall and manager   for causing death due to negligence.
