JAIPUR: On completion of four years of Narendra Modi government, the state BJP praised Modi-led government claiming that its “policy-driven government” has launched schemes for the benefit of the people. State BJP hit hard at Congress claiming that it has never encouraged politics of ideology (vichaar).

 Criticising Congress, social justice minister   on Saturday said, “Congress politics is based on parivarwad (based on a particular family), jatiwad (castebased politics) and tushtikaran (appeasement). But BJP encourages politics of development.” While addressing newspersons, Chaturvedi said, “It is not just celebrations but we are presenting our report card on the works done in past four years.”
 
 He praised the government for its schemes, such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP), Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala scheme of the ministry of petroleum & natural gas for providing LPG connections to women from Below Poverty Line (BPL), providing soil health cards to the farmers, providing e-Bazaar, a platform to farmers for selling their crops, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, a government-backed life insurance scheme in India, skill development scheme etc.
 
 Chaturvedi praised the government for launching surgical strike on Pakistan and also tackling the Doklam issue with sensitivity with China.
 
 While praising farmerfriendly schemes, he said that 25 mandis of the state are now connected with e-Bazaar. It is a platform which is provided to the farmers for selling their crops at a mandi which is offering highest prices. “A farmer can see online which mandi is purchasing his crops at highest prices,” he said.
