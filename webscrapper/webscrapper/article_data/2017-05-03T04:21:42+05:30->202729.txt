KOLKATA: The state law commission, headed by Justice Pratap Kumar Chatterjee, is planning to frame laws to prevent various   acts. The panel will be visiting various parts of the state where black magic is practised among communities. In May, they will be in Jhargram.

 Two recent cases — one of human sacrifice in Purulia where a man sacrificed his mother and in Burdwan where a father attempted to sacrifice his daughter for prosperity — had been eye openers. The commission will be talking to communities where human sacrifice is practised and will create awareness after talking to NGOs, police and administration.
 
 The new rules will aim to check activities like human sacrifice, voodooism and aghori activities (cannibalism). The panel also plans to ban advertisements that promise instant relief through sorcery. However, the panel will not be touching anything directly linked with religion. So astrologers might be allowed to advertise, but if they say they can create magic within minutes through brain control they might land behind bars.
 
 Maharashtra has already introduced this act, said an official at Nabanna. Consumer affairs minister Sadhan Pandey said he had earlier planned to introduce a law in this regard to stop astrologers appearing on television, but he did not go ahead with it as it might hurt religious sentiments.
