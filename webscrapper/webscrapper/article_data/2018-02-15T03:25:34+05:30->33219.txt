NEW DELHI: In the new academic session, those clearing Class XII board exams will have the option to join four-year integrated BA-B Ed or BSc-B Ed courses. According to a HRD ministry source, the move to drop the present two-year course in Bachelor of Education is to ensure that only serious aspirants opt to be part of the teaching profession like in the case for engineering or medicine. 

 The ministry is planning to revamp the two year B Ed course to a 4-year integrated teacher training programme. The ministry had written to the   ( ) to start working on this plan which was also announced by finance minister   in his budget speech. 
 
 NCTE sources said the revamped syllabus for the integrated BA-B Ed and BSc-B Ed will be more practical-oriented. In November 2014, NCTE had unveiled new models for teacher training courses, including the two-year B Ed after graduation, replacing the one-year course and the four-year integrated course after Class XII. 
 
 As of March 2016, 15 lakh students were pursuing teacher training courses. Of them, only 4,000 were pursuing the integrated programme. According to HRD sources, NCTE is likely to submit the draft proposal by March, 2018. 
 
 The ministry is likely to finalise the rules and regulations for the courses before the commencement of the 2018-19 academic session so that universities can opt for it and announce the admission schedule.
