KOHIMA: Political parties, at the national and regional level, have shown their support to the movement demanding a resolution of the Naga peace process before assembly election in the state, the National Socialist Council of   (Isak-Muivah) and the six Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) said.

 “We appreciate all the political parties, both national and regional, for responding positively to ‘solution, not election’. The negotiators are overwhelmed by the support of the people, particularly at this juncture, when the Nagas are once again put to the test,” a statement — signed by   (I-M) Kilo konser (home minister)   and NNPG working committee member   — said. The statement came after a meeting organised by the Core Committee of Nagaland Tribal Hohos and Civil Organizations on Sunday in  .
 
 “We also express our appreciation to all tribal hohos and civil society organisations for their immeasurable services rendered towards building oneness,” the statement said. They issued a warning against “sabotaging” the negotiations by filing nominations and “indulging in election process”. There can be “adverse ramifications” for the ongoing peace talks if the assembly election is held now, they cautioned. The committee has convened another meeting of all national and regional parties, and negotiating teams here on Monday.
