Kolkata: Trinamool Congress MP and actor Tapas Paul met party secretary general Partha Chatterjee on Wednesday to say that his medical condition had prevented him from attending Parliament and doing party work.

 This was Paul’s first formal interaction with the party leadership after being released on bail by the Orissa High Court on February 1.
 
 “He is like an elder brother to me. So, I came to meet him. I apprised him of my medical condition and said I had been advised rest. I will plunge myself in party work once I am fit to do so,” Paul told reporters after meeting Chatterjee at his Naktala home.
 
 According to sources, he expressed his wish to meet chief minister Mamata Banerjee. In April 2017, the CM had flown to Bhubaneswar to meet party MPs Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Paul, who was then in custody while being treated in a private hospital.
 
 Sources said Paul went to Chatterjee’s home to remove misgivings that while he had resumed acting, he wasn’t medically fit to take up party work. “Cinema is my blood. That is all that I do,” Paul told reporters. He claimed Chatterjee had conveyed to him that he should get fit before taking up party work. Paul has also expressed his willingness to campaign for the party in the upcoming panchayat polls.
