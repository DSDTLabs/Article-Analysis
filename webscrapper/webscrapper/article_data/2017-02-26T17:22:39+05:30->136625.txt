Actress   is no stranger to the Tamil film industry.

  After enchanting the audience with her performance in the film Rekka, Sija went on to act in none other than   Vijay's  .
 On her experience acting alongside Vijay, she says, 'I played a young mother in the film. I was quite tense at the outset as we did not have a proper introduction and I had a big dialogue to deliver in the first shot. However, despite all the nervousness, the scene went quite well, and Vijay sir in turn complimented me. It was quite an icebreaker for me, and I felt much more comfortable.'
 
 Since both of them are reserved by nature, they did not interact much. However, Sija is all praise for the actor, 'He is always composed and calm but when in front of the camera, Vijay sir suddenly becomes the character, surprising everyone around. The transformation is amazing.'
  Meanwhile, Sija is still basking in the attention that she garnered for her character Mala in the Vijay Sethupathi-starrer Rekka. She says, 'Mala was whole-heartedly accepted by all. I would attribute all credits to the director's vision.'
 
 So, what next? 'After Rekka, I have been getting several offers from Tamil. However, I did not want to repeat similar roles. Meanwhile, I also want to direct a film in the future. But it should definitely make a mark,' she signs off.
