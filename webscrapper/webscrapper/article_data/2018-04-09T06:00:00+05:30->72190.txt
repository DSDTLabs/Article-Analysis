 TOI on Sunday visited the quarries near Garkhatanga along the Ranchi ring road, Kochbong and Lal Khatang areas along the Ranchi-Khunti bypass and found many of them abandoned. The quarries were spread across vast patches of plateau, from where stones have either already been excavated or people were found manually breaking stones in the pits.
 
 TOI attempted to speak to some of the local villagers, most of whom are tribals, but they refused to comment on the illegal yet flourishing mining activities.
 
 Illegal stone mining is rampant in the state, especially in   and   districts.
