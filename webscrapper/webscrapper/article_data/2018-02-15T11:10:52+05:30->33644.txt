AGRA: The venue for the much publicized two-day cultural event, "Braj Holi Rasotsav", being organised by Mathura MP and actor,  , on the banks of   on Feb 23 and 24, has been shifted to the Veterinary University after a local organisation raised environmental concerns. 

 The organization, Sri Mathur Chaturved Parishad, had approached the   (NGT) that permission should not be given for any program that creates pollution in   and hurts the sentiments of people. 
 
 They claimed that due to the event, hundreds of vehicles would violate the environmental norms, as space to accommodate them was being created by felling trees. Talking to TOI on phone, Hema Malini said that it's unfortunate that people have politicised the issue. "We were doing everything according to NGT rules," she said.
 
 She said that it is the first time when "legends" like Pt Jasraj, Hariprasad Chaurasia and   are going to perform in Mathura. 
 
 Hema, who herself was performing on February 24, is not sure whether she will be able to do so or not. She said, "I am tense due to change of the venue at the last moment and we have to make all arrangements within a week." The chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, will inaugurate the event.
