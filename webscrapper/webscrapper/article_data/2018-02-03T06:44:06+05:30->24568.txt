AHMEDABAD: The   had gone all out to claim credit to be ‘the first state to   in the country’ and on Friday, the   Bhupendrasinh Chudasama added further political hues to the matter, alleging that the Congress is backing the   that have moved court against the state’s fee regulation law.

 Chudasamatold reporters on Friday that senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal was one of the 39 lawyers hired by the school managements to litigate against the Gujarat government’s fee regulation law.
 
 “On one hand, Congress opposes hefty fees charged by school managements at the same time the Congress is directly and indirectly backing the school managements. This is evident that Congress is against the state government’s fee regulation law, as its senior leaders are contending against us and on behalf of the school managements,” Chudasama said at a press conference, convened one day after the Supreme Court order with regard to fee regulation laws in Gujarat on Thursday. Chudasama said the apex court acknowledged that the Gujarat government has the power to regulate fees. The education minister went on to claim that this was “a victory of the Gujarat government in the Supreme Court”.
 
 “I appeal to the school managements to reduce their fee rather than keep challenging the government’s decision in court and hiring advocates by paying them hefty fees,” he said.
 
 Education secretary Sunaina Tomar stressed that that 39 big advocates were hired by the school managements against the state government’s fee regulation law. About the top court’s directions to collect provisional fees, both the minister and education secretary said that they will take advocate general’s advice on the issue.
 
 Chudasama dodged questions over provisional fees and kept reiterating that no doubts should be raised about the state government’s intention to regulate exorbitant school fees.
