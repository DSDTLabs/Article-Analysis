NEW DELHI: If   quits the party, it will be a big loss, former Chief Minister of Delhi   said acknowledging Walia's seniority and his contributions in cabinet.

 "What can I say? He has said it all. I can only say one thing that he has worked with me as a minister and he was good. If he leaves the party, it will be a big loss,"   said on Monday after Walia threatened to quit the party following disagreement with the leadership over ticket distribution for the municipal polls.
 
  
  On being asked if she had experienced the same indifference from the party leadership, Dikshit chose to be cautious. "People can come and people can go in a party, but for me Congress is the most important. As far as ticket distribution goes, they must have done what they thought was best," she said.
 
 
 After the 2013 assembly polls where the  , led by CM Dikshit, lost the elections, the former CM has not been projected by the party at the forefront in Delhi politics. 
 
 After 2015 polls when the Congress was wiped out of the assembly,   took charge. Since then it has been seen that the party has consistently kept Dikshit out of it revival and strategising exercise in Delhi.
