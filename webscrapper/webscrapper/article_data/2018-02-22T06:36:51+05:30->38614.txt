KOLKATA: The state government is set to decongest Barrackpore Trunk (BT) Road, the north-south lifeline for the city. Transport minister   said in the assembly on Wednesday that plans were afoot to build a 5km, 6-lane elevated corridor, complete with three vehicular underpasses and a number of slip roads for easy access.

 The corridor and underpasses — between   and Dunlop crossing — would reduce travel time along the stretch to one-third the time it currently takes commuters to navigate the often congested thoroughfare. A source said it would take about five years to be completed.
 
 
 
  
 
 B T Road, which connects the northern parts of the city with the northern suburbs of greater Kolkata, touching a number of important institutions — including Indian Statistical Institute (ISI),   (RBU) and   — is poised to exceed its vehicular saturationsaturation level in a few years. “Recently, we have imposed restrictions on goods vehicle movement during the morning (8am-noon) and evening (4pm-9pm) peak hours,” said state PWD minister  .
 
 The detailed project report of the project is under process. The estimated cost of the is around Rs 1,200 crore, said sources.
 
 A lot of groundwork, however, needs to precede construction. The busy road needs to be widened, for one. The bigger task will be the relocation of underground utilities, including the five pipelines that supply water from Phalta to Tallah.
 
 The vehicular underpasses will be at Sinthee, Tobin Road and Dunlop. The Dunlop underpass is ready and will be thrown open to traffic in two months. “We are also exploring the possibility of having a Dakshineswar-bound ramp from the elevated corridor, as there is huge passenger demand,” said a senior PWD engineer.
 
 Bengal’s target is to set up a kitty of Rs 14,000 crore for infrastructure projects. Officials said the finance department has asked 30 departments to return unused funds so that it could be utilized for new projects.
