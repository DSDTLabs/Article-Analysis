GFES officials said that they have asked the city police to ban the entry of people into the area that has reported a high number accidents in the recent past. “I have been coming to Sant Sarovar for photographs for the past few months and was surprised how safety was thrown to wind,” says Kevin Antao, a photographer. “The barrage could be sabotaged by terrorists if such loose security is maintained.” A senior fire official said that Monday’s tragedy was expected as many visitors climbed the barrage gates to take selfies.
