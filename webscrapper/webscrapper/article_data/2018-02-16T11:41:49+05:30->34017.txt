NEW DELHI: A shocked   on Thursday asked the   government while questioning the state whether it was doing a “charity” by giving a measly Rs 6,500 to sex assault survivors. 

 The apex court said it was shocking that Madhya Pradesh, which was among the states which had received maximum funds from the Centre under the Nirbhaya Fund, was disbursing Rs 6,000-6,500 only to each rape survivor. 
 
 A bench of Justices   and Deepak Gupta, while perusing the affidavit filed by Madhya Pradesh, said, “According to you and your affidavit, on an average, you are paying Rs 6,000 to a rape victim. Are you doing a charity? How can you do so. ... You value a rape at Rs 6,500?” 
 
 “For Madhya Pradesh, the figures are fantastic. There are 1,951 rape victims in Madhya Pradesh and you are giving them Rs 6,000-Rs 6,500 each. Is that good, commendable? What is this,” the bench asked, adding, “this is total insensitiveness”. 
 
 The court had last month directed all states and Union Territories to file an affidavit indicating the amount received by them under the Nirbhaya Fund towards survivor compensation, amount disbursed by them under the scheme and the number of survivors of sexual assault. 
 
 
 
 
 As many as 24 states and UTs are yet to file their affidavits. During the hearing, when Haryana’s counsel said they would file their affidavit, the bench observed, “If you have not filed affidavit, it is a very clear indication of what you feel for safety of women in your state. You take your time and tell the women in your state that you do not care for them.” the bench said while observing that 24 states and UTs have not yet filed their affidavit as per the court's direction
