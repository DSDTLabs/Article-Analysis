AHMEDABAD: A woman was hacked to death by her lover Vinod Dhanak (25), a native of Hisar in  , and his four accomplices including a minor boy on May 5. Dhanak had been living in Nana Chiloda for the past several years and the duo was allegedly in relationship for about three years. Marwadi’s body was found from an isolated spot on Noblenagar-Nandigram Road on May 5.

 “In a joint operation by the crime branch and the Naroda police, all five accused were arrested on Sunday night. Those arrested are Vinod Dhanak, Sumeet Dhanak, Bijendra Valmiki, Sandeep Dhanak and the minor boy,” said H B Vaghela, inspector at Naroda police station. According to police, Vinod, who runs a catering business in Nana Chiloda, had an affair with Marwadi for the past three years.
 
 “Of late, Posu had been putting pressure on Vinod to marry her but he was not ready for that. Vinod had already married his widowed sister-in-law,” said Vaghela. When Marwadi continued to insist on marriage, Vinod decided to kill her and contacted his friends.
 
 “On May 5, he made the minor accused call up Posu who asked her to reach an isolated spot on Noblenagar- Nandigram Road. Vinod had already bought a machete from Dehgam. He and other accused then hacked Posu to death and dumped her body at the spot,” said an investigator.
 
 Inspector H R Jadeja said that Naroda police with the help of city crime branch gathered information about the victim when they got to know that she had an affair with Vinod. “When we interrogated Vinod, he broke down and confessed to killing Posu,” he added.
 
 The police have recovered bloodstained clothes of the accused and the machete with which Posu was hacked to death.
