CHENNAI: The   Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) and the Greater   have will evict families living along the   next week.

 TNSCB officials said the drive that was to be held a few days ago has been postponed to arrange police protection. “We are in talks with the police department. If police protection is available, eviction will be carried out from October 4 to 6.”
 
 Asked how many families would be evicted, the official said, “Enumeration work is going on. So the number of families is not available.”
 
 Corporation officials said families would be shifted to tenements in Perumbakkam. 
 
 However, Nochi Nuppam and Nochi Nagar residents have demanded that fishing families be allowed to stay in the temporary shelters near Nochi Kuppam.
 
 “The families living here have been informed in advance that we will have to move out by next week. But we are demanding that those among us engaged in fishing be allowed to settle in the shelters till newer tenements are constructed here,” said K Bharathi, a fisherman.
 
 Several fisher families who have been allotted houses in the 536 tenements at Nochi Kuppam and 628 tenements at Nochi Nagar still prefer to live in the shanties on the beach, according to officials.
