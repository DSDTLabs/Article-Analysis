PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday urged the state government employees to wear   clothes once or twice a week.

 Addressing a gathering at the inaugural ceremony of Rashtriya Khadi/ Shilp Mahotsava 2018, organised by the state industries department, the CM said, “The state government is committed to revival and growth of khadi industry. Hence, I appeal to the officials to wear khadi at least one or two days in a week. This would help to create new employment opportunities and increase the income of weavers.”
 
 Nitish also mentioned about the various incentives proposed in the khadi policy being mooted by the state government. “The state government will give incentives to cover at least 20% of the manufacturing cost. Similarly, stamp and registration duty would be waived for units involved in manufacturing khadi. Besides, a web portal is also proposed for khadi manufacturing units,” said the CM.
 
 The CM while enumerating the incentives already being provided in khadi sector said, “Khadi manufacturing units can get loans from banks on 4% interest and the remaining interest would be borne by state government.” 
 
 Over 150 stalls exhibiting khadi products from Bihar and several other states have been put up at the Khadi Mahotsava organised at Gyan Bhavan here, which will conclude on February 12. 
 
 The CM also asked the industries department to organise the mahotsava every year.
