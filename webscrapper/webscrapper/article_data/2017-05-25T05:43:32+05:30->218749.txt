NEW DELHI: He had promised his friends a   match in the evening before leaving for extra classes at his school on Wednesday morning, but 15-year-old Sparsh Rawal died minutes away from reaching his house in  . He was hit by a speeding   while sitting inside an e-rickshaw.

 The Rawal family is yet to come to terms with their loss. They were inconsolable after getting informed by the police about the  . “I can’t believe that Sparsh will not be with us anymore. One second he was here, the next moment he was gone forever,” said Raju, the boy’s uncle.
 
 Still in a state of shock, his friends said that they had met him in the morning before he left for his extra classes. 
 
 “We are a group of six-seven friends. We used to meet every morning these days as our summer vacations are on. When I spoke to Sparsh last, he said that he wanted to buy stationary for a school project and had asked me to accompany him to the market on his return,” said Shubham, his friend.
 
 Sparsh’s family members said that he never had an argument with anyone. “Even when most of us would end up fighting, he was the one who tried to solve the problem,” said Sarthak, another friend. They were planning to celebrate a friend’s birthday this week, but now the plan has been shelved.
 
 His tuition teacher since the past two years, Navinder Khanna, said that she got to know of the incident at noon. “I hold tuition classes every day at 2pm. I was preparing for the classes when a student called to inform me about the incident. I thought he was playing a prank and shouted at him. But when I called up Sparsh’s parents, they told me about his death. He was an excellent student and a wonderful person,” she added.
 
 Sparsh’s maid,  , who was close to him, said, “He did not deserve such a tragic end.”
