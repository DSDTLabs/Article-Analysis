PUNE: An association of   have complained to district election officials for rejection of their voter registration applications repeatedly.

 Members of the   Housing Society Association said their enrolment applications were accepted to be rejected eventually “without being verified by block level officials”.
 
 Harcharajeet Butalia, founder member of the association, said, “We had registered online in December 2017. To our surprise, many of us did not find our names in the voters’ list. There was no intimation for the rejection of the applications.”
 
 IT professional Nitin Kumar Jain who stays at Suyog Nisarg in Wagholi, was among the residents whose application were rejected without “proper reason” despite repeated attempts. “I had cancelled my voter card from Delhi as I had applied for a fresh one in Pune. After failed attempts, I had reapplied last month, but no verification has been done of the application,” Jain said.
 
 IT professional   and his lawyer wife, Shweta, have also been trying for the enrolment for the last two years. They said their applications were rejected twice. “I had received a call from a BLO asking for some details. However, there was no progress after that,” Ajay said.
 
 Same was the case with Gitesh Porwal and his wife, Shrutika. “We could not vote for the gram panchayat elections in December last year due to the issue,” the Porwals said.
 
 The association has been repeatedly holding meetings with local politicians and district officials, but to no avail. “Finally, we raised the issue with the district election officials,” Butalia said.
 
 When contacted, Haveli tehsildar   said, “We will look into the situation to ensure that the residents are enrolled in the ongoing enrolment drive,” said.
