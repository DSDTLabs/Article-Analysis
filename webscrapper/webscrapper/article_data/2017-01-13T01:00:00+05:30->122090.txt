The impending 13-year leap in the TV show ' ' has come as a blessing in disguise for Mayank Gandhi. Though it’ll spell the end of his track, the actor’s happy that he’ll finally get to go on his much-delayed honeymoon. Mayank married actress Hunar Hale in August 2016, following a bitter break-up with actress  , with whom he was in a relationship for six years. 
While Mayank refused to divulge details about his track getting over in the show, he was quite candid about his thoughts on marriage. He also does not wish to comment on the breakup between him and Mihika. 
 He says, “Mihika is my past and I wish her good luck. Hunar is my present and future, and she entered my life at a point when I needed emotional balance. For any relationship to work, transparency, trust and love are important. If your partner is not open about her ideas or does not share her feelings, it becomes difficult to develop an understanding.” 
 Mayank refuses to reveal his honeymoon destination, saying he wants to surprise Hunar. Unlike most actors, he is okay with his wife romancing other actors on screen. “I am happy that I married someone who understands my career. I have no qualms about her romancing another actor on screen, it’s all part of the job. Even I will romance other actresses on screen,” he smiles.
