LUCKNOW: Family members of Netaji   on Tuesday said that they want the report from the   on   to be scrapped.

 The family members and others, who have deposed before a commission headed by Justice Vishnu Sahai, met chief minister Yogi Adityanath on the 121st birth anniversary of Bose.
 
 They said the high court had directed that the commission must have senior officers, researchers and experts but that was not the case. All the commission did was take oral statements and visit Faizabad a few times, they said in a memorandum to the CM.
 
 “We request the government to form a special investigation team to investigate the Gumnami Baba case in accordance with the directions of the HC. It should examine in detail all items and documents belonging to Gumnami Baba and take statements of people related to the case in any way. Because of the complexity of the case, nothing less than a worldclass investigation team would be able to reach a conclusion,” reads the memorandum. They also demanded that all documents belonging to Gumnami Baba must be digitized.
 
 “The digitisation process till now has been done in very careless manner—only a few books were digitized. The HC had asked for all letters, maps and notes found among Gumnami Baba’s possessions to be digitized as they are historically valuable but those documents are lying in a pitiable condition in Faizabad district treasury,” the letter reads.
 
 The signatories in the letter were Bose’s grand niece Jayanti Rakshit (Bose), her husband Amiya K Rakshit, founder member of  , and state spokesperson of Apna Dal (S) Arvind Sharma. All signatories had deposed to the commission.
