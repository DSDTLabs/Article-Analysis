PUNE: Caution must accompany any visit to secluded areas in and around Pune especially after two students were found murdered in the forested area near   close to Lonavla.

 Attacks on trekkers and couples visiting forested areas or other such isolated locations at night are on rise,   told TOI. They said that women and lone trekkers are especially at risk, and suggested that if there are women, the group size should be large.
 
 Anand Kenjale, director of Explorers Treks and Tours, said, “People should never venture into such locations alone or without consulting the local authorities or professional groups. People must go with a large group and also WhatsApp the location to their kin or friends,” he said.
 
 Trekkers should study the location online before deciding to visit it. “One will find a mine of information on how safe the location is by a simple search. The study will also help an explorer understand if the place is high on the crime radar,” Kenjale said.
 
 Other experts said self-defense paraphernalia like pepper spray, a knife and chilli powder should always be handy in such areas.
 
 Samiran Kolhe, a certified mountaineering instructor, said most places have a ‘safe’ time. “It is a time when it is safe to venture into such places. However, one should by all means avoid going to such places after 6pm.” With robberies at such spots rising, experts said costly gadgets and ornaments should not be taken along.
 
 Other experts suggested that there should be at least eight to nine men in the group during such expeditions. Rushikesh Kulkarni, who runs a cult tourism outfit Breakfree Journeys, said, “Inform those in the last inhabitation you see that you are visiting a spot close by. There is always a base village beyond which most areas are inhabitable. Therefore, informing them is prudent in case you need rescue.”
