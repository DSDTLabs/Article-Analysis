MEERUT: If you happen to visit the city's Cantonment  , don't be amazed to see dogs running all around. The hospital, which an official says will be converted into a  , is lying   for nearly three months, with more dogs than patients. 

  Presently, the only occupant of the general ward is a 38-year-old man, who is put on a glucose drip. In fact, the patient said that he was asked to purchase the glucose bottle himself. "I was admitted at the hospital on Thursday after I experienced acute pain in my abdomen. The doctors here told me that I will have to arrange the glucose and antibiotics myself as it is unavailable at the hospital. I spent Rs 2,000 on the medicines and Rs 750 on various tests, which were conducted in private labs," said Raees Ahmed, a labourer.
 
 The hospital has a surgeon on roll, but no anaesthesiologist or a syringe. There is a pathology lab in the premises, which refers patients to private labs, as it can only conduct blood sugar test. There are no X-ray film rolls due to which no radiology tests can be conducted.
 
  The doctors and staff at the hospital refused to speak to TOI on the issue and suggested that we speak to cantonment board officials as the hospital runs under   (MCB).
 
  MCB CEO Rajeev Srivastav said that the hospital isn't making enough money and they are not satisfied by the performance of the staff.
 
  "We conducted a study and found that it requires a complete overhaul because of the way its staff has been functioning . It has resulted in complete destruction of the system," Srivastav said while refusing to give details. He further said that MCB has plans to convert it into a multi-speciality hospital but did not divulge into the details of the plan.
