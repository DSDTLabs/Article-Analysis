HYDERABAD: After a lull, Telangana and   renewed their water war on Wednesday which was triggered by the former stopping release of water to the right canal of Nagarjuna   which flows into the latter state. By the end of the day, Telangana lodged a complaint against AP with the   district collector and SP. 

 Telangana irrigation officials said they stopped the water after the   (KRMB) issued a letter to them on Tuesday stating that AP has exceeded its quota of water by 2.3 TMC as of February 26 and urged the residuary state to immediately stop unauthorised excessive drawls of water. However, AP irrigation claimed they had actually received 0.3 TMC of water less than the allocated quota of 60 TMC from January to February end. The drama began after Telangana stopped the release of water around 8am on Wednesday. Immediately, AP irrigation officials confronted their Telangana counterparts leading to a war of words. Adding to the tension, both states summoned additional police personnel from Nalgonda (Telangana) and Guntur (AP) respectively. While Telangana officials displayed the KRMB letter, AP officials displayed a letter written by their engineer-in-chief and demanded the immediate release of water.
 
 "They refused to listen even after we showed the KRMB letter. They said they are not bothered about the overall utilisation and tried to release water with force. They came with the mandal revenue officer and police personnel. I immediately brought this to the notice of Nalgonda district collector and SP," Nagarjuna Sagar chief engineer S Sunil told TOI over telephone. 
 
 While Telangana officials said they need to preserve the water in order to cater to the drinking water needs of Hyderabad, AP officials said they need another 2,000 cusecs of water to be released from the right canal.
