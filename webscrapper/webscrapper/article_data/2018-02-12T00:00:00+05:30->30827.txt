"I’ve been a good son, a good father and a good husband. Now, it’s time to be a good friend more than what I have previously been,” says Sandalwood star   who will soon debut as a talk   host. Based on the theme of friendship, the show titled Number One Yaari, will go on air in March. “I’ve always had the gift of the gab. While judging the dance show I previously was a part of, was a wonderful experience, I like the spontaneity that talk shows offer. Which is why when the makers of this show approached me, I had no second thoughts about saying yes,” shares the actor.
 Moreover, the format was exciting in itself, he adds. “Since it is based on friendship, there is a lot of scope for pulling their leg and throwing fun questions at my guests. It’s also a treat to get a glimpse at enduring   and what makes them tick in the long run,” points out Shivanna. 
 
 It is a well-known fact that while various talk shows have come on Kannada  , the hosts have had to steer clear of controversial/personal questions owing to the “it’s a small industry” syndrome. “But we have touched upon controversies, but it is never with the intention of raking up the past. It is only with the thought of clearing up misunderstandings or giving the matter a logical end,” concurs the actor. “Besides, my biggest takeaway from this stint is that I got to meet both old colleagues and new, hence it’s been the perfect opportunity to renew and forge new friendships,” sums up the Hat-trick Hero.
