CHANDIGARH: The matter of providing hawkers with sites under the   will go to a special meeting between the councillors, the UT administration, and the municipal officers on Friday.

 This will be their first meeting since the municipal corporation House rejected the UT   survey that identified 21,622 street vendors. Mayor   will lead proceedings at this meeting, where the councillors will have their chance to ask for a revised survey that covers maximum vendors, provides for more sites, and keeps Sector 17, 19, and 22 in the vending zones.
 
 Of the street vendors that the UT has identified, 2,388 are essential service providers and 2,568 are mobile. Of the remaining 16,666, only 11,538 are in the current zoning plan that provides for 36 vending locations in different sectors. The architecture department has marked each vending location during physical inspection.
 
 The department has declared northern Sectors 1 to 6, besides Sectors 17, 19, and 22, no-vending zones. In its last general House meeting, the MC had asked for exemption in case of the last three sectors at least. These sectors are shopping hubs with a big number of street vendors. Getting them space elsewhere seems impossible even for the civic body.
