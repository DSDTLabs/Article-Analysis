VADODARA: With ferrying liquor becoming difficult using private vehicles on road due to extensive checking, bootleggers are looking for novel trafficking ideas. 

 One such modus operandi came to light when tribal persons were found with liquor at the   state transport (ST) bus depot. Acting on a tip off, the local crime branch of the Panchmahal police nabbed five persons including four women carrying liquor in nylon gunny sacks at the bus stand. It came to light that they were carrying 2,124 bottles of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL).
 
 The nylon sacks usually used to pack urea or grains are widely used by tribal persons to carry their belongings and other material. In all, 14 such sacks were found from them. The liquor stock including beer and quarter bottles of whisky found in the sacks was valued at Rs one lakh.
 
 Police said that the stock was given to them by Kamlesh Damor, a bootlegger living in Hathiyavan village of Limkheda taluka of Dahod district. The stock was to be carried to Vadodara where they had planned to sell it at places were the labourer population was high. Damor is yet to be arrested.
 
 All the five accused nabbed at the Godhra bus depot are residents of the Goriya village of Limkheda taluka.
