Visakhapatnam: The situation in Vizianagaram district is looking pretty grim especially in the upland areas between Vizianagaram town and Gajapathinagaram as well as the dry rural parts has received just 169.8mm of rainfall so far this month as against an average of 206mm.

 Farmers, especially in the dry zones and Gajapathinagaram mandals, are feeling the pinch. Around 6,000 hectares of tank-irrigated land are lying fallow. A local farmer from Gajapathinagaram, B Poli Raju said, “My land is totally tank fed and so far they have shown no signs of getting saturated. The rains have been disappointing and if we do not have enough rains in the coming week, we can forget Kharif.”
 
  District collector Vivek Yadav said, “It is too early to write off the rains. More importantly, if there is a real issue with rains, just as last year we will identify the affected mandals and take the necessary steps.” tnn
