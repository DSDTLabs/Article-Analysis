HYDERABAD: Launching new campuses, taking over sick colleges, admitting students, collecting fees and then leaving them in the lurch. This was the modus operandi perfected by  , principal of Sri  , which is in the eye of a storm.

 In 2015, he conned another 392 students in the same manner and did a fly-by-night operation when Telangana State   (TSBIE) slapped him with Rs 11 lakh penalty. At that time, the TSBIE did not file a criminal case against the college management.
 
 He started Navodaya Junior College in LB Nagar, admitted students, including 157 in the first year, 172 in the second year and 63 intermediate second year (private) students. Seenaiah, according to officials, mopped up more than Rs 7 lakh in fees, but none of the students received hall tickets for writing exams as the college did not remit the fee to BIE. At that time, students were allowed to take exams at Government Junior College at Saroornagar.
 
 “He has a simple plan in place. When parents and students are worried, the government allows them to write examination and he gets away with the money. By using this method, he cheated many students. We are digging out his past history,” said TSBIE secretary A Ashok.
 
 He said Seenaiah purchased a non-profit college, Varun Junior College, at Vidyanagar in Suryapet town and then opened Sri Vasavi Junior College in Hyderabad, knowing fully well that shifting campus from Suryapet to Hyderabad was impossible. He also admitted 246 students in the college with the promise that they will secure good marks.
 
 TSBIE secretary Ashok said had students or parents raised an alarm when students were barred from practical examinations, the Board would have acted before the annual examinations.
