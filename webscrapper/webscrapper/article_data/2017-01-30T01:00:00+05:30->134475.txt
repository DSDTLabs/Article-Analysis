There can’t be a dull day on a set with   around. The set of 'Jolly LLB 2' wasn’t any different. If it wasn’t the funny lines and scenes, then it would be the actor, who’d give the team reasons to laugh by pulling a fast one on his unsuspecting co-actors. On one occasion,  , his leading lady from the film, had a heart-in-the-mouth moment, before she realised she had been conned. 
For a sequence in the song, 'Bawra Mann',   and   were a couple of feet away from the edge of a cliff. Apart from the duo, there was space for one more person to stand a little off the cliff, which Huma didn’t know about. When she casually patted Akshay on the back, he pretended that he has slipped off the cliff, leaving her shell-shocked, since she hadn’t hit him all that hard. She heaved a sigh of relief when she saw Akshay surfacing from the off-the-cliff spot. 
 Of course, Akshay and she now laugh about the episode. But we do know that the action star can con anyone, anytime.
