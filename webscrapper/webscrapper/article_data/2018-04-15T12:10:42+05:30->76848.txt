MARGAO: Goa Pradesh Mahila Congress Committee (GPMCC), on Saturday, sought an amendment to the government’s Ladli Laxmi scheme, which assures Rs 1 lakh to women above 18 years within a year of their marriage. GPMCC said that the word ‘marriage’ should be dropped as this has resulted in dowry deaths with many cases of women being harassed by their husbands and in-laws for the amount being reported.

 Mahila Congress praised Shubalaxmi Naik, the newly appointed chairperson of the   for Women (GSCW), for sending a proposal to the BJP-led coalition government in Goa to amend the scheme as female applicants were being harassed by their husbands and in-laws.
 
 Vice president of the Mahila Congress, Beena S Naik criticised the “improper implementation of the scheme by the BJP government and their party workers”.
 
 Mahila Congress president Pratima Coutinho along with the South Goa district Mahila Congress president Savitri Kavlekar also criticised the BJP Mahila morcha, particularly Vaidehi Naik and Kunda Chodankar, as well as national BJP women politicians for their silence over the increasing atrocities against women across India. 
 
 They condemned the recent rape incidents that took place in BJP-ruled states of   and Kashmir, and sought justice for the victims’ families. They also severely criticised Prime Minister   and UP chief minister   stating that “both being bachelors, fail to understand the anguish of the fathers of the rape victims” and questioned the delay in arresting the UP BJP MLA  , the main accused in the Unnao rape case. They also took a dig at Union minister for information and broadcasting Smriti Irani who had sent bangles to former UPA PM Manmohan Singh in the aftermath of the Nirbhaya rape case.
