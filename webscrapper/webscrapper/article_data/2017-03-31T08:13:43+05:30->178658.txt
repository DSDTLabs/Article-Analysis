KOCHI: A person caught for drunken driving cannot be booked for   also unless there is evidence for it, the   has held. Police normally book people for both offences and this raises the fine amount significantly. 

 A single bench of the court gave the ruling while quashing a case registered by   police against   (34) for drunken driving (Section 185 of Motor Vehicles Act) and rash and negligent driving (Section 279 of Indian Penal Code). 
 
 A fine of 2,000 is levied for drunken driving for the first offence and 3,000 for the second offence. For rash driving, the fine goes up to 1,000. A fine up to 10,000 can be collected for compounding the offence of causing danger to public or public safety. 
 
 The court said Section 279 IPC contemplated something more than driving or riding a motor vehicle with negligence. "To constitute a penal offence thereunder, such driving or riding should be rash and reckless, endangering human life and that should be through a public way. It is not mere negligent driving or riding but to do so with culpable criminal negligence or proceed against the person for that offence," the judgment said.
 
 According to the prosecution, the petitioner was found driving a car in a rash and negligent manner under the influence of alcohol on June 16, 2013. 
 
 Police had immediately taken him to a government doctor, who certified that he was found to have consumed alcohol but was not under the influence of alcohol.
