PATNA: Tension prevailed in the anatomy department of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) on Friday after staff of a private homoeopathy college tried to “escape” with structure of a human body kept at the hospital for study purpose. 

 After some NMCH staff and students stopped the employees of the private institute from shifting the body to an ambulance, a commotion broke out. The situation, however, was brought under control by the hospital authorities.
 
 Dr Bipin Kumar Singh, a curator at the NMCH’s anatomy department, said the body had already been dissected and was to be taken to the incinerator for incineration. “It seems the staff responsible for incineration informed the private institute about it. The guards and other NMCH staff raised an alarm after noticing that the body was being carried by the employees of the private institute. They were later joined by the NMCH,” Dr Singh added.
 
 NMCH principal Shiv Kumari Prasad said of the two employees who informed the private institute about availability of the body, one has been dismissed. “The private institute had not sought permission from the NMCH to take possession of the body,” she added.
 
 Unclaimed bodies are used in the anatomy department of NMCH for dissection and study.
