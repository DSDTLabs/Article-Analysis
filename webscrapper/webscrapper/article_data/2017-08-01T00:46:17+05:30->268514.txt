MUMBAI: A   is not   from claiming maintenance from her estranged husband, the   has ruled. A division bench of Justice Rajendra Savant and Justice Sadhana Jadhav upheld a family court order directing a Thane software engineer employed with a global IT company to pay interim monthly maintenance of Rs 10,000 to his former wife. The man had claimed that she was well qualified having completed a teachers’ training course in 2001 and so could not claim maintenance as she could sustain herself.

 But the court held that her qualification as teacher did not disqualify her from seeking maintenance. “It is not a case where the wife was employed as a teacher and had given up her job to ...claim maintenance...or that she has not made any attempts to get employment,” said the HC. “In our view, the same would not make any difference in so far as the grant of maintenance to the extent granted by the trial court is concerned, which can be said to reasonable considering the cost of living.” The court said that in case the woman secures a job and earns enough to sustain herself, the husband could file an application for modification of the order of maintenance.
 
 A family court had granted divorce to the couple in 2015 and directed the man, who draws a monthly salary of Rs 1 lakh, to pay her monthly maintenance of Rs 10,000.
