NEW DELHI: AAP on Tuesday kept up its attack on BJP and Congress, accusing them of “misleading” the people of Delhi on the issue of house tax. Chief minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal had last week announced that if his party won the civic polls, it would scrap residential house tax.

 Countering the view that this could be done only by Parliament, AAP’s Delhi convener Dilip Pandey cited Section 177 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. He added: “Even the precedence on this is clear. Revision of tax rates has been done in the past without any Parliament amendment being required.”
 
 “BJP and Congress are frustrated by the response of people to our promise.” He alleged that the only reason for them to oppose the move was that both parties were in a nexus that had been looting the corporations under the name of house taxes.
 
 “AAP will make Delhi the first city that won’t need to pay house tax after April 26. All arrears will be waived,” Pandey said. “BJP and Congress are worried. Why are they against people’s interests? Both parties must clarify — are they in agreement of abolishing house tax, or are they against it? The people of Delhi want to know.”
