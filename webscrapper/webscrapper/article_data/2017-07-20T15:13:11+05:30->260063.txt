HYDERABAD: Puri  's fans got worked up on Wednesday because their favourite director had to face investigation in the  . As Puri went to the excise office at Nampally, some people from the film industry and fans waited outside making their resentment amply clear. The fans were peeved at Puri being dragged into the case and believe he is not involved in drug use. 

  "We know he is not involved and this truth will come out in the investigation," one of them who claimed to be Puri's fan said.
 
 Apart from the support of his fans, Jagannadh was accompanied by his son Akash and brother Sairam Shankar, both of who are actors to the excise office.
 
  However, the two were not allowed inside the interrogation room and were told to wait in another room.
 
 The 50-year-old director looked disturbed while making his way inside the office. Contrary to his trademark smile and cheerful countenance, Jagannadh walked inside the office with irritation writ large on his face. 
 
 When Puri started off from his home to the excise office, his wife   gave him a send off. 
 
 If the drug issue continues to haunt the director, it may well have an adverse effect on his upcoming film 'Paisa Vasool' which is slated for release on September 29, the picturisation of which has reportedly been completed. This is an all-important film for him as it happens to be the 101st movie of actor Balakrishna.
