BAREILLY: A day after external affairs minister   confirmed the deaths of 39 Indians who had been abducted in   in 2014, the Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday released a one minute and 52 second-long film on “legal and safe migration”. 

 The letter, issued by additional chief secretary (CS)  , has instructed district authorities across the state to screen the film in cinema halls and run it on local cable networks. 
 
 Senior officials said that a considerable number of people in the state, particularly unskilled labourers, migrate to the Gulf countries for employment opportunities through illegal channels.
