Chennai: A wooded area, which acted as a green belt for checking pollution in Ennore, is being cleared for the third unit of North   Thermal Power Station (NCTPS), activists have said.

 Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation ( ), which got the nod to build and operate NCTPS I & II after it raised a 240- acre ‘green belt’, was now clearing the same green lung, said Pooja Kumar of Coastal Resource Centre, an NGO.
 
 Environment clearance was granted to NCTPS I on the condition that a green belt be raised around it, she said. 
 
 In 1996, NCTPS II got the nod with the condition: “A green belt should be created around the power plant between the cooling water channel and boundaries of existing plant, around the ash pond area. A norm of 1500-2000 trees/ha should be adopted and the requisite infrastructure such as nursery and manpower etc should be ensured. For filling up of vacant spaces in the existing plant area, a phased joint programme involving the TNEB should be worked out and submitted to the ministry within three months.” 
 
 In 2015, Tangedco submitted a report to the Union ministry of environment and forests, saying a green belt had been raised around the plant as mandated.
 
 Now, activists and residents of the area allege, Tangedco workers have even dumped asbestos roofs of a couple of abandoned buildings in the  , a source of livelihood for fishermen.
 
 R L Srinivasan, a fisherman, said Tangedco was planning to clear the entire Ennore creek on which residents of 24 villages depend. “If the creek is polluted, our livelihood will be affected,” he warned.
 
 When contacted, a senior Tangedco official said an 800MW power plant was coming up at the site with clearance from the Centre. The entire tree cover in the greenbelt area was planted after the first thermal power plant came up, he said. “We will plant twice that number now.”
