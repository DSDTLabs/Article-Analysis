HYDERABAD: Criticising its casual approach, the Hyderabad HC set aside the security contract awarded by   (HMDA) for the Budhapurnima project to a private company, and directed   to select an eligible firm for the job in four weeks. 

 
 Justice MS   was dealing with a petition filed by V Renuka Sakthi Security Services Pvt Ltd, challenging the dubious way in which HMDA entrusted the contract to Agile Security Force Pvt Ltd.
 
  The petitioner's counsel Amancharla V Gopal Rao told the court that HMDA issued an e-procurement notice for selecting a security contract agency in March 2017 for a three-year contract. The contractor would have to procure and install metal detectors,   camera based 24-hour surveillance system and hire manpower to maintain security at Budhapurnima facilities. 
 
  Authorities awarded the contract to Agile without verifying credentials, the counsel said. "When we came to know Agile secured a fake experience certificate from  , we impleaded HCU. HCU admitted before the court it gave the certificate by mistake and later gave modified certificate to Agile, rendering them ineligible to hold contract," Gopal Rao said. The judge concluded that Agile does not fit into five-year experience norm and found fault with authorities for continuing the contract.
