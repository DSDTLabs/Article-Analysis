KOLKATA: Expressing solidarity with the victims, exposed to the wrath of the fundamentalists in recent times, a rally comprising intellectuals, common people and students was taken out from   to Esplanade on Friday evening.The participants with posters and banners walked silently protesting against the attack on the intellectuals in recent times.

 “Recently, an FIR was lodged against poet Srijato. Poet Mandakranta Sen also received a rape threat. Former mayor Bikash Ranjan Bahttacharyay was attacked and people were seen moving with swords in religious processions. We can't relate all this with Kolkata since the city has always been a place for open-minded people. The procession is a protest against these fundamental forces that are making inroads into the cultural and democratic environment of our state,“ one of the conveners of the rally, Ambikesh Mahaptra, said. A large section of the intellectuals and politicians, including former Supreme Court Judge  , poet Mandakranta Sen, filmmaker Tarun Majumdar, painter  , singer   and Congress leader Abdul Mannan, were present in the rally.
 
 “This is a political rally and we need to organise such rallies often if we want to save the state from these communal forces,“ Mahapatra added. “The state is now in the hands of a fascist force and they are giving indulgence to communal forces. This is leading to a very dangerous situation. In this situation, the secular forces will have to come under one umbrella. There is no doubt that the ruling  , in the name of secularism, is tickling the communal sentiments that's giving rise to hardline communal forces like the Bajrang Dal and RSS,“ said Abdul Mannan.
