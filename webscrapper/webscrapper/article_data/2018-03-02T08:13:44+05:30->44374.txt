TRICHY: A mentally ill rape survivor in   received a solatium of 2 lakh from the state government on Thursday for the maintenance of her girl child. The man who was charged with raping her had cleared a DNA test in this regard and was acquitted for lack of evidence last year. 

 The 30-year-old woman from   village near   was handed over the cheque by the special public prosecutor, G Krishnaveni Thamaraiselvan, on the integrated district court campus in the presence of her family members. The solatium, which came as a mild relief to the poverty-stricken woman, was ordered by the mahila court here on August 31 last year. According to the case, the woman used to graze goats on the farm lands of a resident of the village. Though she was unmarried, she became pregnant. When quizzed by her family, she told them that the owner of the farm had raped her several times from November 9, 2014, on the promise of marrying her. 
 
 The woman later gave birth to a girl. Subsequently, the all-woman police station, Manapparai registered a case. The court ordered the man to undergo DNA test to confirm whether he was the father of the child. However, the DNA did not match. After considering the arguments of the counsels of both the parties, the court acquitted him in 2017.
