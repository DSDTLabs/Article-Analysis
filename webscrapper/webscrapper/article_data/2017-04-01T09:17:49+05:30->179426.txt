 "The SSLC mathematics exam had to be re-conducted, and there were rampant and unprecedented anomalies in many other examinations including those for Plus One and even standard one students. The situation demands the arrest of guilty after a strong investigation," Chennithala pointed out in a statement issued here on Friday.
 
 The education minister, who is liable to give an explanation, is remaining silent on the issue while the chief minster is protecting him, the opposition leader alleged. "The government is yet to order any kind of inquiry into this. If the education minister is not ready to resign, he should be removed from the post and should be replaced by an efficient person. The government also should order a judicial probe into the exam irregularities," he said.
 
 Chennithala also blamed  , the left-leaning teachers' organisation 'which has been handed over the power to rule education department' for the widespread irregularities and alleged a scam to the tune of crores of rupees.
