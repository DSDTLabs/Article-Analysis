PATNA: In the eye of a storm for recently exhorting his supporters to beat PM Narendra Modi’s photograph with shoes, Bihar prohibition, excise and registration minister   on Thursday created a fresh controversy, saying the vehicles carrying liquor in the dry state would be set afire.
 
  Prohibition was enforced in Bihar with effect from April 5 last year. Though the law provides for severe punishment for trade and consumption of alcohol and other intoxicants, over 15 lakh litres of liquor has since been seized by government agencies across the state.
  
  The state’s liquor laws do not empower the government agencies to set afire the vehicles. However, Mastan told newsmen in Patna,“We want to set an example for the liquor mafia. We have been so far destroying the illegally smuggled liquor bottles... Now on we will set afire the vehicles carrying liquor.”
  
  Not surprisingly, Mastan’s illegal threat drew flak even from the ruling JD (U). “There is rule of law in Bihar. No one can take any action not prescribed by the law, no matter how influential the person is,” said JD (U) legislator and party’s national general secretary Shyam Rajak.
  
  The opposition   berated Mastan for habitually shooting his mouth off. “This minister has become a ‘mental case’. He blurts out anything and everything that comes to his mind. He is talking nonsense,” BJP legislator   said and advised CM   to reconsider if Mastan was fit to become a minister.
  
  Mastan had on February 22 allegedly asked a crowd at a public meeting against demonetisation in his Amour constituency to beat PM Modi’s photo with shoes. The BJP disrupted proceedings of the state legislature last week in protest.
