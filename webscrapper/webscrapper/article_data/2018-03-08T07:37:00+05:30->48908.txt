CHANDIGARH: The issues of   and regularisation of unauthorised colonies were discussed at a pre-budget meeting chaired by chief minister   on Wednesday.

 MLAs also appreciated Amarinder’s crackdown on illegal mining in   on Tuesday. For regularising illegal colonies, the MLAs sought a time-bound policy, saying they wanted a policy to enable registration of ownership rights for long-held tenancy properties.
 
 Meanwhile, the CM announced that the SC post-matric scholarship in government and private colleges, which had been cleared in the audit inquiry conducted to weed out fake enrolments, had been disbursed up till January 2018. He also promised in-toto implementation of the report of the expert group set up to examine ways to revive defunct sugar mills in the state. 
 
 Members from Nawanshahr sought release of funds for pending dues of sugarcane farmers, on which the CM said the issue was being addressed. Some members asked for softening of CLU conditions for setting up rice-shelling units to boost industry and employment opportunities. Ludhiana MLAs expressed concerns over the “pitiable” condition of the 16km   and encroachment of government and corporation land, to which local governments minister   assured of early steps to initiate the process of recalling encroached land.
 
 Most MLAs wanted better education infrastructure in their constituencies. Traffic concerns, sewerage problems, shifting of dairies and bus stands and stubble burning were some of the other concerns raised by the members. Members also wanted higher allocation of funds, in the budget, for research and prevention of cancer, as well as for pollution control programmes in the state. There were suggestions to further engage with Punjabi NRIs to encourage them to harness industrial and investment opportunities in the state to boost overall development. Amarinder said his government was working hard to partner with the NRI community to push progress in the state.
