JAIPUR: The Chittorgarh police averted a major conflict between two Muslim sects—   and   — by mediation after a dispute arose between the two over a burial on Saturday.

 The family of middle-aged deceased Ahmed Husain alias Munna, who belongs to the Deobandi sect, was denied the right to bury Husain in the graveyard close to Delhi Gate by the Barelvi sect, who constitute the majority among Muslims in Chittogarh. Barelvi Muslims believe in Sufi shrines whereas the Wahabbis consider practices and rituals in Sufi shrines as a perversion of Islam.
 
 Munna died in the hospital in the wee hours on Saturday after renal failure. His family faced objections from the opposing sect while preparing to bury him in the city graveyard.
 
 The denial sparked tension between the two sects. The situation began to deteriorate after the deceased’s wife filed a complaint stating that the opposite sect was illegally obstructing the burial.
 
 Expecting the worse, the administration deployed additional police force in Muslim strongholds during the day. Throughout the day, the police held individual and group meetings with both the groups to find an amicable solution.
 
 “Considering the sensitivity of the matter, we decided to seek an amicable solution,” said P K Khamesara, SP Chittorgarh.
 
 The situation, however, went out of control when the family of the deceased, whose body was kept at Gol Pyao in the old city centre, demanded burial at the graveyard in the city.
 
 Some Barelvi Muslims also gathered at Gol Pyao opposing the demand.
 
 Sensing trouble, the police had to resort to a  . “The body was kept in the ambulance for a while. We imposed Section 144 in the area to contain the situation. It was learnt that some outsiders were provoking the deceased’s family for a burial in the city though the family was ready to bury him in Bhilwara which has a Deobandi graveyard,” said Khamesara. The police convinced the family for a burial in Bhilwara.
