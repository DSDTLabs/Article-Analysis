NEW DELHI: A day after   hit the campaign trail in   for the SP-Congress alliance,   slammed the Gandhi scion on Saturday accusing her of seeking votes for those accused of rape and murder. 

 Referring to rape charge against Gayatri Prajapati, a minister in the Akhilesh Yadav-led SP government, who is contesting from Amethi and the murder charge against another SP nominee Arun Verma, BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said it is unfortunate that Priyanka is campaigning for such candidates and questioned the silence of  . 
 
 "It is unfortunate that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra sought votes for someone who is accused of a heinous crime like rape. She chose to keep mum on the allegation. She and Rahul Gandhi are not with the people of Uttar Pradesh but with those accused of rape and murder and those who protect them," Sharma told reporters. Sharma said Priyanka is a part-time politician, who must be ignored. In Rae Bareli, Priyanka had taken a jibe at Narendra Modi saying UP didn't need any "adopted son" as it has sons of its own, days after the PM claimed to be the adopted son of the state. 
 
 Sharma hit out at the UP government for "lack of action" against SP MLA Verma, who has been booked for the murder of a woman who had earlier accused him of raping her. Verma is a sitting MLA and the woman, who had accused him of raping her, was found dead under mysterious circumstances recently. "It was unfortunate Rahul and Priyanka targeted PM Narendra Modi but said nothing about such serious allegations against SP candidates," Sharma said.
