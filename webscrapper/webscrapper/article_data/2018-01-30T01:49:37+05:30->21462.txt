NEW DELHI: Over 100   were delayed and three diverted on Monday morning after the visibility fell to near zero at   airport, resulting in a backlog. However, there were no cancellations, an airport official said. The flight operations were disrupted for nearly three hours from 6.30am after the runway visual range (RVR) fell below 100m, the officials added.

 Airport met official said the runway visual range was hovering between 100m and 150m from 6.30am and the conditions returned to normal only around 9am. “CAT-IIIA and B procedures were initiated as visibility fell below 100m at one point. Flight operations were severely affected for 3 hours,” said a met official.
 
 Flights cannot take-off when the visibility is below 125m, while landings can take place even when it is around 50m. Flight operations have been affected for the past several days, owing to airspace restrictions till January 26 and dense fog. Forecast for Tuesday, however, shows improvement with ‘shallow to moderate’  , an official said.
 
 IGI airport witnesses around 67 air traffic movements per hour between 8am and 11pm daily. On average, it handles around 1,300 flights each day.
