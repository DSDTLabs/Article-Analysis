HYDERABAD: Known for courting controversies,   of state for   Ramdas Athawale said on Monday members of the   should not wear a sari. 

  "They are not men, they are not women, but they are human... why should they wear a sari when they are not women?" Athawale told reporters. When asked what dress   should wear, he said: "They can wear pant and shirt. They should be wearing men's dress." 
 
 The minister said he made this suggestion at a meeting he held with members of the transgender community in the morning. "My feeling is this. Everybody (transgenders) should not wear a sari," he said.
 
 Athawale said there are nearly six lakh transgenders in India and the Centre is taking several steps for upliftment of the community. "They complained to me about the harassment they face when they go to school or in other walks of life. The Centre will introduce a Bill in the next session of Parliament that will give transgenders their due rights and protection," he said. The minister said a proposal to set up special schools for transgenders could be considered on the lines of schools set up for other disadvantaged communities.
