HYDERABAD: The   (HMR) will have its integrated master plan in next few weeks. After final touches to the blueprint,   (HMDA) sought permission from the municipal administration and   to release the draft plan. 

 HMDA undertook an exercise to integrate all separate master plans for bringing uniformity in land use and zoning regulations apart from incorporating features. Before taking up the task, the Authority invited suggestions from people, developers, urban planners and stakeholders. 
 
 "The draft master plan will soon be released after getting clearance from the state government. Citizens have been given a month to submit objections and suggestions on the draft plan for making changes and rectifications," HMDA metropolitan commissioner   told TOI.
 
 Officials said integration of master plans was necessitated as different regions have different zoning regulations and land use, which has become a problem while granting permissions to new buildings.
 
 Official sources said the main feature of integrated master plan is bringing all plans on a single platform with aid of geographical information system features. Citizens in near future would able to get land use details of a particular survey number and also check whether they get permission for a house on the click of a mouse.
 
 The government asked HMDA to earmark areas for major projects such as Information Technology   Region and Hyderabad-Warangal Industrial Corridor. Interestingly, HMDA earmarked some locations as 'No Development Area'. This would be used for disaster management when necessary.
