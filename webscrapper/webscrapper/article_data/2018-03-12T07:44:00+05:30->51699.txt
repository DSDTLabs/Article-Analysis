PHAGWARA: Protesting against no provision of an underpass during the six-laning of   bypass at the existing crossing outside Palahi village, sarpanches, panchayat members and residents of some villages staged a dharna on the road on Sunday. A two-hour dharna, which may include blocking of the road, on Monday has also been announced by the villagers. 

 The widening of the bypass is part of the six-laning of the Phagwara-Ropar highway. There are quite a few crossings on the around 9km-long bypass, which connects village link roads to Phagwara. However, as the six-laning is being undertaken, most of these crossings would be closed, including the one outside Palahi village, even as the link road passing through the village connects several villages with Phagwara.
 
 As some rural leaders and villagers started the dharna, former   minister Joginder Singh Mann also reached there and said that the project was being shabbily designed and would create permanent problems for residents of the villages as well as of Phagwara. He said that by not caring two hoots for villagers the   ( ) was callously blocking the connectivity with villages.
 
 Activist  , who also addressed the dharna, said that the link road of the village was connecting the town with Adampur, where a domestic airport was scheduled to be started soon. “This road further connects over 50 villages with Phagwara but with no provision of an underpass people will have to take a long way and they may also resort to crossing the main carriageway at wrong places. The NHAI officials have not taken into account the fact that children, pedestrians and cyclists would also cross the road but they appear to be concerned only about cars,” he argued.
 
 Other speakers pointed out that even the civil hospital at Phagwara was on the   road and there were quite a few schools and other educational institutes.
