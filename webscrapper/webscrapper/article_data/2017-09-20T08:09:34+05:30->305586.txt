KOLKATA: It was an eminently forgettable outing for Australia in Chennai on Sunday as they went one-down in the five-match ODI series against India. Their bowlers let India get out of jail as   (83) and   (79) came together at 87/5 and built up a match-winning stand of 118 runs.

 Australian spinner   felt they got the 'length' wrong the other night. “Bowling the right length is very important in India since the grounds here are a bit smaller,” he said. “In Australia you can probably get away even by messing up your length a little bit purely because of the bigger size of the grounds there, but not here,” he added.
 
 The legspinner learnt it the hard way on Sunday. “I pride myself on bowling well under pressure, but the other day I did not execute it too well,” he confessed. Pandya hit Zampa for three consecutive sixes to collect 24 runs in the 37th over of the Indian innings. “As soon as you falter against a player like Hardik, it's going to go the distance,” Zampa quipped.
 
 The 25-year-old hoped to put the Chennai mauling (10-0-66-1) behind him in the second ODI at   on Thursday. “It's good as long as you don't put yourself under too much pressure and learn from those situations,” he said. “Hopefully I will get him (Pandya) out earlier next time.”
 
 Zampa had the good fortune of playing with Dhoni for Pune in IPL. But on Sunday, he was at the receiving end of Dhoni's willow power. “MS has obviously done it for a long time and probably played a lot of innings under pressure like that. The way he has timed his knocks in his whole career is something unique,” he said.
