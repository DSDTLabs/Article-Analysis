CHARMINAR: Lack of attention towards Mufeed Ul Anam boys high school at   road in Old City, is triggering health alarms, as unattended garbage bins and electric transformer cables at the entrance to the institution have become a nightmare for students and school staff. 

 School authorities told TOI that piles of garbage and dangling cables next to the school gate are a huge worry for students. Though Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( ) and other officials concerned were requested to relocate the waste bin and electric transformers many times, only temporary actions were taken yet. 
 
 "Established in the   era, this school has produced many outstanding students. I have been working in this institution since 1990 and it is one of the oldest institutions in Hyderabad. But negligence of GHMC has been a big problem for students. During the rainy season, the students have to face a lot of difficulties due to filth," said  , headmaster of the school.
 
 Objecting to the unhygienic conditions in front of the school, the students complained that they have to suffer a lot due to the foul smell and garbage at the entrance. "Many people prefer to dump their waste before our school due to the presence of garbage bins. We are forced to enter the school covering our noses and at the same time avoid stepping on garbage lying around. Though the school management has written many letters and given complaints personally, the problems still persist," said a Class 10 student. 
 
 School authorities appealed to GHMC commissioner and   officials for immediate relocation of garbage bins and electric transformer.
