Not even in his dreams ace comedian   must have imagined that his 
  from   could cost him dearly. His show, The   Sharma Show, which was up for renewal this month and involved a whopping Rs 106-crore deal, will apparently not be renewed is the latest buzz. And now, the Timesofindia.com has learnt that The Kapil Sharma Show has got one month extension from the channel.
 
  Says a source, the channel has given Kapil Sharma one month time to put up everything together, if he manages to do so the channel will think about continuing with the show. However, looking at the 
  this seems highly impossible for Kapil as  , Chandan Prabhakar, Ali Asgar and Sugandha Mishra are not in any mood to return.
  
  The channel (Sony Entertainment Television) is forced to take this step as these actors have not only refused to shoot, but the ratings of the last two episodes have also been badly hurt by their absence.
  
  Furthermore, Kapil is trying hard to fill in the vacuum created by Sunil's absence on The Kapil Sharma Show. He has even brought Raju Shrivastav on the comedy show, but the veteran comedian has till now not been able to create any magic.
  
  
 
  
  Sunil has already denied the reports of coming back to The Kapil Sharma Show or signing any other show. He is currently busy with live shows.
  
  For the uninitiated, the fight between Kapil and Sunil took place when they were returning after performing stage shows in Melbourne and Sydney. Kapil under the influence of alcohol was using foul language in front of the ladies in an Air India flight, when Sunil tried to calm him down he started abusing and also hit him with a shoe.
