Surat: Two sisters, who studied engineering, have chosen to spread khadi products, promote zero waste packaging and work for segregation of waste at source among the youths instead of joining their father’s jari business. Priyanshi Jariwala and Priyanka Jariwala are working to break traditional barriers to carve a niche for themselves as entrepreneurs despite opposition from within their family. Eldest sister Priyanka started her journey by joining Saahas, an organization which works for zero waste lifestyle. Priyanshi, who also studied at Entrepreneurship Development of India (EDI), Ahmedabad started khadi cult to promote khadi among youths aged 18 to 30.  “It is a challenge to make youngsters accept khadi, a hand woven fabric. I started making designs on Khadi which could appeal to younger generation and in one year I see that they have caught their imagination not only in the country but abroad too. Many didn’t know it is environmental friendly and zero carbon fabric,” Priyanshi, the 24-year-old owner of a start-up, said.  Priyanka deals with zero waste packaging business. She said, “Our city needs recycling plants and we should promote segregation of wet and dry waste collection at source. Packaging bags to visiting cards and letterheads to toilet rolls, everything can be made from recycled products. I provide these materials and show people ways to make them for the benefit of the community.”  Entrepreneurs like them find the going tough in a tradition-bound city like Surat. This is because here traditional family businesses take precedence over everything. However, these two daughters of Dipak Jariwala are bent upon establishing themselves as successful entrepreneurs in new segments which are not yet high revenue yielding in Surat.
