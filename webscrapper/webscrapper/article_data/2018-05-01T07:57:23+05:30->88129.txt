JAIPUR: The state   on Monday disputed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim that every village in the country has been electrified. Terming the claim as baseless, Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president   said that electricity as yet to reach more than seven crore households across the country.

 The Congress leader said 86,906 villages had been electrified under the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana in the UPA tenure, while just around 14,000 villages have been electrified under the NDA government.
 
 “The truth is, as per rural electrification corporation, more than seven crore and five lakh households in the nation are still to receive electricity,” Pilot said in a press statement. He added, “The ground reality is that against BJP’s promise to provide 8-hrs electricity to farmers and one-phase electricity all 24-hrs to rural areas, the farmers are getting power for only 2 to 4 hours a day, while the 24-hr power in rural areas has turned out to be a hollow talk.”
 
 The Congress leader questioned the state BJP government’s claims too about 100% electrification. “In Jodhpur Discom area, 18,000 households are yet to receive electricity. In   area, more than 8,000 villages are awaiting electricity. Similarly, electricity is still to reach 4,500 hamlets with less than 100 households,” Pilot said, adding that even   was far from achieving complete electrification in its jurisdiction area.
 
 “In urban areas, people are forced to go without power for hours together even in intense summers. There is no regular power supply in any big city, including Jaipur. The claim about repairing transformers within 24-hrs is baseless. This shows that there is no truth in 99% of the claims that the BJP governments make,” said Pilot.
