CHENNAI: Death of a woman in a road accident, caused by the banned  , has rekindled safety issues and spurred social activist   to seek contempt action against officials. In 2008 it was on Ramaswamy's PIL that high court banned such fish carts.

 Fish carts are locally assembled commercial vehicles that use, mostly, stolen motorbike engines, and used for carrying cargo ranging from fish to vegetable to unwieldy metal bars. They ruled the city roads till 2008, and they had no licence, insurance or registration. Its drivers too had no valid driving licence. Its victims could not claim any insurance since they were not vehicles recognized under insurance laws, and registered under motor vehicles rules.
 
 Citing all these illegalities, Ramaswamy fought PIL proceedings resulting in their outright ban in January 2008.
 
 Now, citing the Tuesdayâ€™s accident involving a fish cart in North Chennai, where one woman identified as Saraswathi was killed, Ramaswamy filed a contempt of court plea against home secretary, transport commissioner, Chennai city commissioner of police and traffic police personnel. He mentioned the matter before the first bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar, which asked him to get the matter listed for hearing.
 
 Ramaswamy told TOI that he had mentioned the contempt issue for at least half a dozen times before various benches. The matter will be taken up for hearing on Thursday.
