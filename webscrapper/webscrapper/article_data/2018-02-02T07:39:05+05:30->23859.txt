Tamil Nadu’s contribution to Union taxes will increase thise financial year by 31% of the sum in fiscal 2016-17. This is due to an increase in direct as well as   for the Centre. Tamil Nadu receives 4.02% of the Centre’s total allocation from tax revenue each year, as per the 14th Financial Commission recommendations.

 Though Tamil Nadu opposed the 14th commission recommendations as the percentage of its tax share decreased from the allotment by the previous commission, the state has actually been receiving more money each year.
 
 The latest budget shows that Tamil Nadu’s tax share will be ₹31,707.09 crore, compared to ₹27,099.72 crore under the revised budget for 2017-18 and ₹23,986.85 crore in 2016-17.
 
 Though the allocation percentage has decreased by 0.946% under the 14th  , the state will get more money in absolute terms from the Centre as the total percentage for sharing the   for all states increased to 42% from 32%. “Apart from the tax share, we will have to get grants from the central government. But that has been delayed for several years. We have been asking the Centre to release pending funds so our financial burden will decrease,” said an official.
