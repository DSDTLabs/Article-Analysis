GANDHINAGAR: The city police on Wednesday publicly shamed the men who had allegedly stabbed a   in Odhav last week. The accused had their palms joined in the ‘namaste’ gesture and were paraded in public.

 City crime branch sleuths on Monday had arrested four persons for robbing the trader, Jayesh Shah, at knife-point and then stabbing him on the hand in Odhav on May 2. Among the arrested were Ketan Bhalsev of Odhav, Majidkhan Pathan and Zakir Shah of Behrampura, and Ranasinh Rav of Vastral. Senior police officials said that the four were taken out in public and made to do squats. “We had also taken the accused to the steel trader’s office and made them beg for forgiveness,” a senior police official said.
 
 According to police sources, Ketan used to work in company adjoining Jayesh Steel Traders located at Jay Mangal estate in Odhav. Sources said that while Ketan and Ranasinh kept a watch, Zakir and Majid barged into the office of Shah. “They robbed him of Rs 3.5 lakh and sped away on a bike,” an investigator said.
