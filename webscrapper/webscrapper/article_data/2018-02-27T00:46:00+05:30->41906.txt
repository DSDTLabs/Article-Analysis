Tuticorin: A detailed project report (DPR) is being prepared to divert a portion of excess water in Godavari river to Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema region, Union minister for water resources, river development and for Ganga rejuvenation, Nitin   has said. 

 Pointing out the importance of irrigation for agriculture, Gadkari said that 10,000 farmers from Vidarbha region in Maharashtra had committed suicide due to lack of water for crops. He added that 3,000 tmc water from Godavari was flowing into the sea.
 
 The minister added that under this ambitious river linking project, Cauvery river would get 175 tmc – which was almost equal to the present share of 177.25 tmc — earmarked by the Supreme Court for Tamil Nadu from the Cauvery. Gadkari said the project would benefit even those living in the tail-ends of the state.
 
 Earlier,, minister for information and publicity C Kadambur Raju appealed to Gadkari and the Centre to act according to their conscience so that Tamil Nadu got its rightful share in Cauvery, Siruvani and Mullaperiyar from the neighbouring states in an unbiased manner.
