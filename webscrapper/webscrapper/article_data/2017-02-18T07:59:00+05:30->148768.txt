GURUGRAM: Taking cues from the criticism received after failing to deliver the promise of bringing 500   on the city’s roads by September 2015,   are tight-lipped currently with regards to the introduction of more buses.

 Official sources, however, told TOI the MCG is planning to launch around 250   this year. Gurgaon currently has 127 registered city buses. Out of these, only 62 ply on roads.
 
 Moreover, the locations for bus stops across the city have been identified. But the   where these vehicles will be parked are yet to be identified. 
 
 The first announcement for the city buses was one-and-a-half years ago, and the buses were promised for September 2015. However, when nothing happened at ground level and the commuters struggle without an affordable public transport, the corporation received a lot of flak. 
 
 Sources told TOI that MCG is working on launching at least 250 buses in the first phase. Ideally there should be a bus stop at every two kilometres in the city. For a city like Gurgaon, at least around 200 bus stops are required. For now, 131 sites have been identified across Gurgaon where bus stops will be built. “These sites have been identified after survey and the tenders have been allotted for these bus stops. These bus queue shelters will be built at these identified locations, including MG Road, sectors 23, 17, 40 and 45, Sohna Road, and old Gurgaon,” said Vivek Kalia, MCG joint commissioner. 
 
 Surprisingly, while such extensive planning is underway, the corporation still hasn’t identified the locations for the bus depots. In a city as wide as Gurgaon, at least four bus depots in four corners of the city are required.
