KARUR: Deputy general secretary of   ( ), T T V   has demanded a   inquiry into the issue in which a woman professor was arrested for seeking sexual favours from students.

 “The professor said in the audio that she knows several big shots and the governor. The person in question constituted the commission in a hurry. It raises a question whether the committee is necessary. On the other hand, the inquiry by the CB-CID will not be fair. So, a CBI inquiry under the supervision of the high court should be ordered,” Dhinakaran told reporters in   on Wednesday after staging a demonstration over Cauvery row. 
 
 He also condemned the governor for constituting a commission independently. “The governor had no authority to form a commission. It is unethical to involve in the administration while the rule of elected government is in force. His intrusion happens as the Edappadi government is cowed down,” charged Dhinakaran.
 
 The AMMK leader also criticised the central government for bringing in methane, neutrino and Kudankulam projects which the people are opposing. “Any project inimical to the interests of the people should not be allowed. The delta districts should be declared as a protected zone,” he said. 
 
 Speaking at the demonstration, Dhinakaran attacked state transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar for hiking the bus fare. “While we have been staging several protests over Cauvery management board issue, the state government indulged in burdening the people with price hike. The transport minister gave a shock to the people by increasing the bus fare by 60 per cent,” said Dhinakaran. 
 
 He claimed that the state will soon witness an election and the two leaves will be retrieved from the AIADMK.
