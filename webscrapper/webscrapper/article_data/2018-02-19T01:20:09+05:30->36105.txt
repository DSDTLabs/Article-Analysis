GURUGRAM: Thirteen days since it became operational from temporary premises,   (H-Rera) Gurgaon is yet to start taking action on the over 300 complaints from homebuyers it has received so far, because of delay in appointing a judicial officer as ‘registrar’.

 The rule states a retired judicial officer of rank district judge or additional district judge need to be appointed as   registrar, who would be responsible for registering complaints and issuing notices, based on which the H-Rera chairman and members will conduct hearing to address the grievance. 
 
 Without a registrar, H-Rera is unable to register complaints (currently it is only receiving complaints) or issues notices — the first step in addressing homebuyer’s grievances.
 
  
  
 So far, six law graduates have been appointed in H-Rera to scrutinise complaints and help complainants format their complaints properly. Complaints need to be filed as writ petitions, with copies for all three H-Rera members, one for the office and separate copies for each respondent.
 
 The authority has fixed a 60-day deadline for addressing a complaint, but till now, hasn’t been able start work on resolving any grievances. “We’ll start resolving issues soon,” said a H-Rera Gurgaon official, without elaborating on the appointment of a registrar.
 
 A homebuyer who has been waiting for H-Rera to become functional, said, “The wait is getting longer.” 
 
 After notifying the H-Rera Rule in July 2017, the   government took several months to nominate chairpersons and members of the authority, which were finally announced in November 2017. “We then had to wait for the nominees to assume charge, which they finally did on February 5,” said homebuyer  , adding they were expecting the authority will be up and running from its launch.
