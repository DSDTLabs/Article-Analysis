AGARTALA: At least 25 people were injured in mob violence at Gandacherra in Dhalai district on Wednesday during a dawn-to-dusk general strike called by All   Indigenous Regional Parties Forum (ATRPF) in tribal autonomous areas. 

 The strike had been called in protest against the Centre's move to amend the Citizenship Act. 
 
 At least five of the injured were shifted to   in a serious condition. The Dhalai district administration clamped prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC in Gandacherra.
 
 The protesters ransacked more than 20 shops at Gandacherra, Manu and Khowai when shopkeepers opened shutters defying the strike. A few vehicles were also damaged. Bandh leaders accused the ruling CPM of resorting to unprovoked attack on picketeers.
 
 DGP K Nagraj said around 3,400 protestors had courted arrest in different parts of the state. The   cancelled all trains to and from Agartala. 
 
 Chief executive member of the autonomous council,  , alleged that the strike was politically motivated and provocative. "We, the Leftists, are also against the amendment of the Citizenship Act. But calling a strike in Tripura will have no effect. The strike will encourage divisive forces without serving any purpose," said Debbarma.
