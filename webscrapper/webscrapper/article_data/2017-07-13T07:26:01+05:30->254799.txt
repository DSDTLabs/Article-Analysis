NEW DELHI: Congress vice-president   launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, saying his policies have "created space for terrorists" in Kashmir and cost India strategically. 

 With #AmarnathTerror Attack, the Congress vice-president lashed out at the PM over the increasing number of terror attacks in the valley. 
 
 "Modi's policies have created the space for terrorists in Kashmir. Grave strategic blow for India," Gandhi said in a series of tweets.
 
 Rahul imitated the PM's style of describing his achievements in mathematical equations and said growing terrorism in J&K was the fallout of BJP aligning with the People's Democratic Party (PDP) to form government in the state.
 
 "Short-term political gain for Modi from the PDP alliance has cost India massively. Modi's personal gain=India's strategic loss + sacrifice of innocent Indian blood," he said. 
 
 Rahul's latest salvo came two days after seven Amarnath pilgrims were killed when terrorists attacked their bus in Anantnag district.
 
  He had called the attack a "grave and unacceptable security lapse" for which the PM needed to "accept responsibility and never allow it to happen again". Congress questioned PM's silence and asked whether the government will fix responsibility. "No amount of chest-thumping, false bravado and TV studio warfare can now be an escape route for BJP to hide its massive failures," said AICC spokesman Abhishek Singhvi. 
 
  He said, "Merely tweeting on Kashmiriyat and replying to a troll will not absolve the home minister of the responsibility to maintain peace and tranquillity." Singhvi said since BJP came to power, India only has a "part time" defence minister or "reluctant" defence minister, which is a sad commentary on the state of affairs that are endangering our national security.
