MANGALURU: State BJP minority morcha vice-president   on Wednesday took umbrage at continuous efforts by vested interests to target him personally. Rahim, also the former president of Karnataka Beary Sahitya Academy, said the latest attempt to portray him ‘non-Muslim’ following a recent courtesy meeting with Vishvesha Tirtha swami of Adhokshaja Pejavar Math and spread personal canards about him is the last straw that he can possibly bear.

 Expressing anguish at the language and comments about him on a Facebook page ‘Mangalore Muslims’ following the incident, Rahim told reporters on Wednesday that their derogatory comments have gone viral and he is facing a tough time answering calls from well-wishers and handling threat calls from the fringe within his community. “I am being judged by individuals taking refuge in the anonymity that social media offers them and not by clerics,” he lamented.
 
 Noting that police have not registered an FIR on his complaints stating that they need permission from the court to do so, Rahim while reposing faith in   city police wondered if they are being directed not to act against his perpetrators because of his political affiliation. “The people abusing me over WhatsApp, spreading obnoxious voice-clips are all real people and yet police are not able to locate them based on their phone numbers and this is indeed strange,” he said.
 
 Defending his decision not to involve the party in trying to bring pressure on the authorities to act, Rahim said he had approached the police as a citizen seeking justice to the injustice being meted out to him. “If you want to kill me, do so once, but please give me a valid reason (for such action),” he said adding the only demand of his detractors is that he leave the BJP. City police has provided him with a gunman after a failed murder attempt on him while heading the academy.
