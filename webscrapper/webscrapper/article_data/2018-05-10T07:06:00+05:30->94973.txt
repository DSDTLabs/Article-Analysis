LUDHIANA: Days after demanding a dope test for Punjab Police personnel,   (LIP) supremo and Atam Nagar MLA Simarjit Singh Bains has once again lashed out at the Punjab Police. This time, he has raked up the issue of illegal possession of nine flats in Dugri by police officials for keeping old records of the Dugri police station, which was earlier located in these flats, but shifted to Dugri Phase 2 a few years ago. Levelling allegations of harassment of flat owners by police, Bains shot off a letter to the director-general of police and other senior police officials, demanding that the cops vacate the flats, besides action against police officials responsible for the lapse.

 
 Speaking to TOI on the issue, Bains said: “Twenty-five years ago, these flats were illegally occupied by the police, and a police chowki was established here, but a few years ago, it was converted into a full-fledged police station, and shifted to a new building in Phase-2. All the staff and furniture was shifted to the new site, but even then the flats were not vacated. Police officials did not return the flats to the rightful owners on the pretext that they had no space to keep old records and case properties. It is very unfortunate that in the flats in which there are no records or case properties, police personnel are living in them and not vacating them.”
 
 Bains also added: “I have already forwarded a complaint to the   ( ) and the Ludhiana police commissioner, but no action has been taken on my complaint. Therefore, I decided to take up the matter with   and DGP Law & Order, and seek justice for innocent people, who are still not able to take possession of their own property.”
 
 Meanwhile, speaking to TOI on the issue, police commissioner Dr Sukhchain Singh Gill said: “We will definitely examine the issue, and appropriate action will be taken accordingly once we come to know about the real facts.”
