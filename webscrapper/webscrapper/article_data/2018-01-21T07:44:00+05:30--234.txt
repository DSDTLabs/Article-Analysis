Ludhiana: From a trainee at the cycling velodrome at Punjab Agricultural University to an international-level cyclist, 19-year-old Anil Manglow has achieved a lot.

 Continuing his superb journey, Anil won two medals in the ongoing all-India Inter University Track Cycling Competition at PAU (cycling velodrome).
 
 Anil, who has represented India in two international-level cycling events, won gold medal in 4-km individual pursuit event. On Friday, he won a silver medal in 15km scratch race event. 
 
 Having won two medals in recently organised Track Cycling Asia Cup held at Indira Gandhi Stadium in New Delhi in October, Anil Manglow showed his disappointment in not winning gold in 15km scratch race event.
 
 “I remember my initial training days when I started my sporting career at PAU cycling velodrome three years back under the guidance of Gurbaj Singh,” said Anil, who is currently getting training from National Institute of Sports in Patiala, one of the best institutes in the country.
 
 “Having won two international medals in the past one year, my confidence level has gone up tremendously. Now I am preparing myself for upcoming Commonwealth Games 2018 which will kick off in Australia in March,” he said.
 
 “As cycling is a costly sport, players like us have to face a lot of trouble especially during the initial training days. It becomes really difficult to purchase a well-equipped cycle for training.”
 
 “I also come from weaker section of society as my father is a daily wager in Haryana and mother is a house wife,” Anil added.
 
 “I have not gone to my village in Fatehabad (Haryana) for past eight months to meet my family. I know it’s crucial time of my life as I have to train daily for five to six hours for the upcoming Commonwealth Games,” stated by Anil.
 
 “During last year’s Commonwealth Games, I failed to win medals in road time trial and road mustard race event,” said Anil.
