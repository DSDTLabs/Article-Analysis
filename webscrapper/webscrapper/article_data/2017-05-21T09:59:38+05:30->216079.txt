AURANGABAD: Several investors on Saturday reached the   Wing of the city police complaining about a Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) investment firm, which has reportedly closed down its office in the city.

 Falling for the scam, each of them invested a sum ranging from Rs 50,000 to a few lakh, taking the total invested amount to several crores.
 
 The EOW sleuths on Saturday have collected the investment certificates provided by the firm to the investors against the amount deposited by people in the past few years.
 
 The investment firm has several branches across the state, including Aurangabad, Nagpur, Pune and Mumbai.
 
 When contacted, Aurangabad commissioner of police  , citing the initial stage of the probe, refused to comment on the case. But said that the police would take stringent action against the accused once they are found guilty of committing the offence.
 
 A senior EOW officer told TOI, “A complaint against this firm has already reached the   Board of India (Sebi), which is likely to take a call on the activities of this firm by month end.”
 
 The officer said that after receiving complaint against the firm, Sebi conducted a primary inquiry, seized the firm’s bank accounts that had considerable amount of money and the possibility of these people getting back their money is quite high.
