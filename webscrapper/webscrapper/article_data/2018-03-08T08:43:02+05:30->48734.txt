 Gujarat Refinery executive director (ED), Sudhir Kumar said that the government has given them a deadline of April 2020 for supplying BS VI fuel. “We are investing in the refinery to upgrade the fuel supply but we will also keep flexibility and adjust according to the demand.” The   Refinery has also planned to sign a MOU with the   (VMC) for buying the treated water from its sewage treatment plant (STP).
 
 “We plan to buy the treated water from the Chhani STP. Currently they release the water in Mahi River. We can buy the water and use it for industrial purpose. We may need more water after the expansion plans. This will help us in saving water and also benefit the environment. Other industries too can follow the same model,” Kumar said. The VMC will have to lay a 9-km pipeline to supply the water to the refinery.
