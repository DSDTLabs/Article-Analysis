NOIDA: As the city faced flooding after Thursday morning’s showers, Noida Authority officials said they were planning to put an emergency response system in place for the next monsoon. 

 The Authority will hire experts to design an urban anti-waterlogging plan, which will ensure the city does not go under water again, officials told TOI.
 
 R K Mishra, ACEO, Noida Authority, said the plan would deal with any heavy downpour. “Stormwater management and waterlogging prevention are inadequate and need to be addressed or else the city will incur losses from flooding and precious lives will be at stake,” Mishra said.
 
 “We will invite experts to help us draw up an emergency plan so that the city does not get waterlogged. This was decided after our CEO, Amit Mohan Prasad, inspected the city for two-and-a-half hours on Thursday morning after the heavy downpour,” he said.
 
 Mishra said, “The CEO directed all teams from JAL and sewerage departments, besides seven other teams who were touring the city after the heavy rain, to help clear the water from the roads by pumping it out, and clearing debris and desilting drains, etc, he has emphasised the need to hire experts to deal with the issue in the future.”
 
 “All teams of officials have been asked to identify trouble spots in their respective work circles. They have also been asked to make appropriate notes, which will be shared with the experts so that they are able to design a water-tight plan,” he said. 
 
 “The aim is to establish a sustainable system before the next monsoon sets in,” he said.
