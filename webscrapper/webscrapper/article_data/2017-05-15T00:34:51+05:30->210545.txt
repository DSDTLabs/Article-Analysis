Trichy: A team of doctors at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) here have successfully removed a two-feet long iron rod which was lodged in a woman’s body. Her husband, a habitual drunkard, had stabbed the woman with the iron rod in a fit of rage during an altercation. 

 As the rod did not cause damage to any vital organs, she escaped without any risky surgery and her condition was stable.
 
 According to police, Palaniyandi, 29, native of Kungumapuram in Vazhavanthankottai near Thuvakudi, used to regularly get into a verbal altercation with his wife P Meena, 23. On Friday after he picked up a quarrel with his wife, she left with her three children to her parent’s house located in the same area.
 
 Palaniyandi went to his in-laws house on Saturday and again created a ruckus. During the course of argument, Palaniyandi picked a sharp iron rod - used to hunt rats - and stabbed Meena. The rod pierced her stomach and was protruding from the left side of her hip. He fled the scene. 
 
 Shocked neighbours and parents rushed her to the government hospital at Thuvakudi from where she was referred to MGMGH for further treatment. A team of doctors headed by surgeon Dr Shanthi performed the surgery for more than an hour and successfully removed the iron rod. 
 
 Meanwhile, on the basis of a complaint lodged with Thuvakudi police, a case was registered and Palaniyandi was arrested. Further investigations are on, police said.
