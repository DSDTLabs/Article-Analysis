HYDERABAD: In a statement on Friday, Jana   (JSP) vice-president   urged his party men as well as followers and fans of party president   Kalyan not to react emotionally to any criticism against the actor or the party by anyone. 

 His appeal comes after film critic-director   approached the police alleging attacks against him by   fans. In the last few months, the actors fans have been practically at war with Mahesh Kathi on social media, and offline, for his criticism of Kalyan.
 
 Reddy asked fans to recall Kalyan's statement on October 7, 2017, asking partymen and fans to reign in their emotions.   had said some individuals had resorted to criticising him to make a name for themselves by levelling personal allegations. He said the party was formed to take up peoples issues, and it would would not allow itself to be diverted from its goal by planned criticism.
 
 "If you cannot do good for the party, at least do not harm it. The party is observing the goings on. At the right time, it will react and in an appropriate manner. We will conduct ourselves with dignity," Pavan had pleaded in the older statement.
