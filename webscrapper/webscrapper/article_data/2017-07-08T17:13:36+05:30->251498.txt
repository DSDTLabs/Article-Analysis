HYDERABAD: The   (TDP) on Saturday demanded that the state government fulfil its promises on the filling up of vacancies in various government departments. To begin with, the government should learn from the neighbouring   on how to finish a recruitment process once it begins, the opposition partyâ€™s   unit working president A Revanth Reddy said.

 In an open letter to chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, Revanth Reddy said the   government which in early 2016 began the recruitment process of police officers and constables, had completed it by February of this year. However, Telangana which launched a similar exercise to fill 570 posts of sub-inspectors(SI) of police in February 2016, is yet to complete the process.
 
 The government, Revanth Reddy said needs to explain the reasons for the delays in completing the recruitment process. He also demanded that the government announce that it will complete the pending work related to filling up of the 570 posts in the next fortnight.
 
 The TRS made a promise that it will fill more than a lakh vacancies in the government and used this as a major poll promise. But like many other of its promises, the TRS government has forgotten about this, Revanth Reddy said in his letter.
