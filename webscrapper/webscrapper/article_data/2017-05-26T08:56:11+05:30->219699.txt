NEW DELHI: The procedure for   to   through   (ECA) quota is different in many ways this year. It is aimed at being more student-friendly and it will give them a chance to compete on the basis of their abilities instead of just the certificates they hold.

 Students think it is good that they are only expected to submit one certificate in the mandatory uploads section while filling up the online registration form.
 
 The director of ECA admission, Shalini, said that though students have to submit just one certificate online, they will be allowed to change or bring the certificate at a later date during verification. “Aspirants will be given another chance in case they are seen to be good performers. We will judge them on the basis of their certificates along with the trials,” she said.
 
 Shalini added that the venues of trials are being prepared in such a way that aspirants appearing for more than one will find it easy to commute. “There are 14 venues where trials will be conducted. We are planning to time the trials in such a way that popular categories like debate and performing arts are conducted on dates close to each other,” said the director.
 
 If an aspirant feels that the dates of trials are clashing, they can approach the panel of judges and get them rescheduled. The competition for ECA seats is usually high. Last year, around 12,000 applications were received for 865 seats.
