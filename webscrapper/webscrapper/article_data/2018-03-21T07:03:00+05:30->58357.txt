GREATER NOIDA: The Active Citizens Group (ACG) on behalf of commuters submitted a memorandum to the   on Tuesday demanding construction of a   crossing near   area. The crossing, according to residents, is accident-prone due to faulty planning. ACEO K K Gupta assured action on the matter.

 “The Vishwa Bharati crossing near Knowledge Park is accident- prone due to the faulty planning by Greater Noida Authority. The crossing is open from all four sides and there is no regulation of vehicular movement in the absence of any street light. Since there are many colleges around the area, the crossing also faces daily   jams during peak hours. We have been demanding a roundabout in the area for th epast couple of years,” said Harinder Bhati, member Active Citizens Group (ACG).
 
 According to Alok Singh, founder, ACG, being a busy intersection, the need for a roundabout is immediate for smooth run of vehicles without any possibility of an accident. “Since Greater Noida Authority had its solution day, we gave a memorandum for a roundabout on the said crossing so as to ensure prevention of accidents occurring at the crossing almost every day,” said Singh.
 
 While ACEO K K Gupta assured that action will be initiated soon, he maintained ground report almost ready on the area. The ACG team included Anil Chaudhary, Om Raizada, Sunil Kumar and Rahul Nambardar.
