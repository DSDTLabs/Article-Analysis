GANDHINAGAR: Though the   claims to be spending higher amounts for improving the stateâ€™s  , the reality is that it is gradually reducing the percentage of budget allocated for healthcare. It has reduced the   for healthcare from 5.59% of total budget in 2015-16 to 5.40% in the revised budget of 2016-17 and now to 5.06% in 2017-18. 

 On the surface, the per-capita expense in the healthcare sector has increased due to increase in the overall budget size, but allocation for the healthcare sector in the budget and spending in proportion to the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) is going down year after year.
 
 Globally, the percentage of GSDP spent on the health and education is considered a key parameter of human development in a state.
 
 The Gujarat government has also reduced overall spending in the healthcare sector in comparison to the GSPC. In 2016-17, the total spending in healthcare by the Gujarat government was 0.75%, which it has reduced to 0.68% in the 2017-18 budget.
 
 Huge difference has also been observed in the spending between rural and urban healthcare with the latter getting more attention.
 
 According to the official budget publication, the government spent only 29% of the total departmental budget on rural healthcare while it spent a whopping 71% for the urban healthcare. Per capita spending in rural areas projected by the Gujarat government is only Rs 412.24, while for urban areas, the per capita spending is Rs1354.36/-.
 
 Lack of healthcare manpower in the rural sector is also a big challenge. In rural areas, there is an alarming 96.27% posts of physician vacant at community health centres. Medical staff vacancies in other government sectors are also very high.
