KOLKATA: An elderly journalist in   suffered multiple injuries when a youth allegedly tried to hit him with a car when he protested against the accused and his friends for drinking outside his house on Saturday evening. He also tried to stop them from fleeing the spot. 

 The incident took place at AK Block when Manas Ghosh raised voice against a group of five, all in their early twenties, while they were drinking and abusing sitting on the railings of AK Block park. "One of our neighbours, Joydeep  , was the first to protest. He asked the boys not to drink and to behave properly. But they started abusing him. The youths also said they would not stop drinking," said Ghosh, whose house is located right beside the park.
 
 Ghosh said while the youths were abusing Sinha Roy and his wife, he came out in the couple's support and an altercation started between the youths and Ghosh. "They were still abusing us. I also lost my cool and decided to teach them a lesson. So, I called the police," said Ghosh.
 
 Sensing trouble, the youths decided to flee and tried to get inside the Toyota Corolla parked beside the playground. "I stood in front of the car and Sinha Roy tried to take away the keys when a scuffle broke out. The youth on the wheel said that his name was Sudipto and he worked with a Bengali daily. I asked him to show his identity card but he tried to push us and leave the spot," said Ghosh. As he stood in front of the car, the youth allegedly started speeding the car towards Ghosh. "I dived to my left to escape and suffered injuries on my hand, legs, head and abdomen," said Ghosh.
 
 He lodged a complaint with Bidhannagar North police and also gave them the car's registration number. Police were unable to trace the car till late on Sunday and said the person with whom the car was registered had already sold it after which the car changed a few more hands.
