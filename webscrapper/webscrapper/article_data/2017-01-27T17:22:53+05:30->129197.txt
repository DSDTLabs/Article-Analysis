Dulquer Salmaan's latest release   has a lot of specialties ' it will have the youth icon teaming up with master director   for the first time. Also, the movie has several interesting combinations that make it a must watch in theatres. 
We list out the five reasons why the film is a must-see for fans of the family genre:
 
 
 
 
  has been experimenting with different genres in Mollywood. Last year we had tried his hand at thrillers Kali and Kammattipaadam, and so his return to the family drama genre is sure to enthuse the audience. The actor plays a carefree son of a wealthy family and we know when Dulquer takes up a role, he gives it his all.
 
 
 
 Iqbal Kuttipuram's last three movies are Diamond Necklace, Oru Indian Pranayakatha and Vikramadityan. Combine his prowess with master director Sathyan Anthikad's and it would make the perfect family movie. 
 
 
 
 After winning a Filmfare for her power-packed performance in Kakka Muttai, Aishwarya Rajesh has become a household name in South cinema. The actress will make her debut in Malayalam with Jomonte Suvisheshangal and has already bagged the lead role in Nivin Pauly's upcoming movie. Given that Sathyan Anthikad films have a plum role for its heroines, we are sure Aishwarya has chosen a grand launch vehicle.
 
 
 
 Mukesh has played friend to Dulquer's dad Mammootty in several films but the fresh combination of Dulquer and Mukesh as son and father are sure to keep the audience entertained. The camaraderie the duo shared off screen have made news and we are hoping it reflects on the screen as well.
 
 
 
 Jacob Gregory and Dulquer had the audience in splits with their antics in ABCD and 100 Days of Love. The duo will also be sharing screen space in this film and from the posters this would also make for a fun outing together.
