Mumbai: Changing dynamics in the jobs industry appear to be impacting the rewards and   structure. According to a TeamLease’s ‘Compensation & total rewards trends’ report, both   and employers seem to be moving towards total rewards wherein the share of variable pay and flexi-benefits are said to be significant.

 According to the report, variable pay for senior management has risen to 25-30% from 18-20%. There has also been a significant rise in variable pays of middle management (10- 12% earlier to 18-20%) and junior management (05-08% earlier to 10-12%) today.
 
  VP Sonal Arora said, “While flexi-benefits have become a popular medium to please and retain employees, organisations need to be honest with their intent, put earnest effort and prioritise on aligning rewards with business objectives, communicate effectively and personalisation.”
 
 The report said a radical compensation mix — comprising 60-40% fixed-to-variable and 38-85% intangible-to-tangible — is ushering in the total rewards era in India. So, a holistic employee perspective has enhanced spending on recognition to 52% of benefits budgets and on privileges to 55%.
 
 Benefit plans while joining the organisation attract 74% of potential employees, while health/wellness plans, and financial benefits help retain 57% of staff. On the other hand, 68% prefer   and 55% employees are likely to recommend the organisation based on the maternity/paternity benefits, performance bonus and stock options availability.
 
 The report said while the cost to the business in providing flexible benefits is 25% of the total   budget, which in turn is around 10-15% of the employees’ total salary package, the perceived value of these benefits is nearly 42% of the compensation package and hence new-age companies are innovating to keep employees engaged. 
 
 The report said traditional sectors like  , healthcare & pharma,   offer a wide range of options in the compensation & benefits mix, to cater to a broad-based workforce. While new economy businesses like BFSI, e-commerce, IT, telecommunication and FMCG/D have rationalised the benefits mix by stripping it of elements that employees perceive as irrelevant. Sectors like retail, media & entertainment, travel & tourism are seen to be “fun places to work” and thus can make do with a lean compensation & benefits structures.
 
 The report, which covers employees across age, qualification, profession and cities, said 63% of candidates do not prefer a dress code in office.
