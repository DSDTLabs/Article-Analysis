TV actor   feels once the viewers get used to a certain kind of shows, it becomes tough for the makers to experiment on television.
 
  
 
  
  The 28-year-old actor says television appears to be stuck in a "vicious circle" of regressive serials.
  
  "It's (television) a vicious circle. You had progressive shows at one point of time and people used to look upto them. But today the content is going regressive and that's because of the demand of the audience.
  
  "They are fed with a certain kind of content and if the makers suddenly take the risk to experiment, it becomes difficult for them to get acceptance," Rithvik told PTI.
  
  The actor hopes television will come up with better content and some shows have already started moving in the right direction.
  
  "But I am hopeful it (television content) will take a turn and make a comeback with progressive content sooner or later. I think some shows are now liberal in nature," he says.
  
  Rithvik, who starred in popular television shows "Pyaar Kii Ye Ek Kahaani" and "Kumkum Bhagya", says he has been away from the daily soaps as nothing "challenging" was offered to him.
  
  "I was getting a lot of offers (for daily soaps) but there wasn't anything challenging enough for me to do. I also did not want to repeat myself. It's not that I won't do shows but the offer has to be worth doing," Rithvik says.
  
  The actor has been part of several reality shows like "Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa", " ", "I Can Do That" and "Dare 2 Dance".
  
  "There is no formula for winning any show. One just has to be at ease and mentally stable," he adds.
  
  Rithvik, who is an adventure junkie, will next be seen as a contestant on the eighth season of " ".
  
  "It's an interesting format and I had not done something like this before. It was offered to me twice but I couldn't do it due to some reasons. Now, I have the time so I jumped to do it," he says.
