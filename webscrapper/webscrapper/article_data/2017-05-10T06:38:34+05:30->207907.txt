Mumbai/New Delhi: Am-id reports that   politician   might join the   along with his MLA son Neetesh, leader of the Opposition in the assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil on Tuesday asked him to reconsider his decision and lead the Sangharsha Yatra launched by their party for waiver of farmers’ loans.

 “We are not sure if Rane is joining the BJP or otherwise. We feel that Rane should lead the Sangharsha Yatra launched by the Congress for the cause of the farmers. In fact, following massive success of the yatra, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has initiated a series of decisions for the welfare of farmers. In view of the mounting pressure, the date for procurement of tur dal was extended by a month. Rane should consider all these issues and lead the yatra in the Kokan region,” Vikhe Patil told TOI.
 
 The Sangharsh Yatra was launched from March 27. On May 17 and 18, it will move to Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg.
 
 A BJP leader said the Congress politician had merely postponed his plan to cross over after his meeting with BJP president Amit Shah in Fadnavis’s presence was leaked to the media. Rane has denied such a meeting.
 
 The Congress also has a Plan B in case Rane quits the party. Rane met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Friday, and sources said he was bargaining for the reins of the state unit.
 
 The Congress has just one MLA more than the   and if Rane takes along his son and another MLA who is said to be a loyalist, it would put the opposition leader’s post in jeopardy. Rane is a member of the legislative council.
 
 In case Rane defects, the Congress is considering joint action with the NCP and the   to take on Rane, a former Sainik.
 
 Rane’s faction will have to resign from the assembly and council and seek re-election on BJP tickets. The Congress, the NCP and the Shiv Sena may divide the two assembly seats and one council berth among themselves to unitedly take on the Rane faction.
