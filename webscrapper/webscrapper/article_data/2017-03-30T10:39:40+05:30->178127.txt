AURANGABAD: The move by the   (CBSE) to make   as an additional centre to conduct the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for medical admissions has spread cheers among students and parents.

 The new centre is expected to help scores of students from Nanded and Latur districts for taking the May 7 examination.
 
 Since March 31 is the revised last date for changing test city option, educational counsellors have appealed to the aspirants from Nanded and Latur to complete the formalities without delay.
 
 “Going by past experiences in fulfilling such demands, we were not hopeful of any positive decision about Nanded soon. It’s a pleasant surprise. The authorities surely deserve a word of appreciation for their swift action,” said  , mother of a Class XII student from Latur. 
 
 Many candidates and parents were apprehensive that the travel to Aurangabad would be a waste of time and energy ahead of the crucial examination.
 
 Aspirants from Latur would have been especially at the receiving end as it has no effective rail connectivity to Aurangabad. Now, students from Latur have to travel only 118km to Nanded for appearing for the test compared to the earlier travel of 290km to Aurangabad. 
 
 NCP MLC  , who was following the demand for additional NEET centres for Marathwada with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, said Latur should also be a centre from next year onwards. “As NEET has been made mandatory, it is necessary to have at least one more centre at Latur in Marathwada.” 
 
 Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Amravati and Satara were the four cities in the state that have found place in the list of additional centres for NEET announced recently. 
 
 The number of students registered for NEET has increased by 41.2% to 11,35,104 this year compared to 8,02,594 in 2016. This is the highest number of registered candidates for NEET so far, the CBSE has said.
