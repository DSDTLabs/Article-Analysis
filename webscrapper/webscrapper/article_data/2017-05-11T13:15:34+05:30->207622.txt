PUNE: After having cheated 13 people of their money at   kiosks, Mohammed Ansar Mohammed Akram Ansari’s luck ran out on Tuesday.

 Ansari,29, would push a small piece of a   or   beneath the zero button of the ATM machines’ keypads in Deccan and Shivajinagar which slowed them down. 
 
 Senior inspector Radhika Phadke of the cyber crime branch told TOI that the tampered machine does not accept PIN numbers which people punched in. 
 
 Ansari would step into the kiosk ostensibly to ‘help’. Once the victim left the kiosk thinking that something was wrong with the machine, he would pull out the matchstick or the paper and withdraw the cash, Phadke said.
 
 So far, the police and two banks have identified 13 of his victims and are tallying the money he withdrew. He may have taken out cash between Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 each time. A team headed by Phadke and assistant inspector Sagar Panmand, and others arrested Ansari. 
 
 “Ansari moved to Pune three months ago and was living with his married sister in Chinchwad. He was jobless. He found this trick to make money,” Phadke said.
 
 Ansari walked into a trap on Tuesday night. Police recovered Rs 10,000 in cash from him which he had allegedly withdrawn from an ATM kiosk. Phadke said he only targeted ATM kiosks of banks which have square and large keys jutting out of the  . 
 
 He would loiter about outside the kiosk waiting for his victims. “ Ansari would step in and advise them to punch the PIN repeatedly and grasp their numbers. When they left without waiting for the transaction to reach its logical end, he would quickly withdraw the money after pulling out the matchstick or the paper,” she said.
