NAGPUR: Though clan politics was majorly at play during this civic polls, the ‘kith and kin’ factor served to the advantage of city’s controversial Gwalbanshi family for the second time. All three family members who were in fray from different parties won.

 Uncle Jagdish Gwalbanshi, who was also the sitting corporator and contesting from BJP, won from Ward no 12 having polled 9632 votes. His nephew Harish, who was contesting from   from the same ward, won with 14,005 votes. His other nephew Nitish, also contesting from Congress, won in Ward no 10 with 9084 votes.
 
 While Jagdish beat Congress candidate Deepak Wankhede by 1,666 votes, Harish won by a margin of 2.964 votes against BJP’s Sadhna Barde. Nitish, on the other hand, was neck-and-neck with BJP’s Ramesh Chopde, who was leading till Round 4. However, things took a dramatic turn in the last round and much to everyone’s surprise, Nitish defeated Chopde by 68 votes.
 
 In 2007, too, three members of the Gwalbanshi clan— Harish, Nitish and Jagdish’s wife Aruna-- had won in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) elections. Harish, who was earlier in NCP, had switched to Congress around two years back. “Contesting from mainstream parties is also a big advantage. But three of us won mainly because of our strong public connect. People like the ‘joint family’ concept,” said Harish.
 
 Last time, Harish was contesting against Jagdish and the latter won. “This time, we were not contesting against each other. He was standing from Seat 12C while I from 12D. Thus, people could vote for both of us,” said Jagdish. He added the entire family had remained close to public. 
 
 In his affidavit, Harish had declared many criminal offences against him including playing obscene acts and songs in a public and criminal intimidation. Jagdish too has various offences against him like criminal breach of trust and cheating and dishonesty inducing delivery of property. Nitish has an offence for fraudulently using a document.
