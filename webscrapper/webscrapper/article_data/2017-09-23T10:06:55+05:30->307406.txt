NAGPUR: City police may ensure   of Ayush Pugaliya’s alleged assailant and life imprisonment convict Suraj   to extract the truth behind the crime within the premises of the Nagpur central jail’s barrack number five’s bathroom on September 11. Meanwhile, home department has extended it’s permission to police for retaining Kotnake in their custody till September 25. 

 Kotnake had smashed Pugaliya’s head before slitting his throat in the bathroom following a tiff between them. Pugaliya too was serving a triple life imprisonment for kidnapping and murdering eight-year-old Kush Katariya in 2011. Supreme court had upheld the triple life conviction of the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court last year. 
 
 The home department had earlier permitted Dhantoli police to retain Kotnake for seven days ending on September 22. Following the permission, Kotnake was taken into custody by Dhantoli police on September 15. He was produced before the court on the following day. The court had granted police custody of Kotnake till September 25 to Dhantoli police. As the government’s permission was ending earlier than the court’s remand, Dhantoli police had to seek for an extension which was granted on Friday. 
 
 Sources from police station said that Kotnake is likely to have been contemplating the murder as he has now admitted sharpening the broken parts of a container rim for last few days before actually slitting Pugaliya’s throat with it. There had been several unanswered questions before police which they want to now clarify through a scientific procedure as a support to the ongoing probe.
 
 Jail authorities have now stated that Kotnake would continue to remain in a separate cell in the jail once he returns after completion of the remand custody. A separate internal inquiry is now underway by the jail officials to ensure that they also come to know about the loopholes and lacuna from their side.
