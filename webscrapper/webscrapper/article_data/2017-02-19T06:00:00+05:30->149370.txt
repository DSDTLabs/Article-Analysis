From the first look of  , it looks like   is playing a “Vijayawada panthulu” who is into the catering business. The logo on the scooter filled with vegetables that the stylish star is riding indicates as much. ‘Annapurna Caterings,Satyanarayanapuram Agraharam, Vijayawada’, it reads. Director   though is unwilling to reveal the details of the character yet. “We will be releasing the teaser of the film soon, and that will answer your questions,” he said, adding, “All I can say is that   has never done a role like this ever.”
As far as the styling of the character goes, it sure looks like a first for Allu Arjun. “He is playing a very realistic, sweet, innocent young man who is on a larger than life mission. So the styling too is very earthy and real,” explains stylist  .
 Talking about the thought process that went into designing the look, she says, “Allu Arjun plays a passionate young Brahmin boy who is clear about his goal in life. Which is why we gave the traditional Brahmin dhoti a twist. Usually, the traditional dhotis have a golden border. But we designed the dhoti with a silver border instead, alluding to the silver lining that reflects the undying optimistic that this character is. And the saffron kanduva is reflective of his iron will. The focus was to keep the styling minimalistic. So Allu Arjun will be seen in simple, well-cut shirts, leather sandals and accessories like rings and rudraksh.”
