MUMBAI: Three people were killed and at least 10 people suffered burn injuries after a series of explosions took place in boilers at four pharmaceutical factories in   late on Thursday night.

  
  
 
 The three deceased have been identified as Pintu Kumar Gautam, Janu Adaria and Alok Nath. 
 
  
  
 
 Efforts to contain the fire that spread over one acre are still underway.
  
  
 
 Preliminary reports suggest that the explosion took place at Novaphene Speciality Ltd, E-107, in Boisar MIDC industrial area.
 
 
 
 Palghar district superintendent of police Manjunath Singe said that three of the labourers have sustained serious burn injuries. He said that efforts were on to contain the fire. The entire area was put on high alert. 
  
 
 It is suspected that highly combustible chemical stocked in the factory led to the explosion that spread to three neighbouring units. The area has been cordoned off. The blasts led to tremors that were felt up to 12km from the periphery of the factories. 
  
 
 District officials said that efforts were underway to bring the flames under control.
