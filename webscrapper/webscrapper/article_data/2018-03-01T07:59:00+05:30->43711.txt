Chandigarh: A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) judge in Panchkula on Wednesday handed over the chargesheet to Dr Pankaj Garg, surgeon of Shah Satnam Ji Hospital in Sirsa, who allegedly performed castration surgeries on Dera Sacha Sauda followers. 
 
 The judge handed over the chargesheet to Dr Garg while dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and Dr Mahinder Pal Singh, alias Dr Mahinder Insan, were given chargesheets in jail during their appearance in the case through video conferencing. The CBI judge, Kapil Rathi, also fixed March 14 as the next date of hearing for consideration of charges and scrutiny of the chargesheet by the staff and the accused. 
  
 According to information, the proceedings began with the handing over of the chargesheet in the court when Dr Garg appeared. Since he had already been given interim bail by the Punjab and Haryana high court, he was asked to furnish a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh and two sureties of the like amount by the CBI judge to be released on bail. Dr Garg’s counsel said soon after furnishing the bail bonds, the court fixed the next date in the matter. 
  
 On February 3, the CBI had submitted its chargesheet against jailed dera head, Dr Garg and Dr Singh while charging them with voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means, criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation and cheating. 
  
 Gurmeet is currently lodged in Rohtak’s Sunaria jail after his conviction in a rape case while Dr Singh is lodged in Ambala jail. On December 23, 2014, the Punjab and Haryana high court had ordered a CBI probe into charges of forced castration of followers inside the dera in Sirsa after hearing a petition by Hans Raj Chauhan. The latter had claimed that he and 400 other followers were allegedly castrated with the false hope that the emasculation would lead to realisation of God through Gurmeet.
