BENGALURU: “If you construct   under a high tension wire, we'll not sanction power supply .“ This is what the   ( ) told the BBMP recently.

 In a hurry to set up   in all the 198 wards across Bengaluru, the BBMP had chosen a vacant government land in Sarakki that comes under a high tension wire. On July 9, TOI had reported the BBMP's plans to build the canteen under a 66 KV high tension wire and next to a power transmission tower at 14th Cross, 1st Stage, JP Nagar in Sarakki. The Palike had gone ahead with levelling the ground, cutting branches of trees at the site without necessary safety clearances from the KPTCL. Acting on the TOI report, the officials inspected the spot on July 11. On the same day, KPTCL issued a notice to BBMP saying the proposed construction will be a violation of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) Regulations, 2010. "As per Section 61 of CEA Regulations Act 2010, it is illegal to build anything under or adjacent to the transmission lines. In an 18-metre corridor below the line, no construction can be taken up. Such constructions will not get power connections too," the notice reads.
 
 BBMP officers confirmed receiving the notice. However, the ward engineer said the Palike will still take up the work by making required modification in the plan.
 
 "The earlier plan was to construct the canteen in 40ft X 40ft square area. Now, we are consulting the KPTCL officers to see if we can construct the same in a 30ftX 50 ft square area, a little away from the land. We are trying to set up the canteen before August 15 and there's no other suitable place in the ward," BBMP officials said.
