 "It meant a lot to me because it was my album. Last time, it was for his project, which was an honor too, but I'm just happy that he got to be a part of it. It means so much to me and to our city, I feel like it's going to be big. 
 
 "Just the things he's talking about on there and brought to the table were things that definitely needed to be said. I was glad that he could bring that perspective to it. The true meaning of a feature is to add something that's not already there to a song and he more than did that," Sean said.
