We spotted   enjoying some mixed martial arts action at   in the capital last week. "The organizers insisted that I come because they felt that I would enjoy watching the sport. Fitness is my religion, so I thought let’s see what the hype is all about. I’ve always been a sports and fitness buff, and I don’t miss an opportunity to catch some sporting action," Vadra told us.

 Cheering for the   franchise at the league, Vadra spoke about his connection with the state. He said, "I’m here supporting the UP team – my home team. I am happy that most professional sports leagues have teams from the state today." When asked if he would consider owning a UP-based franchise in a league, given his interest in sports, Vadra replied, "I’ve been asked to invest in some teams time and again. But for me, sports is like a religion, a passion. I don’t want to commercialise that, but let’s see what the future holds. Maybe someday I might, when I feel the time is right."
 
 With   in the thick of the polls, was Vadra missing that ringside view? He replied, "Not really.   is in our blood. But for me, sports is just as important. It has not only given me physical, but also mental strength. It helps me gain some peace of mind. In fact, it has helped me cope and stay level when governments have come after me."
