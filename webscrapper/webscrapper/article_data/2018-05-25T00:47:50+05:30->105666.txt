Renowned actor   is currently in the news, not for his extraordinary performances in films rather for being accused of inappropriate behavior by several women who have worked with him and a   from a leading international publication.

 Morgan Freeman recently issued an apology which read, “Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy. I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected — that was never my intent.”
 
 As reported by a channel, after conversing with 16 women – each of whom had worked with Freeman over the span of his career, they had significant evidence against the actor. Reportedly, eight female actors alleged that the ‘Shawshank Redemption’ actor inappropriately touched them and commented on their bodies.
 
 The channel even claimed that one of the women reportedly averred that Freeman ‘kept trying to lift up my skirt and asking if I was wearing underwear’.
 
 Moreover, as reported, approximately four people who have been a part of the production capacities for the movies that Freeman worked also described him as someone who repeatedly behaved in ways that made women uncomfortable.
 
 Reportedly, a woman who worked as a senior member of the production staff of the movie ‘Now You See Me’ revealed that Morgan sexually harassed her and her female assistant. She reportedly averred that he did comment on their bodies. And she also added that whenever they were aware that Freeman would be around they wouldn’t wear tops that would show their breasts or the ones that fitted really well.
 
 The writer of Madam Secretary told an international channel about a party in which they saw inappropriate behavior by Freeman. The writer reportedly professed that they saw him go around to the girls in the circle and get really close to their faces, he didn't do it to the men; and also added that there absolutely were sexual undertones to his actions.
