A group  ,  , that opened recently, saw artists and art connoisseurs hobnobbing with each other. featuring the works of 16 upcoming artists from Banaras, the artworks on display took the visitors back to the haunting alleys of Banaras, and got them talking about the ‘eternal city’ passionately. And, staying to true to the spirit of encouraging young artists, the guests were seen making an effort to soak in the art, interact with the artists and understand their works. A perfect way to spend an evening!
