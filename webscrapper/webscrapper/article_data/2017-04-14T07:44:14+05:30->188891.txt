HYDERABAD: Employees of erstwhile   (SBH) and other four associate banks merged with   (SBI) on April 1, heaved a sigh of relief on Thursday, following the breather given to them by   till June 15.

 Clarifying that the relief would be applicable to employees of all five associate banks, Harshvardhan Madabhushi, general secretary,   (ABOA), which filed the petition in the HC, said: “You need to tell employees being absorbed (in SBI) what is in store for them. When there is no clarity on the issue, how can employees decide whether they want to join or not. The court has seen contradictions and given relief.“
 
 He said they had no option, but to knock on doors of the court as attempts to raise concerns with SBI management, finance minister   and RBI governor came to naught. Saying that associate bank employees had been feeling cheated, he accused SBI of trying to create two sets of officers within the same bank with different service conditions. “If nearly 30,000 officers, which is almost half the total number of officers in SBI, are given such a raw deal what kind of devastating effects the accumulated frustration of so many people will have on the organization?
 This is something no one seems to have thought of,“ he said.
 
 “A merger is not just about buildings and tables and chairs. You have to take people along with you. After all, these banks existed for 75-100 long glorious years and have been doing exceedingly well. Now, the government is trying to portray our advantage of creating a niche in operations as a geographical concentration risk,“ he said.
 
 Calling terms of the merger an injustice to employees of associate banks, AP & Telangana Bank Employees Federation general secretary BS Rambabu said: “SBI management wanted only the assets and business created by SBH employees and not the employees.“
