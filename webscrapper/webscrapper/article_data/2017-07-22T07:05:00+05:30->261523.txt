Patiala: The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), during the three-day special drive against non-compliance of bio-medical waste by the health facilities, has found 33 hospitals in the state violating the pollution norms. Board officials said action had been initiated against these erring hospitals.

 PPCB chairperson K S Pannu said the board would follow a zero-tolerance policy with regard to bio-medical waste as it had the potential to spread deadly diseases. He appealed the medical professionals to follow the stipulated procedure for disposal of bio-medical waste.
 
 “The engineers of the PPCB have been directed to keep a constant watch on hospitals for ensuring proper disposal of bio-medical waste,” Pannu said. He said PPCB had constituted teams headed by its environment engineers to inspect the hospitals.
 
 Pannu said bio-medical waste was a major environmental irritant that required special handling and management. He said, “The PPCB has already given detailed guidelines to the hospitals for handling and management of bio-medical waste, which is collected by specialized agencies authorized by the Board. About 14 tonnes of bio-medical waste is collected daily by specialized agencies with vehicles having been fitted with centrally controlled GPS systems.”
 
 There are about 10,000 hospitals in Punjab, including the government-run health institutions.
