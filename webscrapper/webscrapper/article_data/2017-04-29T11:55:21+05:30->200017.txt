KANPUR: The ambitious   project launched by former chief minsiter   in Kannauj, which also happens to be his wife Dimple Yadav's parliamentary constituency, has hit a roadblock a year after its inauguration, over an alleged lack of funds. 

  Inaugurated on April 27, the project was launched to cash in on the famous 'attar' industry of Kannauj and give the   a global platform to sell their products. 
 
 Currently, construction has been halted and a dug up basement can be seen on the site.
 
 Sources in  , the authority which was supervising the project, said the work had come to a grinding halt over lack of finances. A source said, "While the former chief minister wanted to bring the 'attar' town -Kannauj-on world map, his successor Yogi Aditya Nath doesn't seem too interested." Apart from the perfume park, a perfume museum was also proposed in the district. 
 
 Assistant engineer, Prabhat Gupta, who was a part of the team supervising the project, said, "The project was assigned to Rajkiya Nirman Nigam. The agency stopped construction over non-payment of dues."
 
 An official, working closely on the project, said on condition of anonymity, "The SP government suffered a humiliating defeat at a time when the authorities were drawing plans to raise funds for the project. The files have been sent to the state government, but the project is in limbo."
