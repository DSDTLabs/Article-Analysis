Kolkata: A gang of extortionists repeatedly attacked the employees of a construction firm, involved in some civil work inside the Peerless Hospital, over the weekend for refusing to pay Rs 6,000 as Durga Puja  . Besides assaulting the employees, the gang members — all residents of Shahid Smriti Colony of Panchasayer and led by a woman druglord — even allegedly outraged the modesty of one of the senior female staffers.

 Police have so far arrested three persons, including gang leader Khuku Byapari, who runs a hooch business. Her aide Kasiram Haldar has also been picked up. Both of them have several other cases registered against them. 
 
 “The Shahid Smriti Colony Sadharan Durgotsav Committee that organizes a puja in the Panchasayer area had planned to go big this year. They had asked Byapari to arrange for funds. Last Friday, they went to the employees of Alliance Construction, who are presently camping inside the Peerless Hospital, and demanded Rs 3,000. After being denied, the accused scaled up their demands on Sunday and asked the firm to pay up Rs 6,000,” said an investigating officer.
 
 A case was started on the basis of a written complaint filed by Ranjit Kundu (site-in-charge of Alliance Construction). The accused have been slapped sections pertaining to extortion and threat. Cops have stepped up the hunt for others.
 
 According to police sources, the incidents of subscription excesses are linked with certain individuals who are trying to “control” the lesser known pujas to try and extend their control in the area. “This is a result of power struggle between rivals trying to control local proceedings by organizing Durga and Kali pujas that are now avenues to pocket sponsorships and bag new deals. Any challenge to their authority is not acceptable,” explained an officer from the anti-rowdy section of the detective department.
