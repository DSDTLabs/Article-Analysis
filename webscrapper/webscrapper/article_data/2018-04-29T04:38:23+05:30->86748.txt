GURUGRAM:  , a nine-year-old city girl, bagged gold in the Under-10 category of National Figure Skating Open Championship in Gurugram on Saturday.

 Around 100 participants from across the country are taking part under various categories in the two-day championship organised by   at iSKATE in Ambience Mall.
 
 A Class V student of  , Sector 43,   was just seven when she first came to iSKATE. Two years on, she clinched a national gold, and is now aiming for Olympics glory. 
 
 Currently, the main challenge this little gifted young   faces is to find a full-time coach who can guide her through the course and help her achieve her dreams. 
 
 Till she finds one, Lavanya added, she is trying her best to improve her skills on her own and stay fit for upcoming competitions. “Many figure skaters like to do spins, jumps, lifts and spirals. I am practising double and triple axel for upcoming competitions,” she said while talking about her skating techniques.
 
 “I want to be the best figure skater in the country. For someone from India, where ice skating is still in the nascent stage with only a handful of indoor rinks, beating the best in the world is really going to be a daunting task. I practise around two hours regularly,” said Lavanya.
 
 Lavanya’s former Russian coach Liubov ‘Libi’ Timeeva, who taught her the basics of the sport, believed Lavanya was nearly as talented as any Russian girl of her age.
 
 “She’s promising, and can represent India. If she gets proper training, not only is she capable of performing well for India, she can win medals too,” Timeeva had told TOI earlier.
