 A group led by   from YHC Studio organized a flash mob in which mothers, dressed in saris, participated with their kids. “I had never thought that I will ever participate in a flash mob wearing a sari! Though I was a bit worried about dancing in a sari, it all went well. The best part was that our kids also danced with us. I think this is the best start to Mother’s Day,” says Anita Yadav, Sector 56 resident. Rashmi Grover Das, also a resident of Sector 56, added, “I come here regularly, but attending the event in a sari and participating in a flash mob was completely different. I am glad that I could enjoy this with my kid.”
 
  
  
 
 
 
 The morning also had zumba sessions, along with activities like badminton, volleyball and cycling. But bodybuilders and fitness enthusiasts found out another way to have fun. Some were seen attempting to pick up truck tyres. “You do not get to do all of this anywhere else. I stay near Jalvayu Towers, so coming here is like a routine now,” said Rashika Sen, a resident of Sector 56.
