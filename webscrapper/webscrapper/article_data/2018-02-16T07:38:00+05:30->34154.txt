CHANDIGARH: A three-member committee was formed on Thursday to set out a marketing strategy that will benefit   and potato farmers of Punjab. As per chief minister Amarinder Singh’s directions, the committee will include additional chief secretary (cooperation), additional chief secretary (development) and chairman of the   (PSFC). The committee has been directed to submit its report by March 1.

 The committee would suggest ways and means to provide marketing support for maize and potato crops to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices without wastage of these commodities.
 
 The chief minister directed the committee to identify domestic and international markets for sale and supply of farmers’ produce at attractive prices as they have to suffer losses due to lack of proper marketing facilities for these crops. It has also been directed that the committee should also explore the possibility of future trading in these farm produce to facilitate farmers in ensuring remunerative pricing with risk hedging.
 
 The chief minister also reiterated that farmers should be encouraged to opt for crop diversification in a big way in line with the state government’s thrust on diversified cultivation as a means of rescuing them from their debt cycles. He has also sought committee’s suggestions to spread awareness among potato growers about various varieties to help them cultivate the varieties that are in demand by large multi-national companies (MNCs) such as McDonald’s and McCain Foods.
 
 The chief minister also asked the committee to assess the possibility production of ethanol from maize as suggested by the Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari.
