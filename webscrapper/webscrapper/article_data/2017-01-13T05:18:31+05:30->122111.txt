NEW DELHI: India roundly condemned the 
  and   two days ago, with an official statement pointing a finger at Pakistan without naming it.

 The ministry of external affairs statement emphasised the “inhumane suffering inflicted on the peace-loving people of the region by the abominable phenomenon of international terrorism, which sadly continues to have its epicentre in our region and is pursued brazenly as an instrument of state policy to achieve narrow political objectives.”
 
 Prime Minister   also wrote a letter to   condemning the terrorist strike, particularly the explosions that targeted   officials in Kandahar that left both the UAE ambassador to Afghanistan and the governor of the province injured. “India condemns these attacks on Afghanistan, and on its legitimate authority. Such attacks are unacceptable and are aimed at undermining the progress made by the people of Afghanistan against all odds,” he said.
 
 Separately, the French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said there should be “decisive action” against Pakistan-based terror groups like LeT, JeM and Hizbul Mujahideen which are “targeting” India and promised to work with New Delhi to get terrorist Masood Azhar proscribed by the UN security council.
 
 The Indian response on the Afghanistan terror attacks was aimed at Pakistan --the biggest supporter of the Afghan   — as well as against countries like Iran and Russia which have, by their outreach to the Taliban, granted them legitimacy and undermined the government in Kabul.
