HYDERABAD: National Green Tribunal's south zone bench at Chennai on Friday issued orders to the   for inspection of all stone crusher units in GO 111 area and other parts of Telangana.   directed TSPCB to implement the 2016 order of closure of illegal stone crusher units and to penalise these units under `Polluter pays' principle.

 NGT issued the orders while dealing with a miscellaneous application filed by city-based `Human Rights and Consumer Protection Cell' Trust led by activist Thakur Raj Kumar Singh.
 
 The petitioner has produced photographic evidence of illegal stone crusher units operating in Vattinagulapally that falls in GO 111 area and other areas on the side of Outer Ring Road falling in 10km radius downstream Himayatsagar and Osmansagar. Several localities in the city such as Financial District, Nanakramguda and Serilingampally are affected by these illegal units.
 
 Telangana standing counsel in NGT, Yasmeen Ali, said, “In 2016, NGT took up a case suo motu and asked for a report from PCB. After   submitted the report, NGT observed that out of 667 stone crushing units in Telangana, 275 units against which closure orders were issued have been running in an unauthorised manner.“
 
 Thakur Singh, who filed a main case against illegal constructions in GO 111 areas, filed a fresh miscellaneous petition on alleged non-implementation of orders against crusher units.
 
 TSPCB Ranga Reddy regional officer, M Venkanna, said, “We are verifying the photos produced by the petitioner. If we find any stone crusher units operating without consent, we will close them. After 2016, we issued notices and got many units closed. Some of them were regularized after due process.“
