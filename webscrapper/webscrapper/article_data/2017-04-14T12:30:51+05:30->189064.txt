GURUGRAM: Acute   shortage gripped Sushant Lok-1 on Wednesday and Thursday as   (DHBVN) snapped electricity supply to most boosting stations and borewells in the colony owing to non-payment of power bills.

 Sources said the maintenance agency had not paid the discom pending electricity bill of Rs 63 lakh as yet, because of which the power supply to boosting pumps and borewells was disconnected. 
 
 While some residents received water only for 10 minutes on Thursday morning, many had not been receiving water for more than 24 hours. “Boosting pumps help increase water pressure to supply it to different areas, but power supply to such stations has been disconnected. This triggered the crisis in the area. I got water for a few minutes. I couldn’t fill even two buckets,” said Sadhana Srivastava, a resident of Sushant Lok I.
 
  A group of residents blamed maintenance fee defaulters for the water crisis. Sudhir Sachdeva, a resident of Block C in Sushant Lok-I, said, “Power supply to boosting stations has been cut yet again due to non-payment of  . There are many defaulters, who do not pay maintenance bills, in the colony. As a result, the residents who are paying the bills are also suffering. ”
 
  General manager (facilities) of maintenance agency Profac said around 60 per cent of residents in Sushant Lok-1 had not paid maintenance charges for months, and over Rs 5 crore had been pending since 2015. “ How are we supposed to function without funds?” he told TOI.
 
 “Despite sending repeated reminders, bills were not paid by the agency. It has been the case for around past nine months. We had to disconnect the power supply,” said DHBVN official.”
