BELAGAVI: Water resources minister M B Patil said on Monday that the Karnataka government will expose the big drama the Goa government has been enacting on the Mahadayi dispute, before the Mahadayi River Water Disputes Tribunal, which is scheduled to begin hearings on February 6. 

  Calling   national president  , his Karnataka counterpart   and Goa chief minister   the stage managers of the drama, Patil said work had stopped in August 2017, following an undertaking given by the state government before the tribunal. He spoke after inspecting the Mahadayi river basin. 
 
  He wanted Goa's water resources minister Vinod   to apologize for violating protocol and visiting the Kalasa-Banduri project site without intimation, and for using an expletive to abuse the people of Karnataka. 
 
  "If Yeddyurappa had not made a fuss, Palyekar would not have come here. We will present our case before the tribunal and get our share of water. Palyekar visited the spot in order to create a controversy. The projects that one sees there are old ones. He inspected old projects. No new projects have been taken up since August. We are prepared for a third party inspection any time," Patil said. 
 
 According to Patil, the present status of the project was a 5.1km channel dug in a non-forest area, and the dam which is in a forest area, has not been constructed on the Kalasa river. Work on the   canal never started as it is also in the forest area, he added.
