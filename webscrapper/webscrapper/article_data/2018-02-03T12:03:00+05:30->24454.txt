CHENNAI: The sunset date for claiming a tax holiday/exemption by eligible   has been extended. At present, eligible startups could claim deduction for three out of seven years, if incorporated between April 1, 2016 and April 1, 2019. This has been extended by two more years to April 1, 2021.

 Further, the requirement of a total turnover of up to Rs 25 crore for the eligible business, will now apply for seven years, beginning from their year of incorporation. “While it is in line with the Startup India plan, it is an additional condition for startups. Earlier, the turnover restriction ended as of March 2021. Now, startups cannot exceed the turnover limit for seven years, from when they are incorporated,” said Ajay Rotti, partner, Dhruva Advisors.
 
 The definition of eligible startup has also been brought in lines with the action plan to bring in the aspect of employment or wealth creation. Balaji Viswanathan, founder of Invento, a robotics startup, said while the Budget was a prudent one overall, there wasn’t much for startups. 
 
 “Doubling funding for Digital India and having 5 lakh hotspots is a welcome move but more should be done. There is a need to involve startups in reforming the agriculture sector. The Mudhra scheme is limited to Rs 10 lakh in funding. Startups need more. We get stuck in between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 2 crore stage,” he said.
 
 Angel Tax, a highly discussed topic went without a mention. K Ganesh, serial entrepreneur and partner, GrowthStory said, “Early stage startups, which are struggling to identify their business model, have been slapped with I-T notices. We were lobbying against this bizarre tax but nothing has happened. On the positive side, statements of intent on hybrid instruments being considered, recognition of role of angel investors and startup ecosystem are welcome steps but we need to see how this is translated in terms of actual policy. But it feels good that role of this sector has been specifically called out.”
