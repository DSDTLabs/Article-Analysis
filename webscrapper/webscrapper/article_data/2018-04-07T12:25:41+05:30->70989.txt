NAGPUR: The VHA play field has become a more of a recreational centre for a few of the participating clubs like Golden   Club (GHC).

 
 A day after GHC played without a goalkeeper and suffered a 3-0 loss, their players were seen celebrating after conceding goals during their 1-12 defeat to   in the VHA-MOIL Senior Division League on Friday. What was upsetting was the attitude of Golden Hockey Club skipper   and defender  .
 
 There was less of sportsmanship and more of ‘letting the juniors have a field day’ attitude as the duo kept on applauding the skills of one of their opponent, Varun Yadav, who looked in his early teens. It looked if they were playing a practice match.
 
 Nawghare, who was playing right back, even urged a TOI photojournalist asking him to click picture of his opponent. “Bhaiyya, ye ladke ka foto lo. Ye ladke ne achha goal kiya hai,” he said, while pointing a stick at Yadav, who scored the goal for SOS.
 
 If this was not enough to indicate their casual approach on the field, another incident occurred, which affirmed VHA’s ‘please all’ decision to allow 60 teams, few of which have mostly professional footballers, who have never played hockey before. In the half-time, when TOI asked a player which team he was playing for, he had no answer. “Pata nahi konsi team hai. Mei football khelta hu,” he said.
 
 Earlier, majority of Rahul Sankrutyayan Sports Association - a professional football team of the city - players who have hardly played hockey, were fielded under the name of Nagpur Gymkhana.
 
 “A lot of footballers are being fielded in the league under new clubs that are participating for the first time. That’s why they don’t play seriously and this is really sad,” a top VHA official said on a condition of anonymity.
