AHMEDABAD: Shobaram Pandey, 75, was run over by a   bus (route number 61) at   Crossroads corridor on Saturday noon. Sources said that the victim was taken to LG hospital but was declared dead after 15 minutes of treatment.

 Police sources said that the bus driver had fled from the spot of the accident fearing mob fury but later surrendered at   police station.
 
 Harshad Patel, a local social worker, said that Pandey used to work at a factory in Vatva but had been rendered jobless after the factory closed down. “He survived on his savings and on the money he got from the company at the time of closure,” said Patel.
