Music, they say, is universal, but when it comes to   trying to prove their mettle in the   industry, it is definitely not a cake walk. For years, women have tried to break the glass 
ceiling to reach a point where they are known for their talent and not for their gender. Bangalore Times spoke to four women musicians and performing artistes, who talk about their journey and why they choose to tread the offbeat path.
 
 
 
 The award-winning singer gave playback singing a new meaning when she introduced a jazzy twist to Akkamahadevi’s  .
 
  It all began three years back when I met Ramakrishna S during a recording. Since he was working on this and different genres, it was just a pure collaboration with him on these vachanas. I am familiar with vachanas and was always fascinated by them. Though they were written in the 12th century and are more devotional in nature, I thought why not try something different.
 
  I relate to these vachanas because Akka, at that point, fought with the society. There are so many women who are doing the same thing. In our society, women are judged on various aspects and now it just feels good to be able to perform these vachanas in a different way and that encourages me. I’m just trying to prove myself and try not to bother about what others think.
 
  Whether it is the music industry or any other field, women must be themselves. Stick to your roots and never try to be someone else. Your talent is your biggest strength and you just need to show that to others.
