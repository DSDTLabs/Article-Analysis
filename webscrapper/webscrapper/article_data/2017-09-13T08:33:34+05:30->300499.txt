BENGALURU: Officers of the Special Investigation Team probing the murder of   have questioned about 80 people from different parts of the city and other districts, including Maoist-affected areas, police sources said.
The questioning sessions are being conducted inconspicuously at select police stations. At least half a dozen people, including a man close to a political leader's aide, were questioned on Tuesday .
 
 In the absence of concrete leads from the crime scene, a few SIT officers are focusing on conventional methods of investigation.
 
 "Those being questioned include persons with criminal antecedents, murder accused out on bail, anti-social elements, realtors with mafia connection among others," the sources said.
 
 Footages from two CCTV cameras installed at Gauri's house showed the assailant opening fire on her. Investigators suspect the shooter could be 25-35 years old and 5 feet 3 inch to 5 feet 6 inch tall.
 
 Investigating officers said they strongly suspect the assailant may have changed his attire after killing Gauri. "Footages from CCTV cameras in the neighbourhood show no man wearing the same attire leaving the area within 20 minutes of the killing.We have scanned footage from scores of CCTV cameras, and this indicates the assailant might have changed his outfit," the sources said.
 
 "Teams working on the Maoist angle are in Sringeri, Chikkamagalur, Hebri and other places. We haven't got any vital clue so far," they added.
 
 "Police teams from   which had worked on MM Kalburgi murder case will be helping us now. A team of 10 experts from North Karnataka, particularly from  , will meet us in a day or two," the sources added.
