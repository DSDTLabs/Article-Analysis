PURULIA: A three-year-old girl from Purulia was admitted to Kolkata’s   on Saturday after a brutal sexual assault left her arms fractured and seven needles inserted in her stomach, ribs and private parts.

 Police have launched a hunt at Nadiara in Purulia for the accused, retired homeguard Sanatan Thakur.
 
 On July 11, the child was admitted to   in Purulia with fever and cold. On noticing scratch marks on her body, doctors enquired with her mother, who skirted their queries. The hospital then formed a five-member team to supervise her treatment and informed the district Childline. After an X-ray revealed the seven needles, Childline representatives interrogated the mother, who said Thakur (62) had assaulted her daughter.
 
 The child was shifted to   on Friday evening and SSKM’s paediatric intensive care unit the next day. “We will take a call on her treatment once we get the test reports,” said a hospital official.
 
 Police went to Thakur’s house at Nadiara but found it locked. It then emerged that the mother, who has been deserted by her husband, had worked for Thakur for the past year. “We have no idea about the assault or the child. My father-in-law practised black magic and village women often came to him. Since he lived separately, we have no idea about his day-to-day activities,” said his daughter-in-law.
