Chennai:The long weekend due to pooja holidays attracted more crowds in both Children’s Park in Guindy and  .

 While more than 7,100 visitors came to Children’s Park on Saturday, the zoo attracted 17,400 visitors. A senior wildlife official said generally on a holiday about 5,000 visitors would come to the zoo. On weekdays it wouldn’t cross 2,000. But, this long weekend, the zoo saw thrice the usual number of visitors. On Friday, there were 8,300 visitors at the zoo. The officer said many were busy making arrangements for pooja in the evening and hence the zoo didn’t see many visitors. Similarly, Children’s Park saw not more than 3,500 visitors on Friday.
 
 Work related to crowd management at the zoo was entrusted to one range officer. However, five other range officers helped him when he was unable to handle the situation. At Children’s Park, there was not much intervention from officials, as the crowd entered and exited the premises without any difficulty.
 
 One of the visitors R Rajasekar said Children’s Park is an affordable tourist spot. Accessibility to this park is one of the main reasons many people drop by. In view of Wildlife Week celebrations beginning on Monday, entry is free at both Children’s Park and the zoo from October 2 to 8, the officials added.
