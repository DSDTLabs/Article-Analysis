NAVI MUMBAI: If all goes according to Cidco’s plan, leaseholders in   area can become actual owners of the properties which are still under 60 years of lease.

    is working on a proposal that will cover only the NMMC jurisdiction area (spanning about 162 sq km from Airoli to CBD-Belapur) to convert all acquired land into freehold from existing leasehold status (see box). 
 
 A comprehensive plan will be ready in the next three months and tabled before the state government in August for further approval.
 
 “Once approved and implemented in Navi Mumbai, it will set a precedent for other cities across the state. Navi Mumbai will be the first city in the state to have freehold status on lines of Delhi,” said Belapur MLA Manda Mhatre, who has been advocating the move. 
 
 However, many are skeptical over the calculation of one-time charge. “Cidco should impose a nominal amount as administrative expenses to award the freehold right. Else, it will be a huge financial burden on residents,” said MCHI member, Rajesh Prajapati.
 
 “Our town planning team is formulating a broad-based plan to address all issues related to the conversion process A key factor in this proposal is the quantum of one-time premium to be paid by the stakeholders to claim freehold right. We are trying to calculate an acceptable amount for all concerned, based on different sizes and use of plots,” said Cidco MD, Bhushan Gagrani. 
 
 Hence Cidco will need at least 90 days to complete the  , he added. 
 
 “I have been asked by the CM to present the proposal at the earliest,” added Gagrani.
 
 However, many believe that property prices will soar as, in many cases, builders who had brought plots through auction process will have to pay an additional amount to convert the land into freehold. 
 
  Builders still own a majority of buildings, say observers. Very few housing societies have a conveyance deed with Cidco which can help them to deal directly with Cidco and get freehold status.
