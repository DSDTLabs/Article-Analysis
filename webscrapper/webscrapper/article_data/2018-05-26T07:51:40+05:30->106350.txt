 Employment, or the lack of it, is likely to be one of the biggest issues in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. 
 
 The opposition has repeatedly criticized the Prime Minister for being unable to create enough jobs. It claims Modi's 'achche din' claim will take a beating and the government is in denial over the threat of mass-unemployment.
 
 
 
 
 The Modi government has strongly refuted the charge. It says that despite inheriting from the UPA an economy in deep distress and a terrible employment situation, it has managed to strengthen job prospects significantly. According to the government, a large number of news jobs are being generated through entrepreneurship and in the informal sector through government loans and schemes but these are not being captured in official data.
