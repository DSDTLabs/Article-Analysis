PATNA: The early onset of summer is making Patnaites bear the brunt of heat and   (AC) sellers expect that sales will pick up considerably this year. The   market usually becomes active in mid-March, but inquiries and orders have started pouring in almost a month in advance.

 “People have started calling us up or visiting our store to have a look at the latest models and their prices. We have witnessed an early onslaught of summer this time, right from the beginning of March, which is an opportunity for higher growth in the AC and cooler segment,”  , the owner of a retail store near the planetarium said on Thursday.
 
 Sellers are expecting a 35-40% rise in sales this time. Anuj added, “To avoid midsummer rush, many people are opting for early purchase. Unlike previous years, they are installing AC not only in their bedrooms and drawing rooms, but also in their dining areas.”
