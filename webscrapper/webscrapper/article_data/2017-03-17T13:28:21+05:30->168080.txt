PANAJI:   Churchill Alemao’s decision to support the Manohar Parrikar-led BJP   hasn’t gone down well with the NCP.

 Stating that Alemao had “violated party discipline” by supporting the regime, NCP has threatened disciplinary action against him.
 
 On Thursday, during the critical vote of confidence of the coalition government, Alemao stood in support of it. He said he made the move to ensure the development of his constituency.
 
 “You have violated party discipline by participating in the meeting of the BJP and supporting it in the formation of its government in Goa without seeking the consent of the central leadership, which is against our party’s constitution,” NCP permanent secretary and working committee member, S R Kohli, said.
 
 NCP has issued a showcause notice to Alemao asking him to explain his side within seven days.
 
 “I asked Alemao whether he had given any letter of support to the BJP or if he had taken a call on his stand, but he kept telling me that he had not taken any sides. Just because he is the only MLA elected from the party, he thinks he is an authority,” state NCP president Jose Phillip D’Souza, said.
 
 NCP said that “necessary disciplinary action would be taken” against Alemao as per the anti-defection law and the party’s constitution. The Benaulim MLA and former chief minister could face disqualification from the assembly if NCP moves a petition to the speaker of the 40-member state assembly seeking it.
