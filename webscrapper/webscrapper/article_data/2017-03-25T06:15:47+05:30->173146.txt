PUNE: Perhaps officials from   find it difficult to learn from their mistake. Two days after bungling up the English paper for second-year   distance education students, the institution wrecked the Marathi exam too. 

 Of the 15 students, who appeared for the Marathi paper, only seven could attempt the exam whereas the rest had to exit the examination hall within 20 minutes. On Wednesday, the same students had got an out-of-syllabus   for English. 
 
 A student, who had no choice but to step out of the examination hall, said, “We could answer only about 20% of the questions asked. The rest of the paper seemed out-of-syllabus. When I enquired with other students, they had the same question paper but they seemed to have no problem with it. A few others faced a similar situation as me and we reported it to the supervisor.”
 
 The new syllabus for Marathi was introduced over a decade ago in 2005. As they enquired, the students found out that two versions of the course material based on the pre- and post-2005 syllabus was sent out. However, the question paper was based on the new syllabus.
 
 An official from   confirmed that some students were sent course material based on the old syllabus. “The paper was set based on the new syllabus and hence students, who were sent the   course work had to suffer on Friday. The students have submitted an appeal to find a solution to the confusion without any academic loss on Friday. We will forward the appeal to the vice-chancellor and appropriate decision would be taken,” the official added.
 
 The appeal has been written by Riya Karsode, Priyanka Mahanwar, Swati Joglekar, among others, who are distance education students at the university and received course material related to the old syllabus.
 
 Meanwhile, SNDT University’s controller of examination Subhash Waghmare said, “We are not at fault in issuing the question paper. We will take an appropriate call on the matter.”
