GURUGRAM: A   racket has been unearthed by the  . An   has been filed against two persons for allegedly getting 15 fake firearms licences “renewed” in Gurgaon on the basis of forged documents.

 Police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar told TOI on Saturday that some Gurgaon cops are also under the scanner and a special investigation team (SIT), led by an ACP-level officer, has been set up to further probe the  .
 
 The scam came to the fore recently, following a probe by joint commissioner Sibas Kabiraj in the wake of a complaint by a resident of Gurgaon village to the police chief.
 
 In his investigation, the joint CP has found the two accused got the firearms of 15 people “re-registered” with Gurgaon police, by submitting fake licences bearing addresses of various states such as Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Jharkhand, and forged ‘no-objection certificates’.
 
 According to Kabiraj, the accused connived with staff from the joint CP’s office as well as other departments to execute the crime. This is because no unique identification number (UIN) was generated for any of the arms licences “renewed” by the Gurgaon police, as per the Union home ministry guidelines, he said in his report.
 
 The joint CP has also pointed out that by “re-registering” the fake licences, the Gurgaon police authenticated them. On the basis of his report, an FIR has been registered which names the two main accused — Manish Bhardwaj and Mohanlal.
 
 “We have constituted an SIT and investigation is being done by Anil Kumar, ACP (Sadar). The arms licence staff in joint commissioner’s office has been shifted out. We are investigating and all those involved will be brought to justice,” Khirwar added.
