COIMBATORE:   on Tuesday agreed to close down all its   of   outside Tamil Nadu and file an affidavit regarding the same before the  .

 While hearing a writ petition filed by the Association of Self-financing Arts, Science and Management Colleges of Tamil Nadu first in February this year, Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana J had ordered Bharathiar University to file a counter. Following this, the university’s counsel submitted a list of distance education centres that it operated outside the state.
 
 Counsel said the university had no control over the activities of the franchisees. “Counsel admitted that Bharathiar University can only operate distance education centres within the state. The university allowing franchisees to advertise and admit students without complying with any of the norms is impermissible,” the court noted.
 
 Meanwhile, the court sought a report from the   (UGC) on the action it has taken on the distance education centres operating outside the state jurisdiction in 2016-17.
 
 The court came down on the UGC for not taking action against Bharathiar University. “Though the UGC is the regulatory authority and has got superintendence over the universities, it has not so far taken any step to stop the illegal activities of franchisees using the name of Bharathiar University,” it said.
 
 Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana also condemned the UGC for not taking any step to control the activities of franchisees. “Counsel appearing for Bharathiar University has informed that the franchisees granted for 2017-18 are withdrawn and an affidavit will be filed to that effect with the counter,” the court said.
 
 In the case of 2016-17, the court sought an explanation from the UGC. “The University Grants Commission is directed to file its report or counter along with relevant materials to show the action taken by them at least after filing this writ petition. The UGC undertakes to follow up this issue with respect to the year 2017-18,” the order said.
