NEW DELHI: Seeking custodial interrogation of   Chidamabaram,   told a Delhi court on Thursday that the one-day remand was virtually wasted as the accused in the INX Media case was referred to the cardiac care unit (CCU) by doctors at the   where he was taken for a routine medical check-up. 

 Additional Solicitor General   said he had “something really shocking to tell the court” as CBI wanted Karti in its custody for interrogation. “Something really shocking. 
 
 The court of metropolitan magistrate (granting one-day custody) accepted the proposition that the case needs investigation. The accused was taken to Safdarjung Hospital. 
 
 However, the doctor advised him to be shifted to CCU even though he didn’t have any complaint or symptom of any serious nature. He was kept in the CCU overnight and discharged at 7.57 am,”   said. 
 
 As a result of the hospitalisation, the CBI contended, Karti could not be interrogated properly as he was to be produced before the court at 2.30pm on Thursday.
