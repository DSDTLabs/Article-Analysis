AHMEDABAD: Raga Jog is Pandit Ravi Shankar’s first essay in the 1956 LP record, “Three Ragas”. Even in the climactic passage, the rendition is unhurried.   measures time not by the flow of seconds but by the ticking of impulses. Sixty-two years later, the same scorn for time was displayed by Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt while interpreting Jog at Saptak. Pandit Ravi Shankar was Pandit Bhatt’s guru.

  — the Mohan veena maestro — entered the stage at 12.40am on Friday. For the next 30 minutes, sound technicians struggled to calm the speakers, which hissed and crackled and boomed. At one point, Pandit Bhatt covered his ears in feigned despair. But overall, his demeanour reflected the regal calmness of his mentor’s Jog. “I was angry, but had to be cool,” Pandit Bhatt told TOI. “The audience does not like tantrums of an artist.” When he glided into alaap, time — feeling utterly ignored — left the auditorium to take a break. 
  
  
 Pandit Bhatt was accompanied by his son, Salil Bhatt, the Satvik veena exponent. Salil Bhatt too detached himself from the present. “The pressure is tremendous while playing with  ,” Salil Bhatt said. “I cut myself off from the stage and try to recall everything he has taught me.” In his measured flair lay the proof of his worth as a student of Pandit Bhatt. As for Pandit Bhatt, his music speaks fluently to aficionados as well as to aspiring rasikas. The moon makes the space scientist formulate precise equations about gravity, rocket fuel, and temperatures. A lover looks at the moon and thinks of perfection and fulfilment. Pandit Bhatt has the expertise of a scientist and the imagination of a poet in love.
