PATNA: A day after getting a rap from the  , the   on Wednesday chalked out a schedule for filling the vacancies in the state police within 12 to 15 months. The revised recruitment schedule will be submitted before the apex court on Friday for its approval.
 
  A bench of Chief Justice of India J S Khehar, Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul had on Tuesday rebuked the state government for making the recruitments at a snail’s pace. The state home department had presented a two-year schedule for filling the 174 vacancies of police stenographers.
  
  Principal secretary (home)   said the fresh schedule was prepared at a meeting attended by, among others, Bihar Police Subordinate Services Commission chairman   and   chairman K S Dwivedi.
  
  “All the police recruitments, including those of sub-inspectors, will be completed within 15 months,” Subhani said and added the recruitment process would be initiated in July this year and completed by September next year.
  
  The Bihar police has currently 34,281 vacancies at different levels. The break-up includes 416 inspectors, 4,659 sub-inspectors, 2,780 assistant sub-inspectors, 6,321 havaldars and 15,496 constables.
  
  The case before the apex court pertains to police vacancies in six states, including Bihar. “The recruitment schedules submitted before the court by two other states were similar to that submitted by Bihar, but the court expressed unhappiness over our schedule for the recruitment of 174 stenographers. We have, therefore, reduced our time-frame to 15 months for making recruitments against all the police vacancies in the state,” Subhani said.
