CHANDIGARH: The department of medical microbiology, PGIMER, Chandigarh will be conducting ‘ICMR-PGIMER Workshop on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing’, a three-day workshop, under the aegis of the   ( ).

 The workshop that began on Thursday will train more than 30 participants, faculty, technologists and research workers from AIIMS, New Delhi, JIPMER, Pondicherry, CMC, Vellore, AFMC, Pune, Hinduja Hospital, Mumbai, Medical College, Wardha, Gangaram Hospital, Delhi and Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata. The main objective of the workshop is to make the delegates proficient in the laboratory procedures to detect antimicrobial resistance in bacterial and fungal pathogens. This will generate reliable and nationally representative data on the present extent of drug resistance, monitor its evolution over time and help in formulation of policies and strategies for management and prevention of the same.
 
 The alarming situation of antimicrobial resistance demands laboratory tests to isolate the causative agents of infection and predict the success of different drugs in treating infections in patients suffering from infection, experts shared. Predicting the efficacy of an antibiotic in curing an infection in a patient, by testing the interaction of the micro-organism with the drugs in the laboratory will be technically challenging and involve stringent methodology.
 
 The ICMR had launched National Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network in 2013 by starting six Nodal   all over India, each specializing in a specific group of infections. The department of medical microbiology, PGIMER has two of those six nodal centres and has been functioning as the Nodal Centres for bacterial pathogens and fungal pathogens. This year, ICMR has widened its network by recruiting nine more regional centres to participate in the   on   surveillance.
