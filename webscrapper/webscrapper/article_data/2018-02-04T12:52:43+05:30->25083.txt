JAIPUR: Rajasthan Technical University’s ( ) system of ranking its engineering colleges on a scale of 1000 points has won praise from the   ( ), the body governing all technical institutes in the country.

 AICTE has sought details of the system after which it will direct other technical universities to emulate it.
 
 The first-of-its-kind ranking system based on 29 parameters – from parking space to size of the stairs – has been uploaded on RTU’s website to help students choose colleges.
 
 Dileep Malkhede, advisor, AICTE, said, state-wide ranking by RTU is a progressive step.
 
 “It is very important as it gives the real picture about the status of colleges to the local people. HRD does ranking for premier institutes which may not help the masses but state-wide ranking certainly helps students in selecting the best institute in their state,” said Malkhede.
 
 He added that other state technical universities should also adopt the formula to help students identify the best colleges.
 
 The ranking was done by RTU after procuring information online on parameters like: student-teacher ratio, number of courses, total enrolment of students and teachers, number of smart classes, hostel and mess, insurance, playground, number of students scoring first division marks, number of conferences, seminars and journals published by the university in an academic session.
 
 The information is uploaded on the RTU website.
 
 Officials say that they put in a lot of hard work to come up with the ranking which will be evaluated every year. Thus, institutes lagging behind in the ranking have a chance to improve.
