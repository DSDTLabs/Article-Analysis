NAGPUR: At a time   ( ) is unable to pay dues of seven private firms engaged in running three red and one green bus operators, its transport department is all set to appoint a project management consultant to help it procure electric midi buses. The proposal prepared by the department will be tabled before the transport committee meeting on March 16.

 In view of a grant of Rs9.60 crore from the state government to purchase 30 buses for women-only service, NMC has decided to purchase electric buses instead of diesel buses. As NMC has no expertise in running electric buses, it has decided to appoint DRA as project management consultant. NMC will pay around Rs8 lakh to the firm, sources said.
 
 Some nine other proposals too will be tabled. Another proposal is to invite expression of interest for advertisement rights in buses. Though officials have not finalized the rates for advertisements on buses, they are expecting good revenue from each vehicle.
 
 An agreement will soon be made with private operators to display advertisements on 382 buses, including the 20 green buses, and the company will get a share in revenue through advertisements. As per the proposal, monthly charges will be levied on each bus, and officials estimate a revenue of more than Rs1 lakh every year from each of the buses.
 
 NMC officials are considering entering into an agreement with the private operator to get a share in revenue from advertising, which will help them reduce losses in operating the bus service.
 
 The department has proposed to empower the transport department to erect bus shelters instead of NMCâ€™s traffic department. The department will also submit quarterly income and expenditure statement from October 2017 to December 2017 regarding operation of city buses.
