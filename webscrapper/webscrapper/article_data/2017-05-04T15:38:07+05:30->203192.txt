INDORE: In a move to tackle power theft in the city, superintending engineer of MPPKVVCL Subroto   recently constituted a task force, roping in junior engineers and zonal in-charges to raid several locations across the city.

 The power   has close to 5.75 lakh consumers in the city and even then the company finds itself facing losses every year. The reason is the company finds it hard to deal with frequent thefts across the city.
 
 Meanwhile, to balance losses, power tariffs are to be raised which will further dig holes in the common man’s pockets.
 
 Apart from zonal in-charges and junior engineers, others staffers of the discom will constitute the team too. Each team will conduct raids in areas of two zonal offices. They will coordinate directly with superintending engineer and report instances where power theft is found.
 
 “Starting from Wednesday, the teams will focus on areas like Aerodrome and Kalani Nagar between 12 noon and 8 in the evening,” Rai said.
 
 Some localities have already been identified by the company that are to be raided in days to come. According to sources,   and Sirpur areas top the list of theft incidents that have been reported to the company.
 
 Locations like Khajrana, Rajendra Nagar, Malwa Mill area and Mahalakshmi zones will face the music.
 
 Each team will have 2 senior officials and eight staffers as its task force.
