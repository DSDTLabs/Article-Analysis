In one Matrubhasha meeting Dr Vakil had said, “Gujarati has taken a back seat in schools. The most unfortunate part is our children are not very articulate in English either, as that is not their mother tongue. We are staring at a disturbing future where our youth are simply unable to express or articulate.” 
 
 He had also formed the society for promotion of technical education, and was an active member of the  . “He believed in the power of knowledge and education. Every year he would sponsor education of 30 students and he has been doing this for the past 32 years,” said Dr Vakil’s son Rahul Vakil.
