HYDERABAD: Realising that because of his anti-Congress stand, he would be the odd man out at the swearing-in of JD(S) leader HD   as Karnataka CM on Wednesday, Telangana chief minister   on Tuesday made a quick visit to Bengaluru to separately congratulate Kumaraswamy in advance. 

 Doing some quick thinking to wriggle out of a possibly embarrassing situation,   air-dashed to Bengaluru in a chartered flight to complete formalities of conveying his wishes to Kumaraswamy, who will take over the reins of Karnataka with Congress support. 
 
 Several regional chieftains, who are not inimical to Congress, will be present at the swearing-in as they have been invited by JD(S) leadership. Congress side-stepped and supported JD(S) which got lesser seats than it, to form the government, to keep BJP out, which emerged as the single largest party.
 
 The swearing-in ceremony conveys a much bigger message in the run-up to 2019 elections that shedding political differences and egos, Opposition can form an anti-BJP front.   is also expected to attend Kumaraswamy's swearing-in.
