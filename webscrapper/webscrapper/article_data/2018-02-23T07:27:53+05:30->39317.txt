FATEHGARH SAHIB:   (SAD) president   on Thursday asked farmers not to allow installation of meters on electricity grids, saying it was a precursor to doing away with the free power facility extended to them by former CM  . 

 Addressing a gathering at Amloh in   district, Sukhbir said party workers would help farmers in resisting  . He said the party would also protest against the imposition of any new tax and force the government to withdraw it. 
 
 Accusing the government of failing to fulfil its loan waiver assurance, he said even social welfare schemes had been discontinued after the   came into power. "Beneficiaries have been denied relief under old age pension, atta-dal and shagun schemes for the last one year. We will soon start a mass movement to force the government to restart these welfare schemes, including distribution of fee scholarship to scheduled caste students," he said.
 
 Badal also asked the CM to tell what he had achieved in one year. "Amarinder said he would make Punjab drug free. Which big smuggler has he caught? He said 70 % of our youth were drug addicts. Where are they now?"
