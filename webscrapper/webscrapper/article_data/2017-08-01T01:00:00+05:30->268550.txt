While there has never been a dearth of larger-than-life characters on screen, what’s unique about the not-so-hot Sugandha Joshi and the not-so-cool Mudit Sharma -- the lead pair of ' ' played by   and   -- is that they are extremely relatable. 
The story takes a look at the practical side of romance as Mudit and Sugandha go through an awkward phase between their engagement and marriage.
 The film, produced by   and Krishika Lulla, has been directed by RS Prasanna. The trailer of the movie will be launched today, and the event will witness a stand-up comedy act, based on the film’s story, by Jeeveshu and Punya Arora. 
 Rai says, “We want to have a reason to make a film breaks the notion of making middle class a conservative society. After introducing characters like Tanu, Manu and Datto ('Tanu Weds Manu' and ' '), Zoya and Kundan ('Raanjhanaa') and Happy ('Happy Bhag Jayegi'), it’s time to present this remarkable couple, Sugandha and Mudit, to the audience. Both Ayushmann and Bhumi are talented actors and they share great chemistry on screen.”
 Krishika adds, “With this project, we continue to reinforce our association with Aanandji and also back strong scripts and unique stories, which are a treat for content-hungry audiences.”
 'Shubh Mangal Saavdhan', produced by Eros International and Colour Yellow Productions, releases on September 1.
