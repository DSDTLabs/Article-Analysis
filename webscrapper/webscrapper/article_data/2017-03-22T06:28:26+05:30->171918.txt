AHMEDABAD:  , the 27-year-old model who   on Sunday afternoon at her residence — Sukriti Apartment in Jodhpur — had married a Patel youth of her choice about eight years ago. According to police, she had to end the relationship eight months later as her father Minesh Bhatt was not happy with this alliance. “Though Khushboo had been living with her father and 92-year-old grandmother since then, she was often found in depressed mood,” said a police official. 

 Police have seized her cellphone and laptop and sent them for forensic examinations to get clues on what led to her taking the extreme step. Bhatt had committed suicide by hanging herself from a ceiling fan with her dupatta.
 
 “Khushboo’s father is a diabetic. On Sunday, she had cooked brinjal and bajri rotla for her father. However, her father scolded her that he is a diabetic and that she should serve him less food. Khushboo reacted by saying that his father does not like food cooked by her and scolds her most of the time,” said a police official.
  
 Khushboo then went to her room and hanged herself to death. “We have recorded statements of her father, grandmother and brother Bhaumik Bhatt who flew down to Ahmedabad from Australia on Tuesday for the last rites. 
 
 They said that Khushboo used to work as a model for several companies, including a   provider, but had stopped working for the past two years,” the official added.
 
 Police said her father, who used to work in a chemical factory, has not been working for the past 15 years. “Bhaumik used to send him money every month,” said a police source.
 
 Police officials said that they will also enquire from some of Khushboo’s friends to know about her personal life. “Her mother had died in an accident about 15 years ago when she had fallen down from a staircase,” the official added.
