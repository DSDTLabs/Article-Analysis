LUCKNOW: Unidentified miscreants made off with the batteries of a roadways bus parked at a high security-zone near   in Hazratganj early on Sunday. 

 The incident took place when Janki Prasad, driver of the roadways bus ( ), had parked the bus on the roadside and gone to a public toilet to relieve himself. 
 
 When he returned and switched on the ignition, the bus did not start. Thereafter, he checked the bus bonnet to detect snag and found the batteries missing. When he registered a complaint, a police team was sent to the place for investigation.
 
 Investigation officer, Radheshyam Singh, said the incident was reported at 3.45am on Sunday. "It could be the handiwork of some drug addict(s), who would have stolen the batteries to earn quick bucks," he added. A case has been registered and we will soon nab the miscreants.
