While most films steer clear of box-office clashes, the makers of ' ' have decided to take on the Hollywood bigwig, 'Avengers: Infinity War'. The film is touted to be director Sudhir Mishra’s biggest outing so far — not just in terms of canvas or casting, but also the idea. 

 The movie is a reverse spin on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay’s 'Devdas', set against a political backdrop. Though more of a political thriller, the film has kept the romance of 'Devdas' intact. It also has Shakespearean influences, with the elements of power and politics borrowed from the Bard. Industry stalwarts and insiders, who have already watched the film, have appreciated the story and performances. 
 
 Director   stated, “Layer by layer,   unravels a complex but gripping drama on the reality of Indian democracy, where the least important person is the voter. A heady mixture of families, mining, wealth, violence, love and sex, supported by brilliant performances.” Critics, too, have given a thumbs up to the refreshing storyline and powerful performances. 
 
 Apart from the main trio —   (Dev),   (Paro),   (Chandni aka Chandramukhi) — the film also stars Saurabh Shukla, Vipin Sharma, Dalip Tahil, Deepraj Rana and Anurag Kashyap.
 
 'Daas Dev', presented by Gaurav Sharma, Storm Pictures and produced by Sanjeev Kumar, releases today.
