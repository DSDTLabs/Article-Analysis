GUNTUR:   auctions are set to begin in the state on March 8. The tobacco board has finalised the schedule for the sale season for AP after consulting stakeholders, including farmers and merchants.

 Auctions will start in Kanigiri, Podili and DC palle of Prakasam district on Day One. They will be launched in Tangutur-1, 2, Ongole-1, 2, Vellampalli-1, 2 and Kodepi platforms on March 19, and in West Godavari district on April 11.
 
 Although tobacco board authorised a crop size of 136 million kg for the season, officials are expecting an output of 120 million kg due to adverse weather. With farmers in   getting reasonably good prices in the neighbouring state, growers in AP, too, are hopeful of getting good returns. Farmers are demanding at least Rs140 a kg keeping in view increased input costs.   president  , however, said they will discuss the price band with all merchants and try to offer maximum possible prices to farmers.
 
 Tobacco board secretary Addanki Sridhar Babu asked merchants to be liberal in offering prices to growers as cultivation costs have gone up steeply in the last few years. 
 
 Interestingly, crops in Karnataka fetched farmers average price of Rs140 a kg despite the Karnataka stock being more premium than APâ€™s. While the bright grades of Karnataka were picked up at Rs162 a kg, medium variety was got Rs 147 a kg. The low grades traded at around Rs 115 a kg.
