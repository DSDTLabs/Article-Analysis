AIZAWL/GUWAHATI: The six   members who have been elected to the 20-member   (CADC) are likely to leave the party and form an alliance with BJP in the CADC, sources from   said on Thursday. 

 The election to the 20-member council was held on Friday and result for 19 seats were declared on Tuesday. Opposition Mizo National Front (MNF) emerged as single largest party winning eight seats, followed by Congress with six and BJP with five seats.
 
 Following a breakdown of talks between MNF and BJP over the sharing of posts in the council, there was an unprecedented development on Wednesday of Congress announcing that it would form a post-poll alliance with BJP to gain majority in the CADC.
 
 The joint legislature party was constituted on Wednesday which elected Santi Jiban   (BJP) as its leader and Buddha Lila Chakma (Congress) as deputy leader. Santi Jiban was tipped to become the CEM of the council.
 
 However, neither the BJP national leadership nor the state leaders agreed to forming a coalition with its arch-rival, especially in view of the coming election to the 40-member state assembly by the end of the year. After consultation with the party's elected council members, a top state BJP leader said the only way an alliance with the Congress members can be stitched is if they agree to leave the grand old party and form a new forum.
 
 BJP's northeast organisational secretary Ajay Jamwal rushed to state capital Aizawl to douse the crisis. "No question arises of our members going with Congress. The BJP-MNF alliance is based on a strong anti-Congress foundation, and it is this alliance that will head the CADC," BJP in-charge for Mizoram Pawan Sharma told TOI on Thursday.
