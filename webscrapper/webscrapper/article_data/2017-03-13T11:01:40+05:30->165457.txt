Our students are mature enough to play responsibly and we give them that freedom. We have no issues with them playing on our big campus, but they should steer clear of our galleries and sculptures,“ said  , principal.
 
 “We have declared a holiday on Monday so that students can celebrate the festival of colours. Also, we have designated an area within the college premises for students to celebrate,“ said Ajay Kumar, CEO, PESIT.   has also declared a holiday for its students.

They are, however, free to take the party elsewhere.
 
 Nivashni M, a student of  , said, “Our college has never allowed us to play with colours inside the campus. This year is no different.“
 
 Jayshree, principal,  , said while every year the college declares a holiday for Holi, this time it'll be classes as usual because students already got Sunday to celebrate. “In fact, they have an exam on Monday and I hope they are preparing for the same.“
 
 Students on their part have decided to have a splash at venues outside their colleges, as they don't want to invite trouble by breaking rules.
