Fame can sometimes be tricky. You may receive love from the most unexpected sources, but can also find yourself in a bit of a spot sometimes. Popular TV anchor-turned-actress   has now found 
herself in a bizarre controversy after a resident of   registered a complaint against her, for allegedly breaking her son’s phone, while he tried to take a selfie with her. The incident took place on Monday near Anasuya’s mother’s Tarnaka residence. 
 
 Confirming that an official complaint has been registered against the actress, G Jagan, SHO Osmania University Police Station, said, “Yes, we have received a complaint regarding this today. We are looking at the evidence and enquiring into this matter. From what we know,   had refused to take a selfie and while she was hurriedly leaving, the boy’s phone broke.”
 In a video, which went viral online, the complainant alleged that Anasuya had deliberately taken the phone out of her son’s hand and smashed it to pieces. She then shows the condition of the phone to the cameras and demands compensation for it.
 
 Anasuya, however, has rubbished the complainant’s claims and insists that she had done no such thing. “This is completely false. The lady is spreading lies. When I was coming out of my mum’s home, the lady, along with the boy, were taking my video and approached me for a selfie. I was not in the frame of mind to oblige, so I refused. However, when they came closer, I got annoyed. I covered my face, told them to get lost and hurriedly got into my car and drove off. I don’t remember any phone being broken,” the Jabardasth star said. Anasuya, who’ll next be seen in films like   and  , said this was one of the rare occasions when she denied a request for a selfie from a fan. “My friends always keep asking me why I agree to taking a selfie with each and every one who approaches me. But I always oblige. Yesterday, I just wasn’t in the mood and my wish has to be 
 respected,” the actress added.
