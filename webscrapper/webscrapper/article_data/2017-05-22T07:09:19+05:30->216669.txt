PUNE: Panic gripped the   when the   police found an object resembling a hand grenade kept in a plastic bag at   in the wee hours of Saturday.

 Several residents of the area came out on the road as the news spread like a wild fire,police said.
 
 Senior inspector (Chatushrungi police station)   told TOI that the bag contained a plastic tumbler with “the hand-grenade like object” inside it. “We got in touch with the   (BDDS). A team of the squad shifted the object to secured place and has preserved it for further analyses,” he said.
 
 “Army officers and BDDS experts have examined the object and the reports were awaited,” Dhome added.
 
 The bag near the PMPML bus stop off Ganeshkhind road was spotted by a youth around 12.30am by a youth, who come out of his house. 
 
 Out of curiosity, he looked inside the bag and found the “hand grenade-like” object inside, police said. He immediately raised an alarm and several residents gathered at the spot. They then called up the city police control room.
 
 Dhome said the bag had “Zsoing” written on it and other alphabets were blurred. 
 
 “We suspect that the object is very old and has been discarded. It has similarities with a hand grenade. But we cannot say if it is a hand grenade until official reports come in,” he said.
 
 However, the object does not belong to the army or defence forces, Dhome said. 
 
 Recently, police had found seven practice bombs of the army lying unattended to at the Dighi hills. Army authorities had forgotten the bombs behind after the day’s practice in the area. 
 
 A group of morning walkers had stumbled upon the bombs, which were handed over to the army officials.
