CHENNAI: Annoyed over continuous nonappearance of   officers in the court, particularly in habeas corpus petitions, where their attendance is required, the Madras high court has directed the director general of police not to send such officers on special duties when their attendance is required at a court.

 Adivision bench of Justices C T   and N   passed the order making it clear that it could not only apply to the present case but will apply to all future cases, wherever appearance of police officers are required.
 
 
 The bench passed the order while hearing a habeas corpus plea seeking to trace and produce a missing mentally ill woman.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing, the prosecution informed the court that the police officer concerned could not be present in the court as he was deputed on special duty.
 
 To this, the bench said, “Even in the earlier   we were informed that the Inspector of Police concerned was on VIP security duty. Now again in the present petition the same reason is citied for the official’s nonappearance. We hereby direct the DGP to ensure that the police officials whose presence is required in court at least in cases like HCP’s filed by anxious parents, brothers, sisters and relatives of missing persons.”
 
 The DGP shall ensure that the proceedings of this court are not hampered by posting the officers on other duty when their presence is necessary before this court, the bench added.
