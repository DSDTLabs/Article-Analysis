SILCHAR: Three Bangladeshi nationals, who were kept at a detention camp of   for last three-and-half years, were deported to Bangladesh on Tuesday through the international border in Karimganj after getting necessary approval from the MHA. 

 A senior official said BSF and   (Border) officials handed over the detainees -   (45),   (28) and Joel Ahmed (26) - to Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) at 12 noon on Tuesday. 
 
 All of them are from Sylhet division of the neighbouring country. Two of them were nabbed by the BSF after they crossed the Kushiyara river and entered India illegally. Another one was nabbed by police. 
 
 Under the existing law, they were tried in a local court and sent to jail. However, in the absence of any popular diplomatic procedure to repatriate them, the Bangladeshis were kept at a detention camp of the Silchar Central Jail after their sentence was over. 
 
 Earlier, 27 Bangladeshis were deported to their country. 
 
 A senior official said 29 other Bangladeshi and Myanmarese nationals are still languishing in the Silchar detention camp though their term of sentence is over.
