CHENNAI: Police security was beefed up at actor Rajinikanth’s   residence after a few   planned to besiege his house condemning his statement on the   anti-Sterlite protests.

 Rajinikanth, who visited the injured protesters at Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital on Wednesday, told reporters in the city that anti social elements were responsible for the violence on May 22 which led to the deaths of 13 people in police firing.
 
 His statement drew criticism from various political leaders and led to fringe outfits stating that they would lay siege to his house till he withdrew his statements.
 
 Following this, a large number of police personnel were posted near his residence. Even the actor’s fans were not allowed anywhere near the house since morning. “We have posted nearly 70 policemen near the actor’s house to avoid any untoward incidents,” said a police officer. In the morning, police personnel checked a few vehicles that came to Rajinikanth’s residence. Several layers of barricades were placed on the road to stop protesters from marching towards his house. However, no one arrived there to   as expected.
 
 Meanwhile,   is set to fly to Darjeeling this week for the shoot of his new film. The shoot is to last a month.
 
 On May 23, nearly 30 men from Tamilar Munnetra Padai, a fringe outfit, were picked up for staging a protest against the actor. The demonstration took place after Rajinikanth met with fans and hinted at making a foray into politics. Although he was then welcomed by major political parties in the state, this indication of his plans drew opposition from some pro-Tamil outfits. 
 
 They staged a protest on Cathedral Road and asserted that Tamil Nadu “should be ruled only by Tamils”.
