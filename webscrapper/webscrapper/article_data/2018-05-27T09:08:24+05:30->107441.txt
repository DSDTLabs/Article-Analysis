 LUCKNOW: Self-study and staying stress-free are the two success mantras that highscorers swear by.
 
 
 Sharing their experiences, they said pursuing their hobbies helped them handle examination stress all through the year. Besides, they maintained a ‘no’ to coaching classes to save both time and energy and depended on their classroom and self-study.
 
  
  
 
 Scoring 98.4%, Balbeer Yadav of   said it was music and football during board exams which proved to be stress busters for him.
 
 “I don’t believe in rote learning but in understanding concepts. When I was bored of revising my course, I would pick up my football and go out to play,” said Balbeer.
 
 Much to his parents’ surprise, Balbeer said he would solve mathematics numericals with his earphones plugged into his ears with his favourite music.
 
 Sharing the same score,   Mishra of Army Public School, SP Marg, said she was a fitness freak and exercising was her hobby.
 
 “Skipping and regular morning walks helped me stay relaxed and fresh. I am happy with my result as I was expecting 95% but ended up scoring 98.4%,” said Saumya, who believes that self-study is the best study.
 
 Divyanshi Mishra, another high-scorer from the same school with the same percentage said that reading fiction helped her tackle all exam-related tension.
 
 “I am a voracious reader. It was this hobby that helped me re-read and revise the syllabus again and again,” she said, adding that her friends were busy looking for the best coaching institutes but she trusted NCERT books and classroom teaching.
 
 A student of LPS Gomtinagar,  , who has scored 97.6%, believes being a bookworm is not the solution to scoring well.
 
 “One should not give up things which keep you calm and happy. I am an athlete, an amateur singer, and dancer. I continued with my hobbies even in class XII and they acted as stress busters for me,” said Sonam.
