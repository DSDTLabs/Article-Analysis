 The ailing elephant was found 2.5km away from the forest boundary near Narasipuram. On Sunday night, local veterinarians gave it nearly 100 bottles of saline along with calcium, vitamins and minerals. After the animal could not stand on its own, earth movers and cranes were pressed into service. However, on Monday evening, the elephant walked into the forest. 
 
 Manoharan, forest department veterinarian who conducted the postmortem, said the elephant had stomach infection. “It suffered from diarrhoea and there were parasites in its stomach. The elephant was old and its teeth had fallen. The muscles and bones had weakened,” he said.
