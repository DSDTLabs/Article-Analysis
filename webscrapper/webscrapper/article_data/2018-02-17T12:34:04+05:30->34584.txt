TRICHY:   always had a weakness for idli and vadacurry. At   in Chennai, where he grew up, he used to go scouting for eateries offering these dishes. After completing a catering course two decades ago, he decided to open an eatery in  , his hometown, to serve the unbeatable idli-vadacurry combo.

 Over the years, he set up eateries at different places in the city. But it was only last year that he got a real breakthrough.  , which he opened at  , is now a big draw in the locality. “Though my eatery had a slow start, customers loved what I served and through word of mouth the dishes became popular,” Aanand said.
 
 The idli-vadacurry combo was the most sought after. “Some people even come to my place from other areas for takeaways,” he said. One idli costs `5, while vadacurry costs `15 if eaten there and `25 for takeaway.
 
 Apart from that, onion adai, mushroom biryani and millet khichdis are also popular among customers.
 
 “I am very particular about serving hygienic and healthy food,” said Aanand, who is now 43. This is why he does not serve parottas. “I decided against serving parottas even though I know it isn’t the smartest of business moves. I don’t want people to eat food items that can be harmful to them,” he said.
 
 Between 50 and 70 people visit Aanand Catering daily. “On weekends, there are extra customers because I serve mushroom biryani on Saturdays and vegetable dosai on Sundays,” he stated.
 
 Aanand, who also did a stint as a football coach at Campion Anglo-Indian Higher Secondary School a few years ago, said it was with a heavy heart that he stopped serving adai aviyal at his eatery. “It was one item that was as popular as vadacurry over here. But as coconut prices increased, I wasn’t able to afford aviyal – this remains a big regret,” he said.
 
 On his future plans, Aanand says, “I want to rent a place out and start a restaurant soon – I’m confident that I will be able to achieve this dream by the end of this year.”
