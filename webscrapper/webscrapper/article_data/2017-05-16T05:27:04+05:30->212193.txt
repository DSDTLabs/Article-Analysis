NEW DELHI: Historical details about that bronze statue of the reclining Buddha will soon be the click of a smartphone away. 

 To make   easily accessible to visitors at museums and monuments across the country, the ministry of culture and tourism has decided to roll out ‘eguides’ at historical sites across the country.
 
 The e-guide, which is available free of cost to visitors once they download the   on their android mobile phones, will allow them to take guided tours without needing someone to chaperon them around. 
 
 At present, while the e-guide has already been launched for about 55 artefacts of the 1000 stored in the   in the national capital, e-content is also being readied for the other historical products and artefacts at museums and in monuments across the country.
 
 Sources in the ministry of culture said the content creation, which contains contextual audios and videos, is a time-taking process, but is being readied keeping in mind the need to improve a visitor’s experience when she visits.
 
 The audio-video content will be made available through intranet — museum areas are being made   — and will allow visitors to hook on to the intranet and scan the QR code placed beside each artefact for a detailed information about it. “Visitors can get all the information they need by scanning the QR code on their phone,” a ministry official said.
