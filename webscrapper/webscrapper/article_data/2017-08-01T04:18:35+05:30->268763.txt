GHAZIABAD: Residents of   in Indirapuram are being forced to pay through their nose to clear the sewer water that has entered their houses after Monday’s downpour. With no response from the   after several complaints, the   has hired a JBC, a tractor-trolley and labourers to get the 200-foot-long stretch of open sewer line cleaned outside the residential society.

 “We have been suffering for years now. We have been trying to reach out to GDA officials for the last three months before the arrival of the monsoon to fix the problem beforehand but despite sending complaints on the GDA website a number of times, no one responded. We also tried calling the registered GDA number many times but no response,” said Shekhar Yadav, RWA president of India Moon City Society. 
 
 The residents’ welfare association spent Rs 10,000 to get the main connecting sewer line outside cleaned. 
 
 “Doing the cleaning job on GDA’s behalf, the drain in our area has slightly improved but till such time that other establishments like Shanti Gopal Hospital and neighbouring societies get their sewer lines cleared, the problem will persist,” Yadav said.
 
 According to residents, due to the choked drains, the overflowing rainwater had entered the apartments of the ground-floor residents and because of the pressure, the sewer water had flooded the kitchens in many houses. 
 
 Many residents complained that they were unable to cook food in their kitchens owing to the stench emanating from the water. 
 
 Residents were also worried because the stagnant water worsened the risk of chikungunya and malaria. There are 150 families living in as many flats in the society.
