PANCHKULA: Minerva Punjab’s title aspirations received a jolt as giant-killers   Kerala sprung a surprise with a 1-0 win in their Hero I-League match at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium here on Tuesday.

 
 For Gokulam, it is the third straight upset they have engineered after shocking Kolkata’s ‘big two’, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, in their previous two outings.
 
 Henry Kiseka scored the winner for the Malabarians in the 75th minute in sublime fashion. A short cross by Provat Lakra was taken first time by Henry. The ball hit the crossbar and fell straight to Henry again who scored with a sensational bicycle kick.
 
 The victory over the title contenders from Punjab keeps Gokulam in the hunt for a direct Super Cup qualification spot as Minerva were left to rue their second straight home loss after last week’s defeat to East Bengal. It also reopens the title race as East Bengal lie only three points behind Minerva with both sides having played 15 games.
 
 With this win, Gokulam climbed to sixth place, whereas Minerva still hold on to second spot behind NEROCA (31 points) who, however, have played two games more.   made four tactical changes in their squad from their previous encounter against East Bengal as Amandeep Singh, Shouvik Das, Bazie Armand and   made way for debutant left-back Akashdeep Singh, left winger  , defensive midfielder Randeep Singh and Nepal international goalkeeper Kiran Kumar Limbu.
 
 Gokulam Kerala, on the other hand, were forced to make four changes to their squad due to suspension and injury issues. The tactical changes made by Minerva didn’t pay off as Gokulam dominated the match and were denied by the crossbar on three occasions before they managed to get their hard-earned goal.
