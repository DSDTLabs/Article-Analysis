GAYA:  , a village predominantly inhabited by   (SC) and extremely backward caste (EBC) people on the southern outskirts of the town, was adopted by   on Sunday. The village will be converted into a   with all amenities, including medical assistance and skill development.
 
  Club president-elect Mridula Narain said the village with a 1,000-plus population has been identified for all-round infrastructural development and psychological upliftment to make villagers conscious about their entitlements and set their priorities in such a way that their limited resources are put to maximum use.
  
  A psychological counsellor by profession, Narain said no less important was the psychological upliftment of the villagers and induction of positivism to harness and channelise the energy of the villagers to facilitate qualitative change in their lives. “Besides introducing skill development programmes aimed at securing gainful and respectable job opportunities, we would be organising regular health camps,” said Narain.
  
  Awareness creation for sanitation and its linkage with issues related to health and hygiene was also part of the roadmap prepared for the village’s development. Regular programmes, including forestation, blood donation and sports promotion activities will also be done.
