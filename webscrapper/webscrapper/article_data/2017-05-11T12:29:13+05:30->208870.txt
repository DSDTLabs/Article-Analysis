BHUBANESWAR: The   (KISS) on Wednesday signed a   with Bhartia Charitable Trust to set up a  , a free residential school for children of   at Puri. The school will start operations from July 2018 and will follow CBSE curriculum. 

 "Our objective is to provide quality education to poor Brahmin children, who do not get any kind of reservation or facilities from the government. The school will be the first of its kind in India and will follow the KISS model," said the founder of KIIT and KISS, Achyuta Samanta. 
 
 Besides school education, students will also be given special training on Veda, Karmakanda (rituals) and theology, with special emphasis on Jagannath. "After completing their education from the school, they will be able to establish themselves as well-trained and educated priests. Students must be from the below poverty line (BPL) category and those from Puri will get preference," Samanta said. 
 
 The Bhartia Charitable Trust will provide financial assistance of Rs 15 crore for infrastructural development of the school which will be set up on 15 acres of land by the Puri-Konark road. The school will start off with 1,200 students enrolled between class I to XII. 
 
 The foundation stone of the school will be laid on the day of Debasnana Purnima on June 9 this year. "We are immensely grateful to KISS authorities for providing us this opportunity to help poor Brahmin children," said Kishanlal Agarwal, chairman of the trust. 
 
 Samanta said, 20 states in India have evinced interest to set up KISS for free education to tribal children. "Some progress has been made to set up KISS in Jharkhand while KISS, Delhi, has been running successfully for the last few years. Six more branches of KISS are to come up in six districts of Odisha soon and we have plans to set up 20 branches in different districts of the state," Samanta said. Unlike KISS, Bhubaneswar, poor students from all categories can study in the district branches, he added.
