GUWAHATI: The state unit of   said on Monday that it will fight the upcoming rural bodies' elections alone. 

 "The executive meeting of our party has decided that BJP will fight the panchayat polls alone. Our president Ranjit Kumar Das has instructed all our workers to help the government's welfare schemes reach the beneficiaries at the grassroots and keep a strict vigil to ensure that these schemes are not mired in corruption," BJP spokesperson   said here on Monday. 
 
 During the two-day executive meeting on Friday and Saturday, the party pitched "Congress-mukt" rural bodies. The majority of panchayat bodies are now under Congress. 
 
 BJP had formed a coalition government in the state with   (AGP) and Bodoland People's Front (BPF) after sweeping the assembly elections last summer. The panchayat election is crucial for the saffron party to continue its victory graph initiated in the 2014   elections, when BJP won seven of 14 parliamentary seats for the first time in the history of the state. BJP also won the maximum number of seats in the urban local bodies' election. 
 
 Meanwhile, another BJP spokesperson Subhash Dutta responded to allegations that the party is targeting the minority community in the eviction drive by the state government. "Freeing government and satra lands from encroachers is BJP's commitment," he said, going on to say that the saffron party does not indulge in "religion-centric politics".
 
 Both spokespersons said encroachers on lands belonging to masjid, churches and other places of worship will also be evicted.
