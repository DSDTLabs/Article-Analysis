CHENNAI: Residents from areas around   have raised 3,000 signatures in a petition to reduce   rail fares. The petition was also signed by residents of  , Pazhavanthangal, Madipakkam, Adambakkam, and Kilkattalai.

 When the CMRL was extended to Nanganallur, residents were a happy lot since their travel options were limited by the lack of bus stops on GST Road. The nearest bus stops on the road to Nanganallur are in Alandur and then 3km away, outside Tirusulam. But the hefty charges for metro rides have discouraged many from using the service. “We have a metro stop at Nanganallur and it is a convenient option for us. But the pricing is prohibitive. We hope the state government will address the issue,” said V   of the Traffic and Transportation Forum.
 
 Locals plan to raise more signatures for the petition, with a target of at least 5,000 until next week. “Once we reach that figure, we will submit it to the managing director of CMRL by May 12,” said  , a resident. “We also plan to meet the CM once we have met CMRL officials,” he added.
 
 Metro rail officials, however, said the rates were fixed after looking at the fares in other cities, adding that it was unlikely they would be revised.
