BHOPAL: By announcing many schemes to develop city's old   -  ,   has triggered speculations about his  . Observers read in it a sign of his preparing ground to contest election from a constituency from where he had lost the assembly election by a slender margin in 2013. 

 Sharma is not shy about projecting him as the first mayor of the state capital, born and brought up in Bhopal. "Development has to be across the city. Hamidia Road is a major commercial hub that needs to be further redeveloped," he said.
 
 Walled city development also found a mention in Mayor's early budget speech. He announced a 1,800 meter grid separator costing about Rs 80 crore. It would be at   intersection, where former chief minister Babulal Gaur famously led the demolition charge of around 50 shops. Sharma's grid separator would cost Rs 80 crore and already received Rs 20 crore from CM infrastructure fund. The grid separator would connect Bharat Talkies to bus stand. Sharma announced scheme for redevelopment of Nadra Bus Stand at Hamidia Road.
 
 A much-hyped scheme is the proposed development of a commercial hub at Old Sabzi Mandi. The empty space along Hamidia Road and lies between Nadra Bus Stand and Bhopal's main railway station. 
 
 Old Sabzi mandi would be a commercial hub with shops, waiting space, multiplex and shopping complex, Sharma said. A skywalk from railway station to bus stand along Hamidia Road has also been incorporated into the budget.
