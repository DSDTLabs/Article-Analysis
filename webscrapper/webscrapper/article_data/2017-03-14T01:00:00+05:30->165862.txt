Patience has paid off for actor  , who debuted with a bang in Subhash Ghai’s 'Black & White' (2008). Years later, he is back on the screen with Nikhil Advani’s show, '  - Bandi Yuddh Ke'. Anurag, who plays Lt Siddhant Thakur in the political thriller, says, “I’m so fortunate to work with Nikhil. He is so honest and clear about his work. The kind of conviction with which he works, no one can stop him or his show from getting what it deserves.” Elaborating on his camaraderie with Nikhil, he adds, “I was supposed to do a film called Lucknow Central with him, but it didn’t materialise. We met again later and he offered me this role. It has so many shades that it’s very challenging.”

 Despite a much -appreciated debut, the actor didn’t land interesting roles in Bollywood. “I did ' ', but it didn’t release. I was supposed to do a film called 'Sarabjit', which didn’t happen either. But the trust and belief my family and friends had in me kept me going. I believe that after the darkest storm, the sun will shine again. So, I kept trying and I’m happy 'POW' came my way. I have few more interesting and meaty projects lined up,” he signs off.
