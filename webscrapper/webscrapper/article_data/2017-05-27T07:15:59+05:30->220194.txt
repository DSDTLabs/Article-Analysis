VADODARA: The   (VMC) stopped work on removing foliage from the Vishwamitri river after workers were signed off regarding the presence of crocodiles there. The civic body had started removing bushes and other vegetation from the riverbed and its banks as a part of its pre-monsoon works. The   was using a heavy chained excavator behind the   to do so.

 Forest officials came to know regarding the work and rushed to the spot as the stretch of the river has several crocodiles and their nests. The officials told the VMC workers about the crocodile population there and asked them to exercise caution while working there. 
 
 The incident, however, triggered rumours that eggs of crocodiles were run over by the excavator.
