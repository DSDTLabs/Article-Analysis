AHMEDABAD: A city sessions court on Saturday granted conditional bail to  , who was arrested earlier this week by   police on charges of abetting the suicide of his stepson.

 Additional sessions judge, P B Singh, granted bail to Hemnani on condition of furnishing bail bond of Rs 25,000. 
 
 The court has restrained him from going abroad without its prior permission. Hemnani got bail after his advocate,  , argued that the suicide had taken place more than a month ago. 
 
 He said Hemnani had been falsely implicated in the matter because of the acrimonious relationship between him and his divorced wife, Chanda.
 
 The lawyer also submitted that the accused was not in contact with his stepson for a long time, and on the day his 19-year-old stepson Hitesh committed suicide, he was not present in the city. 
 
 He supplied proof showing that Hemnani was in Surat on the day. It was also argued that due to sour relationship with his wife, he stays away from the family and he was implicated in the case at a belated stage.
 
 Hemnani was arrested after Chanda complained that Hitesh committed suicide because of his constant harassment.
