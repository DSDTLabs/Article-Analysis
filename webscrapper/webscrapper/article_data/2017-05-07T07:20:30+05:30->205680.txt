UDAIPUR: An   officer has lodged a complaint of misbehaviour and manhandling against cops at the   police station here on Saturday. 

 Mirza Ali Baig, deputy director of income tax (Investigation wing) said in his complaint that on Friday night a police team barged into his home and assaulted his mother, two sisters among whom one was pregnant and abused his brother without any reason. 
 
 Baig who reported the matter online to the Prime Minister's Office said that the incident took place around 8.40 pm on Friday when few policemen barged into his house. All of them were drunk. Two of them were in uniforms while others were civil dressed. They abused Baig's sisters when they tried to stop them and slapped his brother when he asked about their identities. When Baig intervened and asked for a search warrant, the cops threatened him and said that they would return with a larger force and then he would have to see more. The official reported the matter to the SP who asked him to give a written complaint. Later it was known that it had been a case of mistaken identity as the policemen had a warrant to be served to someone else with the same surname but they entered the official's home. On Saturday, two constables among the team who had reportedly misbehaved, were removed from the police station and sent to lines, sources said. Authorities avoided to comment.
