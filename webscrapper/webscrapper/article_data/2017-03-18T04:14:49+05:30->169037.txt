NOIDA: Members of India Industries Association (IIA), Noida, an umbrella body of industrialists, met with G B Nagar’s   elect,   on Friday morning to seek a deduction in power tariff for industrialists in the city. They also made an appeal for the implementation of a single window clearance of all licensing and permits for operating a business.

 “Despite Noida being an industrial hub, it has not been easy for the industrialists to do business here. In the initial stages when someone wants to start an enterprise, people run from door-to-door to put the licences together,” Rajiv Bansal, chairman, Noida IIA, said.
 
 “The first few years are crucial for a business and the system should facilitate new enterprise instead of pushing the founder from pillar to post. We urge that the single window system of operation and licencing for setting up of business be implemented,” Bansal added.
 
 IIA members also spoke about the need for looking into the law and order situation in the industrial sectors of 58, 59, 62, 63 and the SEZ areas.
 
 “Noida’s law and order system has improved over the years. However, people who come to work in the industrial areas and leave late at night often complain about roadside snatching and other petty crimes. ” Bansal added.
 
 IIA members said that Singh had assured them that he would extend his support on the points put across by them.
