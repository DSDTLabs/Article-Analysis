With students across the country appearing for the board exams, a number of D-day goof-ups are bound to happen. Here's what you should do in case of a problematic situation

 
 
 
 
 If this is the scenario, rush to your school or college with a written application requesting for a duplicate hall ticket.  't forget to mention your seat number. After you pay a   issuance fee, your letter, along with one from the school, will be sent to the board, and you will receive a duplicate copy soon.
 
 
 
 
 Firstly, don't assume that you cannot appear for the exam. On reaching the centre, immediately inform the exam supervisor who in turn will inform the exam conductor of the centre. If you are carrying a photocopy of your hall ticket, hand it over to the supervisor. You will be permitted to write that exam. After you finish your paper, submit a written letter to your exam centre stating the loss of your hall ticket and then apply for a duplicate copy at your school/college.
 
 
 
 
 If you forget the hall ticket at home, present a photocopy of the hall ticket to the supervisor and you will be allowed to write the exam. However, before you leave the exam centre, you will have to give a written application stating that you will bring along the original hall ticket the next day, or better still, ask your parent to send in the hall ticket before the paper ends. Needless to say, you should always carry a photocopy of your hall ticket.
 
 
 
 
 Speak to the authorities in charge of the centre you have reached. The exam conductor will investigate whether the case is genuine. If yes, you will be allowed to appear for the paper. Make sure you leave well in advance for your examinations. Remember, you will not be allowed to appear for a paper 20 minutes post its commencement.
