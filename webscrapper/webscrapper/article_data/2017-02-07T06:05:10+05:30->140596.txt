KOLKATA: A promoter living as a tenant in a two-storeyed house in   was arrested on Monday after he allegedly assaulted, threatened and demanded Rs 1 crore from the septuagenarian house owners for moving out of the property.

 Police said the original tenant Omprakash Gupta had brought another person Suresh Gupta (55) to live on the ground floor of CD 258 and had himself left the house before the end of the tenancy period in November 2010. When the elderly couple — Keshab and Protima Chowdhury — asked Gupta to leave, he threatened them, saying they could either let him construct a flat on the top floor of the house or pay him Rs 1 crore to leave. Gupta had not even paid the Rs 3,000 rent for the 2,000sqft space for the past several months.
 
 The couple said they had intimated   police station about how Gupta was living there illegally, but they allegedly did not take any action. A complaint was also lodged last October after Gupta allegedly hit the woman when she asked him to leave.
 
 Chowdhury said Gupta pressurized them to sell the house at a throwaway price or pay him Rs 1 crore. “It looks like the man wanted to drive away the couple and take possession of the property,” said an officer. If convicted, Gupta can be jailed for a maximum of 10 years.
