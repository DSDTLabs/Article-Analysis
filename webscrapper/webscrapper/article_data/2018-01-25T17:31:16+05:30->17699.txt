Giving a message of communal harmony, a play “Ve Log” was staged at Abhinav Kala Samaj Hall on Saturday. The play focussed on the ideologies of freedom fighters   and Ramprasad Bismil, before they planned to loot a train in Kakori. The play brought to light glimpses from   train incident. It revolved around Ashfaq’s group, that wanted to loot the train near Kakori, but Ashfaq was not fully convinced with the idea. However, later he agreed to do so after being provoked a lot by his group members who were keen to carry out the robbery. The artistes interspaced the play with poems and songs that were delivered daringly. The play was directed by Raghav and was written by Piyush Bhalse.
