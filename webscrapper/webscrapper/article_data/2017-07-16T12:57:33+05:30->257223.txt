VIJAYAWADA: Speakers at a meeting organised to oppose the new   policy in the state asked women not to give up their fight against liquor until the government withdraws the liquor permits and agrees to enforce total prohibition.

 Progressive Democratic Front MLC V Balasubrahmanyam wanted women to take the fight to its end by mounting pressure on the government to withdraw the new liquor policy. He took strong exception to the government opening more liquor shops and bars across the state. He also blamed the government for denotifying the highways into district roads to bypass the   ban on liquor shops along highways. The PDF MLC promised to speak up for them in the Legislative Council and asked the women to continue their fight. He said easy availability of liquor was ruining family life in the villages with men getting addicted to alcohol and women becoming widows.
 
 Senior journalist and former information commissioner P Vijaya Babu blamed the government for booking cases against women who have been staging agitations demanding prohibition. He also criticised the government for increasing the number of liquor outlets both in urban and rural areas. He said the government was becoming dependent on liquor revenue and is encouraging people to consume more liquor.
 
 All India Democratic Womensâ€™ Association state secretary D Ramadevi asked the government to launch a campaign against liquor consumption and discourage sale of liquor. She reiterated that the women in the state would continue to fight against liquor and appealed to people to support the movement. Progressive Organisation of Women leader M Lakshmi, National Federation of Indian Women leader P Durga Bhavani, Liquor Regulation Struggle Committee leader V Lakshmana Reddy, Jana Vignana Vedika leader J Krishna Kishore poke at the meeting.
