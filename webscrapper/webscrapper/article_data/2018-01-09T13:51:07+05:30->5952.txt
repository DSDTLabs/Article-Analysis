ALWAR:   candidate from   parliamentary seat Dr   on Monday filed his nomination papers in the presence of a large number of followers and leaders from the state.

 He took out a rally from the party election office covering many important localities in the city and reached Jagnnath Mandir. He presented four sets of nomination papers to the district collector and returning officer Rajan Vishal. Former Union minister   and former   Juber Khan are among five proposers of his nomination. 
 
 Dr Karan Singh Yadav said he would be available to the people 24/7 and sought vote for development. He accused the BJP government of mismanagement.
 
 Former CM  , who was present on the occasion, said it is time to give this government a shock treatment. He claimed that neither the BJP won in Gujarat nor Congress was defeated. It was only a question of 10 seats and those who talk about Congress Mukt Bharat should be prepared to get eliminated from power.
 
 “BJP leaders who had belittled Congress president   had to eat a humble pie after Gujarat polls,” he said.
 
 He said that BJP and RSS are misleading people by spreading falsehood that Congress is a party of Muslims. They believe only RSS and BJP are Hindus and rest are non-Hindus.
 
 If Congress wins all three seats in the bypoll, it will send out a clear message to the whole country. He alleged that development has come to a standstill in Alwar as many of the Congress government projects were abandoned by BJP government.
 
 PCC president   said the victory of Congress candidate should be historic as a response to the ‘jumla’ of BJP. He demanded resignation of BJP candidate from the state ministry before contesting the polls. Pilot informed that all senior leaders would attend the nomination of party candidates Raghu Sharma in Ajmer and Viveck Dhakar in Mandalgarh.
