 This will keep students strength low in all schools on the day of reopening on June 1,” said a headmaster of a higher secondary school in the city.
 
 Sources from the school education department said that some   of the chief educational officer (CEO),   to reopen next week. 
 
 However, the CEO categorically shot down any such move and also sent out a message that action may be initiated against the schools that remain closed on Friday.
