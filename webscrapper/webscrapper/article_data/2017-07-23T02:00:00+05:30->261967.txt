PATNA: The Patna Municipal Corporation ( ) will soon invite bids to select a project management consultancy for its Smart City project.

 “We will float the tenders within a fortnight,” PMC commissioner Abhishek Singh told TOI on his return from Delhi where he attended a meeting called by the Union urban development ministry in this regard.
 
 Singh said the selected consultant would further make a detailed project report and study the projects undertaken by other smart cities.
 
 He said a special purpose vehicle (SPV) would be formed simultaneously so that the execution work was not delayed. “We have taken this lesson from other cities which first formed the SPV and then selected the consultancy, ending up late,” said Singh.
 
 The meeting held on Thursday and Friday was attended by representatives of all the smart cities selected under the Centre’s project. State urban development and housing department’s principal secretary Chaitanya Prasad also attended the meet.
 
 Singh said they were briefed on how to carry forward the work and which projects should be taken first. There was also a session on how to raise funds for the project. 
 
 Singh said the PMC would send a team to other cities to see how they were executing the work.
