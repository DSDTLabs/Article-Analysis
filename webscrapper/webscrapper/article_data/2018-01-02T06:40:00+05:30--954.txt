Haveri: While the population of pigs has been increasing in the city for the past year, the City Municipal Council CMC has allegedly not been able to come out with any solution to tackle this problem.

 After previous CMC president Manjunath Bistannavar was attacked by pig owners, the population of pigs has almost doubled as the local body has not launched any drive to catch pigs. To add to this, pig catchers are also not showing interest to catch pigs as they are allegedly facing threat from pig owners.
 
 “Pigs are straying across the city, including in sophisticated residential areas like Basaveshwar Nagar, Viday Nagar and Dhaneshwari Nagar. The residents are suffering from viral diseases due to the menace,” said Ashok Bogar, a resident of Basaveshwar Nagar.
 
 He alleged that elected representatives of the local body have no concern for the city’s cleanliness or any intention to make the pig free. “Residents of our area will launch an agitation against the CMC if it fails to start a drive to catch pigs as soon as possible,” he added.
 
 Mohan Kulkarni, a resident of Daneshwari Nagar, said the population of pigs has increased drastically, becoming a menace to those living in residential areas. “The CMC should launch pig catching drive immediately,” he urged.
 
 CMC Commissioner B S Shivakumar said, “We have received several complaints regarding pig menace. We have warned pig owners against letting pigs roam around the city. We are also preparing to start a drive against pig.”
 
 CMC president Parvatemma Halagannavar said that before launching the pig catching drive, the CMC should prepare to the address law and order situation as pig owners would not be happy with the drive. “We have approached pig catchers in Hassan. They said they would start the drive after Ganesha festival. So we will write to the police requesting for deployment of extra forces during the drive,” she added.
