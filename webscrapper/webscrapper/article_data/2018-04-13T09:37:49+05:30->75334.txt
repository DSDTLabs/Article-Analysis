MYSURU: In what could set a trend and prove to be boon for the hospitality industry, travel agents in   are mulling introducing an election package for foreign tourists to unravel the carnival that Indian polls are with their colourful rallies and campaign trails.

 
 Cashing in on the upcoming May 12  , Mysuru-based travel agent BS Prashanth, who is also an office-bearer of  , has been promoting the concept among his contacts and is trying to woo few overseas tourists.
 
 He has circulated the message among 70 different travel agents across India to reach out to foreign tourists visiting India for conducting election tours.
 
 Prashanth said India has great scope for election tourism but little has been done to tap its potentiality. There were efforts to introduce Indian elections to the world earlier in Gujarat and Kerala. “Karnataka being a major destination for foreign tourists we have good prospects,” he said.
 
 “Our plan is to take foreign tourists to election campaigns, events and rallies in Mysuru and show them how elections in India are fought. They will also be taken to villages nearby to give them a real experience of democracy in India. I’m sure tourists would love the experience,” Prashanth said.
 
 “We’re in the process of making a 3-5 minute promotional video and use them on social media to reach out to a large number of tourists. I have a few open jeeps that will come in handy for this election tourism,” he said.
 
 Tourism deputy director   said the election tour idea seemed to be a good one. “We’re really open to any such initiatives to introduce our republic to the people of all nations,” he said.
