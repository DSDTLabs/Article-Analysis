The Union Budget has little on offer for   as no state-specific reforms or funds were announced. However, a sector-specific scheme to promote employment in the leather industry could indirectly benefit the state. The scheme will be similar to the one launched for the textile industry in June 2016. The textile industry package had a corpus of Rs 6,000 crore and was aimed at generating 1 crore jobs in the next three years.

 A similar package for the leather industry would indirectly benefit Tamil Nadu as it commands 40% of the total leather exports out of India. “We are waiting to check the details of the package; whether there are clauses such as fixed time for employment, additional TUFS (Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme) and environment funding in place. If these measures are implemented, the exporters are bound to benefit more than the others,“ said Rafeeque Ahmed, chair man,   and former chairman of the Council of Leather Exports.
 
 Industrial clusters in Vellore, Chennai, Trichy, Dindigul and Erode ship close to $2.5 billion worth of leather and footwear exports annually. Tanneries and footwear manufacturing predominate in these areas.
 
 Ahmed added that Tamil Nadu's 400 leather factories, which currently employ close to 1.5 lakh people, could see an addition of 1 lakh jobs thanks to the scheme. “We are also hopeful of a leather park being set up in the state, which is most likely to be constructed in Trichy,“ he said.
 
 The move could boost leather exports which registered negative growth in the last two years owing to the beef ban and unfavourable market conditions in the European Union. The announcement also assumes significance as the commerce and industry ministry has suggested incentives for the leather and footwear sector, given its importance under the Make in India initiative.
