CHENNAI: Police on Friday arrested three men for the January 22   in   of a 30-year-old employee of a cardboard manufacturing firm. A man named Thirumalai got Kailash beaten to death by his friends  , 22, and  , 19, because he allegedly stalked and harassed Thirumalai’s fiancee, a police officer said.

 A Ponneri court has sent all the three accused to jail.
 
 After Kailash’s body was recovered from a clump of bushes, police registered a case and began investigations, but were unable to make a breakthrough for a long time.
 
 Investigators began sifting through the call records of Kailash and made a list of the calls he received before he was murdered.
 
 A senior police officer said that one of the most frequently received calls on the phone was from Thirumalai, a colleague of Kailash at the company at Vilangadupakkam near Red Hills. “We probed further and found that Thirumalai ahd disappeared immediately after the murder came to light and did not report back at work for a few days,” the officer added.
 
 A police team then nabbed Thirumalai from a hideout on Saturday and questioned him. He admitted to the crime and led police to his friends Vijay Prakash and Ajith Kumar, residents of Vilankadu near Red Hills.
 
 Inquiries revealed that Kailash had been constantly stalking and harassing Thirumalai’s fiancee, who was employed in the same firm. The woman complained to Thirumalai about the harassment and he informed his two friends. The three then planned to eliminate Kailash, the officer said.
 
 As per the plan, Thirumalai invited Kailash to a place near his house, where Ajith Kumar and Vijay Prakash were waiting. The men first confronted Kailash over the issue of harassing Thirumalai’s fiancée and tried to strike a compromise. But, the quarrel intensified and Ajith Kumar and Vijay Prakash beat Kailash to death. Then they dumped his body outside the house and fled.
