In the   house which thrives on drama and fake camaraderie, she stood out for her genial outlook. And now, it seems like Rekha isn’t willing to compromise on her ways even when it comes to her on-screen assignments. The actor, who is popularly known as Sparsha Rekha, is currently part of the daily soap   and confesses that she is genuinely enjoying her second outing on   after the recent Bigg Boss. 

 “Veteran actor Padma Vasanthi is the reason behind me taking up this show. Another reason I agreed to the role was because it is about a mother who will go to any length to protect her child. As a mother of two myself, I related to it instantly. Also it has an extremely positive message and that’s something I’m particular about when I take up any role. I won’t don loud, garish makeup and play vampish parts. That’s not me,” she states. 
 Rekha adds that although she wasn’t exactly looking to do television at this point, she loved working with Naveen Krishna who is helming Pattedhari Prathibha.
 
  “Maybe because he’s an actor himself, he knew what to expect out of a mainstream actor in a television show,” she avers. And even though many TV offers are coming her way, she isn’t taking up anything as of now. “I’m more inclined towards doing films, hence no small screen assignment has piqued my interest, yet,” she signs off.
