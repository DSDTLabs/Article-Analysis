VADODARA: Residents of old city area will heave a sigh of relief from traffic from March 19, as the   will start to function at the complex in Dilwalipura. The new building will be inaugurated by the dignitaries of   and state government on March 17.

 The new complex built on 55,000 square metre land in Vaccine Institute will start operating from March 19. The court administration has started making arrangements to shift records and furniture to the new building from the heritage Nyay Mandir that has been temple of justice for 120 years.
 
 “We will start shifting of records and other things from March 8 and the work continue for days and nights so that we are prepared to begin operations from March 19,” said Prakash Trivedi, registrar, district court. He added that those litigants who have their case dates from March 19 onwards will have to come at the new complex for hearing.
 
 One of the major reasons for building the new court complex was traffic issue in the area around Nyay Mandir and the lack of space in the heritage buildings. The new complex will fix this problem to a greater extent as there is parking space for at least 3,500 visitors. However, the issue of sitting arrangement for the lawyers still lingers as the annexe building in the campus, which will be for lawyers, has capacity for only 1,500 lawyers. Court officials said that the   will decide about allotment of places and making arrangements in the annexe building.
 
 According to sources, the Nyay Mandir building and Laal Court will remain in the custody of legal department even after these buildings are vacated. The High Court will decide and later hand over the custody of the buildings to the concerned department of the state government.
