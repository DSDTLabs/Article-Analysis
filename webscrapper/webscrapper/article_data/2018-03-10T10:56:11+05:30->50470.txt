THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Jury chairman   made two interesting remarks on the side lines of   declaration. “We haven't looked at faces, we have only watched films,” he told media persons.

 The jury, which had several parallel filmmakers, bucked the pattern followed for years, tossing away predictable choices and picking up unheard ones. “There is this usual pattern of recognising one or two parallel film makers and then distributing remaining awards to popular figures. The focus was on appreciating movies which approached the medium seriously and attempted to experiment artistically,” said  , a jury member.
 
 
 The jury paid attention to meritorious works that were part of mainstream like ‘Take Off’ and ‘Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum’, but with restraint. Lijo Jose Pellissery was lauded as the best director for his film ‘Ea.Ma.Yau’, but Angamaly Diaries, which had earlier bagged critical and popular acclaim, never figured in jury’s scheme of things.
 
 The prestigious awards went for lesser or scarcely known entities. The jury did not even have to debate on ‘Ottamuri velicham’. “If we hadn't unearthed this film here, it would have been lost forever. It has been the case for so many independent filmmakers. We didn't want that to happen,” said Manoj Kana, another jury member.
 
 Of the 37 awards, 27 have been won by debutantes. More than half of the total films watched by the jury were made by debutant directors.
 
 The selection to   hardly mattered to this jury. Of the two films featured in competition section of IFFK, the jury found worth in only film: Sanju Surendran’s ‘Aedan’. ‘Sexy Durga’, which did not make it to the competition section of IFFK but won the top honour at Rotterdam film festival, was shunned by the jury.
 
 It is learnt that Sexy Durga did not even make it to the list of 23 movies which were filtered from 110 movies. “The film was omitted in the first round itself. The jury was unanimous in that decision,” said a jury member.
