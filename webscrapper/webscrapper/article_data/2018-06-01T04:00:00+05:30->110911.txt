Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) plan to provide every housing society in the city with CCTV network and Wi-Fi facility has failed to take off.  This has compelled SMC to think of issuing a fresh tender for the project with modified conditions. The civic body plans to provide CCTV network and Wi-Fi facility to around 5,000 housing societies in the city, mostly from MLA and MP grants. It will set aside Rs1 lakh for CCTV network and Rs 20,000 for Wi-Fi facility for each of the housing societies.  The CCTV network and Wi-Fi facility plan was drawn up by the civic body 18 months ago. The Wi-Fi would have reduced the internet bill of a household to half. But the project could not take off because SMC stipulated societies, which had paid all dues for water, drainage, street light, incremental charges, etc, would only be eligible. “No housing society or contractor showed any interest in the scheme because of stringent conditions of the tender. Also, majority of the housing societies already have their own CCTV networks,” said Bakulesh Parikh, president of a housing society in Vesu. PWC, a multinational professional services company, had reportedly given technical advice to the civic body on the tender. The camera specifications sought were so high that no one showed any interest, sources said. An SMC officer said, “We plan to issue fresh tender after amending the specifications for the equipment. This should generate enough interest among the contractors.”
