CHENNAI: After forty years of treatment involving a quarter of a million  , partial knee   has finally piqued the   here.

 While most patients with severe arthritis continue to opt for full knee replacement, surgeons are increasingly recommending that they go for implants which are custom-made to fit the size of the damaged portion, instead of just replacing the entire joint. This, they say, is minimally invasive, cheaper, and patients usually experience less pain and quicker recovery time. The implants are made of metal alloy and strong plastic. 
 
 At least 40% of patients with severe arthiritis require knee replacement, and in 30% of them, only partial joint replacement is needed, say doctors who met in the city to chart out a course for a two-day workshop for surgeons to train in the procedure. 
 
 Dr Chris Dodd, honorary clinical lecturer, University of Oxford, has been witness to this quiet transformation. Inserting smaller implants in just an isolated damaged compartment of a knee joint was mooted in the early 1950s. However, the concept hit rough weather as the implants were poorly designed, patients were not thoroughly screened for suitability, and surgical techniques were crude. India’s nascent attempts also floundered for the same reasons. 
 
 According to Dodd, with newer advancements, the procedure has caught the attention of the surgical community again. “We have tracked 70-year-olds having their implants intact till their deaths in their late 90s,” he said, adding that a majority of thesurgeries were done in the last five years. 
 
 Dr Vijay Bose, senior consultant, Institute of Orthopaedics, SIMS Hospital, said his team had done at least 30 such procedures in the last one year. “But we need a lot more trained hands on board,” he added.
