: I am a 24-year-old boy, and I am very confused about my sexuality. I am sexually attracted to both the sexes. In fact, if I become friends with transgender, and discover we have same hobbies, and likings- I get sexually attracted to them too. Please guide me on how to solve this - 
 

 
 : Issues related to sexual attractions can’t be answered based on a yes or no questionnaire. Some people are attracted towards same sex, while most are attracted to opposite sex, and again some maybe having a sexual attraction involving both sexes, which is known as “bisexuality”. 
 
 All these are classified as Gender Identity Disorders but may not require any treatment as long the person involved is comfortable with the sexuality. There is nothing wrong or right as long as you are comfortable and enjoy the relationship. You are not alone. 
 
 However, there is general hesitancy amongst people in discussing their sexuality in our country. Rather feel free to seek support of your family, friends or best to discuss with a mental health professional.
