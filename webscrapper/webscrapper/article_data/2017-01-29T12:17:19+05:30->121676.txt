 seems to have mentored his ' ' co-star, newbee   so well that superstar   now feels that he could learn something from her. Sanya, who plays   in the money-spinning 2016 release 'Dangal' recently shared a video on her Instagram page where she can be seen dancing to Shah Rukh's iconic song, Mitwa, from 'Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna'. The short clip is shot by 'Dangal' director Nitesh Tiwari and Sanya can be seen copying Shah Rukh's trademark arms-wide-open step in it. She posted the video with the caption, 'Mitwwaaaaaaa Shot by our very own human jib Mr @niteshtiwari22 and of course world-class editing by me ðŸ˜Ž #shootshenanigans #dangalthrowbak'. 

  
  
 The debutant's cute post caught Shah Rukh's attention. As this video of Sanya went viral on social media and a fan club shared it with Shah Rukh Khan, the superstar known for his easy wit was quick to respond with a message for Aamir Khan's on-screen daughter, '@sanyamalhotra07 will have to relearn from u. Fantastic.' 
 
 Shah Rukh clearly made Sanya's day, the young lady expressed her joy saying, 'Sir, mera toh Happy new year hogaya @iamsrk'
 
 This fun banter made Sanya's co-star   a tad jealous and she couldn't help but say, '@sanyamalhotra07 yeh dekh ne se pehle main Marr kyun nahi gaee. Sanya I am disowning you! # jealous ok. Bye.'
