 The Siolim MLA has said that the late night parties in his constituency are creating a problem for elderly citizens as well as the student community, which is in examination mode. 
 
 “Inspite of several warnings and reminders, late night music goes on till 4 am, which is creating problems not only for elderly citizens, but also to the student community, which is answering exams,” he said.
 
 The minister also complained that despite clear instructions, some people in Siolim are misusing his title to get away with the police and continue to hold  . 
 
 “The only obstruction is coming from some of the hoteliers as their business is impacted. I have given a final warning to the police now and would be meeting the chief minister on this matter,” he said, adding that “late night parties are not part of the Indian culture and thus, not to be encouraged”.
