HUBBALLIi: Union ministers H N   and Ramesh Jigajinagi criticised   while campaigning in Gadag and Dharwad districts on Tuesday. Kumar challenged chief minister Siddaramaiah to prove his allegation that   chief Amit Shah and JD(S) state president H D   travelled in the same aircraft or resign.

 Kumar told reporters in Gadag that Congress has struck an alliance with JD(S) to rule the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). 
 
 “If Siddaramaiah has morality, let him break the alliance with JD(S) in BBMP,” he challenged. The Union minister sought votes for Gadag BJP candidate Anil Menasinakai.
 
 Addressing a campaign at Soratur village, Kumar said, “Siddaramaiah’s government is a ‘Meter Baddi’ (meter interest) government while the next government of B S Yeddyurappa will be a zero percent interest government. While farmers were killed at Soratur a few years ago, Congress leaders have not visited the village so far,” he said.
 
 Jigajinagi told reporters in Hubballi that Congress leaders would hang themselves enmass if the injustice meted out to Dalits by Congress is listed out. 
 
 “Congress leaders are spreading rumours that the BJP is trying to remove reservation to seek Dalit votes. Congress is depicting Dalits as stupid. BJP is running the government based on the principles of Dr B R Ambedkar. If the Centre removes reservation, I will not be in the government. However, the fact is that the BJP government is working for the welfare of Dalits,” he said.
 
 Rebellion out in the open
 
 The differences in the BJP broke out in the presence of Union minister Ramesh Jigajinagi at Indira Nagar in Hubballi on Tuesday when former MLA Veerabhadrappa Halaharvi openly criticised the party leadership for denying him a ticket from Hubballi-Dharwad East, thereby continuing injustice to Madiga (left) community.
