VADODARA: A resident of   allegedly cheated his brother by giving the latter’s house as security to a woman from whom he had borrowed Rs four lakh in March this year.

 The accused Mehboobmiya Saiyed approached the complainant Jainabbanu Butt on March 8 through a common acquaintance Imran. Saiyed asked for Rs four lakh from Butt as he had to repay a person from south India from whom he had earlier borrowed the money.
 
 Butt agreed to give him money with condition that Saiyed will have to give a property as security. Saiyed told her he owns an apartment in Tandalja and mortgaged it to Butt by signing documents. After some months, Butt learnt that the house is owned by Saiyed’s brother   and wife Asmabanu.
 
 Police said that the couple told Butt that Saiyed had made a fake sale deed of the apartment in his name and gave it as security to her. Butt then asked Imran to inform Saiyed to return her the money which she had lent. Butt told the cops in her complaint that Imran kept dilly dallying and couple of days back refused to return the money.
