VARANASI: Mayor   has made   and   mandatory at the house meetings of   (VMC). A directive in this regard was issued to municipal commissioner to ensure its compliance. 

 The move came two days after a BJP corporator proposed singing of Jana Gana Mana and   before the house meetings. Corporator Ajay Gupta had put forth the proposal at a meeting on April 1. The mayor said that action would be initiated against SP and Congress members for allegedly insulting the national anthem and song and raising derogatory slogans. The mayor also mentioned that singing Vande Mataram in the house was a tradition in the past.
 
 Meanwhile, Congress members have expressed concerns. "Our national song is not a political debate. It has been an inseparable part of our functions post-independence and is sung before every programme. It is surprising that people who never sung it now want it to be incorporated in house proceedings. However, our only request is those singing be aware of the discipline required and do not insult it," said state spokesman of Congress, Prof. Satish Rai.
 
 District Congress president Prajanath Sharma said a workshop on the national song will be held in Maidagin on April 6 where a refresher course on its history, importance and discipline will be shared.
