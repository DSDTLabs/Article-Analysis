BELAGAVI: Even as there are rumours that MLA   is on the verge of leaving the  , his strategy against the party on Saturday in the elections of the   ( ) lent credence to it.

 The former minister played his cards well against the Congress in elections to the post of president and vice-president. He shocked the Congress by electing the candidates, who he supported, by joining hands with the BJP and some divided members of the   (MES).   member Ningappa Jadhav was elected president and BJP’s Renuka Patil vice-president to the APMC, both defeating the Congress’ official candidates. Congress had fielded senior leader Yuvaraj Kadam for president and Sudhir Gadde for vice-president. 
 
 Candidates supported by Satish Jarkiholi and the Congress got seven votes for the president’s post, which was later elected through the lottery system, in which Satish-supported Ningappa Jadhav emerged victorious. MES fielded Tanaji Patil for president but got just three votes. As the MES decided to remain neutral in this election, Satish Jarkiholi-supported candidate Renuka Patil won comfortably against Sudhir Gadde of Congress. 
 
 The failure to retainingg power in the APMC was a setback to district in-charge minister Ramesh Jarkiholi and KPCC Women Morcha president Laxmi Hebbalkar. Although Satish Jarkiholi clarified that he was not leaving the party, his strategy against it makes the talk more credible. Jarkiholi had been dropped from the cabinet few months ago and his elder brother Ramesh Jarkiholi was inducted.
