PANAJI: At least three Goan non-government organizations ( ) could lose their licence to receive   funding with the home ministry issuing showcause notices to them for not filing annual income and expenditure records for five consecutive years since 2010-11, director for foreign contribution at the Union ministry of home affairs, Santosh Sharma, said on Monday.

 Goa Football Association, Goa Heritage Action Group and Goa Animal Welfare Trust were among nearly 6,000 NGOs who received showcause notices on July 8. The NGOs have been given time till July 23 to respond.
 
 These NGOs were registered under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, or  , that allows them to receive foreign donations.
 
 “We have decided to let it (licence) lapse due to the strict compliance measures. Besides, we have no intention of pursuing or raising any foreign funding,” secretary of Goa Heritage Action Group (GHAG), Raya Shankwalkar said.
 
 “In spite of sufficient and adequate notice, it has been observed that 5,922 associations have not uploaded their annual returns for three or more than three years within the stipulated time given in the notice,” a Union ministry of home affairs circular said.
 
 The NGOs have to respond by July23, failing which it will be presumed that “they have nothing to say and action as proposed will be taken by the home ministry as per FCRA”, the circular said.
 
 Goa Football Association (GFA) said they had not received any showcause notice or letter asking them to submit details or returns. “GFA has not received any letters from the Union ministry lately. And we have not received any foreign contribution,” GFA secretary   said.
