PATNA: The state government on Wednesday demanded from Centre 100% power availability of its allotment of 2,942MW from central allocation as only 2100-2200MW was being made available to  .

 State energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav also urged the Centre to end the system of different rates charged by National Thermal Power Corporation ( ) in order to end regional disparity. He raised these issues on the first day of the two-day state power ministers’ conference in Delhi on Wednesday. 
 
 Reiterating the government’s commitment to supplying round-the-clock power to every household in the state, he said, “We are putting efforts to achieve the goal of 24X7 power availability. But to make this possible, we need 100% supply of power allotment to the state. The state has an allotment of 2942MW of central allocation, out of which the actual power availability is about 2100-2200MW. It was requested to allocate additional power at cheaper rates from central sector generating units of other regions to meet the requirement.” 
 
 He also claimed the state’s commitment was also visible from the fact that per capita energy consumption in Bihar in the last few years had witnessed steady increase from 120 units in 2012-13 to 310 units (provisional) in 2016-17.
 
 Yadav also strongly advocated the issue of different rates of power charged by the NTPC in the country. “This regional disparity should be done away with in the form of a National Tariff Policy for NTPC. It will also facilitate the survival of upcoming new generating units,” he added. 
 
 On the issue of coal linkage for 2X110 MW provided to   (BTPS) from  , he said, “The coal from ECL is costly and is of higher grade than the grade of coal technically required. We request for shifting of coal linkage from ECL to CCL,” said the minister. 
 
 He requested for swapping 1.10 MT coal for BTPS from ECL to CCL mines.
