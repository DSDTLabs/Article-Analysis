Gurgaon: The state forest department on Monday released a report by HARSAC (  Space Application Centre) on its website, highlighting a four-fold increase in   in the Aravalis during 1990s. 

 The report, including satellite images, was made public at a time when the department is planning an audit of plantation drives in the Aravalis in the last 26 years. The HARSAC report suggests forest cover across seven districts — Gurgaon, Bhiwani, Faridabad, Rewari, Nuh, Palwal and Mahendergarh — had shot up to 42,000 hectares in 1997 from around 10,000 hectares in 1990. Apart from the state government, European Union had also allocated a huge grant (Rs 175 crore) for the Aravali Project, which boosted greenery in the 1990s, before forest cover declined in the past decade.
 
 According to the report, in Gurgaon alone, forest cover had increased from 1,302 to 3,981 hectares — a rise in 2,679 hectares — during the period. While dense forests rose from 430 to 2,286 hectares, open forests rose to 1,295 hectares from 872. 
 
 “The Aravali Project has helped increase green cover in the seven districts. We’re now working on eco-restoration of the area, to allow natural vegetation,” said M D Sinha, forest conservator (Gurgaon circle).
 
 Regarding the fall in forest cover after 2000, former conservator   said, “The overall forest cover declined sharply across Haryana due to destruction of strip green areas for so-called infrastructure development. In south Haryana districts under the project, mining, construction and felling has hurt environment.”
