LUCKNOW: The city has a temple of   Dev, an incarnation of Lord Shiva, revered by Gujaratis and members of the community settled here perform the ritual Garba dance here during   every year. Located in the Shivpuri residential colony, the temple was built in 1940 by some   families who had settled in Lucknow.

 The temple’s president Raj Shekhar told TOI, “During Navaratra, when we organise the Garba Raas on Ashtami or Navami, this place looks like a mini Gujarat. The puja rituals are performed, with a ‘garba’ (earthen pot) in the centre and every one dances around it to the tunes of Gujarati folk and religious songs. It is the most awaited event of the year for the community settled in Lucknow.” Another community member   said, “Navaratra is not complete without Garba at the Hatkeshwar Mandir, where all young and old Gujaratis gather to perform the ritual.”
 
 The temple’s former president Ram Vyas said the temple was built by only three people. “Founder of Parag dairy in the city, Gopal Lal Pandya, along with his friends Durga Shankar Nagar and   thought of constructing a temple for Gujaratis in the city in 1935 and it took them five years to collect funds and select a piece of land for it. He brought all Gujratis in the city together and they helped him construct the temple. Pandya was also given the ‘Rai Bahadur’ title by the British government for his service to the society,” he said.
