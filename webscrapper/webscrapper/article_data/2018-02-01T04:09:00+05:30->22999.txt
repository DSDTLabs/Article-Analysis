Vadodara: The standing committee of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) rejected the hikes proposed by the administration in property tax in the draft budget for the year 2018-19. The panel also tempered down the hikes in sanitation charges and fees for other services.

 The administrationâ€™s proposals of hikes in property tax and sanitation charges would have led to an increased revenue of Rs 80.20crore, but the striking down of hikes in property tax and changes in the slabs of sanitation charges would now lead to additional revenue of Rs 21.44crore.
 
 The cleanliness charges by the civic body have also been raised for both residential and non-residential units. Residential units up to 50 square meter area will have to pay Rs 250 per annum while those between 50 square meters and 100 square meters will have to pay Rs 500 per annum towards sanitation or cleanliness charges. 
 
 Residential properties above 100 square meters will have pay Rs 750 per annum towards sanitation.
 
 Non-residential units up to a size of 50 square meters will have to pay Rs 1,000 or 10 per cent of their general property tax, whichever is higher. The rate for non-residential properties between 50 square meters and 100 square meters has been fixed at Rs 1,800 or 10 per cent of general property tax, whichever is higher. For non-residential properties above the size of 100 square meters, the charges will be Rs 2,500 or 10 per cent of the general property tax.
 
 With the changes the budget size of the civic body went down to Rs 3,728crore from Rs 3,820crore. VMC standing committee chairperson Dr Jigisha Sheth said that the costs that the VMC charged for various services were lowered significantly. 
 
 Sheth added that a series of steps were also being taken to cut costs. The committee did not add any new major development works even as works proposed by the administration were largely retained.
 
 Discussions on the budget will now be taken up by the general board of the civic body.
