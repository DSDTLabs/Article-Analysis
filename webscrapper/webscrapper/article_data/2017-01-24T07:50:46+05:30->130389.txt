HYDERABAD:   (TPCC) president   said in the current political atmosphere in the state, there is a need for all forces seeking to hold the government accountable to become stronger.The Congress, for its part, will always support any organisation that seeks to hold the TRS government accountable on its promises to the people of the state, Uttam Kumar Reddy said while chatting with reporters here on Monday .

 This was the reason why the   state secretary  's march across the state. Veerabhadram has been on a pada yatra for the past couple of weeks highlighting the unfulfilled promises of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi government. “I will join him during his pada yatra in Nalgonda district,“ Uttam said.
 
 He said chairman of the   (TJAC) M Kodandaram, a staunch critic of the KCR government, was unlikely to launch a new political party.
 
 The state Congress will invite party vice-president Rahul Gandhi soon to address a meeting of students at Osmania University . He said the TRS government had cheated students on several fronts and that the Congress will stand by them.
 
 The Congress leader's comments on Kodandaram came in the wake of the TJAC chairman's remarks that despite undertaking a 3000-km trip across the state with many stops, he was unable to reach out to a large number of people.
 
 Kodandaram, on Sunday , also said that taking the social media route to spread the word about taking action against the government's inaction on keeping its promises would likely be more effective.
 
 He said huge protests in Tamil Nadu in support of Jallikattu picked up because of communication among youth on social media platforms and within a short period of time, the result was there for all to see.
 
 “We should take the Jallikattu protests as the model for the rally by the unemployed in Hyderabad in the third week of February ,“ Kodandaram said.
