VADODARA: A moneylender, who is on the run after he was booked for abetting the suicide of civil contractor  , has filed for anticipatory bail in the sessions court here.

 Accused Dilipsinh Chauhan was named as one of the 12 accused in the complaint filed by Thakkar’s wife Hina. Chauhan had filed his bail application on Monday pleading innocence in the case. The first hearing was held on Wednesday and now the court will again hear the application on Friday. Police are expected to oppose the bail application by filing an affidavit. 
 
 According to police complaint, Chauhan had lent money to Thakkar so that he could continue his construction work at different sites. Hina had alleged that Chauhan had come to their house a couple of months ago and threatened her husband. He had also taken away Thakkar’s new car on that day.
 
 Last week, Nilesh Gandhi, director of city-based  , had also applied for anticipatory bail which was granted by the court on Tuesday. Thakkar had taken up Gandhi’s work at MS University’s polytechnic college for which he had to be paid Rs71 lakh.
 
 Besides Chauhan and Gandhi, nine other builders have been booked by police for non-payment of dues to Thakkar which led him to take the extreme step of killing himself.
