MUMBAI: The state recorded 2,917   suicides in 2017. According to revenue department figures, 1,753 of these cases, which account for 60% of the total, were recorded after the loan   was announced in June.

 Despite the waiver, the number of suicides fell just 4.4% over the previous year. In 2016, the state saw 3,052 suicides.
 
 Yet, one region in the state saw a rise in cases. The sugar belt of Western Maharashtra reported 102 cases in 2017 compared to 75 in 2016, a rise of 36%.
 
 The   region, from where chief minister   hails, continued to report the highest number of cases. The region reported 1,344 farmer suicides in 2017, just 7% lower than the previous year. The five districts of the Amravati division saw a decline of only 20 cases since last year while the Nagpur division recorded a decline of 80 cases.
 
 By the end of 2017, cotton farmers from Vidarbha and Marathwada had to contend with a massive pest attack of the pink bollworm. Vidarbha also faced another form of distress -- as many as 51 farm labourers died after the use of toxic pesticides in spraying operations. However, these figures are collated separately.
 
 Arid Marathwada reported 991 suicides in 2017, which was 5.8% lower than the previous year. North Maharashtra recorded 475 cases, almost on par with the 479 cases recorded in 2016. Konkan recorded five suicides in 2017, while in 2016 not a single case was reported.
 
 The government maintains the   waiver will not bring down the number of farmer suicides and the solution is increasing investment in agriculture. The roll-out process was delayed initially owing to the lengthy verification process.
 
 Farm activists point to inefficient delivery of the loan waiver. “There were so many eligibility criteria for the loan waiver that a large number of debt-ridden farmers were excluded and have been unable to benefit from it,” says Ajit Navale from the Kisan Sabha.
 
 “In some cases, money for the loan waiver has reached the banks, but farmers are yet to receive fresh crop loans,” points out farm activist Vijay Jawandhia. He points out that crop pricing is yet to improve without which indebtedness will continue in the farm sector. “Cotton prices are currently at Rs 5,200 per quintal, down from around 5,700 per quintal at this time last year,” he pointed out.
