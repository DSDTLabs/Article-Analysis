COIMBATORE: Even as the mystery of a security guard's death at  's   in the Nilgiris remains solved,  , a prime suspect died on Friday in a car accident. 

 What has raised eyebrows is that a second accident took place in neighboring Kerala on Saturday, grievously injuring another suspect who was a close associate of Kanagaraj's. This associate is called Sayan alias Shyam. His wife Vinupriya and daughter Neethu died in the alleged accident.
 
 Kanagaraj was Jayalalithaa's driver until 2012. He was the prime suspect in the murder at Kodanad tea estate. 
 
 He died in an accident at Attur in Salem district on Friday night when a speeding car rammed into a bike, killing the biker on the spot. Attur police sent the body to the Attur Government Hospital for a postmortem. 
 
 The police soon realised that the man who died was Kanagaraj.
 
 They registered a case under Section 279 (rash driving) and 304 (cause death by negligence) of IPC and detained the car driver for investigation.
 
 Kanagaraj's associate Sayan, a native of Thrissur, was working in a bakery at Kuniyamuthur in Coimbatore. He was staying in a rental house here and was a close friend of Kanagaraj's. 
 
 On Saturday around 4 am, he was heading to Thrissur from Coimbatore in a car along with his family. When the car reached Kannadi, a place on the Palakkad-Thrissur Road, it rammed into a stationary container truck. 
 
 On the night of April 24, a Nepali guard Om Bahadur, who worked at Jayalalithaa's Kodanad tea estate in the Nilgiris, was killed when a gang entered the estate premises in two SUVs. Another guard Shyam Bahadur was left seriously injured and the gang fled after smashing open some windows. 
 
 Police have reportedly detained five persons in connection with the incident. Kanagaraj was also said to be wanted by the police in connection with the armed intrusion.
