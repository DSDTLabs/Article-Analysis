 Back in the Bharadwaj house, Simar and Roshni begin to look for Piyush. They ask Aarav and Amar about him. But they are totally clueless. When everyone finds Simar too worried, they nudge her to tell them the reason. Simar finally reveals that Piyush has turned into kaal, a monster. 
 
 
  
 She also goes on to tell everyone how Ridhima and her sister Ananya are the reason behind the magical powers. They are all stunned to know this. Pari is relieved that she broke all ties with them. Suddenly Roshni finds Radha weeping in a corner and asks her the reason. She says that she saw Piyush as a monster. Simar gets worried about the well-being of her son as Khushi taunts her.
