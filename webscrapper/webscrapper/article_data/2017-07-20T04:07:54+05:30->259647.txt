Mumbai:   has decided to depute Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel on   after thefts were reported on the superfast train that reached Mumbai on Tuesday.

 WR chief public relations officer Ravinder Bhakar said, “We have deputed a seven-member team to keep a check on such activity.”
 
 Five passengers found their bags and cellphones missing during their overnight journey from Delhi on Monday. A passenger, Sayyed Hamid Ali, lost his belongings worth Rs 1.93 lakh. However, a few passengers were not keen on registering an FIR because the ‘loss was negligible’.
 
 A senior RPF official said, “We will provide   for the journey between Mumbai Central and Nagda Junction in Madhya Pradesh and back.” 
 
 After an FIR was registered at Mumbai Central, the Government Railway Police in Baroda initiated probe as the location of complainant’s stolen cellphone was traced near Halol in Gujarat.
