AHMEDABAD: Albert Einsteinâ€™s explanation of   laid the foundation of quantum theory, which explains the nature and behaviour of matter and energy on atomic and sub-atomic scales. 

 Throwing more light on the latest research in the field will be Prof P C Deshmukh of   at the PRL on February 7. 
 
 His lecture will explain how in the last decade, there have been pioneering studies, both experimental and theoretical, in which photoionization time-delays on the attosecond time scale have been reported. 
 
 According to Deshmukh, such advancements are of importance for the atomic-clock technology, and to understand fundamental relativistic effects and many-body electron-correlations in atomic dynamics. 
 
 This research field is very young, yet quite vast. 
 
 The talk will provide a brief introduction to this exciting field and discuss our understanding of the
