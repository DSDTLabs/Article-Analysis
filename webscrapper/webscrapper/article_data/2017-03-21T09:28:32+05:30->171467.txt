GUWAHATI: Tension erupted in   (GU) on Monday after college students, led by the Satra Mukti Sangram Samiti (SMSS), blocked the entrance to the university demanding reforms in the semester system in the undergraduate colleges affiliated to GU. 

 Students continued to gherao the administrative building of the university demanding solution of their grievances as the indefinite hunger strike by the SMSS, the student wing of the peasant organization Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti, was called off on the seventh day. Six students have been hospitalized after they fell ill during the fast that began on the GU campus last Tuesday.
 
 "  should allow students who have   or   in the second semester to appear in the  . This is our prime demand. Students should not lose time in the name of the semester system," said Aminul Haque, SMSS education secretary.
 
 Four fasting students, who fell ill on the second day of the fast were advised hospitalization, but they refused hospitalization unless their demands are met.
