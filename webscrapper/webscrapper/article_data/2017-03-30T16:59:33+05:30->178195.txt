 has been living it up in her favourite city ­London ­with friends and family. The 31-year-old actress, who took off to the Queen's City on March 23 to ring in mother Sunita's 60th birthday has been partying with sister Rhea, cousin Anshula, businessman-boyfriend Anand Ahuja and UK based designer friends, Tamara Ralph, Michael Russo and Anooshe Mussarat.

 And while the actress also caught up with her 'Veere Di Wedding' co-star 
  for lunch in London on Sunday (Bebo was vacationing with husband Saif Ali Khan), the two are not rolling with their   directed drama until June. Instead, Sonam is set to fly out to Indore to shoot with 
  for R Balki's 'Padman'. The film features 
  as Akshay's wife and details about Sonam's character have been kept under wraps. When contacted, Balki categorically dismissed rumours of Sonam playing the role of a journalist.
 
  
  
 The film, based on Arunachalam Muruganantham, the inventor of a low-cost sanitary pad-making machine in India, had kicked off with Akshay shooting solo in the   Capital last month.
 
 Akshay's wife, former actress and bestselling author  , who is making her production debut with the film, is also expected to be in the city. A large production unit has been at work in Maheshwar, a town in the Khargone district of Madhya Pradesh 90 km from Indore and home to one of India's oldest hand-loom fabric traditions.
 
 'Padman' is being shot at real locations, including the river-side temples, ghats, forts and palaces.
