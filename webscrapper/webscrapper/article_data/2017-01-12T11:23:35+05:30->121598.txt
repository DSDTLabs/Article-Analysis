AURANGABAD: Senior police officers from across the state expressed their confusion over the state government’s move to order transfers or allot postings and then make changes randomly.

 A government resolution suggests that the transfers should take place in May each year. However, the officials have expressed concern over the transfer orders being issued later in the year. At least 58 transfer orders have been issued in the state since 2016, officials said. 
 
 Earlier, all the transfers were carried out in the state in two to three orders for the entire force, they said. Senior police officers, who are in the city for the 29th   State Police Games, told TOI that they were concerned about the abrupt transfers and revisions to the orders. 
 
 An additional DG-rank officer told TOI that all the transfers, except in certain cases, were earlier carried out in two or maximum three instalments. “But if we go by the transfer orders issued by the home department since 2015, there have been so many cases wherein the posting was issued for only one officer, leaving all of us wondering about things happening behind the curtain,” he said. 
 
 A range   said that it was worrying trend and most had not challenged the orders fearing backlash from the state. An officer, who has been a victim of such unscheduled transfer, said that one day they get a transfer order and the following day, another order is issued saying that it has been put on hold and someone else has been posted there. 
 
 Maharashtra director general of police Satish Mathur said, “The decision about the transfers of IPS officers and the superintendents is taken by the state government and I cannot comment on them,” he said. 
 
 When asked, if the state does not consult him before taking a call on the transfers, he refused to comment.
