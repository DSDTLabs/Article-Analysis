NAGPUR: On Monday morning, a batch of about 60   inmates sat in groups with sheets of paper and pen in the jail premises. They were asked to write or draw what was in their heart.

 “I was a driver before I was arrested. I want to start driving again,” wrote one convict. “I wish to be a chef and run a dhaba,” wrote another. One not very cheerful looking inmate surprised volunteers when he wrote, “I am happy.” Some wrote about missing their family. They were part of a workshop held by   on  , for a batch of 60 inmates as part of their upliftment endeavour, ‘Ek Nayi Disha.’ 
 
 The workshop planned for one hour extended for over two, after which the volunteers tried to take feedback from a couple of inmates on what they felt. “One person said he felt less negative and more energetic,” said  , ‘first lady’ of the club.
 
 Speaking of the initiative, Jyoti said, “Once the inmates return to society, many will look down upon them and the convicts should be ready to forgive them. We want this project to work as a morale booster for them. Vocational training will encourage them to apply for and acquire jobs in order to live comfortably once they end their sentence.”
 
 Such workshops on different themes will be organized twice a week, informed Rotarian Pooja Khatri, a psychologist. “Last Saturday, we took a workshop with inmates on respecting each other and had asked them to draw their own self. Everyone was to comment on each other’s painting and they did well in complimenting each other. Some even wrote poems and made paintings,” she said.
 
 Members of Rotary including Bharti Dua were helped by a group ‘Enlightening your soul’ headed by  , along with friends Kanika Ghai and Shweta Kewalramani.
 
 “In collaboration with  , we will soon be setting up a computer lab and designing a certified computer course,” said  , president, Rotary Club of Nagpur North.
 
 Earlier, a beauty course for female inmates was also conducted by the club.
