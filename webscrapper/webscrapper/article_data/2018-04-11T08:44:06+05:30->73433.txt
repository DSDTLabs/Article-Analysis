CHENNAI: In a boost to private medical colleges, the Medical Council of India’s amendments now allow non-governmental medical colleges and institutions to fill up 50% of their seats on the basis of the merit list prepared as per the marks obtained in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), after surrendering 50% to the state.

  through counselling will be done by the state-appointed committee for government colleges. Self-financing colleges affiliated to the state university will admit students through single window counselling after surrendering 50% seats to the all-India quota. 
 
 “Until last year, all the admissions were made by the state authority. The seats were returned only when they could not be filled up after counselling,” said Dr  , general secretary, Doctors’ Association for Social Equality. “While this is unfair, what is likely to delay the admission process in our state is the inclusion of incentives for in-service candidates working in rural areas,” he said.
 
 While clearing the NEET will continue to be mandatory for admissions, the notification says in-service candidates may be given an incentive of up to 10% of their marks in the examination for each year of service in remote and/or difficult areas or rural areas up to a maximum of 30% of their marks. The remote and/or difficult areas or rural areas shall be as notified by the state or competent authority from time to time, it said. 
 
 “Based on recommendations from the six-member committee, the state released a notification for classification of districts. But rural areas are not included. It may have to be reworked,” said Ravindranath.
