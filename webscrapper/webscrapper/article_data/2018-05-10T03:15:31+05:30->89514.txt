AGRA: As many as 146 people died in accidents on   Expressway in 2017, highest since the six-lane freeway was inaugurated in August 2012. In its response to an RTI query, private concessioner Jaypee Infratech Limited said that the total number of deaths (from August-December) was 6% higher than the 133 casualties that were reported during the same period in 2016.

 With the introduction of a host of safety measures such as impact attenuators, bull nose barriers near the entry and exit points and rumble strips to alert drowsy drivers, in 2017, the 165-km-long expressway reported 763 accidents, lowest in last four years. However, this did not have an impact on the number of people injured as 1,426 persons (second highest since August 2012) were hurt in crashes and collisions on the expressway last year.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Santosh Pawar, head of operations at Yamuna Expressway, said, “Through our sustained efforts, we have been able to reduce the number of accidents on the expressway. In 2016, 1,219 accidents were reported, while last year the number came down to 763. Though the total casualties were higher than previous years, the main reason behind that was overcrowding of vehicles. We witnessed a number of accidents in which people were travelling in large groups. That too may have contributed to the high  .”
 
 Contrary to Pawar’s claim, Agra-based Shiv Chauhan, who had rescued a Ukrainian woman from the e-way in December 2017, said, “Two other Ukrainian women were killed in that accident because the expressway rescue team did not reach on time. I took all three of them in my car, but managed to save only one of them.”
 
 According to the private concessioner operating Yamuna Expressway, there are five ambulances on three toll plazas and 17 patrolling vehicles, including six which are operated by local police. “We have improved our response time and try to provide relief to accident victim as soon as possible,” said Pawar.
