MUMBAI : Three weeks after the matter was hotly discussed in the legislative assembly, the state government has directed the   to suspend assistant municipal commissioner of C ward and other civic officials who failed to take action against an unauthorized ninestorey building in south Mumbai’s congested   area.

 In a letter to the BMC commissioner on April 16, a copy of which is with the TOI, the government has sought clarity on why no action was taken against the illegal building on   though a notice was served under Section 354 A of the   Act, 1888.
 
 As per Section 354 A of the Act, if the commissioner is satisfied that work on any building has unlawfully commenced or work is being unlawfully carried out on a premises, the commissioner can issue a notice to stop work.
 
 The state government order has also directed the BMC to suspend the assistant municipal commissioner concerned and other officials responsible for not initiating action. Surprisingly, it does not mention the name of the official in charge of the ward. It is rare for an assistant municipal commissioner to face such action over an illegal building.
 
 A senior civic official, meanwhile, said no action has been initiated against the building yet. The government, however, has called for immediate action and sought a report in seven days.
 
 Municipal commissioner   said they had received orders from the state government and the same would be followed.
 
  activist Anil Galgali said this would set a good example as the responsibility of a ward officer will automatically increase from now on. “Officers will become more cautious as this directive indicates illegal constructions will not be tolerated,” he said.
