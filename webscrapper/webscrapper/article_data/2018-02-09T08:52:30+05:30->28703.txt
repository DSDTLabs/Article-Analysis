 The protesters threatened to continue agitation unless the committee was dissolved. They alleged that officials and policemen were charging devotees coming to the temple in the name of providing services and defaming the world-renowned holy site of Pushkar.
 
 Later, sub-divisional officer   reached the spot and tried to convince the protesters.   stated that the rights of all priests would be protected and they would not be deprive of any facility. Following the assurance of Mathur, the priests went back to work.
 
 Priests constitute a significant segment of local people in Pushkar. They are well versed in various languages and cater to a large number of foreign tourists who come daily to offer prayers at the temple.
