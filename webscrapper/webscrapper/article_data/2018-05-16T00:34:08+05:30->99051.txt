 CITY: Israel faced a growing backlash on Tuesday and new charges of using excessive force, a day after Israeli troops firing from across a border fence killed 59 Palestinians and wounded more than 2,700 at a mass protest in Gaza.

 
 Turkey expelled Israel's ambassador, while Ireland and Belgium summoned Israeli envoys. Leading European countries and the   human rights office called for an investigation of the bloodshed, and the   held a moment of silence for the Palestinians killed on Monday as it opened discussions on the Gaza situation.
 
 Israel says it has the right to defend its border against a possible mass breach and accuses Gaza's Hamas rulers of trying to carry out attacks under the cover of the protests. A military spokesman said on Tuesday that 14 of those killed a day earlier were involved in attacks.

 In jarring contrast to the Gaza bloodshed, the US held a festive inauguration ceremony for a new   in contested Jerusalem at the same time Monday. The juxtaposition of violence on the Gaza border and festivities attended by a Trump administration delegation - captured on split screens in TV broadcasts around the world - briefly drew attention to the plight of Gaza and its 2 million people. Germany, Belgium and Ireland called for an investigation of the violence.
