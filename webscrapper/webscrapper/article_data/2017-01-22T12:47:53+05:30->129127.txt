RANCHI: Former Union minister   on Thursday said that the opposition in the assembly should bring a privilege motion against chief minister  , if he did not apologize for the usage of unparliamentary words like goondas in the assembly on Friday. Das had said, “Yahan gunda gardi nahi chalegi,” after the suspension of four opposition MLAs on Thursday.

 “Das’s comment is unlike anything I have ever heard in my political career, be it my term in the   or the Bihar assembly, where the most inappropriate things have been said before. The opposition should bring a privilege motion against the CM if he does not apologize for his statements publicly.” Sahay was speaking to mediapersons on Saturday.
 
 “The speaker has taken only a month to suspend the MLAs after recommendations of the ethics committee but why has no action been taken against the six JVM MLAs who had defected to the BJP more than 2 years ago,” asked Sahay.
 
  He also addressed the issue of demonetisation saying, “It is difficult to say who is more dictatorial these days, the CM or the PM. While one has forced a disastrous demonetisation on us, the other is forcing an inhuman CNT SPT act down our throat. The amendments will rob tribals of their property.”
 
  Sahay went on to accuse Raghubar Das of having filed false cases against former Congress members Yogender Sao and his MLA wife Nirmala Devi after the Barkagaon incident, in which four people had been killed. 
 
 “They did not even spare their poor son whom they arrested while he was on a vacation.”
