MUMBAI: Students enrolled in private schools under provisions of the Right to Education Act, 2009, will get around Rs 2,000 more as annual reimbursement. 

 The state government has hiked the per annum reimbursement. As per a government resolution issued by the education department, private schools will now receive up to Rs 17,670 per year for every student from economically weaker section - a hike of almost Rs 2,000. The amount was Rs 13,474 in the 2014-15 academic year.
 
 All unaided non-minority schools in the city are expected to reserve 25% of their seats at entry level for students from economically weaker sections. The state reimburses the school for the student who studies there for free. 
 
 The schools will be paid Rs 17,670 or the actual spending on the student, whichever is lower. 
 
 Each year, approximately 3.000 students get admission in private schools through a lottery conducted by the civic body.
 
 While schools have welcomed the hike in payout but have also demanded to know how the government arrived at the new amount. 
 
 "We have tried to ask the government how the amount is being decided but in vain. For many schools, the amount is not enough," said S C  , secretary of the Unaided Schools  . 
 
 School managements are also unhappy about the disbursement of the reimbursement. Earlier in December, the unaided schools associations from   had threatened to not admit   students during the next academic year if the reimbursements were not given to them before December 31. 
 
 Kedia said, "The reimbursements have started but most are still pending. There is no deadline and schools are being threatened to not follow up. " 
 
 School associations are expected to meet on January 5 to take a final call to admit students or not next year. School education secretary,   said, "All approvals are in place."
