PUNE: Bengalis all over the world will on Saturday welcome the new lunar year with the advent of Poila Baisakh, the first day of the year 1424.

 Poila Baisakh celebrations in West Bengal are generally marked by shopping sprees, cultural programmes, traditional meals, and family get-togethers. Bengalis in the city have prepared for the festival on similar lines.
 
 Almost all groups have lined up cultural events for tomorrow. However, according to organisers, attendance may be lower than usual as school-breaks have led many to holidays.
 
 “Our larger cultural events are held during Durga Puja but during Poila Baisakh we let community members display their talent in recitation, dance, and music. This will be followed by a sumptuous Bengali dinner,” said Somdutta Sengupta, of the Bengali Association based near Range Hills.
 
 Across town, in Kalyaninagar, preparations were being made for the  . “We are organising a small cultural meet of music, poetry, and dance events on Saturday,” said a member of the cultural group Nandanik.
 
 Bengali business owners also close their account books for the previous year and open a new one, in a practice known as haalkhaata, after having the new book blessed by goddess Kali. “I may be thousands of kilometres away from my home but I still practice haalkhaata every year. I make it a point to settle the debts of the year gone by, make the final settlements of last year’s books, and open a new one with Kali’s blessings,” beamed Asit Patra, a tailor based in Chandannagar.
 
 Also coinciding with Poila Baisakh festivities is Rongali Bihu, the Assamese New Year that occurs on April 14, 15, and 16. “We are celebrating Bohag Bihu with programmes of Assamese music and dance in various parts of the city, not to mention families cooking the traditional dishes,” said a member of the community, who works with an infotech firm in the city.
