GUWAHATI: Former chief minister  , during whose tenure the process of updating the   was started, claimed on Thursday that he is the architect of the exercise to list the names of bona fide Indian citizens living in the state but that he is unhappy with the way the process is being handled. 

 "I am not happy because I gave birth to the whole process and neither Aasu nor (Prafulla) Mahanta nor Sarbananda (Sonowal) wanted the NRC to be updated. Even the Assam Accord does not speak about this process," Gogoi said.
 
 Gogoi said the reason for his unhappiness is that names of MLAs and MPs, whose names feature on electoral rolls and who have been found by the EC to be eligible to contest elections, do not figure in the first draft of the NRC that was published on December 31. 
 
 "In Muslim and Bengali-speaking dominated areas, which have been marked as sensitive areas, the verification should have done with utmost care. The government deployed security forces in these areas but because the verification was not done properly there is so little coverage in these areas," Gogoi said.
 
 He added, "Even the name of my daughter who lives in the US has been included but the MLAs and MPs of the state have not found place."
 
 AASU adviser   challenged Gogoi to prove that the students' body has been against the updating of the NRC. "He was the chief minister for 15 years and he knows how we have been involved," Bhattacharya said. Mahanta was unavailable for comment while there was no statement from the chief minister's office on this.
 
 The white paper on the foreignerss issue published by previous Congress government in 2012 shows that Mahanta had first raised the NRC updating issue in 1980 as then president of AASU in a letter to then prime Minister  .
