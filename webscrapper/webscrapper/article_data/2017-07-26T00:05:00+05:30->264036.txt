Riingo is on cloud nine. His film,  , will now be made in   and Hindi. The director will be in Mumbai next week to finalise the cast. “The biggest production company in the south approached us to remake the film in Tamil and   and we have signed on the dotted line. At a time when we remake south films, it feels great they want to remake our films. They want me to direct both the films. The Hindi version will be shot in Kolkata. We have not yet decided on the shooting location of the Tamil film. I will suggest names of some actors from   who could be part of the Hindi project and then it is upto them to finalise,” said Riingo. He added, “An airline company has also bought the rights of the film and it will be shown on flights too. So, the film has been appreciated nationally.”
But the film didn’t do well at the box office here, we tell him. “The film should have done well, I really don’t know what went wrong 
 here. But I am happy it could make a mark nationally,” said the director.
