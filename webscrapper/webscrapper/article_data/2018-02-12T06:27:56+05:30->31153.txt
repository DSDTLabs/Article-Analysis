Kolkata: A 57-year-old man was arrested for allegedly clicking "objectionable" pictures of a Class XI student while she was travelling in a Garia-Tollygunge route auto with her mother. The suspect has been identified as Sachidananda Chaudhury. 

 "I had seen him operating his mobile with the flip cover guarding the screen. Initially, I thought he needed some privacy. Later when he kept the phone on his thigh, I felt that he was clicking my pictures. The lens of the camera was pointed towards me," said the 17-year-old girl.
 
 After a while when Chaudhury again tried to click her photos, the girl - a student of a south Kolkata school - challenged him. He then allegedly deleted some pictures. The girl then snatched the mobile and found some of her "objectionable photos" in the gallery. They asked the auto driver to stop in front of a traffic beat and reported the matter to the officer on duty. Chaudhury was later arrested and slapped with charges under sections 12 Pocso Act and 354 IPC (sexual harassment). tnn
