NOIDA: The   in the city, who are in a panic mode following a sudden clampdown by   in the wake of state government orders, are now applying with the district administration for registration certificates. 

 TOI reported on Sunday that according to Noida Authority’s department of public health, no licence had been granted to any meat shop under its jurisdiction. They had issued licence to only one slaughterhouse and one meat processing unit in Greater Noida, suggesting that over a thousand shops and outlets are illegal. Interestingly, several meat shop owners were found to have a registration certificate from the district department following a reality check.
 
 However, the administration is now allowing these shopkeepers to get a certificate by applying under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. 
 
 After the Authority carried out demolitions in Sector 62 and removed meat shops in several parts of the city including Sector 5 and Sector 44 in last few days, meat sellers are running from pillar to post to understand the process of registration. “I have been running the shop for almost a year now. I never faced such a hassle before. However, on Friday, some police officers asked me if I had a license to run my shop. When I told them that I did not know about the requirement of any such certificate, they directed me to apply for one,” said Laqeef Ahmed, a chicken biryani shop owner in Sector 44.
 
 Another meat shop owner in Sector 46 said, “Several cops visited the Som Bazar on Wednesday and ordered shut down of the meat shops. Most of us are now in a fix..”
