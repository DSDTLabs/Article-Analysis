Kolkata: The sharp chill has forced several Kolkata schools to relax their stringent uniform norms. Long trousers, stockings and slacks, which are a strict no-no in most schools, are being allowed to help students beat the winter bite. Parents and students have warmly greeted the decision.

 Schools that have warmed up to a more covered attire include South Point, The Heritage School, Rammohan Mission and South City International School, among others. In South Point, students are now allowed to wear stockings to keep out the chill, said spokesperson Krishna Damani.
 
 Track pants instead of skirts are being allowed at The Heritage School. “Since the chill has coincided with our annual sports, we had to take measures to help the students be comfortable. It had become necessary to relax the uniform norm and it has helped,” said principal Seema Sapru. 
 
 At South City International, skin-colour leggings are being allowed from the primary section onwards. “This option is open to our girls,” said John Bagul, principal. 
 
 Dolna Day School hasn’t relaxed their uniform norms. But principal Madhura Bhattacharya said the school allows its ‘pre-school’ students to wear full pants or leggings that cover their legs. “The seniors from class I onwards are allowed to wear stockings but not trousers,” she said.
 
 The chill has forced Rammohan Mission School to allow girl students to wear stockings from nursery to class XII. “It’s chillier when classes begin in the morning so we have decided to let our girl students slip into stockings,” said principal Sujoy Biswas. At Dankuni, the Methodist School has decided to allow mufflers, gloves and woollen caps.
