BENGALURU: In a major relief to former Kerala chief minister  , a Bengaluru court on Wednesday set aside the   dated October 24, 2016, directing him to pay Rs 1.61 crore with interest to a city-based businessman who was allegedly cheated after being promised a   in Kerala.

 Additional City Civil and Sessions Court judge N R Channakeshava has noted that Chandy has shown sufficient cause in his application to set aside the earlier order as he did not get an opportunity of hearing. With this, the suit is reo pened and proceedings will be continued from June 1.
 
 Businessman Kuruvilla had alleged that Rs 1.35 crore was collected from him by a firm,  , in various instalments during 2011-12 to get licence and subsidy from the central and state governments for importing solar technology from South Korea. He claimed then CM Chandy spoke to him over phone on the matter.
 
 Chandy's counsel Joseph Anthony , who appeared in the court last year, had claimed that the suit was filed to defame the senior Congress leader. In his affidavit, Chandy had claimed that he was arrayed as a defendant `unnecessarily, mischievously and only with a fraudulent intent to defameâ€œ him though he had no connection with the alleged business transaction. He also claimed that he knew nothing about the other defendants with whom Kuruvila wanted to do business and that the latter mislead the court and obtained the ex-parte judgment.
