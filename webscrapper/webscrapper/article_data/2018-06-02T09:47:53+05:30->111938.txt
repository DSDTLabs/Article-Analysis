KOCHI: With efforts to find Lisy   (42), a woman who jumped off the second Goshree   on Thursday yielding no results, the   police have alerted other police stations in the area regarding the whereabouts about the woman.

 Mulavukadu police on Friday said that efforts were on to find the woman with the assistance of coastal police.
 
 “We were searching for   on Friday. However, we called off the search in the evening,” said  .
 
 The incident happened on Thursday morning . A woman who was passing-by on a two-wheeler saw the woman jumping off the bridge and alerted the police.
 
 The missing woman has been diabetic for years and was diagnosed with blood cancer a few months ago. Police are suspecting that this could be the reason that forced her to take the extreme step. The woman had called up her husband soon before jumping off the bridge.
 
 Her husband who got suspicious had approached the Central police after the call. Police officers along with the husband reached the bridge. Later, Sebastian identified the bag and mobile phone left at the bridge to confirm that it was Lisy who jumped off the bridge.
 
 Earlier in April,  , a 21-year-old woman, had jumped off the same bridge. She had committed suicide on her wedding day and was later found dead in the backwaters.
 
 Police had then suspected that she had copied the act of Mishel, a teenager found dead in the backwaters in March 2017.   was also suspected to have jumped off the second Goshree bridge.
 
 Though there were witnesses to identify Krishnapriya and Lisy, police had no solid witnesses to identify the victim as Mishel.
