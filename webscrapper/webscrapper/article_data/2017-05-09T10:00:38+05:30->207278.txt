HYDERABAD: A  's fairy-tale   ended on a tragic note. A day after the alleged   and sexual assault, in which TRS MLC R Bhupathi Reddy's son's role came to light, more murky details tumbled out on Monday.

 The 24-year-old victim, in her statement to police, alleged that prime accused   raped her at his   villa at Kompally and subsequently kept her 'captive' in a room by locking the door from outside. 
 
 After an hour, Pritam called his two friends -Snehith Reddy, the son of ruling TRS MLC Bhupathi Reddy, and Aarav Reddy -to his residence. And, more shockingly, the three together made a bid to sexually assault the victim. Cyberabad police said Pritam on Saturday called the victim, with whom he was in a relationship, to Palm Meadows to discuss about the beautician's plan to open a boutique and their proposed marriage plans. Pritam was mulling to finance the boutique.
 
 “After the victim reached Pritam's villa, he had sex with her and later locked her up in the room. About an hour later, Snehith Reddy and Aarav Reddy reached Pritam's villa. The victim claimed that Pritam asked her to have sex with his friends. However, the victim rejected his suggestion. After the trio tried to force themselves on her, she cried for help and tried to flee from the place. Later, the trio, fearing others might notice their deed, made her sit in their car and dropped her at Kompally,'' an officer associated with the investigation told TOI.
 
 Police are perplexed why the victim still choose to get into the car of the culprits.
 
 Police sources said about 45 days ago, the victim and Pritam first met at a function in Jubilee Hills. In a short span of time, they got into a relationship. “The victim claimed Snehith and Aarav were strangers to her. And, it was only after Pritam called them she saw the duo for the first time. Pritam's father is a contractor, while his two friends stay near Pritam's residence,'' the officials said.
