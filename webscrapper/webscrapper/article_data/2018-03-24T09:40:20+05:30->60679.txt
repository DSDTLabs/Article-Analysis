CHENNAI: Owing to poor maintenance by  , a park opposite the house of former corporation mayor M   in   is in a state of disuse. 

 The park in   was opened in 2007 under Subramanian's tenure as mayor. It has two fountains, a walking area and children's play equipment. Constructed by using the ward development funds of former councillor N Damodaran, the park offered space for recreation for the neighbourhood's residents.
 
 When TOI visited the park on Thursday, the tiles in the walking area had come off.   light poles had no lamps and the fountains had no water. A heap of trash, including plastic waste, was found dumped in one of the secluded areas occupied by a water fountain. The park itself was devoid of greenery. "I used to prepare for my runs in the park every morning. I don't use it anymore for fear of injuring myself due to the broken tiles," said Subramanian, who is currently the Saidapet MLA.
 
 He added that he had repeatedly brought the issue of negligence in maintaining the park to corporation officials, but to no avail. "I had petitioned the ward engineer and zonal officer too. Every time, they keep telling me that there are no funds," he said.
 
 According to corporation officials, the park had not been maintained for over 18 months. "During Vardah, the park suffered major damage. There are issues with the park's water supply too. Only one borewell works and gives water. We have taken steps to drill another borewell to ensure the fountain gets water," said a corporation official.
 
 At the park, a woman caretaker told TOI that she had been appointed to maintain the facility less than a month ago. "We had given contractual maintenance for the park only in November. Issues concerning the park will be rectified soon," the official added.
