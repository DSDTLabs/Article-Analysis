AMARAVATI: In an ambitious attempt to make use of natural resources to put the state on the  , the TDP government, led by N  , is seriously planning to develop a zoological park in the thick  .

 The government is of the view that Nallamala, one of the favourite resting places of tigers, could become the hottest wildlife spot if spruced up with best infrastructure to attract tourists. Although AP has two zoological parks at Visakhapatnam and Tirupati, both have failed to carve a niche in luring wildlife enthusiasts. The state government is planning to develop a zoo near Pedda Dor nala mandal of Prakasam district which is on the fringes of Nallamala forest.
 
 Nallamala forest spread over Prakasam, Kurnool and Guntur districts in AP and Mahabubnagar and Nalgonda districts of Telangana was a fortress of Maoists for over a decade. The police and the forest officials were made to flee the forest region when Maoists virtually ruled the region. After the failure of peace talks with the YSR government in 2004, several top Maoists died in encounters with the police.Frequent encounters in the region, forced the Maoists to completely vacate the fo rests and shift their base to   and Chhattisgarh. However, the Nallamala forest fringe villages thickly populated by tribals have not seen any visible development even after the situation completely eased in the region. “We have planned several big-ticket projects in the region. We will bring a zoological park to Pedda Dornala,“ said forests and environment minister Bojjala Gopalakrishna Reddy.
 
 At present, Gundla Brahmeswaram sanctuary is located between Kurnool and Prakasam districts. This is about 30 km from Nandyal and 50 km from Cumbum.
