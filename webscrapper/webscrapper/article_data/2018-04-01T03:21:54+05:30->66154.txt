NEW DELHI: A   flight attendant has alleged that she and her colleague were made to strip in a closed room in front of the airline's female ground staff and then searched at Hyderabad airport on Wednesday night. 

 
  The airline says it had received information that some cabin crew members may be illegally carrying items, either smuggled or pilfered from the plane like cash from onboard sales, on them. Based on that, it conducted random checks on crew by following the standard operating procedure (SOP) where only same gender staffers frisk crew in a way exactly similar to how security personnel frisk passengers during pre-boarding checks. 
 
  "The SOP does not entail asking anyone to take off their clothes. Allegations regarding deviation from these SOPs are being investigated and strict action will be taken if anybody is found guilty," the airline spokesman said. 
 
  The flight attendant, who joined SpiceJet in 2013, says in her written complaint that after landing in Hyderabad she was taken to a room at the airport where four to five female ground staffers of SpiceJet were present. "They cited the need to check our bags. After the bag check was over, the staff forced us to take off our (clothes) and we were frisked in an inappropriate manner. All this happened in front of those female staff," her complaint says. 
 
 The airline spokesman said "As per security and safety SOP, random 'pat down' search is conducted on various employees , including cabin crew, from time to time - a global industry practice. One of the objectives of this search is to ensure that there is no pilferage of company money/goods, smuggling or any illegal activity that an employee may be lured into.SpiceJet has a well laid down SOP for such activity, which has been stringently followed." There were reports of flight attendants protesting in Chennai on Saturday morning that delayed a few flights.
