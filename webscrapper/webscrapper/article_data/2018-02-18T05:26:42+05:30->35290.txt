KOLKATA: A section of parents of students from the south Kolkata school, where a dance teacher —   — allegedly molested a Class-II student on February 8, came out to defend him in a press conference on Saturday. They said he has been “victimized” by a group of parents who want to form a forum in the school.

 Some, however, said they appealed to police to ensure justice. The school, meanwhile, clarified they did not know about the press conference.
 
 Kunal Banerjee, the father of a girl from the same class as the victim, alleged that the suspect was being “framed”. “It is surprising that no one knew what had happened. Yet some parents tried to attack the teachers when the police tried to take   away. These parents have vested interests and are 20-25 in number. They want to take advantage of one situation to flare up an issue that may or may not have happened and humiliate the school,” Banerjee said.
 
 The abused girl’s mother told TOI, “I believe that no child can fabricate facts so many times. I have received support from school and parents and I am confident that we can ensure punishment for the dance teacher.”
 
 Other guardians such as Nabamita Chakraborty and   added that as many as 250 parents have appealed to the police to ensure justice. 
 
 Some guardians feel that since Rana hails from a financially backward section and was on contract, he became an easy target.
