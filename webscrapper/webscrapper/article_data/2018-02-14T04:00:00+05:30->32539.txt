Vadodara: An under-construction commercial complex on the busy Godhra-Ahmedabad highway near the Godhra bus depot was sealed after orders by the district administration. The complex was being constructed without any permission.

 The four-floor building was under construction for the last last year. Sources said that a couple of notices were issued to the complex but the developer did not stop work. Eventually, the matter reached the district collectorate that ordered that the building should be sealed.
 
 Officials fixed a fence on all the openings on the ground floor of the building and sealed it. 
 
 The seal also states that if it was opened, an offence could be registered against the person responsible for doing so.
