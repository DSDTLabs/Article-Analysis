GURUGRAM: The encroachment on the land by a park near the   metro station has left residents of Sector 43 in a fix. They have alleged that the area wedged between the service road and the main road opposite the   (PWO) colony has been encroached upon by cart pullers and tea vendors. According to residents, the area is now frequented by anti-social elements, hampering safety and security of women.

 Residents said that Huda transferred the land in front of the temple near the PWO plots to MCG last year. “When we first moved into this area, it was very clean and tidy,” said Ramesh Vashishta, a resident. “Huda used to manage this area quite well but now, it lies neglected.” 
 
 Residents said the encroachment was not so much of an issue as was the threat to women’s security. “Women are feeling extremely unsafe after two to three cases of eve-teasing over the past few weeks,” said Umesh Sharma, a resident and former RWA president of the Power Welfare Organisation (PWO) colony. The colony was established in 2000 and has nearly 428 plots.
 
 However, other residents hailed MCG for its recent drive against cart pullers and other vendors. “A week ago, this entire stretch was occupied by carts and vendors. But last week, MCG removed illegal encroachment,” said Savita Khanna, another resident of Sector 43, adding, “The presence of the cart pullers was a fire hazard. They lit gas cylinders over their wooden carts. It might have caused an accident any time. Currently, the area stands vacated. The presence of encroachers is marginal, compared to what it was a few days ago.”
 
 When contacted, a MCG official said that the corporation had already cleared the area last week. “If there are any other issues, we will look into it,” he added.
