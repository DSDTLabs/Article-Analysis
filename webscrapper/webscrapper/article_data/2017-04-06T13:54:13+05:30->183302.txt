Musician   says guitar   is in an insipid state with only a few individuals honing their craft. 

 The 58-year-old former Jam frontman struggles to think of many rock bands that have caught his attention lately and says he is more of a fan of hip-hop like Kendrick Lamar, with the exception of singer/songwriter   and his pals in   and Savoy Motel. 
 
  
  
 "I find it insipid at the moment. I can't think of any guitar bands, English bands anyway, at the moment. I quite like an American band called Savoy Motel; I like their last record. And Syd Arthur I really love - they're mates as well, I really like them," Paul says. 
 
 "Lucy Rose has got a new album coming out in the next few months that's really great. There are a lot of great individual records and individuals really."
