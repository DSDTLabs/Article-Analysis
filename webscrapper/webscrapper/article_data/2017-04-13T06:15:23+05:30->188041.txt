AHMEDABAD:   will now be able   through two   at the domestic terminus of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in the city.

 The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has installed two self check-in machines at the airport. Once a passenger feeds in his PNR number, it will give print out the boarding pass. Passengers can also select seat options at these machines. With this, flyers can avoid long queues and save time at the airport. Earlier, passengers had to reach the airport well in advance before their flightâ€™s departure time, to have their check-in procedure done.
 
 Beside these machines, the number of scanners at the airport has also been increased, from three to five, at the domestic terminal and from two to four at the international terminal at SVPI airport.
