NEW DELHI: In trying to   her   from being attacked by a neighbour, a 23-year-old girl was   to death in south-west Delhi’s Dabri on Tuesday morning. The mother of the girl, who too had intervened in the melee, also received knife wounds, police said. 

 The accused, Sumit, had entered Jyoti’s house intending to kill her brother, Nitin, whom he suspected of harassing his wife when he was away at work. Sumit had come to the house carrying a knife. According to police, Sumit, who was arrested later in the day, told them during questioning that he had found the door to the house ajar and walked in. Nitin saw him walking towards one of the rooms and stopped him, realising that his sister was in that room.
 
 When he came face to face with Nitin, Sumit began hitting him and hurling abuses at him. Hearing the commotion, Jyoti and her mother Rajbala rushed out to see what was happening. They tried to separate the two men, one of them holding Sumit from behind, the other, Nitin.
 
 The intruder, however, managed to free himself from their clutches and stabbed Rajbala. When Jyoti tried to save her mother, he stabbed her in the chest too. But Jyoti didn’t let go of him even as she desperately called for help.
 
 Hearing the commotion, a crowd gathered outside. And just as Sumit managed to break free a second time and run out, they caught hold of him. Police were soon called and Sumit was arrested. 
 
 Meanwhile, the mother-daughter duo was rushed to a hospital nearby where Jyoti succumbed to her injuries and Rajbala was critical. 
 
 “Sumit confessed to his crime,” said Surender Kumar, DCP (Southwest).
 
 According to the cops, Sumit alleged that his neighbour had been harassing his wife because of which he had asked his wife not to speak to Nitin. The murderer told police that he was insecure about the fact that his wife was amiably disposed towards Nitin. Sumit had had several arguments with his wife over the matter.
