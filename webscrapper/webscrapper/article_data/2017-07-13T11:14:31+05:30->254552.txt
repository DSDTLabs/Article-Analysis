CHANDIGARH: Come October, the afternoon Shatabdi plying from Chandigarh to New Delhi will be operational on Sundays too. The   got an approval from Indian Railways to ply Shatabdi Express 12046 on Sundays and keep it non-operational on Wednesdays.

 Ambala division railway manager Dinesh Kumar said confirmed that the instructions would be implemented from October, as the new timetable would be introduced in that month. He said the decision has been taken after they had sent a proposal to the railways ministry to make the train operational on Sundays and stop plying it on Wednesdays.
 
 Kumar said they were also planning to add trains on the Chandigarh-Ludhiana stretch after adding more rail lines to the   route. He said the fresh deadline for adding the rail tracks was September, as the electrical department had delayed the task.
 
 In March this year, the railways had conducted a trialrun for a locomotive on the tracks and a newly constructed bridge on   river. At that time, it was found that there had been delay in electrifying the section. Later, in July, the electrical department had claimed to have completed the work.
 
 Sources said though the tracks would be laid by September, they would start functioning only after the Commission of Railway Safety gives a go-ahead after an inspection. The Ambala division has already submitted the project for cutting down travelling time of Shatabdi trains after the rail tracks are added. With the addition of track, maximum speed of the trains is expected to increase from 110km/hour to 130km/hour.
 
 The 22km distance between   and Ambala Cantonment railway station has been completed, while the 23km distance between Chandigarh and Dappar is under progress.
