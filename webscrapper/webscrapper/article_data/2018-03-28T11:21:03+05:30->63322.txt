PANAJI: A four-member committee headed by the town and country planning (TCP) minister Vijai   will next hold talks with representatives from   panchayat over the issue of the inclusion of the villages into the   (GPPDA) at the secretariat complex on Wednesday.

 The four-member committee had been formed to decide on issues and apprehension raised by residents of the 10 villages around Kadamba plateau over the high rise growth that the PDA may trigger off with its vertical development approach.
 
 The committee had earlier recommended the removal of Azossim-Mandur and   villages from the   PDA and this had been conveyed to representatives of Azossim-Mandur and Gancim villages by Sardesai last Wednesday.
 
 “There will be more meetings for other villages. After 20 days, we will have another TCP board meeting where we may take up this issue,” Sardesai had stated. Local activists from various Tiswadi villages, likely to be affected by the GPPDA plan, held a meeting on Tuesday night to decide the future course of action – a public meeting in Panaji on April 6. “We will finalize it shortly,” a leader said.
