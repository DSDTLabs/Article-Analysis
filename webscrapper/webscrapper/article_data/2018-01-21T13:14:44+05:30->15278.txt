 "My experiences, which I hope, would enlighten the readers with spiritual thoughts and philosophy, as we take a long journey across the globe.. We derive happiness which is short lived or may derive no happiness because we seldom take a 'journey within', which can reveal our purpose of existence and guide us on the path of eternal happiness," Radhanath Swami said on Thursday night.
 
 He said the mysteries of the soul have evaded mystics, sages and gurus for centuries, humanity has long yearned to discover the purpose of our existence, and many spiritual traditions have evolved through sacred texts that facilitate journeys of transformation and discovery.

 Present on the occasion were Bollywood producer Smita Thackeray, athlete Kranti Salvi, Hungarian Consul-General Norbert Revai-Bere, Mauritius Consul-General Bineshwaree Napaul and TV actor Nitesh Bharadwaj, among others.
