Indore: A group of student leaders protested at The Emerald Heights International School on Friday afternoon accusing the authorities of asking parents to fill a   declaring that any accident on the campus or by bus will not be school’s responsibility. 

 Nearly 20 protesters reached the school and shouted slogan-‘manmani nahi chalegi’ (dictatorship will not be tolerated). 
 
 A few minutes after the protesters started shouting slogans, the school president Muktesh Singh came out of the school and tried to listen to their demands. 
 
 While talking to Singh the protesters asked him about the bond. On this, Singh told them that the bond is for the consent forms that are used during co-curricular activities, including NCC, sports events and student exchange and cultural programmes. 
 
 “Some parents from the school told us about this bond and we took up this issue. The school is forcing parents of new admissions and the remaining students to sign this bond. If parents are paying lakhs of rupees as fees in their school, can’t the school take any responsibility of the students,” said Pichhada Varg Morcha city secretary Love Verma.
 
 None of the parents joined the  . The protesters showed the ‘indemnity bond’ that was being circulated on messaging apps to the school president. 
 
 “I did not get any complaint from the parents. If the parents have any issues over consent forms they can come and complain but the local student leaders who want to gain publicity out of these issues are not welcome. The students take part in several co-curricular activities throughout the year for which we need to get consent forms signed by parents every now and then thus we do it once in the beginning of the year,” said principal Siddharth Singh. 
 
 “Everyone is relating this with DPS bus accident but we have been doing it for the past few years,” added Singh.
