PATNA: The state government on Friday suspended 1987 batch IAS official and former   (BSSC) chairman   for his alleged involvement in the question paper leak of Intermediate level recruitment exam conducted by the BSSC. Kumar was arrested on February 24.
 
  Kumar’s brother  , who was head of the department of geography in Patna Women’s College, along with wife   and nephew Ashish Kumar were also arrested in this connection.
  
  The SIT led by SSP (Patna)   has moved the court for search warrant of Kumar’s house at Hazaribag. “We have moved court for the search warrant which is yet to be granted,” the SSP said. SIT is probing the scam.
  
  Sources said efforts were being made to recover the question booklet and answer key provided to Ashish at the house of Kumar’s in-laws.
  
  Meanwhile, Ashish’s brother Arun Kumar also surrendered before a local court in Patna on Friday. Ashish, Arun, Manju and two more Kumar’s relatives were candidates in the BSSC examination. The examination was later scrapped on February 8.
  
  “No incriminating evidence is available against any other IAS official posted in the BSSC. We have taken action against Sudhir and if someone else is found involved in the scam, we would not hesitate in taking action against him,” a senior police officer said. There have been rumours for the past two days that another IAS official would be arrested in the case soon. “It’s more like a media trial which is not appreciable,” he said while referring to media reports on SIT approaching a court for an arrest warrant against him.
  
  He also said the call details record (CDR) of Kumar and Ashish shows that both were present at Hazaribag on January 23 when the latter was handed over the question booklet and answer keys.
  
  Sources said an economic offences unit (EOU) officer has started working with the SIT for track the money trail in the scam.
