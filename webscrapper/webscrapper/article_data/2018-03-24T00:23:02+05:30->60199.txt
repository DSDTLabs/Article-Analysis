Indore: A 30-year-old man was killed, while his wife and three-month-old baby had a narrow escape when a   ran amok and rammed into their   on roadside in Tetaji Nagar on Friday.

 The family was asleep when the accident took place. “Suresh was killed on the spot and his wife, Sangeeta (25), sustained injuries when the truck crashed into their hut and dragged the couple to a distance, before it overturned,” police said. 
 
 Suresh’s brother Mahesh told media that they are residents of Khargone and work as labourers. They had been working at an under-construction site in Kailod Kartal of Tejaji Nagar as daily wage earners. They had built a make shift house by the roadside to stay close to the site.
 
  On Friday morning, the truck carrying tyres veered off the road and rammed into their hut.
 
 Sangeeta’s mother told police that all of them were sleeping outside but late night the couple went to sleep inside the hut along with the baby because of mosquitoes. Their four-year-old son, however, stayed back with his grandparents. 
 
 After the accident, the shocked family members immediately rushed the three to the hospital where Suresh was declared brought dead and Sangeeta was admitted in the ICU. Doctors said that her condition was critical. They said that the baby had a miraculous escape and sustained some scratches on the back. 
 
 The driver managed to flee the spot soon after the incident, said Tejaji Nagar police adding that the truck was seized from the spot and a case was registered against the accused.
