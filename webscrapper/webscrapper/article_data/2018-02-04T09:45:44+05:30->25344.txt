CHENNAI: Greater Chennai   has intensified its drive to evict unlicenced street   from key stretches in the city. The civic body removed vendors and homeless people occupying NSC Bose Road footpath on Friday and continued the action on Saturday as well.

 NSC Bose Road abutting the Madras high court has to be maintained as a “no-hawking zone” as per court orders. The court examines adherence to its ruling from time-to-time, which forces the corporation to conduct periodical   drives on street vendors, most of whom sell vegetables and fruits. The presence of these vendors have been identified to cause congestion on the stretch.
 
 The corporation also evicted vendors from Pulla Avenue in Shenoy Nagar and nearby localities. In MGR Nagar and KK Nagar neighbourhoods, the corporation removed   by residents, and removed vendors from footpath. However, the drive has come in for criticism from street vending associations who were aggrieved that the corporation is yet to constitute town vending committees. tnn
