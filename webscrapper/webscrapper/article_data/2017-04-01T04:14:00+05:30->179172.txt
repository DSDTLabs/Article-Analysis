Gandhinagar: The state government on Friday tabled the Justice M B Shah Commission report on corruption charges levelled by the Congress against former chief minister Narendra Modi. The Gujarat government claimed that the commission had given Modi a ‘clean chit’. The Congress had accused the former CM of corruption to the tune of Rs 1 lakh crore.

 
 But the Gujarat congress claimed that the report was ‘inconclusive’ and the state government was trying to save the then government. The Gujarat government tabled the report in the assembly but did not give its copies to the MLAs or journalists. The commission was formed in August 2011.
