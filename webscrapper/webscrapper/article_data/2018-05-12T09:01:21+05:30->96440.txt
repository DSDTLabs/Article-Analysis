KOLKATA: For the first time ever in  , National Security Guard ( ) commandos went to   on Wednesday to familiarize themselves with the operations of the   (ICG). The trip was planned, keeping in mind the possibility of joint operations between the two forces in the case of a threat from beyond the coast. During the visit to Haldia, the Black Cat commandos travelled by air cushion vehicles (hovercrafts) and took stock of other equipment the force uses for surveillance and search operations.

 “The country’s security forces need to be aware of each other’s capabilities and the conditions they operate under. This helps to keep them prepared for any operations. The ICG station at Haldia has the surface assets to carry out operations along the entire West Bengal coast. The force has the mandate to stop, board and search suspect vessels. After the 2008 Mumbai terror strike, the role of the ICG has gone up manifold. There may arise a possibility when the NSG would be called in to take on terrorists approaching the coast before they can land and disperse. The first visit was not an exercise though. It was just a familiarization visit,” an official in the ministry of home affairs said.
 
 According to a senior   official, though other forces like the Marine Commandos (MARCOS) are specially trained for operations at sea, the NSG would be reaching any point along the West Bengal coast faster from its base near Kolkata. “There is also the possibility of hijacking of high-value assets from ports and ships,” the official said.
