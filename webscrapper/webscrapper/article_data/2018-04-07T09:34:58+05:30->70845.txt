THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Former minister Thomas  , MLA, is all set to become the state president of  , according to party sources. An announcement in this regard by the party central leadership can be expected anytime.

 The move is seen as an attempt by the leadership to create a balance between the Chandy and A K   factions in the party. The NCP president post has been lying vacant since the death of Uzhavoor Vijayan. National secretary   is holding the charge of state president now.
 
 Chandy and Saseendran are party’s two MLAs. Chandy is closer to the national leadership including general secretary   and president Sharad Pawar. Though they had tried hard to save Chandy’s position in the state cabinet, he had to quit following adverse observations from the High Court in the land encroachment case. As Saseendran was re-inducted as minister, Chandy staked claim for the state president’s post, it is learnt.
