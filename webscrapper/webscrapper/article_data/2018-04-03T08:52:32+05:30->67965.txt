MADURAI: "Earlier, people did not know what they would lose because of the India-based Neutrino Laboratory. But now they know they would lose their cultural and traditional rights," G  , co-ordinator of Poovulagin Nanbargal which went to the   against the project, told TOI. The environmental organisation has decided to appeal against the project again while continuing to frequent the villages around the proposed site and to encourage more people to join the protest. 

 "The explosives used to create the lab will have very dangerous consequences for the eco-system of the Western Ghats. It would also destroy the charnockite rock which is older than all forms of life," Sundarrajan said.
 
 This isn't a developmental project, he said. "it is going to be set up as per the India-US nuclear deal and will only benefit the US." He further said that the state environment impact assessment authority had raised concerns about the project coming up in the watershed area of   dam. "Legally, the TNPCB cannot give the clearance as the committee constituted by it to study the project is yet to submit its report," he said.
