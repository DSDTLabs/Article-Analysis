While not many actors would take up the challenge of joining a show that is set to end in three weeks,   has no such apprehensions. The actor is all set to re-enter ' ' mere 21 days before it goes off air. His second innings on the show will feature him as the antagonist, as opposed to the positive turn earlier. His character was killed on the show and now, he has risen from the dead. Iqbal tells us, “The producer is a dear friend, and that is one of the main reasons for me being a part of the show. Also, unlike other makers who try to cut corners once their show nears its end, this one has been consistent in terms of production quality. Well, I am back as the antagonist, who turns out to be the most crucial character in the story.”

 The rising-from-the-dead tracks have often been ridiculed by purists. However, for Iqbal, what matters is the audience’s verdict. He says, “I don’t find it bizarre at all. My track isn’t on those lines and also, we are catering to the audience and have to make shows that they like to watch. The only thing that drives an actor to work is the belief that you are making something that is being liked by the audience. That’s possibly the reason why I have survived in the industry for so long — I do with full conviction whatever I am asked to do.” 
 
 Iqbal has been most loved for his romantic avatar on the small screen. Ask him if playing a negative character comes easy to him and he replies, “Personally, I don’t see myself as a romantic guy on screen. I have no idea how it worked for me and I take it as a compliment. I am romantic, but in my personal space. However, I am up for any character — negative or positive — as long as it’s challenging.”
