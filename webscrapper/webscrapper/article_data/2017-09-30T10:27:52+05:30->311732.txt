COIMBATORE: Ahead of the four-day long festival holidays beginning from Friday, prices of flowers, banana leaves and sugarcane have shot up in the last two days. However, vegetable prices have remained nearly the same. 

 Speaking to TOI, owner of a flower shop in the city S R Ravi said on Thursday: “Jasmine is selling at Rs 900/kg today, while it was Rs 600/kg two days ago. At the same time, marigold was selling at Rs 320/kg as against Rs 160/kg two days ago.” While jasmine is among the less sought flowers, marigold is most purchased flower this festive season. 
 
  said that they purchased marigold for Rs 200/kg on Thursday morning but prices shot up by evening. R Muthusamy, 70, a resident of   said, “When I went to purchase flowers, marigold was sold for Rs 160/kg and Rs 200/kg. The Rs 160/kg variety was withered and little old. Rs 200/kg variety was of good quality.” 
 
 Flower traders say that the prices are 30% dearer than the last year’s festive season. “Late rains are the reason for high prices. The flowers did not bloom on time, and the late spell of rains ended up damaging many flowers,” Ravi said. 
 
 While flower prices shot up, vegetable prices did not increase. “The prices had shot up a few days ago after the rains. Now, they have come down. The festival weekend has not had any impact on the vegetable prices,” said the secretary of the Saibaba Colony Vegetable Market V A Wahab. 
 
 However, presuming that there will be shortage of vegetables owing to the long weekend holidays, people flocked to vegetable markets on Thursday morning.
