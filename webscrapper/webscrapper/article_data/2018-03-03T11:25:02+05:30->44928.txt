MARGAO: Sports and   minister Manohar ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar said the government would provide toilets and changing room facilities along the beach belt from   in the south to   ( ) beach in the north.

 “The beaches of Calangute, Candolim and Baga already have these facilities. The department is facing a problem as approval is required from CRZ authorities to undertake these works,” Azgaonkar said on Wednesday after inaugurating the   football ground and changing room facilities.
 
 “NGOs approach NGT and other courts, and that’s why work gets hampered,” he said, referring to the case of Colva beach where the case dragged on for three years in the NGT. 
 
 “We won, but that money has gone back because it was not utilized. Now we have started work again,” he said. “We want to provide the facility, but there are formalities to be followed,” he said, adding that the department is also taking the panchayat into confidence. 
 
 Azgaonkar assured to provide funds to construct lawns for the Davorlim football ground, provided the local panchayat provides a written assurance to the sports department of maintaining the facility.
 
 “Goa has over 2,000 grounds as compared to other states in the country. Although the sport runs in our blood, the state lacks quality footballers. The sports clubs and former football players ought to groom young talents. The lawns of many football grounds in the state get into a very bad condition a couple of months after being inaugurated,” he said.
