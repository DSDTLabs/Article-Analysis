GHAZIABAD: A gang of nine mobile phone   and two vehicle lifters were arrested on Sunday evening and Monday morning respectively. The mobile phone snatchers used to sell the stolen phones in Delhi’s Gaffar Market through a local shopkeeper. The vehicle lifters belonged to an inter-state gang and had stolen vehicles from Delhi, Noida and Meerut, besides Ghaziabad. Police have seized seven motorcycles, three mopeds, and two fake registration papers from their possession.

 According to SP (City) Akash Tomar, “One Juzhar Singh is the Gaffar Market shopkeeper, who used to procure stolen mobile phones from Manoj and Manish, residents of Sihani Gate area, and then sell the electronic gadgets in parts to avoid their IMEI detection. Their prime targets were people walking the roads talking on phones. They would snatch phones while riding bikes and escape through crowded areas.”
 
 The mobile snatchers were arrested from Sihani Gate area on Sunday evening. The vehicle lifters were caught on Monday morning from Lohia Nagar bus stand while the accused – Muzaffar Ali and Anand Pahari – were making a plan to commit another theft.
 
 SHO (Sihani Gate) Vinod Kumar Pandey, who is also in charge of the anti-auto theft cell, said the accused have been in this profession for a long time now and have been to jail in past. More importantly, we have not just seized 10 vehicles from their possession, but also solved 10 cases registered in Delhi NCR simultaneously, he added.
