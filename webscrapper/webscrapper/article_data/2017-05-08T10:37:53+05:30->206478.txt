LUCKNOW: Accusing   in the neighbourhood of harassment, a resident of Kachcha Haata in Aminabad has put up a   outside his house that reads, " Hindu pariwar palayan ko majboor". When TOI spoke to other   in the vicinity, however, they said they had never experienced any   

 The area is mostly commercial and families of different communities have been living together from more than 80 years. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Rahul Garg, who has alleged he is being harassed by his neighbours from the   for the past six months, said he was being pressurised to sell his house where his family has been living for 70 years. Officer in charge of Aminabad police station Ashwini Pandey said Garg created unnecessary sensation in the locality on Saturday evening. "Eight different families stay in the said property out of which seven want to sell it to a local builder. Garg is the only one against the deal. When the builder came to talk to him, Garg decided to put up the board. We convinced him to take it down as it was leading to nuisance and could can lead to unnecessary controversy," said Pandey.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Garg's neighbour Ajay Pandey said, "I never experienced any communal issues with neighbours and we live in absolute harmony." Another resident Vijay Kumar said, "We have been living in Kachcha Haata for 25 years and have never known anyone asking us to leave and I have many friends in the locality from the minority community."
 
 Sandeep Kashyap who resides near Mahila College said, "Living in Kaccha Hata makes you experience the rich culture of Lucknow and I never had any bad experience here, even during the days of Babri Masjid demolition in 1992," added Sandeep.
