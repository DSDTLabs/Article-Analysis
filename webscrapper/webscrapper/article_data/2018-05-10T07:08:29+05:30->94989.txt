BENGALURU: While elections are when the government tends to address civic issues quickly, residents of  , Mahadevapura aren’t so lucky. In fact,   (BWSSB) officials are citing polls as an excuse for not being able to fix overflowing drains in the area.

 
 Residents of four Pai Layout apartments — Vars Casa Cerise, Vars Crystal, Swastik Sapphire and Ramaya Enclave — have been plagued by overflowing drains over the past six months.
 
 They say the drains are blocked due to laying of cable lines within the road space where the sewage network is located. Sewage seeps into their houses through pipelines, making their living conditions unhygienic, they added.
 
 Lalita, a resident of Vars Casa said, “The overflowing sewage has contaminated the borewell, so much so we are unable to drink water from it anymore and depend on tank water instead.”
 
 The residents allege that all their complaints have fallen on deaf years as nobody has come forward to take action. Despite spending thousands of rupees to clean the overflowing manholes, there has been no respite, they added.
 
 “The sewage water is not only flooding the parking area but is also flowing through the pipes into commodes in our toilets which is absolutely disgusting,” said Arunesh, another resident.
 
 Venkatesh, assistant engineer, BWSSB, said, “The permission to dig up roads and clear cable lines has been sanctioned, but we cannot implement the order right now due to elections.”
 
 However, Basavaraj, assistant executive engineer incharge, A Narayanapura, said, “The vehicle used to sort out such issues has broken down and needs to be fixed. We will help residents as soon as this problem is dealt with.”
