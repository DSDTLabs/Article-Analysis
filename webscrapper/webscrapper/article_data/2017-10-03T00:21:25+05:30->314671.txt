Coimbatore: Superintendent of police Pa Moorthy has wrote to senior officials to classify 33 police stations in Coimbatore rural as heavy,   based on the   as in some other districts in the state, which will help to increase the manpower in these stations. 

 In 2010, former DGP Letika Saran had suggested to classify the police stations across the state as heavy, light and medium to sanction police personnel in accordance with area covered and crime rate of each station.
 
 Pa Moorthy, SP of Coimbatore district, said Thudiyalur, Sulur, Perur, Vadvalli, Mettupalayam, Pollachi East, Pollachi West and Madukkarai police stations are covering vast areas with less police personnel in each station. “I have sent letters to senior officials to classify the eight stations as heavy police stations as it would help to reduce crime rates,” said Pa Moorthy.
 
 The state government has sanctioned 1,322 police personnel including a superintendent of police, two ADSPs, 34 inspector of police and 117 sub-inspectors for Coimbatore rural police. The government also sanctioned 566 armed reserve police personnel. 
 
 But the rural police is working with 990 police personnel (including higher officials) and 421 armed reserve police personnel. The rural police has been requesting the state government to fill the existing vacancies of 477 constables to improve law and order situation. Already two proposals had been sent to government to classify the rural police, but in vain.
 
 As per the data available with rural police, around 29, 16,618 people are residing in rural part of Coimbatore in 2011. The number could have increased by 5-7 lakhs. But the rural police has only 1411 personnel.
 
 According to the suggestion, 80 police personnel including two inspectors and four sub-inspectors should be working in heavy police stations. Around 50 police personnel should be deployed in medium police stations and 30 police personnel should be deployed in light police stations.
