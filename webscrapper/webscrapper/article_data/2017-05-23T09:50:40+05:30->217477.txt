LUCKNOW:   forensic science laboratory will not handle viscera and other samples lifted from the crime scene and   cadre   Anurag Tewari’s body. Setting a precedent, SSP Deepak Kumar conceded to the demands of kin of IAS officer on Monday and assured to send the exhibits to other reputed medical science institutes instead.

 Tewari’s brother and complainant Mayank raised doubts on credentials of Mahanagar laboratory, its director and some of his subordinates posted under him. “A joint director level officer of Mahanagar laboratory tried to influence the panel of doctors who conducted autopsy examination, so we have apprehensions. The joint director wanted to show Anurag’s death as natural and argued with doctors at the KGMU mortuary. Senior administrative officials know about it but have not done anything,” said Mayank, the brother of late Tewari.
 
 Kumar said taking into account their reservations, he will write to Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University and All India Institute of Medical Science and get the examination done. “If need be, I will approach Central Forensic Science Laboratory,” said Kumar.
 
 The panel of doctors have preserved stomach contents, portions of small intestine, liver, gall bladder, spleen, both kidneys, whole of heart and blood sample for forensic examination.
