MUMBAI: The Development Plan (DP) 2034 unveiled earlier this week has slashed the discretionary powers of the municipal commissioner from 35 to 12. Last August, the   had proposed reducing the powers to 14. Most of the powers that have been taken away from the civic chief relate to construction activity.

 Some proposals which no longer need to come through the commissioner are to allow construction of a second staircase in a building for a society office on the upper floors, 25% additional parking space, construction of podium on a plot less than 1,500 sq m, a shop or nursing home in a building and to not count internal staircase area for shops/restaurants/duplex flats in  .
 
 Civic chief   said that anyway, builders have to pay a premium for these concessions. “So, it does not make sense for builders to send files to the commissioner again. This would also fasten the processes,” he said. The move is a part of the BMC’s ease of doing business initiative.
 
 Officials said that the 12 provisions for which the civic chief ’s permission is required are extremely crucial and hence, they cannot be delegated to anyone. Some of them include condoning the deficiency in open space, and not counting the area of staircase, staircase lobby, lift, lift lobby, etc in FSI.
 
 Pankaj  , executive director,   questioned the need for keeping some powers with the municipal commissioner. “The problem with keeping powers with an authority is that who does one show discretion towards? The law should be equal for all and hence, no such power should be kept with the civic chief,” said Joshi.
