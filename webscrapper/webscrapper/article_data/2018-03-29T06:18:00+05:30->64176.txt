Ghaziabad: Three months after a Delhi-based trader was robbed of Rs 2.5 lakh in Indirapuram, the accused was arrested on Wednesday. The youth’s accomplice was nabbed a few days after the loot and the police had announced a reward of Rs 10,000 on the former.

 The accused, Manoj alias Sagar (26), had looted trader Rohit Bhardwaj (33) with the help of his accomplice on the evening of January 2 on a road running parallel to a green belt opposite Shakti Khand 4 in Indirapuram. Bhardwaj, an exporter, was returning from his office in Paharganj, Delhi to his residence in Ahimsa Khand 2 on a scooter, carrying the cash in a bag, when he was waylaid.
 
 “From investigations conducted so far, it has come to light that Manoj has criminal cases against him in Haryana as well. His accomplice, Riyaz, was arrested on January 6. We nabbed Manoj from Vaishali after being tipped off about his movements by an informer,” said SHO, Indirapuram, Sachin Malik.
 
 Manoj was sent to judicial custody on Wednesday. After the loot, the police had registered an FIR against unidentified persons under Section 392 of IPC. On Wednesday, police booked Manoj under the Arms Act too after a country-made revolver was seized from him.
 
 “After the arrest of Riyaz on January 6, police claimed to have recovered Rs 80,000 from the total amount that had been looted. The remaining amount is yet to be recovered,” Bhardwaj told TOI.
