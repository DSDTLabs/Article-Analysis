NASHIK: Chief minister   mocked   chief   during his rally in Nashik on Saturday, saying the Sena chief has not held a single rally in rural areas for the   and was talking about farm loan waiver. 

 Earlier this week, Uddhav had said that if the chief minister waives farmers' loans in the state, he would ensure his party's full support forever. 
 
 Fadnavis added that they would waive the loans of farmers at the "right time" and before doing so, the government would strengthen the farming community by providing them crop insurance and other facilities. 
 
 "Yes, we will waive the loans of farmers at the right time. But before that, we will make them strong by providing crop insurance and other facilities," the chief minister said. 
 
 He added, "The farm loan waiver that was announced in 2009 failed because banks were the ones that benefitted from the move at that time, not the farmers." 
 
 Taking cognizance of the demands of the onion farmers from Nashik, Fadnavis said he could understand their plight and was eagerly waiting the model code of conduct to be revoked to announce a comprehensive scheme for them.
