AHMEDABAD: Engaging storytellers take the audience to a make-believe world, and audience members with perceptional acuity can describe vividly their favourite characters’ abode in a magical land or a spaceship. Such a sense of reality, however, is a problem when crime investigators have to differentiate fact from fiction in testimonies. Can our brain help? A study conducted by the Gujarat Forensic Sciences University (GFSU) indicates that it can. 

 
 The study, the MPhil thesis of Amrita Ajit Prasad, carried out   (BEOS) profiling of 50 participants to ascertain whether the signature differs when the person doesn’t have experiential knowledge (EK).
 
 Dr  , an assistant professor at the   ( ), GFSU, who was Prasad’s guide, said that unlike the polygraph test, the BEOS test doesn’t require the assessee to say anything. The person’s response is recorded after he or she is provided with information. “The method is used to determine whether the person has remembrance of a crime in question,” she said.
 
 In the study, the participants were asked to provide two memories and the researchers fabricated a memory for them. When the researchers narrated the details of a farewell — an actual event of which most details had been altered — the persons’ responses clearly indicated that they had no EK of it. Kacker said: “The method can be useful when authorities suspect, for instance, that a statement was made under duress.”
