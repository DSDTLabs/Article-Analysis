MARGAO: Attacking the Congress party, particularly it’s national general secretary Digvijaya Singh for “adopting double standards against the two main accused in the Louis Berger case”, the Nationalist   (NCP) Goa unit  , Churchill Alemao, on Friday hinted at plans to field   for the  , if the proposed alliance with the Congress fails to materialize.

 Stating that there is a need for like-minded secular parties to ally to defeat the   (BJP), Alemao said, “If there is no alliance formed between Congress and NCP, we will not leave a single seat vacant in Congress strongholds in Salcete, besides fielding candidates in Panaji, Saligao and Siolim. NCP leader Praful Patel had sought only seven out of the 40 seats for NCP, so the electorate should not hold us responsible for the consequences”. 
 
 Denying that his electoral prospects in Benaulim constituency would be severely affected if an alliance doesn’t materialize with Congress, Alemao said, “It appears as if the Congress doesn’t seek to come back to power, but secretly wants the BJP government to get re-elected. There is no possibility of Congress forming the government if there is no alliance with the NCP”. 
 
 Alemao disclosed that he had met Singh in Goa and the Congress general secretary denied him a Congress nomination as his name was in the chargesheet filed in the Luis Berger case. “Singh suggested that I join another party and that there would be an alliance with the party. Although Margao MLA Digambar Kamat has also been charged in the same case as the main accused, Singh has announced his candidature,” Alemao said.
