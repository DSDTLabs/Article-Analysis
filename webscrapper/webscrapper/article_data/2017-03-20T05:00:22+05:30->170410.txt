Lucknow: As colours of celebration descended on BJP’s office in Lucknow on March 11, hundreds of workers were seen sprinkling saffron gulaal on each other. But the 6-feettall   stood tallest among all. Former cricketer Raza, who played for UP, took oath as minister on Sunday and is the only Muslim face in the Yogi ministry. A Shia from old Lucknow, Raza, a   spokesman who defends the party on air during debates on various regional news channels, told TOI, “The perception that BJP is an anti-Muslim party is wrong, and by associating myself with it, I have tried to counter that.” While his brother   had past affiliations with Congress, Raza made way into BJP in 2013 through a pro-BJP poster campaign.
