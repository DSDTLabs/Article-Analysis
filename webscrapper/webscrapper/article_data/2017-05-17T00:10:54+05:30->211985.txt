Hyderabad: After the   fiasco, where inspector K   was found holding a placard allegedly to appear like a protester, she was transferred from the Lake Police station on Tuesday.

 Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Central Zone, Joel Davis said that Sridevi, who was drafted for surveillance duty in mufti to watch over anti-social elements at Dharna Chowk, was found holding a placard among the protesters. “We have ordered an inquiry. The inspector has been withdrawn from duty at the Lake Police station with immediate effect and attached to the Central Zone control room pending inquiry,” he said.
 
 Talking to TOI, Sridevi said she had held the placard only for a few seconds while trying to put it away. “I was leading a team of women constables from Warangal. All were in mufti and were rattled when violent protesters started attacking another inspector in civil dress. The constables went behind the colony residents and, while sitting in chairs, picked up the placards there. As soon as I saw them, I rushed to the tent, picked up a placard from a constable and put it away. While I was about to put it away, some media personnel took the videos and the entire episode was portrayed in a wrong way,” Sridevi said.
 
 The inspector was upset that the image of the police was tarnished due to the incident. “I’m ready to face an inquiry and am certain to come clean. No police official has instructed anyone to hold placards. I am very upset about negative portrayal of the police department,” she said.
 
 Police have registered four cases in relation to the violence on Monday. Two were booked against protesters based on complaints by residents and the rest were booked against them based on complaints by injured police personnel. “We will analyse the video footage of the protest and identify the accused,” Davis said.
