HYDERABAD: “I shot at two Iranians,“   told Sam Suida, a bartender at  , Missouri, on February 22 night. Purinton was under the impression that   and his friend   were Iranians, going by what he told Sam Suida.

 After allegedly carrying out the shooting at Austin's Bar and Grille, Olathe, Kansas, Purinton drove more than 60 miles away and entered Applebee's.
 
 Suida's conversation with police on 911 is on record. She told police Purinton had told her that he had shot at two Iranians.He made this disclosure only after she insisted to know why he wanted to hide in her house. Once he told her what he did at Austin's Sam Suida called up the police who drove up to Applebee's and arrested him.
 
 The 51-year-old Purinton was produced in court for his first hearing on Monday. Purinton who has been lodged in the Johnson County jail appeared before the court through videoconferencing.
 
 Following a request made by Purinton, the   Timothy McCarthy provided him with a court-appointed attorney. Michael McCulloch will defend Purinton in the case. In a brief appearance which was for less than 10 minutes before the court, Purinton asked for a copy of the charges against him.
 
 Purinton's jail attire indicated that prison officials did not want to take any chances with the former Navy veteran and pilot as he could harm himself. He was dressed in what was described as an `anti-suicide smock or suit.' This goes to show that Purinton is on `suicide watch' in the jail. The one-piece uniform cannot be torn, so that would prevent him from using it as a means to commit suicide.
 
 When he appeared before the court, Purinton's facial expressions conveyed that he did not quite like what kind of mess he had got into. An official whispered into his ear to aid him in answering the questions of the court through video-conferencing.
