   Sharma, who has been in the news for quite some time for his spat with Sunil Grover on a flight, was busy shooting for his upcoming film Firangi in Bikaner. Kapil flew back to Mumbai on Thursday early morning from Jaipur.
 
  He was shooting at The Laxmi Niwas Palace in Bikaner from April 1 to 5, along with Punjabi actress Monica Gill and Tanu Weds Manu Returns actor Rajesh Sharma. After completing the shooting, Kapil came to Jaipur on Wednesday night where he stayed at a hotel near Jaipur Airport Terminal 2 and flew back to Mumbai early morning to resume shooting for his comedy show. Kapil also celebrated his birthday (April 2) on the film sets in Bikaner.
  
  
 
  
  A source close to the production team added that all this while, Kapil refrained from talking to anyone about his spat with Sunil Grover. “He was focusing on the shooting.There were a few from the production team who even tried to crack some jokes on this issue, but Kapil kept a straight face,“ said the source. Kapil's girlfriend   Chatrath too had accompanied the actor-comedian.
  
  Kapil might come again to Bikaner on April 8 to shoot the remaining scenes. The film will be shot at a few other locations in Rajasthan.
