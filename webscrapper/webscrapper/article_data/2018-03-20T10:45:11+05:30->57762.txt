LUCKNOW: Three days after imposing an entry fee of Rs 10 per person at   (JMP) in Gomtinagar Extension,   is now planning to start cycling facility in the park in the coming months. An area of approximately 9 acres has been reserved for launching cycling in JMP with LDA providing bicycles for a nominal rent. LDA has not decided cycle rent yet, but claims to keep it low, around Rs 5-10. 

 The park is touted as one of Asia's largest parks sprawling across 376 acres. The previous government, which conceived the park, had reserved an area for cycling but it could not be launched. 
 
 LDA vice-chairman   said, "We have around 25 cycles in reserve. We will soon float an Expression of Interest (EOI) to run the facility. The company getting the contract will operate and maintain the bicycles. It will have to see that cycling tracks are smoothened and can also deploy more cycles." 
 
 Since the area was already identified, LDA has constructed cycling tracks and plans to begin facility by May, he added. 
 
 LDA has, meanwhile, awarded the operation and maintenance contract of Gondola boats to a private company on an annual rent of Rs 22 lakh. 
 
 The entrance fee is charged from 8.30am to 6pm and is valid for three hours. Morning walkers, senior citizens and children less than 12 years old are exempt from entry fee.
