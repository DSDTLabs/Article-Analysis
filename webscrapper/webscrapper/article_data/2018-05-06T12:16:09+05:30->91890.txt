PANAJI: Chief secretary   has written to the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) and the revenue department seeking information about a house constructed by power minister   in the vicinity of a protected heritage site at Old Goa. 

 Sharma issued the letters to the two departments on Friday and based on the response, further action would be taken, said sources. Sharma said he would verify the information that has been provided by complainant Aires Rodrigues. “Only after I get the information from the departments concerned and study the matter, I would be able to look into the complaint,” he added.
 
 The advocate and social activist had written to governor Mridula Sinha and Prime Minister   about alleged irregularities in the construction of Madkaikar’s house. Sinha took cognizance of the complaint and asked the chief secretary to take “action as deemed appropriate.” 
 
 According to Rodrigues’ complaint,   has constructed his bungalow within the 300m prohibited area of the Basilica of Bom Jesus Church at Old Goa, which is a protected monument. 
 
 Rodrigues said the compound of the contentious bungalow is less than 50m from the protected site. Secretary to the governor   wrote to Sharma on April 27 enclosing the complaint filed by Rodrigues before the director of ASI and the governor’s office.
 
 Rodrigues had requested Modi and the governor to take action against the BJP minister. According to Rodrigues, the ASI had expressed its inability to take action as it did not have magisterial powers to “remove encroachment or for demolition of illegal structures.”
 
 The deputy director of panchayats, Chandrashekar Shetkar, has asked the Tiswadi block development officer (BDO) to submit a compliance report regarding alleged illegalities in the construction of a bungalow at Old Goa by Madkaikar within four weeks. The BDO has been directed to take action according to provisions of the Goa Panchayat Raj Act.
