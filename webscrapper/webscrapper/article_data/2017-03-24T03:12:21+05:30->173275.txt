 The mistake happened after presenters   and   were mistakenly given the Best Actress envelope with winner  's name inside. 
 
 Gosling says his laughter, which was one of the most viral moments from the ceremony on the internet, was out of relief as he initially thought there was a medical emergency. 
 
  
  
 "What really was happening as I was watching, it was surreal anyway, I was watching people start to have this panicked reaction in the crowd and guys were coming on with headsets and I felt like someone had been hurt."
 
 "I thought there was some kind of medical situation, and I had this worst case scenario playing out in my head," Gosling said. 
 
 "And then I just heard, 'Oh 'Moonlight' won', and I was so relieved that I started laughing. But truthfully, I was also so thrilled that 'Moonlight' won, I know the director... I've worked with them before."
 
 "It's such a ground breaking film, made for a million dollars, and incredible achievement and I'm so happy for them that they were being recognised," he added.
