Vadodara: Officials of the Banswara police in Rajasthan and the health department there conducted a sting operation at Lunawada in Mahisagar district and arrested two for conducting sex determination test. 

 Those arrested include a doctor who ran a gynaecology hospital in the town.
 
 According to sources, the Rajasthan health officials looking into implementation of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act had been getting inputs regarding sex determination being done across the state border in Gujarat. Based on the information, the officials along with the police decided to send decoys and lay a trap to nab those responsible for the tests.
 
 The decoys contacted a nurse who was allegedly an agent of the Bhagat Hospital in Lunawada where sex determination was to be done. The team sent a pregnant woman and others to the hospital run by Dr Mayur Bhagat on Monday evening. The doctor allegedly agreed to do sex determination of the foetus and completed the procedure.
 
 The rest of the team of police and health officials was given a signal by the decoys after sex determination was done. The doctor, along with the nurse, were arrested and taken to Banswara. Sources said that the officials were looking at a major racket and the name of the Lunawada-based doctor had cropped up along with others in Rajasthan.
 
 Mahisgar chief district health officer Dr S B Shah said that they were not taken into confidence while conducting the raid. “They may have informed the local police. We could confirm only later that such an incident had taken place,” said Shah.
