Annoyed that Congress’ Mandrem MLA   did not attend the carnival in Morjim, tourism minister Manohar ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar used a harsh word to criticise him on the floor of the House on Tuesday. The word was expunged after opposition members objected to it. Azgaonkar said Sopte absented himself from the carnival even after a person was sent to him with the invitation. “I was not called for any of the meetings held to organise the carnival,” Sopte said, who was supported by the opposition MLAs.

 Water resources minister Vinod Palyekar told the House on Tuesday that Tillari water canal project needs to be completed as soon as possible. The pending work on Rs 120-crore project covering 10km in Virdi, Sattari, would be taken up shortly, he said. Palyekar was unable to give a deadline for the work which has been dragging on for years. 
 
 PWD minister   told the House that JICA-funded works pertaining to water supply will be completed before 2019. Replies were in response to a question tabled by Taleigao MLA Jennifer Monserrate who sought to know the areas facing water shortage.
