CHANDIGARH: The sudden spurt in clashes between groups of political activists in the state after the new   government took charge has evoked sharp reactions from rival parties. However, despite allegations of involvement of its workers in violence frequently, the Congress has not reacted to the disturbing trend.

 Leader of the opposition in   assembly H S Phoolka said the Congress was trying to control the same "goonda tax" system and mafias that earlier enjoyed patronage of Akalis. "These are the same elements that the incumbent party had promised to root out as part of their election campaign. It is unfortunate that after a change in government, there are fights over control of truck unions and other associations," the AAP leader added.
 
  (SAD) leader Daljit Singh Cheema also accused the Congress of unleashing violent attacks on Akali workers. "On one hand this is murder of democracy and on the other it is resulting in people being brutally killed. This sort of thing is unprecedented," he said.
 
 "Four SAD-BJP councillors of   civic body were illegal detained and humiliated by the Zirakpur police on Monday morning. We demand a high-level inquiry into the whole incident and strict action against the guilty police officials at the earliest," he said.
 
 Over the past one month, there have been allegations of close relatives of local Congress MLAs leading these power struggles in  , and Phillaur and Rama Mandi in  . At Bareta in Mansa, where two people died in a clash between the Congress and Akali groups, the struggle to control the truck union started even before the new government took charge.
 
 "The political party in power eyes truck unions. Each truck union has its own territory and it is alleged that president charges â€˜goonda tax' from each truck depending upon the load and issues a slip allowing it to pick the load," said a former union leader.
