SECUNDERABAD: The dust on reopening of roads in   hasn’t settled yet, curtains were raised for another drama on Wednesday morning when morning walkers kicked up a furore after they were stopped by Army personnel at Wellington Road.

 
 Angry walkers are now planning to knock the Local Military Authority’s door to seek “justice”. The early morning fracas took place on Wellington-Gough Road at   at 6.15am when the soldiers put the walkers in their tracks.
 
 “We were taken aback by their actions. The soldiers said they would not allow us to walk. When we questioned them, they merely said they would allow either two-wheelers or four-wheelers, but have no permission to allow pedestrians,” B Srinivas, a resident of  , told 
 . Srinivas along with some of the colony’s residents has been walking on the stretch for the last 10 years.
 
 In fact, most of the residents, who go for their morning walks, expressed deep anguish over the attitude of the soldiers. Residents of Vasavi Nagar, Sashidhar Colony, Jyothi Colony and West Marredpally set out from a bakery and were abruptly stopped by the military personnel.
 
 “We tried to reason out with them that our walk culminates at West Marredpally petrol outlet via AOC Circle and Allahabad Gate. But, they were in no mood to listen to us and picked up a heated argument. In the meantime, a soldier started recording the sequence of events on a mobile phone. That was uncalled for and totally unacceptable,” a walker bemoaned.
 
 Joining the issue, M Venkatesh of West Marredpally said the soldiers tried to terrify them. “They wanted to frighten us. We stood our ground and soon, they left after 15 minutes. Later, we continued our walk,” he told 
 
 On Monday, the   (MoD) had issued an order asking the   (LMA) to reopen all the closed roads. While 25 roads were closed by the LMA a few years ago, only 11 roads have been reopened since MoD’s order.
