RANCHI: RJD supremo   Prasad was on Saturday sentenced to 14 years in jail and fined Rs 60 lakh by a special   court in connection with the fourth   case pertaining to fraudulent withdrawal of Rs 3.13 crore from Dumka treasury in the early 1990s, a CBI counsel said here. 

  CBI judge Shiv Pal Singh awarded two separate sentences of seven years each under Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Acts, counsel   said. Both sentences will have to be served consecutively, the judge added. 
 
 The court also pronounced the quantum of sentence for 18 other convicts in the case.
 
  Lalu has been serving prison term in Birsa Munda Jail in Ranchi since December 23 last year after being convicted in the second fodder scam case pertaining to illegal withdrawal of money from Deogarh treasury. 
 
  Lalu is currently undergoing treatment at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences in Ranchi, where he was admitted last week after he complained of chest pain and discomfort in jail.
