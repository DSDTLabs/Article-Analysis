KOCHI: Unlike museums in the city which showcase objects of historical significance, Coconut Museum located at the   office compound here, has an array of artefacts including an elaborate model of Taj Mahal, Hindu and Buddhist idols and   portraits made of materials obtained from coconut tree, and nothing else.

 “The museum, inaugurated in 2009 by   while he was the Union minister for agriculture, is mainly a centre for exhibiting the handicrafts and products made by artisans
 
 and craftsmen using the various parts of a coconut and its tree. The exhibits were sourced from the artisans to create a platform for exhibiting their exquisite talents,” said  , sub-editor at the Coconut Board, who takes care of museum affairs as well.
 
 Ganesha, Shiva and Buddha idols carved out from a single log of a coconut tree, and adorned with coconut shells and husks are among the most striking displays in the museum.
 
 The museum, which regularly gets updated with new products made by artisans from across the country, showcases unique art pieces like Patachitra paintings on large coconuts, a lifelike portrait of lions and tigers made of coconut parts, and even household items like lamps, utensils and earrings.
 
 “Lot of foreigners come to the museum, curious about what a ‘coconut museum’ can offer them, and even regular public come for visit and approach us for contacting the artisans, who created the exhibits to buy such artefacts from them directly,” Sona said.
 
 Products made by artisans and craftsmen like Biranji Narayan Das, Dayalu, Jupiter put up for exhibitions organized by the board in various parts of the country, are part of the collection.
 
 “There are artisans who specialize and use only a particular part of the coconut for their work, like its husk or sticks or shells alone, and their products which are displayed in the museum are sometimes taken to be showcased at the stalls of the Coconut Board during exhibitions held in different states,” she added. Apart from notable collectibles like a chess board and its pieces, the museum also has typical Kerala souvenirs like chundanvallam (boat) and elephants made of coconut timber and shells.
