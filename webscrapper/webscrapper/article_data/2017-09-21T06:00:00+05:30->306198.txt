Though a principal is expected to give more time to his office and take care of administrative matters rather than taking classes,   of St Peter’s Engineering College, who loves his students more than the high chair of the principal, ardently wishes it was otherwise. “I love to be in class, teaching the students. I like to be with the teachers and students, rather than sitting in my office. I do take classes, but not as much I would have liked to. But then I have other responsibilities to fulfil, I have to look after the administration as the principal and for that, I have to sit in my office. But whenever I get some free time, I spend it with students and professors,” he says, smiling. And if time permits, he heads straight to the laboratory where he can “help the students will little innovations”.

 Speaking about the most striking feature of the college, he said, “Our college has a strong alumni who is concerned about their alma mater. They visit the campus frequently and talk to the students and update them about their respective fields. This keeps the students well-informed and makes it easier for them to prepare for future accordingly.”
 
 Though Dr Narendra loves his students dearly, he can be extremely strict when it comes to discipline. When he joined St Peter’s this academic year, he was informed by the management that he has to deal with low attendance rates and lack of discipline on campus. “It got me a bit worried,” he says, adding, “But then it dawned upon me that there’s no fun without challenges, neither will the sense of fulfilment be any better.”
 Fortunately for him, he got a team who was willing to cooperate with him to the fullest. “We came up with strict disciplinary rules. Initially it was like an uphill climb, but then the students started falling in line gradually. Their academic performance too has started improving. Now, I couldn’t be more proud of my students,” he says, signing off.
