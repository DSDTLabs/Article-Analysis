BHAGALPUR: The special investigation team (SIT) probing alleged irregularities in appointments in Bihar Agriculture University (BAU) is planning to move court for attachment of properties of former vice-chancellor (VC) and suspended JD (U) MLA Mewa Lal Choudhary. The move comes in wake of Choudhary not appearing before the SIT for interrogation even after issuance of an arrest warrant against him by a local court last week.   Police sources said the court has already rejected Choudhary’s anticipatory bail petition. “Police teams have raided his residences in Tarapur, Patna and other places, but he is absconding,” said a source.    A member of SIT said they will also probe the assets and properties of the former VC, his wife Neeta Choudhary (former JD (U) MLA from Tarapur) and other close relatives. “We apprehend that he might flee from the country. Hence, the only option left now is to move the court for attaching his properties in order to exert pressure on him to surrender,” said a source.    Bhagalpur SSP Manoj Kumar said the SIT has prima-facie found evidences against the former VC true. “We would also seek court’s order to attach the properties of former VC if he remains absconding,” said the SSP.    Legal action against the former VC was initiated on the direction of the governor -cum-chancellor. A probe committee headed by former Justice of Patna high court Justice Syed Mohammed Mahfooz Alam had earlier found the allegations of gross irregularities in appointments of 161 assistant professors and junior scientists in 2012 to be true.
