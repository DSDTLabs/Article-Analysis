CHENNAI: A group of eight   MLAs led by three   called on chief minister   at the secretariat on Monday and asked him to call for a   MLAs immediately. 

 This comes against the backdrop of some AIADMK MLAs accusing the party of not consulting them on any issue. They had been meeting regularly at the MLA hostel in recent days.
 
 The group was jointly led by Senthil Balaji, Thoppu Venkatachalam and K Palaniappan. The meeting with the chief minister went on for an hour. 
 
 “We are in the dark about what is happening in the AIADMK. There are rumours floating on several issues regarding the party and several MLAs are confused about who is leading the party,” said a senior MLA who was part of the group.
 
 Apart from the former ministers, the group included AIADMK MLA from Cheyyar Dusi K Mohan, Harur MLA R Murugan and a few others. “There is no transparency in the working of the AIADMK government. After the government announced the takeover of sand mines, there is no proper policy on it. Many construction employees are without jobs and sand is now sold at a high price per unit,” said the MLA. 
 
 The group also wanted to know what was happening with regard to uniting the two party factions. “There are statements from both factions about uniting. Ministers are speaking about holding talks but the other faction has contradicted it. All the MLAs are confused about the happenings,” the MLA said.
 
 “We asked the chief minister to immediately convene the meeting of MLAs so that we can raise all these issues. We also want the government to implement the promises made in the AIADMK manifesto,” he added.
