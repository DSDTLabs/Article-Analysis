PANAJI:  , casinos and medium of instruction; these are the core issues that the   will fall back on as it attempts to woo voters in the February 4 state assembly elections.

 The manifesto is likely to be released on January 23 at the hands of MP   but the party may find itself hard pressed to convince people about their stand on some of the issues, especially on Regional Plan 2021 and casinos.
 
 GPCC president Luizinho Faleiro has categorically stated that Congress would do all it can to shut down off-shore casinos.
 
 “If the party mentions casinos, then Rane gets uncomfortable. There have been series of meetings but they have not been able to finalize the manifesto,” a party insider said.
 
 The issue of casinos and regional plan was used by the BJP to dethrone Congress in the 2012 state assembly elections and are sensitive for former chief ministers Digambar Kamat and Pratapsingh Rane.
 
 “The manifesto is more or less ready. We have taken inputs from our door-to-door visits and from feedback forms collected by our block workers,” All India Congress Committee secretary Girish Chodankar said.
