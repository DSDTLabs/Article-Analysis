 One prominent player who has been eased out is defender and drag-flick specialist  . The decision may shock some, considering Raghunath had captained India during the Australian tour in November last year. But the writing was on the wall for a while.
 
 Oltmans on Thursday all but shut the door on the Karnataka player's international career. “To be honest, I don't see him coming back,“ he stated. “It was something we discussed and that will always be between him and me.
