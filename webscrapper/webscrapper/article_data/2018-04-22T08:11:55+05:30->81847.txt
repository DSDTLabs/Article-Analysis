LUCKNOW: The National Green Tribunal and Lucknow Municipal Corporation have clearly imposed rules for slaughtering animals but almost all butchers and roadside shops violate the norms. Going against the rules, they butcher the meat in open, run shops near vegetable mandis or   and dump the waste in open drains.

 TOI took stock of the situation on Saturday as the Yogi-led government completed one year of the crackdown on illegal  .
 
  
  
  
 
 
 It was surprising to see that almost all meat shops displayed the slaughtered animal in the open, despite norms mandating that meat should not be visible to the public. The carcass was hanging out, drawing flies to it. Norms also say that an animal cannot be slaughtered inside a shop but in Vivek Khand, Gomtinagar, Munshipulia crossing, Shalimar Crossing in   and Vikasnagar, the animal was seen being slaughtered inside shops in public view.

 Sarfaraz, a resident of Indiranagar, said, “One cannot walk in Azadnagar Mandi of HAL, where meat is slaughtered. The drains are brimming with blood and waste. The surrounding is gory.” No meat shop should exist within 100 metre periphery of a vegetable mandi but here, meat-sellers are slaughtering and dumping waste in drains next to vegetable shops. In LDA Colony, Bara Birwa, a meat shop is in the vicinity of a vegetable mandi.
 
 At Munshipulia crossing, butcher shops are in proximity of a temple and mosque, against the rules, as also in Rajajipuram near  . “It is not good to walk past a mutton shop with dead animals around while going towards the temple.   should check its location,” said Sunita Srivastava.
 
 In posh Vivek Khand, a butcher slaughters animals on a wooden plank in the open. A local said, “So many flies surround the meat. It is bound to cause infection.”
