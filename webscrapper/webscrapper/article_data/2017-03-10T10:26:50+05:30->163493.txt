VADODARA: The showcase project of Ratribazaar of the   (VMC) seems to have become free for all. The   was forced to swing into action to take care of the situation at the night food market as   became rampant there and shops were sublet freely.

 The work on Ratribazaar near the VUDA Circle was completed in 2012 and shops were given on lease by the civic body in 2013. The market has 42 shops in all including 12 large shops with an area of 16 square meters and 30 small shops with an area of four square meters. The shops were initially given permission to operate till 1am, but this was extended till 4am recently.
 
 Recent visits by senior officials of the VMC had revealed that the shopkeepers at the market had encroached upon open space in the market by making shades and similar structures illegally. 
 
 Some had even made civil constructions like platforms and walls there.
 
 Encroachment teams of the civic body that reached the market on Thursday morning found over seventy illegal shades and razed them. Around 12 truckloads of other material including furniture of the shops that was kept in the open space was also seized.
 
 Another major irregularity that had come to light was that shops had been sublet by the original lessees to others. According to the rules set for renting out the shops, the original tenant cannot rent it out again to another person. “Against 42 shops there, around 100 were actually operating. Some persons had sublet their outlets to more than one person who operated from the same space,” said VMC commissioner Dr  .
 
 VMC has started the process of issuing notices to those persons who sublet their shops. The lease of such persons may even be cancelled and they may be asked to vacate the shops.
