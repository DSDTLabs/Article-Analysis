GREATER NOIDA: In a closed door meeting held with the top officers of Noida,   and Yamuna expressway authorities, minister for industrial development   has directed the three authorities to get their act together and start delivering on state government schemes and tackle pending issues.

 Shortly after the meeting, which lasted for over four hours at the Gautam Budh University in Greater Noida, Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh told TOI that the minister pulled up Greater Noida authority for failing to utilise its budget of Rs 114 crore during the financial year 2017-18. 
 
 “Only Rs 24 crore has been utilised for development during the year in Greater Noida while none of the government schemes like Swachch Bharat Abhiyan, city development and other improvement activities have been implemented. The homebuyers have submitted a list of complaints which will be taken to chief minister Yogi Adityanath,” Singh said. Issues like school fee hike, parking rate at Sector 18 market, farmers compensation were also discussed.
