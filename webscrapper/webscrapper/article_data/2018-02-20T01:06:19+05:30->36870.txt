NEW DELHI: The   of a   has   about the way   and Delhi Armed Police   of   from   to   and back. 

 While a probe is being conducted why Mandoli jail authorities allowed such a dangerous criminal to be ferried in a private car, questions are also being asked why he was not handcuffed. 
 
 Police cited a Supreme Court order that prohibits the handcuffing of prisoners without judicial consent. That’s why, they said, they often walk hand-in-hand with hardened criminals. 
 
 Officers who didn’t wish to be named asserted that police should be given discretionary powers to handcuff certain prisoners. “The incident could have been averted if the prisoner was handcuffed. Speaking of perception, walking hand-in-hand also brings a policeman in the same level as the criminal,” an officer said.
 
 Sandeep Kumar, the escapee, had killed a businessman in 2014 for not paying extortion money. He was arrested last year. Kumar belongs to Bahadurgarh in Haryana and had worked for Neeraj Bawana and Sandeep Mental for the last five years. He had formed his own gang and joined hands with the Tillu gang. Kumar’s first arrest was in Sultanpuri in 2003. 
 
 Jail sources said Kumar had been asking for a parole since arrest. But it was refused given his criminal record. Sources said he hatched the plot during visitor meetings, and gave final shape to it during his medical visit on February 9. 
 
 Police are also trying to find out why Kumar was so desperate to get out. Sources say he faced a threat from the henchmen of gangster Jitender Gogi in jail. Police now fear a gang war as they suspect Kumar was freed to eliminate his rivals.
