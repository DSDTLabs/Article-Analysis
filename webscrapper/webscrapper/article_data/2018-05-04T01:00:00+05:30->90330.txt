BHAGALPUR: The   police have identified the assailants involved in the murder of ice factory owner and PDS shop operator Ramchandra Sah on Wednesday, and raids are on to nab them.

 Police attributed the crime to rivalry between two gangs of criminals operating in the area. Sah was said to be close to one of the gangs. “We are also probing if it was a result of any land dispute or rangdaari demand,” a Naugachhia police officer told this correspondent over the phone on Thursday.
 
 At least four criminals shot at Sah when he had gone to buy ‘paan’ after closing his PDS shop near the Model police station in Naugachhia on Wednesday evening. On hearing the sound of firing, family members rushed to the spot and took the profusely bleeding 58-year-old to the sadar hospital where doctors declared him “brought dead”.
 
 After shooting at Sah, eyewitnesses said, the criminals escaped on two bikes, firing in the air. Incidentally, the crime took place near the SC/ST, Model and Mahila police stations.
 
 The deceased was a native of Bhawanipur village under the Rangra police station area, but was residing on his business-cum-residential premises near the Bazaar Samiti campus.
 
 Police said Sah was close to a gang of criminals led by Kumodi Yadav of Bhawanipur village. Kumodi has rivalry with another gang led by Moti Yadav, a native of Sadhua Chapar village under the Rangra police station area. 
 
 “The murder appears to be a result of the rivalry between the two gangs,” Naugachhia police district SP Nidhi Rani said on Thursday, adding raids were on to nab the criminals. 
 
 The SP said police were also looking into the criminal antecedents, if any, of Sah. “We have got certain clues and identified the criminals involved in the killing,” she said.
