NAGPUR: Even after call of going cashless post demonetization, Nagpur University’s affiliated colleges are refusing to accept the cheques, demand drafts (DDs) and other modes of cashless transactions. 

 Paying scant disregard to their calls, the private colleges and even some of NU departments continued to ask the students to bring only cash and sending them back if they come out with cheques/DDs. They are also made to stand in serpentine queues for long hours to pay fees in the IT era. Moreover, the students are being forced to illegally purchase prospectus of Rs 100 in every semester for no reason. Even the receipts were given without break up of total fees like tuition, caution money, laboratory and library. This is being done with a view to avoid tax, according to students.
 
 Some students from   at Deekshabhoomi approached TOI with their grievances stating that even receipts didn’t have mention of break-up of fees, which is usually a norm. TOI has in possession some of these receipts.
 
 Ironically, principal PC Pawar defended the move to force the students for bringing cash. “Accepting Rs 100 through cheques is odd, so we tell them to bring cash.”
 
 But when confronted on whether they charge only Rs 100 for all their courses, he went on back foot stating that he was unaware of it and would seek details soon.
 
 He also justified the move to make it mandatory for the students to purchase prospectus in every semester. “We don’t charge much during admission of first semester. Therefore, we ask them to purchase it .” 
 
 NU vice chancellor SP Kane said the colleges shouldn’t force the students to bring cash. “Ideally, the fees should be accepted only through cashless modes like DD, cheques, or through debit or credit cards,” he said.
