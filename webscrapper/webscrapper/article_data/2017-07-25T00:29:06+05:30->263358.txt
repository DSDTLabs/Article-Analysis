Coimbatore: Deputy speaker of Tamil Nadu assembly Pollachi V   has asked why   Haasan is not questioning exorbitant rates of movie tickets despite a government order fixing the rates of the tickets. “Kamal Haasan should ensure that tickets are sold at fixed rates instead of blaming the state government. This affects the tax collection and affects the economy,” he said.

 He also said that DMK could be behind the views expressed by Kamal Haasan. “Kamal has never raised any objection when several scams were brought out in the DMK regime. Only when he wants any movie to be released, he talks about politics,” said Jayaraman. 
 
 Talking about the National Eligibility Entrance Test for MBBS seats, he said that former chief minister J Jayalalithaa wanted an exemption for Tamil Nadu from NEET. “The state government is working towards this and we will definitely get it,” he said.
 
 Also, about the various factions in the party, he said the party was united. “I did not have any fight or argument with Udumalai Radhakrishnan. I spoke to him even today and we have resolved our differences,” he said. He said the MLAs were dedicated to ensure that DMK family politics did not come to power.
