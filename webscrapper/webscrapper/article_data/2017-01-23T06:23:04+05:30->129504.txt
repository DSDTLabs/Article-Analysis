JAIPUR:   kept the jam-packed   with his wit, wisdom and tips on handling various issues at the   ( ) on Sunday.

 In conversation with Puneeta Roy at the session titled ‘Ideate: Freedom to Dream’ on Sunday, Joshi spoke about the girl child, women’s empowerment, parent-child relationship, and read from his poetry and sang songs.
 
 He explained the damage caused to freedom of speech by those in power, who suppress weak voices, while drawing a parallel on how loudspeakers shut out other noises.
 
 “Loudspeakers kill the sound of a flute when you also have drums played together with it. The sound of the flute can be best heard without a loudspeaker or alone. Similar is the damage done by those in power,” he said.
 
 He took a dig at writers/artists who take a high moral ground in their writings but do not react to oppression. “These writers who don’t stand up for what they say or write should be questioned. The audience should reject their writings and be careful in choosing their icons,” said the writer. He advised the youth to engage their parents in every aspect of their lives. “I always inform my parents about my work. They always ask questions that are relevant for me,” he said.
 
 Expressing his dissatisfaction over how Bollywood songs portray women, he said, “Some songs really disturb me. But what’s more disturbing is that the same songs are played during family occasions and women can be seen dancing to them. It could be because they don’t listen to the lyrics.”
 
 He shared the stories behind some of his songs which became popular, and also sang a few of them on popular demand. He concluded the session by singing his poetry ‘Sharm a rahe hai...’ written after women won both the Olympic medals for the country.
