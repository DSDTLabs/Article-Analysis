JAMSHEDPUR: Tribal leader   on Monday urged governor   not to give her approval to the CNT/SPT Amendment Bill until the issue related to the formation of   (TAC)is settled in the high court. The former MP questioned the method of constituting the TAC, which approved the CNT/SPT amendment draft before it was passed by the state government and sent to Governor Droupadi Murmu for ratification, 

 In his representation to the governor, Murmu said that a writ petition (6595/2016), which questions the constitutional validity of the notification issued by the state government on May 5, 2015 pertaining to the formation of the TAC, is pending with the high court since November 17, 2016.
 
 Filed by Murmu himself, the petition also questions the legal validity of the nomination of the chief minister in TAC. Murmu requested the governor that the issue should first be settled in the court of judiciary before she approves the tenancy law amendment bill. 
 
 Hence, the amendment draft passed by TAC should not be considered valid, prima facie and in the larger  , the governor should exercise restraint in giving her consent till the court verdict is out, Murmu said. 
 
 Citing the Constitutional provisions that empower the governor to keep any bill that comes before her for consideration pending for an indefinite period in the interest of peace and good governance, the former lawmaker claimed that the governor can exercise her power to keep the tenancy law amendment bill pending.
 
 “The CNT/SPT Act amendment proposal approved by the TAC is not legal. Therefore the governor should not approve the bill and should keep it pending for indefinite period or till such time the high court verdict is out,” said Murmu. He also said the governor has the power to nullify any law passed by the legislative assembly, legislative council under Section 244 (1), 5 (1) of the Constitution.
