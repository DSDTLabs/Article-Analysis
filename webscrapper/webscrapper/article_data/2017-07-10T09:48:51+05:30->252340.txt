UDHAGAMANDALAM: A man was trampled to death by an elephant in the   forest division on Sunday. Forest officials said the victim was under the influence of alcohol when the incident took place around 3am. 

 M Vellan, 62, from Shenbagakolli village had gone to attend a function at a relative’s place in a nearby village. He was returning home by foot through the forest when the animal attacked him, P Ganesan, Gudalur forest range officer, said. 
 
 “Vellan was under the influence of alcohol and when he was nearing Shenbagakolli an elephant attacked him. His right leg was shattered in the attack,” said Ganesan. “Since forest staff were on night patrol near the spot, they immediately took Vellan to the Gudalur government hospital,” he added.
 
 The Gudalur hospital staff referred the victim to the Ooty government hospital. “However, Vellen died on the way to the hospital,” said Ganesan.
 
 “Shenbagakolli and a few more tribal hamlets are located inside the forest. Despite numerous warning to the residents of the villages, people come out in the dark,” said the forest range officer. Most of the man-animal conflicts in Gudalur area happen because the public are not cautious, said the officer.
 
 “An initial compensation of Rs 50,000 was handed over to the victim’s family. After procedural formalities, the remaining Rs 2.50 lakh will be released,” said Ganesan.
 
 After postmortem, the body was handed over to the family.
