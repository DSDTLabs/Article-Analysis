MADURAI: In yet another fire accident at the   temple, though of minor nature, sparks from an air-conditioning machine were noticed from an office room situated near the hall. The incident took place late on Thursday night.

 Source said the sparks came from the air-conditioned wiring in the room of the temple tahsildar following which electricity was immediately disconnected. The joint commissioner’s office is on the left of the south tower entrance of the temple. However, repair work was not carried out immediately.
 
 The electricity wiring in the temple has been the bone of contention in the past one week after the major fire that broke out at the Veera Vasantharayar mandapam. Many says that parts of the temple like the joint commissioner’s office, are long overdue for renovation. Now, with Thursday’s fire, the wiring work would be inspected and revamped completely, officials said. TNN
