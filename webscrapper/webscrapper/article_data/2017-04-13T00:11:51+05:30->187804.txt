MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the   government to explain why politicians had called the registrar’s office to enquire about the sealing of unauthorized buildings in Navi Mumbai. 

 The court sought the explanation after the Navi Mumbai joint police commissioner gave a clean chit to the politicians who had made calls to the registrar’s office. The report submitted by the police said that the calls had been made not to intimidate, but to make enquiries and verify facts. The calls were made by an officer on special duty to minister Eknath Shinde, MLA Sandeep Naik. A resident had made minister Ravindra Chavan speak to the registrar. MLC Vidya Chavan had made a request to postpone the proceedings, the report said. tnn
