A few months ago, it was a dream day for   when both Siddique and Lal, who have given Malayalam films many of its favorite comedy movies, signed him for two of their directorials.
 
  On February 3, 'Fukri', directed by Siddique, hit the screens and the actor is reveling in the positive feedback coming his way. But, did you know that many years ago, the same actor had to leave the sets of the directors without even grabbing a junior artiste's role?
  
  In a recent interview, Jayasurya said that he had been to the sets of the duo's films 'In Harihar Nagar' and 'Vietnam Colony' in Alappuzha, requesting a chance to star at least as a background actor. However, he wasn't offered a role as the people from the district were prioritized for the shoot. Jayasurya says that however, Siddique remembered his face and even asked him once about not landing a role in two of his movies, despite being a busy filmmaker. 
  
  In 'Fukri', Jayasurya plays Luqman Ali Fukri aka Lucky, who is a fraudster.
