BENGALURU: Test pilot Wing Commander Unni Pillai (retired), who flew HAL's indigenous   (LUH) on the Aero Show's inaugural day, meditates for 30 minutes under his mango grove to stay calm in the skies and keep negative thoughts away. In an interview with TOI, the 54-year-old says he always wants to be the best in what he does. Excerpts.

 
 I meditate for half-an-hour every day under the mango tree on the premises of my house. It keeps the mind calm and kills all ne g ative thoughts. It isn't that we are flying the machine for the first time at the event. It's like opening an envelope. These are heavily instrumented aircraft. We are involved in the project right from the development stage.
 
 
 We learnt from the experiences of the Advanced Light Helicopter and the Light Combat Helicopter. So, when we began with LUH we avoided all the past mistakes. Flying every machine and understanding whether it adheres to the project needs and demands is a big responsibility. We have tested the LUH for all conditions.
 
 
 I wanted to be the best in what I do -flying. Test pilot is the pinnacle of being a good pilot. I had gone through the grind for a year and joined the   as a test pilot in 1995. A test pilot has to be excellent, particularly have a balanced emotional quotient. One cannot have ego or sense of restlessness, otherwise the project suffers.
 
 
 Laughs. When something goes wrong while flying, yes.Any pilot would. While flying at the last aero show, I heard a sound which was abnormal, and it got me worried. Thankfully, it was not something serious.
 
 
 We would definitely be wanting to do our best in front of the boss and the prospective buyers to showcase the product and its capabilities. That's my duty .But flying for people is fun.When they love your performance and wave at you, you feel motivated and want to entertain them the best way possible.
