GURUGRAM: As the row over the maintenance of   intensifies between the   ( ) and   ( ), the bumpy ride on the arterial route is unlikely to end anytime soon. 

 In July last year, NHAI took over the charge of maintenance of the 47km stretch between Rajiv Chowk and Sohna Road. It was also proposed that the highway will be turned into a four or six-lane highway. 
 
 However, nearly six months after the transfer of maintenance rights, the NHAI wrote to PWD in January saying that it would not maintain the Sohna-Alwar Road until it begins the elevated road project on the same route. 
 
  “They (NHAI officials) have written to us twice for taking over the stretch. We have no funds for the highway, so we cannot do it either,”  , executive engineer, PWD, told TOI. PWD, however, said it will continue to maintain the route ahead of Sohna till Rajasthan-Haryana border.
 
  NHAI had earlier pointed out that though the route is designated as a highway, the stretch needed repair in various parts. Due to the battered road, commuters face congestion in many areas, including Badshahpur where the road is extremely narrow.
