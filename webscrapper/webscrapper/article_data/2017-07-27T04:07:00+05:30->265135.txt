Gandhinagar: Balwantsinh Rajput, chief whip of Congress, is likely to be give the party another big shock. If sources are to be believed, national BJP president Amit Shah has succeeded in wooing Balwantsinh into the BJP fold. Now, the Congress chief whip is most likely to file his nomination for the third Rajya Sabha seat for which Ahmed Patel, political secretary of All India Congress president Sonia Gandhi, is contesting for his 5th RS term.

 
 Rajput is a senior leader and a close relative of Shankersinh Vaghela who recently resigned from the Congress. Vaghela also quit from the post of leader of opposition in the Gujarat assembly. Rajput is considered to be one of the richest MLAs among the 11 of the Congress who recently cross-voted in favour of the NDA candidate in the presidential election.
 
 Rajput is MLA from Siddhpur constituency in North Gujarat. He hasnâ€™t been seen since Tuesday morning when he attended state Congress executive committee meeting. Despite the whip issued by the Congress to all MLAs, Rajput did not attend the MLAs meeting on Tuesday evening called by Ahmed Patel. He was also absent on Wednesday when Patel filed his nomination.
 
 According to his official declaration, Rajput is one of the richest MLAs in Gujarat and a leading businessman. He is also considered very close to he Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah.
 
 If Rajput contests as BJP or independent candidate, he can give a tough fight to Ahmed Patel. BJP has 22 excess votes and Rajput is expected to get 11 votes from the Vaghela camp. If he can get around 18 to 20 votes more from Congress MLAs, he can defeat Ahmed Patel.
