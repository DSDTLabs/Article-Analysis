Pilerne: Saligao MLA and rural development agency (RDA) minister Jayesh Salgaonkar recently launched the desilting work of a 300m-long nullah at Marra, Pilerne, and construction of a retaining wall along it. It was a long-pending demand of the people of Pilerne that desilting work of the nullah had to be undertaken as shops and other establishments were situated in close proximity to it. TOI noticed that the dilapidated condition of the nullah rendered its water useless for the purpose of irrigation. “This work is being undertaken by the water resources department at a cost of Rs 12 lakh,” Salgaonkar said.
