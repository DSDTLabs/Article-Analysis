BENGALURU: Around 400 people gathered at Freedom Park on Sunday morning demanding an ordinance legalizing  , a traditional buffalo-racing sport popular in coastal Karnataka. The state government has already said that it would amend the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act to pave the way for the sport.

 The protestors took out a march from   Circle to Freedom Park. Members of several Tulu assocications and pro-Kannada organizations have joined hands under one banner for a pro-kambala campaign.
 
 When asked why the protest when the government has agreed to amend the law,   of Rajadhani Kambala Kriya Samiti said they wanted a permanent solution and that too fast. “The government has supported kambala. We, however, want to ensure that an amendment is made to the Prevention of Cruelty To Animals Act so that the law can never come in the way of kambala,“ said Shastry.
 
 Shastry also said that as kambala season is under way, they wanted the government to act swiftly on lifting the ban.“More than a sport, kambala is a tradition for us. Not having kambala is considered bad luck in many villages. We want the sport to be legalized at the earliest,“ he said.
 
 The organizers said that a memorandum with their demands will be handed over to Governor Vajubhai Vala and chief minister   on Monday.
