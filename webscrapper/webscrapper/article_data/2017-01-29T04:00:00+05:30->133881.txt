Today is the day of reckoning for city girl   (Miss United Continents, second Runner-Up) — who is one of the popular contestants in   season 10 — as the show shall declare its winner today. 

 Also touted to be a potential winner, Lopa is pitted against Manveer Singh Gurjar, Manu Punjabi and Bani J in the grand  . Quite naturally then, while her fans and friends are busy praying, rooting and voting for her, Lopa’s family members have also kept their fingers crossed. Her father   and sister Bhagyashree are in Lonavla and shall attend Bigg Boss’ finale. 
 
 Experiencing a gamut of emotions, Dr Raut says, “My gut feeling says that my daughter Lopamudra will win the show. It will be an emotional moment to see her in person after three months; I will hug her tight when she’ll be out of the celebrity house. When we all return to Nagpur, her mother   will keep her favourite puran poli ready.”
