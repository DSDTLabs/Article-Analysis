UDUPI: To celebrate the completion of four years of PM Narendra Modi’s governance, an   driver and a Modi fan from Kundapur, Udupi district, is   for Re 1for five days.

 
 Satish Prabhu, a resident of Ankadakatte, has been driving his auto for 25 years. The freebie he is offering is not new: it was open in the last three years too, and he intends to provide this subsidy until Modi completes his five-year term.
 
 “When Modi completed one year, I provided subsidized service for two days, and when Modi completed two years, I gave this service for three days. When he finished his third year, the offer was for four days, and for the fourth year, I will provide subsidy for five days. This year, I have already given service to 125 passengers,” he said.
 
 “I am a big fan of Modi. I cannot contribute much to him as I have to look after my family. However, this service makes me feel proud and happy. I’ve kept a box in my auto and passengers put their coin in it. If they have no change, I have kept enough to give them. I wish that next time when Modi visits Udupi, I can give him the amount collected. I thought I would hand over last year’s amount to him, but there was tight security and I couldn’t,” he said.
