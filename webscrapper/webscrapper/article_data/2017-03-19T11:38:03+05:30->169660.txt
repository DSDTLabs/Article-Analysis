PANAJI: The   on November 8 to withdraw   has unsettled the state’s credit and deposit ratio (CD ratio), which has fallen to 27.89% in the quarter ending December 31 against a benchmark of 40%. While Goa has always struggled with a below benchmark  , the data proves that lending, especially to the  , took a hit for nearly two months.

 Credit-deposit ratio, known as CD ratio in the banking sector, is the ratio of how much a bank lends, out of the deposits that it has gathered from customers. 
 
  and Reserve Bank of India officials said they expected a drop in the CD ratio, and are now looking at data for the financial year end or March 31 to see if the number recovers.
 
 Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s late night announcement on November 8, people rushed to deposit Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes that had been demonetized. Deposits as on December 31 jumped to Rs 67,844.47 crore, an increase of Rs 8,223.15 crore from Rs 59,621.32 crore, a year ago. “To an extent, yes the drop in the CD ratio due to demonetization is because deposits increased. But, one must also take into account that bankers were not lending,” an RBI official said, on condition of anonymity.
