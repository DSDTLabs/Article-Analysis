AHMEDABAD: Large number of villagers in Navabandar near   flocked the   to see a 30-feet long   that washed ashore on Thursday morning. 

 At the first glance, everyone thought that it was dead, but forest department staff who had rushed to the spot confirmed that it was alive. The mammoth task to push the   into the sea was undertaken by the department and villagers.
 
  
  “Immediately, a rescue operation was undertaken to push the blue whale into the sea. A large volume of sand was removed from around its body using an earthmover. Villagers then began pushing the whale into the sea,” said J G Pandya, the range forest officer. 
 
 Pandya said that the whale was pushed into the sea for nearly 150 metres and ultimately, it swam away.
 
  
  Officials said sighting of a blue whale is rare on Gujarat coast. The sea mammal, which is one of the largest on earth, weighs about 180-200 tonnes, It could grow to a length of 100 feet. 
 
 Dinesh Goswami, who has been working to rescue whale sharks for nearly a decade, said, “This mammal has been seen for the first time on the Gujarat coast. We realized it was a blue whale and immediately undertook an operation to rescue and release it in the sea.”
 
  
  Morning rescue helped save the whale
 
 “The area around the whale was wet and before the temperature could increase it was released into the sea. The whale can breath outside water, too, but rising temperature affects it. We reached the venue by 7am and released it before the air became hotter. The operation was over by 10am,” said RTO Pandya.
