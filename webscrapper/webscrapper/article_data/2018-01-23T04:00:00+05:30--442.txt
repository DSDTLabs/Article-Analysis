Chennai: City-based SaaS startup, Paperflite on Monday said it has raised $4,00,000 worth seed funding in a round led by The Chennai Angels. Founded in Feb 2016 by Vinoth Kumar, Yega Kumarappan and Anant Bhat, the startup offers content enablement software for marketing, sales and channel partners and was part of the first Nasscom Warehouse batch. “Today, content is at the core of how we communicate with our audience. The number of channels are exploding and businesses are losing control over the amount of content they create, how they distribute to the right audience and measure how buyers are engaging with them. We built Paperflite so marketing teams can drive smarter content marketing decisions and empower sales with relevant content contextualised to their sales opportunity” said Kumar. The startup counts companies like Freshworks, Redeye and Marteking Inc among its clients. Girish Mathrubootham, founder and CEO of Freshworks, T R Santhanakrishnan, CEO of Datatracks and ex-CFO of Sutherland Global Services, Mithun Sancheti, CEO of Caratlane participated in the round as a part of The Chennai Angels amongst others. The round also saw participation from Like Mind Ventures led by Krishnan Srinivasan and an HNI group led by Adrian Rusu from Singapore both of whom join the Board as Observers.
