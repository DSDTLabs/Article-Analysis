NAVI MUMBAI: The work on   on   has been left incomplete. The asphalting work has been delayed and the road surface has been left just milled. 

 This has resulted in the road surface being coarse. Bikers have complained that they are losing control and their vehicles are skidding on the road. 
 
 While the   has only sent notices to SPTPL, which is carrying out the   work, asking the agency to speed up the work, citizens have been demanding that the agency should be heavily penalized for inconveniencing motorists.
 
 A PWD official said, “Despite the PWD office serving repeated notices to SPTPL for delaying the repair work, the agency has seemingly turned a deaf ear. Hence, the PWD is likely to levy a penalty if the work is not completed before March-end.”
 
 Prashant Hiwale, a resident of Kharghar said, “The Panvel arm of Uran Phata flyover has been drilled, leaving the road surface coarse and the bikers have been losing control while taking the flyover.”
