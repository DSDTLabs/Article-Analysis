Bathinda: Teachers working at Adarsh School of Midduman village in Faridkot have been protesting against the non-disbursal of salaries for the past seven months. The teachers on Thursday called on the Faridkot district administration and urged the officials to impress upon the Sukhsagar Avenue Welfare Society that runs the school to pay them the salaries.

 Earlier on Wednesday, seven teachers withdrew their protest when they climbed down the water tank. The teachers, including five women, came down at 9 pm on the assurance of the district administration and the village panchayat. A teacher, Gurpreet Kaur, told TOI, “We are 30 teachers employed at Adarsh School in Midduman village at salaries of Rs 11,500 and above. We took up the matter with various authorities and even approached them but no one came to our rescue. Owing to the hard times we are forced to protest and want that the district administration take charge of disbursing the salaries.”
 
 Faridkot deputy commissioner Rajiv Parashar said that a meeting was held with teachers on Thursday and the administration was trying to reach some solution and are making efforts in this regard.”
