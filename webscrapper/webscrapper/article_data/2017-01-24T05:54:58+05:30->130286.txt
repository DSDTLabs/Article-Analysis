LUCKNOW: A large number of people gathered outside   in Gomtinagar in protest after they were told that their notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 would not be exchanged. The protesters stopped traffic on the main road and had to be dispersed by police. They were later informed by police that the bank will paste a notice declaring only NRIs can make the exchange at the branch. Nayyar Alam, who had come from Azamgarh, said “They asked me to go to Lucknow to exchange Rs 6,000 I had. Now, guards are telling us to go to Delhi or Mumbai.” 

 Shweta Tiwari, standing outside the office for hours, said, “No official has come to talk to us. Guards say only NRIs have been allowed to exchange notes till March 31. Is the common man not important?”
 
 According to RBI’s notification, those who did not exchange old notes till December 30 because they were out of the country at the time can do so in RBI offices in Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, and Nagpur.
