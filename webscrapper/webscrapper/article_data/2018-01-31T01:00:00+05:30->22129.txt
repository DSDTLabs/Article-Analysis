GAYA: Hearing in the public grievance redressal case seeking   of the office of the Magadh division commissioner on the ground of it being located on what used to be a water body (Dighi talab), on Tuesday remained incomplete and has been deferred till February 15. RTI activist Brajnandan Pathak has sought demolition of the office of the divisional commissioner and restoration of the water body.

 The demand has been made in the light of the SC order on restoration of extinct water bodies and state government directive regarding implementation of the court order. Pathak, in his petition also alleged that the building was constructed without the mandatory approval of the municipal body. Interestingly, Magadh division commissioner Jitendra Srivastav is hearing the complaint in his quasi judicial capacity.
 
 Earlier, the commissioner sought report on the status of the 1.06 acre land on which the office was constructed about two decades back. Separate reports were sought from the Gaya Sadar SDO and the municipal commissioner.
 
 The SDO referred the matter to the circle officer of the Town block. The CO, in his report said as per the recent survey records, the plot on which the commissioner office has been constructed used to be a 'phulwari' (garden).
 
 In his report, the municipal commissioner said that from the records it was not clear whether the map was approved or not. At the same time, the report said that as per Section 8-A of the Building Laws, permission of the municipal body was not required for constructing offices of the central and state government.
 
 According to Pathak, the divisional commissioner has sought his response on the reports submitted by the circle officer as well as the municipal commissioner.
