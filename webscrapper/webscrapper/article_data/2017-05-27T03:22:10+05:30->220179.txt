GURUGRAM: Now,   will have to submit their passport size photos while getting an   test done at the   in Civil Lines. The new move is being introduced to check misuse of the test by pregnant women and control pre-natal sex determination.

 As per rules, it is mandatory for women to show their identification while getting an ultrasound test done. This rule was imposed by the   to curb the pre-natal sex determination and female feticide. However, often women would submit their husbands’ identity proofs at the hospital. But now any woman not submitting her own identity proof, will have to give their photos along with the husbands’ documents.
 
 According to sources, it was noticed that the facility was being misused by few couples to check if the woman was pregnant or not. Especially in case of an unplanned or out of wedlock pregnancy, the tests were used to check the status of the pregnancy. Often such women gave their fake name at the time of tests. Later, when the health officials tried tracking her to ensure that the woman was having a safe pregnancy, she was not traceable. So from now the women will either have to give their own proofs or their photos along with her partner’s identity proof. The man’s identity proof and the woman’s photograph will be maintained in the hospital records as husband and wife.
