AMRITSAR: AAP MLA   has alleged that the "cold shoulder treatment" given to Canadian Prime Minister   during his weeklong India visit had not only revived the died down   movement but has also endangered the prospects of Punjabis migrating to  . 

 Senior advocate Phoolka said that the lukewarm welcome to Trudeau has not only internationalized the Khalistan issue but its repercussion could reflect on the prospects of large number of Punjabis moving to Canada every year.
 
 "Khalistan issue had almost died down. However, the manner in which the government handled this, today Khalistan issue is being talked about at international level. In the past, this issue has never got this much publicity," said Phoolka in a press release issued here on Saturday.
 
 The Dakha MLA informed that he had moved a resolution in the Punjab assembly proposing that the House should thank people and government of Canada for providing home-like atmosphere to people of Indian-origin in Canada.
 
 "This resolution has been filed in the office of the assembly on March 1, and will be taken up in next session of assembly," he said, adding that he had also proposed that the assembly should pass a recommendation to Punjab government to accord due respect to any high official or minister of Canada visiting the state.
 
 He alleged that due to 'unthoughtful' action of Punjab government that it had endangered prospects of about 80,000 to 90,000 Punjabis migrating to Canada every year. He claimed 40,000-50,000 youth from Punjab go to Canada every year on study visa and equal number go on other visas.
 
 "Canada is a superpower today and can help Punjab in the fields of education, health, farming and environment. Punjab has lost this opportunity," he said while questioning the government to explain in the House why it had caused such a great damage.
