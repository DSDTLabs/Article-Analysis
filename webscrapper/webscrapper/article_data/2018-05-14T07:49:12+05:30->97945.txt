LUCKNOW: Lok Sabha MP and former Union minister Shashi Tharoor on Sunday said someone who doesn’t want to say ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ cannot be called an antinational.

 “I don’t have a problem in saying ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ but if a friend of mine has a problem... If he says that his religion doesn’t allow him to worship his country as Mother Goddess and that he will say ‘Jai Hind’ and ‘Jai Bharat’ but won’t say ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai... then I believe our Constitution gives him the right not to say so,” Tharoor said during a discussion ‘Building the Nation with Politics of Inclusiveness’, organised by UP chapter of All India Professional Congress.
 
 “...But we are governed by people who want all the things done only in their way. So if Mr Amit Shah says you have to say this… then say it or get branded as an anti-national. However, I’m sorry friends… that’s no good reason to say something you otherwise don’t want to,” the Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram said.
 
 Tharoor said the Hinduism has taught the world not just tolerance but acceptance too. “Tolerance is a virtue and a patronising idea. But acceptance is very different. It says that I believe I have the truth, you believe you have the truth. I will respect your truth and you will respect my truth. This is the real Hindu faith. That is the Hindu faith I grew up with like many of you,” he said earning a round of applause.
 
 Addressing over 2,500 members of AIPC and professionals, Tharoor said it was for the first time in the history of India, the very tenets over which Indian democracy stands have been challenged.
 
 Tharoor used couplets of famous poets including Mirza Ghalib, Majaz Lakhnavi and Anwar Jalalpuri to attack the BJP and its policies.
