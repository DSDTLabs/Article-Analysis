NASHIK: The civic body has decided to use social media platforms extensively along with other modes of campaigning to woo voters and ensure huge turnout for the upcoming civic polls on February 21.

 The turnout in the last civic polls was 57 per cent — among the highest in the state. And this time too various organisations and the municipal corporation are gearing up to mobilise the voters through various platforms.
 
 Long distance runner and Olympian Kavita Raut and Mrs International Worldwide Queen 2015 Namita Kohok were appointed as brand ambassadors for creating awareness among first time voters to register themselves in the electoral list.
 
 The   (NMC) will be erecting banners, posters and will be circulating video clips of Raut and Kohak to create awareness among people for increasing voter turnout.
 
 Municipal commissioner Abhishek Krishna also conducted lectures in colleges for creating awareness among students. He appealed to the voters to exercise their right and increase the voting percentage this year.
 
 “We are also working on a plan to increase the voting percentage among youth. We should be ready with the same in a day or two,” said deputy municipal commissioner (administration) Vijay Pagar.
 
 Besides, the civic administration, social activists have also been spreading awareness through pamphlets and social media.   — an NGO with youth volunteers — has been creating awareness through social media since the past few years.
 
 Tuesday was the last day for voters to submit applications of their objections against the voters’ list. Pagar said in two days the applications would be scrutinised and the final voters’ list would be finalised. “Total number of objections that we have received is around 60,000. It is only 5-6% which is fair enough,” said Pagar.
