JAIPUR: Four-wheelers with most   are worn out having racked up much more than the prescribed 2.5 lakh kilometers, home minister   admitted before the   on Monday. Kataria said 200 to 250 of these vehicles will be replaced with new ones in the coming days.

 The minister was responding to a query by BJP MLA from Kishangarh-Bas, Ramhet Singh Yadav, who said police stations near Alwar-Haryana border had vehicles that were totally worn out since these have been driven for 3 lakh to 4 lakh kilometers. Yadav said lack of good condition four-wheelers was hampering police in checking cow smugglers along the Haryana border.
 
 Earlier, during the question hour, the matter was raised by BJP MLA from Tijara, Maman Singh, who complained about lack of police stations and police check-posts in his constituency. Singh said his constituency was vast where illegal mining and cow smuggling were major issues.
 
 In response, home minister Kataria said Tijara there was a significant fall in crimes in Tijara. Kataria said Alwar district has 38 police stations and 47 police check-posts. There are additional check-posts to stop cow smuggling and these will soon be provided with two-wheelers, the home minister said.
 
 “Criminals with sophisticated weapons keep hopping from one police station area to other committing crimes. What can a policeman on motorcycle do to check them? Criminals will put two bullets into him and kill him, so he is scared,” Yadav said in response to Kataria’s reply. “Despite our tip off, the local police do not reach the crime spot or reach half an hour late and then say the criminals escaped,” the MLA said, suggesting that the policemen were scared of organised criminals for want of proper vehicles and weapons. Yadav said deploying temporary staff at the police check-posts was another reason why cow smugglers were not being checked effectively.
