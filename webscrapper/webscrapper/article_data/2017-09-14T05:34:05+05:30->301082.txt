HYDERABAD: Three days after Class XII student   was murdered at an isolated area in the hillocks of Ameenpur, Cybera bad police on Wednesday cracked the case and concluded that her former classmate had throttled her to death. The culprit reportedly confessed that he resorted to the dastardly act as the victim was pressurising him to marry her, while he wanted to end their affair. The accused, who also happens to be 17 years, was her classmate at Silver Oaks School,  , till 2015 and later shifted to a different educational institution.

 Briefing media, Cyberabad police commissioner Sandeep Shandilya said it appears to be a pre-meditated murder. The girl was called to discuss strain in their relationship and take a decision whether to take it forward. The accused said, they had a heated argument and entered into a scuffle. Later, he throttled her and then pushed her off a cliff.
 
 After gathering all technical inputs and, during their analysis, police came to know that it was a male person who disembarked from an auto along with Chandini at Madhavapuri Hills. â€œThere are several things we cannot disclose since both are minors and the girl is already dead. The accused claims that the girl forcing him to marry her was the motive, but this cannot be corroborated since the victim is dead. During the heated argument, she slapped the accused and also threatened to commit suicide. This annoyed the boy. He pinned her down, rained blows and throttled her,'' the commissioner said. CCTVs, installed a month ago by Ameenpur police, helped identify the culprit. The accused had gone to the isolated place a month ago too. After the incident, he walked back to his residence at Deepthisagar Colony, about 4-km away , and did not show any sign of tension or guilt. He was arrested and would be produced before the Juvenile Justice Board.
