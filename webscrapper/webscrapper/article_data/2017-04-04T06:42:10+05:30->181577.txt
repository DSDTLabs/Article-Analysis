 A Srinivas, chief executive officer of Varun Bajaj two-wheeler showroom at  , said, “As per the new BS-IV guidelines, all upcoming motorbikes are being manufactured with the AHO provision like the ‘Daytime Running Lamps’ found on cars. We have sold nearly 2,000 such vehicles in the city.”
 
 The new rules have been framed as per international standards and many European countries have implemented it since 2003.
