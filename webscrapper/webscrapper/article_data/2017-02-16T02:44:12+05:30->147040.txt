 Shama Khanna (36), a resident of Sector 28, said unlit places are more frequented by anti-social elements. “I find it so unsafe to drive on the stretch. I don’t even let my children go out and play in the park after it gets dark.”
 
 Recounting one of his neighbours’ ordeal, a resident in the area on condition of anonymity, said, “On Saturday, two bikers hit my neighbour’s 15-year-old daughter while she was returning home from the tuition classes.”
 
 An MCG official said confusion between MCG and DHBVN led to snapping of the supply.
 
 “I came to know about it on Friday, which was a holiday. I immediately called up the concerned official. I told them to restore the supply and assured them to pay the dues on Monday, if there are any. However, we found out that there was some confusion on the supply to streetlights. All dues were paid,” said Suarabh Nain, sub-divisional officer, MCG.
