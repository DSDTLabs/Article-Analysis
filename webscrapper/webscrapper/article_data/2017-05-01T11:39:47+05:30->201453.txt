 Chief minister   said the fight against corruption will go on. Finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, MPs, MLAs, other ministers, BJP's northeast organizing secretary Ajal Jamwal and other party leaders also attended the meeting.
 
 BJP insiders said the executive meeting also discussed on how the saffron party can be strengthened organizationally so that it can contest future elections on its own in the state.
 
 In the last assembly polls, BJP stitched an alliance with Asom Gana Parishad, Bodoland People's Front and several other indigenous outfits. State BJP president Ranjit Kumar Das said the party is going to intensify its activities at the grassroots level.
