HYDERABAD: Indian women's cricket team skipper  , the 34-year-old Hyderabadi, who made her international debut at 16, is known all over the world as the ' ' of women's cricket for her exploits with the bat but back home, successive state governments have given her the cold shoulder. 

 Mithali, who led the Indian team to the 2017 World Cup final which they lost to England last Sunday, has been struggling for well over 11 years to get the plot of land (500 yards) which was promised to her by the erstwhile government of the late YS Rajasekhara Reddy.
 
 Post the stupendous show by the Indian women in this year's World Cup, a few state governments have offered goodies for their players. Punjab and Himachal Pradesh have offered DSP post for Harmanpreet Kaur and Sushma Verma, while the Madhya Pradesh government has promised to give 50 lakh for the team. However, there has been a chilling silence in the power corridors of the Telangana government. Barring a congratulatory message from chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on the team reaching the final, the government has shown no inclination to honour Mithali. 
 
 The state had lavished goodies on other star players like   and PV Sindhu but has completely ignored the exploits of Mithali despite she scaling new peaks each season.
 
 Mithali's woes began way back in 2005. After reaching the final of the 2005 World Cup which India lost to Australia, she was rewarded with 5 lakh and promised 500 square yards of land. 
 
 Sources close to the family say that land at Quthbullapur was also identified but nothing happened after that.
