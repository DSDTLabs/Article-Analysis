HYERABAD: The Twitterati went into an overdrive on Friday morning, soon after the ‘skid spell’ started. Many took to social media, saying that   was the reason for slippery roads.

 A tweet from   read, “Dear all pls dont take the   at lower tankbund. There is some oil leaked on road and wet due to rain. Almost 20 to 25 bike riders fel down due to bike skid (sic).
 
 One Irfan tweeted: “Oil leak on   flyover please avoid taking it.” Joining the issue,   said in his tweet: “Be careful oil leaked Telugutalli flyover.” As the tweets rained on the dangers of riding on Telugu Thalli flyover, police stepped in to clear any misgivings.
 
 “Similar incidents of motorists skidding on slippery roads were reported from across the city during the same time. So, we are not sure about the oil spill theory. It could be surface of the road with some oil on it or also the condition of the tyres,” a traffic inspector explained. Cops also spoke about pictures doing the rounds on social media on the purported ‘oil leak’ on the flyover. “The issue has been resolved,” a cop said.
