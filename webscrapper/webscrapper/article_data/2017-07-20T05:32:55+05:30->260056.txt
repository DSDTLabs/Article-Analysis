KOLKATA:  , where   resided, has turned into a dreaded zone this monsoon. Lakhs are now exposed to   threat as the area is a stone’s throw from   station. In the locality, almost every other household has someone suffering from dengue or from some unknown fever. 

 Take for example Abhijit Das, 50, who lives at 133/5 MC Garden Road. Das tested positive last Friday. “As his platelet dropped drastically to 20,000, we took him to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, from where he was turned away due to unavailability of bed. With no option left, he was admitted to a nursing home at Shreebhumi,” said wife Pinki.
 
 Das was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday afternoon as his platelet count went up after transfusion. But the treatment has left a deep hole in the pocket of the auto driver who operates on the Dum Dum-Nager Bazar route. “I had to cough up Rs 20,000 for my treatment. Right now, I am too weak to go back to work,” said Das.
 
 Even last year, pockets of south Dum Dum were severely affected by the mosquito menace. Locals are now seething in anger over the civic body’s ineffectiveness. “We saw civic workers clearing some bushes and sprinkling bleaching powder near Ranjita Mondal’s house after her death. It’s merely an eyewash. The municipality has not done enough to counter this problem,” said Pradipta Ghosh, a local.
 
 South Dum Dum Municipality chairman Pachu Roy argued that most cases cannot be accepted as dengue as they were confirmed by NS1 and not by Elisa test. He, however, admitted that a few cases have been reported and dengue was indeed a concern in some wards.
 
 “We started working on dengue prevention in April. Now we have stepped up the measures. But the locals need to play their part by not allowing water accumulation,” Roy told TOI.
