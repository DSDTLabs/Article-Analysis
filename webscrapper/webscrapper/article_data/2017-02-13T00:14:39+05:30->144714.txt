MUMBAI: Only 50-60% carriageway is available on most internal roads for vehicular traffic, senior   officials said, blaming it on illegal   of cars, tempos, auto-rickshaws and taxis on both sides of the road; this has reduced the speed of vehicles to 10-20 kmph during peak hours, they added.

  said that before implementing the new parking policy, the civic authorities should crack the whip on   parking on roads.
 
 The situation is grim on arterial roads too, with some stretches along LBS Marg and SV Road being occupied by parked tempos and other heavy goods vehicles, as well as autos/taxis. 
 
 “This has led to a decrease in speed, a primary reason being illegal parking,” said a senior officer from the transport commissioner’s office.
 
 Activist Jagdeep Desai said tankers, container trailers, contract school buses, tourist buses, dumper trucks, tempos, autos/taxis park illegally on roads. “Should not owners of these vehicles be told to pay hefty parking charges if the new policy is implemented?” he said. Another activist said even if there were more parking lots with hefty fees, many citizens would still park illegally on the road.
 
 Transport expert Ashok Datar said, “Enforcement agencies should first crack the whip on illegal parking. There should be steep fines and stringent prosecution should be a deterrent. The removal of unwanted parking from main arteries is the best way to widen roads.”
 
 Former state transport commissioner V N More told TOI parking was a big and sensitive issue for Mumbaikars. “Eighty per cent people don’t have parking space but still purchase vehicles and park them on the road. This is unwarranted,” he said, adding that the only way to dissuade people from purchasing more cars was to strengthen the   transport system.
