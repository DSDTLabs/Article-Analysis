CHENNAI: Since Monday evening, unreserved tickets at five stations in   including   have journey details printed in Tamil, apart from Hindi and English. 

  The system has been introduced at Chennai Central, Egmore, Trichy, Salem and Madurai stations. The tickets issued at Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Palakkad and Kozhikode will have journey details printed in Malayalam, Southern Railway sources said. One counter at each station has been earmarked for this purpose. 
 
  This is a trial measure introduced by Southern Railway for the benefit of lakhs of commuters who don't know Hindi or English. Indian Railways had introduced printing of ticket details in Kannada in   last year. Railways introduced a change in their software to print tickets in other languages. "We are checking if this slows the system. Based on feedback, we shall extend this to all stations soon," a railway official said. TNN
