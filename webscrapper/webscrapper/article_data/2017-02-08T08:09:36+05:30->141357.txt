DUMKA: A delegation of raiyats (private land owners) from Godda on Tuesday urged   commissioner   to stop the ongoing land-acquisition for power plant to be set up by the  . 

 The delegation was led by JVM-P principal general secretary  , who represents Poraiyahat constituency in the assembly. 
 
 JVM (P) is of the opinion that the proposed power plant would harm the larger interests of farmers and villagers . 
 
 Some villagers alleged that there was no representation of the local people at a recent public hearing organised by officials of the Adani group.
 
 At the moment, the government has been acquiring land for the Adanis in nine maujas that fall under Godda sadar and Poraiyahat circles.
 
 "The social impact assessment report prepared by Mumbai-based firm   has ignored the ground realities and local rural representatives were not consulted in the entire process," the delegation said in its representation to the Santhal Pargana commissioner.
 
 The delegation accused the district administration of being hand in glove with the Adanis. It said the public hearing, which was organised in December last, did not have the support of the raiyats.
 
 Two rounds of public hearing were organised in Motiya and a nearby village on December 6. 
 
 Violent protests had broken out during the public hearing leading to a clash between police and villagers. 
 
 Yadav, who had then sat on a dharna along with the villagers, alleged that the district administration had lodged cases against the protesters under Section 107 before the public hearing.
 
 The JVM-P legislator further said, "The agency engaged by the Adanis has got the consent of a few villagers by procuring their thumb impressions and signatures on a format that did not mention anything about the proposed plant."
