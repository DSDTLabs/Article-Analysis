NEW DELHI:   (NCB) has arrested a   for allegedly   heroin worth Rs 1 crore.

 The accused, 31-year-old Brayton N Lyimo, was apprehended at Indira Gandhi International airport on Tuesday night after he landed in Delhi from Mumbai.
 
 Officials said Lyimo was intercepted following intelligence inputs on the activities of international drug cartels. His contacts in Delhi and a few other places were under watch, an NCB officer said.
 
 According to sources, Lyimo was carrying two packets of heroin, totalling 4.8 kg, in his registered baggage. He had arrived in Mumbai on Tuesday from Addis Ababa (Ethiopia). He later took a flight for Delhi.
 
 NCB has charged him under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.
 
 Sources said the contraband was handed over to Lyimo in Tanzania and he had to hand this over to a Nigerian living in India. He is learnt to have come to India in January last year.
 
 NCB, the nodal anti-drugs trafficking agency, keeps an eye on movement of drugs from international territories and within India.
