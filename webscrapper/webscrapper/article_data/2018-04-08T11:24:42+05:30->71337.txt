MARGAO: Town and country planning (TCP) minister   on Saturday dismissed the one-week ultimatum issued by ‘Goemkars against PDAs’ to begin the process of denotifying the planning and development authorities (PDAs) for all villages, scrapping of the Regional Plan 2021, and bringing an amendment to the   Act to empower panchayats to formulate their own plans.

 “This is mobocracy and not democracy, and you cannot talk in a mobocracy. There is now a demand being made that the town planning department be dismantled. I have no powers to do this. Today, it is the TCP department, tomorrow, it will be the irrigation department. Then, let the gram sabha build the nullahs. In this manner, a day will come when they (agitators) will say that there is no need for a government, the gram sabhas will run the government as Goa is a small state.   can run Goa. If this anarchy progresses, how do you expect a civilised rational dialogue?” he said.
 
 Sardesai, hinting that the   had instigated the protests, also said, “Nobody can frighten me and I will not get frightened by anyone. The newbies in Congress should consult the seniors in the party instead of making any kind of statements.”
