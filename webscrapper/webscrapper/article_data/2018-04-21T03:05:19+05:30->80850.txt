GREATER NOIDA: A 35-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly   a passerby dead by accident during a clash between two groups over a plot Dadri in March.

 Nishank  , the circle officer of Dadri, said the accused, Sajid, had been untraceable since the gunfight on March 4. Two groups of villagers had been clashing over 507sqm plot that is apparently owned by   Ahmad, a former deputy chairman of Dadri municipality.
 
 Razzak’s family had claimed their neighbour,  , had forged documents and tried to grab the land. Rezzak had built a wall around the plot, which angered the neighbour and led to an argument.
 
 On March 4, members of the two families had come face to face in a clash with bullets. A passerby, Shamim, was allegedly hit by a stray bullet and died on the spot. Shamim’s brother, Akhtar, had lodged a police complaint, naming Razzak and Fakhruddin.
 
 Police had questioned several persons in connection with the alleged murder and arrested 10 persons. An investigation had revealed that Sajid, who owed allegiance to Fakhruddin, had shot the passerby dead by mistake.
 
 Police said they received a tip-off about Sajid on Friday morning. “We deployed a police team to look for him. Sajid and two of his accomplices tried to speed away on a motorcycle after opening fire at the police team when they were asked to stop. The police retaliated with shots and Sajid was injured in the leg and arrested. The two others managed to escape,” he said.
 
 The police department had announced a Rs 25,000 reward on Sajid’s head. A country-made revolver and three live cartridges were found on him during his arrest. The accused was given a first-aid at the district hospital. “He will be produced in court and sent to judicial custody once he is discharged from hospital,” Sharma said.
