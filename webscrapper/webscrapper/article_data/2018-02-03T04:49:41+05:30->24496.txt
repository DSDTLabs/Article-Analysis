NEW DELHI: India came out strongly in support of the Maldivian opposition on Friday as it asked the   government to abide by the   ruling that all political prisoners, including former president  , be freed.

 The Indian government is closely watching the situation in the archipelago with the opposition led by Nasheed’s   insisting that the court ruling had made it impossible for Yameen to remain in power.
 
 “We have seen last night’s order of the   releasing all political prisoners. In the spirit of democracy and rule of law, it is imperative for all organs of the government of Maldives to respect and abide by the order of the apex court,’’ said an MEA statement, while expressing hope that the safety and security of the Indian expatriates in Maldives will be ensured by the authorities under all circumstances.
 
 “As a close and friendly neighbour, India wishes to see a stable, peaceful and prosperous Maldives. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation,” it added.
