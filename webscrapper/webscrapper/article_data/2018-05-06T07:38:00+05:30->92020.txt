Dharamshala: Three persons accused of gang-rape of a minor girl in Palampur were on Friday evening arrested from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh. They had been on the run from the past more than one week and were reportedly planning to flee to Nepal. 

 On April 27 the girl was gang-raped by five persons when she was going back home from a temple. While two of the accused were arrested by the police the next day, the other three had managed to escape.
 
 “The accused first took shelter at a relative’s place in Kapurthala after committing the crime at Palampur. We arrested that relative on May 1 and it was then that we came to know that the accused had been hiding in Gorakhpur,” Kangra senior superintendent of police (SSP) Santosh Patial said while addressing a media gathering on Saturday. He added that the accused were arrested on Friday evening with the help of UP Police.
 
 The two accused arrested earlier are reportedly minors. 
 
 The girl in her complaint to the police maintained that she and one of her relatives had gone to a temple in a village located near Palampur and on their way back they decided to rest by the road side.
 
 They parked their vehicle and sat on the bench by the road when the accused attacked them. Then they took the girl to nearby pine forest and committed the crime.
