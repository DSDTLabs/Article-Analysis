NAGPUR:   police and crime branch, both working on the   at the residence of Kalyani family at   layout earlier this week, have so far remained groping in the dark without any substantial clue coming in their way. Though some recorded criminals were quizzed, police are yet to make any headway in the case. 

 Sources from Nandanvan police station said that the two most tangible clues, which have come in the way of police, are not sufficient enough to lead to any substantial conclusions so far. The   footage, which have been collected from a neighbourâ€™s residence, is not clear enough to reveal the faces or proper details of the physiques of the burglars. The footage, it was learnt, only suggested the movements of the burglars outside the house and the manner in which one sneaked inside by jumping over the boundary wall. 
 
 The crucial clue of the fingerprint being found on the bulb, which one of the burglars had removed before breaking open the locks, is now being matched and analysed by the specialized wing. 
 
  said that police are toiling hard for a breakthrough in the case.
