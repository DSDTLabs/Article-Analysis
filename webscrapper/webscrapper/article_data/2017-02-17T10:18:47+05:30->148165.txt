 director   Naren’s next film, Naragasooran will mark the Tamil debut of   actor and Samantha’s beau, Naga Chaitanya. We hear that Karthick had recently met   in Hyderabad and had narrated the script to him.

 The film is said to be a dual-hero subject and   has been confirmed as the male lead. A source tells us, “Both Arvind Swami and Naga Chaitanya have agreed to come on board for this project though they are yet to sign on the dotted line. They will be part of parallel stories — while Arvind Swami will play the protagonist, Naga Chaitanya’s character, too, will have equal weightage. Both the actors will have love interests and the team is currently in the process of finalising the actresses for these roles.”
 
 While there was speculation initially that this is going to be a gangster film, the director had previously clarified to us that this will be “an intense suspense drama set against the backdrop of a mountain range”. The film is likely to go on floors by June.
