KOTTAYAM: The   (NSS) has urged the state government to withdraw from the move to rename   to  . In a press note, NSS general secretary   said that he had learned that the Travancore Devaswom Board has taken a decision to rename the temple. This name in no way matches with reality, he said.

 Nair has also submitted a memorandum to chief minister   and devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran in this regard.
 
 He also said that unnecessary controversies are being created in connection with the hill shrine. During the tenure of the previous board of the devaswom, the temple was officially given the name Ayyappa Temple. Just because of that the newly-constituted board has changed the name back to Sree Dharma Sastha Temple. This gives a feeling that even the authorities are confused about the identity of the temple, he said.
 
 Even though the temple was earlier called Sree Dharma Sastha Temple, based on the customs, traditions and beliefs the name should be maintained as Sree Ayyappa Temple, he said.
