MUMBAI: Several parents from   in   refused to take admissions to the next academic year on Saturday following an accident in which a five-year-old lost part of her finger after it was jammed in the classroom door. Some parents even boycotted the sports day rehearsals as a sign of protest.

 The school was to give away forms for admissions to class I on Saturday . The school will now resume the admission process on Monday.
 
 The parents left the school campus only after a school trustee assured parents that precautions would be taken to avoid such incidents and they would also take an undertaking at the beginning of the year to rush children to hospital in case of emergency. He even agreed to reimburse the expense of the surgery, said a parent.
 
  Mistry, a senior KG student, will need a high-end surgery, said another parent, adding that the school's chairman has agreed to compensate the hospital charges. On Saturday, about 250 parents from the school's pre-primary and primary sections protested against the incident.
 
 The trustee convened an urgent meeting to pacify the parents, said one of them. Jeevika's father was in tears, explaining the incident, said a parent who was at the meeting. The parent said the girl's father said that the school called him 45 minutes after the incident. Principal   was not available for comment.
