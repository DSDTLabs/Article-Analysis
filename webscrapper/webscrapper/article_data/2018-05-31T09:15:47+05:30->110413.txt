 Vitthal completed his studies till Class VII in Jalna and went to Beed to study till Class X. “My first experience in Pune wasn’t good,” the boy said, adding that the government boys hostel in Yerawada admitted him much later after his admission, which meant he had to stay on his friends’ mercy in their rooms. “There was no money and nobody to help.
