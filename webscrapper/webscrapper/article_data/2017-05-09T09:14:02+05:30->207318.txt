KANPUR:   and younger sibling of SP patriarch  ,  , has now termed   as 'naive'. 

 Shivpal while attending the marriage function of SP leader Lal Singh Tomar's son, said,"It's his (Akhilesh Yadav) naiveness that   had suffered a humiliating defeat in the assembly elections." 
 
 He said prior to the assembly elections, a major political decision of forming an alliance with the Congress was taken by Akhilesh independently and without consulting senior party leaders. "Had we fought the elections alone, we could have fared better. It's the same Samajwadi Party that had formed its government in 2012 with full majority. Reducing to just 47 seats is something shameful," he said.
 
 When asked about the proposed 'Secular Front', Shivpal reiterated that the main objective of floating the front was to restore the lost honour of Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav). 
 
 It may be mentioned that on May 3, Shivpal had made statement in Etawah, saying, "He (Akhilesh) had given three months time, and now I am giving him three months time. Either, he should step down as party president, or I will form a Secular Front." 
 
 Two days after making this announcement, Shivpal had said, "His elder sibling and SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav will head the Secular Front though latter had denied. 
 
 Also, the same day, without taking any name, Shivpal had lashed out at his cousin Ram Gopal Yadav by describing him as 'Shakuni Mama' and advising him to first read the Gita. "What he (Ram Gopal Yadav) has done, only Shakuni Mama can do... it's my request to him to read Gita first", Shivpal had said. 
 
 After poll debacle in UP assembly elections, Shivpal is asking his nephew and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav to step down from the post of the party president.
