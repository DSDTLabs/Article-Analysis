Madurai: The transport strike called by employee unions of state transport corporations left many people stranded as employees started withdrawing buses from the road, and started taking them back to depots. In the evening, frantic passengers started running to catch last bus services leaving the bus terminal.  Though the talks between transport corporations and state government were underway throughout the day, the strike caught the general public unaware. People did not realize that buses were being pulled away gradually and returning to the depots. “All of a sudden, buses started coming without destination boards at Periyar bus stand. I managed to catch hold of a packed autorickshaw to reach home”, said A Devi, a housewife from Nagamalai Pudukottai. People coming from interior villages were worst affected as buses bound to their villages were terminated at the home depots situated in between. R Vasudevan from CITU, one among the secretaries of the transport federation said that they wanted to take out strike later in the night. “When news started leaking out in the media, the strike started spontaneously with crew members taking away buses to their depots. Almost half of the buses returned to their depots by 7pm and rest of buses returned later at night”, he said. Long bound buses like ones bound to Trichy and Thanjavur from Mattuthavani MGR bus terminal that left the terminal with passengers was terminated at their destinations, according to union sources. TNSTC, Madurai has 7,000 employees with a bus fleet of 1,100 in the city. When put together as region Virudhunagar, Madurai and Dindigul districts, there are 2,566 bus fleet and 15,000 employees.
