Nagpur: Even as the city has recorded 190   positive cases and 28 deaths from April 1 till date, the three-month-long peak season of the disease is still two months away.

 Until now in the country, H1N1 was being conceived as the virus non-conductive above 30 degree Celsius. However, this year has hit the entire concept for a six.
 
 An official of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) health department said, “The current figures are not unexpected. The disease was uncontrollable during peak summer when such viruses merely exist. Instead, monsoon provides conductive atmosphere when any kind of virus can easily spread. So, the figure had to be high.”
 
 As per the past records, over 80% of the annual swine flu cases were witnessed between December and February because of low temperatures.
 
 But the story this year was slightly different. Swine Flu was fairly existent in the months right when the city kept featuring in the list of top four hottest districts of the country between April and May.
 
 This year, swine flu was non-existent before March. But as March ended, there were 17 positive cases and two deaths due to the virus. In the next 15 days, the death toll rose to six. By May, there were 63 positive cases and 15 deaths. That was the same time when the maximum temperature of the city kept hovering between 42 and 46 degrees.
 
 Intensivist Dr Deepak Jeshwani said, “We have learnt a lesson that the virus has mutated to an extent that it will be existent throughout the year and the coming winter will record more cases.”
