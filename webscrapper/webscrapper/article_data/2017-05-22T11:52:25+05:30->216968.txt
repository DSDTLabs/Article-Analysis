 is all set with its new historical drama ' ' and it will mark the debut of veteran actress   on the small screen at the age of 73.
 
  'Aarambh' is about 'gender inequality' and showcases how Indian society became patriarchal over the period of time. The basic topic this show highlights is the matriarchal society during Dravidian clans.
  
  
 
  
  At the launch of 'Aarambh',   spoke exclusively to Timesofindia.com and here's what he has to say about his role, working with Tanuja and more.
  
  
 
  
  A: The role of Varundev is super interesting. 'Aarambh' is a historical drama and a fictional series. We are showing the clash of two civilizations. Varundev's character was distinct as he had his own thought process. When I heard the entire narration I was totally convinced. He has that special power of knowing the future which I really liked.
  
  
 
  
  A: Well, the only things which are similar are firstly, it is written by K. V. Vijayendra Prasad and secondly the VFX level may be similar but the storyline is completely different. We can't compare it with 'Baahubali'.
  
  
 
  
  A: See 50% yes makers do pick up story line from movies but the rest is original content. I feel that is very normal to be inspired from cinema.
  
  
 
  
  A: We have been watching Tanuja for years on screen and it was like a dream to work with her. Karthika is a known name of South Indian industry and was absolutely fantastic sharing screen space with her as well.
