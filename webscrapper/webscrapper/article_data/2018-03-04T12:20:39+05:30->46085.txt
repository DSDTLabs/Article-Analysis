He who draws inspiration also inspires! So when  , the strapping young member of Bhoomi and also son of frontman,  , started growing his beard and mane for what he thought would make him a rockstar, he had no clue that that he would end up looking like Pritam, Bollywood’s most trusted and controversial hitmaker. Only this February, the young musician travelled to   and stepped out looking every bit the Bolly composer. Later, he even posted a picture of his yak ride on   with a tongue-incheek caption: “Anticlimax: When you strike a rockstar pose, but end up looking like   instead”.

 With friends calling him up to say they wouldn’t have realised it was him had they not known Arjyesh, he went on to upload a picture of Pritam on the same post and caption it: “Hello, I’d like to report an identity theft.. No.. Not song theft, IDENTITY THEFT...!!!!” But the hullabaloo about the youngster’s new look didn’t go down too well with daddy, who didn’t seem to feel that looking like Pritam was an achievement. Papa clearly told Arjyesh to get rid off the look, lest it would rock his boat. Right now in Harishchandrapur, Malda, to celebrate a five-day Holi in their native town, Arjyesh has shaved off his beard and is back to being his own self. Cutting the long mane — and story — short, Arjyesh has now vouched not to repeat the look. If Pritam was around, what would he have said? ‘Yahi umar hai kar le galti se mistake’, methinks.
