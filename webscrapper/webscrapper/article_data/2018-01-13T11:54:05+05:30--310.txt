MADURAI: Steps are being taken to optimise the use of the two launch pads in  , and increase the frequency of rocket launches for the benefit of the people of country, said director of Isro’s propulsion complex (IPRC),  , S   on Friday.

 Pandian, who arrived at the Madurai airport on Friday evening, said the launch of the PSLV-C40 had added another feather to the cap of the Indian Space Research Organisation ( ). The   satellite which was launched on Friday will help in town and city planning. “We are not competing with any country on space research, but want to ensure that the people of India benefit from our research,” he said.
 
 He said that the Isro propulsion complex in Mahendragiri had played a significant role in the launch of the PSLV-C40 rocket as the liquid stages of the rocket were tested here. IPRC was also doing research on semi-cryogenic facilities, he said. Research on jet associated tests which would help in slow descent of the spacecraft was underway in Mahendragiri, he said.
 
 Indian space research norms were more flexible when compared to many other countries, a reason why satellites of other countries were also being accommodated in the India rockets, he said adding that the analytics were initiated as soon as a request for a launch was received and it also helped the missions economically.
 
 Pandian said that one-day workshop for mediapersons would be held at Mahendragiri, to showcase the work being undertaken there.
