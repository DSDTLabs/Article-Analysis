BATHINDA: A Class X dropout who was stalking a Class IX girl allegedly attacked her with a sword just inside the school gates in   on Tuesday morning. The girl somehow managed to ward off the attack, but suffered cuts on her arms in the process. 

 Police said accused   Singh (18) has been stalking the 14- year-old girl for quite sometime. On Tuesday morning, he tried to speak to her near the school gates. When the girl refused to hear him out, Jasbir lunged at the girl with a sharp edged weapon, police said. On hearing the commotion, teachers and students moved to help the girl, but Jasbir escaped. The girl was taken to the civil hospital. Sources said he had an altercation with the girl a few days ago.
 
 Talwandi Sabo deputy superintendent of police   and   station house officer   said, “A case of attempt to murder, wrongful restraint and criminal intimidation has been registered against Jasbir. No member of the boy’s family was at home after the incident. We are trying to arrest him.” In her statement to the police, the girl said she had just entered the school when Jasbir followed her inside and tried to attack her face with a sharp-edged weapon. As she put up both her arms to cover her face, her arms got slashed and her clothes, especially her salwaar, got drenched in blood.
 
  A doctor at the civil hospital said she was out of danger.
