NEW DELHI: The Centre will soon install ‘Justice Clocks’ — LED message display boards — in all 24 high courts to show the daily rate of disposal of cases, the number of pending cases and the individual rank of each of these courts.

 
 The idea, floated by Prime Minister   last year, to create public awareness in judicial matters, is set to be later implemented in all subordinate courts across the country.
 
 The aim is also to create a competition among the courts and also rank them according to performance, when it comes to disposal of cases, junior law minister P P Chaudhary said. 
 
 
  
 
 A model of this ‘clock’ was first installed in the Delhi office of the justice department, which comes under the law ministry, last year. 
 
 Apart from highlighting citizen-centric services, the clock installed in the capital’s Jaisalmer House provides information on district and subordinate courts.
