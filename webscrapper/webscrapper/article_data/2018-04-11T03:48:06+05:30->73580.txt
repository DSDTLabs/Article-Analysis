NAVI MUMBAI: The Uran police have arrested the driver of a container trailer who had stolen two tonnes of aluminum coils worth Rs 3.50 lakh out of 24-tonne consignment imported from China. 

 The driver, Farooq Ahmad Jakir  , had committed the crime on March 24 during transit from   to Uran.
 
  The stolen goods are yet to be recovered and the cops suspect that there is a bigger gang involved. 
 
 Inspector (crime)   said, "Hussain was transporting the consignment from   port to a Chembur based industry at their factory at   in Uran. But Hussain tampered the seal and removed two tonnes of coil and delivered the rest."
 
 But as the consignment weighed less than the ordered amount, the company's officer inquired with Beijing supplier who claimed they had dispatched the ordered amount. JNPT office too, confirmed the amount when it arrived at the port. The officer then suspected Hussain who was assigned delivering the consignment.
