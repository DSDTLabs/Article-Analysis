PATIALA: AAP candidates contesting   have devised a noble way to attract the crowds, especially women, in its   these days.

 They have hired the services of folk singers, ‘mirasis’ and ‘dhadhis’ (balladeers) to perform ‘Jaago’, a ritual before weddings in Punjab, during their campaigns. Dr Balbir Singh, AAP candidate from Patiala (urban) constituency, is among those taking out ‘jaago’ to reach out to voters.
 
 Dr Balbir picked up the idea from his party colleague and singer-turned-politician  , AAP candidate from  .
 
 AAP candidates have their own justification of making changes to ‘jaago’. Dr Balbir said, “We solicit a clean community and the society. Hence we have picked up ‘jaago’. For us ‘jaago’ means creating awareness and awakening of the masses through songs. Dev had initially got it recorded, we picked up this concept and our local singers are using the same lyrics.”
 
 He said party’s women volunteers would take out the ‘jaago’ procession in the localities at night and it would be followed by their address at nukkad meetings.
 
 Simran Kaur, a resident of Old Baradari in Patiala, said, “At least, these lyrics are decent. They talk about drug abuse or own party agenda rather than abusing others. Voters are smart enough to understand. Hence it could be a method to attract voters and not to influence them.”
