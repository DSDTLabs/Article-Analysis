THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The  , which is funding the second phase of Kerala State Transport Project, has agreed to the state's demand to execute construction of 82-km Punalur-Ponkunnam road in the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) mode. In   mode the contractor will be given funds as a lump sum grand. 

  minister G Sudhakaran said that the World Bank has also accepted state's proposals for construction of Thiruvalla bypass and renovation of roads in Thiruvalla town.
 
 Sources in the PWD said the World Bank delegation, which recently visited the state, has expressed satisfaction over the progress of the project. 
 
 Now, the state will have to complete the entire work within two years as April 2020 is the deadline for its completion. The World Bank has informed that it would not allow extension of the deadline.
 
 As per the original plan, the construction of Punalur-Ponkunnam road was to be executed in hybrid-annuity mode. With state and central governments promoting more PPP models, execution of a   could have given a leverage for the state. However, the project failed to get any bidders. The project lagged for several years until the state government proposed to the World Bank that it be executed in the EPC mode.
 
 The L&T has prepared DPR of the project, which is estimated to cost around Rs 750 crore. PWD minister said that the department has plans to begin the work by November. The construction of Thiruvalla bypass too will begin by November, he said. The Thiruvalla bypass project ran into trouble due to a faulty DPR. The government then cancelled the project and decided to invite a fresh tender.
 
 Sudhakaran said that works for the Kazhakkoottam-Adoor safe corridor are not progressing in the expected pace.
