Being someone who has always had an appetite for business along with her film career, actor   is set to create another mark in her career spanning 15 years. Lara, who began her career in the glamour industry, has closely followed emerging trends in beauty and skincare. Now as she turns 40 next month, she is tapping into that experience to create her own skincare range of products under the brand name ARIAS.

 The range is scheduled to hit stores in the later half of the year.   has been actively involved at every stage. She has partnered with research laboratories in   and with credible dermatologists specialising in skincare, and will present what she assures is a world-class product with visible results.
 
 Talking about her new skincare line, Lara says, “For years, ever since I was a model, I would be asked about what I did for my skin. So extending my own brand to include skincare seems almost organic to my progression. The product range has been carefully created and focuses on age management and control in the most effective manner. The range is created using the best ingredients from around the world that have been proven to show results. My vision has been to make sure we offer world-class products that are readily accessible to the Indian consumer at affordable prices.”
 
 Meanwhile, Lara has also been busy with her projects as a producer. In addition, she will make her foray into television as a judge on the dance reality show, High Fever: Dance Ka Naya Tevar, where contestants from across the country will pair up and showcase their dancing abilities. It is for the first time that participating duos will not just be couples, but also relatives, friends and siblings. Later in the year, Lara will also mentor Miss Diva participants; the winner will represent India at Miss Universe.
