PUNE: India No. 1   produced a terrific display of shotmaking as he overwhelmed local wildcard entrant   6-3, 6-4 in an opening round match of the $560,000 Tata Open Maharashtra here on Tuesday.

 Bhambri, World No. 118, broke Kadhe thrice in the first set and twice in the second to run away with the match in an hour and 15 minutes. Kadhe, ranked 606, tried to match his rival shot for shot but a poor first-serve percentage proved to be his undoing.
 
 Three double faults in the ninth game of the first st, which led to a break for Bhambri, were an indication of the 23-year-old’s struggles. Bhambri, on the other hand, toyed with the local favourite with his deep ground strokes. “Arjun didn’t serve well, especially in the first set,” Kadhe’s coach   said. “He was also hitting shots at waist high level, which is Yuki’s strength. It was throughout the match, probably he didn’t realise it quick enough.”
 
 
 
 Sumit Nagal’s impressive run in the ATP 250 Series hard court event came to an end as he went down 6-3, 6-3 to another qualifier, Ilya Ivashka of Belarus. The 20-year-old from Jhajjar, playing his first main draw match of an   event after coming through the qualifying rounds, was broken in the fourth and eighth games of the first set.
