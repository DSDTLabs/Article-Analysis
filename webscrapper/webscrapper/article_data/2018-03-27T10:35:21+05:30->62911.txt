AGRA: The   ( ) is set to launch a campaign against hospitals and marriage homes operating in violation to the civic body norms.
 
 According to AMC officials, at least 300 hospitals and marriage homes are operating from residential premises. They don’t have parking facility, and thus, vehicles are parked on roads causing traffic jams.
  
 Mayor   said, “Large number of hospitals are operating without AMC’s approval, and don’t follow the mandatory civic body norms. Hospitals can be seen operating in residential premises almost in every part of the city. At several places, parking spaces have been turned into wards or waiting area and vehicles are being parked on the roads causing traffic problem. These hospitals also do not follow standard norms for the disposal of medical waste which is hazardous to public health.”
  
 “Similarly, majority of marriage homes in the city are not registered with AMC, but has been operating for the past several years. They dump garbage heaps in the open, which ultimately litters roads. Besides, they pay nothing to AMC for carrying out commercial activities. We have decided to run a city-wide campaign against such hospitals and marriage homes. If required, we will ask the   to take action against the hospitals operating in residential premises,” he said.
