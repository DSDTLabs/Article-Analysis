Noida:  , the upgraded online service for getting new vehicles registered, will eventually start in Ghaziabad, Hapur and Bulandshahr on January 27, officials have said.

 The Vahan and Sarathi services were supposed to have been launched across Uttar Pradesh districts on August 20 last year. It was delayed to September-end because of the transfer of some officials but got postponed further following technical problems faced by BSNL in creating infrastructure for fast Internet. For so long, the Vahan 4.0 service had been restricted to Gautam Budh Nagar, where it was launched on November 16.
 
 The service includes online application for a new vehicle, registration certificates, issuing of no objection certificates, change of address in the certificates, duplicate certificates, transfer of ownership, renewal of registration and so on.
 
 Officials said that now that the Internet snag had been fixed, the additional RTOs of the three districts would undergo training in the new software.
 
 “The ARTOs (administration) and data base assistants (DBAs) of these districts will undergo training in the new software. The service will start in Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr and Hapur from January 27,” said Ajay Tripathi, the regional transport officer (RTO) of Ghaziabad region. The Ghaziabad RTO region includes four districts — Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Hapur and Bulandshar. 
 
 Officials said usual issuing of licences would be hampered until work on the software upgrade was complete.
