DURBAN: The six One-day Internationals, followed by the three T20Is against India should give South African skipper   is some respite on flat tracks on offer now, a far cry from the kind of wickets his team wanted during the three Test matches that concluded last month.

 
 
 
 Coming into the Test series with a formidable pace attack, the South Africans also had to gear up and face India's own set of pacers, one that Faf believes was "surprising".
 
 
 
 "It was bowling-friendly conditions in the Test series but I was surprised how consistent the Indian seamers were," he said in Durban, the focus of the format having shifted but the memories of a well- contested Test series still fresh. "They were very consistent and it showed us there is a lot of strength in their bowling department," the skipper added.
 
 Of the five-man pace attack that India unleashed on South Africa at the Wanderers, the bowler who left Faf 's team surprised the most was  , the 24-year-old who made his debut in the series.
 
 "He was a surprise for us from a Test selection point of view, obviously because you had more experienced bowlers in the squad," Faf said, indicating he was surprised at first that   did not play in the first Test.
 
 "Ishant didn't play originally, but I thought Bumrah was very impressive. A guy who plays ODI cricket, and he is obviously a really good ODI bowler, but I was really impressed with his consistency (in the Tests). He didn't bowl a lot of bad balls, which shows that he is someone for the future," Faf added.
