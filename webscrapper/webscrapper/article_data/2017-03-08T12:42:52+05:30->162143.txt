 gets disturbed to see Daksh around her. She begins to feel he is following her all around and begins to faint when Shivaay catches hold of her. Shivaay assures her that nothing would happen to her as long as he is around. Anika hugs him.

 Priyanka and Ranveer's roka ceremony starts. While Daksh stares at Anika, Shivaay holds her hand. Shivaay also throws the plate with papaya that is given as a part of the ritual to Priyanka. He tells everyone that he saw ants in it.
 
  
  
 Later, Shivaay reprimands Ranveer for not taking care of Priyanka the way he expected him to. He tells him how Papaya is not supposed to be taken by a pregnant woman and that he didn't stop others from giving it to Ptiyanka. Ranveer apologizes to him.
 
 Daksh overhears their conversation and decides to play this as a trump card. 
 
 Anika sees a dream where Daksh has tied her. She wakes up terribly shocked and petrified of him. Shivaay assures her that he would not let Daksh do anything to her.
