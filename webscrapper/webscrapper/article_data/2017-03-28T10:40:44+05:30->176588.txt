PUNE: The audacity with which traffic rules are violated came to the fore again on Sunday night, when two men driving an SUV physically assaulted a woman traffic constable in  .

 While the suspects fled the scene, they were apprehended later in the night.

 When the constable stopped the vehicle, the two men in the car started hurling obscenities at him. The lady constable saw the commotion and joined her colleague, asking the men to step out of the vehicle.The suspects then directed their profanity-laced tirade at her.“One of them even kicked and molested her,“   added.
 
 As onlookers started gathering, the constables asked the police control room to send reinforcements. However, taking advantage of the crowd, the suspects fled.
 
 Police officials said they are checking if Vanjari has a previous criminal record.
