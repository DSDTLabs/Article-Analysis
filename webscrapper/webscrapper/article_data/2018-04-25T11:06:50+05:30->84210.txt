Filmmaker Kaushik Ganguly’s upcoming film   tells an uncommon tale of love. The film focuses on two characters — a successful lawyer, Mr Mitra, played by   — who lives a happy and content married life. 
And there is Miss Sen, played by  , who seeks Mr Mitra’s help in a serious and complicated legal case. The film is a search for friendship and love through various perspectives, or drishtikone. CT caught up with the director and the lead actors of the film to talk about their experiences of working in the film.
 
  Before Praktan, for 14 years the audience didn’t see Ritu and Bumba come together on screen. They were very much interested to see their performance and chemistry. And this time too, the audience will not be disappointed. Overall, it was a great experience making this film as we are presenting a never-seen-before love story.
 
  Every actor wants to work with  . He creates magic on screen. Working with him for the first time was simply memorable. When Kaushikda narrated the story of Drishtikone, I knew this film will be the one that will bring out the actors in both Ritu and me. 
 
  This is the first time I am working with Kaushik Ganguly and it was a memorable experience. When he narrated the script, I realised it could bring out a different side of me. It is a very mature love story and shows the Prosenjit-Ritu pairing in a very different way.
