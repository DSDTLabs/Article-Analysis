Shimmering chaniya  , thumping   beats and lots of fun and frolic — the garba spirit is at its peak in the city. At two colourful dandiya bashes hosted by different ladies clubs in the city, the pretty   turned up dressed to the hilt their in colourful festive finery. And even as DJs belted out everything from raas garba to the latest dandiya remixes, revellers showed off their moves in style. Those who weren’t on the dance floor were seen soaking in the garba atmosphere and bonding with each other over chatpata food and garma-garam gossip.
