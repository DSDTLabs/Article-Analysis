JAIPUR: The ruling   and the opposition   made last-ditch efforts on Thursday to woo voters in Dholpur assembly constituency, for which election campaigning would cease by Friday evening. Chief electoral officer (CEO)   too held meetings in Dholpur on Thursday to oversee preparations for the polling that would take place on Sunday. 

 Chief minister Vasundhara Raje, who had been camping in Dholpur for election campaigning, met members of different communities that play a deciding role in elections for the assembly constituency. BJP candidate Shobharani's community, Kushwahs, turned up in large numbers to meet Raje and assured support to the party on Thursday.
 
 To counter the ruling party's final-stage campaign strategies, Congress state president   undertook a roadshow in Dholpur on Thursday evening. The event witnessed an impressive turnout of locals for the nearly 4-km stretch from Kali Mai Mandir to Town Choki in the city.
