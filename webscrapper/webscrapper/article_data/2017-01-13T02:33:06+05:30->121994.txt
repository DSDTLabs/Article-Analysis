NEW DELHI: At a time when government is planning to increase the duration of   leave from existing 12 to 26 weeks,   working on ad hoc basis at Delhi’s government hospitals claim they are told to quit job to plan a baby.

 A senior resident at   in  , who is seven and half months pregnant, claims to be one such victim. She cited services rules for not speaking out. But her husband and father-in-law, both doctors, said they have decided to take up the matter with the highest authorities.
 
 “I know we can sustain our family without her working. But how do you tell a professional to sit home because that’s what women were supposed to do always,” the senior resident’s husband wrote on the Facebook page of Federation of  , on Thursday.
 
 He blamed the AAP–led Delhi government for alleged indifference against women doctors and their concerns. Some other doctors too, shared similar problems in getting maternity leave sanctioned at their hospitals run by the state government.
 
 “I was also refused leaves. But I didn’t give my resignation.. and went on leave for six months. Now, I have joined back and am regular too. Still, they have not replied whether six months would be counted for experience and if I will get a salary,” wrote a doctor.
 
 When asked, medical superintendent of the hospital Dr Subhash Seth refused to make any comment. He, however, added that granting six months leave is practically not possible as senior residents are hired on ad-hoc basis for 89 days only.
 
 “Ad hoc employees are hired for 89 days and based on their performance the contract is renewed for the same period. How can we grant six month leave for 89-day job,” Dr Seth told TOI.
