 Thefts of vehicles are a routine affair in the city, but when they happen on festive season, the victims suffer a jolt, particularly those who are from middle class. At least 10 motorcycle thefts are reported in the city during the festive season, the police said. 
 
 Thief in one of the complaints has been identified by the police. The burglars mostly stole two-wheelers during day and night hours. The police had busted gangs involved in vehicle thefts in the recent past, but there is no letup. 
 
 “Thefts are carried out by professional gang who sell the stolen vehicles. Many times youths also steal motorcycles which they later abandon once the fuel is over. The complaints are not registered in the second instance,” a police officer said.
 
 The professional gangs separate the vehicle parts and then sell them. This makes it difficult for the police to identify the thieves. Detections in the recent past revealed that gangs of thieves from outside the city were found involved in vehicle thefts in Surat.
 
 “It is a serious matter that vehicles are being stolen regularly from the city. We have a special squad in crime branch to focus on detection of vehicle theft cases. Police have been cracking many cases of the vehicle thefts at regular intervals. There is need for us to strengthen our efforts further,” joint commissioner of police, traffic and crime, Surat, S G Bhati said.
