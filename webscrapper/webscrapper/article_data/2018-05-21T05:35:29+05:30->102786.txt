YAVATMAL: Despite efforts by the district administration, the drinking   in   city flared up on Sunday. People came out on the streets in the scorching sun, and blocked roads at several places, bringing traffic to a grinding halt for over four hours. An employee of Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran was allegedly beaten up by some protesters.

 Residents of Old Wadgaon area staged a road blockade on the road leading to Arni, while residents of village Bhosa blocked the National Highway between Bori and Tulzapur.
 
 The agitators, men, women and children of all ages, had only one demand, ‘We want water’. The agitators sat on the road with empty pots and shouted slogans against the government and district administration.
 
 Deputy chairman of state legislative council Manikrao Thakre rushed to the site and tried to pacify the angry mob. He said that he was keeping a close watch over the situation, and tried thrice to get more details from the administration, but the response was not satisfactory.
 
 When one of the employees of Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP), the water supplying agency, appeared on the scene and made some loose statements, the mob thrashed him. The police have registered criminal offences against over 150 agitators under various sections of IPC and Mumbai Police Act.
 
 A municipal council member, Dinesh Goharkar, alleged that chief officer Anil Adhagale is ignoring their demand to increase tankers in all wards.
 
 “With 60-70 localities in each prabhag, it is difficult to deliver water to all areas by a single tanker,” he said, adding even municipal council employees were now supplying water.
 
 “MJP has spent lakhs to lay a pipeline between MIDC filtration plant and   storage tank. But the entire exercise has been rendered futile, Goharkar said, due to a fault in the pipeline.
 
 The council has acquired 12 tanks with capacity of 24,000 litres from Shirdi Temple Trust, but they too are inadequate to cater to the water needs of the people.
