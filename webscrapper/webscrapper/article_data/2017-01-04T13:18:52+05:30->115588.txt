NAGPUR: 20-year-old  , who hawks vegetbales, was thrashed by four people, including dreaded goon, identified as   for refusing to pay Rs them 8k per month, near Ajni bridge on Monday. 

 Tiwari, who threatened Jaiswal, who hails from Madhya Pradesh, snatched Rs800 from his pocket before fleeing from the spot. Jaiswal registered an FIR against the goons at the Dhantoli police station. Tiwari is yet to be nabbed.
 
 Apart from Tiwari, who has several offences against him from the last three years, his accomplices were identified as Shubham Uike (19),   (21) and Raju Ahir (46). Tiwari’s brother Bablu, who has murder charges against him, too is a suspect in the case.
 
 “The goons had also asked Jaiswal to pay them Rs300 daily for their expenses,” said cops.
 
 PI RA Mane said they have recorded the statements of other vegetable vendors too and hope to gather more evidences against the culprits.
 
 There are several such markets in the city where hard-core criminals extort money from small businessmen. Following such incidents, CP K Venkatesh had ordered crime branch and police station level officers to make a list of such extortionists.
 
 “Local officers would share their contact numbers with vegetable vendors so that they could directly discuss such activities with them,” said Venkatesh. 
 
 In an earlier case, three vegetable vendors smashed criminal Ashish Raut’s head in Bhudhwari market, just a few metres away from the Sakkardara police station in September 2016. Raut had been extorting money from local businessmen, including vegetable vendors.
