BHUBANESWAR: The BJB Autonomous College, one of the top colleges of the state, will submit a proposal to the state government to help it run regular postgraduate courses.

 Now the college is providing eight PG courses in the self-financing mode. Three educational trusts are running seven PG courses in public-private partnership (PPP) mode, while the college offers Masters in Social Work.
 
 But the college has no regular PG courses. "We will give a proposal to the higher education department to set up seven PG departments in the college. I will also raise the issue at our   meeting to be held on January 29," said  , principal of the college.
 
 He said they will request the government to help the college set up two PG courses, physics and chemistry, from the science stream and five courses - English, Odia, economics, political science and MA in education in humanities.
 
 If the college gets the regular PG departments, official sources said, the government will sanction funds for it like it does for universities. It will also create permanent faculty posts and other infrastructure for the departments. It will help the college to get unitary university status, said the sources.
 
 Lagnajit Patra, second year student of MAJMC (self-financing course) of the college, said the regular department will be very helpful for students.
 
 Dhiren Kumar Patnaik, director of higher education, said his department will discuss about the issue after getting the proposal from the autonomous college.
 
 Around 24 colleges in the state have PG departments. These are Vikram Deb Autonomous College, Jeypore, Government Autonomous College, Rourkela, and   (SCS) Autonomous College, Puri.
