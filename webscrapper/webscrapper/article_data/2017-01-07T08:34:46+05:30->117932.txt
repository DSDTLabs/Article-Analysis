MANALI: The crowd at the hill town’s Winter Carnival this year seems to be far less as compared to previous years, thanks to lack of marketing to attract tourists from other states. Organizers have failed to meet their objective of pulling in tourists during the lean season. However, the   said they had tried their best to reach out to the maximum number of people by holding several competitions, but it has not given importance to advertizing in states from where the majority of tourists arrive.

 In the name of advertizing and online marketing, the carnival committee has an insignificant website which is not frequently updated. A Facebook page having nearly 9,000 likes too is not being updated, but organizers believe these are the most   outside the state. Winter Carnival organizing committee vice-chairman HR Bairwa said they had worked hard to advertize the carnival this year. “We have advertized in other states as well, and stressed on marketing through social media. We have also conducted auditions for Winter Queen Beauty pageant and   in Chandigarh. The stature of the carnival is increasing every year, and we are working hard,” he repeated.
 
 However,  , a tourist from Chandigarh, said she came to know about the Winter Carnival only after she reached Manali on Thursday. “I didn’t see any poster, ads, or anything on television regarding this carnival. My husband asked me if I am interested in watching the programmes, but we gave up the idea after seeing very few people at the event.”
