PATNA: The regional office of Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) recently issued a fresh circular to all its affiliated schools, allowing them to open shops on premises to sell NCERT books and stationery items required by students. The   had in April asked schools to not run as “commercial establishments” and stop selling books and uniforms on the premises.

 The fresh circular issued to heads of all CBSE schools of the region last week read, “Schools are allowed to place indent for purchase of NCERT books directly through its website for distribution among their students and for this purpose, a tuck shop may be opened inside the premises of the schools.” 
 
 CBSE regional officer Lakhan Lal Meena said the tuck shop is only for sell of stationery items and NCERT books. “Books of other publishers cannot be sold on school campuses. The schools are required to sell books at the original price. It will be convenient for parents and students to purchase all the books from their respective schools at a fair price instead of frequenting book shops,” Meena said.
 
 Principal of Baldwin Academy Rajiv Ranjan said they are yet to take a final decision as the CBSE may tweak its guidelines again. “The board may come up with another circular. We are not a business planner. Let’s wait and watch,” he added.
 
 Sharat Kumar Singh, principal of Litera Valley School, said since the board has allowed opening of tuck shops, students can purchase books from the school campus. We will ask India Book Centre to distribute the NCERT books among the students on the school premises. The school officials will just monitor the exercise as our main focus is on academics.”
