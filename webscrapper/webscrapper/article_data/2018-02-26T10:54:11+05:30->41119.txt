THANJAVUR: A case was registered against five men for the murder of a 48-year-old woman, allegedly hacked to death, near Thanjavur on Saturday. Thanjavur Taluk police are on the lookout for them.

  Kannan, son of the victim,  , had reportedly got into an argument with one of the accused Suresh when both were sitting near a temple in   on Saturday evening. 
 
 The argument was over Kannan spitting, which allegedly fell on Suresh, a truck owner. An enraged Suresh and along with truck driver Sekar, relative Paneerselvam and two other unidentified men confronted Sathish over the incident. 
 
 However, the public intervened and pacified them. 
 
 On Saturday night, Suresh, along with four others, allegedly went to Kannanâ€™s residence and got into a quarrel with Indira Gandhi, her husband   and mother-in-law Sambalammal, as Kannan was not at home at that time. The quarrel soon turned violent. 
 
 Indira Gandhi tried to intervene but Suresh, along with the other four, attacked her, Sambalammal and Govindharaj with a sickle. 
 
 All three were taken to Thanjavur Government Medical College Hospital, where Indira Gandhi succumbed to injuries, while Govindharaj and Sambalammal were receiving treatment.
