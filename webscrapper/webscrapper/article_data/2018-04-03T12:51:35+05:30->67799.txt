NAGPUR: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC) on Monday took suo motu cognizance of a letter pointing out towards several vacancies and other staff at city-based   (CGIT), which is also referred to as labour court.

 A division bench comprising justices   and   appointed   as amicus curiae and asked him to draft a comprehensive petition within two weeks.
 
 The Union ministry of labour and employment and Union ministry of law and judiciary, through their respective secretaries, have been made respondents in the case.
 
 The letter was sent by CGIT presiding officer who was recently appointed, stating that he was facing problems on account of lack of infrastructure and staff. Therefore, he canâ€™t dispose of the huge pendency of cases.
 
 Before him, the post was vacant for over two years, thus leading to pendency of cases and harassment to hundreds of litigants, particularly poor labourers, as they were kept waiting.
 
 The court flayed the government for not appointing judges and other staff at such a big tribunal.
