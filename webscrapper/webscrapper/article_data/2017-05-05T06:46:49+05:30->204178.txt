BENGALURU: Highlighting the role onions played in enhancing taste, Bengaluru development minister   on Thursday said that the government would welcome the   (Iskcon) and women self-help groups for providing food for Indira Canteens if they agreed to use the vegetable.

 “We'll welcome Iskcon's participation provided they're ready to use onions, needed to make canteen food tasty for the common man,“ said George.
 
 Pointing out that kitchen would be decentralised,   added, “Kitchen facilities will be set up in every ward of the city. The government has also invited women self-help groups to bid for contracts.“ The minister said that, based on suggestions from the public, government had already decided on including idli and vada on the canteen menu. “The menu for lunch, dinner and breakfast will be finalised in the coming days,“ George said.
 
 He added that the 10-member committee that is working on the project would also be looking at a uniform design for the canteens.
