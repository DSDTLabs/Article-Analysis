LUDHIANA: Even six months after the ban on  , their use can still be seen in commercial vehicles as well as buses and trucks. The   ( ) took the decision to ban the manufacture, sale, and fittings of pressure horns, and other sound emitting devices in the state, but truck, bus, and commerical vehicle owners flout rules, making driving difficult for other drivers.

 In a notice issued in September, PPCB said ‘anyone manufacturing, selling, purchasing, fitting, and using these devices will face imprisonment up to six years after conviction or a fine of Rs 5,000 per day in line with the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. PPCB has removed pressure horns from around 6,000 buses, trucks, and other vehicles across the state. “We have set up checkposts at several places and removed horns from many vehicles. Challans are also imposed on defaulters,” said ACP Traffic  , adding that an awareness programme was also started at several places, including colleges, schools, and universities.
 
 The data provided by PPCB shows that the regional office had removed more than 1,200 illegal horns, Ludhiana being top on the list with maximum violators. A traffic official told TOI: “These horns are either used by the young generation, or by politicians or persons having political connections.”
 
 According to the safety limit set by   (WHO), long-term exposure to noise levels from 85-95db can lead to hearing loss. “Pressure horns are so irritating and disturbing, especially on highways. Despite the ban, truck drivers openly use these horns on the highway. They are really dangerous,” said   (32), a resident of New Model Town.
 
 Some commuters said bus drivers use pressure horns in front of the traffic police, but no action was being taken against them. “Bus drivers openly flaunt their pressure horns outside the bus stand where a checkpost is set up. But police take no action against them,” said   (52), a resident of Camp Area.
