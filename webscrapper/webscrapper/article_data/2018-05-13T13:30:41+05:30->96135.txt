TRICHY: The move to relocate Gandhi market to the outskirts of the city has received a shot in the arm with a majority of the trade unions which have significant workforce expressing interest in it. Earlier, all the trade unions had locked horns with the district administration over the move to shift the congested market to the integrated vegetable market complex in Kallikudi.

 The agriculture marketing and agriculture business department has been distributing applications to allot shops for wholesale traders in the newly-built integrated market. As announced, the district administration will be implementing the ban on entry of heavy vehicles carrying vegetables to the Gandhi market area from June 1. 
 
 On Thursday, three major trade unions, DMK’s   (LPF), VCK’s   (LLF) and CPM’s Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), erected their respective flag masts at the integrated market signifying their indirect approval for the relocation. “Establishing a flag mast of a trade union in the integrated market locality is like labourers giving No Objection Certificate (NOC) for Gandhi Market relocation. Labourers may have felt job insecurity since their reluctance to move to the new market facility may push the traders to employ local people at the new market,” K Suresh, district secretary,   (CPI), said. Peeved at the traffic congestion recurring in the Gandhi market, local people have for long been demanding the relocation. 
 
 Being a major trade union with most labourers enrolled in the onion market, the flag mast of LPF in Kallikudi integrated market was seen by officials as a positive development. “Our intention behind establishing a flag mast at Kallikudi vegetable market is to ensure employment for existing labourers of Gandhi market even after the relocation,” R Sampath, district secretary, CITU, told TOI. Most of the trade unions, including the communist-backed ones, had been protesting the relocation of Gandhi market since early 2016.
