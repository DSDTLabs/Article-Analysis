People remember their birth language even if they haven't had the chance to speak it, according to a new study. Language learning at early stage can be subconsciously retained even when no   of the early experience remains, a study said.

 The subconscious knowledge can then be tapped to speed up learning of the pronunciation of sounds of the lost tongue. Scientists, including those from   in  , found that decades after their adoption, Korean adoptees are better in pronouncing Korean sounds than control participants, even if they were only a few months old at the moment of their adoption.
 
 Their results show that babies start with the learning and storing of   much earlier than was otherwise known. The experiment involved 29 Korean-born Dutch speakers and an equal-sized native Dutch-speaking control group. Throughout a two-week period of training, the adoptees were asked to identify three Korean consonants and then to try and reproduce them -the sounds were unlike anything in Dutch.
 
 All of the spoken productions collected in the experiment were then rated by Korean listeners. Adoptees' attempts at articulating the correct sound improved significantly across the training period than control participants.“One of the most interesting findings was that no difference showed in the learning results of those Korean-born participants adopted under six months of age and those adopted after the age of seventeen months,“ said Mirjam Broersma, language scientist at Radboud University.
 
 The study was published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.
