NASHIK: The minister of state for urban development   will be conducting a meeting with civic officials on Tuesday to take a call regarding increasing the rent of  's ( ) shops as per ready reckoner rates. 

 The civic administration had proposed that the rent should be increased as per the ready reckoner of the respective areas instead of a certain percentage that was bare minimum and did not fetch enough revenue for the NMC.
 
 But some shopkeepers objected to it and wrote to   Seema Hiray. On Tuesday, the state urban development minister will be conducting a meeting with NMC officials to decide upon the rent.
 
 The NMC has its commercial complexes and shopping centres across six divisions of the city -   East, Nashik West, Nashik Road, New Nashik, Satpur and Panchavati. The civic body has a total of 1,905 galas (shops) across the city of which 1,830 shops have been leased out for commercial activities. The remaining 75 galas have not found takers for the past few years.
 
 "The shops are rented out for a period of three years after which a fresh auction is conducted for the shops. The NMC has decided to increase the period of lease from three to 15 years and hike the rate as per the ready reckoner rates of the area where the shop is located," said an NMC official. "Some shopkeepers had objected to the proposal of ready reckoner and had sought the MLA's help who took the matter to the state minister asking him to take back the decision of rate hike. On Tuesday, the minister will be discussing about the proposal with NMC officials," he added.
 
 The official said that shopkeepers in around 15 places have objected to the hike.
