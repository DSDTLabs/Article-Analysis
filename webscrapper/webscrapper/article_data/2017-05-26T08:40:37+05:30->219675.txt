RANCHI: With the state upbeat on the prospects of a textile and apparel industry in the coming years post Momentum  , Chief minister (CM)   on Thursday advised   to manufacture more "marketable and fashionable" products. 

 In his address, before the inauguration of the three-day fashion festival, organized by Jharcraft at a city hotel,   urged the weaving community of the state to focus on "preparing apparels to suit the market demands more." 
 
 "Jharkhand produces roughly 82% of the total silk that is produced in India. However, manufacturers of silk products here must produce according to the demands of the market," the CM said, adding that Jharkhand and Jharcraft have the potential to become big time national and global markets in silk and lac based products in the coming years. 
 
 Jharcraft took a step towards exploring the global market through e-commerce platforms and formally launched the sale of silk sarees, men apparels and other products on a global e-commerce company. The officials of Jharcraft expressed the confidence that many more manufacturers from the state will join the e-commerce bandwagon in the coming years. 
 
 Stating that the weaving industry is hinging crucially on the participation of women, the CM stated that his government will be bringing nearly 4.82 lakh women under the new skill development program. "A   of Rs 700 crore has been provisioned in this year's budget for the skill development program," Das said.
