AHMEDABAD: A metropolitan court has issued a contempt of court notice to the ADGP of CID (crime) and summoned the police officer concerned in seven daysâ€™ time, to explain why the court order to initiate proceedings under corruption charges in the Rs 1,100-crore   ( ) scam was not acted on for more than three months.

 Additional chief metropolitan magistrate A R Patel also sent a notice to the city police commissioner last week, questioning why further probe was not carried out despite the court order and why no chargesheet was filed before a special court.
 
 This came after the court found that in 18 different cases pertaining to bank fraud pending before this court, it was found out that charges of corruption were made out. Even the prosecution had demanded further investigation in this regard, and the court ordered further investigation on January 17. The court also ordered that the   of   zone should file a report on the investigation into charges punishable under Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act before the court concerned. It so happened that the police department did not respond to the court order so far as these 18 pending cases are concerned. This led the court to issue notices to the city police commissioner and the ADGP, CID (crime).
 
 The court had set a deadline of May 5 for a response, but no one appeared before the court.
 
 In 2012, the   ordered that MMCB be shut down over illegal loans worth Rs 1,100 crore, of which Ketan Parekh and a few others had defaulted on Rs 800 crore.
