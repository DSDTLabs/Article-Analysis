How often do we get to witness painting exhibitions dedicated only to animals? Titled Equivalent Emotions, Gumi Malhotra’s recent show of   canvases was all about the love for animals. “We may fail to notice it sometimes, but animals, like human beings, go through an entire gamut of emotions. And that is what I intend to portray through my paintings,” says the artist, whose candid pet   have struck a chord with animal lovers in the city.

  From puppies and piglets to goats, cows, monkeys and roosters —all her paintings are emotive and express the artist’s strong bond with animals. Each painting takes nearly a week to complete. “I share a deep connection with animals. There is no pretence in them; they don’t wear masks like us humans. Contrary to popular belief, there is actually more order in the animal world than ours. They are brutal only when it comes to hunger and safeguarding their territory. We might be more evolved, but animals are always more honest and compassionate,” Gumi sums up. Proceeds of the exhibition go for the benefit of animals at   in Bengaluru.
