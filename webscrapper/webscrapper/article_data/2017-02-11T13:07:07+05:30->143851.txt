PUNE: As many as 56 additional closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras are being installed in and around the ‘blind spots’ on the   premises. 

 Sources from the   said the number of cameras would soon touch the mark of 202. “All the   installed in and around the premises of the airport are in perfect working condition. But there are several   in the airport terminal building and the premises that need to be covered. These cameras provide clear images both during the day and after dark,” an airport official told TOI.
 
 “The new cameras are mainly installed for passengers, who tend to lose their luggage and insist on checking CCTV footage. Besides, these cameras will also keep an eye on the airport staff and passengers as stress is on security and safety more than ever these days,” the official added.
