CHENNAI:   are very intelligent birds and can even be trained to speak. These qualities make them among the most sought after pets. The demand pushes traders to collect birds from the wild.

 Wildlife crime control bureau southern region deputy director T Uma told TOI officials came across online portals offering parakeets for sale. Authorities pretending to be prospective buyers asked traders to show the specimen. When traders brought live birds, the birds were seized and the traders arrested. 
 
 The crime control bureau seized nearly a dozen live birds over the past four days. The arrested were identified as N S Srikanth of Tambaram, Gowrishankar of Ponneri, V Suresh of Valasaravakkam, S Mohan of Kolathur and M   of Old Washermanpet. These birds are bred in private houses in Kolathur, Perambur, T Nagar, Koyambedu and Parrys Corner, Uma said.
