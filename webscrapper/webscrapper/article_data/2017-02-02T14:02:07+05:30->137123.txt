Young designer   had the most fun show ever at Lakme Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2017 yesterday! He presented his Race for Separates collection on Wednesday and even had the lively actor   walk as a showstopper. The actor was seen wearing an ivory sleeveless jacket with a kurta that had the embroidered sleeves like the jacket—which made it seem like the sleeves were on the kurta! And isn’t that just perfect for summers? Wearing separates in different ways. Well, Kunal Rawal’s collection was all about that. 

 The front row was filled with Bollywood’s young stars rooting for Kunal Rawal. The attendees were Arjun Kapoor, Sonakshi Sinha, Prateik Babbar and Mohit Marwah. It was a perfect combination of fun and fashion—Varun Dhawan even pulled his bestie   to walk the ramp along with him and Kunal Rawal. The duo even picked up the designer on the ramp and cheerfully posed for the camera.
