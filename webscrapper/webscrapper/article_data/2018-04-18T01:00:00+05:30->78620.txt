When Iranian filmmaker   decided to set his foot in India to make ' ', the idea behind it was more than just to shoot a film in the country. The Oscar-nominated director had a clear vision for his debut Hindi-language movie and to fulfil his vision, the best of artistes and technicians from the Indian film industry came together. Majidi, who came to India with just one assistant, worked with an all-Indian crew in 'Beyond The Clouds'. This includes the producers of the film, Namah Pictures, who brought the legend to India; one of the leading studios in the country, Zee Studios, who are presenting the film; Oscar-winning music composer AR Rahman; ace cinematographer Anil Mehta; Vishal Bhardwaj, who has written the Hindi dialogues and the lead actors of the film,   and  . Talking about his experience of working in India, Majidi shared, “Cinema is a magical medium that has the power to unite. I’ve been blessed to work with the best of India’s talent, who hail from different parts of the country. I knew I needed to work with people from here to be able to honestly portray a story set in India. When I met the talented team at Namah Pictures and Zee Studios, they made my work easy and never made me feel like I was working in another country. The same is true for everyone else involved — Honey Trehan, AR  , Gautam Ghose, Anil Mehta and Vishal Bhardwaj. The culture and stories I found in India are very similar to those back home in Iran. I am at home with my new family; that’s what India and this team have become for me.”

 'Beyond The Clouds', produced by Zee Studios and Namah Pictures, releases worldwide on April 20.
