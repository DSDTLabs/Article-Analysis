COIMBATORE: A group of ex-servicemen has accused the   of failing to hand over the 400 dwelling units allotted to them. The   (AWHO) had collected crores of rupees from 400 ex-servicemen to construct the dwelling units at Chinnavedampatti near   in Coimbatore city and promised them to hand over the apartments before December 2013. However, the construction work has not been completed and they are forced to pay huge interest to banks for the loans, the ex-servicemen told TOI.

 AWHO builds homes to those fighting and serving in insurgency areas and inhospitable terrain. For the first time, the organisation had selected the land at Chinnavedampatti to construct 400 dwelling units for ex-servicemen and army men who are working in various parts of the State. The AWHO received applications from 400 people and received crores of rupees from them to construct five types of dwelling units – row houses, modern apartment, super deluxe, deluxe and small family apartments. The rate of the dwelling units ranges from Rs 19.67 lakh to Rs 46.55 lakh.
 
 AWHO had started the construction work at Chinnavedampatti in 2010 and promised to handover the dwelling units to the beneficiaries in December 2013. “We borrowed lakhs of rupees from various banks to pay the amount. We were not given the houses in December 2013 and are forced to pay the interest for the loans for the last four years. When we approached the senior officials of AWHO. they promised that they would hand over the dwelling units before December 2017,” said an ex-serviceman. 
 
 Col V Sudhakar, project director, AWHO, Coimbatore blamed the delay on the building contractor, who had cancelled the contract. “We have handed over the construction work to a new contractor and the work has progressed to more than 70%. All efforts are being made to hand over the dwelling units in December 2017,” Sudhakar told TOI.
