NEW DELHI: People with greed for   consider young   as a business venture from where profits can be yielded by demanding dowry for the sake of her happiness and to save her marriage, said a   while sentencing a man to three years imprisonment for cruelty towards his wife.

 Metropolitan magistrate Shefali Barnala Tandon while sentencing the man on charges of domestic violence said he along with his brother and sister-in-law had tortured his wife. It also awarded one-year imprisonment each to the in-laws.
 
 “Every newly-married girl enters her matrimonial home with a lot of dreams, hopes and aspirations, but greed for dowry makes her life a living hell,” the court said.
 
 Calling it a “social menace”, the court said,   puts pressure and harassment on the victim. “Section 498A IPC (domestic violence) is not an offence where there is just economic loss or physical suffering, but it entails human emotions,” the court said.
 
 Soon after her marriage in 1991, the woman alleged that she was subjected to harassment, taunts and cruelty despite her family meeting sufficient dowry demands. She gave specific dates when she was tortured and claimed that even on the birth of their child a year later, the husband did not come to see the newborn nor did he meet the child ever since.
 
 “The victim was ill-treated even during her pregnancy. She was physically and mentally tortured,” the court observed.
 
 The defence lawyer argued that the FIR was lodged in 1995 and the convicts had faced the trial’s ordeal ever since. It sought that they be released on probation given they had a clean previous criminal record.
 
 The court also asked the husband to pay Rs 3 lakh while the in-laws were also directed to give Rs 1 lakh each as compensation.
