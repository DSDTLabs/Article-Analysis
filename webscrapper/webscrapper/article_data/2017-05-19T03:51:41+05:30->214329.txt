 NDMC spokesperson M S Shehrawat said a blueprint was being readied, and a door-to-door awareness drive and a public appeal via newspapers would precede the implementation. 
 
 “In five colonies, our initiative to make zero waste colonies has generated encouraging response from the residents. A perceptible change in people’s attitude is visible,” NDMC chairman Naresh Kumar said.
 
 Ravinder Nagar has apparently shown the way to segregate waste. “People used to throw waste outside dustbins earlier. The same people now teach others to segregate waste,” said Sunil Kumar, a sanitation worker. 
 
 Elsewhere in Chanakyapuri (D1, D2), sanitation workers have been trained by NGOs to spread awareness. This has worked, said Shakuntala Srivastava, an NDMC health official. 
 
 A sustained awareness campaign has helped in both cases, say officials. NDMC has roped in ITC to implement its Wellbeing out of Waste (WoW) initiative in its areas. ITC along with NGO ESREE Foundation would also train people. residents and sanitation staff alike.
