NAGPUR:   in Nagpur and traffic policemen can now expect better functioning of traffic signals. The   panel headed by Sudhir Raut on Friday gave its nod to appoint three contractors instead of one to maintain   at around 150 busy junctions across the city.

 Earlier, only one city-based contractor M/s   was entrusted to maintain traffic signals. But the firm has miserably failed to maintain traffic signals. Even the traffic police too have made regular complaints to the civic body.
 
 Before Decofurn, M/s Keltron Limited was maintaining traffic signals until 2007. However, when the BJP come to power, it discontinued the contract and appointed a local firm. Since then, maintenance of signals was severely hit and the   too faced severe criticism.
 
 Now, the NMC will divide the maintenance works of 150 junctions among the three, Raut said.
 
 The panel also gave its nod to hot mix plant’s proposal of Rs4.28 lakh to transport tar from HPCL refinery in Mumbai through a private transporter and sell scrap from the octroi department.
 
 However, as the model code of conduct for teacher’s constituency polls come into force, the panel sent back other 9 proposals, including consideration of feasibility report on running a multi-speciality hospital at its defunct Devadiya Hospital and issuing of work order of Rs10.67 crore under the second phase of cement road.
