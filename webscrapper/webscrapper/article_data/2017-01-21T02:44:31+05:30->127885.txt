NEW DELHI: The high court on Friday left it to the lieutenant governor to reconsider his decision to   out the  , in light of the speaker’s refusal to relieve him, citing work requirement.

 The speaker has come to court over the shifting out of the secretary to Prasar Bharti.
 
 “Let the   have a re-look at this order, but not as a direction from this court. Place it before him. If he decides not to review it, then we will take it up,” Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva told Delhi government standing counsel Rahul Mehra, while hearing the speaker’s petition.
 
 Mehra, on behalf of the government, told the court it will place the matter before LG Anil Baijal and maintained that the decision to appoint   and to extend his deputation to the assembly was taken after a discussion between the chief minister and the speaker.
 
 As regards disciplinary proceedings against the official for a newspaper article he wrote, the court said it will not interfere and advised the official to “seek your own remedies.”
 
 Justice Sachdeva decided to await the LG’s decision after being informed by the government that a discussion between speaker Ram Niwas Goel and the director general of All India Radio (AIR) over posting of Suryadevara had failed to break the impasse.
 
 When the authorities told the court that the DG AIR has made it clear that “granting of extension or facilitating absorption can be considered after the enquiry has been concluded” the court questioned the Centre’s attitude and pointed out that “you cannot keep extension conditional on that”. 
 
 It also questioned the Centre on its stand saying “what is the problem in granting an extension?” while empathising with the official since he was caught between orders of the speaker and Prasar Bharti, his parent organisation.
 
 On its part, Prasar Bharti claimed it had no option since All India Radio is “facing a huge manpower crunch.”
