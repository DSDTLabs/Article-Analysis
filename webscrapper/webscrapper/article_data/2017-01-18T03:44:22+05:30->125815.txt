Gurgaon: Health services remain severely affected at  , which is grappling with a severe shortage of nursing staff.   are overworked, attending to around 40-50 patients on an average daily. Also, working double shifts has become a daily affair, they allege.

 The hospital has a sanctioned strength of 95 nurses to tend to the 200 beds and attend an average of 1,500 OPD patients daily. However, the hospital currently has only 42 nurses, less than half of the sanctioned strength. In such a scenario, the nurses are compelled to pitch in for more than 16 hours on a usual day. The patients end up waiting for 30-40 minutes before a nurse can attend to them.
 
 “A nurse is responsible for administering a patient medicine and injections, maintaining the healthcare chart for the doctors, and keeping a check on a patient’s diet. Ideally, a nurse should be like a personal attendant. But here, we can barely spend a minute with a patient. We don’t even have time to see if they are recovering or not,” a nurse told TOI, pleading anonymity. She added that in the maternity ward, which witnesses 20-25 deliveries everyday, only three nurses are deployed in a single shift.
 
 According to the staff, no recruitments have been made in the last few years in the hospital even as the higher authorities are aware of the  .
 
 A health official said, “The nurses hired on contractual basis turned out to be less efficient to handle emergency cases, while recruitment of permanent employees by state authorities is a long process.” The hospital has deployed 10 nurses from urban PHCs in the district.
