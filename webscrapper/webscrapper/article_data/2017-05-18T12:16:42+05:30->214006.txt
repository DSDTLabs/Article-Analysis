"Roseanne", the popular US sitcom from the 1980s and 90s, is set for an eight-episode revival in 2018.
 
  ABC network bosses have announced the return of the popular sitcom, which initially ran for nine seasons from 1988 until 1997, and have also revealed that most of the original cast have committed to the project, reported Los Angeles Times.
  
  
 
  
  Roseanne Barr (Roseanne), John Goodman (Dan),   (Darlene), Laurie Metcalf (Jackie),   (D.J.) and   (Becky) are all set to reprise their original roles, although Johnny Galecki, who played David, cannot because of his commitments to the CBS sitcom "The Big Bang Theory".
  
  In a statement, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said, "' ' joys and struggles are as relevant and hilarious today as they were then, and there's really no one better to comment on our modern America than Roseanne."
  
  A premiere date for the revival of "Roseanne" has still to be announced, but ABC - which had been competing with Netflix to restart the show - has confirmed it will return to TV screens some time in mid-2018.
