Panaji: Minister for town and country planning and agriculture, Vijai Sardesai, cautioned government servants against not taking the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act- 2007 seriously. Government agencies “either by ignorance or arrogance” aren’t implementing the law, he said, adding that action would be taken against those who don’t treat offences against senior citizens as cognisable offences. He was speaking on the occasion of World Elder’s Day organized by the All Goa Senior Citizens Federation in Margao on Sunday. Ten years after the act was implemented, even senior police officials are unaware of it, federation president Diogo M Da Costa said, adding that the police continue to register offences against senior citizens as non-cognizable ones.  The federation’s legal cell listens to both sides and sends a report to the deputy collector recommending a monthly allowance for maintenance from the next of kin, following which orders are passed.  Senior citziens are slowly becoming the biggest vote bank in the country. A separate ministry for senior citizens will be the demand in the years to come, Margao MLA Digambar Kamat said.
