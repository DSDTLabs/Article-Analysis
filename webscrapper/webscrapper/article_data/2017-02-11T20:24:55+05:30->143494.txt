With opinion within the state Congress divided over support to V K Sasikala, party vice-president   told leaders to wait for the governor's decision before making a move.

 In a meeting convened by Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Friday, S Thirunavukkarasar, a former   leader and present TNCC chief, and former RS MP Sudarsana Natchiappan appeared to have batted for the Sasikala faction.Thirunavukkarasar told TOI, “The governor should fulfill his duty which means inviting the person whom the legislature party has elected as its leader. “P Chidambaram and others expressed the view that no support should be extended to Sasikala as the public sentiment was against her. “There was no support to O Panneerselvam as well during the meet. After listening to each one of them, Rahul asked the leaders finally to wait for governor's decision,“ said a party source.
 
 
  
 
 
 
 Congress leader Karti P Chidambaram tweeted that there was no question of the Congress supporting Sasikala.“Every MLA is totally tuned to the public sentiment,“ he said. AIADMK's solid strength in the assembly and Parliament gives it a disproportionate voice in the Presidential electoral college. According to the political buzz, if the BJP has a bad result in five states in March, realignment by a couple of regional parties can open up the election. Given the prospect, Congressmen argue that the party gains little by antagonizing the AIADMK if Sasikala is going to emerge victorious. But siding with her in the uncertain situation, with a looming court verdict in the corruption case, can also prove a costly mistake.
 
 According to party leaders, the eight MLAs of Congress have little role in government formation but landing on the right side of the AIADMK feud could be key to the coming Presidential elections.
