KOLKATA: A   post by a person claiming to be a motorman with the railways went viral on Friday evening attracting netizens’ wrath.

 It said the incident at   railway station, where three persons were injured after a local train allegedly did not stop after noticing left supporters putting up a rail block on the tracks, was a “lesson” for bandh supporters who harass daily commuters. 
 
  R N   said, “He claims that it is not his account. We have initiated an inquiry. Under service rules, he is not authorised to comment about his job on any media platform.”
