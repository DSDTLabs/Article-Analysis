KOLKATA: The much-debated healthcare clamp —   (Registration, Regulation and Transparency) Bill, 2017 — has got the final stamp from   before it becomes an Act.

 West Bengal governor   put his seal on the bill on Thursday, the development coming just two days before a team of   doctors from Delhi are scheduled to meet him to seek its scrapping.
 
 Anticipating the growing debate among a section of doctors who feel they may be discriminated against under the new law, Bengal parliamentary affairs minister   called on the governor on Thursday to expedite the process when the bill was lying at Raj Bhavan since Tuesday. Those who opposed it read the delay as a sign of reluctance on the part of Raj Bhavan to clear the “discriminatory” bill.
 
 Soon after the governor’s signature, the state government showed rare alacrity and set up the 11-member   Health Regulatory Commission (as provided in the bill) that will arbitrate complaints of medical negligence filed under the act.
 
 The passing of the bill prompted a sharp reaction from the Indian Medical Association (IMA). “We must now study the legal provisions and are seriously considering moving court. Our legal experts will be consulted on Friday and we hope we will be able to decide by the end of the week,” said K K Aggarwal, national president of IMA.
 
 The IMA team — comprising 20 Bengal IMA members — coming to the city will be led by Aggarwal. It also plans to meet chief minister Mamata Banerjee.
