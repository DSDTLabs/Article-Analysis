AHMEDABAD: The Mehta family of Isanpur was on an outing when it saw small kids rummaging through sanitary pads while collecting plastic items to earn a living, at the city's Pirana dumping yard. 

 Aggrieved, the family started working on a mission to create a machine which can dispose of sanitary pads in an eco-friendly manner. 
 
 The family took five years to create an automatic machine which burns sanitary pads. The   disposal machine made by the family - including Daxesh Mehta; his brother Krupesh Mehta; and Daxesh Mehta's sons, Hitarth and Archan - has been named 'San-Burn'. It is made of stainless steel and runs on electricity. 
 
 "Generally, women either throw away sanitary pads in plastic bags or flush them," Daxesh said. "In the first case, plastic is used and in the second, around 5-10 litres of water is wasted. If the pad is thrown into dustbins, it reaches the dumping yard where sanitary workers dispose of it with bare hands." So the Mehtas wanted to develop a machine that destroy the pads completely.
 
 The design of machine was conceptualized by Krupesh and modifications introduced by Hitarh and Archan; Daxesh played the mentor of the project. 
 
 The project has been patented and got the nod from the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. It was on display at  . The machine weighs around 15kg and is just 2 ft long. It can be fixed on the walls of washrooms.
 
 "The machine can be set up at washrooms of corporate houses, schools, hospitals and hotels," Daxesh said. "When five pads are put into the machine, it starts working and the pads are reduced in ashes. Even if the machine runs all day, only half a unit is consumed.
 
 "We have installed a smoke filter inside the machine so it will not emit smoke when the pads are burnt," Archan said.
