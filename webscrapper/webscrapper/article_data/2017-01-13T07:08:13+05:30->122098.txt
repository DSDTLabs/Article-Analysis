NEW DELHI: The ministry of home affairs gave security clearance to about 1,300 fresh investment proposals in 2016 after conducting national risk assessment as part of government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative. Officials said the go ahead came after   issued policy guidelines in July 1, 2015 for assessment of proposals for national security clearance.

 “The aim is to ensure an objective balance between the requirements of national security and the imperatives of rapid economic growth,” an official said.
 
 As many as 1,744 industrial projects were given security clearance in 2015, while 815 investment proposals were cleared in 2014 and 712 proposals in 2013.
 
 The objective of the national security clearance is to evaluate potential threats, visible or embedded, in proposals received by the home ministry and to provide a risk assessment from the point of view of threats falling within national security concerns. MHA has defined security rating parameters to evaluate the proposals uniformly.
 
 The national security clearance policy was drawn up by the government to fasttrack the security clearance process and complete it within 4-6 weeks as part of the PM’s ease of business mantra under the   initiative.
 
 As per the policy, the promoters, owners and directors of the company are mandated to give self-declarations regarding any criminal history on their part. This reduced the period required to give security clearance from 2-3 months earlier to just 4-6 weeks now.
 
 Security inputs from  ,  ,   and other agencies are sought only in serious crimes and not in case of minor offences.
