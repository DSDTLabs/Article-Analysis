NOIDA/GREATER NOIDA: After the spate of robberies in   on Monday, two daytime robberies, one of them at gunpoint, were reported from Noida and Greater Noida on Tuesday. FIRs have been lodged in both the cases, and the police are examining CCTV footage of the areas. 

 In Greater Noida, a 31-year-old salesman was allegedly robbed of Rs 32,000 near Amritpuram roundabout when he was returning from Sector Beta 1. Manoj Singh was returning from Rampur village in Sector Beta I to Tugalpur when he was allegedly intercepted by three men on a Pulsar motorcycle without a registration plate around 2pm. “At least two of the three masked men were armed and they robbed Manoj of Rs 32,000, out of which Rs 25,000 belonged to the company,” Mukesh Garg, vice-proprietor of JP Enterprises, the company for which Manoj works, said. 
 
 In Noida, a man was allegedly robbed of Rs 44,000, which he had just withdrawn from an ICICI Bank branch in Sector 1. “Balram Kumar, an employee of a courier company, was returning from ICICI Bank and was walking towards the mint when a masked man grabbed him from behind and took out the cash kept in his side pocket,” said Satyavaan, operations manager at Prakash Parcel Service Ltd, the courier company. Police, however, said they doubt that version.
