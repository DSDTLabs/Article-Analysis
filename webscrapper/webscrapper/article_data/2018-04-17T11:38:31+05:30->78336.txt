VIJAYAWADA: YSR Congress Party chief   on Monday charged AP   with diluting the spirit of fight for special category status.   also questioned Naidu for not supporting the bandh.

 “I have a question for the chief minister. Is it not true that you have always tried to dilute the struggle for special category status to the state? Instead of getting your MPs to resign or take up an indefinite fast, you commented well ahead that bandhs are a ‘waste’. You got notices issued to leaders taking part in the bandh saying that stern action would be taken against their involvement,” he said.
 
 Jagan accused Naidu of crashing the aspirations of the people and betraying the people of AP. Meanwhile, YSRCP MPs managed an appointment with President   on Tuesday.
