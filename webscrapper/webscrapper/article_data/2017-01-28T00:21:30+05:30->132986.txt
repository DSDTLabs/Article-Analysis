Chennai: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence ( ) early on Friday arrested a passenger who was carrying the equivalent of Rs 77 lakh in foreign   notes at the Chennai airport. Two of the bundles were tightly packed and wrapped with tape and concealed in his rectum. Other bundles were in his baggage.

 The passenger, identified as Yousuf Shahul Hameed, was scheduled to travel to Singapore on by Scoot Airlines flight TZ501, DRI officials said. He was carrying an assortment of foreign currency notes, including Australian dollars, US dollars, Canada cent dollars, euros, pounds, francs, Singapore dollars, Malaysian ringgits, Saudi and Qatari riyals.
 
 The DRI had received a specific tip about currency notes being smuggled from Chennai to Singapore and Malaysia and had been keeping a close watch on suspicious movements. Concealing pouches in body cavities is a common tactic used by couriers, officials said. But the surprise was the wide variety of currency notes that the courier was carrying, they added.
 
 A DRI official said Hameed could not produce any documents for legal purchase and possession of the foreign currency and as the amount was above the permitted limit, it was seized and he was arrested under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962 and the Baggage Rules, 2016 read with Foreign Exchange Management (Import and Export of Currency) Regulations, 2015.
 
 Further investigation is under way to find out if he is part of an organised racket.
