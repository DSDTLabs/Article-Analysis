Mumbai: The stock prices of   and  , the two listed entities promoted by the Singh family of   fame, crashed in Monday’s session after   downgraded some of the debt papers issued by   — the main promoter entity of the two companies. On Friday, India Ratings downgraded some of RHC Holdings’ papers to default category while some were downgraded to ‘Ind C’, just a notch above the default rating due to RHC’s inability to meet its payment obligations on debt aggregating Rs 200 crore. 

 In Monday’s strong market, Fortis Healthcare closed 8.7% lower at Rs 149 while Religare Enterprises closed 4.4% lower at Rs 112. In addition to the downgrading of the parent, three group companies — Religare Enterprises,   and   — have been put under ratings watch with negative implications. “The downgrade of ratings on other debt instruments reflects an impaired-debt servicing capability due to a stretched liquidity position,” a release from the ratings agency said.
 
 On June 20, TOI had reported that India Ratings red-flagged investors about a cash crunch in RHC Holdings — since the expected funds from the company’s deal to sell off its health insurance stake was taking time. In the last one month, Fortis Healthcare’s stock price has plunged nearly 21% while Religare Enterprises has lost nearly 39%.
