Mysuru: Two married women research scholars of the   (UoM) were given six months extension to complete their PhD theses on maternity grounds, after they submitted medical certificates.

 According to a source in the UoM, four research scholars of the university had applied seeking an extension of duration to complete their PhDs. All four applicants were present at the UoM Syndicate meeting recently. Among them, two were male research scholars and the Syndicate, after due deliberation, rejected their applications and declined to give them an extension.
 
 The Syndicate approved the request of the   and gave them an additional six months to complete their theses.
 
 The source said the women scholars had completed seven years of research, and sought an additional six months to complete their work. “They submitted their medical certificates, so it was unanimously decided to give them six months’ extension,” said an officer.
 
 University of Mysore Syndicate member M S S Kumar said, “The decision was taken on humanitarian grounds. Pregnant women face health problems so we decided to give them an extension," he said. “Four research scholars had sought an extension of duration but we rejected the applications of two men.”
 
 Recently, the State Women's Commission, too, has written to the University in this regard, he added.
 
 Academician M S Thimmappa said extending maternity benefits to research scholars is a welcome move. “Research work involves field activities, practicals etc. So it is really difficult to stick to a fixed deadline. I welcome this decision,” he said.
