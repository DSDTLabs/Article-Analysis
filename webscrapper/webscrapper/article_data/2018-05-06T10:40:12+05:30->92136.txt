SHIMLA: A   man had been impersonating as an aide-de-camp (ADC) to HP governor   and making phone calls to bureaucrats in Haryana to seek favours in government job appointments by claiming that the governor asked for it.

 
 This came to light on Saturday, when the actual ADC to the governor,  , received three audio clips of the impersonator talking to a bureaucrat in Haryana.
 
 The accused is yet to be identified. Alarmed over the clips, the governor’s office has lodged a complaint with Himachal DGP S R Mardi, seeking “appropriate action” against the impersonator.
 
 Thakur is a 2013-batch IPS officer of the   cadre. Before he was posted with the governor on July 11 last year, he was posted as the ASP of Shimla. In the clips, the impersonator is heard identifying himself as the ADC to the governor and dropping his name while recommending the name of someone for a government job.
 
 Professor  , the advisor to governor, said they only knew that the accused was a resident of Haryana. “We need to identify him and find out since when this had been on,” he added. He said the accused phoned IAS officers of Haryana. “It needs to be investigated whether he had made calls to Haryana ministers,” he added.
