Vasco: The Chicalim panchayat has raised the issue of parking chaos near a newly-opened megamart at Dabolim, saying that it lacks proper parking facility. Sarpanch of Chicalim panchayat, Seby Pereira, met traffic police officials on Saturday, and raised concerns of parking of vehicles along a stretch of NH 17B. When contacted, Vasco traffic cell PI, Roy Pereira, said “I have no idea how the mart has come up without basic arrangements. But, certainly it is an unnecessary trouble to our cell. I have to send my staff from Vasco to handle the traffic.” Traffic police has issued challans and clamped vehices parked on the highway. The mart opened last weekend and since then, vehicles parked on either side of the highway has made news on social media, with complaints made to stakeholders. The narrowness of the highway could cause major road accidents, citizens said. The traffic cell, too, will be writing to the authorities concerned, asking for explanations and demanding that proper arrangements be made immediately.  The owner of the mart has submitted a written assurance to the panchayat that in eight days, it will resolve all parking issues and make parking available for atleast 40 vehicles.
