Chennai: The Tamil Nadu police have arrested two men for trolling and criticising Justice N Kirubakaran of the Madras high court on social media for his remarks on the striking government school teachers.

  More than 43,000 government school teachers boycotted classes recently demanding implementation of the seventh pay commission recommendations and scrapping of contributory pension scheme. 
 
 Last week, Justice Kirubakaran asked whether the striking government school teachers were not ashamed of the fact that only five students from government schools made it to the MBBS course in any of the 22 government medical colleges in the state this year. 
 
 The judge was trolled online after his remarks. The justice asked the police to collect details of offensive posts after some advocates mentioned it in his court on Friday last.
 
 Police said Subash Chandra Bose, a retired government official and an employeesâ€™ union office-bearer in Chennai, had posted offensive messages against the justice. 
 
 The police also arrested Murugan, 47, of Thirumal Nagar in Palayamkottai near Tirunelveli. Murugan had criticised the judge while addressing the protesters.
 
 The Palayamkottai police registered a case under the IPC Sections 500 (punishment for defamation), 505 (1) (a) (whoever makes, publishes or circulates any statement, rumour or report with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, any officer), and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant).
 
 Both of them were remanded in judicial custody.
