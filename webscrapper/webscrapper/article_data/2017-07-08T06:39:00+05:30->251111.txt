Nagpur: The looming question whether the Goods and Service Tax ( ), enforced on July 1, will benefit the   at large became the topic of discussion in a lecture session organized by Akhil Bharatiya Grahak Panchayat (ABGP). On Friday, chartered accountant Abhijit Kelkar gave a lecture at the panchayat’s office in Ramdaspeth and stressed that there will no direct benefit for consumers in a broader sense.

 “The impact on price of a majority of goods is not more than 5% either way. This is because there are now five taxable brackets according to which various goods and services will be taxed. Tax on certain goods have been relaxed while some will carry more. So, there is no real difference overall as far as the consumer is concerned,” said Kelkar.
 
 “People still believe that the consumers will benefit now that a complex tax structure has been replaced by a much simpler one,” said Kelkar. “Let me tell you that as a trader my cost of doing business will be reduced because I now get tax credit for the inclusive price I paid while buying,” he added.
 
 Kelkar held that the perks of the input tax credit which businesses will receive must be passed on to the customer. Large corporations have already done it and others should follow suit, he said. The CA gave an example, “As soon as GST was enforced car manufacturers slashed prices of their products by Rs15,000 to 20,000. They could do this because they had marketing experts who penned down the benefits for the companies.”
 
 Kelkar addressed the sentiment of many people who find the new tax regime ‘irritating’ and said, “It is natural that people are uncomfortable with GST. But we must realize the system is very new and it will take at least six months for things to normalize. Within three years people will not find any other system to be better than GST. ”
