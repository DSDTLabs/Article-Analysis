PUNE: Voters in the city can get a first-hand experience on the process of voting for the forthcoming civic poll through videos. 

 The civic body has uploaded videos on its website and its official Facebook page to explain the voting process. The initiative aims to ensure error-free voting on February 21, PMC officials said. 
 
 The city, for the first time, has a four-ward panel system for the civic polls. Every voter is expected to cast votes to elect four candidates without which a vote will become invalid. 
 
 Officials said they have explained in detail how a person can read the electronic voting machine (EVM) at the polling booth, how to press the button and complete the process quickly.
 
 Officials said videos are self-explanatory and have a voiceover which explains every step after the voter reaches the polling booth. The videos have explained how to cast a vote wherein a single EVM with a list of candidates from two wards is used. Watching the video a couple of times will give a fair idea to citizens on the voting process, officials said. 
 
 Many voters claimed that they were not aware of the voting procedure because of the changes introduced in the panels.   of Erandawane, said the administration must clear their doubts otherwise people will not be able to vote correctly. Authorities should deploy additional staff at polling booths to explain the process to ensure fair polling, Mehta said.
 
 The civic body has already planned mock drills at housing societies to explain the process and colour codes assigned for every category in each panel.
 
 Municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar had earlier told TOI that the ROs would reach societies, slums and public spaces to shed some light on the system.
