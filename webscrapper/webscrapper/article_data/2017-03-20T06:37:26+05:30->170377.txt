VADODARA: City-based   rolled back its decision of fee hike of 10% to 12% on Sunday.

 The decision came after the parents had protested against the decision and had submitted a memorandum to the school authorities on March 16 demanding a roll back. On Saturday, hundreds of parents had held a meeting and had decided to make representations to the   and collector. The parents had also decided to write to the   and chief minister in coming days. But, the school authorities rolled back its decision before the protests aggravated. A circular released by the school states that after the school management’s meeting the hike in school fees have been cancelled.
 
 Principal of the school, Paresh Shah said, “Exams of students are going to begin and the protest was disturbing studies. Also, some political persons were getting involved in the protest for no reason so we held a meeting and rolled back the fees.”
 
 Shah added that if government rules allow fee hike then management will hold a meeting with parents and increase the fees. “School will distribute circular among the parents so that they won’t be misguided,” he said.
