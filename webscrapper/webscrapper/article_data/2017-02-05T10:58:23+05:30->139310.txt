NEW DELHI: India repatriated a 5-yearold Pakistani boy reuniting him with his mother on Saturday at the   border. According to Pakistani authorities, the boy, Iftikhar Ahmed, was forcibly taken to Jammu & Kashmir by his father who belongs to the state.

  Abdul Basit “appreciated the cooperative role of the Indian government“ in the return of Iftikhar Ahmed, said the Pakistan mission here. “I am extremely happy to have my son back. I am thankful to the Pakistani government for its help for return of my child,“ Iftikhar's mother   said. “I had lost all hope of getting my child back. It's nothing short of a miracle for me.“
 
 The child's mother claimed that her ex-husband brought her son to India in March 2016 saying he was taking his child to a wedding first to Dubai and then to Kashmir. Kiyani then brought a lawsuit against her ex-husband in a court in India with the help of Pakistan high commission in New Delhi. The court ruled that the child should return to Pakistan in May 2016, but cross-border tensions between the two countries de layed his return by eight months.
 
 After the case was taken up by the Pakistan high commission and it was proven that Iftikhar was a Pakistani by nationality , the verdict was given that he be returned to his mother living across the line of control.
 
 The boy's mother belongs to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. For the past several months, the boy lived with his father Gulzar Ahmed in   in Jammu & Kashmir.
