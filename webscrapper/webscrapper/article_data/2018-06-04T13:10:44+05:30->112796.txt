SECUNDERABAD: A day after the ministry of railways gave green signal for the introduction of a new Antyodaya weekly express between Santragachi and  , several residents of Secunderabad and Hyderabad are demanding that the ministry consider rolling out a new train connecting the city with Howrah via Balasore, Cuttack, Bhadrak and Bhubaneshwar in  . 

 
 At present, there are only two regular train services -   and   - connecting the city with various destinations in Odisha and West Bengal upto Kolkata. As the rush of passengers hardly ever slows down throughout the year, commuters find it nearly impossible to get reservations on these trains. 
 
 Raj, who hails from Nadia, West Bengal, and works in a restaurant at Secunderabad, told TOI: "I have ailing parents in my hometown. In case of an emergency, it is so tough to get reservation that I am forced to travel in general coaches. It is not possible for me to book an air ticket. So many people like me have no option but to travel by trains. The railway authorities should spare a thought and introduce one more train that will run in addition to Falaknuma Express and   express." 
 
 Of late, many students and young professionals from the eastern parts of the country are landing in Hyderabad in hopes of better careers. This has added to the burden on the two existing trains.
 
 The railways launched the East Coast Express in 1975 and rolled out Falaknuma Express in 1994. Over two decades have passed, but the railways has not added any new trains on this route.
