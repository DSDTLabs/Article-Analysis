DHARAMSALA:   became India's 33rd Test captain after injured   was ruled out of the fourth and deciding Test against Australia, here today.

 Kohli suffered a shoulder injury while fielding in the Ranchi Test match. Left-arm chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav will be making his debut as India go back to five bowler theory with Bhuvneshwar Kumar replacing Ishant Sharma.
 
 Yesterday Kohli had said that he will only play he is hundred percent fit but had admitted that there is every chance of the injury being aggravated during fielding.
 
 The Indian skipper missed a Test after playing 54 matches in the longest format at a stretch. It started with a Test match against West Indies in Mumbai back in November, 2011.
 
 Coming from India's cricketing nursery Mumbai, Rahane joined the league of legends like Polly Umrigar, Nari Contractor, GS Ramchand, Ajit Wadekar, Sunil Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsarkar, Ravi Shastri and Sachin Tendulkar to captain the country in Test cricket.
