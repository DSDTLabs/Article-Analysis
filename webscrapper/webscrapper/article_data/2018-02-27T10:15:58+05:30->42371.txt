GORAKHPUR: Chief minister   said on Monday that voting on caste lines can defeat development and undo all the efforts being made to bring about the required change. 

 Addressing party workers at   and Gorakhpur on Monday, Yogi urged party workers to work hard, visit every household and tell people that if caste-based politics wins, development will be defeated. "Casteism offers no solution to the existing problems and if caste-based politics wins here then development will be defeated," said Yogi.
 
 Yogi also put a full stop on all rumours that  , the   candidate for Gorakhpur  , is not his choice. 
 
 "When I got the responsibility of the state, I thought that the person who comes in my place should take the development work forward and we selected Upendra Shukla (party candidate) for the responsibility as he is the right person for it. He was the general secretary of district when I came to Gorakhpur and I saw that he always fought for the rights of poor farmers and youth."
 
 "Every party worker should become Upendra Shukla and campaign for him and the party as he cannot go to each house himself. You worked hard to ensure my victory five times. I owe a lot to Gorakhpur," the CM said.
 
 "Development is ensured when people of same ideology work at district, state and central levels," he said.
