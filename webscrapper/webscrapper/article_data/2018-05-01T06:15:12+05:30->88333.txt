THANE: A 23-year-old youth who was convicted for molesting and stalking a minor girl has been released on probation on the condition of good behaviour by a sessions court. 

 The prosecution told the court that the girl was 17 years at the time of incident and used to work as a school bus attendant.
 
 "On 24 July, 2015, the accused, who had been stalking her since three days, accosted her near the gate of a school at Manpada in Thane. He asked her for her mobile number and when she said she did not have one, he caught her hand and tried to kiss her. She pushed him away. Drivers of other school buses immediately intervened and the accused was taken to Kapurbavdi police station. He was booked for stalking and section 18 of   was also slapped against him," the prosecutor told the court. 
 
 The accused claimed innocence and his lawyer said the statement of the girl was inconsistent and did not corroborate with her statement before the magistrate. The defence lawyer said the accused should be given benefit of doubt. Six witnesses were testified in the court. The judge, A S Bhaisare, after hearing both sides, pointed out in his order that the evidence of witnesses are reliable and trustworthy and there is no reason to disbelieve their version. 
 
 Both offences under section 354(D)(1) of the Indian Penal Code and under section 18 of Pocso are proved, the judge noted in the order, adding that the latter Act empowers to add more punishment. 
 
 "As the offence against accused is proved, it is my imperative duty to hear him on point of sentence and as both the accused and his lawyer prayed for probation. Hence, instead of sentencing to suffer imprisonment, he be released on probation of good behaviour on executing a bond of Rs15,000 with surety in like amount for his good conduct for the period of one year from 26 April 2018, and he shall be under the observation of District Probation Officer, Thane," the April 26 order read.
