After showcasing Katta Kalippu look in Oru Mexican Aparatha, Mollywood's young heartthrob Tovino Thomas is here as a romantic hero in Godha. The film's first video song is out and we cannot stop adoring the charming star who flaunts his innocent dimply smile.  The song titled Aaro Nenjil is composed by Shaan Rahman. Featuring Tovino and Wamiqa Gabbi, the beautiful melody is rendered by Gowry Lekshmi. Manu Manjith's rhyming lyrics has made it more fabulous and soul-soothing! Directed by Kunjiramayanam fame Basil Joseph, Godha is a sports comedy based on the game gusthi. He had earlier told us, "the movie will be an entertainer on a boy who wants to master gusthi in the present scenario." The film is shot at the backdrop of Patiala, Punjab and Kerala.
