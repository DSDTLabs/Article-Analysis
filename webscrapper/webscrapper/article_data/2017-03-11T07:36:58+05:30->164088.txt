VADODARA: Over a month after a two-year-old boy was kidnapped from Anand railway station, the government railway police (GRP) on Friday rescued the child from Palej and arrested four persons who had abducted him.

 The four accused, including two women, had picked up the boy   when he was sleeping beside his father  , who is a vendor at the railway station. “We scanned the   footages of the guest house on the railway station and spotted the four persons with the kid,” said a GRP official. 
 
 “The footages showed that they boarded Dadar-Bikaner train from Anand and got down at Nadiad. They then moved out of the railway station and walked towards   police station road,” the official added. The railway special operations group (SOG ) on Friday got a tip-off that the four were seen with the kidnapped kid outside Palej railway station. The police immediately rushed to the spot with the child’s father. 
 
 “When we cornered the woman, who was with the kid, she said that the child was hers. But the boy recognized his father and the woman admitted to have kidnapped him. We arrested two women and two men from the spot,” the police said. 
 
 The accused identified as Sama Sheikh, Sakina Hussain, Salim Sheikh and Bachu Thakor, who is a handicapped person, are beggars and often loiter at the railway stations. 
 
 They told the police that they liked the child and hence abductd him. 
 
 “We are trying to ascertain their motives behind kidnapping the child. It may be possible that they would be using the kidnapped kid to gain sympathy while begging or there may be some other racket. We will seek their remand on Saturday,” the police added.
