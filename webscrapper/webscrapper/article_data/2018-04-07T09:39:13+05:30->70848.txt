HYDERABAD: Less than two weeks after an autorickshaw fell into an open roadside well in Telanganaâ€™s Nizamabad district killing 11 persons, nine people, all tribal women, died when a tractor overturned and plunged into an irrigation canal near Vaddipatla village in Nalgonda district on Friday. The tractor trolley was carrying 30 farm workers at the time of the accident.

 Police and locals fished out nine bodies, while some of the workers were rescued by the villagers who rushed to the spot upon hearing cries from the canal water.
