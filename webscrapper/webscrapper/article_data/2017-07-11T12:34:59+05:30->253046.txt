PUNE: For the past three-and-a-half years, Uttam Kale, a   near Hadapsar, had knocked on every door for information about his 18-year-old son, who had been missing since January 31, 2014.

 On Monday, Kale got some ‘news’ about his son, thanks to an exhibition of photographs of missing and dead person organised by the  . Though he was deeply saddened to come across a photograph of a dead body resembling his son, he somehow felt it would help him find a closure after months of futile search. 
 
 The body was found by the Paud police in the Mutha river in September 2014. “For the first time, I have got some news about my son since he had gone missing. I will go to the Paud police and confirm whether the photograph was of my son,” Kale told TOI.
 
 On Monday, many people visited the headquarters of the Pune Rural Police at Pashan hoping to get information about their missing kin. Fourteen police stations have come together to identify missing persons and dead bodies in a three-day camp organised by the Pune Rural police on Monday. Along with the Pune Rural police, teams of Pune city, Government Railway Police, Pune, New Mumbai, Thane City and Rural, Palghar, Raigad, Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Solapur Rural and City police participated in the camp. The photographs will be displayed at camp till July 12.
 
 Vishwas Nangre-Patil, inspector general of police (Kolhapur range), who inaugurated the exhibition, said that since morning about seven people have identified their missing or dead relatives. “We have displayed about 4,915 photographs of missing persons and 1,881 photographs of bodies, which are yet to be identified since the last five years,” Nangare-Patil said.
 
 Nangre-Patil said the exhibition will also help in ascertaining the identities of 103 people who were murdered. “All the investigation officers should minutely go through the photographs so that they could get some leads,” Nangre-Patil said.
