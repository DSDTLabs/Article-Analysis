KOLKATA: Confusion, terror and violence took centre stage for several hours on the campus of a premier government-run hospital in the heart of the city on Tuesday as law-keepers struggled to keep a bloodthirsty mob at bay, newborns’ moms fled with babies in their arms and doctors and nurses locked themselves inside a ward.

  nurses first tried to lock themselves in on the second floor of the   building as Saraswati Naskar’s family started protesting against the theft around 1.30pm.
 
 Several mothers, seeing the pandemonium, left their beds and ran out of the hospital with their babies in their arms as the first person to get the treatment from Naskar’s kin was a ward boy. Soon, doctors, too, were seen running away from the second floor. Newborns’ moms, who stayed inside, cowered in fear as they waited for cops to arrive.
 
 “It was absolute panic,” Jangipara resident  , whose wife was inside the ward, said. “My wife was admitted in the same ward where the theft occurred and we just fled with our baby in her arms,” he added. “She was anyway supposed to be discharged in the afternoon but the doctors said they had no idea when they would be able to let her go after completing the process. So we left around 4.30pm.”
 
 Several other patients followed suit by late afternoon as word about an impending mob attack spread. The fears came true a couple of hours later when   supporters took out a rally on the hospital campus and converged in front of the Eden Hospital building around 6pm. As if on cue, those accompanying the Naskar family tried to force their way into the ward. Police resisted them and the mob first vented ire on hospital furniture and fire extinguishers before targeting vehicles on Central Avenue. The traffic disruption continued well past 8pm.
