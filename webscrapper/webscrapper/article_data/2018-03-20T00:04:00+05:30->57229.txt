Pune: The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) is now investigating the possible link between the 10 Bangladeshi immigrants arrested from Pune and Raigad over the last few days and the planting of two high-intensity bombs at Bodh Gaya during the Dalai Lama’s visit on January 19.

 Atulchandra Kulkarni, the state ATS chief, told TOI over the phone on Monday: “We are probing whether these immigrants had a role in the terror activity at Bodh Gaya. For now, we haven’t found a concrete lead.”
 
 On the recovery of fake documents like Aadhaar and PAN cards from the arrested immigrants, Kulkarni said, “The fake documents are a matter of concern. We will take up this issue with the concerned government authorities.”
 
 The ATS and the military intelligence authorities have been working in tandem ever since they were tipped-off by the West Bengal police about the presence of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in the interior parts of the country, including Pune and other parts of Maharashtra. The coordinated exercise resulted in the arrests in Pune and Raigad and, prima facie, these immigrants are suspected of having provided shelter to members of the outlawed Ansarullah Bangla Team. One of the immigrants was working as a mason at an army quarters construction site in the vicinity of an army academic and training institution in Pune.
 
 Intelligence sources said militants from the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) had planted improvised explosive devices in Bodh Gaya as part of a plot to avenge the alleged atrocities committed on the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar by the Buddhists.
 
 A senior ATS officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “The JMB is supported by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence. Many JMB operatives have migrated to India. Most have taken shelter in West Bengal and Assam. A significant number of Bangladeshi immigrants have settled in coastal Maharashtra. It is imperative to take action against illegal immigrants to avoid untoward events.”
