 Matt Willis says he will warn his children that   are dangerous but would never ban them from experimenting. 

  
  
 The Busted rocker - who has  , seven,  , five, and  , nine months, with wife  , has himself been to rehab numerous times in the past, but would like his children to learn the lesson on their own. "I've thought about that quite a lot. I don't think there's anything I can do. If they're going to take drugs, they're going to take drugs. 
 
 "I can tell them why I think certain things are dangerous, but do I want them not to smoke weed at college and go to parties and have great times with their friends? I don't know if I want to be that guy. I want them to live their lives and find it our for themselves," Willis said.
