Sakthi Chidambaram’s   not only marks Bollywood actress Adah Sharma’s acting debut in  , but also her singing debut. We hear the girl has recently recorded the title track of the film, which also stars Prabhudheva, Prabhu and  .

 A source in the know tells us, “Adah has learnt classical music and often uploads videos of her singing and dancing on social media. During one such live interaction with her followers online, she had sung a song from her Telugu film, Heart Attack. That’s when a few members from the unit of Charlie Chaplin 2 heard her sing and soon, producer Siva and director Sakthi asked her to record the title track. Amrish has composed the song, which is an out-and-out dance number. It has already been picturised on the cast.” 
 
 The number is special for Adah also because she has rendered it in her mother tongue, Tamil. The source adds, “Her roots are from here, but she was raised in Mumbai. She knows Tamil quite well and it was easier for her to grasp the lyrics and get the pronunciation of the words right.”
