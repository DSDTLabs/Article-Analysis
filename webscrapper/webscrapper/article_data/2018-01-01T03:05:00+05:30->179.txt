Guntur: Poor maintenance of the toilets in schools is forcing most of students, particularly in rural areas, to keep away from the laterines.

 While not having dedicated water supply is the main reason for toilets generating stink, the toilets with water supply too are not being maintained due to non-availability of funds. Sources said the state government is releasing around Rs 4,000 per annum for the upkeep of the school toilets forcing the head masters (HM) to compromise on maintenance. In majority schools, the HMs are asking the students to keep the toilets clean whenever they use it and avoid periodical cleaning by a manual scavenger. “We can’t engage a scavenger with Rs 300 to Rs 350 per month to keep the toilet clean. We are using the little available funds to clean the toilets during the visits of senior officials and VIPs,” a school head master admitted.
 
 Sources said 55% rural schools have water supply facility in toilets. A school teacher said non-maintenance of toilets, particularly during the summer months, is making it difficult to reuse them after schools reopen. Sources, however, said the government is granting Rs 20,000 to each school under different heads such as building maintenance grant, toilets grant and teacher grant. While the teacher grant should be used for purchase of chalk pieces and dusters, remaining fund should be used for the upkeep of the school. “HMs should take the cooperation of the local panchayats or mandal parishads to engage scavengers,” said student union leader.
