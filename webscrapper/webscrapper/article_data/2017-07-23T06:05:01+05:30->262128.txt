SHIMLA: With the ‘Justice for Gudiya’ campaign gathering steam on  , the photographs of the minor schoolgirl from Kotkhai in Shimla, who was gang-raped and killed early this month, are also being widely shared on social networking sites.
 
 

 Section 228-A of the Indian Penal Code makes disclosure of the identity of a victim or survivor in sexual assault cases a punishable offence. Those who violate the law are liable to be punished with either simple or rigorous imprisonment for up to two years. If the victim is dead, or if the survivor is of unsound mind or a minor, the next of kin have to give it in writing that they were ok with the identity being made public. The girl, a student of class 10, had gone missing on July 4.
 
 
 
 
  Her naked body was recovered from a forest area on July 6. Soon, a photograph of her body was circulated on Facebook and WhatsApp followed by another photograph of her in school uniform.
 
 
 
 
  Meanwhile, CBI has taken over the probe into alleged gang rape and murder, and the custodial death of one of the accused.
