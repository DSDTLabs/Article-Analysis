GURUGRAM: Two men were booked for allegedly attempting to   a 40-year-old   woman and also molesting her two   on Sunday night after forcibly entering their house in Sultanpur village near Farrukhnagar. 

 According to the police, the incident took place around 9.30 pm on Sunday when the woman along with her daughters (aged 16 and 13 years) were in their home. The complainant’s husband was not at home. 
 
 The woman in her complaint said, “The duo, who are from the upper caste, started abusing us the minute they walked in. First they tried to rape me, but I managed to free myself from their clutches. They were drunk. They then attacked my daughters and started molesting them. I ran out of home and raised an alarm to alert our neighbours who came to our rescue. The duo managed to flee by then.”
 
 The woman then informed her husband, who went to the accused’s home the next day to inform their families about their ill deeds. Apparently the families shooed them away saying that the men hadn’t done anything wrong. 
 
 The man along with his wife approached the cops on Monday evening and filed a complaint against the duo. An FIR has been registered under sections 452 (house trespassing), 376-511 (rape attempt) of the IPC, sections 8 (sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Section 3 of SC/ST Act against the accused. 
 
 “The complainant has identified the accused who are residents of the same village. We are verifying the allegations and as per the law, arrests will be made,” said Tanya Singh, ACP (Pataudi).
