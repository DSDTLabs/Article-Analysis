CHENNAI: Contrary to claims that services are being extend to the city’s suburbs, official data reveals that   ( ) has terminated government bus services to Tambaram, Guduvanchery and   over the past four months.

 Services of bus number PP21, between the Madras high court and Guduvanchery, have been completely stopped. 
 
 A complaint was filed in connection with this by C R Balaji, a regular MTC user from the suburbs, but there has been no response from the authorities. This bus service, running through Chepauk, Adyar, Guindy and Tambaram, served as a lifeline for thousands of students, office-goers and residents. 
 
 Besides this, MTC has also cut down bus services plying between core areas such as  ,   and Mylapore to Chengalpet, said Balaji. “As a result, suburban residents in south Chennai are left in the lurch, particularly during peak hours,” he said.
 
 Commuters from north Chennai too have filed similar complaints with concerned authorities but in vain. RS Babu, secretary of   MMDA Residents’ Welfare Association said buses scheduled along route number 164 (between Perambur and MMDA Mathur) were no longer being operated. This was the only public mode of transportation connecting MMDA Mathur with Perambur bus terminus, which serves as a switch-over point, he said. This service was inaugurated by late chief minister J Jayalalithaa after repeated requests from residents. 
 
 The cutting down of services comes right after a series of meetings involving top MTC officials to boost their crumbling revenue. 
 
 Though MTC predicted that the increase in bus fare would bring them more revenue, the average footfall has come down by 30% during weekdays, according to official data.
