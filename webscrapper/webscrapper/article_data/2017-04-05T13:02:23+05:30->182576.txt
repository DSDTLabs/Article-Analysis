 Taking this a step ahead, the   actress recently wrote a letter to her school, Mata Jai Kaur Public School, and  , Guru Tegh Bahadur Institute of Technology in New Delhi, urging the authorities to introduce self defense coaching classes for young girls there. According to Taapse, this will enable girls in 
 learning to take care of themselves through self defense at an early age.
 
 
  
 She has also offered to help out for this initiative. “I think with the current situation it’s important to empower girls from a young age and I feel everyone should know self 
 defence, irrespective of gender. One should be strong and be able to take care of oneself, should a need arise. A change always starts with small steps and for me reaching out to my school was it. The idea isn’t just to make them learn combat, but also understand the importance of   and know when to utilise it.”
 
 Considering Taapsee’s suggestion, the principal of her school shared the letter with the management and they are introducing self defence and karate training in the school. A professional trainer, who will coach the students during the upcoming vacation, has also been enrolled.
