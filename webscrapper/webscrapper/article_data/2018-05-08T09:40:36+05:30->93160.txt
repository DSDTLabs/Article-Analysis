CHENNAI: In a bid to prevent students from taking extreme steps due to failure in examinations, a PIL has sought Madras   to direct the government to instruct all the schools to hand over the results of board exams directly to parents, instead of publishing them in newspapers or websites.

 In his petition, A   of Chennai said results of public examinations conducted by government for Class 10, 11 and 12 were usually published in newspapers and websites directly. On seeing results, some of students who fail to clear them are distressed and some even commit suicide.
 
 Therefore, in order to prevent such tragedies results could be directly handed over to parents of such students through parent-teacher meeting, and counselling could be provided to students who failed to clear the exams, the petitioner said.
 
 Claiming that he had given representation on the issue to authorities concerned on April 14, he said it had been put in cold storage, the petitioner wanted the court to interfere and direct the government to take appropriate decision on the issue.
 
 This apart, the petitioner has also sought the court to pass an interim injunction preventing the government from publishing the results of the public examinations conducted in 2017-18. The PIL is likely to be taken up for hearing by a vacation bench on Wednesday. tnn
