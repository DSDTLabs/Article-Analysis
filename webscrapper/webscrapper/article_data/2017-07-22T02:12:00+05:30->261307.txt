Visakhapatnam: The idea of coming up with a   lights manufacturing unit with the help of Integrated Tribal Development Agency occurred to B Tech graduate K Veera Lakshmi to empower tribal women with employment. She teamed up with 40 tribal women to form Rampa Girijana Mahila Samakhya Industrial Cooperative Society Ltd at Rampachodavaram, East Godavari for manufacturing LED bulbs. The qualifications of tribal women range from Intermediate to B Tech but they have been left unemployed due to the lack of exposure and opportunities. In a bid to make the unit run successfully, its workers had a three-month training on electricity at a local centre. They learnt the basics of LED lights, including assembling the bulbs in one month. Lakshmi, chief executive of the unit said, “Tribal Women Installed LED in ITDA of Eastgodavari (twilite), was formed in July last year. We started with LED bulbs and then took to making panel lights and LED street lights. We have already manufactured around two lakh bulbs and supplied it to APEPDCL. The streets in east Godavari district are lit with the LED bulbs manufactured in our unit.” “ITDA made the initial Rs 40 lakh investment for the project with zero interest. We got Rs 50 lakh each from Andhra Bank and ITDA as financial grant under 'start up stand up India’ with an interest of 12 per cent ,” said the woman entrepreneur who put on display the products of her unit at the regional industry meeting, held by the Federation of Andhra Pradesh Industries recently. Lakshmi opened a store in East Godavari. She said to have employed 30 more tribal women with her business scaling greater heights.
