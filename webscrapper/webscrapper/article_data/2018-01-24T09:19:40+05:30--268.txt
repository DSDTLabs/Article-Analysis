SHILLONG: A large number of people braved the early morning chill to pay tributes to Netaji   on the occasion of his 121st birth anniversary, with a large gathering in front of the life-sized statue of Bose at the state central library premises. Leaders of the Greater Shillong Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Birth Celebration Committee spoke on the occasion. 

 The president of the committee, Naba Bhattarcharjee, United Democratic Party (UDP) members   and Paul Lyngdoh, apart from former   Manas  , recalled the love Bose had for the people of the northeast. Bhattarcharjee said, "People may disagree, but Jawaharlal Nehru was the Prime Minister of the Indian dominion under the British rule, but Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was the first Prime Minister or President of India because in 1944, he hoisted the national flag."
 
 UDP member Bindo Lanong stated that Bose was a friend of the Khasi people. He said, "Bose had said that if people want to see true democracy, they should go to the hills of the northeast. He was a man who sympathized with the movement led by JJM Nichols Roy to get the sixth schedule for the state."
