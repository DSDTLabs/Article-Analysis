GURUGRAM: Five under-construction buildings and boundary walls around 20 plots — all built illegally — were razed to the ground at   village on the outskirts of the city on Tuesday. The   of the  , with the help of local police, freed around seven acres from unauthorised encroachments during the crackdown that continued for around three hours. 

 District town planner (enforcement) Rajendra T Sharma said the   was carried out in an   developed right opposite the primary health centre at Garhi Harsaru, located near Kherki Daula village. 
 
 “This unauthorised colony was developed without obtaining any permission (change of land use) from the authorities. Hence, show-cause notices were issued to the land owners around 15 days ago under the Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas Restriction of Unregulated Development Act, 1963. However, they did not stop construction, and thus, we had to carry out the demolition drive,” Sharma maintained.
 
 According to him, the locality also comes under the Control Area Act, under which no construction activity is allowed in the area without necessary approval from the town and country planning department.
 
 “Similar drives will be carried out in different pockets of the district in coming months to prevent setting up of unauthorised colonies,” said assistant town planner (ATP) Narendra Kumar.
