Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be in Nagpur on April 14 for a slew of programmes. While the visit was announced during Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’s visit to the city on Tuesday, the schedule is yet to be finalized. Party sources said Modi would inaugurate Mahagenco’s 3,230MW plant at Koradi and also commission a generation unit each at Chandrapur and Parli. Since April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dalit icon Babasaheb Ambedkar, Modi would also be visiting Deekshabhoomi and sending a message to the sizeable community in the state. A formal inauguration of Air India’s MRO is also likely to take place on the same day. Modi is also likely to address a public meeting at Mankapur indoor stadium. Party sources said Fadnavis held a meeting at his Ramgiri residence to plan for PM’s visit.  The last time Modi visited city was 2 1/2 years ago when he laid the stone for the Metro Rail project.
