MUMBAI: The   has sanctioned around Rs 20 crore each for a facelift of iconic stations,   on Central Railway and   on Western Railway, which will be carried out by December 2018.

 Board chairman Ashwani Lohani has written to all general managers providing a list of stations to be taken up for  . A senior WR official said, “We will appoint a consultant to prepare a plan after which work will begin.” 
 
 CR will follow the same procedure. A CR official said, “We plan to carry out improvement of the surface at all eight platforms at CSMT. Improvement of the circulating area will also be undertaken. We also plan to give fresh coat of paint wherever possible on the inside of the roof. There will also be better signage and illumination. We may provide escalators on some more platforms too.”
 
 On WR, there are plans to improve the circulating area as the insides of the station are well-maintained. There are also plans for green patches and rezoning of parking areas. Approach roads will also be improved.
 
 Mumbai’s stations fared poorly in cleanliness ratings for stations across the country in May 2017. The only heartening performance was of Bandra Terminus, which was ranked 15, as against 60 earlier. CSMT’s overall ranking dropped from 129 to 153 and A1category rank from 30 to 44. 
 
 CSMT, among the world’s busiest stations, has poor access to basic necessities like water, food and urinals, and there is only one toilet block for mainline and suburban commuters.
 
 Mumbai Central’s overall rank dropped to 27, as against 5, whereas in overall ranking it touched 21, from the previous year’s 86.
 
 Commuter Rajesh Mehra said, “Compared to Churchgate, CSMT has poor aesthetics. It is not well-maintained. There are no benches for senior citizens and the physically challenged to rest till a train arrives.”
 
 Sandesh More, another commuter, said, “The pavement outside platform 1 is uneven. Also, the entrance is unclean.”
