With obesity becoming a major problem across the world, governments, organizations and people are taking special initiatives to do their bit for the cause.
Considering that India features in the top five countries battling obesity, it makes sense for such an exercise to be practiced here as well. Model-fitness promoter   is already on it. At a recent event in the city, those who wanted a selfie with him had to first do pushups — 20 for men and 10 for women. “Since last September, I haven’t been taking any pictures unless the people earn it by doing pushups. Sustained efforts can help people become aware. For example, I have heard that the Singapore government conducts physical tests and gives fit people money as reward. In India, an insurance company has reduced the premium for fit people. The government here can do its bit by reducing taxes for people who exhibit a certain degree of fitness. All this will create a certain mindset, which is beneficial for the society at large,” says Milind.
 A pop-up store in London, which was in operation last month, only accepted payment in the form of exercise. The café encouraged sedentary city people to be fit by inculcating some exercise in their daily life. Once you placed an order at the café, you received a receipt with the exercise that you need to do to earn the food. It is typically a six-minute high-intensity workout that consists of one minute each of rowing, sit-ups, cycling, squats, lunges and jogging on a treadmill, each followed by 30-second rest period. Only once you have completed all the exercises in the presence of a trainer can you chose from their healthy menu.
 But why just stop at food? The next time you visit  , you could get a free ride on the subway if you do 30 squats. In 2013, Moscow — as part of promotion for the Winter Olympics in Sochi — had also allowed complimentary subway rides in exchange for 10 squats.
