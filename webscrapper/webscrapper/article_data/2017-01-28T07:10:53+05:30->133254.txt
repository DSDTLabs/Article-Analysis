 “We are probing if there were other reasons behind the attack, including a property dispute,” said a Jadavpur PS cop. 
 
 Victim Srabanti Sen has been working for animals for the past 26 years. “I now keep a stray dog at my place, besides a disabled Spitz, a Labrador and 15 cats. On January 20, four of my neighbours, who have access to my terrace, locked out my domestic help along with one of the dogs. I had to call the Jadavpur police to rescue them and then, lodged a complaint,” she claimed. On January 21, Sen lodged a second complaint after the neighbours allegedly filmed her and her help. “Finally on Republic Day, I was walking my dogs around 6am when four neighbours, related to each other, attacked me, grabbed me by the hair and kept yelling, ‘tor kukur posha amra dekhe nebo (we will see how you keep those dogs)’. They then suddenly threw boiling water on my hand,” said Sen, who works with Debasree Roy Foundation. Sen again lodged a complaint but by the time the police arrived, the main accused had fled.
 
 The neighbours claimed Sen had attacked them with blades when asked to clam down her barking dogs. Cops said they received complaints from both sides.
