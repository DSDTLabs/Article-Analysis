Namakkal: The Namakkal-based egg exporters have come out with another demand to rollback quarantine health certificate and testing fees, which were increased by the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory (HSADL), a central laboratory, in Bhopal. They have also requested the ministry of commerce and industries to support egg exports by reducing the fees.  “HSADL is an autonomous body under the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR). It is raising the fees on its own,” said Mohan Kumaramangalam, president, Livestock and Agri Farmers Trade Association (LIFT). He said the fees hike will not support the central government’s foreign trade policy on boosting the exports of farm products.  The lab authorities charged Rs 26,966 to test 20 samples, which have to be repeated every 21 days, in 2014. It was hiked to Rs 43,840 in 2015. “After GST implementation, it has been revised to Rs 55,400,” Mohan Kumaramangalam said. A farmer has to spend Rs 9,62,904 annually as fixed cost for getting health certificate irrespective of export volume. “This hike became a shock to the farmers. It has puts farmers once again into the burden of doing business,” said S Selvaraj, an exporter.  The poultry farms in Namakkal region export eggs to Middle East countries like Oman every day. The exporters can export their eggs individually after getting approval from the veterinary and quarantine officials of the concerned government’s Director General of Animal Health, after inspection. As per the stipulated requirement, each individual farms are being monitored by the department of animal health and poultry disease laboratory. Based on the test results for each individual exporting farm, international health certificates are issued by the department of animal quarantine and veterinary services.
