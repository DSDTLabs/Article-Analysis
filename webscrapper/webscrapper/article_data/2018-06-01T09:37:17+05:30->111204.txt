How did early humans first enter the Americas?

 
 After crossing into  , the   adventurers may have trekked along two routes: either by foot through the interior of present day Canada through a grassy passageway between two large ice sheets, or they moved south along the Pacific Coast.
 
 Scientists have debated the two theories, and support for the coastal route has grown from archaeological finds, such as 13,000 year old footprints on an island in  .
 
 “We’re not definitively saying they took the coastal route,” said  , a graduate student at the University at Buffalo and lead author of the study. “We have some of the first direct evidence that that was something that could be done.” The finding, published in the journal ‘Science Advances’, supports the theory that the first people to populate the Americas were seafarers travelling from island to island.
 
 After analysing a large gray boulder Lesnek spotted in a grassy valley in southeastern Alaska, the team concluded the islands had been covered by ice sheets up until about 15,000 to 17,000 years ago. The finding suggests that the glaciers covering that part of the Pacific Coast melted and possibly created a pathway for humans.
 
 The dating coincides with recently discovered archaeological and genetic evidence that suggests the first pulse of human migration into the Americas was around 16,000 years ago, the team said. The team also dated some seal bones that had been previously discovered in a coastal cave and found that the animals were present around 17,000 years ago. The bones suggested that people found food on the coastal route.
 
 An author of the study said it only looked at 10% of the entire coastal corridor, and that future work will aim to apply the same dating methods on other parts of the route.
