VADODARA: Godhra-based   ( ) cancelled the exams for selection of junior clerk, senior clerk and assistant registrar on Monday after ruckus broke out during exams on Sunday.

 Several candidates who took up exam for junior clerk had alleged that the registrar of SGGU Dr   was helping a candidate identified as Harsh Pandya in answering the questions during the final minutes of the exam. 
 
 SGGU vice-chancellor Dr   had promised the candidates on Sunday that he will check the CCTV footages and will not declare the results of the exam until the issue was resolved.
 
 But, after receiving several representations from the candidates and their parents on Monday, the varsity decided to cancel the exam and go for re-examination. “We informed state education minister   about the cancellation of the exam and have also told him about the incident,” said Padaliya.
 
 Defending himself Joshi had said that a candidate had doubt about one of the questions and had approached him. Padaliya told TOI that he will also write to the government to conduct an independent probe by an authorized person to avoid any bias.
