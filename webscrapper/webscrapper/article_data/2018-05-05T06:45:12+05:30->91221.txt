NEW DELHI: Haryana’s embarrassingly skewed sex ratio at birth seems to be showing signs of improvement, with the administration claiming a jump of 38 points between 2015 and December 2017.

 
 While the 2011 census put Haryana’s sex ratio at birth (SRB) at a poor 830 girls per 1,000 boys, in 2017, the SRB, as per chief registrar of births and deaths, stood at 914 girls per 1,000 boys.
 
 The data was presented at a national consultation organised by the women and child development ministry on the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (BBBP) programme here.
 
 BBBP was launched in 2015 by PM   from   in  . The data for Panipat shows SRB increased from 833:1000 in 2011 to 892:1000 in 2015. It went up further to 893:1000 in 2016 and 945:1000 in 2017.
 
 According to data trend shared at the conference, SRB in Haryana rose from 876:1,000 in 2015 to 902:1,000 in 2016 and then went up further to 914:1000 in 2017.
 
 District wise break-up reflect trends that have some extremes like it is claimed that Yamunanagar’s SRB has gone up by 75 points to 943:1,000 in 2017 from 2015 .
