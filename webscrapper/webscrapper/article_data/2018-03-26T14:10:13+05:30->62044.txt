It chokes pipelines resulting in inundation," said a top GHMC official.

"The water results in potholes, which further inconveniences commuters," he said.
 
 Activists say rampant plastic use in the city harms animals as they tend to ingest waste material.

Activists have demanded stringent action be taken against manufacturers of plastic instead of retail establishments to curb the menace.
