Unlike Kukkarahalli Lake, we have not taken up any development work that could harm the flora and fauna of the lake. To strengthen islands, where most of the birds form nests, we have taken up stone-pitching work. So far there has been no opposition to the desilting work.”
  
  A bird watcher,   V, says, “Karanji Lake is a bio-diversity hot spot, but the equipment used to desilt the lake is not exclusively made for desilting, which might cause irreversible damage to the lake. If the monsoon fails this year as well, the lake will surely dry up.”
