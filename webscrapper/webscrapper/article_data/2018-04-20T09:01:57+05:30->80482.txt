KOLKATA: Grandmaster   was the lone Indian to make it to the Rest of the World (RoW) side that played a two-day team event against China in the Lee Hai Cup last week. 

 The 10-round event was played under the Scheveningen system, where each member faced everyone in the opposition twice. Although the strong Chinese side overcame Rest of the World11-9, Vidit gained some valuable experience in a team event before the   Olympiad that is scheduled later this year. The Indian made the RoW squad based on a string of good performances which helped him break into the world’s top 30.
 
 
 “The lowest-rated player in their (China) team was higher rated than our best player. So we went into the match as underdogs,” Vidit told ToI on Thursday.
 
 Vidit, though, felt the Rest team failed to perform to its potential. “As a team we didn’t play very well. Overall, they played much more consistently and that’s why they won,” the Nashik lad confessed.
 
 The former national champion wasn’t satisfied with his own show either. “Well, to put it mildly, I didn’t perform up to my expectations. I scored 4.5 out of a possible 10 which was not very encouraging,” informed Vidit, who drew seven, won one and lost two of his 10 games. Analysing his performance, the 23-year-old said he did badly in the rapid format. “The problem was the rapid format. I hadn’t played too many rapid games and it took me some time to get used to the format,” he said.
 
 Irrespective of the results, Vidit was happy with the experience he gained. “I only see the positives. It definitely helps to face stronger players and now I have a better idea of the level of opposition I’ll face in the upcoming Olympiad. It was kind of a warm-up for the big event,” Vidit remarked.
