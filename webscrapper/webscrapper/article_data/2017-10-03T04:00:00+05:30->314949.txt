Surat:  ,000 from one of them when they went to the slums to check on those involved in bootlegging activity. 

 Police have identified 12 people in the complaint but no arrests have been made so far. “We have identified only 12 people from their first names. We are working to identify all those who had attacked the police team,” police said. 
 
 A team comprising three policemen was on patrol duty to keep an eye on illicit liquor trade in the slums near the railway track. The bootleggers came to know about the arrival of the policemen and soon their group began to throw stones at them. No policeman was hurt in the attack. Head constable Gulamayuddin Nizamuddin was making a video of the attackers on his mobile phone when it was snatched away by one of the miscreants. 
 
 “Bootleggers and drug peddlers frequent the slums near the railway track. We are doing regular patrolling in the area. The criminals are finding it difficult to do business due to continuous pressure from police. A police team noticed that some people were selling liquor and when the cops went to check, a mob began to throw stones at them on Sunday,” police said.
 
 In the past too, police teams had been attacked at these slums by anti-social elements involved in bootlegging and ganja racket. These slums have become a hub for ganja trading and distribution due to their proximity to the railway track. Ganja consignments used to reach these slums in the past on a regular basis from outside the state through train. Then, the ganja was distributed to other parts of the city from these slums. Similarly, some people here were using trains to transport liquor from Daman.
