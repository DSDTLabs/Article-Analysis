 The Aasu had termed the decision a violation of the three-language formula mentioned in the national policy on education which states that non-Hindi speaking students should learn Hindi along with a regional language and English. Aasu has asked the state to take an initiative so that Assamese can be promoted in schools affiliated to other boards.
