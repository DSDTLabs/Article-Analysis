HUBBALLI: In a bid to encourage cashless transactions, the union oil ministry on January 3 announced that   would get a Rs 5 discount on every refill, which was booked and paid for online. However, those who tried to pay their bills using net banking facility had to cough up Rs 7 to Rs 8 as transaction charge to get the Rs 5 discount.

 Sunil Nalavade, a   consumer, said that he had to cough up Rs 7 as transaction charge. “When they announce a rebate, the ministry and the departments concerned should think twice. To get a five-rupee rebate, we are spending Rs 7, which means that we are paying two rupees extra. They should at least waive off transaction charges, if they want to facilitate cashless modes of payment for LPG,” Nalavade said.
 
 The situation was no different for Mayur Patil, an   consumer. “I had to pay Rs 8 as transaction charges. This is a misleading announcement by the government," Patil said.
 
 However, Patil pointed out that the transaction charge was just Rs 1.51 for debit card payment. “They also charge 23 paise as service tax," he added.
 
 Secretary of Consumer Protection and Research Foundation, RS Patil Kulkarni dubbed it an unfair trade practice. “I am a   consumer, and had to pay Rs 6.65 as transaction charge. When the government announces such rebates, they should make these things clear,” he added.
 
 Indane Gas field officer SK Ganesan said that the charges were being levied by the banks. Distributor for HP Gas in Navanagar, Hubballi, Basavaraj Halaharvi echoed Ganesan's observations. “We are not even aware when the discount came into effect.While some are saying it's already been implemented, a few are saying otherwise. We are concerned only with delivery . When our consumers book online, we deliver accordingly,” Halaharvi said.
 
 The personnel in charge of the Bharat Gas helpline too said that the banks levied the transaction charges, while the government collected the service tax.
