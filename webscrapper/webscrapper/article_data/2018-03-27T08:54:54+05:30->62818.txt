TUMAKURU:   on Monday gave another twist to the   controversy, saying chief minister Siddaramaiah’s move to accord religious minority status to those professing 12th century social reformer Basavanna’s principles, was to prevent B S   from becoming CM.

 “The   government has brought in this proposal, not because of love for Lingayats, but to prevent Yeddyurappa from becoming CM,” he said, addressing a coconut growers’ convention here, after meeting Siddaganga mutt seer Shivakumar Swami.
 
 “I want to tell the people of Karnataka that if BJP wins a majority, we will make Yeddyurappa the CM,” he added. Shah said the proposal, which was rejected by the UPA-II government in 2013, was only aimed at creating confusion among people. He was confident that Karnataka will not be swayed by “divide and rule” politics.
 
 The BJP has decided to go with the Veerashiava Mahasabha, which has opposed the move to give the religious minority tag with a rider.
 
 Shah said suicides in Congress-ruled states are on the increase, but the figure is down in BJP-ruled states like Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. “If you vote for Yeddyurappa, I assure you, farmers’ suicides will come to a halt,” he claimed.

 ‘I FELT I SAW GOD’
 Shah on Monday sought the blessings of 110-year-old seer of Siddaganga mutt Shivakumara Swami, who is also known as the ‘Walking God’, for the party’s success in the assembly polls. “I felt I was seeing God when I met the revered pontiff. I sought his blessings for our party’s success in the state assembly election,” Shah told reporters.
