PATNA: Even as the process of appointment of new   in the state’s   may take some time, the outgoing VCs and pro-VCs, who will be completing their three-year term by the end of the current month, are unlikely to get extension.
 
  According to sources, the senior most dean or senior most professor of the university concerned will be asked by the chancellor to officiate as the VC till the time new full-time VCs are appointed on the recommendation of search committees.
  
  The   has already requisitioned the names of senior most deans and professors from all the universities and inquired about vigilance inquiry, if any, pending against them. It is learned these teachers have also been asked individually to spell out whether they are facing any criminal case.
  
  Sources said the senior most professors might be handed over the charge of the VC’s office after the end of the tenure of the present incumbents. Earlier in 2013 also, the   had to revise its order on appointing the senior most dean as the officiating VC when cases of some irregularities in fixation of seniority were pointed out. Moreover, as the post of deans is rotational, there may be some junior teacher serving as dean of a faculty.
  
  The chancellor’s secretariat will have to give some extra time in finding out the senior most teacher as the seniority list of some universities is not fool proof. It is said that some universities have reportedly adopted pick and choose policy in sending the list of senior most teachers to the Raj Bhawan.
  
  Meanwhile, the process of appointment of VCs and pro-VCs in these universities is also in progress. The search committees for all the universities have been constituted and the committee members are being contacted by the chancellor’s secretariat for their availability. The applications have been screened and eligible candidates would be shortlisted by the respective search committees for interaction shortly.
