IDUKKI: Advice given by an astrologer is thought to be behind the suicide of a man and a woman, whose bodies were found near   on   border on Tuesday. 

 The man's family wanted the marriage to be cancelled after an astrologer said 'ominous' horoscope of the bride would result in death of bridegroom.
 
  The decomposed bodies of   (35) and G Manjula (30) were recovered on Monday from a car found floating on PAP (Parambikulam-Aliyar Project) canal near Udumalpet. Arun, son of  , is a native of Udumalpet and Manjula, daughter of  , is a native of Revenue Nagar, near Udumalpet.
 
  The marriage of   and Manjula was fixed a month ago, but the parents of Arun learnt that Manjula was earlier engaged to a youth and he had died in an accident last year. An astrologer convinced them that due to the nature of Manjula's horoscope, Arun will face the same fate after marriage. This led them to call off the marriage, despite stiff resistance from the youngsters.
 
  After finding Manjula missing, her father filed a complaint with Udumalpet police station on February 23. Arun was running a wheel balancing service for cars and   was a school teacher.
 
  "We registered a case and were investigating. As per the statement by Arun's father, they had requested to postpone the marriage by six months and did not cancel it. We have no information about the astrologer's direction to cancel the marriage," said the police.
