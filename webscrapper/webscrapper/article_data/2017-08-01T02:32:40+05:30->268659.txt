NEW DELHI/GURUGRAM: The mystery of   appears to be getting curiouser by the day. Could it be a group of   at work, or is it just the handiwork of some pranksters? Another theory doing the rounds is that a   may be involved.

 Police are still searching for answers. They suspect that a group of occult practitioners from a Gurugram village may be drugging the women and then chopping off their braids. They feel that the gang may be trying to divert attention from their illegal activities. 
 
 Police have surmised that the miscreants use some spray to make their targets unconscious. However, all three victims have claimed that they were sleeping with doors locked from inside.
 
 A police officer said a few cases of theft had also been reported in the area over the last few days, raising suspicion that the thieves might be responsible for chopping off the women’s hair as well.
 
 The ‘Phantom Barber’ scare, meanwhile, has gripped Gurugram too, with braids of three women chopped off in the last 24 hours. According to one of the victims, Sapna, she was woken up from her sleep when she saw a cat enter her room. She claimed that cat soon transformed into a woman and pounced upon her.
 
 “I fell unconscious after this. When I woke up, I saw my braid was cut,” said Sapna.
