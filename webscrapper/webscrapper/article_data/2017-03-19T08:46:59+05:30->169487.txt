Udupi: District   on Saturday directed officials to permit removal of sand in   to ensure availability of sand for construction purpose.

 The minister directed Kumar, official of the department of mines and geology, to clarify on the issue of constituting the new committee and also return the royalty paid by 170 permit holders who had done so during 2016-17. Directing DC Priyanka Mary Francis to empower assistant commissioners to identify traditional fishermen, the minister instructed the officials to check their Aadhaar card, voter ID and current residential address before permitting them to remove sand.
 
 DC Priyanka Mary told STOI that the NGT order and MoEF directions are very clear about removal of sand in CRZ areas and the district administration will follow the same in toto. “There is no scope for mining sand mechanically and sand deposited in sand bars has to be removed manually,” she said. G Anuradha, additional DC, Shilpa Nag CT, assistant commissioner, Vishnuvardhan, additional SP, Gurumurthy Kulkarni, RTO and other officials were present.
