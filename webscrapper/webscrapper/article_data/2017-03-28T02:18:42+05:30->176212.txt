NEW DELHI:   would be able to soon tell the   about their   and autorickshaws by merely scanning a quick response (QR) code displayed on stickers in all public transport vehicles. 

 Delhi Police is developing an app for this. Commissioner Amulya Patnaik has formed a team of officers under special commissioner (modernisation and women safety) Sanjay Baniwal to complete the project in a time-bound manner.
 
 “We are planning to hold discussions with the stakeholders, including the Delhi government and Metro, to try this app around Delhi University,” said Baniwal while inaugurating a two-day conference on ‘Safer and Conveninent Taxi Operations in India’ organised by Institute of Road Traffic Education and ministry of road transport and highways. A special control room is being set up for the same. 
 
 The code will have to be pasted behind the front seat of an autorickshaw or a taxi. And drivers will have to tell a passenger to   it at the time of boarding. 
 
 The   monitoring system will read the details of the driver and the vehicle, and track a passenger’s entire journey through GPS. Police officers say this would boost the Himmat app, which will be revamped soon. Trial runs will begin in the next quarter. 
 
 The app can be downloaded from Google Playstore.
