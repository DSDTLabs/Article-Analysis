AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday told the   ( ) to take a decision within two days on changing public prosecutors in the fresh trial that is to be conducted in the controversial murder case of   activist  .

 In June, Justice J B Pardiwala had quashed a trial that was already completed in the Jethava murder case before a CBI judge, and ordered a retrial before a new judge after 105 out of 195 witnesses turned hostile. Jethava’s father, Jethalal, had complained before the CBI court first and then before the HC that the witnesses turned hostile under pressure from accused persons, especially ex-BJP MP from Junagadh, Dinu Bogha Solanki, and his nephew Shiva Solanki.
 
 As the fresh trial was to commence, Jethalal moved the HC again and demanded removal of special prosecutors in his case including L D Tiwari, who has already shifted to New Delhi from Ahmedabad, and used to come city to attend the trial. The petitioner expressed dissatisfaction with the efforts put in by the lawyer in prosecuting the accused, and urged the HC that a change of prosecutor may benefit the trial in the interest of justice.
 
 After hearing Jethalal’s case, Justice Sonia Gokani asked CBI to decide on the change of prosecutors within two days. The HC has posted further hearing on August 2. The CBI court is scheduled to start fresh trial in this case from August 3.
