AHMEDABAD: The Supreme Court’s interim directions for reconstitution of   fixation committees and its setting up the deadline to complete the process to fix provisional fees for private schools has confused the state government further for implementation of its fee regulation law.

  government has approached the apex court to get a clarity on its order on various aspects, the most important being whether the provisional fees to be fixed should be made applicable from the current academic session or from 2018-19.
 
 Education department officials said that upon the advocate general’s advice, the state government has sought a clarity on the SC’s interim order. The apex court has posted proceeding on the government’s request on February 16.
 
 Sources said that the government wants clarity on the SC’s order to fix provisional fees at this stage, but the government is not clear on whether the provisional fees are to be fixed by whom – by schools or by the fee regulatory committees. This confusion has arose after   of Self-financed Schools interpreted the order as private schools have been given liberty to fix the provisional fees at this juncture. Its president Deepak Rajyaguru said, “The court has given the right to us to fix the provisional fee and to post the details on websites.”
 
 Meanwhile, as per the   order the government has invited opinions of all stake holders – school managements, parents’ associations and others – on fixation of slabs of maximum fees to be charged without government’s nod.
 
 As there are various interpretations prevailing on court order besides the delay in implementation of the fee regulation laws amid legal battles, the Ahmedabad district education officer has warned parents about payment of fees for the next academic session as some parents raised complaints against some schools making demand for payment of fees.
