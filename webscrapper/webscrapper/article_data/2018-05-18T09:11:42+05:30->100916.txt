INDORE: People charged or convicted with multiple crimes against women in   will soon lose their driving licences - a move that the district administration believes will act as a deterrent for  . 

 Indore district collector Nishant Warwade on Thursday announced plans to cancel driving licences of habitual offenders convicted for crimes like molestation, rape and dowry harassment, during a meeting held to discuss ways to ensure road safety. 
 
 
 
 
 He said those charged with such crimes may also face action. “We will revoke driving licences of people against whom multiple cases are registered for heinous crimes against women like molestation, rape and dowry harassment,” Warwade told TOI.
 
 He said if the charges are not proven against the accused in the court of law, the licence can be restored again. The collector claimed action will be taken under provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 that empowers the licencing authority to take such action. Section 19 of the Act empowers the licensing authority to disqualify from holding a   or revoke such licence, if it is satisfied, after giving the holder of a driving licence an opportunity of being heard, that he is a habitual criminal or habitual drunkard.
