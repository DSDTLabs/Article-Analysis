 Party leaders decided to dedicate a memorial in the name of the deceased. Virbhadra visited private hospitals in Pathankot, Punjab, and Nurpur, Himachal Pradesh, where 10 survivors of the accident are under treatment. He also met   (10), the kid who climbed up to the road after he fell out from the bus with a jerk. He also visited the spot where he pointed out the need to have barricades, as there was erosion where the bus had rolled down. “I see there is a need of barricades at this point; I would raise this issue with the government,” he said.
