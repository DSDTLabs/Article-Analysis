NEW DELHI: Former international cricketer   earned the disapproval of a small section of ultraconservatives for posting a   photograph showing him playing chess with his son. 

 The game is “haram (forbidden)” in Islam, one of the comments said. However, such remarks were outnumbered by those who complimented the photograph and defended the cricketer.
 
 Kaif had posted the picture on Thursday on his official Facebook page. It was captioned, “Shatranj Ke Khilaadi #fatherson #kabirtales #instaplay”. By 9 pm, the snapshot had received over 16,000 likes, nearly 300 comments and close to 200 shares.
 
 One Anwar Shaikh wrote, “Bhai yeh game harraaam he (Brother, this game is haraam)”. Another observer,   wrote, “I think chess is prohibited in islam..... I used to be a good player bit wen (sic) I read hadeeth I found that it is not to play chess.from that day I never played it.... Mohammad   sir.”
 
 However, most comments kept to focusing on the fatherson bonding. “Masha Allah bless you,” wrote  . Others tried to direct their ire on those calling the board game religiously inappropriate.
 
 “Anything that involves usage of one’s brain is prohibited for some people, because they don’t have a brain to begin with,” wrote Mushtaq Dar.
 
 Kaif is the latest Indian cricketer to join the ranks of   and Irfan Pathan in receiving online disapproval from the orthodox for his choices. 
 
 Last year too, Kaif found himself in a similar brouhaha over a Twitter post featuring pictures of him performing Surya Namaskar.
