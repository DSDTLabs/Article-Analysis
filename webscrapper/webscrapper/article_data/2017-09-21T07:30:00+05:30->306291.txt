Chandigarh: State Transport Authority ( ) impounded two buses and issued challans to three other buses standing outside Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 35 on Wednesday. The bus drivers claimed being associated with the school and one of the buses had GMSSS written on it without any sector mentioned.

 Additional secretary STA Rajiv Tewari said, “These buses were parked outside the school. There were five buses out of which two were impounded for disconnected speed governors and three were challaned for various other violations. We called the vice-principal of the school, who informed us that there is no proper agreement of school buses with the school authorities.”
 
 Despite the bus drivers’ claims, the school authorities rejected any contract signed between the transporter and the school authorities and said the former carried children on their own.
 
 “We will be writing to the director, school education as well as the principal to look into the matter and take appropriate action about the safety of the students using the school buses with the branding of a particular school,” Tewari said.
 
 The school vice-principal Rajan Jain told TOI, “The buses don’t belong to the school. They are parked outside our school but ferry children of different schools. Since this has come to our notice we will be asking the parents, who are in need of school bus facility and provide them the facility through a contractor.”
