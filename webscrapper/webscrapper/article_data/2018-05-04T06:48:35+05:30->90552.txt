MUMBAI: Days after CM   announced at a function that the proposed   would come up at Byculla, a group has opposed the site, saying Urdu Bhavan should be established at Mumbai University’s   Campus.

 In a letter to the CM, Union minister of minority affairs, Mumbai University’s VC and several others, NGO   said that Mumbai University’s Urdu department, since its inception in 1982, has endeavoured to promote exchange of ideas and since all other Bhasha bhavans are at the Kalina campus, it would be imprudent to take the Urdu Bhavan elsewhere. “The previous government had already sanctioned Rs 10 crore and bhoomi pujan was done at Kalina campus. It will be inconvenient for scholars and students to travel to Byculla to attend Urdu Bhavan’s functions,” said Jai Ho Foundation’s general secretary, advocate Adil Khatri.
 
 
 MIM legislator from Byculla advocate Waris Pathan, who had proposed the Urdu Bhavan at Byculla, is livid. “Some unscrupulous elements are trying to stall the proposed Urdu Bhavan at Byculla without understanding that the plan of an Urdu Bhavan at Kalina campus was scrapped by the university,” said Pathan.
