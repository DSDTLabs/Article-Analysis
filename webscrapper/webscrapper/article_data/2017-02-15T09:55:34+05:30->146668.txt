MUMBAI: As expected, the national selectors on Tuesday retained almost the same Indian team which beat Bangladesh in the one-off Test at Hyderabad, for the first two Tests against Australia. The first Test will begin in Pune on February 23, while the second will be held in Bangalore on March 4-8.

 The only man to miss out is leg-spinner  , who had to sit out of the game at Hyderabad after injuring his knee during the third and final T20 International against England at Bangalore. Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav, who was brought in as cover for Mishra, has been retained in the squad.
 
 Undergoing rehabilitation since he suffered a knee injury in December, pacer   has still not recovered, and the selectors would now hope that he returns for the final two Tests in Ranchi (March 16-20) and Dharamsala (March 25-29). Those who do well for India A against the Aussies in the three-day game at the Cricket Club of India (CCI), which begins on Friday, may get a look-in for the later games.
 
 The squad for first two Tests against Australia:
 
 Virat Kohli (Captain), M Vijay, KL Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, W Saha (wk), R Ashwin, R Jadeja, Ishant Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Karun Nair, Jayant Yadav, Kuldeep Yadav,   and Hardik Pandya.
