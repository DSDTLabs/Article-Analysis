 “NRM is all ready to set a benchmark. This event will be the first of its kind and become a trendsetter for other cities. This is a project specially for women and riders and those who are short on time. Every month cycling events of 80 and 120 kms will be held. It is not a race but we have a specific time limit set for the riders. The inaugural NRM will be for 80 kms,” shared Jaspal Singh Virdi, president of Nashik cyclists.
 
 The cyclists will have to complete the distance of 80 kms in four hours and 26 minutes. NRM will be held every second Saturday of the month. For 120 kms the time limit is six hours and 40 minutes. Ride cards will be provided to the riders that have to be stamped at specific check points. 
 
 He said that it was a brand new concept and he hoped that it will gather a fan following soon. Over 60 people have registered on the NRM website and 35 riders have registered for the event. 
 
 “I wanted to do something for women and children in the endurance category. This year the city will see lot of cycling events,” said Jaspal. “Due to demonetisation we are encouraging online registrations and have created a dedicated website for this event,” he said.
