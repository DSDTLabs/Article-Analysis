NEW DELHI: The humble television is no more an idiot box - it has become smart. Buoyed by a fall in data prices and faster internet speeds, TVs are getting 'smarter' as more and more Indians opt for flatpanels that offer a web browser and a host of net-streaming applications such as Facebook, Netflix and YouTube.

 A large number of televisions being sold in the country are so-called 'smart TVs' or those having internet capability, and many of them come pre-loaded with an array of apps as companies work towards the love of Indians for social media and greater online engagements. Samsung,  ,   and even newbies like Intex and Vu are cashing in on the trend, which has also been fuelled by lower prices (12-15%) of smart TVs compared to two to three years ago. "There is 40% growth in sale of smart TVs against 10-12% growth for the overall television category," Rajeev Bhutani, VP of  's Consumer Electronics Business, told TOI.
 
 Companies have been boosting number of products in the smart category, which broadly starts from around Rs 20,000 (for the 32-inch screen) and runs up to Rs 3 lakh and beyond for top-end products such as the QLED flags hip range of   that the company launched recently .
 
 The phenomenon of smart TVs is not just confined to larger metros, but also picking up in smaller towns and Tier II cities, said top officials from Videocon and Sony. "Till about a year back, contribution of smart TVs to overall sales was around12-14%. Now this has gone up to 18-20%," said Sachin Rai, who looks after Sony's Bravia TV range. "The category is on fire, and we expect its share to move up significantly." Sony's 32-inch smart TV costs around Rs 31,000 compared to Rs 35,000 about two years ago.
 
 The price gap between a 'regular' (or non-smart TV) and a smart TV is now only around 20%, said C M Singh, chief operating officer at Videocon. “Earlier it was around 50%.“
