NAGPUR: Though local   is yet to recover from the embarrassment of scheduling an official event on a public holiday ( ) last month, it has repeated the error for Akshaya Tritiya this week.

 STD X teachers’ training was to be held on April 18 but as soon as the officials realized that it’s a holiday, the event was rescheduled. 
 
 A staffer at deputy director of education office told TOI that the training seminar has been rescheduled to April 21. “It was an oversight, not intentional. The training seminar was organized for STD X teachers as the curriculum has been updated and new textbooks are out. We are conducting seminars on different days for different subjects so that all doubts of teachers are cleared,” the official said.
 
 Sharad  , office bearer of  , said that such blunders could have been avoided and added, “Sometimes, official events also clash with local festivals in Nagpur region as the schedule is prepared by those sitting in Pune and Mumbai who don’t have a clue about local customs.”
 
 Bhandarkar said that certain festivals are given more importance than the local festivals and it must change. “Officials must coordinate with the head office and ensure such mistakes don’t happen,” he said. 
 
 Earlier this month, Pune-based headquarters of education department had to roll back yet another teachers’ training seminar because of ‘Vidarbha summer’. The seminars were to be held across the state from 10am to 5pm but the order was modified later due to excessive heat in the region. 
 
 The amended circular clarified that the training will be held only till 2.30pm in Nagpur region, and could be started early in the day.
