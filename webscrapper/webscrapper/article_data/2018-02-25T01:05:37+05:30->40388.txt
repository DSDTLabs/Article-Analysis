 The FIR has also been registered against prominent businessmen including owner of   and Neetu Bajaj and Manik Bajaj. Bajajs are the owners of the house where from Bhinda's other associate   was rounded up earlier today for his involvement in the attack on congress worker who too has been named in the FIR. Apart from these, FIR has been lodged against 50 unidentified persons who too are believed to be involved in the fight.
  
 The incident which occurred today afternoon had raised several questions on security arrangements in the polls as SAD and Congress workers entered into scuffle several times which eventually turned violent later and weapons were also used by some of the persons involved in the fight. Though police had maintained that two shots have allegedly been fired but no proof of these was found prima facie but investigations were on. However, both SAD and Congress leaders had been claiming that none of their workers were involved in the firing. 
 
 However speaking to TOI on registration of FIR against him and his associates Bhinda said, "This is unfortunate, the case has been registered on baseless and false allegations and worst part is that several prominent businessmen too have been booked without any fault of theirs. In fact, It was them (congress) workers who attacked us and fired shots." 
 
 However, earlier in the evening SAD's spokesperson Dr Daljit Singh Cheema released a statement which said, "Ruling Congress party had murdered democracy by resorting to widespread violence and intimidation accompanied with booth capturing and polling of bogus votes during elections to the   today"
