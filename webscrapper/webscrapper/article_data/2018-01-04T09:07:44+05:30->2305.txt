BENGALURU: Just one day after its introduction, the   ( ) has reverted to the old schedule of running trains at an interval of four minutes as opposed to one every 3.5 minutes as per its plans to increase frequency, citing poor response as reason.

 A S Shankar, executive director of operations and maintenance, BMRCL, said they would watch and observe the commuter numbers before taking any long-term decision.
 
 “During morning peak hours on Wednesday, the trains ran as per the new schedule with a 3.5-minute gap on the Purple Line and six-minute gap on the Green Line. But we reverted to the old schedule of trains at four-minute intervals for the evening rush hours. We didn’t see any great increase in the ridership, so we will watch and take a call,” he said.
 
 The decision to increase frequency on the Metro lines came after commuters complained of crammed coaches, especially during peak hours. 
 
 
 
 
 On Tuesday, Metro services were interrupted twice, once in the morning and once in the evening rush hour. In the morning, service was interrupted for almost 30 minutes, whereas the delay in the evening was for six minutes.
 
 According to BMRCL spokesman U A Vasanth Rao, the problem was due to an internal problem with the network. “Something had tripped internally which resulted in intermittent power supply, where it was not stable. The trains were moving, but there was no regular supply. We have generators. but cannot run the trains on that. Our technical wing localized and identified the problem and fixed it on Tuesday night when the service was down,” he said.
 
 Stating that this was out of the ordinary, Rao added that under normal circumstances when there is a grid failure, power is obtained from the next grid in a matter of two minutes.
