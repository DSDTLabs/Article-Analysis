GHAZIABAD: A day after a video showing the newly appointed SHO of Loni being welcomed with a garland of currency notes surfaced, the additional director general of police, Meeurt Zone, Prashant Kumar has ordered an inquiry into the case. The 32-second video showing SHO Umesh Kumar Pandey accepting the garland and posing with locals for the camera is being widely shared on social media since Saturday. 

 Pandey was transferred to Loni police station from the police lines just three days back. When contacted, the SHO in his defence said some locals, who were going to a wedding ceremony, put the currency garland on him, but he later returned it to them.
 
 “An explanation has been sought from the department and I have given my reply. Some locals have come to meet me and during the interaction and put the garland on my neck. There were some people who were standing there who made a video and then put it on the social media. However, I immediately returned it and also rebuked them for their action. I did not know that the entire episode will be taken out of context,” Pandey told TOI.
 
 Sources in the police department said following the incident, officials have been asked to be more alert about their public image and avoid falling into such situations. “Going by the law book, the   has not violated any rule. It was done in his welcome. He did not even know those people. Aren't police officials who work round-the-clock for people deserve some respect? Had it been done regarding a case, action would have definitely been taken against him,” said a police officer.
