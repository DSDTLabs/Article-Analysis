QUETTA: A lawyer in   ended her three-day hunger strike after the country's top general vowed to redouble efforts to protect the   minority, which has been targeted in a string of attacks by Sunni extremists.

  called off her protest before dawn Wednesday following a meeting between Gen.   and leaders from the Hazara community in  , where several Shiites have been gunned down in recent months. Police have yet to arrest any suspects.
 
 According to a military statement,   said those who target Shiites "shall suffer twice as much.''
 
 Sunni extremists view Shiites as apostates, and have carried out scores of attacks over the past two decades that have killed thousands of them.
