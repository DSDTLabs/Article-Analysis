THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Tightening their vigil against   and drugs mafia, the city police have reached out to courier service providers in the city. The police have informed them that they have been inadvertently used by the substance mafia for transport of their stuff and should to be wary of the parcels they handle.

 “It is a fact that the smugglers use parcel services to send small quantities of the stuff to their buyers. But, police do not have resources to detect or track these transactions,” said city narcotic cell assistant commissioner Sheen  .
 
 
  
 The assistant commissioner said that during a meeting with the representatives of courier services the latter were told to employ portable versions of x-ray baggage scanners used at airports and railway stations to scan the packets they receive. This could help them find out whether the packets contain illegal substances and alert the cops. Even if they were unaware of the illegal parcel delivery, if caught, they could also be complicit in the crime.
 
 Tharayil said that the meeting was convened a few days ago after a similar case was reported in   district, where law enforcers seized a consignment that was sent via courier service.
  
 ‘’At present, none of the parcel services operating in the city have scanners. Even if someone sends a bomb through these services, it would go undetected,” the officer said, pointing at a recent incident in Odisha, where a young bride and her grandmother was killed on wedding night after a bomb hidden in a gift packet exploded.
 
 Even though the service providers have understood the seriousness of the situation, they have expressed concern about the feasibility of purchasing x-ray scanners.
 
 In the city too there had been cases in the past in which pirated CDs were smuggled through courier services and even Railway Mail Service.
