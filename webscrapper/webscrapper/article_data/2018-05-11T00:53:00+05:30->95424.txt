A large number of tourists from various places started thronging one of the favourite hill stations, Kodaikanal, for a cool break from the simmering summer. The recent rain has turned the tourist destination even greener. The water level in the star-shaped lake is also up.

 But many tourists complain about the poor condition of roads as well as the unhygienic food. Most of the roads connecting important sightseeing spots in the town are in bad shape. S  , a biker from   in Madurai, who is on his third visit in the last three years, said  , which leads to   temple, is badly damaged. The road leading to   is also in pathetic condition. The condition of the road has been worsening over the years, he opined.
 
 The connecting road between Kodaikanal lake and the observatory has been badly damaged in the recent rain. The bad roads also cause traffic problems, Alaudeen added.
 
 Food is another issue pointed out by the visitors. S Gopi Shankar, who came with his family from Dindigul, said that the price of food and snacks had gone up. "The hotels in the town add colours and many of those who are not aware of this end up with health issues," he said.
 
 A Chitra, a tourist from Coimbatore, said colour powders were added lavishly in snacks like   and Cauliflower Bajji to make them attractive at Silver Falls. Children who had them felt like vomiting, she said.
