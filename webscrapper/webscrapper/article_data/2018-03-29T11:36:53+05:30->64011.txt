NAGPUR: Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Wednesday orally warned the   (MCI) against any reduction in Indira Gandhi Government Medical College’s (IGGMC) 150 MBBS seats.

 A division bench of Justices   and   while adjourning the hearing till Monday, also asked MCI to file a comprehensive affidavit on its recommendations to the Centre to reduce seats. The bench warned apex body for medical education of initiating contempt if it went ahead with its decision to reduce the seats, despite clear HC orders of February 4, 2015, when it had directed the centre not to act upon MCI’s recommendation of reducing the seats.
 
 The warning came while hearing writ petition (No 3427/2000) filed by CH Sharma and others regarding lack of facilities in government medical colleges and hospitals (GMCHs) across Vidarbha. The MCI’s move was brought to HC’s notice by amicus curiae Anup Gilda, who submitted its communication of February 28 to the union health and family welfare ministry’s secretary.
 
 The communication by its secretary S Savitha listed out 13 deficiencies in IGGMC’s function found during inspection. It pointed out that medical superintendent Dr Sandhya Manjrekar had only two years’ experience against requirement of 10 and hence was ineligible to hold the post. The apex body directed the IGGMC administration to remove all deficiencies within a month or face axe in seats numbers.
 
 “MCI executive committee decided to recommend to the centre not to recognize/approve IGGMC’s MBBS course against the increased intake from 100 to 150 seats under Section 11(2) of the IMC Act, 1956, till then,” Savitha said.
