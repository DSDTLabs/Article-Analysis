LUCKNOW: Citing clash between Thakur and Dalit communities in  ,   chief   on Saturday slammed the   government in UP accusing it of not being able to control law and order situation in the state.

 Mayawati is first political leader to have reacted on the incident in which a 35-year-old man from Thakur community was killed and 16 others were injured seriously in a clash in Shabbirpur village in Saharanpur following a dispute over a procession in memory of Rajput ruler Maharana Rana Pratap. In retaliation, members of Thakur community torched at least 21 houses belonging to the Dalits.
 
 In a statement, Mayawati squarely accused the BJP of orchestrating caste clashes for its own political gains. The BSP boss said organising processions without due permission from the state government authorities was becoming a ‘fashion’ in the ruling BJP dispensation.
