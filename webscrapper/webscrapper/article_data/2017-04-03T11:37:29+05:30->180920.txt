After announcing a biopic on badminton ace   in 2015,   spent a year-and-a-half researching the film, flitting between Mumbai and Hyderabad, Saina's hometown, while shooting his upcoming kids action film, 'Sniff'. The exhaustive legwork has left the writer-filmmaker with two terabyte of material on his computer.
"Besides meeting Saina's close associates, I gathered together videos of her to understand her personality. I've also been to the National Sports Club of India (NSCI) to watch her play. Her killer instinct is inspiring, she is the tigress beti of India who has made us proud," says the filmmaker.
 
  
  
 When he met Saina's mother, Usha Rani, for the first time she fed him home-made parathas. "They are simple people and the atmosphere was so homely. The parathas are Saina's favourite and will make it in the biopic too," Amole laughs.
 
 The filmmaker justifies his extensive research by explaining that he wanted to understand the individual that is Saina Nehwal, her values and her champion's instinct. "I have spent days with her, her parents (  and Usha), her mentor,  , and several of her coaches. She was born in Haryana but landed up in Hyderabad. The film begins from before she was born," he points out, adding that the biopic will also feature Sania's exploits at the Olympics, BWF World Championships and the BWF World Junior Championships.
 
 Interestingly, Amole's actor-son Partho Gupte, who has featured in some of his last directorial's, may compose a song for the film. "He is a huge fan, Saina gave him her India blazer which he has kept in his closet," Amole reveals.
 
 He wants to start filming in a couple of months and will begin casting soon. He has a wish-list that he won't reveal just yet. "It's a challenging role. The actress will have to spend time learning the sport and getting the look right. My close friend and badminton player   will be a consultant on the film," Amole signs off.
