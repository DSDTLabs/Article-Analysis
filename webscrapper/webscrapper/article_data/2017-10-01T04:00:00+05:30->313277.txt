Surat:  ,  ,   

 Police booked and later arrested Setu Dave, his wife Mitali and brother-in-law Jigar Desai for allegedly attacking Alpa Patel. The accused not only thrashed the victim, but also abused her in public. The entire incident was captured on a CCTV camera installed in a nearby shop. 
 
 Setu is son of Bharat Dave, vice-president of Surat district BJP, while Jigar’s mother is a BJP councillor in Bardoli municipality. 
 
 Patel, who was on duty at Limda Chowk in Bardoli, asked a car owner to move his vehicle parked on road at around 10.15 am. The accused came in another car and started an argument with Patel. They then got down from their car and attacked Patel. 
 
 They all went to Bardoli police station where Setu continued to abuse the woman and ask police officers to take action against her. The woman cop was pressurized by some cops at Bardoli police station to reach a compromise, but then district superintendent of police Nirlipt Rai came to know about the incident. Rai ordered police officers to register a complaint against the accused.
 
 “It was a shocking incident wherein a woman traffic brigade employee was thrashed in public. We have also booked the woman for attacking the accused. Strict action will be taken against the accused,” Rai said.
