BHOPAL: More than 100 women sat on a daylong dharna, protesting against a liquor shop in Chhatarpur district on Tuesday.

 The protesters said the shop that was shifted from a highway to their locality will lead to rise in crime against women. Carrying placards with anti-liquor slogans, residents of Narayanpura, a locality of middle class and lower middle class families in Chhatarpur, assembled outside the newly shifted liquor shop. 
 
 Koushalya Sharma, a housewife said, “This shop is going to create nuisance every day. The administration should understand the social problems related to the liquor shop. It will become a hub of anti-social elements.” Salma Khan, another housewife said, “People come and drink here, restricting our movement. The shop should be shifted from here immediately.”The shop was earlier situated near bus stand on the highway that passes through the town. 
 
 Similar agitations have also been taking place in the adjoining districts of Chhatarpur. Excise commissioner   said there were about 180 shops in Madhya Pradesh, which were shifted from other highways to some other places, leading to disputes. “Instructions have been issued to the district administrations to resolve the issue on priority basis,” he said
