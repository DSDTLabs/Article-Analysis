AGARTALA: CPI(M) politburo member   on Friday urged the voters not to believe the promises of   and Prime Minister  , claiming that none of their poll promises made ahead of the 2014   election have been implemented. 

 Addressing an election rally at Belonia, outgoing general secretary of CPI(M) alleged that the   has demonstrated BJP's commitment to serving the interests of big corporate houses at the cost of the common people and working class population of the country.
 
 "It was clear from the Budget that the BJP do not want to mobilize revenues by increasing direct taxes for the rich, in spite of the fact that the top 1% of the Indian population have amassed 73% of the additional wealth generated in 2017," Karat claimed. The governmental expenditures increasingly rely on indirect taxes which are a burden on the common people, Karat said, adding that among the gross central taxes, the proportion of the direct taxes has been budgeted to come down from 51.6% to 50.6%.
 
 "This Budget is a typical example of packaging of propaganda by the Modi government to hoodwink the people. It proposes contracting expenditures and disinvesting the public sector to reduce the fiscal deficit which will appease international finance by imposing greater burdens on the Indian people," Karat alleged, adding that "anti-people policies" of the BJP will lead to its defeat in the upcoming assembly polls in the state. "By defeating BJP in the election, the people of Tripura will take a major step against the anti-people policies of the BJP-led central government," he claimed, again attacking the BJP for its alliance with IPFT(NC).
