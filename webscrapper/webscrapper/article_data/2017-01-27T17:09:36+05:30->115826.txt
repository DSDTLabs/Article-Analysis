Actor-producer   and Sandra Thomas's camaraderie has been such that the duo has paved way for some path breaker films such as Philips and the Monkey pen, Aadu, Zachariayude Garbhinikal and many others. However, looks like it is the end of the road for their relationship. Following a recent tiff,   has filed a complaint against Vijay for allegedly assaulting her at the production house's office at Elamakkara, Kochi. 

  Vijay posted his stand on his social networking page recently saying, 'Friends, a fake case is filed against me by my most trusted partner and her husband for the sake for taking over business property which I disputed. I shall prove it otherwise and will be fine. Thank you for the concerns. Shall update (sic).'
 
  Sandra hasn't responded to the allegations yet.
