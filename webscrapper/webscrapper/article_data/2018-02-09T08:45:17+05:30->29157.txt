He was subsequently rushed to NIMS in Hyderabad where he was diagnosed as suffering from DMD. The ailment apparently runs in the faimly. "My two brothers-in-law died due to this disorder when they were young. My son's only wish now is to meet the chief minister," the boy's father told TOI. 
 
 Telangana assembly speaker S   had recently visited his house and promised that he will fix an appointment with the CM for Vignesh at   very soon.
