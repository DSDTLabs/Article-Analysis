Master blaster Sachin Tendulkar and composer A R Rahman will launch the Sachin Anthem for the cricketer’s biographical drama, 'Sachin: A Billion Dreams', tomorrow. The film traces the legendary player’s journey in cricket in the course of which he ruled the pitch for 24 years. After a heartwarming response to the trailer, the makers are gearing up to bring out the anthem that encapsulates the flavour of the cricketer’s fan-following. The high-decibel ‘Sachin Sachin’ chants throughout the stadium were customary whenever Sachin was at the crease, which the anthem attempts to bring out.
