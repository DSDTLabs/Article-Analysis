KOLKATA: The state government on Tuesday passed a Bill to bar livestock owners from letting loose their cattle on street — or public place — in New Town, where cows often stray onto the six-lane main road and cause accidents. The stray cattle would be auctioned, if not claimed by their owners by paying a fine to the   (NKDA).

 As per the   Kolkata Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2018, if any cattle, horse, pig, dog or any other animal or bird is kept on any land or premises in contravention of the provisions or is found straying, the chairman may direct any officer or employee of the NKDA authority to seize them.
 
 Bidhannagar mayor Sabyasachi Dutta didn’t mince words while approving the bill on Tuesday. “The cows often found on New Town roads are not from the locality but adjacent panchayat areas. Unless there is a provision to penalise them or restrict their entry, the implementation of the Bill may not be fruitful,” said Dutta.
 
 On the day the Bill was passed, TOI drove through the 10.5km New Town Major Arterial Road on Tuesday and found motorists dodging cows, buffaloes and goats straying on to the busy thoroughfare. Not a single owner of the cattle was found accompanying them. It was on this road a motorcyclist, his six-year-old daughter and a colleague had died in a crash while swerving past a herd of cattle at the Akanksha crossing in October last year.
 
 “The Bill has just been passed and it would require the governor’s assent and gazette notification specifying the date on which the law would take effect and then on we will initiate nabbing them,” said a senior official of NKDA.
 
 NKDA will also deploy people who will be trained to handle and catch cattle. The animals would then be brought to a newly built cattle shed at Action Area 1D. The shed can accommodate around 20 animals at a time.
