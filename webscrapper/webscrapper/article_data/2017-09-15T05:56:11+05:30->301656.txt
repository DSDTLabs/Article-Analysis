MUMBAI: In a relief for Shiv Sena leader and minister of   for housing Ravindra Waikar, Lokayukta Justice M L Tahaliyani on Thursday rejected an application filed by city Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam. 

 Nirupam had alleged that Waikar was involved in illegal construction and land grabbing. “We are disappointed over the Lokayukta order, which appears to be on technical reasons. Once we receive an official copy of the verdict, we will move the high court against Lokayukta order,’’ Nirupam said. In a complaint to the Lokayukta submitted on June 28, 2016, Nirupam had alleged that that Waikar had illegally taken possession of 20 acres government land in Aarey Colony and illegally constructed additional floors in a gymnasium run by a trust controlled by his family members. The Lokayukta rejected Nirupam’s contention on grounds that Waikar had returned the illegal and disputed construction to the Slum Improvement Board under the control of Mhada and the illegal construction was made when Waikar was a legislator, which does not come within the Lokayukta’s purview. “While Waikar has returned the gymnasium to the board, but while he was a minister and the chairman of the trust, which was controlling the gymnasium and it was being utilized on a commercial basis,” said Nirupam. 
 
 Waikar has described the allegations against him as baseless and politically motivated.
