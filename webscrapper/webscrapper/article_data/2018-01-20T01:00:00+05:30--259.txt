MUNGER: A brawl between two undertrials over use of tap water led to a clash among two groups of prisoners in Munger district   on Thursday, resulting in serious injuries to one of the inmates.

 An undertrial prisoner Shashi Yadav was rushed to sadar hospital with serious injuries which he suffered in a brawl with another undertrial prisoner Pawan Madal and his group in the jail, said police.
 
 Jailer Nirmal Kumar Prabhat said, “The inmates clashed over use of tap water. When Shashi Yadav had gone for a bath on the tap, Pawan Mandal objected and asked Yadav to leave the place. However, Shashi insisted on taking water from the submersible pump. On this, Pawan lost his cool and brutally assaulted Shashi.”
 
 Following a scuffle between the duo, there was an uproar among the prisoners and soon supporting groups of both the inmates clashed among themselves. As the jail administration failed to tackle them, fresh police reinforcement was requisitioned to control the situation, sources said.
 
 District magistrate Uday Kumar Singh rushed there and inquired into the matter. He later directed the jailer to lodge an FIR against both Pawan and Shashi.
 
 Kotwali police station SHO Shreeram Choudhary said an FIR has been lodged against Pawan Mandal and Sashi Yadava on the basis of a written complaint filed by the jailer, Nirmal Kumar Prabhat, under various sections of the IPC. "Pawan has been locked in a cell after the clash on the direction of the DM for safety of other prisoners lodged inside the jail," said the jailer.
