SHIMLA: Already in grip of biting cold wave, Shimla is likely to get more snowfall and heavy rain in the next few days. The weather department on Sunday issued a warning for heavy to very heavy rain or snow on January 24 and 25.

 Inclement weather has already derailed normal life in most parts of the hill state. Heavy snowfall in higher reaches of the state has led to road blocks, snapping of transmission lines and even water supply.
 
  director Dr   said an active western disturbance is likely to affect western Himalayan region from Monday and plains of northwest India from Tuesday onwards. 
 
 He said an induced upper air cyclonic circulation is most likely to develop over central Pakistan and adjoining west Rajasthan on Monday. Under the combined influence of these systems, fairly widespread rain and snowfall activity is most likely to occur over Himachal Pradesh from January 24 to 27.
