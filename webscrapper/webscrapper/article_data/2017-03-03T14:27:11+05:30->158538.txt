This year at Paris Fashion Week, H&M presented the SS17 collection with a twist. The collection featured womenswear and menswear for the first time. They showcased the first see now, buy now concept over Paris Fashion Week. 

 
 
 
 They also had an interactive pop-up shop at PFW, while the customers around the world could shop the collection online at the same time. Bonus: this collection is now available in India* too.
 
 “Bringing fashion immediately from catwalk to checkout marks a new era for the fashion industry and we value the direct communication we can have with customers through a ‘see now, buy now’ collection. Anything that brings us closer to our customers and makes fashion even more accessible is very positive,” Pernilla Wohlfahrt, H&M’s Head of Design and Creative Director said in a statement.
 
 The starry front row saw  , Alexa Chung with a surprise performance by The Weeknd. And, the collection was a balance between tailoring and sportwear—with fine knits, relaxed-fit trousers, athletic anoraks. While, mixing ruffles with athleisure was a perfect clash of trends.
