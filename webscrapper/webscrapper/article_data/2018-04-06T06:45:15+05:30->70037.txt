NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday kept interest rates unchanged, while retaining its "neutral stance". The central bank lowered its estimate for retail inflation and sounded upbeat about growth prospects, saying there are "clear signs of revival in investment activity."

 This is the fourth consecutive monetary policy meeting in which rates have been kept unchanged. While the government has been backing a rate cut, citing benign price pressures, the RBI has preferred to wait and watch. The policy rate remained unchanged at 6%. Five members of the   ( ), including governor  , voted in favour of rates being unchanged, while one member voted for an increase.
 
 The MPC said GDP growth is projected to strengthen from 6.6% in 2017-18 to 7.4% in 2018-19 - in the range of 7.3-7.4% in the first half and 7.3-7.6% in the second half. The MPC noted that growth has been recovering and the output gap is closing. "This is also reflected in a pickup in credit offtake in recent months. The large mobilisation of resources from the primary capital market should support investment activity further."
 
 It also said the string of reforms unveiled by the government should help the cyclical recovery that is under way and reinforce the long-term growth potential. The RBI cited a number of downside risks to growth, including any deterioration in public finances, which could risk crowding out private financing and investment. "Furthermore, even as global growth and trade have been strengthening, rising trade protectionism and financial market volatility could derail the ongoing global recovery," the MPC said.
