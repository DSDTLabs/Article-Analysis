PATNA: Within hours of her kidnapping from   at Gulab Bagh market in   town, police rescued seven-year-old   Vinakiya, daughter of businessman Surendra Vinakiya, from West Bengal near the district border on late Monday evening. 

 “We   the girl within seven hours. Four Purnia locals have also been arrested,” Purnia range DIG Saurav Kumar said, adding the motive behind kidnapping was yet to be ascertained.
 
 Purnia superintendent of police (SP) Vishal Sharma said an FIR was lodged with Purnia Sadar police station. Surendra owns a wholesale general store in the town. 
 
 Sources close to the family said the school bus dropped Navya off around 100m from her house at around 2pm. But before she could enter the lane leading to her house, a white car without any number plate stopped and dragged the girl inside and sped away.
 
 “CCTV footage revealed how she was dragged into the car. Onlookers said there were four persons in the car. The person who dragged Navya into the car was wearing a golden ring in his one ear. No ransom was demanded,” a close friend of Navya’s family told this newspaper over the phone.
 
 When asked about the kidnappers, DIG Saurav said: “A special investigation team (SIT) was formed under Purnia SP and the police followed all the leads available about the incident.” 
 
 Sharma said he was in touch with all the neighbouring district SPs. “We were closely working with Katihar, Naugachia and Supaul police. We knew about the make and model of the car,” Sharma said.
