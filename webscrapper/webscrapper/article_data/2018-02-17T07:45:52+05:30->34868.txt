LUDHIANA : Five months after registering an FIR against seven men for allegedly gang-raping the wife of their drug addict friend, the police have decided to cancel the case. 

  SHO   said, "A month ago, while recording her statement before the court, the woman had said that she wanted to withdraw the complaint. As she does not want to pursue the case, we have decided to cancel it." 
 
 Besides the complainant's husband, the police had booked the seven on September 13 last. The FIR stated that the complainant's husband had offered her to his friends to fund his addiction. 
 
 The woman's grandfather said, "After the panchayat decided that we should withdraw the case, my granddaughter took a divorce from her husband. We cannot pursue it as both my sons, including my granddaughter's father, have passed away. 
 
 "After the incident, I too suffered two heart attacks. My health is failing me now."
