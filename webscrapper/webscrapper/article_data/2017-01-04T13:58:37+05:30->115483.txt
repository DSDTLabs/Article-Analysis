PATNA: Unidentified criminals shot at Mufassil police station SHO Ashish Kumar Singh (31) during a raid conducted at   in Khagaria district around Monday midnight.

 Khagaria SDPO Ramanand Sagar said Singh, a 2009 batch sub-inspector, was tipped off about a kidnapping and murder case accused Sujay Kumar’s presence at Bhadas. Sujay managed to escape. “As soon as the police team reached near Sujay’s house in the village, he and his associates opened fire. One of the bullets hit the SHO in his left leg,” the SDPO said.
 
 He said around six rounds of fire were exchanged between the police and the criminals. Singh was rushed to Khagaria sadar hospital where doctors declared him out of danger.
 
 Khagaria SP Anil Kumar Singh said the SHO was discharged from hospital Tuesday morning after a surgery to take out the pellet from his leg which had hit him just below the knee. “Identity of the criminals who attacked the officer has been ascertained. Three suspects have been detained for interrogation,” said the SP, adding that the accused whom SHO had gone to arrest, was evading arrest from a long time. He was wanted in a kidnapping and murder case.
