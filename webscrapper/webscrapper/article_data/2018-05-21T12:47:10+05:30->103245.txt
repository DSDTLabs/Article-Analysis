PANAJI: The Goa’s   (RDA) has engaged women from Kerala’s Kudumbshree initiative to help the women’s self-help groups in Goa to learn the ropes of business. Already around 700 women from Goa’s self-help groups have been trained as a first step.

 The   government, under its Kudumbshree initiative, targeted women as a means to eradicate poverty. Today, under this initiative, numerous women across Kerala are running successful businesses including poultries and community farming ventures. Some have even been employed by the government for effective management of parking lots.
 
 “Two members from the Kudumshree initiative had come to Goa as field coordinators and taught the women of Goa’s self-help groups how to run their groups in a professional manner,” said RDA assistant project officer Bhaskar Narulkar.
 
 In the next phase, around 700 women from self-help groups from across Goa were chosen, panchayat-wise. “They were sent to Maharashtra and Kerala, where they spent 10 days each with women of self-help groups, seeing how they function and the successful business models they run that can be replicated in Goa. The women were paid a honorarium for the duration of their stay there,” said Narulkar.
 
 These women will now serve as community and block resource persons to train other women in business skills.
 
 Next , the RDA will target the areas of Pernem, Bicholim, Bardez, Quepem,   and Canacona.
