INDORE: Thanks to  ,   at Super Corridor has been turned into a  .

 Another problem that   about is jaywalking as residents of nearby areas do not wait for vehicles while crossing the intersection — a hazard to both the  .
 
 Several accidents have been reported near this intersection and the number of fatalities is high. One of the major accidents at this spot, which took place last year, saw the deaths of five members of a family.
 
 The intersection is one of three major accident prone spots on the 8 km corridor.
 
 Though authorities have highlighted design flaws, problems with lighting and encroachment as major problems that have made the stretch such a death trap, no measures to ease traffic have been started so far.
 
 “At times it becomes too risky for us to take the main lane as vehicles, even heavy ones, drive at full speed,” said Rohit Bhandari, a working professional, who regularly passes the area. There are also no cops to regulate traffic here, he added.
 
 Traffic experts claim that the stretch witnesses around four to five accidents daily. Measures to control cars from overspeeding should be set in place.
 
 “The speed limit on the stretch is not defined so motorists feel free to drive at whatever speed they please,” said Prafulla Joshi, traffic expert.
 
 There is also the problem of visibility here. Motorists coming on the corridor cannot see other vehicles coming from connecting roads, leading to accidents. People coming from nearby areas who want to take the super corridor have to guess the speed of vehicles coming from both directions and then get onto the road. This becomes an inconvenience to vehicles, especially heavy ones, said Joshi.
 
 Installing blinkers or setting up zigzag barricades is the only solution to control increasing accidents at this junction, he suggested.
