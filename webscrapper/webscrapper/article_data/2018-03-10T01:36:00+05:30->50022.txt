  Passenger services from Majlis Park and Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus stations would begin at 6pm, he added.
 
 The section, which has 12 stations, was inspected by the commissioner for Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) between February 26 and 28, and has received the safety go-ahead on Thursday.
 
  The corridor, one of the longest in the metro network, will function like an arc connecting north, northwest, west and south Delhi. The remaining 58.59km of the corridor would be completed by June this year, except for a 1.5km stretch between Trilokpuri and Mayur Vihar Pocket-1 due to land issues at Trilokpuri.

 The section would have three interchange stations — Azadpur, Netaji Subhash Place and Rajouri Garden, apart from being connected with the Dhaula Kuan station of Airport Express Line through a walkway, which would be completed by June. 
 
 The Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus and Dhaula Kuan stations are at a distance of 1km and would be connected through a walkway with travelators.
