NEW DELHI: A number of   in the city will soon get a refreshing look, with   Municipal Corporation planning to install several vertical gardens over the next four months. These, officials said, would not only beautify these locations, but also help combat dust pollution. The corporation has zeroed in on 11 major flyovers for the first phase of the project for which recycled water will be used. In the second phase, structures, such as garbage collection centres and other buildings, will be covered.

 
  
 
 “Flyovers at Lajpat Nagar, Andrews Ganj,  ,  , Nehru Place and Raja Garden will soon have vertical gardens,” Alok Kumar, director of SDMC’s horticulture department, said. The corporation is planning to use two types of holding structures — plastic pots hung over plastic frames and coco-pit-based medium for plants with a bigger root system.
 
 The civic body will use a variety of ferns, ficus species, ribbon grass and blade grass to provide a modern look to the gardens. “The project has already been initiated at Savitri flyover. These plants will replace dead concrete walls with lively green spaces, which are known to relieve tension. They will trap excess dust and release oxygen,” Kumar said. 
 
 Commsioner Puneet Goel said: “This is one of the projects to tackle the spike in pollution.” One of the biggest contributors to Delhi’s air pollution is road dust. It accounts for 35% of PM2.5 emissions, a study by IIT Kanpur recently revealed. According to a report by the Union environment ministry, over 131 tonnes of dust is generated each day in Delhi.
 
 Director of horticulture in the north civic body, Ranbir Singh, said his department would soon start a pilot project at the upcoming Rani Jhansi flyover.
