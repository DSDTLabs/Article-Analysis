NEW DELHI: Bhuvneshwar Kumar is a wily old customer, especially when it comes to bowling at the death in this format.

 
 
 
 
 On Thursday, however, the   seamer had no answer to the power, and more importantly, the intelligence, with which   batsman   dealt with him.
 
 The southpaw used the crease wonderfully well, especially in handling the last two overs off Bhuvneshwar — the 18th and 20th of the innings, in which the seamer leaked an astonishing 44 runs.
 
 Pant picked on the fact that Bhuvneshwar was trying to hit wide yorkers outside his off-stump. First, Pant bought out the flickcum-pick-up shot over short third man to tackle with those away-going deliveries.
 
 The Delhi wicketkeeper sat deep in his crease and waited for the ball to go across him.
 
 In the final over, he slotted two more of such balls away for four — both a foot inside the popping crease — as the Kotla crowd went delirious.
 
 Bhuvneshwar reacted as he always has, by changing his length, but Pant pulled him over fine leg for a massive six.
 
 On the last few balls of the final over, Pant took guard outside the crease when Sunrisers skipper Kane Williamson pushed his third man back. Stepping out to Bhuvi, Pant easily hit the next two balls for six – over long off and deep midwicket. This was not only ‘mind games’ but ‘crease games’ on display from the pugnacious Pant!
 
 
 
 
 Harshal Patel, the 27-year-old medium pacer from Sanand in Gujarat, shifted base to Haryana after failing to make the Gujarat Ranji side. He made immediate impact in his debut Ranji season in 2011-12 with 28 wickets earned him a ticket to the   with RCB.
 
 With his bowling apparently trailing off, Harshal, it seems has now shifted focus to his batting. The DD think-tank decided to mix things up by sending Harshal ahead of Glenn Maxwell and Vijay Shanker, which worked like a charm for the home side.
