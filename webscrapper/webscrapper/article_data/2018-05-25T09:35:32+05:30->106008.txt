DEHRADUN: After much delay, the Dehradun Municipal Corporation’s plan to outsource the door-to-door garbage collection is set to fructify soon as the tender has finally been awarded and the company will start work from next month.
 
  “We have awarded the tender to a company named   and we are in the process of signing the contract. Once the contract is signed, the company will start collecting garbage within a month,” said municipal commissioner Vijay Kumar Jogdande.
  
  According to Jogdande, once the new model is implemented, it will double the corporation’s revenues. “At present, DMC earns around Rs 10-12 lakh through house-to-house garbage collection. This is expected to go up to almost around Rs 25 lakh,” he said.
  
  The move is also expected to stabilize the garbage collection mechanism which on most days remains erratic. Residents complain that DMC workers visit hardly once a week and most of the days they have to either throw the waste themselves or hire private workers. “At present the garbage collection is not consistent. In fact, in areas such as  , collection is done once a week and when we complain, they say that their vehicle broke down, but if the work is outsourced through a private company it will fix the accountability,” said RWA president Mahesh Bhandari.
