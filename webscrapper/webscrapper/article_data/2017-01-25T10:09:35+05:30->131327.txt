MADURAI: The much-awaited Alanganallur  , which is one of the main tourist attractions in Madurai, will be out of bounds for foreigners when it is held on February 1as the organisers see them as a potential threat to the game.

 Every year, the tourism department brings in a group of foreign tourists to witness jallikattu along with the VVIPs.But, this year it will be a strict no to foreigners who they generally perceive to be supporters of   (PeTA) which opposes jallikattu.
 
 Village committee head   said that the tourists might be harmless, but they had decided to respect the local sentiments and ask the tourism department not to bring foreigners this year. “In fact, we have been informed that we should not pose with any foreigner who comes to this village,'' said  , a resident.
 
 The villagers are planning to formally invite the chief minister in a day or two. “We are hardpressed for time as we plan to make it a memorable event with lakhs attending it,'' said Sundarajan. The village council estimates not less than 500 bulls and an equal number of bull tamers will participate in the event this year. The villagers say they are grateful to the students who had made jallikattu a reality.
 
 Many companies have come forward to sponsor the prizes comprising gold coins, LCD televisions, refrigerators, washing machines and even motorcycles.
 
 The women say that the men in their homes have promised them a hoard of gifts as 500 bulls would bring in double the number of prizes.
 
 Meanwhile, in Madurai city, 11 people were arrested for damaging buses and seven more persons are being searched. Madurai rural police arrested 120 persons in connection with protests and all of them have been released.
