SALIGAO: A large number of   residents assembled at the village’s panchayat hall, on Friday, to put forth their grievances about the constant power fluctuations being witnessed in the constituency.

 The meeting was convened by minister for housing Jayesh Salgaonkar. Present were Saligao sarpanch Lafira Remedious Gomes along with other panch members, and electricity department officials.
 
 Salgaonkar told residents that the frequent load shedding was due to extra units being consumed by some households in the village. “There is constant load shedding every 20 minutes because many houses are using air conditioners, which hampers proper electricity supply to the village,” he said.
 
 The housing minister told villagers that he would try his best to find a solution to the problem. “We will speak to the power minister   about the problem and will demand that a sub-station be set up in Saligao,” he said, adding that this would solve the village’s power problem.
 
 The minister said the finance department had agreed to sanction a large sum towards setting up of infrastructure in Saligao to ensure uninterrupted power supply. “Within a year there will be no complaints from villagers with regards to fluctuations,” Salgaonkar said
 
 Villagers questioned electricity department engineers as to why power was being supplied to Calangute from Saligao and demanded that this be stopped. “Why have the villagers of Saligao been made to face the brunt of less power supply?” they asked. 
 
 Electricity department officials told the residents that a proposal to set up a substation at Calangute has been put up.
