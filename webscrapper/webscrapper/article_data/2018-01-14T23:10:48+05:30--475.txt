Panaji: Aerospace and Defence manufacturer, Kineco Kaman Composites India Pvt Ltd plans to invest Rs 18 crore to expand the firm’s manufacturing facility at Pilerne industrial estate. Announcing the move, chairman and managing director Shekhar Sardesai said that the expansion would double the manufacturing capacity of Kineco Kaman. “We laid the foundation stone for expansion of our facility at Pilerne industrial estate, which will need an investment of $2 million,” Sardesai. “Thanks to this expansion, we will more than double our capacity. We are also going to more than double our staff strength in the next 5 years.” The joint venture between the Goan firm Kineco Pvt Ltd and USA company Kaman Aerospace Group, Inc completes five successful years. Goa Investment Promotion Board approved the expansion of the manufacturing facility at Pilerne. The expanded facilities are expected to be operational by the third quarter of 2018 and will more than double the production capacity and create employment opportunities for around 100 people, said company officials. “While we have come a long way in achieving success over the last five years, I believe that we have only scratched the surface given the potential that exists in the Indian aerospace industry,” said Sardesai. “I strongly believe that Kineco Kaman with an early mover advantage has built a strong foundation which will go a long way in supporting its growth ambitions and in the process contribute to the economic and employment goals of Goa and India,” said chairman, president and chief executive officer of Kaman Corporation, Neal Keating.
