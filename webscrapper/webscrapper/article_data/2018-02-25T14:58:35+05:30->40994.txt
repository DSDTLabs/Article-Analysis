PILIBHIT: A class VIII student at a convent school here sustained severe injuries in his right ear after being thrashed by his IT teacher. The boy was sent to a hospital by the school after the incident. An   was lodged in the matter on Friday evening against the teacher, Swati Yadav, based on a complaint of the boy’s mother.
 
  The mother of the victim, Nikhil Chaudhary, said he had suffered partial hearing loss after being repeatedly slapped by his teacher, which caused excessive bleeding, at around 1 pm on Friday. “The teacher first rebuked him and then beat him up without any reason. After he told me about it, I lodged an FIR against her,” said Sangita Chaudhary, the mother. The school hadn’t informed the child's parents about the matter.
  
  The ENT surgeon who treated the boy, Dr SK Mitra, said there was a chance the latter could permanently lose hearing in his right ear. “The boy had injuries in his external early canal and perforation in the internal membrane (the ear drum).”
  
  On being asked about the incident, Nikhil said he was taking the refill of a pen when his teacher snatched it from him and started beating him. The boy’s father, Davendra Singh Chaudhary, is a zila panchayat member and a coordinator to union minister for women and child development Maneka Gandhi.
  
  SHO of   police station, GS Gwal, said, “An FIR has been lodged against Swati Yadav under section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the IPC. Of these, section 326 can lead to life imprisonment."
  
  Gwal added that the boy had been sent to the district hospital for medical examination on Friday but as there was no ENT there, he was taken to a government hospital in Bareilly on Saturday. Police are waiting for the medical report, which they need to proceed in the case.
  
  The school could not be contacted by TOI.
