CHANDIGARH:   president   has dismissed speculations that Haryana chief minister   could be replaced. Speaking in Chandigarh on Saturday, he said that there was no such move even as 16 BJP legislators and few ministers in the state had been expressing dissatisfaction against his functioning.

 Khattar, a former RSS pracharak, was picked up as the CM after the BJP formed government in Haryana on its own in 2014 for the first time. He was chosen as the CM ahead of other aspirants like Anil Vij, Ram Bilas Sharma and Capt Abhimanyu.
 
 On some party MLAs and even workers being unhappy, Shah said that, “I meet all of them, you need not be worried.” When asked about the rising dissent among party leaders in the state, the BJP chief countered a reporter and asked him to name the ‘dissident’ MLAs. He praised the Khattar government, especially for its performance in improving the skewed sex ratio in the state. 
 
 In July, Shah will be undertaking a three-day Haryana tour, as part of his nationwide ‘vistar mission’.
