As Disney fans, we always look forward to celebrities channeling the cartoon counterparts. Yesterday, our very own, Bollywood beauty,   stunned us in 3 princess-worthy gowns at Cannes.

 Like every time in the past, this time too she didn’t disappoint her fans from all over the world with her winning fashion moments at Cannes. Aishwarya was spotted in 2 big (can we call it elaborate?) gowns and then the biggest gown for the main red carpet appearance on her very first day at Cannes. 
 
 
 Looking at her gowns, we couldn’t help but compare her with our favourite animated characters like Belle, Cinderella and many more from the Disney gang. 
 
  
 For her first look during the day, she was spotted in a green tiered gown. She wore this tiered gown at the beach, which made her look pretty much like the modern version of Ariel.
 
  
  
 
 But, that’s not it! Part of us also felt that her gown resembled Belle’s green gown and here’s a picture proving the same.
 
  
  
 
 Just as the excitement of Aishwarya’s green gown was going down, she stunned everyone in another princess-esque gown. Her photo of sitting in a huge ball gown mesmerised us yet again! The white gown totally reminded us of the old Cinderella gown and she looked breathtaking in it.
 
 
  
  
  
 Lastly,   stepped out at Cannes' red carpet in a beautiful Cinderella-worthy ball gown by Michael Cinco. The huge ball gown made her look no less than a princess.
  
  
  
 
 Moreover, many felt that the gown also made her look like the latest animation sensation Elsa from Frozen, and we couldn't agree more.
 
 
  
  
 
 Aishwarya, who is no stranger to the annual film festival, is celebrating her 15 years at Cannes. And this year on the first day she has won our hearts again with her dramatic gowns, ethereal style, and mesmerising beauty.
