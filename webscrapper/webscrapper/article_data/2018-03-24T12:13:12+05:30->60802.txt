HYDERABAD: The Supreme Court will conduct a final hearing in the   acquittal case in August this year.

 The apex court was of the opinion that there was a prime facie evidence against the rowdy-sheeter and other accused in the murder of an advocate. A three-judge bench of Justices U Lalit, Goyal and   on Friday heard the matter in a special leave petition (SLP) filed by the state government challenging the   order acquitting Ayub in advocate Mannan Ghori murder case. Telangana through Hyderabad police had filed the SLP in 2017.
 
 DGP M  , who was commissioner of police, Hyderabad, flew to Delhi to appear on behalf of the city police. The court, after hearing the argument of solicitor general, admitted the SLP and issued warrants to the accused. “The Supreme Court is satisfied with the evidence produced against the accused. The final hearing will be in August,” said ACP Asifnagar K Ashoka Chakravarthy.
 
 In 2002, Ayub Khan allegedly murdered advocate Ghori in Taleem Malad area falling under Hussainialam police station limits over forcible collection of mamool. He was arrested along with his associates — Mohammed Habeeb Qureshi alias Habeeb, Khaled Munawar alias Baba and Faiyaz Mohammed Khan alias Rustum Mohammed Khan. Police claimed all of them were rowdy-sheeters in south zone.
 
 Eight years later, in 2010, the metropolitan sessions court convicted all the accused and awarded them life sentence. Ayub Khan filed an appeal in the High Court which in 2014 set aside the conviction handed out by the lower court on technical grounds.
 
 In March 2015, the law department issued a GO (No 205) and accorded permission to the city to file the SLP against the High Court order. Later, in December 2016, the south zone police arrested Ayub at Mumbai International Airport when he was found travelling on a fake passport. The city police have also invoked PD Act against him. He was released from Chanchalguda jail in February this year.
