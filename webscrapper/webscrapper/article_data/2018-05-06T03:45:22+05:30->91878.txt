MUMBAI: To caution people about trees on private properties that lean dangerously on to footpaths or roads, the   has decided to place a warning board asking people not to stand near these. The boards shall be removed only after the trees are trimmed or cut upon obtaining permission for it. 

 The BMC says that there are 29.75 lakh trees in the city, of which 15.63 lakh are on private premises.
 
 There have been many instances where trees on private properties have fallen on pedestrians, killing them and triggering a dispute between the BMC and the property owners. In most cases, the BMC claimed it had issued a notice to the society asking it to trim the trees but the society claimed it had not received permission from the BMC for it. 
 
 Last month, a 38-year-old pedestrian, Dinesh Sangale, died after a tree crashed on him outside Mumbai Marathi  . The property owner and the BMC kept trading charges.
 
 An activist said that while it was good that a board would make people aware about such trees, the BMC was trying to get rid of its responsibility. 
 
 "Although it's a good idea, under the Tree Act the BMC has powers to inspect trees inside private premises and issue a notice to societies asking them to trim the dangerous trees," activist Zoru Bhathena said. "In case societies fail to do so, the BMC can impose a penalty and prosecute them."
 
 BMC officials said they took he issue seriously and it was discussed with municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta on Saturday. Mehta told them to examine all dangerous trees.
