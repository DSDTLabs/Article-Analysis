VADODARA: At a time when   and the opposition are in a war of words over selling ‘pakodas’, members of the   ( ) staged a protest near Vadodara railway station by frying ‘pakodas’ and distributing the snack to the public to protest against “rising unemployment”.

 The NSUI protesters said that at a time when youths are struggling to get employment, Prime Minister   and BJP national president   are making a joke out of their misery by saying that selling of ‘pakodas’ are jobs. 
 
 The PM recently replying to a question of employment generation in the country had said that even a person who sells pakodas is employed as he is earning Rs 200 per day.
 
 “Even a father who selling ‘pakodas’ works hard to support his son or daughter’s education so that his wards earn a degree from a reputed university and bag a job. But our PM is telling us to sell pakodas. What is the use of degrees like MBBS, MBA or any other degree from any university if the PM thinks that selling pakodas is a job,” said NSUI Vadodara unit president  . 
 
 The group had hired a stall near   for nearly an hour to stage the protest programme. “This is a bad joke on the hard working youths of this country,” said Thakor, who was joined by group of other NSUI leaders.
