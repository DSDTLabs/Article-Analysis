After the appreciation that ' ' received, actor-producer   and actor Vinay Pathak are all set to team up for a whole new adventure. 

 Currently untitled, this film will be Bheegi Basanti Entertainment’s second project after 'Chalo Dilli'. To be helmed by National Award-winning director  , the film revolves around an NRI single mother’s emotional journey through the heartland of India in search of the anonymous donor who fathered her son. Sushil has been the cinematographer on films like 'Laaga Chunari Mein Daag' and won the National Award in 2009 for the film he directed, ' '.
 
 Says Lara, “We at   had been on the lookout for another story that had the same humour and emotional connect that 'Chalo Dilli' had and have finally found that with a script that Sushil has brought us. It is liberating and refreshing to pursue great stories and bring them alive on celluloid through challenging and lovable characters and most importantly, to make people laugh and cry at the same time. Vinay is a fabulous actor and co-star and I find it invigorating and thoroughly enjoyable to share the screen with him.” 
 
 While Vinay and Sushil have collaborated before, Lara will be joining them for the first time. The film is slated to go on floors by June.
