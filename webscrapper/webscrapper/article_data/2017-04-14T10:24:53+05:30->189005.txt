MUMBAI: If you are planning a trip to Mahabaleshwar to beat the   heat, look for another reason to visit the popular hill station.

 For, over the past four to five days, maximum temperatures at the hill station have consistently been higher than those recorded by the   (IMD) at its Colaba and Santacruz observatories in Mumbai.
 
 Considering that it is a hill station, Mahabaleshwar is known to be cooler than the coastal Mumbai during summer. 
 
 However, weathermen have observed a reverse trend this season. 
 
 Maximum   recorded at Mahableshwar on April 13, for instance, was 35.9 degree Celsius compared with 34.8 degrees by IMD Santacruz. A day earlier, on April 12, too, Mahableshwar was almost as hot at 35.2 degrees while IMD Santacruz recorded 34.1 degrees. The April 12 temperature at Mahabaleshwar was three degrees above normal and that at Santacruz 1.5 degrees.
 
 “This is definitely not good news,” say weathermen. 
 
 “The anticyclone over Saurashtra in Gujarat is carrying north-easterly warm and moisture-less winds to this place, causing Mahabaleshwar to get hotter. Also, the easterly wave is merging with north-easterly winds in the area. However, as the position of the anticyclone has been inching down latitude-wise, the direction of north-easterly winds is likely to change, which is likely to result in lowering of temperatures at the hill station in the coming week,” said K S Hosalikar, deputy general, western region, IMD.
 
 Meanwhile, maximum temperature in Mumbai continued to hover around 35 degrees on Thursday. 
 
 Hosalikar cited a severe heat wave in parts of Saurashtra and Kutch in Gujarat and the winds blowing into the city from these regions for the rise in the heat and the discomfort index.
 
 “The winds are also dying out in the evenings and there is high moisture content, which is causing the discomfort index to rise,” said Hosalikar and added that Mumbaikars must brace for a two-degree rise in temperature in the coming days.
