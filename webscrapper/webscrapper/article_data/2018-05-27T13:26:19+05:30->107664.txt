THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: It is one rare project with more than half of the total project cost reserved for road safety. Of the total project cost of Rs 146 crore of the Kazhakkoottam — Adoor model safe corridor under KSTP, around Rs 86 crore was reserved for road safety measures such as junction design and road markings.

 
 Though the World Bankfunded project was awarded to the Kerala state transport project (KSTP) more than one and a half years ago, it handed over the works to design road safety component of the project to National Transportation Planning and Research Centre ( ) just a month ago.
 
 Lack of proper road safety measures, including road markings, means the stretch would turn to be an ‘unsafe corridor’.
 
 Sources said that as per the agreement, the project, which was awarded in December 2016, had to be completed by last month. However, due to lack of designs, which include design of junctions and road safety components, amajor share of work is yet to be completed.
 
 Sources said that Natpac was given responsibility to design the road safety component only last month. Natpac has been given only five months to finish the designs, which is an integral component of the model safety corridor.
 
 Initially, responsibility for design of road safety component of the project was planned to be given to  , a global expert in road safety. However, the Vicroads was terminated some months ago over issues in project execution under KSTP and thus the responsibility fell on Natpac. Like other projects under KSTP, which faced issues over faulty DPR, model corridor too is heading for a major trouble.
 
 Miffed by the delay in works and increasing cases of accidents due to lack of road markings, Kollam rural SP B Ashokan had recently sent a letter to KSTP chief engineer asking to speed up the works. Police had alleged that 10 people lost their lives in fatal accidents occurred between   to   in two months.
