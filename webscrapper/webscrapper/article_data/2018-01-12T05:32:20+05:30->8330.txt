DHARAMSHALA: Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader Mukesh   raised the issue of RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) intervening into the functioning of government. “The involvement of RSS has increased in the government. I respectfully want to bring it in the knowledge of the chief minister that various power centers are also there around you,” the   leader said during discussion on the motion of thanks on the governor’s address on Thursday.

 Dwelling on the promises made by BJP’s CM designate Prem Kumar Dhumal, Agnihotri said, “Though the face (of CM as projected by  ) has changed, the promises made to the people should not be changed. The vision document doesn’t have a single announcement made by   before elections.” Dhumal had promised to abolish barrier tax, end Rashtriya Uchchattar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) and make contractual employees permanent, but the government’s vision document does not includes anyone of this, he said.
 
 Agnihotri also raised the issue of Raghunath temple, questioning the BJP government’s move to reverse its predecessor’s decision of taking over temple. “Governmen. has withdrawn the move to take over Raghunath temple while the   high court has already given a decision on theissue and the case is now in the  ,” he said.
