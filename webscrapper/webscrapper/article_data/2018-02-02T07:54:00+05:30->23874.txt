Within minutes, I received a call from the assailants that they had waylaid Telu nearby and would teach him a lesson. When I went out, I saw Sondhi, his two sons (Himanshu and Ankush), his brother Dharminder and some others around Telu and shouting at him. When I tried to intervene, Sondhi drew a pistol and fired at Telu’s abdomen,” it has been alleged in the complaint. The firing took place past midnight.
 
 The BJP leader is being treated at a private hospital. Police arrested Sondhi and Khosla in the morning, while others were on the run. Both were produced in a local court and the magistrate remanded them in police custody for two days. Police said they were they to recover the weapon used in firing.
