CHENNAI:   (DV&AC) sleuths on Tuesday trapped and arrested a government official for taking   from an 84-year-old widow to get her pension.

 DVAC officials said G Nandakumar, 56, a record clerk in the education department at the state secretariat had already collected Rs 35,000 from Mary Rathi Gunam of Coonoor and was caught while trying to get the remaining Rs 15000.
 
 Mary, who had been trying to get her pension transferred since the death in 2007 of her husband Williams, a government school teacher in Coonoor, was told bribing the officials concerned could help.
 
 The woman then approached Nandakumar who promised to get her job done for Rs 50,000 and, on her request, agreed to accept it in installments. 
 
 “In January 2016, he took Rs 25000 in cash and asked her to transfer Rs 10,000 to his bank account,” said a DVAC official.
 
 He agreed to take the last tranche of Rs 15,000 on Monday night at the Koyambedu bus terminus. Mary informed her son-in-law Manickam who lodged a complaint with DVAC.
 
 Officials then set up a trap for Nandakumar and lay in wait at the Koyambedu terminus. Mary was accompanied by Manickam, who handed over the money to Nandakumar.
 
 As soon as Nandakumar accepted the wad of the money, the waiting DVAC officials pounced on him. Based on Manickam's complaint, Nandakumar was arrested and a court later sent him to Puzhal prison.
