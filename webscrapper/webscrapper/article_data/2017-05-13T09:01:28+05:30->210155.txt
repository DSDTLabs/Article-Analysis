BENGALURU: Three students who wrote the   in March-April achieved the unbelievable, scoring   in the  . 

 Sumanth Hegde from Bengaluru, Poornananda H from Mangaluru and Pallavi Shirahatti from Bagalkot are the three toppers. Last year, only one student, Ranjan BS from Shivamogga, had scored 100% in SSLC. Aspiring to pursue education in the field of mathematics and applied sciences, Sumanth had not expected to secure maximum marks. “I was expecting around 620 but definitely not 625,“ he said.
 
 Barring such streaks of excellence, the SSLC results this year have been gloomy, registering a 7.24% dip in pass percentage over last year: from 75.11% in 2016 to 67.87% this year. Primary and secondary education minister   attributed the drop in pass percentage to the newly established Karnataka Secure Examinations System that not only monitored the conduct of exams but also the evaluation. 
 
 “We had incorporated strict security features. The results, although lower than before, are testimony to the efforts put in by students, without any malpractices. The eradication of grace marks as part of the national policy is another huge factor in the dip in pass percentage,“ said the minister added.
 
 Girls, meanwhile, ruled the roost this year too, recording a pass percentage of 74.08 as compared to boys' 62.42%.
