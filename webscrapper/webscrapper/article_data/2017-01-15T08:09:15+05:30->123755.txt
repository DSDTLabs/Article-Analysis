LUCKNOW : Governor   on Saturday disqualified   MLA   from his membership of the state Assembly for procuring government contracts in his name.

 His disqualification will be with retrospective effect from March 6, 2012 when he had become member of the UP Assembly.
 
 However, the decision of   would hardly affect   as the term of the Assembly, of which he was member, has already expired and he has been fielded from the same Rasra Assembly constituency in Balia as BSP’s official candidate.
 
 A petition was filed in December, 2013 before the then lokayukta, Justice NK Mehrotra, who after finding Singh guilty of procuring construction contracts from the government in his name, had recommended his disqualification from the Assembly. However, Uma Shankar had challenged the decision in the high court, which had asked the governor to seek opinion of the Election Commission. The EC on January 10 pronounced that he should be disqualified and thereafter Governor Ram Naik passed an order in this regard on Saturday.
 
 Uma Shankar’s disqualification is the first such case in UP’s political history, which could discourage the elected representatives from procuring contracts in their own name.
