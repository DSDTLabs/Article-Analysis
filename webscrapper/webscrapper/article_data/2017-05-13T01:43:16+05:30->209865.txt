NEW DELHI: A major fire gutted a private restaurant at the   on Friday night. However, nobody was injured. Preliminary investigations suggest that the fire might have been caused by a short-circuit in the kitchen.

 Around 8pm, employees at the popular restaurant noticed smoke coming out of the desert section of the kitchen and alerted the management. 
 
 The guests sitting in the ground-floor restaurant were immediately asked to vacate the hall. Soon the blaze spread through the wooden facade and some of the employees had to be evacuated through the rear door of the restaurant.
 
 Fire officials said   chairs inside the restaurant led the flames to quickly spread through the seating area. Seven fire tenders were sent to the spot and the blaze was brought under control within half an hour. 
 
 Officials said the area around restaurant was barricaded and the passengers from the railway station were told not to use a nearby staircase to prevent crowding. Goods and properties worth lakhs were damaged. 
 
 The police are checking whether the restaurant authorities had got the required no-objection certificate renewed from the fire department. An FIR for causing   will be registered once the probe is over.
