NEW DELHI:   brushed aside its losses in the bypolls and said on Thursday that these were no reflection of things to come when the country will have to choose its PM, and it will be   again in 2019.

 
 "When elections happen in 2019, when PM will have to be chosen, the people of India know what is the meaning of PM. P is for ‘performance’ and M is for ‘mehnat’ (hard work)... on this measuring scale, Modiji alone will be the country’s PM. BJP, under the leadership of Modiji and Amit Shah’s hard work, will win more seats in 2019 than it did in 2014,” party spokesman   said at a press conference.
 
 Patra said BJP had lost in bypolls in 2014 even after winning the general elections with a huge mandate but in 2017, it won 325 seats in   and formed the government. “It is because bypolls are fought on local issues and it does not chose a CM or a PM,” he said. Patra said while it was a day for introspection for BJP, it was more important for   to do the same instead of throwing barbs at others and clapping at the performance of regional parties.
