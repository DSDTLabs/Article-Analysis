Noida: Two more lanes on   near   in   are slated to open for commuters next month, ensuring a smooth flow of traffic. The Noida Authority had already opened two lanes on the bridge in October last year in order to provide a signal-free corridor.

 Commuters using Master Plan Road–II, also called Maharaja Agrasen Marg, which connects Film City to Sector 60 via Shahdara bridge, are already enjoying a smooth drive. They have relief from repeated traffic gridlocks at the narrow bridge near Film City flyover. Now the work on two more lanes on the other side of the carriageway of the bridge near GIP Mall is nearing completion. This stretch across the bridge is likely to be completed by mid-March, authority officials said.
 
 Officials told TOI that civil work on the project is nearly complete. “We are putting finishing touches to the widened bridge flanks,” said Saumya Srivastava, deputy CEO, Noida Authority. “The work should be complete in two or three weeks, after which we will open it for traffic. Once the new bridge flanks are in place, they will be integrated with the old bridge for smooth traffic movement,” he added.
 
 The widening work began in December 2015. The plan is to change the existing four-lane bridge to an eight-lane one. “The aim is to decongest the area in the vicinity of Sector 18 and the two leading malls, which witness heavy traffic density. Also, the entry and exit points of Noida need to be congestion-free,” said Srivastava. “Once the project is completed, vehicles moving towards Delhi via the DND or towards East Delhi via Noida entry point near Sector 14A for Greater Noida, will become smoother,” he said.
