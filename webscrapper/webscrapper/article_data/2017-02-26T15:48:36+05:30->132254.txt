Parul Yadav, who was a victim of a vicious stray dog attack recently, is recuperating in a hospital in Mumbai. The actress underwent surgery for a deep gash she sustained on her head, as well as across her arms, on Wednesday, and is said to be recovering. According to Parul's sister  , the actress was walking their pet  ,  , within the apartment complex, when a pack of stray   that have set up camp in the society attacked Pluto.

 
  
 'Instinctively, Parul scooped Pluto up in her arms to protect him, but in the process, she sustained injuries, as the stray dogs then attacked her. The attack was quite bad and, initially, there was no one to help Parul. Hearing the commotion, our mother ran to her and with the aid of a couple of security guards, rescued her. We rushed Parul to hospital, where she will recuperate for at least a week, following which doctors say she can resume her normal routine. The surgery was successful, and the doctor says that she will recover well. Thankfully, there are no injuries to her face. Right now, she is just shaken from the attack. Ever since news of the incident spread, Parul's phones have been ringing non-stop and since she is in no condition to attend any, we are returning calls to update everyone about her condition,' says Hetal. Parul will remain incommunicado for about a week, after which she can resume work. The actress is to start work on the Kannada remake of 
 and her injury, we are told, is unlikely to upset that schedule.
