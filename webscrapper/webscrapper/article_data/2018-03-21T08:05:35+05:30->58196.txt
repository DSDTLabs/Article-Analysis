AHMEDABAD: In the fifth ‘con call’ centre bust in two months, a team of DCP Zone V squad nabbed four youths from Nikol early on Tuesday morning, for running a call centre making calls to the US and   its citizens. Police are yet to ascertain how long they had been operating and how much money they scammed. Police have found the group in possession of valuables worth Rs 2.17 lakh.

 Investigators said a squad was on patrol at 2am on Tuesday and received information on an illegal call centre functioning from Divya Jivan Smart Homes. The team raided the address and found Karan Bhatt, who lived there the address, and three others.
 
 “Bhatt, 22, along with Lelesingh Chauhan, 24, Kailash Jingal, both residents of Bapunagar, and Rahul Kori, 20, a resident of Naroda, would make calls to the US using a MagicJack device and Google Voice. We recovered four laptops and routers used for the purpose. The investigation so far revealed that the group would use the lure of payday and other types of loans to US citizens and coax victims into making various payments,” said an investigator.
 
 City police officials said that after the major call centre busts in Gujarat and Maharashtra last year, a number of youths associated with such large setups could have ventured out on their own with data available. All the recent busts have taken place at homes of the accused with set-ups not bigger than three or four computers.
