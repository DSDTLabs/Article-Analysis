BHOPAL:   on Friday held a protest against the replacement of Mahatma Gandhi by Prime Minister   on Khadi Gramodyog’s 2017 calendar. The demonstration was held around 2 pm outside the state PCC office and led by state Youth Congress chief Kunal Goswami.

 “This is a brazen attempt to finish the ideology of the Mahatma and crush Gandhian philosophy,” Goswami told TOI. “What does a Prime Minister who has been in the news for adorning a suit worth Rs 10 lakh have to do with khadi?” he asked.
 
 Youth Congress argued that the Prime Minister does not know the symbolism of khadi, which had a great significance during India’s freedom movement.
 
 “PM Modi has treated the   like Kingfisher’s calendar. We demand the MSME (ministry of micro small and medium enterprises) immediately withdraw the calendars and diaries of the Khadi and Village Industries Corporation and reprint the same with Mahatma Gandhi’s photographs,” Goswami said.
