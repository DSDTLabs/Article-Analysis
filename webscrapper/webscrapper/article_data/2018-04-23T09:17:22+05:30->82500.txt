ALWAR: Thirty-three illegal migrants from Bangladesh were arrested by the   police on Sunday, who also recovered   cards from 20 of them. The Bangladeshi nationals were arrested in a joint operation by CID (crime), intelligence bureau (IB) and Neemrana police.

 While 11 of them are women, 11 are children. A few of them admitted that they got the Aadhaar card by paying Rs 200 each to the owner of an e-mitra centre.
 
 Some of them have been obtained under a local address, while several others had West Bengal addresses. “How the migrants managed to get these cards will be investigated. Most of them have given fake addresses,” said Hitesh Sharma, SHO, Neemrana.
 
 “During interrogation, one of the arrested, identified as  , said that he got the Aadhaar card made from   town of Alwar district after paying Rs 200 to the owner of the emitra centre,” said a senior officer. IB had information about Bangladeshis staying in the area for a long time. “They came to India three years ago after crossing the West Bengal border by paying Rs 1,000 to some agents. They frequently changed cities and towns to avoid getting caught and shifted to   six months ago,” the officer added.
 
 Sleuths are also interrogating the whereabouts of agents who helped them cross over to India and travel to Alwar. “They are being questioned for information on the agent and the modus operandi,” the officer said.
 
 The documents of the accused have also been seized and are being verified. “They tried to mislead us by changing their statements. We have also sent a team to the e-mitra centre to find out the circumstances under which the Aadhaar cards were issued,” the officer said. After interrogation, the illegal migrants will be deported back to their country. “We have confiscated their Indian identity cards,” sources said.
