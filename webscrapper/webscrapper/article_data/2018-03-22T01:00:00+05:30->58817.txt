A ladies club in Kanpur recently gave a tribute to the late actress Sridevi. The club organised a 'Main Banungi Sridevi' theme party where all the ladies of the club came dressed as Sridevi. "We all love   and her demise came as a shock to us. At this party, we are paying a tribute to the versatile actress," said  , one of the key organisers of the party.
"All the members are dressed as Sridevi. She might not be there with us anymore but she will live in our memories," said Shalini Lamba, co-organiser of the party. Shagun turned up early at the do and received loads of compliments as she was perfectly dressed as Chandni. She was soon joined by Mala and Richa who were dressed as Rajni aka   and Amrish Puri aka Bhairon Nath of the film 'Nagina'.
