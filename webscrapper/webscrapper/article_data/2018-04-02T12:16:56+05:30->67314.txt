PUNE: The Comptroller and Auditor General ( ), in his recent report, pulled up the   ( ) for fixing the sale price of tenements in several district on ready reckoner (RR) rates rather than actual land cost.

 The districts in question are Pune, Satara, Solapur and Hingoli, and the report has rapped MHADA for overcharging lowand middle-income groups for “affordable housing” projects.
 
 The MHADA’s mandate is to implement affordable housing schemes for families that come under the economically weaker sector (EWS), low-income group ( ), middle-income group (MIG) and higher-income group (HIG).
  
  
 “Taking the price of land at RR rates, when the land cost was minimal to MHADA, was not in accordance with the MHADA’s pricing policy of August 2009. As a result of which, the prospective buyers would be charged excess sale price in the range of Rs0.81 lakh to Rs13.92 lakh per tenement (sic),” states the report.
 
 “MHADA fixed the rates as per the RR rates in these districts which has resulted in charging of excess profit on allotment of tenements to the extent of Rs8.08 crore, thereby putting excess financial burden on the families falling under Low and Middle Income Group,” the report further reads.
 
 In response, MHADA’s chief accounts officer said the RR rates were adopted for calculation of land as per the government resolution of May 2006, issued by the Revenue and Forest Department, due to non-availability of records.
 
 However, the CAG did not agree. “The replies are not tenable as fixation of sale price of tenements considering market rate of land is in contravention of MHADA’s pricing policy of August 2009,” stated the final verdict. Officials from the state revenue department stated that the matter was referred to the government last August, and that they’re awaiting a reply.
