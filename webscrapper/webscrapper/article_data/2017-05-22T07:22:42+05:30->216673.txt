KOZHIKODE: The   officials here are set to inspect all   engaged in ferrying school students before May end. Such an initiative was taken following the guidelines issued by  . 

 The plan is to check the fitness of the vehicles and to review the experience and qualification of the drivers. The motor vehicle department has been carrying out such pre-monsoon inspections to prevent road accidents involving school vehicles.
 
 "We will inspect all vehicles on Wednesday at Chevayoor driving test ground and at Mundikkalthazham road, Chevarambalam," said C J Paulson, regional transport officer. Vehicles which are not fit to carry out service will have to reappear for inspection after clearing the faults, he added.
 
 Last year, the motor vehicle department officials had found many of the school vehicles unfit for service during a mid-term inspection. Use of worn out tyres, tampering with the speed governor, dysfunctional headlights and wipers were the major faults detected last year. Use of quality tyres, wipers and headlights are mandatory for vehicles, especially during the monsoon as the use of worn-out tyres would increase the chances for road accident, said the motor vehicle department official.
 
 The motor vehicle department officials are also planning an awareness class for the drivers of vehicles facilitating the journey of students. The class will be held at Chevayoor on May 27.
 
 As per MVD guidelines, drivers of these vehicles should have 10 year experience and not less than five year experience in driving heavy vehicles. Besides, the school authorities and parent teacher association should monitor the behaviour of the driver and the aid to ease the journey of the students, said the official. An aid should be present in all the vehicles to help the students cross the road safely, he added.
