 The civic body had drawn a lot of flak recently due to the fire in its Jambuva landfill site. It took days to control the fire and even after this complaints of smog and smoke emanating from the site continued. While the civic body uses a chemical to control the smell emanating from the site, it was unable to handle the smoke that kept coming out of the site.
 
 The civic body prepared a proposal to use Renerzyme treatment at its site in case of fires. The proposal that was cleared by the standing committee last week states that the fires at the Jambuva landfill and the now unused Atladara site were due to methane gas that emanated from the garbage dumped there.
 
 According to the proposal, Renerzyme treatment could ensure that the fire and smog were controlled within a few hours. The technique was even tried at the landfill site at Jambuva and was found to be effective.
 
 The administration has proposed to procure the chemical from a city-based company. The civic body will be procuring the chemical at a rate of Rs 500 per litre. A ceiling of Rs five lakh has been set for the procurement.
