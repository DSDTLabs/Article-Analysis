HYDERABAD: Faced with numerous complaints of late night marriage celebrations, loud noises and clamorous ‘baraat’ processions, the   has proposed to direct all qazis in Hyderabad and other parts of the state to complete nikah (marriage) formalities before 9pm.

 Telangana state waqf board chairman and legislator Mohammad   told TOI that he had convened a meeting of qazis and senior police officials on January 23 to discuss the trouble caused to people due to noisy marriage celebrations till late in the night.
 
 Some marriage functions continue till the early hours with high decibel music played at baraat processions and inside function halls.
 
 “I had a meeting with police officials in  . The police have already announced restrictions on baraat processions with swords and loud drums. I am planning to restrict Nikah timings so that marriages are solemnised early and the entire event is completed by midnight. I have proposed to instruct qazis not to solemnise marriages after 9pm. The proposed meeting will cover the issue among others. Qazis and police officials will be present,” Saleem said.
 
 Saleem said he would consult religious scholars and take their help in restricting qazis from performing marriages late in the night.
 
 “For some reason, Muslim marriages are held very late in the night. There are instances of Nikah solemnised after 12 midnight. This disturbs those participating in the marriage function, and people living in the neighbourhood,” Saleem said, adding that he would implement the new rule strictly.
