New Delhi: Delhi University’s South Campus   along Benito Juarez Marg are hoping that Metro’s   would start services from September. 

 Durgabai Deshmukh South Campus station would connect five colleges with stations on the Yellow line and also link it through a foot overbridge to Dhaula Kuan station on the Airport Express line. This station would also cater to Jesus and Mary College and Maitreyi College. 
 
 “This will cut down travel time to North Campus as it would take within 35 minutes to reach Vishwavidyalaya station from Durgabai Deshmukh station,” said a DMRC spokesperson. 
 
 Inadequate public transport has always been a hassle for students in South Campus colleges. Most try to avoid B J Marg now because an underpass is being constructed there, resulting in rush. 
 
 “Students attending evening classes suffer the most as they face difficulty going home in the absence of any means of transport outside the college. The safety of women students is always a concern as they have to walk all the way to the Ring Road for autos or buses,” said S K Sharma, officiating principal of Motilal Nehru Evening College. 
 
 Most students travel to this college from Hauz Khas station. “Autos are few and charge exorbitant fares. “Often we have classes at North Campus and have to return to South Campus as our PG accommodation is here. So we spend nearly four hours travelling daily,” said Mohit Saini, an MA final-year student.
