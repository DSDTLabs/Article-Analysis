Recently, composer-lyricist   was announced as BJP’s candidate, in the upcoming by-election for the   constituency. As he takes the plunge in politics and files the nomination today, the composer says that he’s pretty excited about his move. Says Amaran, “I am happy to contest in this by-election. I always had this dream of becoming a good politician and was waiting for the right time to contest. Finally, the time has come.” 

 Elaborating about his work, he says, “As of now, I am busy assigning roles to my friends and workers on what needs to be done for the upcoming elections. I have been personally meeting a lot of people in my constituency and people are happy about me contesting in this election. It is surreal to see so much support from people — what with them waving their hands, shouting slogans and expressing their support for me — whenever I travel by road. I am pretty confident about winning this one. I will work for my constituency people, without any fear. I will not be a corrupt one like other politicians in   as I have no need for that.”
 
 Ask him whether he had faced any threat from other parties or politicians, he says, “No. By god’s grace, everything is going well, and I am just concentrating on winning this one.” 
 A chat with the composer and we can’t help but ask him about the controversy that revolves around his brother   and SPB. Amaren says, “Both have spoken to each other and the issue will be resolved in a couple of days. I spoke to Ilaiyaraaja recently and there are no hard feelings between them. I request people not to blow up this issue as many rumours are doing the rounds.”
