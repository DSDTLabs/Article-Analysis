GAYA: Shyam Sundar Sachdeva, father of   who was shot dead in a   case, on Monday appeared in the court of ADJ S P Mishra and supported the prosecution version that Aditya was killed by MLC Manorama Devi’s son Rocky for overtaking his vehicle.

 Senior Sachdeva is the first of seven prosecution witnesses to have supported the prosecution version. The other six witnesses earlier produced in the court, backtracked from their statements given to the police and judicial magistrate. They included four eyewitnesses who accompanied the slain boy at the time of the incident on May 7, 2016, and two constables deputed as house guards at the A P Colony residence of the MLC. 
 
 Sachdeva's testimony has come as a breather to the prosecution which earlier suffered several setbacks during the ongoing trial in which Rocky and his father Bindi Yadav, a former Crime Control Act detainee, are facing murder charges.
 
 Granted bail by the Patna high court, main accused Rocky Yadav was sent back to the jail as the   put the bail on hold in October last year.
 
 Public prosecutor S D N Singh was changed midway during the trial following the U-turn made by the witnesses. Singh was replaced by Sartaj Ali Khan as the new public prosecutor.
 
 A somewhat emotional Sachdeva snior narrated in detail the sequence of events of May 7 evening, the day a single bullet allegedly fired by Rocky hit Aditya in the back of his head. The 18-year-old was declared brought dead in the   the same evening.
 
 Sachdeva told the court that Aditya's friends, who were witness to the gruesome killing, on that day told him and other members of the family that Aditya was killed by the bullet fired by Rocky.
 
 Playing down Sachdeva's testimony, defence lawyer Syed Qaiser Sharfuddin said he was a “hearsay witness” and, as such, his testimony did not have much evidentiary value. The prosecution, meanwhile, is banking heavily on the scientific evidence collected during the investigation.
