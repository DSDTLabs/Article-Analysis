CHAMARAJANAGAR: Chief minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday likened  , RSS and   members to terrorists.

 He told reporters at Nagavalli, near Chamarajanagar, that there are terrorists in the BJP, RSS and Bajrang Dal also. “My government will not tolerate anyone who works like a terrorist and creates problems in society. Be it Popular Front of India (PFI), Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) or Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), we will initiate action against all those who try to create problems,” he said.
 
  
  
 “Since we don't have proof right now, we haven’t initiated any action. There is no proof that PFI is behind the murder of RSS activist Rudresh in Bengaluru. We will not tolerate anyone who tries to disturb social harmony,” he said.
 
 “BJP leaders don't have anything to talk about on development. So they talk about Hindutva. I am also a Hindu. My Hindu identity is in my name. But I am a Hindu with humanity, they are Hindus without humanity. We should not use caste and religion for politics. I have never done it in my life,” Siddaramaiah added.
 
 Taking a dig at BJP national president  , he said, “Shah is facing defeat in  . That’s why he is trying to divide society on the basis of religion. He wants communal clashes, lathicharge and is training BJP state leaders,” he said. Scoffing at the BJP’s Mission 150, he said the Gundlupet and Nanjangud byelections had derailed this dream, and   is aware of it. “The BJP can win just 50 to 60 seats. Instead of going to the people with the achievements of PM Narendra Modi, BJP leaders are busy creating communal tension. They want to win through violence,” he said.
 
 He also took a swipe at the BJP’s chief ministerial candidate B S Yeddyurappa, saying Shah was trying to win the state with the help of tainted leaders. Siddaramaiah dismissed Union skill development minister Anantkumar Hegde as “unfit even to become a GP member”.
