GURGAON: The district school safety committee conducted safety checks in two schools, Shalom Hills International School, Gurgaon and KDM Public School, Sohna. The committee comprising RTA (road transport authority) personnel, block education officers and police personnel, paid a visit to these   on Tuesday.

 Vinay Pratap Singh, the deputy commissioner said, “District School Safety Committee started the audit of schools based on the roster decided by draw of lots. In the first phase, 15 schools have been randomly selected and audit reports will be put up before next monthly meeting of the committee in the second week of February.” 
 
 “Everything was in order at Shalom Hills. We were given a checklist of 14 points by the education department. The school had valid fire certificate, female attendants were there in washrooms,   and GPS facilities were there,” reported Smriti Chabra who was part of the team that inspected Shalom Hills International School. 
 
 TOI team was also present during the checks. However, police personnel were not present with the first team.
 
 The arrangements at KDM Public School, Sohna, however, were not up to the mark. There were no female attendants in school buses, non-teaching staff were not trained to handle fire safety equipment, school buses were parked in a separate plot, to reach it students have to cross the road, the school does not have a parent safety committee nor any checks at the front door. 
 
 Saroj Kumari, block education officer, Sohna said, “We have found many discrepancies in this school. CCTV cameras were not there. Grilles in some windows were missing. The speedometer was not working. Chemistry laboratory did not have any running water. I will give this report and on the basis of that any action will be taken.”
 
  The safety committee will carry out security checks at Salwan Public School, Sector 15 on Wednesday.
