Across the country, the I-T department found 85 lakh transactions to be suspicious. “In   and Pondy, we found 28,000 accounts to be suspicious and some of the accounts had deposits in cash to the tune of Rs 85 lakh or more. 

 In the first instance, we send a mail to the account holder asking for details. Most of them have replied and some of the cases have been closed or they have joined the Pradhan Mantri   (PMGKY) scheme accepting that the cash was black money,” he said.
 
 But in some cases, despite several reminders, the account holders have not replied.
 
  “We will wait till the end of the month and go behind them. If they accept on their own, the   is only 45%. But if we find the money to be unaccounted, then the total tax will be around 83.5%,” the official warned.
