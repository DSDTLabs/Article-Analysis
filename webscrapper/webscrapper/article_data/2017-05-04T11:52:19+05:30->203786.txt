AGARTALA: Chief minister   on Wednesday said BJP is banking on money, muscle power and playing the communal card to win elections in the state, just as it did in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. 

 "BJP was dreaming of coming to power in  . That dream will never come true as people are happy with Marxist rule," Sarkar said. The chief minister was confident that   would hold fort despite all "conspiracies".
 
 Sarkar was addressing a gathering at the inauguration of the newly-built education directorate here. Saying that BJP secured only 31% votes in the last   elections, he added that the poll results in   and Goa reflected that the party had been rejected by the people. It could, he further said, form the government only because of the weaknesses of Congress.
