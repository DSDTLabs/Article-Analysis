 Sudesh Shandalya, the head of the Karunadham Ashram, Bhopal, offered his condolences saying, “Pyarelal Wadali, who was suffering from renal failure, had come to perform at the Ashram on December 15, 2016 after his dialysis despite doctors advising him not to exert himself.

 During the event at Ashram, Pyarelal Wadali had explained the meaning of Sufism. He had said, “Music is not Sufi, but the singer is. Sufi is not something that one sings, but someone with a pure heart who dedicates his life to the divine. People have started treating Sufi as a genre of music. But in reality, it is a phenomenon that makes the singer one with God through his voice and expression.” Vinay Upadhaya, who has hosted several events with the Wadali Brothers, recalled his association saying he came to know what the purity of heart was when he first met the duo in Bhopal in 1993.
 
 Bhakti Sharma, sarpanch of Barkhedi Abdulla village in Bhopal district, said, “I have a deeper connection with the Wadali Brothers as I hailfrom their village in Punjab. Though they were illiterate, they taught everyone around them the difference between literacy and education.”
