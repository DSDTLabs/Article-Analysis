HYDERABAD: Senior   leader   on Wednesday charged chief minister   with enacting a "drama" and playing a "double game" with the aim of fooling farmers in the state. 

 "KCR is trying to fool farmers by criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not having done anything concrete for the welfare of the ryots. If KCR is sincere in his criticism, he should ask his MPs to move a "no trust" resolution in   against Modi government," he said, adding political parties and MPs from AP are planning a no-trust move against the BJP-led government in Parliament demanding special category status for Andhra Pradesh. 
 
 Stating that neither farmers nor other sections of people are willing to trust that KCR is actually speaking against Modi, the Congress leader pointed out that the ruling TRS has earlier supported Modi-led BJP government in President, Vice-President polls, demonitisation and GST.
 
 Hanumanth Rao said that KCR had not uttered a single word against Modi when utter injustice was meted to Telangana in the   and when assurances of Reorganisation Act were not met.
