NEW DELHI: Though dates for admissions at   have been announced, there is no consensus on whether an   will be conducted. Certain sections — faculty members and student outfits — have been opposing the tests on grounds of “technical inadequacy” of the university. 

 Sources in the   say viewpoints of all stakeholders will be taken into account before a final decision is taken.  , ABVP member and DUSU general secretary, has been voicing his opposition to online tests, saying DU lacks the technical expertise to conduct them. He cited how DU college websites crashed several times last year.
 
 Sangwan said he was against online tests as “students from rural areas have no access to computers and the university also does not have special centers for use by such aspirants”.
 
 Akshay Lakra, president of Congress-backed NSUI, on the other hand, said ABVP’s opposition to the “progressive online entrance exam” was a political ploy.
 
 Sangwan insisted that was not the case. “We suggested to the administration that they have an entrance exam for one postgraduate course and see if it works. We want online exams only after all loopholes are plugged.”
 
 The university will begin online registration to its undergraduate programmes on May 22 — almost a month after it was supposed to begin. Admissions to postgraduate and MPhil/PhD courses will begin on May 31. The university administration had earlier decided to begin admissions in the third week of April to give students more time to apply.
