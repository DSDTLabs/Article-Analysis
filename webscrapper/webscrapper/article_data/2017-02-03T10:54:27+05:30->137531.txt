NAGPUR: CBSE-affiliated schools in Nagpur district were forced to reschedule their   by a week, to March 15, because the   announced it will supply question papers only from March 9.

 Earlier the  , which is administrative zone for Maharashtra, intimated schools to proceed with SA-2 in first week of March itself. Following this, the  , one of the biggest associations of   schools in entire country, has decided to scrap their earlier exam timetable and revise it soon with new dates. All CBSE schools in Nagpur district follow the same SA-2 timetable that is decided by Sahodaya office bearers.
 
 The SA-2 is the final theory exam for Std IX and the school-based exam for Std X students. The online question papers will be available to schools from March 9 onwards. 
 
 The question papers for SA-2 are generated online through a special web-based software of CBSE. As part of the digital push by CBSE, the board created a huge bank of question papers. Schools simply have to log on to the web site using their login credentials. Schools can either use the paper generated online or mix and match the questions to create their own paper. However, if they do the latter then the question paper has to be verified by the CBSE before being administered for the test. Due to this, every school prefers to use the question paper generated online. 
 
 This will be the last SA-2 (school based) to be held for Std X students because from next year CBSE has decided to revert to its traditional board exam.
