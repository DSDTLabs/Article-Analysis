DHURI: Mortal remains of Pritpal Sharma of   town in  , who was among the 39 killed in Iraqâ€™s Mosul city by the IS, were consigned to flames at a local crematorium on Tuesday. The coffin carrying his remains arrived at the local hospital late on Monday and was kept at the civil hospital.

 Inconsolable family members said they had completely been devastated by the tragedy. The last rites were performed at the Rambagh crematorium, which was attended by legislators from Dhuri Dalvir Singh Goldy and Sangrur Vijay Inder Singla, along with senior officials of the district administration. A large number of leaders of religious and social organizations, along with relatives of Prithpal Sharma, were also present during the rituals. 
 
 Later speaking to newspersons,   leader and Sangrur MLA Singla said the statement given by Union minister of state for external affairs General V K Singh (retd) was totally out of context and uncalled for. He said instead of expressing sympathies with those killed in  , the former chief of the   was indulging in fault finding and blaming the victims for the tragedy.
 
 Goldy said the government was tightening the noose around the neck of travel agents who dupe state residents by making false promises of better lives abroad. He said strict action was being mooted against such travel agents and government would ensure that no one is cheated in the name of foreign immigration.
