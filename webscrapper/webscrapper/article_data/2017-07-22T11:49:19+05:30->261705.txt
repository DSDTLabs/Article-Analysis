NEW DELHI: The   told the   on Friday that it doesn’t support   but as law and order was a   under the Constitution it was up to states to address the issue.
 
  Solicitor general   told a bench led by justice Dipak Misra, next in line to be chief justice when JS Khehar demits office on August 27, that the Centre’s stand was clear. “Law and order is a state subject and it is for the states to deal with the issue,” he said.
  
  “The Union government has no role to play in it. The government has told Parliament that it does not support any form of vigilantism.” The three-judge bench had issued notices to the Centre and seven states on April 7 seeking details on recent killings by socalled gau rakshaks.
  
  The notice was issued following a plea by Congress activists Shehzad and Tehseen Poonawala, who alleged that cow vigilantism had become a pretext to harass minorities and Dalits and enjoyed state support.
  
  Counsel for the Gujarat and Jharkhand governments said they had initiated criminal action in all such cases. The other states — Rajasthan, Haryana, UP and Maharashtra — sought more time to file replies. Karnataka was the only state that submitted a formal, written reply to court on the matter.
  
  Justice Misra gave the state governments and the Centre more time to file affidavits making their legal position clear and posted the case for further hearing on September 6.
  
  The SC also sought responses on a mechanism to check violent social media content designed to whip up communal passions over the issue.
