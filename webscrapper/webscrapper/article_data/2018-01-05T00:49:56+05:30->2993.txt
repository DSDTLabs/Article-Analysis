NAVI MUMBAI:   ( ) has become an open defecation-free (ODF) city just 14 months after the formation of the civic body.

 The state team had declared it ODF in August last year. However, an independent validation team from the central government that visited the city recently as part its nation-wide survey gave the final stamp.
 
 PCMC has been working relentlessly for the past 10 months to get into the select band of ODF cities. The administration has installed individual and community toilets, procured mobile toilets and created awareness. “Our efforts have paid off. Setting up more toilets and keeping a tab on open defecation have been a continuous process. We are committed to maintaining the ODF tag,” said Sandhya Bawankule, deputy municipal commissioner.
 
 Kisan Thorve, a Taloja resident, said, “There are few slum pockets, which are still prone to open defecation, where PCMC should provide more public toilets.” —B B Nayak
