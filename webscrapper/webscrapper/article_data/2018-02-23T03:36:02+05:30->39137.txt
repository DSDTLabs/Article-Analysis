NEW DELHI: With   becoming a hurdle in getting the right data on faculty members of educational institutes, the ministry of human resource development (MHRD) has decided to also use   numbers for its All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE), which is under way.

 
 The ministry has also decided to use PAN numbers in place of Aadhaar for those teachers who have been issued with the same for the forthcoming   ranking, which will be announced on April 3. 
 
 Many teachers were not happy over linking of Aadhaar with the process. While Aadhaar helped identify 80,000 ghost teachers in AISHE 2016-17, it also left many genuine teachers out of the total count. A senior professor of IIT-Delhi said, “Some teachers didn’t have the Aadhaar number and therefore the software didn’t capture the details of such faculty members and his/ her name was counted in the list of faculty of that institution.” 
 
 An HRD official said: “In some cases, teachers were having problems with Aadhaar and without that the process could not be completed. The government decided to allow the use of PAN numbers in such cases.”
