MALDA: Two persons were killed and another severely injured after a truck hit their bike and ran them over at Kaliachak’s Jadupur on NH-34 on Tuesday morning. Locals, who alleged that police paid little attention to traffic as they were busy “extorting money” from the truckers, blocked the highway for hours. They also chased and assaulted policemen, injuring at least five officers. Police said they have arrested two persons in this connection.

 According police superintendent  , the Kolkata-bound truck loaded with stone chips hit the twowheeler at 5.30am when the road visibility was poor due to fog. But the locals alleged that the truck began speeding at Jadupur to ditch the cops who were “extorting” money from truckers. A local resident said a police van started chasing the killer truck.
 
 “The truck driver tried to flee and ended up hitting the motorcycle. Three persons on the bike, all residents of Dariyapur and associated with leather business, fell on the road. While   (28) died on spot, the other two —Abdul Barek (22) and   — were severely injured. While Barek succumbed to his injuries on his way to the hospital, Sayed is battling for his life. The bodies of   and Barek were sent for autopsy,” said a source. The truck driver fled leaving the vehicle, which was later ransacked by the locals.
 
 Soon after the incident, locals ransacked a police van and pushed another vehicle into a nearby ditch. They then started chasing the officers who were on the spot. While some officers dived into the ditch, others were assaulted. Later, a huge police force from Kaliachak reached the spot. A scuffle broke out between the locals and cops, after which the latter resorted to lathicharge. Locals also claimed that the police fired a few rounds in the air, but the latter denied such claims. The situation was brought under control around 10.30am.
