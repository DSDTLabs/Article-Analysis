BENGALURU: Cab services will be disrupted in the city on Wednesday as various cabbie unions, including the  , Taxi for Sure and   Drivers' Association, are going on a day-long strike in protest against dynamic pricing, car leasing and other issues. Airport taxi drivers are also slated to join the strike. 

 Tanveer Pasha, president, Ola Taxi for Sure and Uber drivers' association said that drivers of Ola and Uber, various autorickshaw unions, airport taxi drivers' union and the   (CITU) will take part in a demonstration in front of the transport department, Shantinagar. Autorickshaw unions have said they will take part in the demonstration, but ply as usual.
 
 Drivers associated with aggregators Ola and Uber are going on a strike for the second time in less than a month.
 
 "The pricing strategies adopted by the two companies have not only affected Ola and Uber drivers but also drivers from different unions. A driver who used to earn up to Rs 80,000 can now barely earn Rs 15,000. Further, the increasing number of cabs on the road has led to many of our drivers not being able to run trips. Traffic on the roads is increasing, ruining business for all drivers. The worst part is that the government is just silently watching this," Pasha said. 
 
 "Many of our drivers have lost the will to live. Joining us in our efforts to seek justice, driver unions from Chennai and Hyderabad will also hold simultaneous protests on Wednesday," Pasha added.
