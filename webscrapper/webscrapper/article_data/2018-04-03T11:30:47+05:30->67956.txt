 The campaign was launched by first time parents Mrs Reshma and Vishal, who welcomed their new born at their residence in Kannarpadi ,   by planting a tree.   said, “The scorching summer has started already and we are happy to be the first couple to take part in the initiative. All parents should do it for a better future of their child.”
 
 “We have distributed brochures about the campaign at hospitals in the district. Parents were made aware about the need of plants to live a healthy life. Most of the parents agreed with the policy and promised to plant a tree in the name of their baby and we will provide them the needed support. In each home, when a baby is born, a   should be planted. Birthdays could also be celebrated by planting saplings,” Vinay Chandra, Mitra’s friend.
