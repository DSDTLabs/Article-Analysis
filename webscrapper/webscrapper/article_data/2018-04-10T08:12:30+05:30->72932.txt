AHMEDABAD:  , 34, who has been accused of cheating more than 1,500 people out of their hard-earned money by promising lucrative returns under an investment scheme called “Vimal Gold”, was arrested in   by Krishnanagar police on Sunday night.

  Inspector V R Chaudhary said Prakash Modi had been on the run since an FIR was lodged against him in January 2018. “Though he has cheated about 1,500 customers, only 70 have come forward to lodge a complaint against him. On paper, he has cheated people out of about Rs 70 lakh,” added Chaudhary.
 
 Sub-inspector Nikul Maru said Modi, while running a jewellery shop, floated various investment schemes under which clients deposited between Rs 100 and Rs 500 every month.
 
 “He had promised investors draws at the end of every month in which they would get gold jewellery. Investors who did not get monthly returns were to get gold jewellery against their investments at the end of the year,” added Maru.
 
 Before people realized they were being cheated, Modi fled with his wife and two children.
 
 “On finding the establishment closed, some investors filed a complaint. Before the cops acted on the complaint, Modi and his family had vanished into thin air,” said a police source.
 
 Chaudhary said they arrested Modi on Sunday after receiving a tip-off. “We are interrogating him to recover the money,” added Chaudhary.
