LUCKNOW:   Rajnath Singh, along with chief minister   held a review meeting with officials from the eight most aspirational districts in the state, asking officials to identify aspirational blocks within each of the eight districts and ensure their development through competitive means. 

 Out of 115 districts identified as 'aspirational' in the country, UP has eight. They are the areas which   has ranked very low on various human development indices. The eight districts in UP are Shravasti, Bahraich, Siddharthnagar, Balrampur, Sonbhadra, Chitrakoot, Chandauli and  . There are 49 areas under which the government will be required to intervene, which include health and nutrition, education, agriculture and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development and basic infrastructure. Singh said the Niti Aayog scores have shown that these eight districts have performed poorly on indicators of education and health though they have performed fairly well in agriculture. In fact, seven of the eight districts selected from UP were in the top 30 in the agricultural sectors across the country. In education, six of these eight were in the lowest 20 districts. 
 
 "For the sake of development, state and district administration should work together. To address daily problems, a committee has been set up which is equipped to take decisions on challenges being faced on ground. Through the process of rankings, Niti Aayog has tried to establish competition. However, officials should focus on the implementation of programmes and share their best experiences with other districts," Singh said.
