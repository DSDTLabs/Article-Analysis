AMRITSAR : As against the earlier proposal,   named after Sikh’s first master Guru  , will not be constructed at his birth place Nankana Sahib, Pakistan, but in the industrial city of Sheikhupura, about 50 km from Nankana Sahib. 

 The venue of the university has been shifted under pressure from local residents, who had protested against acquiring of their land for the university, which they believe would be spreading teachings of other religions and not Islam. 
 
 A group of lawyers of Nankana Sahib had been spearheading a movement, along with local residents, against the university and had been demanding the scrapping of the project. In recent past, they had also ransacked the office of the ETPB in Gurdwara Nankana Sahib Complex and manhandled its officials. The protesters had also put up banners with messages reading that the proposed university would teach Hindu, Sikh and Christian religion.
 
 Talking to TOI on Wednesday, Evacuee   (ETPB) chairman   said that in the wake of a land dispute with locals, the ETPB had decided to shift the proposed university to Sheikhupura and had acquired 100 acres for the purpose.
 
 “The university project could have been delayed if we had gone ahead with it at Nankana Sahib but now we have already acquired around 100 acres at Sheikhupura,” said Farooq, adding that the government had also earmarked an initial fund of Rs 100 crore for the university. Stating that he would make the announcement of shifting of university venue during the visit of Sikhs to Pakistan from around the globe on Baisakhi, the ETPB chairman said the administrative office of the university had already started functioning from Islamabad.
