TRICHY: The delta districts are likely to witness raging protests against the central and state governments over the delay in constituting the   (CMB) as farmers’ federations, political parties and advocates have planned a series of demonstrations next week. 

 Convening a meeting in Thanjavur on Saturday, the all farmers associations coordination committee decided to stage road and train blockades in Trichy, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and a protest in front of Trichy international airport on April 3. 
 
 Secretary of Cauvery Delta farmers welfare association,   said the central government sought three months time to form the CMB thus making it clear that the delay was because of the upcoming assembly election in  . “We have been accusing the central government of favouring Karnataka. Now, we are vindicated by the petition of the central government,” said Rengathanan. 
 
 Senior leaders of the association, P R Pandian, P Ayyakannu, S Balu Dhikshidhar and several others participated and unanimously decided to block the trains and stage protest in front of all the central government offices.   leader G K Vasan also joined the bandwagon by announcing a signature campaign across all delta districts over the issue in Thanjavur on April 4. 
 
 He expressed concern over the scattered protests by political parties instead of taking up the issue in unison. “Political parties are divided and they stage protest on their own in the issue which should be handled with the coordination by all the parties,” Vasan told reporters after a meeting with party functionaries in Trichy on Saturday.
