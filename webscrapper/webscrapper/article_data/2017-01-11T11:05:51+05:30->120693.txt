PATNA: Rashtriya   (RJD) chief   on Tuesday blamed   for sudden rise in demand for job under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) over the last two months. 

 “People who have lost their jobs after demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes are now seeking job under MGNREGA in the state,” Lalu said. He, however, did not specify the number of such persons or the source of his information. 
 
 “Prime Minister   had asked people to punish him at a place of their choice if he fails to improve the situation after 50 days of demonetisation. Sixty-five days have passed and there is no sign of improvement. The PM should now choose the place where people can punish him,” Lalu said, adding that demonetisation has ruined the economy of the country and GDP will register worst growth ever when the current fiscal ends. 
 
 Asked about family feud in Samajwadi Party, he said everything would be settled amicably and there will be no division of votes. “I talked to Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav and suggested him to honour the decisions taken by his father,” Lalu, whose youngest daughter is married to grandnephew of SP patriarch  , said. 
 
 The RJD chief added that he would also talk to Mulayam and request him to keep the party and family united as it is necessary to keep communal forces out of power in UP. “I know some people are trying to take advantage of the rift and split the vote in assembly election, but it will not happen. People of UP have already decided not to vote for communal forces or get swayed by false promises,” he said.
