Chennai: Death of three Tamil Nadu students near Pune while on educational tour has prompted the state government to impose severe curbs on school tour programmes.

 From this year, it shall be organised only with prior permission from government, time and destination must be planned at least two months in advance and should be finalised only after consultation with parents. The department has also restricted schools from taking students to rivers, lakes, waterfalls, seas and congested areas. 
 
 No tour shall exceed four days and the weather in the tour location should be taken into account, said the circular sent to all the schools by the director of matriculation schools on Tuesday. “Some schools have ignored the guidelines which were laid out earlier. This has led to loss of precious young life,” said S Kannappan, DMS.
 
 Referring to the recent accident at Pune, the director blamed the ECI school management as it organised the tour without permission.
 
 To prevent the occurrence of such untoward incidents, he has released a revised set of guidelines to be strictly followed while organising such tours failing which action would be taken against the headmaster and the management. Special sessions explaining the dangers in selected location, necessary safety equipments and preventive measures to be adopted in case of a mishap should be conducted for students going on such tours, reads the circular.
 
 One teacher should accompany every 10 students with staff and a trained first-aider. They should ensure that there will be no travel plans in between 10 pm and 4 am on road, it added. 
 
 Schools have been told to ensure that only experienced drivers with certified buses should be deployed.
