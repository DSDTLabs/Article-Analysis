LUCKNOW:   sharks are encroaching upon   to build houses and cash in on the realty boom in city outskirts.

 
  
 
 During a recent drive to free water-bodies of squatters, district administration found encroachers had levelled ponds and begun construction. Apartments and rows of houses were erected on at least three concretized water bodies.
 
 The drive was launched after the revenue department submitted a report, stating there are around 1,400 ponds in the district, of which 756 have been levelled and encroached by land mafia. Most of these ponds are in Bakshi Ka Talab, Sarojninagar, Mohanlalganj, Malihabad and Sadar Tehsil â€”areas witnessing a real-estate boom with expansion of the city.
 
 While multi-storied houses were found constructed in Sarojninagar, Bakshi Ka Talab and Mohanlalganj, at many places boundary walls were constructed around levelled ponds to build houses at a later stage.
 
 District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said of 756 encroached ponds, around 300 ponds have been freed in the drive launched by the administration in coordination with Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC), Lucknow development Authority (LDA) and police.
 
 Sharma said the administration found these ponds were lying encroached for over 10 years. Several drives to free ponds were carried in the past, but due to lack of follow-up and caution, land mafias grabbed the water bodies again.
 
 The drive will continue to free encroached ponds, which will be filled through ground water recharge system, rain water or recharged from the nearest canal or river.
