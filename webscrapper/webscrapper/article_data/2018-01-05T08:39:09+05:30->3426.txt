HYDERABAD:A criminal case was booked against   ( )   on Thursday for allegedly extracting resignations from some employees under duress and unleashing bouncers on them.

 In a written complaint, according to   police, three terminated employees alleged that on December 12 and 13 VDSI hired bouncers who threatened them with dire consequences if they did not sign on resignation papers put forth by the management. “Since December 12, we were each individually called into a meeting room, where the bouncers were also present along with an HR manager. The HR manager brought in printed papers of the resignation letters on our name and asked us to sign those papers,’’ they said in their complaint.
 
 When they sought time, the HR personnel rejected it. “When some of us tried to get up from the seat and move out of the room, the bouncers pushed us back and did not allow us to move. There was both physical and mental threat to us and the management coerced us into signing the documents. We would like to place on record that we did not sign the document voluntarily,’’ it said. A case was registered against VDSI under Sections 506 (criminal intimidation) and 341(wrongful restraint) of the IPC.
