HOWRAH: A youth in his late 20s jumped on the tracks near Howrah station on Wednesday afternoon when the New Delhi-Howrah   was being moved to the carshed. According to a source, the youth had a spat with a young woman at the far end of platform 8 before she walked away towards the main station. 

 Nobody paid him much attention till the train came to a halt after the loco pilot ran him over.
 
 As the accident occurred right after Valentine’s Day, it led to speculation on whether he took such a step because of a relationship gone sour. The authorities were not able to identify the victim as there was nothing in his pocket except for some cash.
 
 “The Rajdhani Express had arrived at platform 8 in the morning and passengers had left. An   team on patrol spotted a couple having an animated exchange at the end of the platform. The security men stopped for a while to check if the woman required assistance, but left after realising the duo knew each other,” a railway official said.
 
 “After the accident, we went through   footage and found that the woman, dressed in a salwar-kurta, left in a huff and walked towards the main entrance of the station. The man waited at the end of the platform. This was around 12.30pm. About 25 minutes later, just after the Rajdhani was being shunted to the carshed, he jumped in front of it. The loco pilot got no chance to apply brakes,” the official added.
