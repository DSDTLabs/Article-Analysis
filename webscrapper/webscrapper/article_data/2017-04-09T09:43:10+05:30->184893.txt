BHOPAL: Security of jails in   is being carried out through borrowed weapons!

 Grappling with acute scarcity of weapons, state prisons department has borrowed 10, 000 weapons (Self Loading Rifles and 303 rifles) from police headquarters.
 
 This happened after the department beefed up security across all prisons in the state following the jailbreak by alleged SIMI men from  . Alleged SIMI operatives had first killed a jail guard who was on duty and the managed to escape.
 
 After the incident, the jail officials initiated several measures to step up the security of the prisons in the state. These measures included improving infrastructure, technology, increasing human resource, sharpening up skills, as well as updating the armory.
 
 Sources said jail officials have already started training of the staff, and a batch was also sent for commando training with the   (NSG). However only seven personnel could qualify the screening there. Another batch will be send soon for screening tests, added sources.
 
 Jail department presently is in possession of outdated 410 Musket rifles that are used by the staff for jail security. In a bid to replace these, the officials have borrowed 10,000 weapons including SLR and 303 rifles as well as around 1200.38 bore pistols. These will be distributed among the jails across the state and the 410 Musket rifles will be replaced with it.
 
 “In all we borrowed 10,000 weapons on loan from the police headquarters. We also needed around 1.3 lakh bullets, but as it was not available with the police headquarters, so we wrote to the MHA for necessary approvals and we have already deposited the requisite fee,” additional director general (ADG) prisons, G R Meena told TOI.
 
 The jail personnel are however not trained to operate the sophisticated weapons like SLR and need appropriate training for the purpose. “We have already started training our personnel around a couple of months ago. These weapons will be systematically replaced with the trained staff,” Meena said.
 
 Explaining the process of loan, he said, “As the weapons are already available with the state police, we do not have to write to the Union ministry for them, but as police headquarters cannot give those weapons on their own. There is a process of taking the weapons on loan till the approval from the state government is final. We have completed all the procedures that are required and these weapons will be transferred permanently to jail department when the necessary approvals are received, till then, these weapons are with us on loan”.
