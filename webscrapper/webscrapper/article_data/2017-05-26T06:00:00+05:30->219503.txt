Naxalbari: Half a century may have changed  , but the slogans remain the same.

 The portion of NH-31 C from Panitanki on the Indo-Nepal border up to Shivmandir is now part of Asian Highway 02 that connects Nepal’s Kakarvitta with Bangladesh at Fulbari in Jalpaiguri. Most part of the road is four-lane and a huge flyover is coming up at Bagdogra. This road alone has raised price of land here at least by two times to even five times at places.
 
 “Most of the people who had land by the road have sold those. Now, they have bought small patches of land around Naxalbari and are building houses. One single road has changed everything,” says Prince Rao of Hatighisha.
 
 This is the place where police inspector Sonam Wangdi was shot dead with arrows fifty years ago on May 24, 1967 for demanding larger share of produce for sharecroppers, triggering a wave of violence later known as the Naxalite movement. On Thursd- ay, ultra-Lefts observed 50 years of the peasant uprising.
 
 Five pro-Naxal parties — CPI (ML) New Democracy, CPI (ML), Sramik Krishak Sangrami Mancha, CPI (ML) SOC and Somen Smriti Raksha Committee — had come together to observe the day. CPI (ML) Liberation did it separately under the leadership of Avijit Mazumdar, son of Charu Mazumdar.
 
 “Power comes from the barrel of a gun”, said one while another one shouted “Kishanji Zindabad”. Others gave slogans of “Naxalbari zindabad”. These slogans were being given in presence of a police force, which preferred to just watch the proceedings.
 
 Later, in a meeting at Siliguri Indoor Stadium, Naxalite leaders like Somnath Chatterjee, Sushanta Jha and Uma Kishan talked about extending support to the Maosists who are fighting in 10 Indian states in presence of figures like Santi Munda (who was present during the killing of Wangdi) and Kshudan Mallik (who had been to China on feet along with Kanu Sanyal, Dipak Biswas and Khokon Mazumdar and had met Mao Zedong).
