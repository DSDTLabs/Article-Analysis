PANAJI:   (GBA) has challenged, in public interest, the   (ODP) for Panaji, alleging that its arbitrary preparation and hurried notification will affect every citizen and their quality of life.

 The appeal filed in court by GBA, along with   (GHAG), pleads for a stay on operation of ODP, which was notified on December 28, 2016, a few days before the code of conduct was announced. It even carried a footnote stating that it can be read only together with the bylaws, but these were not notified till that time.
 
 While condemned the hurried manner in which the ODP was notified before elections, GBA convenor   said, “Any new plan should follow proper presidia and in this case, it hasn’t been done”. 
 
 GBA also alleged that the plan didn’t follow consultative processes or procedures, ignoring important bodies such as the corporation of the city of Panaji, the conservation committee, and inputs from civil society groups.
 
 “The committee passed the entire plan within 3 days of its last day of receipt of public objections/suggestions, a time far too short to prepare a comprehensive policy, based on feedback,” GBA secretary   said.
 
 “Arbitrary preparation and hurried notification of this plan will affect every citizen and their quality of life. We challenge this random method of planning and demand that we revert to a healthy planning process.” she added.
 
 Further, GBA alleged that the ODP lacked vision and research, in total contradiction of policies adopted for ODP 2011. Environmental implications from unnecessary re-development of buildings less than 10 years old, hi-density zones on steep slopes and random insertion of high density zones on singular plots, as small as 500 sq m, with no studies on congestion and carrying capacities of infrastructure, would affect quality of life, GBA alleged.
