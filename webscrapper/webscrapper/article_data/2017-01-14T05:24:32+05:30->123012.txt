MUMBAI: Sunday will be a special day for Manoj Khaire who has been participating in the Champions with Disability Run in   for 12 years. He will celebrate his 51st birthday on race day. 

 On Sunday, as Mumbaikars set their eyes on the largest run in the city, 111 people, including Khaire, will be celebrating their birthday on the track. 
 
 Khaire said, "This year I feel extremely special. Usually a birthday celebration would be a dinner with my son and wife, but this time I will get a chance to spread the message to save the girl child as I run in the morning. So it makes both the birthday and the run special." 
 
 Meanwhile,  , who turns 39 on Sunday, hopes to find a birthday cake waiting for her at the finish line. "Everyone around me knows that it's my birthday on race day and they are all excited. My husband is running with me and he will be waiting for me at the finish line-hopefully with a birthday surprise," said Lodha. It is her third time at the Mumbai Marathon. "I hope I can complete the half marathon in 2 hours 20 minutes-10 minutes faster than last time- but I haven't been running for the past few months due to a heel injury. If I can the complete the run with a good timing, it will be a birthday gift to myself," she said.
 
 Similarly, for   from Gurgaon the marathon is an icing on the birthday cake. "Last year, the marathon was two days after my birthday so I celebrated it en route Mumbai. This time, it is going to be a great day as I get to run on my birthday. I am running with 70 others and it is going to be a big birthday celebration," she said. She will be participating in the half marathon. 
 
 The youngest among those celebrating birthdays on race day is 14-year-old Vendant Arte. The   resident decided to participate in the dream run on his birthday for a cause. "I am very excited to run on my birthday because a lot of my friends are also participating with me. So I would not miss any celebrations," he said.
