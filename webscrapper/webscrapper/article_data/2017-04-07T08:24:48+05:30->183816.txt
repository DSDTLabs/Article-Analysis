AURANGABAD: The civic body has once again initiated the process of offering counters in the newly built fish market in   to traders and claimed that there is a good response this time around. 

 After receiving poor response from the fish traders on four to five occasions, the municipal authorities have now claimed to have attracted occupants for all the 48 blocks. 
 
 In a proposal, to be placed before the standing committee on Friday and a copy of which is with TOI, the municipal administration has mentioned that 43 of the 48 traders have agreed to pay a monthly rent of Rs 1,699. 
 
 The remaining traders would pay between Rs 3,330 and Rs 1,780 because the counters they have selected are at prime spots in the market, says the proposal. 
 
 For the past couple of years, the civic body has been convincing the fish sellers across the city to shift their shops to the state-of-the-art fish market. However, the traders have been shying away from moving to the new facility fearing drop in sales. 
 
 In December 2016, some of the sellers had agreed to take up the counters on a trial basis for a week or so when municipal commissioner   assured them that efforts would be made to popularise the market. But at the eleventh hour, the traders decided against shifting to the new place. 
 
 For three years, the civic body has been planning to streamline the city's unorganised fish markets and bring all the sellers under one roof. The authorities were also looking at organising five to six fish markets located at different places for health and hygiene.
 
 The project was initiated in February 2013, when the central government offered special funds to the civic body. Subsequently, the municipal corporation started building the modern facility on a 60x20-metre plot at Shahaganj and completed it within 18 months. 
 
 The project was carried out through funding from the   (NFDB).
