LUCKNOW: All   (class 1-12) studying in schools recognised by Uttar Pradesh government will not bring school bags on Saturdays. The   government has decided to make Saturday a ‘Funday’ by involving children in joyful activities. This, believes UP’s deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma, will lead to overall personality development of the child besides developing a positive teacher-student relationship. 

  Sharma, who is also the secondary and higher education minister, said this at a meeting held with education officials of UP and Haryana where he discussed the outcome of asking students to come without bags on Saturday. “A day without bags in schools is also looked would give relief to students who carry heavy bags that affect head, neck, trunk and the lower limb, changing the overall posture of their body,” this was a common refrain during the meeting.
 
 Besides, various surveys have found out that children today carry bags that are nearly 30-40% of their body weight, while according to guidelines, bags shouldn’t weigh no more than 10% of their body weight.
 
 The new idea however hasn’t gone down very well with the teachers’ association who believe that all play and no work will keep students away from school on Saturday. “Since there will be no classroom teaching, it may be possible that most parents would not send their kids to school. If it is all about indulging in playful activities, parents would rather keep their kids home,’’ said state secretary, UP  , RP Mishra. 
 
 He added teaching in first half and activities in the second half on Saturday can generate good results as it will serve both the purposes. “Some teaching will happen and at the same time, students will be relaxed,” Mishra said.
