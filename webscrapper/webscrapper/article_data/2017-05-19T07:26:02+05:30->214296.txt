NAGPUR: After dilly-dallying for over a year, the  , on Thursday, refunded Rs31.66 lakh, which were fraudulently withdrawn from the Nagpur University’s accounts in last February. The amount, meant for   staffers’ salary, was withdrawn through two forged cheques in the name of ‘Mahavir Constructions’ from Canara Bank’s branch in Yavatmal.

 NU media coordinator Shyam Dhond confirmed that the BOI had deposited the amount in NU’s accounts.
 
 BOI’s was forced to refund the money after NU severed its three-decade old ties with it and already started roping in other private sector banks like   for its various works. NU was also planning to shift its fixed deposits of over Rs200 crore to the Yes Bank, due to poor services and low interest rates offered by BOI. However, after auditors’ objection, it dropped the plans.
 
 BOI tried its best to avoid paying the amount to NU citing no progress into the investigations, and flip flopped many a times on refund issue while passing the buck on  . The fraud came to light when pharmacy department employees went to the bank and realized that the accounts was having insufficient funds. They then brought it to the notice of finance and accounts officer Anil Hirekhan, holding temporary charge.
