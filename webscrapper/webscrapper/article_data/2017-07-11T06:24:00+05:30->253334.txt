Nagpur: A girl resident in medicine casualty at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) was abused and threatened for life when she refused to discharge a patient on Sunday night.

 The patient was accompanied by 5-6 persons who didn’t budge even after repeated requests that a patient can be accompanied by only one relative. One of the persons misbehaved so badly with the female resident that she had to seek support of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) as the authorities failed to intervene.
 
 “The guards were completely inactive. They did nothing to prevent the relatives from abusing the girl. How could they allow so many persons with a single patient? Even in case of an emergency, only two persons are allowed,” said Dr Dinesh Sharma, GMCH MARD president.
 
 “Though I ensured that the person who was bullying and abusing was caught by the police and detained in the campus police chowki, the resident is scared to death and is refusing to make a complaint,” he said.
 
 Sharma said he will see to it that the guards on duty are taken to task. “I will meet the dean on Tuesday and lodge a complaint,” he added.
