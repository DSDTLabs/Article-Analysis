GURGAON:  , please note — working out in a lush green surrounding with fresh air will soon be a reality in the city. MCG has decided to set up 50   in   across Gurgaon over the next few months, with at least one in each ward to start with. RWAs will be responsible for maintaining the gyms in their respective areas.

 The corporation had done a pilot for the project which has shown very good response. The project has been approved and a budget provision has been made for the same. MCG had set up a few open air gyms in the city a couple of years ago under corporate social responsibility fund, but they failed as no one was assigned to maintain them.
 
 “Each of the 50 gyms will have around five to six different equipment in it, which can be used by residents anytime during the day. If the project turns out to be successful, it will be implemented in more parks across the city,” Ajay Kumar  , executive engineer (horticulture), told TOI.
 
 “We had done a pilot in one of the residential areas and it has been highly successful there,” he said, adding the project “draws inspiration from Delhi where such gyms are highly successfully and people actually queue up on weekends to work out”.
 
 MCG had earlier launched a similar project and opened a few gyms, but it did not succeed due to lack of maintenance. “Given that many parks in the city are now maintained by the RWAs, the gyms would automatically fall under their supervision,” said Nirala.
 
 The list of the parks where the gyms will be set up has not yet been decided. Earlier in 2015 as well, the MCG had provided a list of 64 public parks in the city to the district sports and youth welfare office for developing open gyms and health centres.
 
 The proposal had come after Haryana chief minister   announced that big parks in all districts across the state will have open gymnasiums. However, nothing much had happened beyond the announ-cements.
