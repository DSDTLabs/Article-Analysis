HYDERABAD: A   lodged a complaint at the LB Nagar police station alleging that an assistant motor vehicle inspector attacked him with the help of two other persons during an enforcement drive at   on Saturday. Reacting to the allegation, the female officer in question in her complaint to the police said that the lorry driver abused her while she was performing her duty. 

 LB Nagar police registered a case based on the complaint given by the officer  , while no case has yet been registered against the  , the lorry owner. 
 
 Reddy said that at 11pm on Saturday, his lorry was stopped by assistant MVI Goud at Sagar Ring Road during vehicle checking. "On the first count, Sagar Ring Road is not her jurisdiction. Second, when I pled to leave my vehicle, she started to abuse me and my driver for no reason. When I took objection, Swathi said that she would call the police and I supported her. Instead of calling the police, she called two private persons, who were well built and they attacked me badly,''   Reddy told TOI. 
 
 Later, when Srikanth approached LB Nagar police, Swathi also approached them, but he alleged that the two private persons fled by then. "Swathi claimed that the two well built persons were her brothers, and she used them for her security,'' said Reddy. While both parties gave their complaints, a case has been registered against the lorry owner on the charge of obstructing a government official from performing their duties.
