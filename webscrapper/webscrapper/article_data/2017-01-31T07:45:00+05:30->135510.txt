GURUGRAM: It’s spring so it must be time for the Ishara International   Festival, now into its 15th year. And this edition marks the 30th anniversary of the  , which will be staging India’s lone show, ‘Apples and Oranges’.

 Puppetry is humankind’s oldest (and surely its most delightful) form of storytelling. The beauty of it all is that a 90-year-old can appreciate this performing art as much as a nine-year-old. The fest offers the chance to enjoy age-old and funky-new puppetry, as you watch puppeteers use string and rod marionettes (and indulge in a bit of ‘shadow’ play). In amongst it all are hybrid performances marrying puppetry with dance, theatre, music and mime.
 
 The Ishara Puppet Festival gets under way with the life-and-liberty tale of ‘The Merchant and the Parrot’. Based on the verses of Rumi, this a collaboration between Afghani puppeteers and the students of a Berlin academy of dramatic arts. It will be followed, on day two, by the operatic ‘The Lantern Festival’, a piece by the Chin Fei Feng Marionette Theatre Troupe from Taiwan that celebrates the Chinese New Year. 
 
 Also featuring over the eight days is the Fairouz Nustas Puppet Theatre from Palestine (‘Home, Sweet Home’, with its engaging specially-abled hero), the Iranian duo of Homa Jeddikar and   (‘Mobarak and Me’) and Indonesia’s Electric Shadow Theatre (‘Theft of Sita’, in which the Ramayana is given a wonderfully contemporary twist). From Europe, one can marvel in the production of Sweden’s Marionetteatern (‘The Story of the Little Old Man’), and Spain’s   Puppet Theatre (‘Special Creatures’). 
 
 With Epicentre temporarily closed, the auditorium at   will host the shows. The festival will take place in Delhi, Gurgaon and Chandigarh, from February 3 to 10. Marionettes from around the world promise plenty of magic.
