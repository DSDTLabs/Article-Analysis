Jaipur: The CPI-M on Wednesday asserted that despite the crackdown on farmers by the state government, the protest at the Vidhan Sabha will continue as planned on Thursday. 

 Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Gurcharan Singh Mod said, “This government is clamping down on peaceful protest, in repression that has not been witnessed in the country since the days of the Emergency. 
 
 Farmers of the state have been gathering from different villages, arrangements had been made for vehicles to ferry farmers. The government is threatening the vehicle owners and arresting leaders of the farmers. What was planned was a peaceful protest to force the government to grant what was promised after the agitation in Sikar last September. There was a written agreement that the government had entered into and we wanted Rs 50,000 to be transferred to the accounts of all farmers who had availed loans, regardless of bank from which they had borrowed. We had also sought pension of Rs 2,000 per month for poor and aged farmers. The government had acceded to these demands.”
 
 Sanjay Madhav said, “We knew earlier too that the BJP government would not easily grant farmers the loan waiver. Even so, we felt it was our duty to engage with the government and accept its word. Now, we find that we must protest again to get the government to keep its word to farmers. This is a peaceful gathering, but farmers are restive. Leaders, who earlier managed to channel their anger and keep it peaceful have now been arrested. Those of us who remain will attempt to keep the peace. The government would do well to engage with our leaders who have been arrested and arrive at a compromise. The leaders of farmers cannot be treated like criminals,” Madhav said.
