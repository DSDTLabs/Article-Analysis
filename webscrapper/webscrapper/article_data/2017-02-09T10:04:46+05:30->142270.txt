  : One of the two minors detained for the murder of a 17-year-old boy on Tuesday was allegedly carrying a chopper in his school bag. The weapon was later used to attack the victim, the police said on Wednesday. 

 The crowded Panchavati area was rocked by the murder of the teen from the Phulenagar slum by Ganesh Bhalla (21) and his two minor accomplices. The two minor assailants, both aged 17, were returning home after appearing for a school exam when they met their older friend. The trio spotted Rutik alias   and killed him with the chopper.
 
 Police arrested Bhalla on Wednesday afternoon and detained the minors, both standard X students, for questioning. 
 
 During interrogation, one of the minors told the police that he had kept the chopper in his school bag. 
 
 "It is a dangerous trend where a standard X student carries a weapon in the school bag. We are now questioning the student to find out whether the weapon was taken to school or it was put in the bag later," inspector   of Panchavati police station said.
 
 Bardekar said the juvenile in whose bag the chopper was hidden also led the attack. None of those accused in the murder have any past criminal record, but have been involved in scuffles, police said. 
 
 Police said the trio attacked Rutik due to internal differences. "Rutik had beaten up one of the two minors a few days back. It was then that the trio drew up the plan to take revenge. The police are also looking if there are any others involved in the crime," the officer said.
 
 Police said the minor who carried the weapon wore a stoic look during interrogation. "But the other juvenile appeared to be shocked. He was barely speaking when he was questioned," Bardekar said.
