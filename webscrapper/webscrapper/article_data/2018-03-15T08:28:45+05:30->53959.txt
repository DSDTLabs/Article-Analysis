CHANDIGARH: The municipal corporation has started an exercise to charge all  , including dhabas, that have sitting arrangements for customers outside the main premises, a one-time security fee and monthly rent. The cash-strapped municipal corporation hopes to earn   of this.

 “In the first phase, we have launched an extensive exercise to make owners of   and eating joints aware of the exercise to pay security and rent to the MC to use land for sitting purpose. Department personnel are going from shop to shop for the purpose. After completing the awareness exercise, if someone is found flouting the norms, notices will be served and action will be taken as per the norms laid down,” said  , joint municipal commissioner.
 
 As per municipal corporation records, around 48 eateries and eating joint owners have applied to the MC to take permission so that they can run their business smoothly.
 
 Sources in the civic body said they do not have exact numbers at present and a detailed survey is being done to ascertain how many eateries and food joints make sitting arrangements outside their shops in the evening. 
 
 “Although the exact number is yet to be ascertained, there are hundreds of small and big booths and shops, which have been using MC land for the purpose,” sources said.
 
 Sources also said these food joints are spreading throughout the city, but southern sectors have more such places. The matter was extensively raised in the monthly house meeting. Former city mayor and BJP councillor   took it up in the meeting, saying it could turn out to be a major source of revenue.
