LUCKNOW: Mayor   got a first-hand experience of the citizensâ€™ plight on Monday when she went for a surprise inspection of the Lucknow municipal corporation ( ) control room in   and the officials there failed to give details of pending cases to her.

 The   officials are often criticized for delayed response on phone and late redressal of complaints. As soon as Bhatia sought details of pending complaints, the computer, which was working well till she reached the control room, froze all of a sudden. Launched four years ago to register telephonic complaints, the LMC control room had given deadlines for redressal of problems many times but is blamed for poor server, phone call drops or not connecting at all.
 
 Many people have complained that the problems are shown as resolved even though they are not redressed. On an average, the control room receives 300-400 complaints daily and LMC is supposed to resolve them within the set deadline. Bhatia asked the team to submit records of complaints received and resolved to her as soon as the server responds.
