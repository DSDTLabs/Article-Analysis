BENGALURU: India's second-round   (Asia-Oceania Group 1) tie against   is likely to be played on the mediumfast hard courts of the Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association here from April 7-9.

 Bengaluru, always a popular choice among players who prefer hard courts over grass, India's traditional strength, should get the All India Tennis Association's nod. It's learnt that the conditions, mainly altitude, made the   the players' choice. India, who beat   4-1 in Pune in early February, also on outdoor hard courts, will come up against tough opposition in the Denis Istomin-led Uzbekistan. The big-serving 30-year-old, who was ranked 33 in the world four years ago, shocked defending champion   in the second round of the Australian Open, where he made the round of 16.
 
 The second-round clash, which will see multiple Grand Slam doubles champion Mahesh Bhupathi debut as non-playing captain, could also see the return of the country's topranked players in singles and doubles Saketh Myneni and   to the side. If India win the tie, they'll earn themselves a place in the elite   play-off round.
