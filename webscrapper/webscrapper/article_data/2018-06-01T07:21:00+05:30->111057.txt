 According to officials from Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), forest fires in Uttarakhand and a rise in wind speed were responsible for the increase in concentration of particulate matter. “The city has been witnessing an increase in wind speed at least once a week. This, coupled with forest fires in Uttarakhand, is leading to an increase in PM2.5 every week,” an HSPCB official said.
 
 When asked why graded response action plan (GRAP) has not been implemented yet, the official said, “GRAP can only be implemented if the pollution levels remain in the ‘very poor’ category for at least 72 hours. The problem is that we are witnessing a lot of fluctuation in the pollution levels. However, an advisory was issued this month after the recent dust storm to all departments asking them to take adequate measures in order to combat pollution,” he said.
 
 Experts said while other cities generally witness in pollution in the summer, Gurgaon witnesses an increase. “In Gurgaon, PM2.5 levels rise as the dust levels are high due to construction activities. It is also due to increased use of gensets as power cuts are very frequent during summer,” said Niranjan Raje, former member of Environment Protection Control Authority.
