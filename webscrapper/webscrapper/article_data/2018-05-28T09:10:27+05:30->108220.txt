MUMBAI: Apart from BCom and  , colleges across the city say demand for commerce degree with a specialization in accounting and finance tops everything. In fact, if one compared total applications to seats available, BCom (accounting and finance) would emerge as the number one choice.

 
 “In a city like Mumbai, a graduate of this course gets a job easily. Also, the subject is very scoring,” said former commerce dean Madhu Nair. Principals attribute the demand for this course to its curriculum design, which provides a lot of practical elements.
 
 
  
 
 Some of the top colleges that saw the largest pool of applicants for this course were  , K  , SK Somaiya, HR College and   in Churchgate.
 
 K J Somaiya received 7,916 B.Com applications, followed by Mithibai which received 6,459, SK Somaiya (5,894) and HR College 5,825 applications. Again for BMS, the largest number of applications went to Mithibai, Jai Hind, K J Somaiya, HR College, KC College and NM College.
 
 In the order of preference, vanilla BSc came next. And BSc with Information Technology followed with 93,406 applications. “While biotechnology is picking up, BSc (IT)’s demand has not fallen since the course started. A lot of those who don’t want to pay very high fees for engineering or join a little known college turn to BSc (IT) and most colleges run this course to full capacity,” said former pro-vice chancellor and principal of Birla College Naresh Chandra.
 
 Principals reckon that placements are also what attract students to this course. “Several IT firms that recruit in large numbers pick BSc (IT) graduates and those who are good learn quickly on the job and rise up to the level of other engineers,” he added.
