Chennai: The Madras high court on Friday directed the Hindu religious and charitable endowments department to make all necessary arrangements including, security measures, for the Thanipoosa Jyothi Dharisanam in Vadalur, scheduled to take place on January 31. 

 The first bench headed by Chief Justice Indira Banerjee passed the order on a suo motu plea initiated based on a letter addressed to the court by D Selvakumar, a resident of Nagapattinam, seeking court’s intervention to provide appropriate facilities during the function.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing, the department submitted that all basic amenities would be provided and already measures have been taken to install 500 toilets and bathrooms for devotees who will be visiting the temple for the function.
 
 “All arrangements, including temporary rooms for changing of clothes for the women, have been made. This apart, on January 27, a special meeting is also scheduled to be held headed by the Cuddalore district collector, to review the arrangements made for the function,” the department said.
 
 Recording the submissions, the bench disposed of the plea.
