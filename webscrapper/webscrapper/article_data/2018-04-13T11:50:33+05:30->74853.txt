JAIPUR: The political drama continued on Thursday in the state with senior   members, including parliamentarians and cabinet ministers, observing a day-long fast against disruptions in the parliament.

In Jaipur, BJP’s elected representatives including cabinet minister Arun Chaturvedi, MP Ramcharan Bohra, state women commission chairperson Suman Sharma,  , counsillors and others had gathered and observed the fast collectively.
 
 Addressing the gathering, state party president Ashok   said that Congress’s day long fast for communal harmony on April 9, was a farce. ``The   should introspect its political sins right from making   the prime minister over Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. It should also think about the penance,’’ said Parnami.
 
 At the end of the day long fast, PWD minister Yunus Khan blamed nepotism in Congress party for the bad governance in the country. While addressing the media at the BJP state headquarters, Khan pointed out to the absence of former chief minister Ashok Gehlot in the assembly and said that people of Rajasthan have selected him to raise their problems on a bigger platform, not for performing his services for one family.
