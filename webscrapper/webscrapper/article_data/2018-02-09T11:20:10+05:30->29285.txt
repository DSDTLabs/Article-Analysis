 This was informed by Nashik commissioner of police Ravinder Kumar   during the inauguration of high-tech towing cranes and vehicles on Thursday.
 
 Four towing cranes and 8 towing vehicles were pressed into service from Thursday. Singal said when an illegally parked vehicle is towed away and the traffic personnel or men concerned make a mark at the place of the illegally parking saying that the vehicle has been towed and a concerned police is to be contacted for paying the fine.
 
 “On many occasions, some other vehicle gets parked at the same place or during rainy season, the marking made by the police on the road is wiped out. This leaves the motorists worried about his/her vehicle,” he said.
