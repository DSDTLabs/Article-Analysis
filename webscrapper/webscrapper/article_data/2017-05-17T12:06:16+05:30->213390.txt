In Sasural   Ka's Tuesday (May 16) episode, reporters come outside the Agarwal house. They show Anjali a video where she can be seen hugging and shaking hands with Sam. They accuse Anjali of cheating on her husband, and winning the competition by unfair means. Hearing all this, Vikram is dazed. Anjali calls them all false, and shuts the door. Saroj blames Anjali for ruining their reputation in society. 

 Elsewhere, Ridhima tries to kill   with a sword. But she is unsuccessful in the first attempt. When she does so again, Simar stops her and yells at her for trying to kill her son. Ridhima justifies her action but Simar refuses to listen.
 
 
  
 Anjali is furious at Sam and decides to handle the situation herself. Vikram blames her for putting herself in such an awkward position and doing things the wrong way. Anjali is, however, unfazed. 
 
 Piyush turns into kaal, a giant monster. He rushes towards Ridhima and others to kill them, which changes Simar's mind. She prioritizes family over her son, who is kaal now. She stabs him, and kaal disappears.
