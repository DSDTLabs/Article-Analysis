LUCKNOW: The runway at   (Amausi) will be expanded to make it suitable for the landing of Dreamliner and Jumbo aircraft. State government has released Rs 56 crore out of Rs 550 crore proposed for the work. The work will begin this week.

 At present, the   is 2.15km long which is not apt for the landing of any jumbo aircraft carrying 500 passengers. This is the reason why many   do not come to Lucknow.
