AURANGABAD: The   (MCI) has decided to bring all medical practitioners in the country under a single digital system by issuing each of them a Unique Permanent Registration Number (UPRN). The move is aimed at dealing with duplicate registrations, quackery and regularisation of medical practice, and ensure bond discipline.

  official from   Ramesh   said on Saturday that the uniform registration system will help doctors who have to change their places of practice.
 
 “Earlier, doctors who migrated faced difficulties since they were registered with the medical council of a different state. The UPRN will help such doctors. It will also make it easy to search for registration of doctors,” said Rohiwal. Although the medical fraternity has welcomed the move, a key hurdle is the renewal of doctors’ registration in Maharashtra every five years.
 
 Rohiwal said that the   (MMC) requires doctors to complete one year and two-year bonds for the renewal of their registrations. This is for doctors who completed their graduation, post-graduation and super-speciality degrees from government medical colleges between 1980 and 2000. Many such doctors never served the bond and are now practising privately, said Rohiwal. Doctors said that the government had no vacancies for them to work, which is why they could not complete their bond.
 
 “Now, while renewing their registration, they are being asked for the bond-free certificate. Those who did not serve the bond are required to pay compensation, which is also applicable retrospectively, including interest, which adds up to an unrealistic amount,” said Rohiwal.
 
 Senior IMA official Kuldeep Singh Raul said the UPRN was the first step towards developing a centralised healthcare database.
