Ludhiana: As soon as the existing MC General House session came to an end on Wednesday, MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh took over as the administrator of the municipal corporation. He will be the sole in-charge of the entire working of MC Ludhiana. However, he did not find any major changes in the working style of the department, and the only difference will be the absence of councillors, who usually remain active in getting the problems of residents resolved through officials.

 Jaskiran is also completing his six months as MC commissioner in the city, and is ready to handle the new responsibility. However, it is for the first time that an administrator has been appointed for MC in the past 25 years, as regular MC elections used to take place. Therefore, it has to be seen what changes will take place in the entire civic body.
 
 Jaskiran Singh said they had already started several mediums for the registration of public complaints, and these were being redressed as well. He said people could complain on the direct numbers of MC officials, MC’s web portal, and MC’s recently launched mobile application, adding that like earlier, people could even now approach MC officials through their former area councillors, as they would be heard and their complaints resolved at any cost. “We can also think of starting some toll free number for receiving complaints, in case there is a major issue,” he added.
