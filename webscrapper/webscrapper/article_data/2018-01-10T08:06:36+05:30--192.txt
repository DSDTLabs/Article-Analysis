CHENNAI: On January 18, six eminent musicians and dancers will come together to raise funds for a worthy cause. But what sets the event apart is the fact that Carnatic vocalists Nithyasree Mahadevan, Sowmya S and  , and Bharatanatyam dance gurus Roja Kannan, Revathi Ramachandran and Ambika Kameshwar will be presenting select compositions of a 13-year-old boy who is autistic.

 “A CD of his songs, Smaranam, was released by Ambika Kameshwar in 2014,” says   Anand, Vishal’s mother, who calls her son an ‘autistic savant’, ie, an individual with autism who has extraordinary skills not exhibited by most. “He used to write slokas since he was four every Ayudha Puja and these were slowly developed into songs,” says Vidhya, adding her son has also authored two books. “He wrote the first one, which was about his experiences in school as an autistic boy, when he was six. The second one focused on children with difficulty in communication,” she says.
 
 “I like music and most of my songs are about various forms of goddess  ,” he says.
 
 The CD has 15 songs, most of which are in Sanskrit. “While the Carnatic musicians will perform his songs, the dancers, including myself, will be staging a performance based on one of his compositions,” says Kameshwar.
 
 “Vishal’s mother wanted to see how his skills can be used to benefit other children and that’s how we came up with the idea of organising this fundraiser,” added Kameshwar, who founded Ramana Sunritya Aalaya (RASA) in 1989. She is a pioneer of the ‘theatre for holistic development’ methodology, which uses the creative arts as tools of learning, and works with children with special needs.
 
 The programme is in aid of RASA’s work with young adults and differently-abled adults, she said.
 
 To support the cause, people can buy donor passes, or sponsor donor passes, which will enable other children in the city to attend.
