Thane: A one-year-old and eight-year-old boy were among the four people who were admitted to Thane civil   after a stray dog went on a biting spree at Court Naka on Wednesday morning.

 The eight-year-old boy, Miyesh Mane, was waiting outside a salon for his father near the police ground when suddenly the dog came out of nowhere and bit him on his right thigh.

As I had finished early, I stepped out of the shop and was waiting for my father. Just then, the dog came running and bit me. ,” said Mane.
 
 The child was administered seven injections in order to prevent the infection from spreading.
 
 The stray continued attacking other pedestrians as well. A police constable Jaya Mhaskar (53) was the dog’s next  . “I was on duty when the dog came and bit me from behind. I have never received any complaints from residents in the area about dog menace. So this was unusual,’’ Mhaskar said.
 
 The dog bit two more patients Payal Walmiki (20) and one-year-old Rohit Pawar. Walmiki, a flower vendor at Jambli Naka market, sustained injuries on her right leg, while the child who was sitting next to her was bitten on his ear.

 Meanwhile, the dog has been caught and has been sent to a civic-run animal hospital at Wagle Estate.
