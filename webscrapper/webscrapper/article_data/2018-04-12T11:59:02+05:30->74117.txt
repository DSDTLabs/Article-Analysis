PANAJI: The committee of ministers constituted to look into the exemption of bars from the Supreme Court’s highway liquor ban has decided to frame parameters to ensure that a ‘maximum’ number of establishments in the state fall outside the ban’s purview. 

 The panel, comprising urban development minister Francis D’Souza, revenue minister Rohan Khaunte, and town and country planning ( ) minister  , met on Wednesday and heard the grievances of traders whose licenses were not renewed owing to the SC order. 
 
 “The committee has decided to adopt the   and Development area (PDA) as one of the parameters for giving relaxation to liquor licenses,” Sardesai told TOI. Thus, licenses within the Mopa PDA and surrounding areas would be exempted. He said that the  , in its modified order earlier this year, allowed bars in substantially-developed areas and those close to urban areas to be exempted from its ban. 
 
 “Around 1,000 licenses have already been renewed,” Sardesai said. “These are localted in substantially-developed areas.” 
 
 This financial year, as many as 1,332 licenses were not renewed owing to the ban. The ministerial committee, in its last meeting, decided to issue relaxations to 1,021 licenses following the SC’s modified February order, after which the committee was constituted. The remaining 311 would be considered on a case to case basis. 
 
 The Supreme Court’s original order asked governments not to renew licenses of bars operating within 500m of either a state or a national highway. Then, in February this year, the SC left it to the discretion of state governments, subject to certain conditions. 
 
 In early 2017, the Goa government had conducted a survey and found that 3,400 licenses were operational in the prohibited area of 500m. Around 2,000 of these were renewed after the the SC’s modified order.
