Vadodara: The district primary education officer (DPEO) of Chhota Udepur has sought details of WhatsApp groups in which primary teachers working in the district are active.  A circular was issued last week to all taluka primary education officers to submit the details of the groups so that no comments or messages against the district education committee are made by the teachers. “I have only sought how many WhatsApp groups are active in each taluka and who all are the admins of these groups,” said Mahesh Prajapati, DPEO, adding, “Often teachers make comments and question the administration of the committee which is not correct.” On whether this was intrusion of teachers’ privacy, Prajapati said, “We are not asking to close the WhatsApp groups, we have only sought details of admin and how many groups are functioning.” Interestingly, the committee has not limited its action at seeking details, but has also decided to take legal action including a police case of cyber crime. “Making comments against the administration is an act of indiscipline according to the rules of district panchayat,” the circular signed by Prajapati read. However, no details have been submitted by the taluka primary education officers. There are around 5,000 primary teachers working in Chhota Udepur district.
