A venue in   was abuzz with musical energy on Saturday as city-based artistes and bands took the stage and belted some numbers across various genres. Young music enthusiasts turned up in support for the local talents and they, in turn, were treated to some pretty good performances by the multi-genre line-up. From the folksy sounds of 
Sidharth Bendi, the acoustic solo project Visita, rock and blues band  , three-piece groove machine   to the experimental melodies of Ferdinand Dâ€™Souza, it was a musical night that celebrated local musical fervour.
