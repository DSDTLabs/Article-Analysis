On the first day of the new year, many of us made new beginnings and   made one too. After staying away from social media for the longest time, the 'OK Jaanu' star made his debut on Facebook. 

  
  
 Aditya joined Facebook on January 1, 2017, following in his 'Fitoor' co-star  's footsteps. The actress, on her part, had a sweet message for him as she welcomed him to the world of 'likes', 'comments' and 'shares'. 
 
 
  
  
 Ever since she joined the social networking site on her birthday in July last year, Katrina has been very active with her selfies, posts from her exotic vacations and 'live' chats. 
  
 Aditya seems to have learnt quickly ' he too went for a 'live' session on Monday evening, where he addressed his fans and promised them that he will stay active and respond to their comments and love.
