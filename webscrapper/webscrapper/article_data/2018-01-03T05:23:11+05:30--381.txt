PUNE: With a sharp drop in  , damage to railway tracks —   like   — poses threat to safe train operations every winter. 

 To prevent any untoward incident, the Pune railway authorities have arranged for extensive patrolling during the late night and early morning hours.  , the Pune divisional railway manager (DRM), said a team of officials will check if the station managers and gatemen were sleeping on duty.
 
 “Winter is a sensitive time for the railways with tracks developing a lot of complications. Fog is also an issue. We have told all the station managers to be on alert late at night and early in the morning. The station managers must stand on the platform and observe rains passing through and monitor the functioning of the signals. The same goes for the gatemen. Stringent action will be taken if anyone is found sleeping on duty,” he said. 
 
 The official added the “winter patrolling” had been extended between 6 am to 8 am. “There are different kinds of problems which the railway tracks face due to the cold. The teams check the tracks for cracks, welding failures, too much moisture etc. A track, which has developed a crack, needs to be fixed without delay. A process called de-stressing of the tracks — which includes proper maintenance, plugging of technical etc. — must be carried out,” he said.
 
 Apart from the rail officials, personnel of the railway protection force (RPF) have also been alerted, another official added.
 
 “More thefts take place during the winters. Taking advantage of the cold, the thieves may steal signal related wires, fish plates etc. The RPF men have been told to patrol the tracks, mainly during the night,” he said.
