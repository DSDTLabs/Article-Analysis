PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Residents of Gawarewadi in Maan village on Friday cremated a body on the road in the absence of a crematorium in the area after land was acquired for the Hinjewadi Information and Technology (IT) Park.

 Sandeep Sathe, the deputy sarpanch of Maan village, told TOI, “Parmeshwar Gaware (32) of Gawarewadi died because of some illness.
 
  His relatives and villagers conducted his last rites on the road in Gawarewadi near the old crematorium.”
 
 Villagers are not allowed to cremate bodies in the old crematorium for the past three years after a large number of industries came up in its vicinity. 
 
 The state government had acquired land in the villages of Hinjewadi, Maan and Marunji for the Hinjewadi IT Park around 10 years ago.
 
 Explaining the reason for the extreme step, Sathe said, “The state government had acquired the land in Gawarewadi and other parts of Maan village around 10 years ago for constructing the   It had acquired the crematorium land in Gawarewadi, too.”
 
 He said people continued to use the old crematorium for a few years after the land acquisition because there were no IT industries in the area. But of late, a large number of industries have developed here. 
 
 “As a result, the villagers are not allowed to conduct cremation there,” Sathe said.
 
 The villagers were assured that alternate land would be allotted for constructing a new crematorium at Gawarewadi.
 
 “The state government issued a letter of allotment of six guntha (6,000sqft) land for the purpose. But the original land owners are not allowing the gram panchayat to construct the crematorium for the past two-and-a-half-years,” Sathe said.
 
 “They threaten to commit suicide and to attack the workers. So, we have not been able to construct the crematorium. As a result, villagers have to cremate bodies on the road outside the closed crematorium,” he added.
