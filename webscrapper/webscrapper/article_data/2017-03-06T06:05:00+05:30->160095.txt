BHOPAL: People in Jeetudhana village in   that hogged national headlines in the year 2012 — after then President of India,  , felicitated Anita Narre, for refusing to stay at her in-laws house due to lack of a proper toilet, are largely dependent on forests for defecation. 

 “Nearly 40% of the houses in my village do not have toilets because villagers have no means to build them”, said Anita.Five years after MP government made her the brand ambassador for creating awareness on sanitation, she has only been taken to just one village to promote sanitation. At present, Anita is working as a farm labourer. “It was in 2014 that I was taken to Khandla panchayat for creating awareness and was paid Rs 500. A year later, I was asked to go for five-day training at Ujjain. I went and attended the training sessions. My food and lodging was provided but I had to bear the travel expenses on my own. Since then, I have not been taken anywhere,” Anita told TOI.
 
 “I work in farm and also motivate people. Even in my village which has around 100 houses, nearly 40% do not have toilets”, Anita said. The villagers are provided financial support for constructing toilets but money is dispensed by the government only after they are built, said sources. On March 20, 2012, Anita was felicitated by the Pratibha Patil at the   in New Delhi.
