NEW DELHI: The nine students suspended by   administration over alleged “disruption” of the   meeting were allowed to   for the next   on Wednesday.

 “We informed the rector that it would be curtailing of our rights if we are not allowed to register for the next semester,” said Rahul Sonpimple, BAPSA member and one of the suspended student.
 
 The university has allowed the students to register till the findings of the proctorial inquiry come out. After registration, the suspended students can stay at their hostel rooms and can eat at the hostel mess.
 
 The students still maintain that they were “peacefully” protesting outside the meeting venue on December 26 demanding that the upper limit of viva voce marks be brought down to 15 from 30 as per the UGC gazzette notification of May 2016 for admissions to MPhil and PhD courses at the varsity.
