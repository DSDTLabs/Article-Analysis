THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Shaken by widespread public outrage, as well as criticism from within the LDF, over the use of unnecessary force by police against  's mother and kin on Wednesday, chief minister   made the right placatory noises but seemed to concede little in terms of concrete action. Speaking at an election rally at Thazhe Chelari in Malappuram, he said the government has taken all steps to ensure justice to Jishnu's family. 

 Jishnu's mother   remained in medical college hospital here, determined to continue her protest till the government punished policemen responsible for Wednesday's violence and till those behind her son's alleged murder were brought to book. 
 
 A preliminary report on Wednesday's incident which the range IG was supposed to submit to the DGP on Thursday got delayed. It is learnt that the report states there is no proof of police excess though it recommends that the way the whole episode was handled should be examined. There are indications that some police officials involved in the incident might be transferred on the basis of the report.
 
 The police also decided to set up a team under ADGP (crimes) Nitin Agarwal to nab the accused who are absconding in connection with Jishnu's death. A reward of Rs 1 lakh was announced for those who share credible information on the absconders. The police have also decided to speed up procedures to confiscate assets of the absconders.
 
 While the first and second accused -- P Krishnadas, chairman of   of engineering, Pambady and public relations officer of the college  , respectively, are out on bail -- vice-principal M K Sakthivel and faculty member C P Praveen are absconding.
