PATNA: With   round the corner, shops in and around the city have stocked up products ranging from various colours, ‘gulaal’, ‘pichkari’, mask and artificial hair for the revellers. People have already started buying Holi products from wholesale shops on Nala Road.

 Traders said instead regular toxic colours, customers prefer herbal colour capsule as it easily dissolves in water. Like ‘rocket blaster’ in Diwali, ‘abeer blaster’ filled with herbal colours are also much in demand this Holi. 
 
 A new product that fills 60 water balloons in one go has found many takers this year. Coloured smoke bombs that can be set off by lighting seem to be a hit among adolescents. Companies selling herbal colours have also developed a cream-based colour that can be washed off easily. 
 
 Baby, a stationary shop owner, who is temporarily selling Holi products, said ‘gulaal’ is an all-time favourite, but people are also opting for herbal colours. “Wooden gift boxes of herbal colours and foam animal masks are also in high demand along with colourful wigs of different hairstyles,” said Baby. “Witch hats, long hats with hair and sombreros have also made an entry this year,” she added. 
 
 A number of shops could be found selling Chhota Bheem, crocodile, umbrella, flute ‘Motu-Patlu’ and Doremon pichkaris.
 
 “Kids are opting for cartoon pichkaris such as ‘Ben Ten’ and ‘Motu-Patlu’. Water guns with tanks are also well loved. A new air gun is available that builds up pressure and throws a stream of water,” said Raj Yadav, another shop owner. He, however, added that adults are opting for classic pichkaris only.
