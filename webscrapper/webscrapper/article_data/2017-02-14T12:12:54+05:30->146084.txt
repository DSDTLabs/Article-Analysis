Sources said that majority of students who passed out from science stream have never entered labs for experiments.
 
 "Over 70% of the government schools from Indore district do not have operational practical labs. Schools which have labs are also in poor shape. Either there no teacher to assist the students for practical or there are no equipment in the lab for students to perform experiments," said KK Arya, a senior government school teacher from the city.
 
 He also added that labs have been created but the grants that are allotted to schools for marinating these labs are not used in the right direction. "Earlier there were lab technicians in each school but now those lab technicians are not there and there is no one to maintain the labs and equipment," added Arya.
 
 In Class 9 and 10, every science subject - chemistry, physics, biology and computer science - has 25 marks each for practicals.
