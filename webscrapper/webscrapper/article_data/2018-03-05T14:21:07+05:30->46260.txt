CHENNAI: Fishermen at the   harbour have been landing an unusual   over the past month – an elongated shark-like   with fearsome sharp-edged teeth.

  
  
 
 Known as the knifetooth dogfish, the species is usually found in the east Atlantic and south Pacific regions, said  , a researcher from Chennai-based biodiversity research organisation CareEarth. However, the fish has not attracted much interest from local fish consumers, he added.
 
  
  
 
 A fisherman K Subbiah from Royapuram said those in the trade involved in deep sea fishing have been netting it, adding that the quantity of the catch is on the smaller side. “Each fish weighs nearly 2-3 kg and fishermen get only about 10-15 kg during each trip,” he said.
 
  
  
 
 With no takers for the species in the market, the fish is directly being sent to shark oil extraction units in the city which buy it for a pittance. “Each fish fetches Rs 10 per kg and after oil extraction the flesh is dumped as waste,” he said.
 
  
  
 
 Despite its intimidating appearance, Vigneswaran said the fish is a harmless sleeper shark caught from waters ranging from the level of 200m to 1,600m.
 
  
  
 
 Information with the   (IUCN) suggests that very little is known about the biology of the species.
 
  
  
 
 Reported as relatively common in the eastern Atlantic, the fish has only been captured in very small numbers in commercial trawls and deep-water surveys west of Scotland. The species is taken in bottom trawls, with line gear, and with fixed bottom nets.
 
  
  
 
 Catch declined between 1992 and 2001, which may be attributable to a shift in the depths fished, economic reasons and probable over-exploitation of both target and bycatch species.
 
  
  
 
 There is no specific information available on the population of the species. Its deep distribution, largely outside the range of current fisheries, affords the fish some protection from exploitation, according to the IUCN.
