 Additional deputy commissioner of   district H Prasanna informed Bangalore Mirror that the administration has already approached Dr Vaidya Vidyadhar from Pune and the trial runs are currently under progress.
 
 Vidyadhar is the owner of Celestial Flights based in Pune that promotes aero sports. A glider pilot, he has vast flying experience.
 
 He told Bangalore Mirror, “This is probably for the first time that boat winch hang gliding will be introduced in India.”
 
 Explaining how it works, Vidyadhar said, “The glider takes off from the boat and once it attains the required air speed the payout winch starts releasing the line until the hang glider attains about 1,000-2,000 feet altitude. The pilot then releases himself from the winch to complete a circuit to land back in the water. The experience is going to be a beautiful one as one can capture the panoramic view of the river kali backwaters. Flying without the noise of an engine is by itself a wonderful experience.”
 
 Currently one hang glider has arrived and the trials are being conducted regularly. The team hopes to stabilize itself by the end of this month and the formal launch is expected after the monsoon season.
 
 Aero sports in Uttar Kannada is gradually picking up. The district administration has introduced several projects for the promotion of water sports.

 During the last Karavali Utsav, the district administration introduced para motoring on Karwar beach; and now the state is all set for the introduction of boat winch hang gliding.
