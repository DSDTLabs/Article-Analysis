Panaji: The directorate of technical education (DTE) on Friday was directed to fill medicine degree seats in Goa as per the provisional list the DTE released earlier this week. The interim order from the high court of Bombay at Goa comes as a temporary relief to the around 125 MBBS seat aspirants in Goa, who had missed the deadline to apply to the seats.

 The next hearing in the case is scheduled for Monday. The continuation of these provisional admissions will, however, be subject to further orders of the court.
 
 The case pertains to the around 125 medicine seat aspirants in Goa, who approached the court after they missed the deadline set by DTE to apply for the seats. 
 
 The students said they were unaware that they had have to apply for medicine seats before the   results were out as admissions were based on NEET scores. The students 
 
 approached the high court, which on July 10, in an interim order, asked the DTE to release the provisional list and merit list for medicine seats by including these 125 students. The DTE accordingly released the list on Wednesday.
