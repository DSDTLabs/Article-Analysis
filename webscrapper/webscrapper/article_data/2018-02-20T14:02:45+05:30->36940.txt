MOTIHARI: Bhojpuri   Ajay Anant alias   has lodged a complaint at Dhaka police station in East Champaran district against one Babbal for abusing and threatening him to kill if he did not withdraw his video on   chief Lalu Prasad. 

 The song titled ‘Chara ghotala me pakarayele,   ke kangal banayele, Rabri rowatari pit pit matha (Caught in fodder scam, made Bihar bankrupt and left wife Rabri wailing) from the album titled ‘Lalu Bum’ has apparently gone viral on YouTube.
 
 “You withdraw the video against Lalu ji from YouTube or I will kill you,” Ajay in his complaint lodged on February 11 has quoted the don telling him over the phone. Ajay stated that the caller called himself a don from Munger.
 
 The album was uploaded to YouTube after Lalu was convicted in the Deoghar treasury case of multicrore fodder scam in December last year. Babbal allegedly asked him to sing songs in favour of Lalu, like another   singer Chotu Khesari.
 
 “The caller said many filthy comments were posted against Lalu family on my song, which is very bad. He also said I belong to RSS and have sung songs on their persuasion,” Ajay said and added, “The caller also told me that it was easy for him to kill me or any of my family members.”
 
 Dhaka SHO   said an FIR has been lodged and police are using scientific methods to nab the caller.
