NEW DELHI: Five passengers on an   shuttle bus at IGI airport sustained minor injuries on Friday after a window shattered due to   blast, allegedly from a SpiceJet   getting parked at a nearby bay. 

 The bus was ferrying passengers for Indigo Flight 6E-191 bound to Mumbai when the incident happened.
 
 An IndiGo spokesperson said that the ground staff alerted airport officials and the passengers were taken to the airport clinic for first-aid and medical assistance. The flight departed only after ensuring all passengers were provided with proper assistance.
 
 “Spicejet SG-253 aircraft turned to park at the allocated bay during which the jet blast broke the right front window glass of IndiGo Coach number 34, parked at bay 17,” said IndiGo in a statement.
 
 Sources said that while two passengers proceeded to board the aircraft after treatment, three others were accommodated in other flights.
 
 “The matter is being investigated by the safety department and the regulator. At IndiGo, safety of the passengers is of utmost importance,” the statement added.
 
 A SpiceJet spokesperson, however, said an investigation was underway and it was too early to determine the cause the incident.
 
 “The Chandigarh-Delhi flight was following ATC instructions and taxiing after landing at Delhi. It is too early to say if the incident was caused by an outside object or jet blast or the bus violated the vehicular movement lane,” said a SpiceJet spokesperson
