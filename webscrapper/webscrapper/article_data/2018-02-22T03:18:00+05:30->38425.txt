Guntur: An octogenarian woman was burnt alive after her thatched house caught fire at Upparapalem of Ponnur mandal in Guntur district, on Wednesday. The deceased was identified as Muddaraboina Tirupatamma (81), who lived with her daughter Bhagyalakshmi, in the house.

 The incident took place at around 6 am. Bhagyalakshmi, who works as a daily labourer, left home at 4 am. Officials said an electric short circuit might have ignited the fire, which spread across the thatched house before neighbours could save Tirupatamma. Ponnur rural inspector Sheik Nafees Bhasha said the house was gutted within minutes. Tirupatamma was probably asleep when the fire started.
