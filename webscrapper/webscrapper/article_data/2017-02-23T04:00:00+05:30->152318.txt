Ahmedabad: Mahatma Gandhi’s vision to make khadi a tool of self-empowerment has got very few takers in his home state Gujarat. The decision of the state education department to make all officials and teachers wear khadi on Tuesdays continued to be a flop show for the second straight week.

 On Tuesday, only officials of the education department and presidents of various teachers’ association were seen wearing khadi. Pankaj Patel, president of the Higher Secondary Teachers’ Association in the state, said, “The decision to wear khadi on Tuesday was a flop this week too. The decision of the education department has not been getting a good response from teachers and school staff,” Patel said. 
 
 Earlier this month, education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama had decided that all teachers and officials of the education department would wear khadi on Tuesdays.
