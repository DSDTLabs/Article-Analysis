KOCHI: The state government has opposed former chief minister Oommen Chandy’s contention before the high court that his government did not consider the necessity of appointing an inquiry commission in  .

 The   has now filed a counter affidavit that said the necessity of appointing an inquiry commission was in fact considered by the   government as per the order issued by it for appointing the commission.
 
 
 Senior advocate   had argued on behalf of Chandy that while deciding to appoint the inquiry commission, the UDF government had not arrived at an opinion that there was any substance to the allegations related to solar scam.
 
 The affidavit filed by the home department said, “That the government were of the opinion that solar scam was a matter of public importance and that they were also of the opinion that it was necessary to appoint a commission in terms of Commission of Inquiry Act to inquire into such scam is discernable from Exhibit P4 government order (to appoint the commission). The satisfaction of the government that the matter pertaining to solar scam is a matter of public importance is thus revealed from the recital in Exhibit P4 GO itself.”
 
 A decision to appoint the inquiry commission was taken at a meeting of the council of ministers on August 16, 2013. The matter was mooted as an out of agenda item by the then chief minister, the affidavit said.
 
 “Though the note prepared by the office of the chief minister and placed before the council of ministers as out of agenda ought to have been appended to the files, it is not now seen attached with the files,” home department has alleged in the affidavit.
