CHANDIGARH:   head Gurmeet   Singh on Monday moved Punjab and Haryana high court against his conviction in the two rape cases and submitted that CBI, which is the prosecuting agency, had not conducted his potency test.

 Gurmeet had claimed before the trial court that he was not virile since 1990, much before the rape allegations were levelled against him by the two sadhvis.
 
 “The prosecution did not get the medical examination of the accused-appellant done to prove that he was capable of performing sexually,” Ram Rahim’s counsel said in his petition filed in the HC. Counsel   said in the petition that the trial court had rejected Gurmeet’s claim of losing virility since 1990 by pointing out he had fathered two daughters. However, the petition said, the daughters were born much before 1990. Gurmeet was convicted of raping the two sadhvis inside the dera premises in Sirsa and the special CBI court in   had sentenced him to 20 years of imprisonment last month.
 
 In another development, the special CBI court at Panchkula dismissed the plea filed by Gurmeet’s former driver Khatta Singh to depose against the dera chief in the ongoing murder cases against him. Special CBI judge Jagdeep Singh found no merit in Khatta Singh’s plea.
