His foot in a cast, former Haryana chief minister   embarked on a six-month long yatra in the state on Sunday, to take on the Manohar Lal government. A massive crowd of nearly one lakh people collected at Hodal on the Haryana border where the yatra was launched as Hooda attacked Lal’s record as the chief minister.
 
  This comes after the   had held a motorcycle rally in Jind on February 15 where BJP president   launched the party’s   in presence of the Chief Minister and backed him.
  
  “Top BJP leaders gave a call there to the crowd to shout so loud that their voice reached Bhupinder Singh Hooda. The massive crowds at our rally and Yatra from Palwal to Hodal today shows people came to make their voice heard to the former CM about the non-performance of the Manohar Lal government,”  , the MP from Rohtak and son of the former CM told ET.
  
  “I will not sit quiet till the Manohar Lal government is wiped out of the state,” the ex-CM said.
  
  The MP said the former CM has decided to take his yatra to all constituencies of Haryana over the next six months, including all small towns and big villages and has embarked on the same on schedule despite his foot being in a six-week long cast after a fall he had sustained earlier this month.
  
  Hooda is facing legal troubles on account of charges of alleged dubious land allotments in his tenure as CM and BJP president Amit Shah had attacked him in his Jind rally on such allegations of corruption. “They (BJP) are perusing politics of vendetta. These are false cases which will ultimately fall flat. Nothing has come out against the ex-CM in any case or inquiry so far,” the MP said.
