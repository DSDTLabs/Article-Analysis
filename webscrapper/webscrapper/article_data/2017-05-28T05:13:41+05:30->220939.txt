NEW DELHI: Countering the opposition’s charge of Modi government’s failure to generate jobs,   Narendra Singh Tomar said on Saturday that 813.76 crore person days of work were generated in the past three years under flagship schemes of just his ministry alone. 

 A person day, also known as man-day, is the amount of work done by one person in one working day. 
 
 Tomar said the expenditure on rural development jumped from Rs 58,630 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 95,099 crore in 2016-17, which is a 62% increase. He added the government’s top agenda is to improve the quality of life of the people in rural areas. 
 
 The Prime Minister’s Office had recently asked all ministries to give details regarding employment generated by them during the last three years amid growing criticism from opposition that government had failed to keep its promise of generating two crore jobs annually. 
 
 Tomar said the government enhanced expenditure to make gram panchayats poverty free and his ministry aims to increase it to Rs 1,05,448 crore for 2017-18.
 
 The minister said maximum 636.78 crore person days of work was generated under MNREGA, followed by 98.97 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana and 78.01 crore under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. 
 
 Tomar said the Centre is also enabling rural households to access self-employment opportunities. The minister said under the Deen Dayal Upadhyay-Grameen Kaushal Yojana in 2015-16, around 1,35,000 candidates got jobs.
 
 On the progress of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, he said rural sanitation coverage has gone up from 42.01% in October 2014 to 63.97% in May 2017.
