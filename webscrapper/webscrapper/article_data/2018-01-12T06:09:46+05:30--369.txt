KOLKATA: A blaze in an under-construction housing project in  , where a 4 BHK apartment costs an upward of Rs 2.80 crore, triggered panic in the upscale neighbourhood sending motorists scurrying for cover and owners who parked their vehicles near the building waiting anxiously for the flames to ebb.

 The fire broke out on the first floor of   in New Alipore beside the   drainage pumping station a little after noon. More than 200 people were working inside the underconstruction complex, spread over 250 cottahs.
 
 The blaze, fuelled by ply boards and inflammable chemicals, gutted a balcony and portions of the first and second floors. Nobody was injured in the fire. Since the housing project is flanked by railway tracks on one side and roads on two sides, there was no danger to any of the apartment blocks nearby.
 
 According to a fire department officer, the fire broke out in one of the rooms on the first floor. “The place was stacked with wooden ply boards, chemicals like thinners and cable wires. All the three substances are highly combustible. The fire started when some welding was under way and one of the ply boards caught fire. Five engines worked for over two hours to bring the blaze under control,” he said.
 
 An officer said there wasn’t adequate water in a reservoir inside. “There should have been more water inside. We had to ferry water in the fire tenders,” he said.
