VISAKHAPATNAM: At a time when cops are preparing to ensure the peaceful passing off of the   scheduled to be held on January 27-28, they received a jolt from the blue in the form of a   demanding   for Andhra Pradesh at RK Beach on the Republic Day.

 Inspired by the jallikattu agitation at Marina Beach, Chennai, the people of AP took to the social media and called for a silent protest at RK Beach in Vizag. According to sources, more than 20,000 to 25,000 youth from north Andhra and Godavari districts are expected to participate in the protest. 
 
 Opposition leader  , Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan and Left parties have extended their support to the agitation. However, cops claim that no one has applied for permission for the protest at RK Beach. Incidentally, YSRCP had planned a candlelight rally on the evening of Republic Day at RK Beach, but cops did not give permission to that rally either. “No permission will be given even if the organisers of the silent agitation apply now. A red alert has been sounded across the country on Republic Day and we do not want to give any chance to anti-social elements,“ said city police commissioner T Yoganand.
 
 According to sources, the state government had planned to deploy Octopus ( ) and the antinaxal elite force Greyhounds during the CII summit. However, in view of the protests on Republic Day , the government may assign them duties from January 25 itself.
