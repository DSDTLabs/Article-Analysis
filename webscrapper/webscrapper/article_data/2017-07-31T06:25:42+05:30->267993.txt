MIDNAPORE: In February 1982 the foundation stone of the   master plan was laid. The same year, in December, actor-turned-MP Dev was born. 

 Three-and-a-half decades later, when Dev (now the Ghatal MP), while touring the flood-ravaged zone on Sunday, promised to raise the Ghatal master plan issue in Lok Sabha on Monday, the irony couldn’t be missed.
 
 Ghatal is among the worst-hit in the floods, which have claimed 31 lives statewide. It isn’t the first time Dev will be flagging the issue in Lok Sabha either. His maiden speech in Parliament in August 2016 reflected the irony: “In 1959, the Man Singh committee first named a plan called the Ghatal Master Plan. It took 20 years for the Planning Commission to approve the plan, and finally in 1980 the plan was sanctioned; in 1982, the foundation stone was laid. In the same year I was born. I have grown up so big but the foundation has not turned into Ghatal master plan yet.”
 
 On Sunday, Dev told reporters: “I will go to Parliament tomorrow and raise the issue.” He said the Trinamool government was trying its best to implement the master plan but to no avail. 
 
 Before that, Dev visited the flood-affected blocks of his constituency. He reached Daspur block I by noon and spoke to people rescued from the villages. From Daspur, Dev travelled two hours to reach Ghatal, stopping now and then to take stock. He met   district magistrate Jagadish Prasad Meena, who has been camping at the SDO office to coordinate rescue operations.
 
  Nabanna sources said the flood situation remained grim on Sunday. In Howrah’s Udaynarayanpur, the body of a 55-year-old woman was found on the Damodar bank. She was identified as   from the inundated Sultanpur village. 
 
 State minister Arup Ray supervised relief and rescue work in Udaynarayanpur and Amta II blocks — among the worst hit in the floods.
