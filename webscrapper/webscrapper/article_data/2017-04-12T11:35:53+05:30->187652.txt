In a poll conducted by TimesOfIndia.com yesterday (April 11) on Facebook, asking the audience whose comedy show would they prefer to watch -   or  's, the fans of the warring comedians picked Sunil Grover. Hence, making him a clear winner.
 
 While the poll was on, many viewers debated in the comments section about the talent that the two bring to the stage to entertain the viewers, but mostly sided with Sunil for the style with which he plays his characters, citing   and   as their favourites.
 
  
  
 For the uninitiated, Sunil has decided not to return to   after leading showman Kapil Sharma allegedly abused and misbehaved with him on a Melbourne-Mumbai flight.
 
  
  
 While Sunil continues to boycott 'The Kapil Sharma Show' and is unlikely to return, there are reports that he might just come back with his own show with comedian Chandan Prabhakar, who played 'Chandu Chaiwala' on TKSS. Sunil had earlier, too, tried to venture on his own with ' ' leaving Comedy Nights With Kapil, but it turned out to be a failed attempt.
  
 Talking about the same, a source had earlier told The Times Of India, "Talks are on and several meetings have taken place, but Sunil is biding his time. He is getting offers from other channels too. He would be happy to take Chandan Prabhakar along as well. Chandan was also treated badly by Kapil on the same flight, which is why he too left the show."
