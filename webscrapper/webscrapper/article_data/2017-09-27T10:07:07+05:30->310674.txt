CHENNAI: Former deputy Prime Minister and   veteran   on Tuesday said setting oneself free from western culture was the path to real freedom and we should strive to free ourselves from it.
The 89-year-old was the chief guest at the platinum jubilee celebrations of Jaigopal Garodia National Higher Secondary School at Tambaram. He had laid the foundation stone for the new premises of the school in 1979 when he was   minister.
 
 Advani said it was necessary to remain humble as it was an `ornament of education'. “A person having many degrees, should never become proud. Pride leads to a fall,“ he said, addressing hundreds of students.
 
 Advani shared the dais with BJP MP Ila Ganesan, TN Tamil development minister K Pandiarajan, AIADMK MPs V Maitreyan and K N Ramachandran and DMK MLA from Tambaram S R  . Maitreyan recalled that he had been a close associate of Advani when he was in the BJP in the 90s.
 
 Raja scored a few political points as he stressed the need for a bus terminal in Tambaram which could fructify if the defence establishment parted with some land.“When Advani was a minister at the Centre, he allotted some land. Now a Tamilian, Nirmala Seetharaman is at the helm of the  . We hope she can give some land for this,“ Raja said.
