Rajahmundry: The natural flow of perennial river   has weakened in the last five decades. This has forced farmers of the twin districts to endure hard times.

 Irrigation authorities have already stopped water supply for rabi season in the area. The water level at Sir Arthur Cotton barrage was 13.08 metres as per last reading. The flow of Sileru into Godavari has been stopped due to annual maintenance of Sileru Complex. Only 8 tmc of water was merged into Godavari through Sabari in April. The water level exceeded dead storage limit of river Godavari of 11.80 meters at cotton barrage.
 
 The main reason for low natural flow is poor rainfall in catchment areas of the river. The present situation has alarmed officials. Less than 1,000 tmc of water flowd into the sea this year against 2,000 tmcs which goes to waste on an annual average.
 
 Another significant development which was noted in the last season was the flood level did not cross warning sign. In this rabi season, only 19 tmc of natural water is available and water had to be drawn from Sileru, Balimela and Mothugudem. About 69 tmc of water was drawn from Sileru. This is unprecedented. In this context, Polavaram irrigation has become really important as Krishna and Godavari deltas can be stabilised through this project. Telangana government is constructing several projects on river Godavari in the upstream.
 
 Now, Polavaram project is the only hope for farmers as well as for the drinking water needs of the state.
