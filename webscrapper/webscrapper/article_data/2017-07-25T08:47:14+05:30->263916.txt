NEW DELHI: Almost two years ahead of Assembly elections,   has begun a meticulous cadre-building exercise in Telangana. The Grand Old Party, which had been trounced by   Rashtra Samiti ( ) in the newly carved out state in 2014, has started a state-wide exercise of identifying leaders in 119 Assembly constituencies.
 
  In the last elections, K Chandrasekhar Rao-led TRS had cornered 90 of the 119 seats and Congress won a mere 13 and saw a 25% decline in vote share. According to sources, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has entrusted this job to K Raju, incharge of the party’s Scheduled Caste department.
  
  Raju has formed a central team comprising of people who had conducted a similar exercise in the run-up to Uttar Pradesh elections. These include Raju’s team member Shashank Shukla, three persons who were earlier a part of Prashant Kishor’s IPAC team in UP and state’s SC cell leaders.
  
  The Congress has begun the extensive exercise with appointing coordinators in each of 119 Assembly segments. The coordinators have been asked to work out caste maths of each constituency and identify a “probable leader” pool.
  
  After this, leaders identified would be given tasks over the next 18 months to see how they fare in organisational skills and mass movements. A report would be prepared on their performance which would help in creating a resource bank for the party.
  
  Raju told ET, “The party would choose its candidates for the next election from this resource pool. Those who are not chosen as official candidates would be given other organisational responsibilities.” The party would initiate this exercise in batches of 31 Assembly constituencies.
