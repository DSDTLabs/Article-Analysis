NAGPUR: An outstanding all-round performance by   (114 not out and 4 wickets) guided   to an upset 84-run win over defending champions   (DACSA) to clinch the title of the Sharad Bhake Memorial Winter U-13 cricket tournament which concluded at the Vidya Vihar ground here on Sunday.

 Opting to bat, City Gymkhana piled up 234 for four in 50 overs. Mallewar cracked an unbeaten 114 off 109 balls which included 21 boundaries and one six. Kunal Hukre (41, 79b, 2x4, 1x6) provided Danish vital support. Towards the end of the innings, Hardik Nakhate and Anshpal Singh contributed 21 runs each to boost the total.
 
 Pratham Maheshwari, Siddhesh Kantode and Aryan Hedaoo took one wicket each.
 
 Chasing a stiff target, DACSA lost their wickets at regular intervals and were bundled out for 150 in 32 overs. Centurion Mallewar ripped through the DACSA batting line-up and claimed four wickets. Utkarsh Kale got a couple. Only Shaurya Kshetrapal (30), Prabhvijay Lamba (27) and Siddhesh Kantode (24) offered resistance for DACSA. All three batsmen - Shaurya Kshetrapal, Prabhvijay Lamba and Siddhesh Kantode - got starts but they could not convert them which cost their team dearly.
 
 Man-of-the-match award was bagged by Danish Mallewar for his excellent all-round performance.
 
 Former VCA Ranji Trophy selection committee chairman Shrirang Abhyankar was the chief guest of the prize distribution function. Secretary of Nagpur University Co-operative Housing Society Satish Udhoji, Anant Bhave, Sanjay Kali, Gundu Joshi and Milind Pendharkar were present on the occasion.
