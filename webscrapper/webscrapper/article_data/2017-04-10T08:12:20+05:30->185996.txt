HYDERABAD: The Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) has hit yet another roadblock. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) and   (GHMC) are at loggerheads over   for the prestigious project. 

 HMWS&SB officials claim they were ready to shift water/sewer lines at various places in the city, but were not able to execute the plan as the GHMC was yet to complete   in certain areas. 
 
 Based on details of the SRDP given by the GHMC, the HMWS&SB has invited tenders to take up works like shifting water and sewer lines shifting. However, the water board officials were facing problems in certain areas for not finalising alignment of the road. 
 
 For instance, in Gachibowli, the GHMC authorities had asked the water board to shift a 600 mm diameter water pipeline towards Inorbit Mall. "The water board is ready to shift the water lines, but we are yet to get communication from GHMC on the final alignment. On the other hand, an inordinate delay is occurring in shifting water lines due to traffic police's restrictions," HMWS&SB O&M Division-XV (Gachibowli) general manager   told TOI. 
 
 Similarly, due to delay in finalising alignment, works pertaining to shifting two water lines along the flyover at Kamineni junction in LB Nagar were getting delayed. 
 
 At Ayyappa Society Junction in Jubilee Hills, a 900 mm diameter sewer trunk line was found while earth excavation work was taken up by the Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) recently.
