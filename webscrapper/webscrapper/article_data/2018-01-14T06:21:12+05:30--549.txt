HYDERABAD: The victim of a kite flying accident that took place in the city a few years back is now looking for funds in order to procure an artificial limb that would enable him to continue his education. 17-year-old Eshwar was ten when he tripped and fell on an electric transformer while he was in pursuit of a kite, during the Sankranti festival.

 "Eshwar is a bright boy who is currently pursuing   from Srimedhavi junior College in  . He is currently raising funds to procure a new and advanced German prosthesis, the total cost of which has been pegged at 1.5 lakh. This artificial limb will help him carry out his daily chores and more importantly help him properly take part in practical exams in Physics and Chemistry," said  , which is spearheading the crowdfunding campaign.
 
 Estimates also suggest that in state-run hospitals in the city alone, at least one out of three burn victims is in the age group of 10 to 15 years. Doctors point out how in addition to cuts caused through the use of Chinese manja, even accidents involving injuries on limbs, neck, eyes and even burns due to falling on electric lines are common during Sankranti

People using it are at risk of cuts and lacerations and there have been many recent incidents in the city where people flying kites and those in the vicinity reported deep cuts ," said Hari Kishan Booguru, consultant physician at   in Hyderguda.
