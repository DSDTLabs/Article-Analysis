 Fire Department personnel attended at least four calls on January 15 and rescued three birds by late evening. While this number is less than last year, the banned thread kept killing and injuring birds. An officer from the fire brigade said that more birds will suffer injuries in the upcoming week, as nylon thread will remain entangled on trees for long.
 
 “In 2016, six birds were rescued on January 15. We rescued three birds on Sunday. Many social organisations and   are also on a rescue mission this year,” S P Gaikwad, a senior fire station officer, said.
 
 According to the fire department data, 34 birds were rescued in January 2015 and 22 in January 2016. By Sunday, the number of birds rescued this year is 10, which is remarkably low.
