HYDERABAD: The traditional system of disseminating information using a ‘dappu’ (a hand drum) in villages is now being used by  ,   and   to fight child kidnapping rumours floating on WhatsApp and other forms of social media. The campaign against rumours and fake news on   started 25 days ago has intensified following the four deaths related to mob lynching.
 
 
 Gadwal superintendent of police Rema Rajeswari said “Using the age-old ‘tom-tom’, we are going to villages and tribal hamlets of Jogulamba Gadwal and Wanaparthy districts to slay social media rumours, which are leading to mass hysteria and mob lynching. In the tom-tom, a villager, who is assigned to disseminate information traditionally, will go around playing the drum and informing people.”
 
 Police were also conducting meets with village sarpanches as well as adding them in WhatsApp groups. “In the wake of the attack on cross-dressers in Hyderabad, we are cautioning them as during local festivals they depend on a large-scale from the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, especially Kurnool,” Rema Rajeswari added. Vikarabad superintendent of police T Annapurna told TOI, “We are using tom-tom too. We have been conducting meetings with village elders and youth against fake news. We have intensified patrolling. Action will be initiated against group admins and those who share rumours under the IT Act.”
