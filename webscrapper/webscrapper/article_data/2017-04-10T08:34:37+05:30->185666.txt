NEW DELHI: RSS chief   on Sunday supported a countrywide ban on cow slaughter and more effective measures for its compliance even as he strongly denounced vigilantism and lawlessness in the name of cow protection.

 “Our wish is that there should be a law against cow slaughter across India,” Bhagwat said while speaking at an event to observe the birth anniversary of Lord   here.
 
 However, he said nothing should be done that hurt the beliefs of some people. “There should be no violence. It only defames efforts of cow protectors.
 
 The work of cow conservation should be carried out while completely obeying the law and the Constitution,” Bhagwat said. He added that cow slaughter was a vice and must come to an end but added, “It has to be done through legal means without hurting any individual.”
 
 Bhagwat’s remarks come at a time when the saffron outfit has launched a countrywide campaign to protect cows. 
 
 They also come in the wake of alleged vigilantism, like the recent   incident where a man was lynched by a mob.
 
  recently announced severe punishment for cow slaughter and several other states have also done so. “Many states where RSS functionaries have been in power have enacted such a law,” Bhagwat said and expressed confidence that other governments would follow suit by dealing with “local complexities”.
