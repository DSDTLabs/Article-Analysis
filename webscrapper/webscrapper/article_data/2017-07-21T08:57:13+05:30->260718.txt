AHMEDABAD: Anandnagar police arrested three persons whom multiple mobile recharge distributors in Ahmedabad have accused of cheating and breach of trust to the tune of Rs 70 lakh.

 Anandnagar police said Pratik Thakkar, a resident of  , owns a mobile recharge shop near   Crossroads. His brother Chintan met Vishal Modi, a resident of New Ranip, two and a half years ago through business associates. Modi told the Thakkar brothers that they could be super distributors of mobile service providers and buy usage balance in bulk and re-distribute it to retailers.
 
 The brothers agreed and had started dealing with M-Plus Service Zone, Modi’s firm based at Titanium Square, Anandnagar Road. The partnership went well for 11 months. In early July, the brothers paid Rs 26 lakh for recharge credits but could not use the balance. Despite several attempts, Modi, along with his men   and Dikshit Prajapati, failed to address the issue.
 
 “The brothers then learned that Modi had locked his office on July 7 and gone incommunicado,” said an Anandnagar police official. “The brothers then registered a complaint for cheating of Rs 24 lakh against five persons including Modi. Other distributors have also accused them of cheating,” said the police official.
 
 A team led by sub-inspector   nabbed the trio and are investigating the case.
