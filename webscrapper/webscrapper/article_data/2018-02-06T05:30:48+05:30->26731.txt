AGRA: The decision of the UP government to start the   with a dance drama based on the life of Lord Ram has sparked off a controversy, with Opposition parties accusing the Yogi Adityanath government of pursuing its religious agenda of “saffronisation”. The Mahotsav, an annual 10-day event, which takes place at Shilpgram, will be inaugurated on February 18 by the UP chief minister. The festival has always had Mughal overtones and this is the first time that an event based on Hindu mythology will kick it off. 
 
  A senior   leader wondered if it was a “Taj Mahotsav or a Ram Mahotsav”. Another SP leader, Vipul Purohit, said that the move was unprecedented and smacked of the BJP’s political and religious opportunism. "It’s part of the BJP’s saffronisation agenda," he said. The closing ceremony of the festival on February 27 will be presided over by UP governor  .
  
  Talking to TOI, deputy director of tourism, Dinesh Kumar, who had made the announcement about the dance drama, said, “The objections and allegations are baseless. There is no saffron agenda behind the move. The festival’s theme was decided by a committee after receiving nearly 200 ideas from the city’s residents.” The dance-drama will be organized by the Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra.
  
  State cabinet minister and UP government spokesperson Siddharta Nath Singh said, “Taj Mahotsav doesn’t mean that everything connected with it needs to have overtones of the Mughal era. Why should anyone have problems with a dance and drama on Lord Ram.” BJP’s city president from Agra, Vijay Shivhare, said that the Opposition was unnecessarily making the issue political. “What could be a better way to start a programme than by taking the name of Lord Ram,” he said.
  
  The Taj Mahotsav will include performances by singer Bhoomi Trivedi and Qawwali singer Aslam Sabri. A mushaira and a kavi sammelan will also be held, along with performances by singers Vipin Sachdeva, Aditya Narayan,  , Palak Muchhal and Palash Muchhal.
