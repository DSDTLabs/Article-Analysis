AMBALA: While whole of top leadership was present for the party’s rally at Ambala on the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal water issue, family members of   and ex-CM Om Prakash Chautala’s elder son, Ajay, were conspicuous by their absence.

 Nobody from jailed Ajay Chautala’s family, including his wife and Dabawali MLA Naina Singh Chautala and his son and Hisar MP Dushyant Chautala, was present here on Thursday. Even Ajay’s younger son Digvijay Singh Chautala, who is the national president of party’s student wing Indian National Student Organization (INSO), was also absent.
 
 Many INLD workers, who attended the party rally at the vegetable market in Ambala before marching towards Punjab border, discussed remarked on their absence. Ajay is at present serving his 10-year jail sentence after being convicted, along with his father, in teacher recruitment scam in Haryana. His wife and both sons are active in state politics and had been leading the party in absence of their father and grandfather.
 
 Ajay’s younger brother Abhay Chautala led the Thursday event. Abhay Chautala’s younger son Arjun also marched with him and courted arrest with top INLD leaders at the Punjab border.
 
 When asked about absence of Ajay Chautala’s family members, INLD state president Ashok Arora said that Dushyant and Digvijay could not attend the rally because both were in the US. “There is no difference of opinion on the issue between party leaders. Dushyant even visited many villages with us inviting the party workers for the Ambala congregation. It is just a coincidence that he had to go to the US due to some prior appointment,” Arora said.
 
 Naina Chautala said she had organized ‘Akhand Path’ at her residence in Delhi from February 22 to 24 on account of upcoming family functions and because of that she could not move out of the house. She also denied any reports of any conflict and said she could not attend the INLD event only because of the unavoidable family engagement.
