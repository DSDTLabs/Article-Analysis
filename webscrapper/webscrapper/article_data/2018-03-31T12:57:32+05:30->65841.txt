Actor   said she is 'proud' of having 'survived' wild parties at   veteran Carrie Fisher's house. 

  
  
 The 43-year-old actor said she used to love visiting the late actor's house. "I loved going to her house. It was like a hacienda type of like beautiful home off of Coldwater Canyon, very Los Angeles. She just had a very open home. I'd been there for parties, her office in the daytime. It was classic,  , California - sunshine, orange groves and creativity," Barrymore said. 
 
 "I'm proud to say I came and went because I feel like a lot of people stayed. I remember Garry Shandling being weird in the driveway. And I was like, 'I'm so glad I'm going home! I'm so glad I'm surviving these kind of nights,'" she added. The actor also recalled one of her wild nights out with Courtney Love in the 1990s. 
 
 "Courtney and I were at the backstage of a Seattle club. We'd just come from seeing Green Day. We were going to see Beck play at coffee house and the bouncer said, 'I'm sorry, you can't come in, you don't have a backstage pass'," she said. 
 
 "Courtney looked at him and goes, 'My face is a backstage pass'. And then swept him aside and just walked in and I was still left there standing," Barrymore added.
