MUMBAI: In what could be a first for   (BMC) polls, the   (SEC) is examining the possibility of having over a dozen Income Tax Officers (ITO) monitor the spend of candidates contesting the civic polls due in February . The dates for elections to the country's richest civic body , whose annual budget is Rs 37,000 crore, are expected to be announced anytime now. Every candidate is allowed to spend up to Rs 5 lakh, which excludes party expenses. It is now learnt that the SEC is examining the possibility of having up to 20 ITOs across the city's 24 administrative wards who will monitor expenditure by candidates. These ITOs will be supervised by an officer of the rank of Income Tax commissioner.

 J S Saharia, state election commissioner, confirmed to TOI that they are examining having ITOs but said it was too early to give out any details. A senior official involved in the election process, who did not wish to be named, said, “Candidates who are contesting need to open a dedicated bank account from where they are expected to spend. These ITOs would be like independent observers who would monitor spending and check whether candidates are breaching the limit set.“
 
 An examination of candidates' accounts is usually done by the Income Tax department after the elections but this time poll expenditure will be studied during the campaign itself.
 
 According to civic sources, the heightened vigilance over circulation of unaccounted money postdemonetization could be the reason behind the SEC's move to have ITOs monitoring the cash flow in the polls. NGOs like   welcomed the move.  , project director of Praja, said, “It's good if such a move materializes because it means a qualified person would be put in charge of checking expenditure. Many times, issues like these come to light very late. But exactly how beneficial the move will be, only time will tell.“
