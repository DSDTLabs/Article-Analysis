KOCHI: Quenching thirst with a glass of   in the humid summer heat seems to be a lost musing for   on   have stopped serving beer and wine following the Supreme Court order banning all   within 500 metres of national and   across the country. The SC move caused a severe blow to tourists and local residents, as well as to the beer and wine parlour stakeholders alike.

 “Our clientele is purely based around beverages since our establishment had been catering to such consumers from the very start. The banning of hard liquor last year itself had been a severe blow from which we are still recovering. The new order is like putting a nail to the coffin from which we may not recover at all,“ said the general manager of a four star hotel on the MG Road stretch.
 
 He added that conference bookings which had a cocktail dinner customized for the cli ents will also be affected. Many of the restaurants that had an attached beer and wine parlour from which the major chunk of the income came from remained closed over the weekend after the order.
 
 “A chilled beer in summer is the most sought after drink. If it cannot be served in and around the busiest roads of the city, how can we expect people to come over for just lunch or dinner, that too in the extremely hot weather?“ owner of a be er and wine parlour asked. Hoteliers said domestic sales dropped immediately following the order but tourists' inflow can only be assessed after a significant period of time.
 
 “Tourists plan their trips beforehand and thus it will take a bit of time to know how adversely this particular order will affect the tourist inflow.However, domestic food sales have been hit,“ said James KC, general manager of Grand Hotel.
