On Wednesday, Mirror reported (May 9) how   had gone the extra mile for her “Dum Maro Dum“ act in the dance reality show, Nach Baliye, which she is judging.
 Now, we have learnt that the actress was quite miffed after she was kept waiting for hours to film her tribute to Zeenat Aman despite having informed the team well in advance that she had to leave early to keep another commitment. A little after 10pm, she posted a cryptic tweet “I hate it when people refuse to respect other people's time and commitments. It's the one single thing that switches me off. Like fully.“
  
  
  
  A source from the sets reveals that Sona had wanted to leave by 8.30 pm but was made to wait till 11 pm to shoot her dance which was the last performance of the day.
  
  
 
  
  “Since the theme was Bollywood, all the couples had a lot of props so setting up the shots took time. Also, this was the first time on the show that the couples had to coordinate their movements with background dancers and that added to the delay. Lunch break which is usually not more than 45 minutes went on for two hours. Sonakshi's own act choreographed by Salman Yusuff Khan, required some rehearsals and was eventually canned around 11.30pm.
  
  “She was miffed but couldn't do much because even her entry and exit shots hadn't been shot, so she was forced to stay on,“ adds the source. Hare Krishna, Hare Ram!
