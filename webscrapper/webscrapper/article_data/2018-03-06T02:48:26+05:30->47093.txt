They included -   owners   and Kalindi Shah (sisters),   directors Vishal and   (brothers), their father Pravin, employee Arun Gupta, and technical head  , having power of attorney. Jigar committed suicide at Marine Drive in Mumbai on February 27. 
 
 While praying for rejection of their bail plea, the ACB iterated its accusations against the petitioners, charging them with rigging the tender process and cheating VIDC.
