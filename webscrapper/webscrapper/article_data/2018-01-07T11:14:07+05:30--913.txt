Jaipur: The Jaipur traffic police have conducted the study of the   to enquire into reasons behind frequent traffic mishaps.

 “We have recommended extending dividers, repairing street lights and removing encroachments,” said an official. According to sources, the Jaipur traffic police have also roped in other agencies such as the   (JDA) and PWD to avert traffic accidents.
 
 Police also said that new CCTVs may be installed in these areas to keep a tab on traffic offenders. The traffic police have already installed speed detector cameras to keep a watch on daredevils on JLN Marg.
 
 Residents and shopkeeper, however, voiced their concerns about lax enforcement of traffic laws. “There are traffic lights already, but nobody obeys. At least, the police could deploy some wardens here to control the traffic,” said   of Kumbha Marg.
 
 Ganesh Dhadhich, a student at a nearby engineering college, said that many people don’t cross the road here. “There is absolutely no traffic management, there is a divider which is badly constructed and there are iron spikes which can prove fatal someday,” he said.
