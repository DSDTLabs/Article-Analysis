AMARAVATI: Taking light of protests for special category status (SCS), the   Party (TDPP) has decided to fight to get   for the   announced by the Centre. 

  The TDPP meeting, held here on Monday in the presence of party supremo and chief minister  , discussed the strategy to be adopted by the party in the budget session, which commences on Tuesday. The CM asked party MPs, including Union science and technology minister YS Chowdary, to raise the issue of granting legal status to the special package in both the houses of parliament. The meeting, which lasted for about two hours, discussed the resignation threat issued by YSRCP MPs.
 
 Sources said the MPs are believed to have expressed dissatisfaction at the Centre for delaying the legal sanction to the special package. "The issue of SCS would not have cropped up had the Centre cleared the legal sanction to the package soon after its announcement. The delay is putting the party in a spot," a senior MP said. Another MP urged the CM not to give up fight for getting a separate  . "The issue of railway zone at Visakhapatnam could pose bigger trouble for the party than SCS. The demand has the support of all the sections and any delay in getting the zone may dent party's image," he said.
