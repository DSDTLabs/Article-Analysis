Ludhiana: Taking action against the violations in the marriage palaces, the officials of Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (Glada) have sealed three marriage palaces on Tuesday. The officials have sealed Stallone Manor on Pakhowal Road, Mohini Palace Sahnewal and Sangam Palace in Meharban.

 The owners of these marriage palaces did not fulfill the required norms and did not get these places regularised under policy. The department had served notices to the owners of these palaces for not fulfilling the norms. The estate officer (regulatory) Harpreet Sekhon said these palaces did not get building plan approval from the district town planning department and they also lacked parking facility and fire NOC. He said they gave enough time to these owners but when they did not respond to the notices, the department sealed the premises.
 
 Earlier, Glada had sealed three more palaces this month.
