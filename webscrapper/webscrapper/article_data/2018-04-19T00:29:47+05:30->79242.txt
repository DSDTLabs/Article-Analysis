MUMBAI: Jewellers across the city reported moderate sales of gold at   on Wednesday. Low-value coins and ornaments ranging from 1 gm to 5 gm fared well while high-value inventory remained largely unsold. 

 "The rate of gold has spiralled beyond Rs 32,000 per 10 gm in the last two days, dampening consumer sentiment," the manager of a suburban store headquartered in Opera House said. "A single gram costs Rs 3,100 where two days before it was less than Rs 3,000. We have not received the expected footfalls."
 
 Heavy ornaments like bangles, necklaces and mangalsutra scarcely found buyers, except at a few shops like Waman Hari Pethe in Dadar, where manager Pradeep Madiye was pleased.
 
 Large showrooms like PNG and Kalyan Jewellers were pleasantly surprised to see higher footfalls, right from the morning hours. They expected business to rise by 10%-25% over Akshay Tritiya 2017.
 
 Mid-level goldsmiths like Harsh Jewellers in  , and   and Pendurkar, both in Dadar, said low-cost items fared well. Vikram Vakadkar sold 1 gm, 3 gm and 5 gm ornaments while heavy items weighing 20 gm to 30 gm remained on the shelves. Pravin Pendurkar said the weight of most items sold was in single digits.
 
 A dejected Kiran Jain of Riddhi Silver nearby said, "Gold always fares better on mahurat days. My silver store has sold only two items through the day. The bohni (inaugural sale) happened at 6 pm, and each purchase was worth merely Rs 1,000 or so. Since two years we are finding it difficult to keep our head above water."
 
 "Even those who have money are not spending. One customer who intended to buy a 5 gm coin finally purchased only 1 gm. Exams have ended two days ago so people are budgeting for vacation expenses as well," said Rakesh Porwal who owns two stores,   and My Gold Point, in IC Colony, Borivli.
