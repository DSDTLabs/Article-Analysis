In 2010, when the   passed the   (Cumta) Bill, it was expected to maximise the potential of the city's  . A single decision making authority was proposed to  , find well-rounded solutions and bridge gaps in transport and administration.

 But after seven years, Cumta is yet to take shape. Notwithstanding the fact that it is yet to be notified by the state government, Cumta could have slipped into red tape oblivion if not for the interest shown by a few bureaucrats to keep it alive in the administration's memory , said sources.
 
 “It has been more than a year since the last Cumta working group met at Ripon Buildings,“ a corporation official said.
 
 The   is a majority stakeholder in the working group for non-motorised transport, one of the two such groups for Cumta. The other working group is the one on multi-modal integration that covers metrorail and MTC.
 
 In the last seven years, there have been more than a dozen of these working group meetings. “The continuity of these meetings are affected by a number of reasons, especially the frequent changes in bureaucracy,“ a transport consultant who has worked with the corporation said.
 
 A source who has been a part of Cumta sessions with corporation staff say the platform is effective. Cumta is a reason why these government officials come together and talk. The corporation's footpath widening project executed on 26 bus route roads in 2014 was a result of discussions during one such session, the source said.
 
 But integration platforms such as Cumta are seldom given its due respect by government agencies, a former corporation official said.Despite the involvement of multiple, influential gover nment departments, not even the transport department which is the nodal agency for Cumta, has taken the initiative to implement it. “There is no burning desire among the political class or the officialdom to make this happen. Cumta is in the back of the line of a million different things that worry them,“ the source added.
