HASSAN: Reiterating his stance on Hinduism, multilingual actor   on Thursday said, “I am not against Hinduism, nor am I a supporter of the terrorist organistion  , as claimed by those opposing.”

 Rai, who was in Hassan, said, “Everyone who is in politics are thieves. But, some of them are big thieves, and few others are smaller ones.”
 
 Clarifying that his intentions were non-political, Rai added, “I am just trying to find solutions by asking questions.”
 
 Exhorting one and all to cultivate an inquisitive mindset, Rai said that the murder of journalist Gauri Lankesh had   him deeply disturbed. “It was not a murder, but an attempt to stop those who were raising important questions,” the actor said.
 
 Reacting to allegations that he was touring Karnataka because he had no work in films, Rai said, “I am actually very busy. Dubbing for some of my films is pending. Around three to four films are ready to go for shooting. I have done more than 300 films. I am not asking people to vote for any single party. My appeal to them is to think and vote.”
 
 Rai said that he was raising questions about ideology, and false promises made by the leaders. “All ideologies, the Right and Left have failed. We need a new ideology today. The BJP’s ideology is dictated by the RSS, and that is why I am opposing it. Don’t mix religion with politics. I am not against any religion,” said Rai, asking his opponents not to rake up personal issues.
 
 Rai said that thinking about the Cauvery dispute brought tears to his eyes. “I am not willing to talk about it for just two minutes. Many innocent people have committed suicide, vehicles have been burnt, and buildings destroyed. But no leader has been hurt in the violence. This is the real issue,” he said.
 
 The actor refused to comment on Mysuru MP Pratap Simha’s tweets about his name. “Rajkumar’s original name was Muttu Raj. My name is Prakash Rai, and it became Prakash Raj after I entered the film industry,” Rai said.
