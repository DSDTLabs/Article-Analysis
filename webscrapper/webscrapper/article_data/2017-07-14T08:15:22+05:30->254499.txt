VIJAYAWADA: Unable to bear the   and harassment by a group of young boys, a 14-year-old schoolgirl committed suicide at   near Auto Nagar in the city on Wednesday night.

 The girl, a class 9 student in a government high school, was being harassed for the past one year while on her way to the school. The accused, a 16-year-old boy, works at a meat shop located on the way to the girl’s school. He would hang out with his friends under a tree near the shop and pass lewd comments when she passed through the area.
 
 The victim’s younger sister alleged that the boy had even resorted to verbal abuse. Despite undergoing the daily trauma, the victim did not complain to her parents. When the sister notified the parents later, they did not take the child very seriously.
 
 On Wednesday evening, when the girl once again passed by the shop, the accused started teasing her and abusing her using filthy language. The girl got enraged and threatened to beat the boy with her slipper. Instead of backing down, the boy proceeded to insult her and even spat on her face.
 
 The girl returned home in tears. Later, when her family members were away, she hanged herself.
 
 Her father, an electrician, did not know anything about his daughter’s trauma until after the tragedy. Initially, the parents were reluctant to lodge a complain, but they did so when local YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) leader S K Bhasha persuaded them to take action.
 
 With tension gripping the area as the news spread, more political parties joined the melee. Local TDP leaders lashed out at YSRC leaders accusing them of trying to gain political mileage out of the issue. Both groups argued with each other before the police intervened.
 
 The police shifted the girl’s body for post-mortem at a government hospital. A case was booked against the minor boy for harassment and abetment to suicide under section 306 of the Indian Penal Code.
