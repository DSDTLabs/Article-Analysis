Chennai: A day after a complaint was lodged against actor and director Manobala for taking personal digs at AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala and chief minister O Panneerselvam, he filed a counter complaint claiming that some miscreant has posted the message from his mobile phone without his knowledge.

 On Wednesday, AIADMK partyman Cini Saravanan registered a complaint with the cyber crime branch after the actor’s WhatsApp message indirectly targeted the two leaders. Saravanan claimed that such messages spoiled the leaders’ reputation and were derogatory. He demanded action against Manobala.
 
 On Thursday morning, Manobala lodged a complaint at the police commissioner’s office claiming that he got to know of the message only after the news appeared in sections of the media. He said he had kept his mobile phone outside when he went for a film shoot. “Some miscreants, with an intention to create trouble for me, could have sent the message from my mobile,” he said in the complaint.
 
 Manobala said he had been with the AIADMK for the past 15 years. The miscreant who grew jealous about his growth in the party could have sent the message, he said and demanded action against the culprit.
