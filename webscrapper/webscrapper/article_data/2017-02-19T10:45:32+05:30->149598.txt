MUMBAI: NCP president   on Saturday said that in the event   withdraws support to the Devendra Fadnavis-government, his party NCP will not support either of them for formation of the government.

 “I am prepared to give it in writing to the governor. Shiv Sena president   too should write to the governor, saying that after the civic and zilla parishad polls, Sena will not support the BJP government,“ said Pawar.
 
 Pawar was replying to Uddhav's recent statement that the NCP chief will not hesitate to bail out the BJP government if Sena withdraws support. When BJP failed to secure a clear majority in 2014, the NCP had extended outside support for formation of the government.
 
 “At that time, I was of the view that it will be unwise to impose fresh elections but now there is a complete change in the political situation. Owing to the public spat between BJP and Shiv Sena, Maharashtra is heading towards mid-term polls. NCP is prepared to contest the elections,“ Pawar said.
 
 He also took a dig at the larger-than-life hoardings of Fadnavis and PM Modi in the city .
