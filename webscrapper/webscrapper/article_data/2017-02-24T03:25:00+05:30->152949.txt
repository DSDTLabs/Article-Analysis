Nagpur: 41-year-old Abha Pande, who has been three times sitting corporator, has won this time too, but without a party ticket. She is probably the only independent candidate who has managed to defeat party candidates in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) polls. “Those who have public support don’t need a party backup,” were her first words after emerging as a winner on Thursday. Pande, who defeated Shiv Sena’s candidate Alka Dalal, “was happy to be free from party pressure”.  This is the first time that Pande, who was in fray from ward no 21, didn’t seek a party ticket from Congress. “When one is linked with a party, it creates a hurdle in many ways. Parties sometimes pressurise not to raise certain issues. Now, I can work as per my agenda and ideologies,” she said. Pande further claimed that many bigwigs had created conspiracies to defame her. “All these years, I kept serving the people and have gained their trust. This is the main reason why despite all such attempts, I won,” said Pande. “Ultimately, it is the public image that matters the most,” she added. Though an old-time Congress leader, she had developed differences with the party and had tried to get a ticket from BJP. When refused from there too, she formed a panel of four and jumped into fray as an independent. Other members of her panel were independent corporator Ravindra Dolas, sitting BJP corporator Sulochana Kowe and ex-corporator Vilas Parate. Pande had earlier contested state assembly polls in 2014 as an independent candidate against Anees Ahmed from Congress but had fared poorly. Since then, she kept aloof from the party. She also has a strong education background with a postgraduate degree from Manav Bharti University. In her affidavit, Pande had declared her total financial assets over Rs 21 lakhs.
