NASHIK: The Nashik Inc has drawn up a proposal for   to start early   from here, preferably before 7am. 

 Air Deccan has already announced to launch services from Nashik to Mumbai and Pune from September under the regional connectivity scheme.
 
 The proposal will be submitted to the private airlines at a meeting scheduled here next week.
 
 “A meeting will take place between Air Deccan and the industrialists to discuss the timing of flights and the fare. The views of the industries will be taken into consideration to know what time the flights can be scheduled for Mumbai and Pune,” said Nashik MP Hemant Godse.
 
 As per the regional connectivity scheme, fare for a one-hour journey of approximately 500km on a fixed wing aircraft is Rs 2,500. But, the aerial distance between Nashik and Mumbai is only 136km, which can be covered in half-an-hour. So, the airfare for Mumbai should be around Rs 1,600 per head. The aerial distance between Nashik and Pune is 159km.
 
 Industrialists are stressing on the need for early morning flights.  , chairman of the   (India), Nashik centre, said, “It will help the local air travellers and industrialists if flights are scheduled before 7am as most people will be able to catch the morning flights for other destinations like Delhi, Hyderabad and Bangalore. This will also increase the demand for flights.”
 
 The air fare is not an issue for industrialists as it is a part of the government policy and regional connectivity scheme.
