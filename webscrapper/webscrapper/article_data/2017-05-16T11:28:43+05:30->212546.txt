HYDERABAD: Pressure is mounting on chief minister   to rejig his cabinet ahead of the state formation day on June 2.

 With the TRS government almost completing three years in power, a large number of senior leaders who did not `benefit' due to the formation of the state are insisting on expanding the cabinet.
 
 According to sources, the CM too is not averse to effect a few changes in the cabinet, but wants time to figure out asuitable team that will stay put till the Assembly elections in 2019. 
 
 TRS government has not had a single woman in its cabinet till date, a fact that has given the opposition much needed ammunition to hit the KCR regime. The proposed reshuffle will have to rectify that anomaly by inducting one or more woman ministers into the cabinet.
 
 The names of Kova Laxmi, Konda Sureka and deputy speaker   are under consideration. Sources said that four MLAs were promised ministerial berths and that all of them have now stepped up their efforts.  , who was defected from the TDP , is one among them. After AP CM inducted four YSRCP MLAs into his cabinet, the demand for a ministerial berth for Dayakar Rao has gained momentum. 
 
 Chief whip   and chairman of the legislative council Swamy Goud are also contending for a cabinet berth. Those who lost parliamentary secretary posts after the court struck down the appointments are also waiting for an elevation. They include D Vinaya Bhaskar, Jalagam Venkata Rao, V Srinivas Goud, Kova Laxmi and Gadari Kishore.
 
 “KCR has assured suitable posts for them after they lost the parliamentary secretary post.At least two of them will be considered for the cabinet,“ a close aide of the CM said. 
 
 KCR wants to give BC welfare ministry to Eatela Rajender. Joga Ramana Rao will be given civil supplies ministry . As the total number of ministers in the cabinet has already touched the upper limit of 18, KCR is likely to drop a couple of ministers to accommodate new faces.
