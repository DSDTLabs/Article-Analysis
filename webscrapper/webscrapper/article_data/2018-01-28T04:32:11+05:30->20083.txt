MUMBAI: A man sustained burn injuries after a fire broke out at   in Goregaon (east) around 8am on Saturday. The injured, who suffered 3% burns, was shifted to a nearby   before the fire brigade officials arrived. His condition is stable. 

 Officials stated that the fire was confined to 25 galas most of them ground-plusone or ground-plus-mezzanine floor structures. They said that the fire spread quickly due to the presence of electric wirings, plastic material, scrap and household materials in the galas. 
 
 It took almost five hours for the fire brigade to extinguish the blaze with the help of eight fire engines. Officials stated that the victim, Sanjay Ray, was rushed to hospital by locals. 
 
 Fire brigade officials have asked the local BMC ward office, licence inspector and the police to check if there were any illegal alterations or violations of rules in the gutted structure.
