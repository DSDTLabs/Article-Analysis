ALWAR: Three bodies including a daughter, mother and a man were found   at Rajkhera village in   district of the state creating sensation in the area.

 Police though have termed it as a suicide but they have also not ruled out the possibility of murder.
 
 Police said that the man was in a relationship with married woman and the mother of woman too had given her nod to their relationship.
 
 The deceased were identified as Mukesh (30) who was in a relationship with the married woman identified as   (22) and Sunita (48), Poonam’s Poonam.
 
 Locals informed the police about spotting of three bodies hanging on a tree. “Prima facie it is a case of suicide. Still we are  ,” said a senior officer.
 
 However, police have not ruled out the possibility of foul play. “It was found that the deceased Mukesh was in love with the woman identified as Poonam.
 
 Despite knowing that Poonam was married, the accused took her to Delhi along with her mother Sunita. This perhaps triggered a confrontation in Poonam’s in-laws’ family and her maternal family.”
 
 Police said that there is a possibility that the three committed suicide due to fear of public disgrace. “Postmortem report will clear the reasons behind the death of three persons,” said an officer.
