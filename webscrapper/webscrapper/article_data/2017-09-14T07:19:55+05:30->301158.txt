KOLKATA: The CPM state unit on Wednesday recommended the expulsion of its Rajya Sabha MP   from the party on disciplinary grounds. The decision came a day after the MP targeted the party's politburo member and Lok Sabha MP Md Selim for “heading a coterie“ within the party to discredit him.

 Bandyopadhyay's threemonth suspension following allegations about his lifestyle, misuse of party post and leaking confidential party reports to the media ended on September 2. Selim, against whom he hit out on Tuesday , incidentally headed a threemember inquiry commission to probe the charges against him. “I am not authorised to speak on internal affairs of the party, least on purported disciplinary actions,“ Selim said.
 
 A visibly emotional Bandyopadhyay told reporters, “If you ask me if the decision has pained me or not -it su re did. For 21years, I have breathed and lived for CPM. The umbilical cord has been severed today . But this is a war. It pains me now, but I will have o bear that. My fight is not against the party . It is against a coterie of leaders. Someone has to bell the cat.“ Bandyopadhyay's tenure in the   will end in April 2020. In case of an expulsion, he will be a “free' lawmaker“ who won't be bound by CPM party whips. As he is a member of Parliament, the decision of the CPM state secretariat will have to be endorsed by the CPM's central committee, the highest executive body of the party , when it meets on October 14 and 15 in Delhi. A source said the central committee is likely to endorse the expulsion.
 
 The June 2 suspension was the second time in three months that   had reprimanded him.
