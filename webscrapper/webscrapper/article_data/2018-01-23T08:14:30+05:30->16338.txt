Ruhi Singh, actress and Miss Universal Peace And Humanity 2014, was back on the ramp after years, as she participated in the Dream Diamonds   Fashion Week. She was surprised to note how much fashion shows have changed over years. "They have changed for good, they are more professional and organized now," she said and added that she was nervous about walking the ramp after a long time. “It’s been way too long since I was on the ramp as I’m usually busy shooting. Acting is so different from ramp modelling – it actually made me nervous and I wasn’t expecting myself to get nervous since I have done this before. But I was excited, too," she said, adding, "Being a Times of India talent, I am proud to see Delhi Times   as such a successful event. I feel so proud to be here!"

 The Calendar Girls actress said she was disappointed over the controversies surrounding Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Padmaavat. She said, "As a viewer and as part of the creative industry, I always get disappointed when creativity and filmmaking is mixed with politics. I feel that when it comes to expressing yourself, there should be no limits. Art has no restrictions. I’m definitely going to go to watch  , first day and first show."
