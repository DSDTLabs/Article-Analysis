HYDERABAD: Four employees of the education department were arrested by Central Crime Station (CCS) sleuths for allegedly collecting bribes from private schools for upgradation of data from Class VIII to X.

 CCS officials said that Mohammed Mansoor Ali, junior assistant from the   (DEO), Mohammed Abdul Ghani, assistant director DEO, Mancheryal, and former superintendent,   (RJDSE), Hyderabad,  , superintendent of RJDSE, Hyderabad, and G Venu Gopal, junior assistant, DEO, were nabbed for preparing fake documents related to permission to open schools and extension of temporary recognition.
 
 “These officials collected bribes from at least 14 private schools to arrange for the permissions. They also issued fake documents. During the 2017-18 academic year, when these schools sent their eligible students’ list to the DEO office as those who will appear for the examination, the schools got a reply that these 14 schools have no recognition,” assistant commissioner of police (CCS) K   said.
 
 According to the police, when these schools went to the education department along with the ‘fake’ documents, senior education officials realised the fraud.
 
 An enquiry has been ordered since then and the accused were arrested on Monday. They were produced before the ACB court and remanded.
