There are umpteen jokes about the frugality of Amdavadis but when it comes to lifesaving donations, they certainly lead the pack. On October 1, as India marks ‘National Voluntary Blood Donation Day’, 101 people will be felicitated for donating blood more than 100 times. To mark the occasion, 30 of these centurions will donate blood on Sunday.

 Mukesh Patel, city-based international tax consultant and founder chairman of the Ahmedabad Red Cross Centurion Blood Donors’ Club, said that Ahmedabad is the only city in the world with such a record. Sustained campaigns seemed to have infused the trend with fresh blood.
 
 "The movement to create awareness about the cause and motivate people to come forward and donate, started in the 1960s with VG Mavalankar," Patel said. "The trend caught on and we find centurions from diverse fields. Examples include Justice   (century in 1978), Swami Adhyatmananda of   (century in 2005), and the first woman centurion in India, Ketki Shah, (century in 2006)."
 
 The first person with disabilities to become a centurion in India was also an Amdavadi ( , century in 2010).Patel himself holds the record for donating blood in 25 different countries apart from India.
 
 Patel further said that the main reason for the city leading in donations is the high-level of awareness created among people through campaigns such as 25 (blood donations) by 25 (years).
 
 "Amdavadis organize blood donation camps to mark birth or death anniversaries and even during mass marriages," said Patel.
