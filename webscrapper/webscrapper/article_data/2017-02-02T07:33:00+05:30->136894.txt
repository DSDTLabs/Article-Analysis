MUMBAI: The  , which is facing criticism for graft in the BMC, is brandishing the Economic Survey 2016-17 to get back at its erstwhile ally the BJP. 

 The Union finance ministry’s document tabled in Parliament on Tuesday placed the BMC at the apex in terms of transparency and accountability. Shiv Sena leaders used the opportunity to target the BJP, saying that the Sena-ruled BMC was more transparent than civic bodies in states managed by the BJP. Yuva Sena chief   tweeted: “The Economic Survey of the   ranks Mumbai’s BMC best on Transparency. I congratulate Mayor @imsnehalambekar, the Municipal Commissioner Mehta ji and all others key to running the BMC.”
 
 Both parties could not come together on the issue of transparency and parted ways after being together in the BMC for nearly 20 years. 
 
 “We are saying that the BMC is most transparent institution, but the BJP is misleading is people,” said Shiv Sena corporator Yashodhar Phanse. However, the BJP chose to downplay the Economic Survey. “The road and desilting scams are a reality,” said BJP spokesperson Niranjan Shetty.
