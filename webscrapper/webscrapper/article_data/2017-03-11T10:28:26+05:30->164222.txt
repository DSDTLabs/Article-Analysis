 KOLHAPUR: Various progressive organisations in the city will hold a rally in the city on Sunday to protest against increasing incidents of violence against women, female feticide and the recent murder of eminent Ambedkarite writer and thinker Krishna Kirawale.
 
 The   (MANS) and the   have taken initiative for the protest rally which will be held at   at 5pm. 
 
 Rajvaibhav  , organiser of the rally, said, “Maharashtra is going trough a critical phase. The social environment has been polluted over various incidents from the murder of Krishna Kirawale and rape of a dalit woman in Washim district to women feticide in Sangli district. These incidents have damaged the image of a progressive Maharashtra.” 
 
 Kambale further said, “We will gather from all corners of the city and will press for speedy investigation of Kirawale’s murder. Police have suppressed the rape of a dalit woman in Washim. The government should come out with a clarification.” 
 
 Last month, a young girl committed suicide in Kolhapur due to harassment and torture. Women are not safe in the state. The home department is not serious to investigate such incidents, Kambale said.
 
 “We have decided to gather in a peaceful manner. The idea is to create awareness among the citizens about sensitivity and seriousness of these incidents,” he added.
 
 Kirawale was stabbed to death at his residence in   colony in Kolhapur on Friday afternoon. 
 
 Within 24 hours of the murder, police arrested Pritam Ganpat   (30) and his mother Mangal in the case.
 
 Police said Kirawale and Patil, who is a neighbour, allegedly had a dispute over payment for the purchase of a row house.
