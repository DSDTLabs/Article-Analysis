BENGALURU: Muslim leaders in the   are upset that only 15 members from their community have been given tickets in the list of 218 party candidates announced on Sunday.

 
 "I am not happy with the representation the Muslims have been given. We were promised more tickets than what we were given in 2013 (19). On the contrary, the number has been reduced. We will meet AICC president   on Monday and take up the issue," former MP   said on Sunday.
 
 Khan's son Mansoor Ali Khan was an aspirant for the Jayanagar seat, which has a huge chunk of Muslim voters. The ticket, however, has gone to home minister Ramalinga Reddy's daughter Soumya Reddy.
 
 "All ministers' and leaders' sons or daughters have got tickets. Why was my son denied ticket from a constituency where Muslim voters are in big numbers," asked Khan.
