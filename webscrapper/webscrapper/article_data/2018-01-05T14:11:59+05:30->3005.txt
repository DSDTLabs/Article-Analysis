INDORE: Letters written by 900 girls studying at St   High School were submitted before the high court on Thursday where they said that they had to face comments by boys when they took the main road to the school, and hence the alternate gate from readymade garments complex must not be closed.

 The petition by the school through advocate Anand Mohan Mathur was heard on Thursday by Justice PK  , who took on record the letters by students and the layout plan of the readymade garments complex submitted by MP AKVN, and listed the matter for hearing on January 15.
 
 “We also submitted a map of the school and the area which shows that there are two entrances to the school and both of them are public roads. The map submitted by us is dated November 17, 2017 which the latest map of the area,” advocate Abhinav Dhanodkar, appearing on behalf of the petitioners said.
 
 The letters by the students also state on record that the lane from the   main road leading up to the school was not safe for girls and the boys harassed them on the patch, which was why the girls preferred the road passing through the readymade garment’s complex.
 
 The petitioners had previously submitted letters stating that that the students who were using the gate, will have to walk another 2km to reach the school if the rear entrance was closed.
 
 Meanwhile, the town and country planning department’s layout plan was also submitted on record which showed that the lane went through the 98 acres of the electronic and readymade garments complex of AKVN.
 
 The total strength of the school is 2500, of which 900 students use the entrance which passes through the electronics and readymade garments complex.
