CHANDIGARH: For most teachers in Tricity, the best way to crack the   is to stick to a time schedule, study methodically, revise and, most importantly, destress. Talking to The Times of India, most teachers said the feeling of nervousness was there even when they were students, but stress levels were not as high as today. Khamoshi Kakkar, an   at   in Panchkula, said practice tests helped her. “While revising, I would prepare a set of short notes. These were handy for last-minute revisions. Time management is most important,” she said.

 When it came to one-mark questions, Khamoshi left them for the last 10-12 minutes. A coordinator at Innovation Satluj Public School in Panchkula, Alka Dhody, last appeared in the board exams in 1988 and at that time the “ultimate target for most students was to get a first division, which was 60% or more”. “Studious ones usually scored in the 80s and the rarest of rare scored 90 and above. There was competition too, but not to the extent we see today. The word stress was nonexistent in our dictionaries,” she said.
 
 Jatinder K, a history teacher at Guru Nanak Public School in Sector 36, said she would adopt wide-ranging methodologies. “I would meditate and go out of home to destress. I followed a time schedule and studied with all my heart. Remember, healthy home-cooked food is the best to stay active,” she said.
 
 When  , a head of department at Satluj Public School in Panchkula, sat for her first board exams in 2003, the trend of coaching was emerging in the city. “We used to meet students from different schools. Healthy discussions helped sharpen and enhance our knowledge, but all this caused peer pressure too,” she said. “But I can say from my experience is that appearing for board exams is no  . The only way to sail through is by staying relaxed and confident.”
