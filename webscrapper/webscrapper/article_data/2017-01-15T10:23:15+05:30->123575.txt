PATNA: Almost all the boats plying from Gandhi Ghat in Patna to the Ganga diara on Saturday afternoon were overloaded and there was no one from the district administration to prevent the boatmen from violating the rules. Policemen and officials of Bihar   (BSTDC), who were busy with the kite festival function, kept mum when this correspondent pointed it out to them and apprehended accident. 

 Manglesh Trivedi (39), working for a private shipping company, had come with his family members. He also raised the matter, but no one cared. “The BSTDC officials neither provided life jacket nor asked the private boatmen to ply their boats only after providing life jackets to the passengers,” Trivedi said.
 
 “There are only two boats arranged by the administration for the people to reach the Ganga diara. The other boats, around 10, were quite old. The jetty should at least have ropes on either side to prevent people from falling into the river,” Trivedi, who is also captain of his ship, told TOI. 
 
 Santosh Kumar (40), a resident of Ashok Rajpath, said, “The way administration is neglecting safety requirements, only god can save people.”
 
 Anshu Verma, a homemaker from Jagdeo Path, said she was hesitant but had no other option than to board a boat having 35-40 passengers against its capacity of carrying 20. “When I objected, the boatman asked me to leave. Since all the boats had almost same number of passengers, I just boarded one in the name of God,” said Verma.
