 and Prince Harry’s   is one of the most-anticipated and talked about events in the world. The two will be walking down the aisle on May 19th. Father of the bride, Thomas will take his daughter’s hands in his’ as she marries her prince charming in Windsor Castle, England.

 Despite several controversies surrounding Meghan Markle’s half brother and half sister not attending the wedding, the parents of the bride-to-be have ensured that they make their daughter’s D-day a memorable one. As per reports, Thomas Markle and the bride-to-be's mother Doria Ragland, who divorced three decades ago, will arrive in Britain in the week before the royal wedding to "spend time" with Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip. 
 
 
 The report also cites that Meghan’s parents will also be meeting Harry’s father, Prince Charles ahead of the ceremony at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle. 
 
 
 With such tumultuous family issues, and Meghan’s close-knit group of friends, the American TV   will reportedly not be having a maid of honour. In fact, reports suggest that all her bridesmaids and pageboys will be children. 
 
 
 The couple will join the 600 wedding guests for a reception at the castle after the procession, departing later in the day for an evening reception for 200 at the nearby Frogmore House.
