PATNA: The Patna police continued to grope in the dark as their efforts to identify the  , who molested two sisters near   in the city on Thursday evening, proved an exercise in futility till Saturday evening.

 The girls said police showed them photographs of at least 20 suspects. “None of them appeared to be our tormentors,” said   (name changed), the younger of the two sisters. “But I can recognise them if they are brought before me,” the 16-year-old said.
 
 At least 150 CCTV cameras are installed in the city, and police have rummaged through the footage shot by the camera installed opposite a shopping mall near Rajapur Pul. “We could see the suspects riding a sports bike, but its registration number was not clear,” said a police officer.
 
 SSP Manu Maharaaj, it may be mentioned, suspended SI R D Burman of the Buddha Colony police station for allegedly refusing to lodge the girls’ FIR against the two youths who passed lewd comments, scratched Shikha’s face and dragged Shrishti by her hair for 40-50 metres in full public view around 6pm. Police have not been able to get any CCTV footage of the place of occurrence.
 
 “We have detained a few suspects,” DSP (law and order) Shibli Nomani said on Saturday and claimed police will soon arrest the culprits.
