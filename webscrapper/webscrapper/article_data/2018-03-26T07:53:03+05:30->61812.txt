AHMEDABAD:   of   (GU) has taken a decision of putting a   or any other digital device in examination centres. Issuing a circular, GU has stated that not even principals or any other staff deployed at   can use cellphones.

 At a recently held meeting of the committee, it was decided that cellphones will be prohibited at examination room, campus where the exam is being held and also in the staff room so that irregularities can be prevented. If a student or any other staff member is held having question-paper in cellphone, then a copying case would be registered against the person. 
 
 As of now, use of cellphone was prohibited only in classrooms but as incidents of circulating question papers on cellphones were found, the GU authority has introduced this new provision.
 
 “Today, students come from other towns to appear in exams and if they are not allowed to carry their cellphones even on the campus, then where would they keep their cellphones? If a student, who comes from any other town, witnesses some medical or any other kind of emergency, how will he approach his family or any friends? If any error occurs in the examination procedure, how would principal contact the examination conducting authority,” asked an anxious parent.
 
 Sources said that the decision was opposed by several GU members when it was proposed by the examination reform committee. But it was later put before the GU syndicate and it got a nod unanimously.
