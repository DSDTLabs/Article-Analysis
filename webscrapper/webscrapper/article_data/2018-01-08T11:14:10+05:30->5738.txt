NEW DELHI: Not being a part of the Indian Test team seems to have made the former skipper   fittest than ever before. Reason? The 2011   winning captain is getting plenty of time to do physical training, which he couldn't afford to do while playing all the formats of the game. Dhoni, who retired from Test cricket more than three years ago (30 December, 2014), but continues to represent India in ODIs and T20Is, spends nearly eight-and-half hours in training.

 Sources in BCCI told TOI that Dhoni spends two-and-half hours from eight in the morning to half-past 10 in outdoor training and then again does a plenty of indoor training and nets in the afternoon session, which is generally between 3 and 9 pm. “It’s a fixed schedule for him and he is constantly on the field training and going through the motion. There isn’t a day in his life when he isn’t training,” a board official told TOI on Sunday.
 
 "He is feeling fitter than the 2004-05 seasons because he couldn't get that many hours for physical training those days. With MS playing only in shorter formats, he is able to spend plenty of time to strengthen his body and discussing the nuisances of the game," official said.
 
 The BCCI sources also said that Dhoni has shown an interest to continue playing for India till the   in England. The fact that he is working hard and able to beat youngsters like Hardik Pandya in short races also proves that Dhoni isn’t going anywhere. With the India ODI team scheduled to leave for South Africa towards the month end, Dhoni’s presence would be of great help for incumbent captain Virat Kohli, who has often described his predecessor as a boon for the team.
