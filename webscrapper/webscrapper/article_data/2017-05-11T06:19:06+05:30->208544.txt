SHIMLA: Debate over   in the Congress has divided the state government and Pradesh   (PCC) in Himachal Pradesh. While PCC has already issued the schedule of elections starting with the   on May 15, chief minister   has opposed it saying that in the   such an exercise could harm the interest of the party rather than benefiting it.

 The Congress has already given the slogan of ‘Mission Repeat’ and realising that organisational elections could cast its shadow in the assembly election, Virbhadra Singh has brought the issue into the notice of the party high command, sources said. They said all MLAs had agreed that organisational elections could be avoided with only a few months left for the assembly polls, in the Congress Legislature Party meeting held recently. 
 
 However, sources in PCC said organisational elections would be held as per the schedule released by the All India Congress Committee. They said Public Relation Officers and Additional Public Relation Officers would be arriving soon to conduct the elections, which would continue till October end. As per the schedule, election of PCC president, vice-presidents, treasurer, PCC executive members, AICC members to be conducted by PCC general body would be held between September 16 to October 15. 
 
 A senior PCC leader said organisational elections would not affect the assembly polls as party has already devised their strategy to launch state-wide campaign for poll preparation. The leader said as part of the initial strategy for upcoming assembly polls, district level conventions of booth delegates would be held to strengthen the party at grassroots level. It was also decided that to strengthen the organisational structure, five member committees will be formed at all booths in each district.
