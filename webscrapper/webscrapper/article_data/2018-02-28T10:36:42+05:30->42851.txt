NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   and BJP president Amit Shah will address chief ministers and deputy chief ministers of party-ruled states in a meeting on Wednesday in which their "pro-poor" and development policies will be reviewed. 

 "The meeting will review how benefits of ongoing welfare schemes are reaching the most needy from various sections, including women, tribals and Dalits," BJP media cell chief Anil Baluni said.
 
 He added that besides Shah, other senior leaders will be part of the deliberations as part of a regular meeting with chief ministers and deputy chief ministers of states ruled by it. With barely a year left for the next Lok Sabha polls, BJP is keen to position itself as a "pro-poor" party with an eye on Dalits and other backward classes (OBC), two groups which have warmed up to the party under Modi and Shah. 
 
 The meeting comes in the wake of the Congress-led opposition stepping up its attack on the government over issues related to agriculture and employment opportunities.
