CHANDIGARH: A division bench of the   on Wednesday stayed the single judge bench's order quashing the appointment of retired bureaucrat   as chief principal secretary to Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh. 

 With this, Kumar can return to the CMO if he wishes to. Sources said the state government will take a call on Thursday after studying the order.
 
 With former Union minister and senior lawyer   representing it for the appeal, the Punjab government questioned the locus of the petitioner - Ramandeep Singh of Mohali - to raise the issue.
 
 The appeal also stated that the findings of the single bench were factually incorrect and against the principles of law. It was submitted that the judge incorrectly concluded that Kumar was enjoying "inherent powers". The plea added that the judge did not mention which sovereign function Kumar could perform.
 
 The division bench comprising Justice   and Justice Rajbir Sehrawat was of the view that apparently the order passed by the single bench was "coram non judice" (without jurisdiction) and the matter required "deeper deliberations".
 
 The division bench also held that even if it accepted the petitioner's locus, the matter should have been treated as public interest litigation (PIL) given that Ramandeep was not directly affected by Kumar's appointment.
 
 "Since the learned single judge who dealt with the matter was not bestowed with the subject roster, the judgment in these circumstances could possibly be construed as coram non judice. Even otherwise the matter needs deeper deliberation", the judges stated and asked the petitioner to file his reply by April 17.
