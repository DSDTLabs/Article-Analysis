Pune: A group of wildlife organisations has turned to school students to improve awareness about co-existence with leopards.

 It has started a year-long project to educate school students, who were designated as “leopard ambassadors”. They students were subsequently entrusted with the task of making their respective communities aware of more acceptability of the techniques.
 
 “The project, titled ‘Doodling the Cat’, managed to cover 32 villages in Junnar and Sangamner talukas over a year. It had begun in January last year and concluded in February this year. The main focus was to minimise the problems faced by humans as well as leopards in sharing space,” Widlife Conservation Society (WCS), India researcher Mrunal Ghosalkar said. 
 
 “We had selected 90 ambassadors among school students from standards 7 to 10. We explained them the ways to share their space safely with leopards by using flash cards illustrated by Pune-based Aditi Deo from Doodle Factory. These cards explain the precautions and the dos and don’ts in dealing with the presence of a  . In addition, we screened a short film, ‘Waghoba Cha Khatla’, for them at various community gatherings,” she said.
 
 Explaining the reason for selecting students for the projects, Ghosalkar said, “Communities living in the leopard-dense regions are not as accepting of information from outsiders. So, with a student from within the community, the awareness would spread more easily.”
 
 “In addition, these students are the future residents of these regions. “It’s a positive thing that they are well-informed about the way for a co-existence with leopards at an early age,” she added. 
 
 Apart from WCS and Doodle Factory, the territorial forest divisions of Junnar and Sangamner as well as Ovitla Landga and Rufford Foundation were also involved in the efforts. Junnar and Sangamner have high leopard density.
