PUNE: The initial investigation into the   in which 12 Central   (CRPF) personnel were killed in Sukma in Chhattisgarh shows that a huge quantity of explosives was used by the attackers, a top   officer told TOI.

 A team of experts from Talegaon-based Institute of Improvised Explosive Devices Management (IIM) visited Sukma and recovered at least seven high explosive bombs, 15 arrowhead bombs and about 20 IED command wires from the site. 
 
 It was one of the deadliest attacks on security forces. At least 112 personnel of CRPF's 219th battalion were out for a road opening task on March 11 in the dense forests near Kottacheru village under Bhejji police station when they were ambushed and their arms were looted. 
 
 “The recovery of the explosives and cartridges from the spot clearly indicates that the Maoists used a huge quantity of the explosives to inflict maximum casualties on the CRPF force,” a senior CRPF officer told TOI. 
 
 The findings also indicated that bullets were fired extensively from AK-47, SLRs and Insas rifles.“The bullet casualties are also considerable. They were fired on from all directions and hence the CRPF personnel could not counter attack,” the officer added.
 
 Decoding the attack , the officer said, the Maoists used IEDs through a command wire system, and immediately shot several rounds followed by arrowhead bombs. “Such an operation would need at least 100 Maoists,” the source said. They were getting hold of commercial explosives used for mining, he added.
 
 “We are trying to establish the modus Maoists used in this attack. Based on our reports, we will draw up a counter attack strategy for future use,” commandant of the institute   said.
 
 About 1,700 live IEDs were recovered from Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, some parts of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Gadchiroli in Maharashtra in 2015. Maoists triggered 40 blasts in Chhattisgarh in 2015, CRPF records indicate.
