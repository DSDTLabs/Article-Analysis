Actor  , who has earned an   nomination for her role of a rebellious teenager in  's ' ', shot most of the film without any makeup as she wanted the portrayal to look authentic. 

  
  
 According to a report, the actor said she wanted her character to look different than the teenagers with perfect skin in movies.
 
 "It's important because that's what happens to people's skin, especially when they're teenagers - they're really stressed out and their hormones are bouncing off the walls. There have been portrayals of teenagers in the past where they've got perfect skin and maybe one spot for 'the zit' scene." 
 
 Ronan said she was working a lot and meeting a lot of press while simultaneously working on a play which is why for the first time ever her skin got bad. 
 
 "I think it happens to a lot of girls in their twenties and it seemed like it would've been a missed opportunity if we didn't see this as a way to make ('Lady Bird') as authentic and relatable as possible," she said. 
 
 'Lady Bird' revolves around a mother and daughter and their turbulent bond. 
 
 The film is slated to be released in India on March 2.
