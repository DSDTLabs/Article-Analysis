 “For a long time, Railways denied that I was even a passenger on the train that day. I was asked to appear before court only a month ago and the Lucknow bench of the tribunal has ordered in my favour finally,” said Sinha. “Had they not tried to play manipulative and stayed with the truth, they would have had to pay a lesser compensation than what has been ordered now,” said the Ambedkar nagar native who lives in Lucknow now.
 
 Explaining the case,  , who fought the case on behalf of Sinha, told TOI, “Railways was not accepting her to being a bona fide passenger and were claiming that she had jumped off the train herself. We produced the original ticket and other witnesses from the day and proved the truth.”
