PUNE: A 36-year-old software engineer on Sunday morning got a rude shock when he found Rs 1 lakh had been siphoned from his savings account through 11withdrawals.

 The withdrawals were made at an ATM in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh.
 
 The victim, however, had his debit card with him at the time of the incident. Dhanoriebased Dinesh   lodged a police complaint on Wednesday .
 
 On Sunday , Ghosale received 11text messages on his cell phone between 8.30 and 8.37am, stating that his debit card had been used to withdraw different amounts totalling Rs1lakh.
 
 “All these transactions happened so quickly that Ghosale did not find time to report it to the bank or block the card,“ Vishrantwadi assistant inspector S P   said.
 
 Mane suspects the card might have been cloned. “He has his debit card with him and has never visited Allahabad. He did not share information about his card with anyone,“ Mane said. “Interestingly, he did not receive any phone call asking details of his card or bank account,“ he added. Sources from the police de partment said the cy bercrime cases are on rise in the district; ho wever, there is no ade quate mechanism at police stations to de tect such cases effecti vely.
 
 A senior police officer said, “To detect cybercrime cases one requires special expertise and training. Sadly , many police personnel posted at different police stations are not well trained and do not have adequate knowledge to take the case forward.
 
 Police have repeatedly alerted people against disclosing their bank account and debit card details to anyone.
