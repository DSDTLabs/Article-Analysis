PANAJI: The four-year rule of the   government has been a failure marked by betrayal of promises and discrimination based on religion and food preferences, the   said here on Saturday.

 Releasing a 10-point primer on the NDA’s policies which the Congress claimed had hurt the nation’s economy, former Union law minister and state Congress spokesperson   said that it was time for citizens to vote out the   government.
 
 Addressing a press conference in the presence of Mandrem MLA   and St Cruz MLA Tony Fernandes,   said that Modi not only failed to create jobs, but also implemented policies that affected the economy. “The four-year of BJP is a saga of failures, u-turns, fear and social discrimination leading to the segregation of the people of India based on religion and food preferences,” said Khalap. “Congress denounces this misrule of four years. It is time to dislodge this government in 2019 and to install a public-oriented government that will ensure equality.”
 
 The state Congress said that Modi’s failure to create adequate employment opportunities for youth had resulted in “total disappointment among the youth, anger and in the next few months it is going to turn into a wave of discontent.”
 
 “Against the promise of 2 crore jobs every year, the government has created just 4.16 lakh jobs,” Khalap said. “This is the biggest failure.”
