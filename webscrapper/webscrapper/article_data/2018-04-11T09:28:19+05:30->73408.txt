CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Tuesday denied   to Subhiksha retail chain founder R  , who was arrested by the   (ED) on February 28, under Prevention of Money Laundering Act for defrauding investors in a chit fund scam.

 Noting that Subramanian has been charged for grave economic offences for having laundered amounts to the tune of over Rs 700 crore and the investigation is at the initial and crucial stage, Justice A D Jagadish Chandira said: “I am of the view that if bail is granted to the petitioner at this stage it will be prejudicial to ED. Accordingly, this bail petition is dismissed.”
 
 Subramanian is the promoter and managing director of M/s Subhiksha Trading Services Limited, a retail chain of stores which used to sell products under the category of Fast Moving Consumer Goods ( ), pharma, groceries, fruits and vegetables among others. The retail chain closed down in 2009 after it ran into a cash crunch.
