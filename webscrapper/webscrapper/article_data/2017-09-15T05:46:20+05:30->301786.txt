ALWAR/ JAIPUR: The   has decided to move the High Court after a   (CID-CB) report gave a clean chit to six persons named by dairy farmer Pehlu Khan -who was lynched by cow vigilantes on April 1 -in his “dying declaration“.

 Khan's son Irshad, who was accompanying his father when   attacked them, said he had clearly heard the attackers call each other's names during the attack. “This is betrayal. We heard the names (of the accused) when they attacked my father. How can they be given a clean chit? We will fight till the accused are proven guilty ,“ Irshad said.
 
 The   has accused the CID-CB of working under pressure of certain groups. Community leader Sher Mohammad said the investigating agency didn't even record the statement of Khan's two sons who were accompanying their father when the mob attacked them. “The moment the state government handed over the investigation to CID-CB in July, we knew it was trying to give the case a new twist,“ he said.
 
 The investigating agency, however, has given a clean chit to the six men on the basis of the statements of the staff of a cow shelter and their mobile call records. The cow shelter staff said the six men were present there at the time of the attack. Police, however, said nine others, who were identified on the basis of the videos  , will continue to face charges.
