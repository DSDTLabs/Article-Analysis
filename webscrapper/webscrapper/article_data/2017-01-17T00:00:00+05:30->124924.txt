The day-long festival, which was open for all, saw around 500 people across all ages come together to fly kites and to bond with each other. While the elders rekindled their childhood   at the event, the younger ones took the opportunity to engage in other fun activities like getting tattoos of kites, and wall-climbing. The festival too, stayed true to its reputation and saw myriad varieties of kites â€” ranging from patriotic, to those with inspiring slogans, and those shaped as birds and animals. An impromptu jamming session, and various street-food stalls, kept the participants busy.
