Ponda: A month after several trees were felled by the Dhatwada-Usgao plant of Madras Rubber Factory (MRF), Usgao-Ganjem villagers resolved at the Sunday gram sabha to revoke the permission issued to the proposed expansion of the factory.

 The gramsabha was attended by only two panchayat members of the 11-member panchayat. A similar resolution was passed by a gramsabha held on November 20, 2016, on the grounds of destruction of ecology and fearing that the pollution levels would go up further, after the expansion. But, there was no action by the village panchayat, villagers said.
 
 Locals said that they are against the expansion of the plant as they fear that the free carbon particles emanating from the existing rubber tyre plant will spread in the vicinity and could spread pulmonary diseases in the village.
 
 The issue was triggered after the factory felled over 300 arecanut trees and about 127 forest trees for the expansion of the project, besides felling 625 coconut palms on January 17. About hundred villagers gathered at the expansion site and later approached the panchayat office demanding that the expansion be stopped immediately.
 
 “As the panchayat failed to act on their demand, the villagers submitted a written memorandum to the panchayat on January 30. The resolution, passed in the gramsabha, was submitted by the villagers,” Devidas Naik, a resident of Dhatwada said.
