Neeraj Madhav's look in   as a seemingly leftist student leader wearing a red shirt soon became a meme for a politician, going international even. However, the actor says he is least bothered about the fact, and in fact, enjoys it. "I found different versions of it, with the colour of my shirt changed often. It was also scene in a post which read, Tage a friend who is a politician. I even found it in an international platform 'Be like Bro'. I'm glad the look was accepted," he says.
