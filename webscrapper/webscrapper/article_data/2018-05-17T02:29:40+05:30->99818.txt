NEW DELHI: A seven-year-old   challenged girl was raped by a 20-year-old man at a factory in northwest Delhi’s Swaroop Nagar on Tuesday evening. The accused, Sonu, lured the child with a toy while she was playing outside her house, took her to a bathroom inside the factory and raped her. He let her off and stayed back for a smoke.

 
 In the meantime, the survivor reached home with blood on her clothes and narrated the incident to her mother. When her father asked where the assault had happened, she started crying and pointed towards the vacant factory. “We saw him stepping out of the factory and chased him. He fell while trying to board a bus and was caught by our relatives,” said the child’s father. Sonu was thrashed and handed over to police. The child was sent for medical examination.
 
 In her statement, the child told counsellors that Sonu used to play with her after returning from work. On the day of the incident, he offered to get her a toy and promised to drop her back home. After   her, Sonu threatened the girl with dire consequences if she complained about the assault to anyone.
 
 Sonu, a resident of Samaipur Badli, had rented a room in the colony a few weeks ago. He used to work at a canteen and served the labourers visiting the place.
 
 The survivor was taken to Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital where she was treated for her injuries. A case of rape and under POCSO Act has been registered against Sonu. Cops are probing whether he had assaulted other children in the area as well. His mobile phone is being scanned to find out whether he had clicked photographs of the child while raping her.
