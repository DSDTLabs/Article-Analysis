NAGPUR: Roshni Patil (30), whose husband had forced her to consume some poisonous substance, was declared dead by doctors at   on Wednesday. Patil’s husband, 36 year old Mukesh had died earlier as he too had consumed poison after he tried to kill Roshni at their place in   on January 29. 

 Yashodhara Nagar police, who had lodged a complaint of accidental death and offence of attempt to murder against deceased Mukesh, now has slapped him with murder charges. Roshni had filed several FIRs of domestic feud in the police station following physical and mental abuse at her husband’s hands. 
 
 The couple is survived by two sons, Sarthak (8) and Sandesh (5), said cops. Mukesh, who was an alcoholic, used to doubt over Roshni’s character and never allowed her to go out for work. 
 
 Earlier too, once Mukesh, who was unemployed, had left home and returned after a fortnight. As Roshni had lodged a missing complaint, he had to go to the police station after Roshni left home following abuse at his hands. The cops had helped bring Roshni back from her maternal place. But Mukesh’s misbehaviour continued.
