PATIALA: In a bid to let their buses running under the kilometre scheme enter Chandigarh, Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) has started the process of finalising an agreement with owners of km scheme buses. Under the agreement, buses will be transferred in the name of   as the Chandigarh administration does not allow km scheme buses to enter Chandigarh bus stand. 

 For a long time, owners did not agree to the PRTC proposal, but a number of them are open to it now. There are more than 50 Volvo and HVAC buses of the corporation running on various routes in Punjab and other states. The Corporation wanted its AC buses under the km scheme to enter Chandigarh to boost revenue.
 
 Recently, it was announced that digital payment modules would be launched to buy bus tickets by launching a mobile app and an online portal. The corporation developed an in-house online ticketing system, which was outsourced till now. It is hoping to save on the commission that was being paid to private companies for online booking.
 
 "Under this agreement, km scheme buses will be transferred in the name of PRTC and allowed to enter. While a few ordinary buses of the Corporation were entering the city, buses which were not registered in the name of PRTC were not allowed. The three owners concerned have signed an agreement while others are in the queue," said MD, PRTC M S Narang.
 
 At present, Pepsu Road Transport Corporation is running its sanctioned fleet of 1,075 buses, including 250 under the km scheme. It covers 3.5 lakh km every day and earns revenue of Rs 1.46 crore.
