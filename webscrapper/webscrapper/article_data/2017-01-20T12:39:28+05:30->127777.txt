Singer-rapper   is reportedly undergoing therapy which will help him recover from his hospitalisation. 

 The 39-year-old rapper was admitted to hospital in November for treatment for "temporary psychosis" and is now working on doing "whatever it takes" to improve his mental health.
 
 "Kanye swore he was going to continue with intense therapy. He really wants to get better and will do whatever it takes to get healthy," a source said. 
 
 The therapy has apparently made things better between him and wife Kim Kardashian, reported Us magazine. 
 
 "She didn't realise how much of Kanye's behaviour stems from a mental illness. When he's doing the things his therapists tell him to do, she is so much happier. It has allowed them to reconnect," the source added.
