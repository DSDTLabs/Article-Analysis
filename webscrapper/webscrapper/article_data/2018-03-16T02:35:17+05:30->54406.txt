Navi Mumbai: Following the ruling BJP’s decision to move a no-confidence motion against   commissioner Sudhakar Shinde, as many as 60 social organizations have come forward to back the civic head by holding a public   as a show of citizen strength and pass a confidence motion in his favour. The mega public gathering will be held at Middleclass Society Ground in Panvel on March 21.

 According to the organizers, no political parties will be allowed to take part in the rally since it’s apolitical. “In the rally, we will move a no-confidence motion against the corporators who have made up their mind to vote against Shinde. We want Shinde to continue as commissioner for the full term,” said  .
 
 The citizens groups, including housing societies, have called a meeting on Friday to decide the course of the rally. A committee will be formed to coordinate with NGOs, citizens groups, housing societies, volunteers and the youth to highlight Shinde’s good work, said Arun Bhise of Citizens Unity Forum.
 
 According to Mangal Kamble, head of Swachh Kharghar Foundation, “A collective effort of several associations will work in favour of Shinde who is an upright officer. We will pledge our support for his continuation. We are planning to meet the CM to apprise him of problems faced by the residents due to differences between PCMC and Cidco.”
 
 Meanwhile, opposition alliance of Congress, NCP and PWP have said that they will oppose any no-confidence motion to oust Shinde.
