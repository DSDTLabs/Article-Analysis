You might remember your parents or grandparents suggesting to you at the dinner table to eat slowly and chew your food properly. Somewhere deep down at the back of our mind, we all know that it is right and good for our health. However, in todayâ€™s fast-paced lifestyle; we forget to follow this simple but very effective practice for our overall health. 

 According to a Japanese research, people who eat slowly are less likely to become obese or develop a metabolic syndrome - a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke. Metabolic syndrome occurs when someone has any of the following risk factors: abdominal obesity, high fasting blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides and/or low   (good cholesterol) levels. 
 
 The research team evaluated 642 men and 441 women, with an average age of 51.2 years, who did not have prior metabolic syndrome. They divided the participants into three groups depending on how they described their usual eating speed: slow, normal or fast.
 
 After five years of research, they found fast eaters were more likely (11.6 %) to develop metabolic syndrome than normal eaters (6.5 %) or slow eaters (2.3 %). It was also shown that faster eating speed was associated with more weight gain, higher blood glucose and larger waistline.
 
 Takayuki Yamaji, M.D., study author and cardiologist at Hiroshima University in Japan, suggested that eating more slowly might be a crucial lifestyle change to prevent metabolic syndrome. 
 
 He explained that when people eat fast they do not to feel full and are more likely to overeat. Moreover, eating fast causes bigger glucose fluctuation, which can lead to insulin resistance. He further added that this principle is also applicable to other ethnicities also.
