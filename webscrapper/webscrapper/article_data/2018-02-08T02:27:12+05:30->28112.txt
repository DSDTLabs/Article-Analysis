NEW DELHI: The Delhi government wants to introduce “happiness” classes in all its schools from nursery to Class VIII starting next  . This was announced on Wednesday by deputy chief minister   at the Excellence Awards.

 Sisodia said it is necessary to teach children to be happy, in view of the recent reports of violence among children in their schools across the country. The curriculum for the subject is currently being prepared by a team of   officials, and the evaluation of the activity-based subject will be done through a happiness index.
 
 “We will see if the child gets happier or remains happy as years pass, and evaluate him through an index,” he said. He stressed that this will be not an academic subject but a activity-based period held every day.
 
 He said that the government wants to “train young minds to be happy”. “Over the last year we have had several requests to bring back moral education in the curriculum. But we want to start a happiness curriculum. It will not pertain to any religion or have any such references. It will be based on the science of happiness,” he said.
 
 He also announced that from the next year, schools would also be rewarded for their activities in conservation of the environment. Students would be awarded in two new categories — for the best activity conducted in eco clubs, and for best utilisation of land available to become the “most green school”.
 
 The Excellence Awards were awarded to meritorious students from Class X and XII from last academic year. This year, 29 children with special needs were also conferred with the award. A new award category was introduced this year — the Chunauti award — recognising one teacher from each school and four schools from every district for their work during the Chunauti campaign.
