NEW DELHI: A day after the shootout and   at  , cops are yet to track   alias Dhilloo. A team of investigators are camping at his relative’s house in Sonepat and Ballabhgarh. Dhilloo allegedly used that as a safe house to escape cops. His wife and brother are being questioned about his whereabouts. It was also found that the escape was planned by hired professionals from Haryana.

 Police are analysing the role of Dhilloo’s wife and brother-in-law, who were in touch with   Sunil alias Tillu’s gang members for the past few weeks. Cops suspect that Sunil might have struck a deal with Dhilloo to eliminate a few members of his rival Gogi gang after the murders of his gang members, Ravi Bhardwaj and Deepak.
 
 Cops suspect that Tillu’s gang members have been actively looking for a sharpshooter who could be apt for the job. 
 
 Though cops claim that they were close to tracking down Dhilloo in NCR, sources said that he might have fled to the Nepal border.
 
 Through footage recovered from Delhi Gate and ITO, cops are trying to identify two youths. They have also recovered a YouTube video in which Dhilloo appealed to the youths asking if he could join their gang. They suspect that he might have been trying to gain turf in areas around Narela and Sonepat. The video also features Tillu and one Vikey Kansaliya.
