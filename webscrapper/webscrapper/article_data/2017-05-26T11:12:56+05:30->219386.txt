PATNA: The decision of CM   to skip the meeting called by Congress chief   on Friday to discuss the opposition’s presidential candidate has set tongues wagging in political circles. It was Nitish who mooted the idea of opposition’s common presidential candidate and even proposed the name of Pranab Mukherjee for the post.

 Although the JD (U) claimed nothing should be read between the lines and there was no need to jump to the conclusion of possible political realignment in the state, senior functionaries of other two Mahgatbandhan allies – Congress and   – said the decision has sent wrong message to opposition unity in the country. 
 
 A senior RJD functionary and a close aide of party boss   said Nitish has tried to walk a different path on several occasions. “When PM   announced demonetisation, Nitish openly came out in support of the move. He never criticises the Centre for its foreign policy failures,” he said, adding Nitish’s decision to skip Friday’s meeting called by Sonia Gandhi has cast doubt on his intentions.
 
 A minister in Nitish cabinet from Congress quota said the alliance of Congress, RJD and JD (U) is state specific and Nitish has his own plans at national level. “This is not a secret and we are not much surprised by his decision to skip the meeting,” he added. 
 
 However, JD (U) said party’s   MP Sharad Yadav will attend the meeting. “We have formal invitation from Congress to attend the meeting. Nitish ji will not be able to attend the meeting due to his prior engagements. He already had two rounds of one-to-one discussions on different national issues, including President’s election. If he is not attending the meeting, it should not be wrongly interpreted,” said JD (U) spokesman Ajay Alok.
