Panaji: Goa state pollution control board (GSPCB) will hold a hearing to review the consent to operate granted by it to a restaurant and night club in Anjuna. This was agreed upon by the parties before national green tribunal (NGT), Pune, in an appeal filed by social activist, Kashinath Shetye and others, alleging that the GSPCB had not heard him before issuing consent to operate dated March 3, 2016, to Curlies, the Anjuna restaurant-cum- nightclub despite a detailed complaint about violations of CRZ notification, 2011, dated August 17, 2015, to the board. While disposing off the appeal, the bench comprising judicial member, Justice U D Salvi and expert member, Ajay A Deshpande, held that as there was consensus regarding the review of the consent to operate, the board should hold the hearing on July 19, 2017, for both parties to consider the objections raised to it and pass an order as per with law within four weeks.  After this order was passed, the nightclub owner withdrew another case filed against GSPCB. Further, GSPCB should take a decision after the hearing within four weeks and convey it to both parties accordingly.
