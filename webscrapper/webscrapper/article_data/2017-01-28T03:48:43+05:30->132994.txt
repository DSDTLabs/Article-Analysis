NEW DELHI: BJP said that   for Punjab, which was released on Friday, appears to be a “cut-paste job” as it is similar to its poll promises in Delhi before 2015 assembly elections. 

 The party asked people of Punjab to learn from Delhi’s experience, where AAP failed to deliver on its poll promises in the last two years.
 
 Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari highlighted AAP’s failure to deliver on its 14 poll promises, which it made to the people of Delhi and has made again in Punjab. The manifesto promises compensation to victims of 1984 riots, food at subsidised rates at Aam Aadmi Canteens, slashing of power tariff by half for usages up to 400 unit, laptop for all government school students, CCTVs in schools, waiver on residential property tax etc.
 
 “The manifesto looks like a cut-paste job. People of Punjab should learn something from suffering of Delhiites, who have been deprived on basic services,” said Tiwari.
 
 BJP said that AAP had promised 50% reduction in electricity tariff, but when it came to power it slashed tariff only on the first 200 units. “Similarly, till date no Aam Aadmi Canteen has come up in Delhi. To mislead people the party has named a hospital canteen as Aam Aadmi Canteen,” said Tiwari.
 
 The northeast Delhi MP slammed Delhi chief minister   for promising housing to poor. 
 
 “While seeking public support in Delhi, the party had promised that it will simplify the property tax system. But after coming to power, it started building pressure on BJP-led corporations to increase property tax. This exposes AAP, as they have gone back or not delivered on any of its promises,” said Tiwari.
