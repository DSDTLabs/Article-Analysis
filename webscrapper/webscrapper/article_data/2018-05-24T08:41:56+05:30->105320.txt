BERLIN: Germany’s second largest city,  , will ban the most polluting diesel cars from two major streets from next week, in a move that could encourage other cities to follow suit and step up the pressure on carmakers to consider costly vehicle refits.

 
 Hamburg, home to 1.8 million people, said the ban would affect diesel models that do not meet the latest   emissions standards. The move follows a ruling in February by Germany’s top administrative court that said the cities of   and   should consider bans for older diesel models.
 
 The bans affect a section of about 1,600 metres on Stresemannstrasse, where the restrictions will only apply to commercial vehicles weighing 3.5 tonnes or more, and a section of about 580 metres on Max-Brauer-Allee, covering all diesel vehicles.
