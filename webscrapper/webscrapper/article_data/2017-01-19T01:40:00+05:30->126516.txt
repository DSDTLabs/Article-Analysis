Mumbai: As compared to any other country, India is poised for phenomenal growth when it comes to   travel, according to a joint paper released by a   company and a private consultancy firm on Wednesday. 

 It said that the current US$ 30 billion business travel market sector is expected to more than triple to $93 billion by 2030. 
 
 “In 2015, India saw a 15% increase in business travel spending, which will grow by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% through 2020 to 6% by 2030. This increase in all possibility will be greater than the increases in business travel growth in the next three largest countries combined, including South Korea, Italy and Brazil,” said the study by FCM Travel Solutions and KPMG. It added that by 2030, India will likely be among the top five in business travel spending. Jaideep Ghosh of KPMG said: “India will emerge as a leader in business travel spending over the next decade or so. When one looks at India, one sees one of the highest growth rates in business travel in the entire world. If India continues on that trend, in another 15-20 years, it will surpass the US as well and be second only to China. India is statistically where China was close to 15 years back.” 
 
 According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, the travel industry comprising business and leisure segments was a $7.2 trillion market globally in 2015, dominated by leisure spends. Compared to the overall market growth of 3.1%, business travel spends grew by 5%, led by growing business activity in developing countries.
