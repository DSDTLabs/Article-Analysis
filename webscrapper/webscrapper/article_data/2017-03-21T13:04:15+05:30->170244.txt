HYDERABAD: The government was left red-faced for a brief while in the   on Monday even as Speaker S   was forced to placate   floor leader G   over how a question he posed was ‘edited’. 

 It was during the Question Hour, after minister Etela Rajendar replied to his question, that Kishan Reddy said that two parts of his four-part question had been edited out. The query pertained to the subsidy for one rupee kilo rice scheme.
 
 Demanding to know who deleted the question, Kishan Reddy said, “I want a ruling on this. I would like to know who did it and would like action taken on this matter.” Even as he was speaking,   secretary Raja Sadaram was seen briefing the Speaker, ostensibly on this matter.
 
 The Speaker explained that another similar question was posted and the deleted portions of Kishan Reddy’s question were tagged to that and the BJP member was also added to the list of questioners. Kishan Reddy took serious objection to this and wanted to know if his question was considered unimportant that it could be cut and added to someone else’s query. As leader of the opposition K   of the Congress also weighed in on the issue, calling the development ‘highly objectionable’, the Speaker said such things will not be repeated.
 
 “We are accepting,” he added, in possible reference to the mix-up regarding Kishan Reddy’s question.
