THANE: A nine-month old Palm   which was found severely   in Thane’s Kausa area on Wednesday night succumbed to her injuries at the Thane SPCA animal hospital on Friday.

 “We didn’t want to waste time figuring out what happened to the cat and rushed her to the hospital immediately. By the severity of the injuries it seems like she could have been run over by a car, or been attacked by a larger animal, or even possibly beaten by locals. We are now investigating the cause,” said an official at the Thane Range Forest. Even though the   cat was brought to the SPCA immediately, the veterinarian medicos feared that the injuries are too severe and could be fatal.
 
 “She had a fracture to her T12 vertebrae, paralysis, blood loss and severe wounds on her hind legs. Her condition was very critical. ,” said a member of Thane SPCA. — Freny Fernandes
