LUCKNOW: Taking a cue from the   (MY) equation that has helped the party sail through many elections, SP chief   has, this time, placed his bet on Muslim-Gujjar (MG) combination in 20 constituencies of west UP where the two communities together can play a decisive role.

 Electorally, Gujjars--an ethnic agrarian community which figures in the other backward class list--have had a limited appeal so far as they dominate only a handful of seats in West UP including Kairana, Shamli and pockets of Saharanpur district. But the new MG combination has increased their relevance this elections with SP fielding around 10 Gujjar candidates as compared to 6 Jats and 12 Muslims in the 73 assembly seats that will go to polls in the first phase on February 11. Most of the Gujjars follow Hinduism, while a section of them are Muslims. 
 
 “Traditionally, Jats and Gujjar don't see eye to eye. They vote for the candidate of their caste instead of the party. Former prime minister and former chief minister of UP   tried to bring Jat and Gujjar under one umbrella along with Muslims, Ahir (Yadavs) and Rajputs to form a grand alliance of farming community and backward classes in 70s and early 80s. He was successful in the West UP. In 2014, polarisation following Muzaffarnagar riots saw two communities voting for the BJP,“ said an analyst. SP leaders are confident that MG combination will yield positive results.
