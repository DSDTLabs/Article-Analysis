PATNA: Two days after former Bihar Pradesh   Committee (BPCC) president   left the party along with three other MLCs and joined the ruling JD (U) led by CM Nitish Kumar, three more Congress functionaries deserted the party on Saturday.

 Those who left the party on Saturday were former state secretary of   Mohan Tunna, former secretary of the party’s trader cell   and former secretary of sports cell Parimal Raj. Tunna and Kumar have cited “ill treatment” meted out to Choudhary as one of the reasons for quitting the party. All three were holding key party posts when Choudhary was the BPCC president.
 
 “These resignations will not impact the BPCC. The three who resigned on Saturday were just party workers,” BPCC acting president Kaukab Quadri said.
 
 Choudhary claimed more Congress functionaries will leave the party soon. The three MLCs, who had left Congress and joined JD (U) along with Choudhary were Dilip Kumar Choudhary, Tanweer Akhtar and  .
 
 “I was being humiliated in the Congress and I joined JD (U) because CM Nitish Kumar is a progressive leader. JD (U) does not play caste politics,” Choudhary said.
