RAMANATHAPURAM: Thousands of devotees from across the country visited the   temple in   on Tuesday on the occasion of Thai Amavasai, considered an auspicious day to pray for the souls of forefathers.

 Over one lakh people visited Ramanathaswamy temple on Tuesday, sources said.
 
 Priests performed rituals on the beach, popularly known as ‘Agnitheertham’. Hundreds of people sat on the beach from early morning and participated in the rituals. 
 
 As this was a rare occasion where the Thai Amavasai fell on the last day of a long weekend, the number of people who came to Rameswaram increased many fold. Traffic moved slowly on the   and pilgrims had to park their vehicles and walk a few km to reach the temple.
 
 Hotels and lodges also overflowed with crowds and some of the local people, allowed the pilgrims to change their clothes in their homes, after they took a dip in the sea. The sea was filled with clothes discarded by the devotees they bathed in it.
 
 Crowds also thronged the other temples in the southern districts in view of the festival, including Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple.
