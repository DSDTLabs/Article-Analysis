PATNA: The   (JPNI) at Patna saw 51.5% growth in passenger traffic in the first eight months (April- November) of the current fiscal 2017-18. It ranked eighth in the country insofar as the percentage increase in passengers’ flow over the corresponding period in 2016-17 is concerned.

 As per the date released by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) HQ, the Patna airport handled 20,24,568 flyers between April to November in 2017-18 as against 13,36,691 flyers during the same period in 2016-17.
 
 In terms of aircraft movement, altogether 14,594 flights, including outbound and inbound, operated from the Patna airport between April and November in 2017-18 as against 10,126 flights during the same period in 2016-17. The percentage growth in terms of aircraft movement was thus 44.1%.
 
 Till 2012-13, the number of flights operating from the Patna airport did not exceed ten. “Patna sector has been one of the country’s fastest growing sectors in terms of air traffic for the past few years. As of today, the airport is catering to no less than 4,000 flyers every day,” JPNI director Rajendra Singh Lahauria told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 Lahauria said the increased passenger traffic created the problem of paucity of space at the terminal building. “Works have commenced for the expansion of check-in area on the ground floor and security hold area (SHA) on the first floor as tentative measures ahead of the full-fledged extension of the terminal building,” he said.
 
 Sources said pre-fabricated porta cabins will be installed in front of the terminal building (where a temporary tent has been put up for now) to expand the check-in area. Similar expansion work will be done in the SHA at the first floor. The expanded check-in and SHA are likely to be readied by the end of February this year.
 
 New flight to Varanasi: Budget carrier IndiGo will start operating a flight on the Patna- Varanasi-Chennai route from February 1. The flight — 6E 441 — is scheduled to depart from Patna at 10.55am and land at Varanasi at 11.55am. From Varanasi, the same flight will go to Chennai where it will reach at 2.55pm.
