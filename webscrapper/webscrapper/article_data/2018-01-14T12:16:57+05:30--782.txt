BENGALURU: Four kidnappers were nabbed and Rs 59 lakh extorted as ransom from  , ex-gram panchayat member, was recovered on Saturday. Another Rs 45 lakh was seized from the accused as the source of income was not clear. 

 Mallikarjunappa alias Mallikarjunaiah, a resident of Marutinagar, Yelahanka, was abducted on January 11 during his morning walk and released a day later after his family handed over Rs 59 lakh as ransom.

 "Arshia Mubarak hatched the plan and teamed up with others. After learning of Mallikarjunappa's routine, Kantraj approached him near Yelahanka Main Road and said his son had sent him with a business proposal. The victim entered the car and Kantaraj drove the vehicle to a place near   and locked him up in a single-room house," cops said.
 
 They called his son Ravikumar and demanded Rs 100 crore. They later agreed to release him for Rs 1 crore. "But I could arrange only Rs 59 lakh, which I handed over to them near   on January 12. They took the cash and released my father," Ravikumar told police. 
 
  The income-tax department had raided Mallikarjunaiah in mid-2017 and there was a rumour that a large amount of cash had been seized. The accused plotted the kidnap based on this.
