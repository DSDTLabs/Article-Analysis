AHMEDABAD: Emerging from an era of stereotype content, the Gujarati film industry has now begun reflecting current events. A film titled ‘Tension Thai Gayu’, which went on the floor last week, focusses on demonetization. For film’s producer Kirti Patel, this subject is likely to catch everybody’s imagination because every citizen has been affected by the decision, which has evoked extreme reactions from people.

 Patel, a businessman who started a film production company   in Gandhinagar last year, said: “After the government’s decision to invalidate currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 10,000, I felt that everybody could easily relate with this subject. I decided to make a movie on this subject by showing people who used to hoard black money were tense as to how to get rid of the old currency since November 8,” he told TOI.
 
 Patel added, people relate with themes on current and burning issues rather than on literary and romantic subjects as projected in films for decades. 
 
 The film has been written by   and is being directed by Sridutt Vyas. Patel hopes that the movie will hit the screens in February.
