GHAZIABAD: The UP   has begun work on a structural design for the   in Ghaziabad, following the allotment of Rs 20 crore for the project. The state government allocated the sum for the project in its budget for the financial year 2017-18 on Tuesday.

 The project, conceived by the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation (GMC), will see a grand rest house for Kailash Mansoravar   and kanwariyas alongside GT Road, a few hundred metres away from Ala Hazrat Haj House. The latter was constructed during the reign of the Akhilesh Yadav-led government to serve as a transit house for Haj pilgrims bound for Mecca.
 
 “We are planning to have a common parking space for the Vishram Griha and the Haj House. The parking area being used by the Haj House at present belongs to the municipal corporation. We plan to accommodate parking for the Vishram Griha within this area as well. No deadline has been fixed yet on the Nirman Nigam to complete the design of the project. Ghaziabad would definitely be pleased to have the chief minister Yogi Adityanath as the chief guest in the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the project,” Ghaziabad mayor, Ashu Verma, told TOI.
 
 Incidentally, SP patriarch Mulayam Singh was the chief guest when the foundation stone of the Haj House was laid in March 2005. More than a decade later, the project was inaugurated by his son and then-CM Akhilesh Yadav last year.
 
 The GMC has already started soil-testing work at the site prior to construction of the building.
