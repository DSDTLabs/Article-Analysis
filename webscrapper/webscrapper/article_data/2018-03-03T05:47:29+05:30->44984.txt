VIJAYWADA: Nearly a month after Union home minister   gave the assurance,   president   on Friday telephoned   chief minister and TDP president   and told him to send a delegation to New Delhi on Monday to discuss 'all state-related issues.' 

 Since the presentation of the Union budget,   has been on a warpath over what it called meagre allocation for the state and wanted the Centre to make amends.
 
 After TDP MPs staged protests in Parliament in the first week of February, Rajnath Singh had assured them that BJP chief Amit Shah will speak to Naidu.
 
 According to Chief Ministerâ€™s Office (CMO) sources, after Shah called him, Naidu informed the BJP president that the fight for justice for AP will continue without any compromise. Naidu has decided to depute a three-member team comprising Union minister of state Sujana Chowdary, Srikakulam MP K Rammohan Naidu and AP planning board vice president C Kutumba Rao to meet Shah on Monday.
 
 Earlier on Thursday, Rammohan Naidu and Kutumba Rao met Amit Shah and appraised him about the issues that AP is facing. The team that will meet Shah on Monday is likely to submit more details on funds required by AP its projects.
