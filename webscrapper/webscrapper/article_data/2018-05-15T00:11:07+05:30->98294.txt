Kottayam: CMS College campus was a second home to renowned   Ennackal Chandy George Sudarshan (86), who passed away in Texas on Monday. His attachment to the college and his professors is common knowledge here as he would spend hours on campus whenever he visited Kerala.

 One small instance of his attachment was seen in 1982, when he brought two computers from the US and started a computer centre on campus at a time when such concepts were relatively new in the country. The college had no hesitation in naming the centre as George Sudarshan centre for physics and computer science. Retired professor Babu Cherian, who has chronicled the college’s history, Sudarshan dreamt of developing this centre into a world-class facility.
 
 One moment he cherished was a meeting with former President KR Narayanan, who introduced himself as an alumnus of the college right when Sudarshan too said the same. They had found a common ground and a connect.
 
  He was always happy to meet an alumnus.
 
 Sudarshan did his intermediate (1946-48) from this college. The time he spent at the college gave him a solid base that spurred him to various achievements, he had said during a campus visit.
 
 He last came here in 2011 to celebrate his 80th birthday with some of his batchmates, said Cherian, adding that Sudarshan was fluent in Malayalam despite spending a major part of his life in America. Though he studied in several world class universities, he considered George Thomas of physics department and PA Eapen of mathematics department as his mentors. “Both of them influenced him and his decision to join Madras Christian College was a result of their guidance,” he said.
 
 Sudarshan also donated his personal book collection to the college library. He also handed over the personal book collection of his co-physicist Robert Marshak to the college. According to Cherian, the collections of Sudarshan included very rare international science journals, even those from 1840.
