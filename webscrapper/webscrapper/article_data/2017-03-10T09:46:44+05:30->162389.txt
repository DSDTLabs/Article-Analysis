LUCKNOW:   existed in India 25,000 years ago, reveals a research conducted by   (BSIP). For the first time, DNA has been found in   fragments of ostriches. They were excavated from eight   in central and western India.

 The DNA is approximately 25,000 years old, found the study by a team of seven scientists led by BSIP director Sunil Bajpai. The study has been published in the prestigious science journal ‘PLOS ONE’. 
 
 “This study on fossil DNA is the first from India which reveals that the flightless bird native to Africa was present in India 25,000 years ago,” said Bajpai. 
 
 He added that the fossilized eggshell samples came from excavation sites and personal museum collection of the institute. The sites included Bundi, Kota and Chambal in Rajasthan, Ujjain, Bijora and Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh and Kachchh in Gujarat, he added.
 
 “BSIP now plans to establish a full-fledged laboratory for the study of fossil DNA,” said Bajpai.
 
 Bajpai said the relevance of the research was not confined to the revelation of the presence of the bird in India but also opened up a research dimension proving that DNA can be found in fossils. It is assumed that the possibility of the presence of DNA in a subtropical climate like that of our country is rare as it gets destroyed due to environmental and climatic conditions, he added. 
 
 The study was conducted over four years and also involved scientists from Indian   of Technology, Roorkee, and Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad.
