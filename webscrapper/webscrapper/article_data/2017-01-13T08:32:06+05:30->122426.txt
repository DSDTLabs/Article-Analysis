MUMBAI: A day after it came to light that  , ex-secretary of the  , had called  , president of the   (ECB), to inform him about the Indian board's 'inability' to host England for the one-day and T20 series starting this week, the Pune-based businessman admitted he did so and had 'nothing to hide.' "Giles is a friend and we keep talking on a regular basis. In the middle of all that is happening, I just spoke with him what was on my mind. Don't people speak with friends?" Shirke asked.

 The ex-president of the   (MCA) said despite being eligible for a UK passport, he had decided against applying for it only because he had responsibilities as secretary of the BCCI. "Now, since I'm no longer the secretary, I am applying for it next week," he said.
 
 Speaking about his conversation with Clarke, Shirke said, "What if he called me and said 'Ajay, there's so much happening with regards to cricket administration in India, especially ahead of England arriving here, why didn't you tell me?', then what would I tell him?" Shirke forwarded a text message to TOI on Thursday which he said he had written to Clarke post the call he made to the ECB chief. "Morning Giles. Further to my call, BCCI has got its act together and the interim arrangements seem to have settled down well. Thus, I see no difficulties that the English lads may face for the tour. I will meet you when I am back in London, which should be very soon," the message read.
 
 To this, Clarke replied: "Thanks Ajay. Catch up in London."
 
 "And now I am busy helping the MCA conduct the match smoothly in Pune," Shirke added. The first ODI is on January 15 in Pune.
 
 The exchange of messages now makes it very clear that Shirke indeed called Clarke to talk about the one-day and T20 series. Now, it is up to the Supreme Court of India to decide whether this 'friendly chat' between Shirke and Clarke would amount to contempt.
