LUCKNOW: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)   MP   on Saturday targeted ruling   and accused it of raking up non-issues to hide its own failures in governance at Centre and in the state. 

 
  Hitting out at BJP and RSS, Singh said that an unnecessary row was being created over Mohammad Ali  's portrait in Aligarh Muslim university (AMU) because they want to take focus away from the real issues of unemployment, farmers' hardships, bank defaulters etc.. 
 
 Addressing the media in Lucknow, Singh demanded that perpetrators behind AMU violence be caught and strict action be taken against them. He also demanded probe over lapse in security of former vice-president   at AMU. 
 
 "Nobody in India supports Jinnah and I believe whoever does so is supporting the enemy, but the BJP and RSS, whose leaders sat in Jinnah's lap, have no right to comment. For the next fortnight, Jinnah will be brought back from the grave and real issues will be sidelined," he said. 
 
 To back his claim, Singh presented an excerpt from a letter allegedly written by RSS leader Shyama Prasad Mookerjee to a British Governor in 1942, at the time of Mahatma Gandhi's Quit India Movement.
