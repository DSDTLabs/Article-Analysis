KOLKATA: Monsoon hit   on Tuesday and could reach Kolkata and south   by June 10, which is monsoon’s normal date of arrival in Bengal, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre ( ). Though there are no reasons to slow down the monsoon currents, weathermen are keeping their fingers crossed till the rains hit the   and north Bengal over the next three days. Kolkata, however, could receive a thundershower on Thursday.

 
 The four northeastern states of Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura could receive monsoon within the next 72 hours, according to RMC director  . “North Bengal would be the next to receive the rains after the four states. Once these areas are covered, we can be sure the currents are on course and will hit Kolkata by June 10. So far, there is no system in sight that could stall the currents,” said Das.
 
 While the city has remained humid and dry over the last 10 days with maximum temperature sailing past 35° C, the scorching spell might be broken on Thursday. “The south Bengal districts have been receiving thundershowers quite regularly even this week. But Kolkata has been dry. Conditions are slowly turning favourable for a thunderstorm in Kolkata now and we expect one on Thursday,” said Das.
 
 The Met office, however, pointed out that this may not be the last thunderstorm before the monsoon arrives. If conditions turn favourable before the arrival of rains, there could be more. “So far, our region has been dry so thundershowers remain a possibility. We will know better once the monsoon hits the region,” said a Met official.
 
 While monsoon currents are ‘exceptionally strong’ this year, there are factors that could still come in the way. The three major factors that influence the progress of monsoon currents are crossequitorial flow of wind, lowpressure situation and the heat condition in north-west India. “If this conditions remains favourable, like they are at the moment, the currents should advance fast,” said a Met official.
