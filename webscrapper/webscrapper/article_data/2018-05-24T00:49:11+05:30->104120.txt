NEW DELHI: The   on Wednesday refused to allow a second year law student of   to appear at the fourth semester examination for which she was barred by the university for being short of attendance due to pregnancy. 

 The student, Ankita Meena, had an attendance of 49% in the fourth semester against the minimum requirement of 70% as per rules framed by  . She missed classes for almost two months of the semester due to her pregnancy and birth of her child in  . She had first moved the   which refused her plea and later challenged the HC order in the apex court.
 
 As one of the papers was scheduled for 2 pm on Wednesday, she was running against time to get the SC’s nod for appearing in the examination. Noting that it was too late for the court to interfere as any order passed by it could not be enforced by the university at such short notice, a vacation bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Navin Sinha refused to grant her relief.
 
 The court also said the student was at fault for not having informed the university about her pregnancy, requesting for maternity leave or concession.
 
 “We cannot come to your aid as you have not even applied for maternity leave,” the bench said. The counsel, appearing for Meena, contended that the HC had allowed other similarly placed students to take examination and pleaded the court to allow her also to take exam.
 
 “We are not very comfortable with the idea that the Supreme Court passes order at 1 pm to allow a candidate to sit in examination at 2 pm. Discipline of academics is lost in the process and we cannot interfere in the examination process,” the bench said asking the petitioner to argue before the HC on the legality of the rule not allowing any concession on attendance to pregnant students. 
 
 As per Rule 12 of   of the Bar Council of India, a mandatory attendance of 70% in each semester of LLB was required and a student is barred from taking exam for short of attendance.
