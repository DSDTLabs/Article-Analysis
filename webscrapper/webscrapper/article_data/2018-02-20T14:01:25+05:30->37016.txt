Mumbai: Shares of banks exposed to the Nirav Modi fraud fell sharply as more lenders disclosed exposure and the   denied having asked   to honour its guarantees to offshore branches in respect of unauthorised transactions. PNB shares continued to be hammered with the scrip closing 7.4% lower at Rs 116 on Monday. Union Bank was the next big loser, falling 7.2% to Rs 110. Bank of Baroda slipped 5.5% to Rs 144, and UCO Bank also dropped 5.5% to Rs 27. Bank of India also lost over 4% to close at Rs 125.

 The public sector banks (PSBs) dragged down the market and key indices on Monday. The   fell 236 points to close at 33,775. Since the PNB fraud was disclosed, investors in bank shares have lost nearly Rs 68,000 crore in market capitalisation, of which almost Rs 49,000 crore has been lost in PSU banks. 
 
 One of the worst hit by the fall in the value of PSB shares will be the LIC, which has significant holdings in most of the PSU lenders.
  
 
 Banks are staring at mammoth provisions in the fourth quarter results following the fraud where Modi’s and Mehul Choksi’s group companies managed to raise over Rs 11,300 crore by producing letters of undertakings ( ) fraudulently obtained from PNB. Banks are locked in a dispute over who will bear the loss.
 
 Following the fall in share prices on Monday, the collective value of 21 PSBs — including SBI — stands at about Rs 4.3 lakh crore, which is Rs 59,000 crore lower than HDFC Bank’s nearly Rs 4.9-lakh-crore market capitalisation. PSB shares have been beaten so badly that even a small regional lender like City Union Bank has a market capitalisation of Rs 11,541 crore, which is higher than a large pan-Indian nationalised bank like Union Bank (Rs 9,396 crore).
 
 The recently licenced AU Small Finance Bank has a market capitalisation of Rs 16,355 crore, which is higher than that of Indian Bank — one of the large banks in South India. BNP Paribas Mutual Fund senior equity fund manager Karthikraj Lakshmanan said, “The domestic market continued to fall despite positive global cues led by weakness in shares of public sector banks. During the day, the Nifty PSU bank index was down by nearly 4% and hit a 52-week low of 2,982 points.”
