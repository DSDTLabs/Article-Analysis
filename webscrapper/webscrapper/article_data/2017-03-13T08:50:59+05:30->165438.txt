ROHTAK: Overjoyed over BJP’s win in Uttar Pradesh,   finance minister Captain Abhimanyu on Sunday took on Jat leader  , whom he had earlier called a social activist. Malik, who is leading the agitation of the Jat community in Haryana, had been maintaining that   in western UP would not vote for the BJP in support of Jats here.

 “The UP elections have exposed Yashpal Malik. He has no place to even hide his face,” an elated Abhimanyu said in a press conference here on Sunday. He further said that, “He is only trying to divide society. Almost 90% of votes for the BJP came from the farming community, who have reposed their trust in Prime Minister  .”
 
 On the ongoing standoff with the Jat community over reservation, the finance minister said the government was ready to hold dialogue with the protesting community. “But certain elements were prevailing upon the community to not reach a peaceful solution,” he said.
 
 The minister maintained that the aim for his government was to find out the conspirators behind the large-scale violence in February 2016. “Who were the people that started 35 versus 1 slogans to create a divide? Who were behind the arson? Out government is committed to taking them to task,” he claimed.
