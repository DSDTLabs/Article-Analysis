NEW DELHI: Everyone dreads a   announcement regarding a new tax or cess, and this one, if it goes through will get your goat. A suggestion made by the department of financial services to the government last year may lead to the introduction of a new fee or cess on digital payments. The idea behind this is to create a fund to battle the growing number of cases of   in digital payments. 
  
In 2017, a total of 25,817 cases of credit and debit card fraud, and those involving internet banking were reported.
 
 Won’t a new cess on digital transactions prove to be counter productive to the government’s Digital India initiative? That’s a call   Arun Jaitley has to take. Question is will he bite?
