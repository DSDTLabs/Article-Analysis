MUMBAI: The government-owned   has been placed under watch by the RBI following a surge in bad loans. With several public sector banks set to announce their second year of losses, there is likelihood that more banks may join the watch list.

 In a statement issued to the stock exchanges, IDBI Bank said that the central bank has initiated prompt corrective action (PCA) for the bank in view of 'high net non-performing assets and negative return on assets'. 
 
 "The action will not have any material impact on the performance of the bank and will contribute to improving the internal controls of the bank and improvement in its activities," the bank said. In the past, the RBI had initiated PCA against Indian Overseas Bank and United Bank of India. Banks come under   if their net non-performing assets rise over 6%, they report losses for two years in succession and their capital adequacy is below statutory level.
 
 IDBI Bank will now have to take measures to conserve capital as further weakening of its capital base or refusal of the government to infuse capital would make it a candidate for merger. Conserving capital would involve curbs on lending, fresh hiring and new investments. The RBI's decision comes close on the heels of the government replacing the bank's CEO by swapping the chief executive's positions in IDBI Bank and Indian Bank. Last month, M K Jain was moved from   to IDBI Bank while Kishor Kharat was shifted from IDBI Bank to Indian Bank.
 
 While revising its  , the RBI had said that if a bank's common equity tier-I capital falls below the threshold of 3.625%, the bank could either be amalgamated or merged or taken over by another entity.
