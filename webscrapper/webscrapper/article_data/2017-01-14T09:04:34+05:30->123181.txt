MADURAI: In order to ensure hassle-free tax payment,   on Friday introduced payment facility with credit and debit cards. The facility will be available at all the 41 tax collection centres across the city. The corporation has taken the decision after the demonetisation drive hit the residents hard. Many found it difficult to pay the tax in cash as it had become scarce. Corporation collects tax on various heads including property, house, water and professional.

 Welcoming the move, residents said it would help them sort out issues like finding the right change for the payment. A section of the people said that this could have been done earlier, as it would have helped in a big way when the cash crunch was at its peak. "This is a long pending demand from the people. Carrying exact change for payment is not possible. This will address such issues," said V K Velmurugan, a resident of Tahsildar Nagar. 
 
 The facility was introduced at   tax collection centre by minister for cooperation   in the presence of corporation commissioner Sandeep Nanduri.
 
 An official from the accounts department said the facility has been introduced in line with Prime Minister  's vision of cashless economy and transparent administration. It is helpful not only for tax payers but also for the staff who collect the payments. At the end of the day, the cash collected is taken to banks. Now, the staff will not be needed to carry the "hefty amounts".
 
 The official also said that, "after demonetisation, it has become difficult for people to carry much cash on them. This was introduced in order to fulfil their demand of paying by electronic mode. Although we expect only a few people to use the service to start with, soon, many taxpayers will get adapted to the system. "
