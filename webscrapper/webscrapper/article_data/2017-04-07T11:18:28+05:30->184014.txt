NASHIK: The three-month extension to 5%   benefit to onion under the   (MEIS) will  , hope farmers and exporters. 

 The government had introduced the MEIS of 5% for export of onions 'fresh or chilled' with effect from August 26, 2016. The scheme was valid up to December 31, but the government extended it up to March 31, 2017. After demands from exporters and the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee, the Centre has again extended the scheme benefits till June 30. 
 
 "We had urged the government to extend the scheme for another few months. The extension will definitely help boost onion exports," said Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon APMC.
 
 "At present, there is huge arrival of onions at Lasalgaon APMC. Hence, there is a need to increase the exports. The extension to % MEIS benefits will help stabilise prices," he added. 
 
 Nivrutti Nyaharkar, Nashik divisional president of the Jai Kisan Farmers' Forum, said, "The cost of growing onions is around Rs 1,000 per quintal and farmers incur losses when the prices go below that. Currently, the average wholesale prices of onions have declined to Rs 450 to Rs 500 per quintal and farmers are incurring huge losses."
 
 Nyaharkar said, "Extending the MEIS benefit is a good move to boost exports and stabilise prices, but it will not be enough. The government need to give a grant of Rs 1,5000 per quintal on onions if it really wants the survival of onion farmers."
