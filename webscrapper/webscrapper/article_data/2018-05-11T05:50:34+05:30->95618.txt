GUWAHATI/SHILLONG: The   (Amendment) Bill, 2016 — proposing citizenship to religious minorities fleeing Bangladesh, Pakistan and   because of persecution — has run into opposition in the Northeast.

 
 While Assam’s BJP government wants a Joint Parliamentary Committee currently touring the region to hold public hearings to defer submission of its report until the state publishes the final draft of the updated   ( ), Meghalaya’s cabinet, of which BJP is a constituent, has come out against it.
 
 “The JPC should gauge the situation after the NRC is published, when we will know how many illegal migrants from each religious community are living in  ,” a source said, adding “The state would also want to wait for the NRC before taking its stand.”
 
 Meghalaya deputy CM Prestone Tynsong said: “We don’t support the proposed amendment bill. Just because we are NDA partners does not mean we have to sacrifice the interests of people for an amendment that does not suit larger good of state.”
