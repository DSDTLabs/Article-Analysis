PATNA: Union minister of state for drinking water and   S S Ahluwalia on Thursday said as merely 32.5% of rural households in Bihar are covered by toilets, the state government would have to make all out efforts to achieve 100% coverage by December 31 next year.

 Ahluwalia, who reviewed the performance of the state public health and engineering department (PHED) in covering rural households with toilets, said the national average is 67%. “Clearly, Bihar’s performance is much below the national average,” he added. “The state government would have to ensure construction of 25,000 toiles per day to achieve the target in sync with open defecation free (ODF) society and nation by October 2, 2019, when the country would be celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi,” Ahluwalia said.
 
 He said considering floods and no work during monsoon for three months, the rate of construction of toilets for Bihar was revised and lowered to 7,000 toilets per day over the next 270 days to cover 1.40 crore rural households. For UP, the construction target is 9,000 toilets per day,” Ahluwalia added.
 
 Ahluwalia, who was accompanied by Bihar PHED minister Vinod Narayan Jha and state BJP chief Nityanand Rai, said 192 districts in the country have already been declared ODF, but in Bihar only some villages, blocks and parts of districts enjoy this status. He hoped that the state government would be able to achieve the target by expediting the work.
 
 “Over one lakh children die per year in the country due to diarrhoea caused by water contamination as a result of open defecation,” Ahluwalia said citing a report prepared by the Unicef. He said the PHED has prepared a “viable plan” of providing safe drinking water through piped water system to all the arsenic and fluoride affected villages in the state.
