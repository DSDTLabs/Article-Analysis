KOLKATA: body may extend the last date for the switchover till April 30, sources in the   assessment department said on Wednesday. Mayor   confirmed that the civic body is mulling an extension. “It is true that we need to extend the   deadline. We will definitely announce it shortly,”   said on Wednesday.

 The new extension, if cleared, will come with riders though. First, the civic assessment department will reserve the right for suo motu assessment of properties if the owners fail to do so within the stipulated time. Second, the civic body may impose penalty on owners of residential buildings, flats or commercial offices who fails to take the opportunity of such an extension, said a KMC revenue department official. The civic brass now wants to incorporate the penal provision to make a section of tax payers fall in line.
 
  
  
 
 However, a section of KMC senior officials has suggested to offer basic minimum infrastructure to tax-payers before taking penal measures. “We need to deploy tax preparators in all borough offices to offer tax-payers help in filling up the self-assessment forms that are really complex in nature for them to understand. These preparators will do the job in lieu of some fee, which will be fixed by the civic body,” a KMC assessment department official said. This apart, the KMC revenue department will send inspectors to housing complexes to distribute self-assessment forms and train tax-payers for a smooth switch.
 
 A KMC revenue department official conceded that the help desks set up earlier at every borough to help property owners fill up the SAF forms had attracted many tax payers last year. “Now there is hardly any such desks at the borough level. We need to reopen such desks to meet the deadline,” a KMC revenue department official said on Wednesday.
