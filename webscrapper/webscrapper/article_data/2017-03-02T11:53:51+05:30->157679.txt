KOLKATA: The   (DoPT) is planning to amend   (AISR) to make   (PAR) through electronic mode from this year. The department has asked all chief secretaries to share their views by March 15. 

 DoPT wants PAR to be made electronically, but it can be done in writing with its approval. But political executives can record their comments manually. 
 
 For example, a joint secretary in the home department said that his reporting authority was home secretary and the reviewing authority was the chief secretary while the accepting authority was the CM. As she heads the home department, the CM can write it while others need to put it electronically.
