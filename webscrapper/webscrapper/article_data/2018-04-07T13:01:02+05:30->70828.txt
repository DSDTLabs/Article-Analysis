Despite knowing all the requisites of a healthy lifestyle, we still fail to achieve a disease-free life . An analysis of the data collected by SRL Diagnostics also showed a worrisome trend. Dr B.R Das, Advisor and Mentor - R&D, SRL Diagnostics shared, "We have noticed an alarming level of Vitamin D inadequacy in the country. And this finding is in sync with the findings of other medical research studies conducted in the country earlier. Of the total samples analysed, 79.12 per cent had either Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency. While women were more commonly Vitamin D insufficient, men showed more cases of Vitamin D deficiency. Similarly, an analysis of Kidney Function Test results showed that 10.40 per cent had abnormal values of Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Serum Creatinine or both. The results also showed that there was a rapid rise in abnormal KFT values in the ages above 60 years." 

 The analysis of Lipid Profile results meanwhile indicated that 34 per cent of the population had abnormal values for one or more of the four parameters - HDL, Triglycerides, LDL and Total Cholesterol. While men have more deranged LDL, HDL and Triglyceride levels than women, on an average the total Cholesterol level was found to be higher in women. Another worrisome trend came from the analysis of glucose tests, which are conducted to establish the inability to process sugars correctly â€“ precursor to diabetes. In pan India analysis on samples received mainly from urban areas, 19.22 per cent of individuals were observed to be either pre-diabetic or diabetic, with men accounting for 20.80 per cent and women, 17.36 per cent.
