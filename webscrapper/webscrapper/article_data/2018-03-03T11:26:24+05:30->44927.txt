PANAJI: Strongly opposing the decision to send an all-party delegation to the central government seeking relief in the   crisis,   (AAP) on Friday said that the political parties seem to be carrying a brief of the select few who have been enjoying the mining wealth for long, as a payback for the funding they have been receiving for their political careers.

 In a statement, AAP’s   called the "all-party delegation" which is scheduled to meet Union minister for mines   and Union minister for shipping   “as yet another instance of deep level of friendship between the BJP, Congress and allliance parties to sell the interest of the state to favour a few at the cost of the common man”.
 
 AAP alleged that a few MLAs of both parties whose stakes in the mining business is no secret are grouping together in the name of all-party meet.
 
 The party demanded that this delegation first spell out their course of dialogue with the people of the state who have a right to know what will be discussed and what will be the advantages/disadvantages of such a move, said Karapurkar
