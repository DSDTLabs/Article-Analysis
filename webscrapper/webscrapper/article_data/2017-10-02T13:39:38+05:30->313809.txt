MUSSOORIE: On a quiet sunny afternoon in 2010, veteran stage and film actor   had sat in protest against the “death of a dear old friend” – the iconic Clock Tower in Mussoorie that was built in the 1930s and demolished by the civic authorities. In a similar replay of scenes, on Sunday, local residents, including some of his close friends, held prayer meetings for the actor, who passed away on Friday night after battling a relapse of skin cancer, across the town. Many fought back tears, finding it hard to belief that their “blue-eyed boy” is no more. Family sources said that a memorial service for the late actor will also be held on October 7 at the St Paul’s Church in Landour where the actor married   in 1977.
 
  Sanjay Mark, Alter’s friend for more than 50 years and also his junior at Woodstock School, said, “It was a Christian wedding but with a pahadi touch to it. We danced our way to the church to pahadi songs.”
  
  “I will remember Alter as a brilliant writer and someone having impeccable oratorical skills. When he made his mark in Bollywood, it was a proud moment for all of us. He had also played an important part in the   movement,” said Jai Prakash Uttarakhandi, a historian.
  
  Mussoorie was close to Alter’s heart. The actor had spent his formative years in Mussoorie, where he was born and which he regarded as his home town, and Dehradun. He was known to often take long walks from Dehradun to Mussoorie. A cricket enthusiast, Alter was also the captain in the tennis football teams at the Woodstock School, where he studied.
  
  “He was a true sportsman and wanted to have a stadium here,” recalled Roop Chand, convenor, Mussoorie   Association. Chand’s elder brother was Alter’s close friend.
  
  It comes as hardly surprising what Alter had said to this reporter during the Mussoorie Winterline Carnival in 2013: “Mussoorie is a part of my soul. So, when I perform here, the feeling is all the more special.”
