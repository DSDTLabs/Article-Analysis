Now, that’s a way to whet your appetite and also protest! With the Central government introducing a ban on sale of cow, buffalo and ox for slaughter,  , the highest consumer of beef in the country, will be the most affected.

 However, the people in the State are not taking the “indirect ban” lying down and those from the film industry have even got a meaty reply.   Thomas’ latest movie   takes a jibe at the recent changes in policy, by showing what beef means to the people of Kerala and judging from the popularity of the scene, which has gone viral, it truly mirrors the majority’s view. 
 
 The scene has Tovino’s character Anjaneya Das explaining to his Tamil college mate what the combination of beef and   means to the people of Kerala. “It’s not just food but a feeling,” he says, before he begins to describe the process of making beef fry and serving it with parotta. Just like his buddy in the scene, we are sure it will make many drool.
