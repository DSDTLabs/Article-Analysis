CHENNAI: The idol wing CID is looking into the hiving off of 5.75kg gold from the Somaskandar idol at Ekambaranathar temple in Kancheepuram on Tuesday. 

 According to investigating officials, the misappropriation was done during the consecration of the idol.
 
 "There is not even an ounce of gold in the statue. We had reviewed it with the help of positive metal identification (PMI) analysis. The statue was supposed to contain at least 5.75 kg gold," said DSP Raghupathy.
 
 A district court had directed the idol wing to investigate the case after a devotee filed a petition. The idol wing, headed by IG A G Ponmanickavel, had earlier registered an FIR against nine people including the temple executive officer Murugesan, Tamil Nadu chief temple sthapathi M  , sculptor Masilamani and temple priest Rajappa in connection with this case.
 
 The statue was made in   on the orders of the   board in 2015, police said.   said the investigation is in the preliminary stages but devotees suspect misappropriation as temple officials have allegedly failed to keep account of the gold collected for two pancha loha idols from devotees.
 
 Police are also investigating how 1,300-year-old pancha loha armours of the Somaskandar idol went missing.
 
 Police said the temple authority had decided to redo the panchaloha idol of Somaskandar, comprising Lord Shiva, Paravathi and Murugan, weighing around 50kg and an amman idol. As per the order, the temple executive officer asked the devotees to donate gold for the idols of   and amman. However, they never kept any inventory of the gold collected alleging which a devotee moved the court suspecting fraud, a senior police officer said.
