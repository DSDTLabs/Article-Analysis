New Delhi: Days after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal   his   over the   in the city, the   on Monday expressed   over politicians and   staging protests and dharna against the court-monitored action taken against unauthorised constructions and misuse of residential premises for commercial purposes

 Kejriwal had announced last month that he would sit on fast if the ongoing drive was not stopped by March 31. But a day before he was to go on fast, AAP’s Delhi unit said the CM had deferred his hunger strike
 
 As the Centre and senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, pleaded the court to defer the hearing for a week, a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta said the matter needed to be adjudicated at the earliest as “everyone is going on strike and dharna”.
 
 “There is a complete breakdown of law and order in the city. Assure us that that people would not go on dharna,” the bench told additional solicitor general A N S Nadkarni who was appearing for the Centre.
 
 Facing a barrage of questions, Nadkarni sought some time to reply to the queries raised by the court. But the bench said it was not in favour of adjourning the case and hearing will resume on Tuesday.
