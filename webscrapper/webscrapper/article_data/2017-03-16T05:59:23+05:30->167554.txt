Gurgaon: Worried about their future,   employees took to the street on Wednesday to protest against the formation of proposed Gurgaon Metropolitan Development Authority ( ). They threatened to go on an indefinite strike if the state government went ahead with its plan to form a new urban development body by ‘diluting the powers’ of four-decade-old Huda.

 Agitating under the banner of Huda Karmachari Ekta Union at the Huda office in Sector 14, the employees blamed wrong policies of the state government for the present condition of Huda.
 
 “Till 2014-15, Huda was financially in a good shape and employees were given performance bonus. But within a year (2016-17), Huda ran into a  ,” said Umed Singh, chairperson of Huda Karmachari Ekta Union. He said that they wanted to know the reasons behind the financial crisis.
 
 “Huda was created way back in 1977. But till date, it has no balance sheet; there is no proper record of money collected and spent by the department,” alleged Singh. “The government should take immediate steps to prepare a balance sheet of the department and take action against officials responsible (for not maintaining account details).”
 
 Huda has carried out numerous development projects in urban areas in the past 40 years. Yet, the government is planning to dilute this department for forming a new body.
 
 “We are against any move that may dilute the powers of Huda. Instead of creating a new department, the government should strengthen Huda. And, employees’ unions should be taken into confidence while making any decision in this regard,” said  , a member of the union.
 
 Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav said: “We held a meeting with union members this afternoon and promised to address their grievances.”
