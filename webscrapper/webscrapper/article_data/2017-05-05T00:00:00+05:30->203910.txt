Bijibal weaves magic with his tunes yet again. 

 Yes, after repeated listens you might feel that all three songs are very similar tune-wise with different rhythmic patterns, but the light-music style treatment and their tenderness can hook you. 
 
 Akale Oru Kaadinte by Shreya Ghoshal is a slow melody about embracing life with a smile. Itâ€™s that kind of a song you would want to hum to yourself when happy about the simple pleasures of life. And undoubtedly, the soulful voice of Shreya takes the song a few notches high. Going by the teasers and trailer of the film, one also feels that the first two breezy lines of the song sums up, rather poetically, what the movie might be all about. 
 
 The second song Kavitha Ezhuthunnu is sung by Sooraj Santhosh and it reminds you of how a poet might feel when in an overwhelmingly romantic, happy mood. The Peelithumbu Kondu Kaalam portion that repeats adds a lot of zing to the compositions. The soft and supple singing catapults it to the numero uno song of the album. 
 
 Maavilakudil by Rajalakshmi starts off with a pleasant humming. The lyrics are fresh, and and the singer infuses the apt feel into it through her honey-soaked rendition. The album is a right pick if you want to stay blissfully ignorant of the mad, mad world around you and just relax.
