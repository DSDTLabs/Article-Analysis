Vasco: Mormugao Municipal Council (MMC) on Tuesday sealed six shops in Vasco, including grocery stores and cyber cafes, for operating without trade licences. Two of the shops are in Baina and four in the Vasco market. The shop owners have been asked to renew their licences. The council has started cracking down on commercial establishments operating either without obtaining trade licences or with expired licenses. MMC chief officer Johnson Fernandes, who holds additional charge of Vasco, said, “Since taking charge last Friday, I have issued orders that shops operating without proper permissions be sealed. I have also requested home owners to pay their house tax on time so it doesn’t go into arrears.”
