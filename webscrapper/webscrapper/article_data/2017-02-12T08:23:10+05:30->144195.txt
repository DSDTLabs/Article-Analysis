BATHINDA: Hundreds of Congress workers led by former MLA and party candidate from Rampura Phool assembly constituency Gurpreet Singh Kangar held a protest at Bhairupa village in Bathinda on Saturday and demanded strict action against those responsible for insulting a baptised Sikh, Dharam Singh, and policemen involved in shooting a video, where he was made to strip in their presence. 

 The clip of the Bhairupa resident and Congress activist Dharam Singh was prepared at Phool police station on November 17, 2015, when he was arrested for protesting against rural development minister   in the aftermath of acts of sacrilege in Punjab. Earlier this week, that video clip came to light after 15 months and three cops, including  , were placed under suspension on Thursday.
 
 Congress workers, however, are demanding action against persons who shot the video, apart from the errant policemen. 
 
 Kangar alleged that, “Congress activist Dharam Singh is a baptised Sikh. He, along with others, was only showcasing his anger against the SAD-BJP government for having failed in solving various cases of desecration of Guru  . Some unidentified persons supported by police insulted him in the police station and prepared the video clip. We suspect that some SAD members considered close to Maluka could be involved in the act as some voices in the backgrond can be heard in the video clip. We want the persons responsible for the incident be brought to book and policemen should be dismissed from service.”
 
 Bathinda SSP Swapan Sharma said   Jai Singh and head constables Ram Singh and   had been already placed under suspension in this regard. “A special branch of the district police has been directed to thoroughly investigate the matter and submit a report in five days about those who shot the video clip. Accordingly, action will be taken soon.”
