NAGPUR:   has finally paid the amount for getting 106 acres of land in the Mihan-SEZ. The company had announced its plans to have a unit in the SEZ during ground breaking ceremony of its food park coming up in Mihan’s   area.

 The cheque handed over by Baba Ramdev for the SEZ land, during the ceremony however was dishonoured twice. It was because Patanjali had issued stop payment instructions to its bankers following issues related to approval to its SEZ project. With the unit approval given last month, Patanjali has finally cleared the dues recently. TOI had earlier reported about the cheque being dishonoured.
 
 Suresh Kakani, who last month took over as vice-chairman-cum-managing director of (VC-MD), of Mihan confirmed the development. He said Patanjali has two land parcels in Mihan and payment for both has been done. 
 
 The unit approval committee ( ), under the development commissioner’s office of Mihan, had held up the permission on the grounds that there was no proper wall demarcating Patanjali’s SEZ and non-SEZ lands. The company had issued stop payment orders after that. It has now constructed the wall and secured the approval.
 
 Patanjali plans to eye markets in the US and Europe through the products made in Mihan-SEZ. Acharya Balkrishana the managing director told TOI that the company would be making herbal cosmetics and medicines for which approvals will be taken from the   and similar agencies in the Europe.
