Nashik: The Shiv Sena on Monday alleged that memorials of great personalities in the city, which are maintained by the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), are in neglected condition. 

 “None of the memorials are maintained. These memorials were built as a tribute to great people. It is the duty of the NMC to maintain it,” said city chief of Shiv Sena and leader of the opposition in the NMC, Ajay Boraste.
 
 He named a few memorials and sites that are not maintained — Vasant Kanetkar Udyan, Savarkar Smarak, Dadasaheb Phalke Smarak, Bal Thackeray  . 
 
 Apart from these, the recently built memorial is the Itihaas Sangrahalay. It is dedicated to Bal Thackeray. The memorial was inaugurated by historian Babasaheb Purandare in January 2017 in presence of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray.
 
 The memorial at Gangapur Road has a museum with paintings by senior artist Vasudev Kamat, depicting scenes of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s era. Weapons from Shivaji’s era donated by Purandare are also on display at the museum. But the memorial has very few visitors. 
 
 Kanetkar Udyan and Phalke Smarak are also in a shambles and the Sena has been demanding that these gardens be renovated and maintained.
 
 “Many people are not even aware that a garden called Kanetkar Udyan exists in the city. The latest is the Itihaas Sangrahalay in memory of Bal Thackeray. But when I visited last week and inquired about it, I learnt that there are not many visitors. This memorial should be publicised. Why build memorials when these cannot be maintained?” said Rahul Patil, an engineer, and his cousin Jitendra Patil. 
 
 Boraste said that the Shiv Sena will soon be raising the issue of poor maintenance of the memorials and gardens with the civic administration.
