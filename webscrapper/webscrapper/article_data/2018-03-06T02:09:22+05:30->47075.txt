MUMBAI: Nearly 40 days after   resident   died after being pulled into an MRI machine at  , the BMC said on Monday that the probe is likely to take another 7-10 days. 

 Last week, deputy municipal commissioner (public health) Sunil   had said the inquiry was complete and the report handed over to additional municipal commissioner IS Kundan. On Monday however, Kundan told TOI that several important aspects in the case were still to be probed. "I am yet to see the report, but the findings in its present form, are not complete," she said. The probe is likely to be handed over to deputy municipal commissioner   who currently holds Dhamne's charge. 
 
 On January 27, Maru died after getting sucked into an MRI machine along with an oxygen cylinder he allegedly carried into the MRI room for his ailing relative. 
 
 Nair Hospital dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal had previously confirmed to TOI that all the employees had resumed work. "Till the inquiry report finds them guilty, we can't keep them away," he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, Nair hospital authorities are contemplating whether to fix the now-defunct machine at a cost of Rs 85 lakh or procure a new one. Every day, more than 25 patients who need an MRI at Nair, are referred to other hospitals. TNN
