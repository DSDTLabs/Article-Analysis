MUMBAI:   spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala on Sunday asked chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and   chief Uddhav Thackeray to give a commitment to Mumbaikars that after elections, they will not join hands to grab power and share spoils after promising a divorce.

 “In view of rampant corruption as confirmed by the CM, the people of Mumbai will dislodge the unholy Sena-BJP alliance and vote the Congress to power. We expect that since the Shiv Sena has terminated its alliance, it will benefit the Congress. We get 100 in the House of 227,” Surjewala said.
 
 Surjewala said while Mumbai pays over Rs two lakh crore as income tax to the Centre, BMC’s annual budget is Rs 37,052 crore and Rs 51,000 crore in fixed deposits, yet for the last 20 years there is unparalleled malgovernance and unimaginable corruption by the Sena-BJP. “The maladministration can be described as crumbling infrastructure, crushing public services and collapsing urban development. Since   is associated with Shiv Sena, Fadnavis can not escape his responsibility,” he said.
 
 Surjewala alleged Mumbai had become the crime capital for women and children.
