MALDA:   on Thursday spoke to the wife of poll official  , whose mutilated body was found on railway tracks near Raiganj on Tuesday. The officers also collected the mobile of Ray’s wife Arpita in which she last spoke to her husband around 7:45pm on Monday.

 A three-member CID team, led by D E Lepcha, also spoke to the autopsy surgeon who conducted the post-mortem at Raiganj Hospital.
 
 In Kolkata, chief minister   termed the death unfortunate. The circumstances of the case point to the fact that he was run over, she indicated. “He had a headache and therefore could not complete the poll process. He had to be replaced by another official, a decision entirely taken at the discretion of the SEC. After we recovered the body, we came to know that the train driver had reported about a knock-down at the very next station near the spot where he was hit. Nevertheless, we have decided to stand by the family. We have also asked for a CID probe,” she said.
 
 “We have collected the names of other polling officials whose statements are being recorded. We are looking for some locals who can tell us where he was headed to after suffering a headache,” a CID officer said. Roy’s body was found about 20 kilometres from the Itahar booth where he was on duty till 4pm on Monday.
 
 At home, Arpita, along with her two children and old mother, are spending sleepless hours. Nardip Ray, a relative of Arpita, said, “We have been waiting outside the hospital since Wednesday. Neither were we handed over the post mortem report nor the body of Rajkumar.” Arpita said: “We want punishment of the culprits and a CBI probe.” Hundreds of teachers on Thursday took out a silent rally at Raiganj in protest of Ray’s death.
