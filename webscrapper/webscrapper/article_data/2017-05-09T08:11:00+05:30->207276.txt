GURGAON: A nine-year-old girl was raped allegedly by a 40-year-old neighbour in the upscale DLF-II area in the early hours of Sunday, police said on Monday. 

 A driver, who is working for a businessman, Jogender was caught in the act by the minor’s father and brothers, who later handed him over to police. Jogender, who hails from Chapra in Bihar, was produced before a local court, which remanded him in judicial custody on Monday.
 
 Police said the girl is living with her parents, who are from  , in a rented accommodation in L-block of DLF-II where her father worked as a cook. Jogender lived alone the next door.
 
 A preliminary probe revealed that the girl had gone to sleep on the rooftop on Saturday night while her father and two brothers were inside the house. Her mother had gone to a relative’s place.
 
 Around 4am, the girl came down from the terrace alone, apparently to go to toilet, when Jogender pounced on her. He dragged her to his room before raping her, according to police. The girl somehow managed to raise an alarm, prompting her brothers and father to rush for her rescue. Jogender, though tried to flee the spot, was captured by the girl’s father and local people.
 
 Acting on the complaint of her father, police sent the girl for a medical examination, which confirmed rape. Later, an FIR was registered under Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act at the   police station. 
 
 Women police station SHO inspector Kailash Devi said the accused had confessed to his crime. “In her statement, the girl also said that the man had molested her on several occasions in the past. But she did not tell anyone as he had threatened to kill her,” the SHO said.
