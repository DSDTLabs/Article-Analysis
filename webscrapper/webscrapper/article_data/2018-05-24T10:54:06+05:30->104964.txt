CHENNAI: Greens, beans, brinjals, carrots and other garden fresh vegetable from   region will soon be available across the counter at   here. The Tamil Nadu Horticulture Development Agency has decided to add veggies to the sales counter after it made record sales of organic jams, squash, pickles sourced from Coonoor, and flower bouquets from   district, since April this year.

 “These are products that are sold only in  . People who come here for regular walks seem to like them. They go off the shelves very quickly,” said horticulture officer Shahul Hameed.
 
  harvested from the government farms in Ooty become value added items like jam, squash and pickles at the food processing unit at Sim’s Park in Coonoor. The sales counter has mixed fruit, pear, and pineapple jams, besides jars of nutmeg jelly, nutmeg and lime pickles. Bottles of pineapple, strawberry and grape squash are sold like hot cakes, as temperature has soared in the city this summer. Jams and jellys, priced between Rs 80 and Rs 180, and squash bottle which would cost between Rs 150 and Rs 180, are also popular among regular visitors.
 
 However, when most customers were asked for a feedback, they said the government must set up a veggie mart too. “It was then that authorities decided to introduce organic vegetables. It would be available on a trial basis by June. These   would come from Dindigul. We are also trying to get exotic veggies from other places,” said a senior official from the department of horticulture.
 
 They also accept prior orders for flowers like carnations, orchids, roses and others. They are then sourced from the Centre of Excellence for Cut Flowers in Krishnagiri. “We buy some flowers on a weekly basis. The price depends of the season, kind and quantity of flowers used in the bouquet. It starts from Rs 100 onwards. But they all get sold,” Hameed said.
