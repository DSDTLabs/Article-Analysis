GURUGRAM: As many as 4,000   animals have been   and   to animal   homes in last six months in  , according to animal husbandry department. This was revealed in a meeting attended by deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh and MCG officials on Friday. 

 “While 4,000 strays have already been caught, around 2,000 more are still roaming on city roads. I have asked the officials concerned to increase the number of teams to catch these strays and put them in shelter   in 10 days. As per the data available, 17,175 cows have been housed in various shelters across the city,” said Singh.
 
 “Since the two cow shelters run by MCG are facing shortage of space, we are relocating some cows and bulls to a shelter near Sohna and the process to shift them will begin from Saturday. We have arranged vehicles to transport these cows and bulls, and adequate police protection will be provided,” he said. 
 
 The MCG, meanwhile, has intensified its campaign to capture stray animals. Recently, some of its employees were attacked in Nathupur by owners of the cattle they had caught. “We will increase the number of teams and also sought police protection to avert such attacks in the future. We have decided to lodge complaints against people who attack our employees,” said an MCG official.
