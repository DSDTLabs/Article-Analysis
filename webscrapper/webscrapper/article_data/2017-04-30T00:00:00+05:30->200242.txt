After taking over as the top boss of Maharashtra’s forest department,   (Head of Forest Force)   lists his agenda …

 
 
 With his long years of service in the forest department, the Head of Forest Force realises the need to build and nurture the habitat of wild animals. That is why he lists increasing the forest cover of the state as his top priority. “Our department is committed to plant 50 crore plants by 2019 and this mission began in 2016. My focus will be to ensure that we are on track and also to see that the plants survive,” he adds.
 
 
 
 Realising that various segments working for the protection of wildlife have to come on one page to ensure better implementation of conservation policies, the PCCF has a plan in place. “Soon, I will organise workshops where everyone, including the NGOs, forest official and members of   cell will interact closely to preserve our wild habitat,” he says. Ask him his views on collaring the tigers and he says, “I’m for minimum use of collars and that too for sub adults. Too much interference with nature is not good.”
 
 
 
 Since January this year, five tigers have died in   jungles, with two of them poached in the past few weeks. The new forest chief has vowed to protect the tiger with a vengeance. “I have zero tolerance towards the poachers. And I will ensure that all the rules and sections of   are followed in letter and spirit. Those who dare to play with a tiger or a wild animal’s life will face the music and will be booked under section 9 of the Act,” says he.
