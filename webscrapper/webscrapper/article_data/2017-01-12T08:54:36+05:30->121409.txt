PANAJI: In a state, where jumping a   is more of a norm than a violation of rules, many of these lights, which are supposed to act as a force multiplier are standing dysfunctional. 

 The outdated technology used in these   is impeding its repair, says the   cell of the Goa police. 
 
 “When cops are standing at the crossings, no one breaks the rule. But the traffic signals are of outdated technology. They don’t work most of the time,” said deputy SP of traffic (North) Dharmesh Angle, adding that even if the department decides to repair them, they don’t have the requisite technical ability. “We are a law enforcement agency and currently we don’t have the requisite technicians who can repair these lights. Even if we want to, the technology is so outdated that they can’t be repaired and it is better we install new signals,” Angle added. 
 
 The   has requested the installation of 53 traffic signals, 20 pedestrian signals and 73 warning blinkers. The traffic signals are to be accompanied with 262 cameras, to be installed at over 205 locations all over the state. 
 
 “The cameras would help us in catching violators. The absence of these cameras has resulted in a low number of challans being issued for jumping the traffic light. So far, installations have been completed at six locations,” he said. 
 
 The transport department has put the onus of installation of traffic signals on the traffic police themselves. 
 
 “The government has not planned to put up any traffic signals yet. We could initiate it, but there are no funds set aside for traffic signals. The job of regulating traffic is that of the traffic cell, we only have control on registration and grant of licences. Ideally, they should initiate the setting up of traffic signals in Goa.” a senior transport official told TOI.
