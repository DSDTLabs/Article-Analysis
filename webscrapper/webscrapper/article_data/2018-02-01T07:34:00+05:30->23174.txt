CHANDIGARH:   government on Wednesday decided to renotify the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) for 3,725 hectare land in   district.

 The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by chief minister  . Earlier, the PLPA notification was made for a total of 41,043 hectare land which is going to expire on February 3. Out of this, 418 hectare land was denotified during the previous SAD-BJP rule.
 
 The main reason for the delay in extending the Act was that studies were being done by   and the Punjab remote sensing centre on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court to follow a proper procedure.
 
 However, the   unit, in a press conference on Wednesday, opposed illegal forcing the PLPA on farmers in Kandi area of Mohali, allegedly in sheer disregard of the high court orders. Punjab   vice-president   and state party secretary Vineet Joshi said that the Punjab forest department in February 2003, without following proper legal process, locked 14 villages in Mohali under the PLPA and disallowed use of land for any purpose, including agriculture. The affected villagers had approached the high court, which in 2017 accepted their contentions. 
 
 The BJP leaders said that the high court had clearly stated that in February 2018, when the restrictions on the 14 villages - Siswan Choti, Badi Naggal, Majra, Pallanpur, Dhulwan, Majrian, Sanyuk, Tarapur, Mirzapur, Gaucher, Burwana, Nada and Pachchad - would lapse, the state government before issuing a fresh notification should first conduct a proper legal and scientific study to ascertain that soil erosion is taking place and the water table is falling.
