Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is closely monitoring its water resources in wake of the depleting level of water in the Narmada dam. The civic body gets 75 million litres per day (MLD) from the reservoir.

 VMC officials said that there was no concern immediately as the state government had clarified that Narmada water will be available for drinking purposes. But if the supply to the city is curtailed or stopped in the long run, it will lead to shortage. The civic body receives water from a Narmada project canal near Khanpur and has set up a filtration plant at the site.
 
 Officials said that the other sources of water including Ajwa reservoir and French wells in the Mahi river were supplying sufficient water. The city needs around 510MLD water every day and a bulk of it is supplied from the Ajwa reservoir and Mahi.
