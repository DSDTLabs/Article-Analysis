PATNA: The BJP-led NDA members on Monday created noisy scenes in the state assembly demanding transfer of   DSP Vijay Kumar for his failure to control the law and order situation in the town and subdivision and also overstaying his term of posting, that officially is only for three years.

 Prodded by leader of opposition Prem Kumar, the NDA members entered the well of the House when commercial taxes minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav said he would look into specific complaints regarding the DSP’s alleged partisan behaviour in crime control and also take appropriate action if the details were submitted to him.
 
 Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary also ruled that the transfer of the DSP cannot be announced in the House, even if the demand is made by the opposition members or any other member in the House.
 
 BJP MLA from Madhuban Rana Randhir had sought the transfer of the DSP in his supplementary to his starred question on the crime situation in Pakridayal town. In January, trader Chuman Prasad, nagar panchayat vice-president Manoj Kumar and one Subodh Paswan were killed by AK-47. Randhir said that the real culprits had not been apprehended and, as a result, ‘rangdari’ demands were being made.
