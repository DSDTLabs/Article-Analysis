I always wanted to be in front of the camera and decided to give a shot in the   industry.

 Talking about her shows, Banu says, “Allo Good Evening is about talking to callers of all age groups. I choose a trending topic for discussion and callers give their point of view. It is not a serious show, though. We also play songs in between. I have people, from the age of three to 70 years, calling me from different parts of the country. Thinam Oru Desam talks about exploring a country in each episode, and Namma Ooru Cinema is an out-and-out cinema show, where we shoot film events and talk about it.”
