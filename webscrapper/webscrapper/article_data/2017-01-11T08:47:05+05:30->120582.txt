PUNE: The   will showcase an indigenously developed lithium-ion (li-ion) battery technology for two-wheeler electric vehicles on the opening day of the four-day Symposium on  , beginning on its campus on January 18.

 The ARAI has jointly developed the technology for two wheelers with Indian Space Research Organisation’s  . “ISRO has been developing the technology for space research and we are trying to adopt it for automotive sector. We will show this on an in-use two-wheeler,” said Rashmi Urdhwareshe, director, ARAI. An existing electric vehicle fitted with a conventional lead-acid battery will be fitted with the indigenously developed li-ion battery.
 
 Li-ion batteries are the same batteries that are used in cellphones and are preferred for their compact and high performance properties. As of now, li-ion batteries are imported for electric vehicles plying in India.
 
 ARAI’s foray will mean that the technology is made locally available to manufacturers for commercial use. The adoption, however, will depend on the design of the vehicle. 
 
 Also, cost will need to be worked out which, in turn, will depend on volumes and possible government subsidies.“The basic purpose is to demonstrate the battery technology which can be picked up by manufacturers. The recharging time will go down substantially and the space needed for this will be less,” said Urdhwareshe.
