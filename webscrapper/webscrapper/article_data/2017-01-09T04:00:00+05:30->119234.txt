New Delhi:  , vice-president,   sales, of food and beverage giant   India, has resigned, close on the heels of the company’s CFO Kimsuka Narsimhan putting in her papers.

 A PepsiCo India spokesperson confirmed the development and said  , CEO & MD of   Beverages (a Tata PepsiCo JV), will take over the reins from Pota.
 
 Pota, a PepsiCo veteran for 11 years, worked across several functions at the local arm of the Purchase-based company, including developing and launching its packaged nimbu pani (lemonade) brand Nimbooz to re-launching Mountain Dew on the proposition of Darr Ke Aage Jeet Hai (Beyond Fear Lies Victory). As the PO1 (Power of One) sales head of PepsiCo India, Pota was responsible for food and beverages sales of the company. Launched by Indra Nooyi, the PO1 strategy integrates the company’s snacks and beverage divisions into a single portfolio. Narsimhan and Pota have left for personal reasons, company executives said. 
 
 India’s Rs 14,000 crore soft drink industry, which is facing a big challenge due to higher taxes and consumers shifting to healthier beverages, seems to be undergoing significant restructuring at present with PepsiCo’s rival Coke shuffling the portfolios of its senior executives in India.
 
 While Coke, which depends on fizzy drinks for around 70% of its sales, has been struggling with declining volumes in India, PepsiCo is focusing on increasing the share of good-for-you and better-for-you products in its portfolio. Around 8% of the PepsiCo India’s total sales in 2015 came from healthy products, revealed the 2016 Access to Nutrition Index.
