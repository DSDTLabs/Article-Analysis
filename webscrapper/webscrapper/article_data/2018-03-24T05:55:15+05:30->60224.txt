MUMBAI: A six-member family from   who went missing last October has been traced to Ujjain, MP, where they were hiding to escape   back home.

 Sangeeta Tiwari (33) had filed an online complaint with Arnala coastal police on October 23, alleging that her husband Varun Sharma (36) and in-laws were missing since October 15. Sangeeta, an analyst with a multinational company in Pune, had feared she was abandoned along with her newborn, a baby girl.
 
 Sangeeta was at her maternal home in Amravati when Varun, his mother Anita (60), brother Ashwini (34), uncle Surendra (50), aunt Malati (52) and cousin Priyanka (16) went missing from their Global City home in Virar (W).
 
 Police on March 15 traced Varun’s whereabouts to Pune when he was found chatting using his Facebook account. By March 21, the entire family was traced to Harihar Nagar in Ujjain, where they had rented a flat and were selling religious material and books outside temples.
 
 Surendra, an insurance agent, had reportedly taken loans of Rs 6 lakh from moneylenders but was unable to repay them. The family decided to flee on the pretext of going to perform rituals of Varun’s father, Satishchandra, who had passed away last August.
 
 Sangeeta had claimed that she wanted to return to her in-laws’ home and was trying to contact them. Varun, a graphic designer, whom she had married in April 2016, had spoken to her a day before he went missing. Sangeeta had claimed that her in-laws were unhappy with her delivering a girl in June and had not bothered to see the baby. Varun had met her and the baby a week before he disappeared.
 
 Police traced the family’s mobile location to Surat following Sangeeta’s complaint. The family is being brought to Virar but police said no case has been filed as no creditor has complained.
 
 Sangeeta, who was informed about her in-laws, was not reachable.
