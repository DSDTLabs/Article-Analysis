BENGALURU: The ongoing turf war between senior BJP leaders BS Yeddyurappa and   took a new turn on Tuesday, with Eshwarappa saying his newly floated organization,  , won't work towards making Yeddyurappa the next chief minister of the state.

 Eshwarappa, who was in Kalaburagi, told reporters that his `apolitical' organization will only work for the depressed classes. “Initially , we had a goal of making Yeddyurappa the CM. But we have changed our stance after Yeddyurappa himself said he doesn't need the support of any brigade,“ he added.
 
 Eshwarappa said he had informed both the BJP and RSS top leaders about his decision and hoped for RSS support in furthering the brigade's goals. “Now on, we have decided to go by advice from heads of religious mutts who have been guiding us. We aren't against any person or party , but we won't support any political party ,“ Eshwarappa said.
 
 The rift between the two BJP heavyweights has been widening ever since they parted ways over the selection of office-bearers of state and district-level units.
 
 Meanwhile, former mayor D Venkatesh Murthy , who was general secretary of the Sangolli Rayanna Brigade, was sacked purportedly for siding with the Yeddyurappa camp.
