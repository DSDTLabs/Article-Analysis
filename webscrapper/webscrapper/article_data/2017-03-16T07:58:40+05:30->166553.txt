PUNE: The city crime branch arrested the vice-president of an organisation for minorities and detained his 15-year-old   on Monday for their alleged involvement in as many as 15 house break-ins across the city. 

 Police recovered laptops, wrist watches, digital cameras, cellphones, tablets, gold ornaments and other valuables from the duo.
 
 A police team headed by assistant commissioner of police (crime) Arun Walture, senior inspector Rajendra Todkar and others arrested Prakash alias Nanabhau Shankar Lanke (40) of Vishrantwadi and detained his son.
 
 “With the arrest and subsequent searches of his house, we have solved 14 cases of house break-ins and recovered valuables of Rs 15 lakh from his house and from one of the jewellers in the city,” deputy commissioner of police (cyber & economics)   said.
 
 Sakore added that Lanke claimed he was the vice-president of   Minorities Suraksha Mahasangh, Maharashtra. “He took his son’s help to execute thefts in Vishrantwadi and Khadki. Lanke’s wife was also helping them,” he said.
 
  “Lanke has strong legal knowledge. He answers police queries with ease and attempts to put pressure on the police officers. He even submitted fake and misleading applications to the government to avert his arrest,” Sakore said.
 
 After stealing the gold ornaments Lanke would hand them over to his wife. She would sell or mortgage these ornaments at a Khadki-based jewellery store. With this money, Lanke’s wife procured new gold ornaments and mortgaged these ornaments with a gold loan company.
 
 Lanke was produced before a city court, which remanded him in 10 days of police custody.
