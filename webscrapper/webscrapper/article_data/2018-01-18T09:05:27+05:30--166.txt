MUMBAI: Privately owned land in rural areas acquired for public infrastructure projects will now get an increased compensation four times the  . The state cabinet on Wednesday cleared the proposal to amend the  , which will subsume four different Acts once it is cleared by the  .

 The four Acts—Maharashtra National Highway Act 1955,   Industrial Development Act 1961, Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority Act 1976, and Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act 1966—empowered government agencies to acquire land in different ways. When enforced, the amended Land Acquistion Act will bring parity in the acquisition rates.
 
 Currently, project-affected persons get 2-3 times the RR rate when their rural land is acquired by the state.
 
 
 
 
 Due to the cabinet decision, the price of land acquisition under these four state legislations will also be given to the rural landlord at four times the market price.
 
 Officials said this will ensure that land is accquired easily and the project takes off smoothly. “Often, land acquisiton is the issue. It delays the project, leading to cost escalation,” said a senior revenue department official.
 
 The state government has also decided to take control of private land by direct purchase through negotiation, which means the department can decide to give more than four times the compensation amount depending on the project and its importance. For instance, the compensation announced by the state government for land procurement for the Mumbai-Nagpur Supercommunication Highway is nearly six times the RR rate.
