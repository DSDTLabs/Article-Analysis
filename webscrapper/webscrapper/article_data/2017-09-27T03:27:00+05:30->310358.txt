Panaji: Almost ten months after the ministry of home affairs order empowered district collectors in Goa to inquire into cases of dual citizenship, the state government has given the two district collectors the go ahead to invite applications and objections from those who have acquired Portuguese nationality or registered their births in the country. A public notice is expected to be issued this week giving people 90 days to send in applications relating to their own citizenship status or send in objections about another’s citizenship. Cases primarily relating to those holding more than one passport are expected to be heard, a source said. “The inquiry shall be conducted in a fair and transparent manner, keeping in mind provisions contained in the Act and the Citizenship Rules 2009,” the notification states. Once applications are received, the collectors will conduct hearings and verify documentary proof and take decisions on a case-to-case basis.  They will then make appropriate recommendations to the central government through the state government in this regard. The order of the ministry of home affairs was published on November 22, 2016, and will be in force for a period of two years.  There are thousands of residents who have registered their births in Portugal just to pave the way for their children to obtain a Portuguese passport. However, they have neither obtained a Bilhete de Identidade (ID card) nor a Portuguese passport.
