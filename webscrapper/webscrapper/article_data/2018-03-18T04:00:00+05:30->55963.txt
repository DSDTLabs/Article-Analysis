Vadodara: Two flats in Rajkamal Society near sub-registrar’s office in Akota were burgled in the wee hours of Friday. Burglars decamped with ornaments worth over Rs 6 lakh.

 The complainant Dilip Dave (74) told the police in his complaint that when he was in Ahmedabad to celebrate his grandson’s birthday, he got a call from his neighbour on Friday morning to inform that his and another neighbour Meena Shah’s houses were broken into. Dave, who had gone to Ahmedabad on Thursday, asked his relatives to go and check, who later told him that the cupboards and safes in the house were broken and all belongings are lying scattered in the house.
 
 Later, when other neighbours checked Shah’s house, similar situation was found there too. Police said that Shah had gone to Goa for a religious event. Dave immediately left for the city with his son, who is a lawyer. After checking his house, Dave learnt that the thieves had stolen gold, silver and diamond ornaments worth over Rs 6 lakh. Police could not know what was stolen from Shah’s house since she had not returned to the city. Dave registered the complaint at Gotri police station on Friday midnight.
