NEW DELHI: Ukraine’s move to seek legal assistance from India against some of its officials in a corruption case connected to a deal to supply spares for   military transport aircraft of  , which was inked between the two countries in November 2014, has triggered a political slugfest here.

 
 While   president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday demanded immediate action from PM  , the NDA government said the allegations of kickbacks worth $2.6 million (Rs 17.55 crore) were against officials of the Ukrainian state-run Spetstechnoexport company.
 
 “There are no allegations against any Indian government official. The Indian government has only been requested to render legal assistance, through a request dated March 6 to the external affairs and home ministries, in the investigation of a criminal case filed against officials of the   government’s state-owned enterprise,” said the defence ministry, in a statement on Thursday. 
 
 The controversy has arisen after Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NAB) wrote to the Indian government for assistance in the criminal case of misappropriation of public funds connected to the deal to supply AN-32 spares inked on November 26, 2014. NAB said Spetstechnoexport inked another contract, nearly 11 months later, with a little-known entity named Global Marketing SP Ltd it “to provide services related to the implementation” of the November 2014 contract.
 
 This led to the transfer of $2.6 million to the account of Global Marketing SP Ltd in UAE at a time when the November 2014 deal was still to be fully executed. The Indian MOD, however, said neither its officials nor IAF ones had “interacted or signed any agreement” with Global Marketing SP Ltd.
