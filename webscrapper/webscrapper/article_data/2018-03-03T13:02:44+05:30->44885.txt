VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh   and Museum department has been conducting excavations at the   Project area for the past few months. The excavation is important as the area will soon be submerged after construction of the dam.

 Four months into the excavations at a megalithic burial site, officials explained that the experience and findings were both rewarding and successful. 
 
 Officials said the burials are all dolmans and locally known as ‘Rakshasagulu’. 
 
 Trenches were carefully dug one metre deep and after which, experts found that most of the pits were rectangular and oval shaped. Officials recovered pots, human skeletal remains in the form charred bones, iron implements, beads etc. According to officials, the excavations conducted so far have brought to light the legged pots or urns having human remains which are covered by lids. 
 
 They also recovered terracotta figurines and varieties of beads like crystal, carnelian, jasper, and glass. Officials pointed out that the megalithic culture in India is in controversy as many scholars have given their opinion based on the burials studied by them. Famous British archaeologist late   once suggested that the culture had survived in between 200 BC and 50 AD. However, the radio carbon dates collected so far reveal that some of the artefacts go back to 555 BC.
 
 A few megalithic sites in Andhra Pradesh have carbon dates and suggest a chronological frame work of Polakonda (185 BC - 35 AD), Satanikota (235 – 575 AD). The researches done so far in South India revealed that the civilization started in 1100 BC and continued up to 3rd century AD. The excavations were headed by the  , commissioner of archaeology and museum department. The department is also all set to conduct an international conference on ‘Salvage Archaeology And Recent Researches On The Megalithic Culture Of South Asia’ at   from March 12 to 14.
