NEW DELHI: An audit of availability of medicines in state-run hospitals, compiled on the orders chief minister  , has found major gap in the services. It shows that at least five big hospitals, including Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital in east Delhi and   (DDU) Hospital in West Delhi, don’t have 50% of the medicines in stock.

 Other hospitals too, the audit reveals, have shortage of medicines in spite of standing instruction issued by government to ensure 100% availability of medicines in February.
 
 The CM has taken strong exception to the non-availability of medicines and consumables in some Delhi government hospitals and directed the chief secretary to ensure 100% availability of these articles at the earliest, said a statement issued by the government on Tuesday evening.
 
 It added that Kejriwal has also received complaints about x-ray and CT scan machines not functioning properly in some hospitals. Minutes later, he tweeted about it. He warned: “Will make surprise checks in some hospitals to ensure adequate medicines, consumables n functioning equipment.”
 
 The CM, officials said, had directed the chief secretary on April 6 to submit written report on 1st and 15th of every month on availability of medicines and consumables but this direction was not complied with.
 
 The CM said chief secretary M M Kutty will now certify every month that all equipment is functioning properly.
 
 “Directed chief secy today to ensure 100per cent availability of medicines in all Del govt hospitals. CS to certify every month (sic),” the CM tweeted.
 
 All public hospitals have a list of up to 1200 medicines and consumables mentioned in the Essential Drug List. They can be procured through the   (CPA) or directly from the pharmacy in case of emergency.
