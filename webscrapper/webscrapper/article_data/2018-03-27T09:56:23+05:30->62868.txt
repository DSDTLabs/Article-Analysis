Chennai: Merely a week after becoming   ( ) champions for the second time,   are being forced to prepare for their next assignment —   — away from their home due to financial issues. It was learnt that the players, including the four registered foreigners, were being told to assemble in Kolkata by Tuesday and they will start their three-day practice session at the Salt Lake Stadium from Wednesday.

 
 
 The Super Cup will be held in knockout format and Chennaiyin will take on   at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar on Saturday.
 
 Back home, Chennaiyin used to train at the Nehru Park. For each training session, they had to shell out around Rs 60,000 apart from maintaining the pitch. In Kolkata, though, the franchise has to pay only Rs 5000 approximately for each session to the West Bengal government, who are in charge of the Salt Lake Stadium. 
 
 A source also said that since Kolkata is close to Bhubaneswar, the team went for the best available option logistically. “All other teams are training at their home except Chennaiyin. Everything needs to be shifted just for a couple of days. Since Kolkata was closer to the Super Cup venue and Chennaiyin had to pay a much lesser amount to Salt Lake Stadium authorities than what they would have to pay to SDAT, they shifted base,” the source told TOI on Monday.
 
 Chennaiyin to miss Germanpreet:
 
 The Chennaiyin team will miss teenage midfielder Germanpreet Singh in the Super Cup. The 19-year-old, who was in India’s 32-member probables squad for Kyrgyz Republic match on Tuesday, sustained a collar-bone injury at the national camp in Mumbai last week. “Germanpreet sustained the injury during a practice session when he went for an aerial tussle. So he is ruled out of the competition,” said the source.
