TRICHY: At a time when the demand for   is on the decline, the Tamil Nadu handloom textiles department has launched a 15-day exhibition to provide impetus to the ailing industry. 

 State minister for tourism   inaugurated the exhibition at   at Woraiyur on Saturday.
 
 The handloom industry took a beating as   were unable to cope with the emerging trends in the garments industry. “The preference for handloom textiles is declining as people find items made in the power loom more attractive. The introduction of GST has also increased the price of handloom textiles,” said PV Ramasamy, a weaver from Karur. 
 
 Thathaingarpettai on the outskirts of Trichy was once famous for its hand-woven dhotis. However, the introduction of power loom ruined the sector as weavers found it difficult to compete with the sheer volume produced by the machines. 
 
 “Former chief minister MGR was fond of dhotis from Thathaingarpettai. Now, there are around 75 weavers in our area who have continued with the business. Over 400 weavers have abandoned the business. The invasion of power loom caused a setback for us because they can produce items in large numbers, said Ravi from T Pettai. 
 
 A total of 25 stalls of various handloom textile weavers from Karur, Kancheepuram, Karur, Nagercoil, Salem and a few other areas have been set up at the exhibition. There is also a discount of 20 % on all the products. The textiles department has set a sales target of Rs 25 lakhs for the exhibition. 
 
 However, not all is lost for the industry as it still has its customer base who feel comfortable in wearing handloom garments. “Our business is moving on because of a set of customers whose preference is handloom garments. They prefer it because of the quality. If we are able to bring it to the larger market, the industry can be revived,” said S Saravanan, of
