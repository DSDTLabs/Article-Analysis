PATNA: The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) disbursed Rs5,525 crore for various activities in the state during 20117-18. The amount is Rs960 crore more than the sum disbursed in the 2016-17 fiscal,   chief general manager ( ) S K Majumdar said on Monday.

 The money was given to commercial banks and regional rural banks (RRBs) to reimburse the amount disbursed by them by way of both short-term and long-term loans, besides giving money to the state government under rural infrastructure development fund (RIDF) for the creation of rural infrastructure, Majumdar added.
 
 While Rs2,098 crore was given to commercial banks and RRBs for loaning activities to promote capital formation, Rs989 crore was released to the RRBs and cooperative banks against short-term loans given by them at concessional rate of interest to the customers from rural areas, he said.
 
 Under RIDF alone, Rs1,648 was given to the state government during 2017-18 and Rs1,604.25 crore was sanctioned for the new infrastructure projects to be taken up during this fiscal. 
 
 Majumdar said Rs120 crore was spent by the government on the construction of warehouses during 2017-18 and new projects worth Rs190 crore have also been proposed.
 
 Under its newly constituted NABARD Infrastructure Development Assistance (NIDA) fund, Rs2,820.41 worth of loan has already been sanctioned for the state government. Under it, Rs500 crore was spent on rural roads under   (GSTNY) during 2017-18, while Rs2,000 would be spent during the current fiscal.
 
 Majumdar said NABARD is engaged in creating local networks for water conservation and has also been supporting digitization of the self-help groups (SHGs) in six districts.
