RAJASANSI: Union finance minister Arun Jaitely on Sunday targeted Punjab Congress chief Captain   for allegedly amassing huge wealth in  . Addressing a rally in favour of SAD BJP alliances’ Lok Sabha byelection candidate   and Rajasansi assembly candidate Vir Singh Lopoke, Jaitley said, “The money was illegally grabbed by Captain and his family members during the Congress’s tenure from 2002-2007 in Punjab when Amarinder headed a corrupt government.”

 The BJP leader said that the details regarding the Swiss bank accounts of Captain and his family had surfaced during the UPA government at the Centre but it was their government which made the illegal hoarding of the money public.
 
 “Modi government is committed to providing clean governance but the previous UPA government was fountain head of the corruption,” said Jaitley demanding votes in the name of Modi and the SAD-BJP alliance in the state. At the same time, he predicted that the SAD-BJP coalition was is set to form government in state for a record third time.
 
 Calling the tie-up historical and a specimen of social engineering, he said, “The alliance is committed to communal harmony and social peace. The development is the only priority of the 40-year-old SAD-BJP coalition.”
 
 Chhina said that earlier MPs of Amritsar, including Navjot Singh Sidhu and Captain Amarinder, had remained absent from constituency and did not even attend Parliament which led to the total neglect of the area.
 
 “I am amongst you and there is NDA government in Centre and I can fetch maximum grants,” he said, adding that Jaitley was committed son of soil who was always concerned about the progress and welfare of Punjab.
 
 In reply to a media query about Amarinder’s charge that corruption was at the peak in Punjab during the current government, Jaitley said, “Badal provided the cleanest administration ever during the last 10 years.”
