KOLKATA: Actor   Chatterjee will have to spend some more days in jail as the Alipore court on Thursday morning adjourned his bail plea hearing for July 26. Vikram - at present in Presidency jail after his arrest in the   death case - was hoping for relief while he has to be produced in court on July 24 after his judicial custody period comes to an end. 

 The day started with defence lawyer Anirban Guha Thakurta - presenting his case before district sessions judge   - around 11am. Anirban pointed to the circumstances of the case and proceeded to ascertain why they thought the custody remand and slapping of IPC 304 against Vikram had legal flaws. Almost seven minutes into the argument, the judge asked him how long he might take to present his case. He said this might require some more time. 
 
 This allowed a section of lawyers present in the court, led by senior lawyer Tirthankar Roy, to intervene and plead with the court that the defence was wasting time.
 
 The two sides then exchanged several rounds of argument and counter-argument. While Guha Thakurta pleaded that the judge allowed him time after "completion of all his pending work," the judge maintained he needed to find enough time to hear the petition. 
 
 Accordingly, he fixed July 26 for the date of hearing.
 
 The police though have not ruled out the possibility of a supplementary chargesheet against Vikram. Though the public prosecutor   did not get a chance to present the prosecution's points in court on Thursday, police sources claimed the bail application will be contested.
