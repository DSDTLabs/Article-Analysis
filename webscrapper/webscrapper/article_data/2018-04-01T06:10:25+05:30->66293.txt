 Rohini Sindhuri has taken on district in-charge minister A Manju by ordering issuance of notice for use of a public place for political activity.

 She said Manju used his office in the Inspection Bungalow, which is banned as per the model code of conduct. Following her direction, authorities locked his office on Saturday and a notice was issued. It all started on Saturday morning with a few persons alleging that the minister's office was still functioning from the Inspection Bungalow. In the afternoon, a flying squad visited the IB and confirmed that it was true. According to sources, at the time of the visit of the flying squad members, some women employees were working in the ministerâ€™s office.
 
 Based on the finding, the district administration issued a notice seeking an explanation from both the minister and the PWD executive engineer.
 
 
 
 
 Both the minister and engineer have been given time till 10am Monday to give a written explanation for not vacating the office. After receiving their explanation, action will be initiated according to the code of conduct of the Election Commission, said the DC, who is the district election officer.
 
 The building belongs to the PWD. An explanation has been sought from department officers how political persons were allowed to work even after the enforcement of the model code of conduct.
 
 The IAS officer, who has challenged her transfer at the CAT and high court, said political pressure was the reason for her premature transfer.
