WASHINGTON:   Donald Trump on Monday lashed out at   and accused it of "lies and deceit" in return for the $33 billion aid the US gave it in the last 15 years. 
 
  
  "The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies and deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools," Trump said in a strongly worded tweet.
 
  
  
  "They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in  , with little help. No more!" Trump said in a tweet.
  
  This is the strongest warning yet from the US president.
  
 Following Trump's sharp criticism, Pakistan foreign minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif tweeted that his country will soon respond to Trump's tweet and will let the world know the truth.
 
  
  
  In his new South Asia Policy unveiled in August, Trump had called for tougher measures against Pakistan if it did not cooperate with the US in its fight against terrorism. 
  
  Last week, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration was seriously weighing whether to withhold $255 million in aid that it had already delayed sending to Islamabad over its failure to crackdown on terror groups in Pakistan.
  
  
 
 
 Last week, Vice President Mike Pence told the American troops during a visit to Afghanistan that President Trump has put Pakistan on notice.
 
 Earlier this month, President Trump had said while unveiling his National Security Strategy that the US makes massive payments every year to Pakistan and they have to help.
