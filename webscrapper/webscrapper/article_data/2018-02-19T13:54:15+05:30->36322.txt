CHANDIGARH: “I can smell a corruption and vested interest of a   member in not filling public interest litigation (PIL) against the increase in the garbage collection charges in the city, which was decided in the last meeting,” alleged a Foswac member   Singh in the Foswac meeting held on Sunday.

 The member said for past one month he had been tring to take up the issue of filling PIL for the benefit of the residents, who are facing harassment everyday because of the dictatorship of the garbage collection staff in majority of the sectors. But, till date, nothing has been done by the association.
 
 Referring to the last meeting, Amardeep said the garbage collection staff has been circulating a notification signed by the MC higher official to implement new rates for it. At present, the residents are paying Rs 50 to Rs 60 for   houses and Rs 55 to Rs 100 for 1 Kanal houses. But the staff is asking Rs 100 for less than 1 kanal and Rs 250 for 1 kanal houses as new rates. After a lengthy discussion, it was proposed to file a PIL against the dictatorship of the garbage collection staff.
 
 Another RWA president  , a resident of Sector 8, also raised an issue of the overcharging by the garbage collection staff in the meeting. He said the issue was discussed in the December meeting, but till date nothing is done by the Foswac. The garbage collection staff is charging Rs 250 per floor from the Sector 8 residents, which is exhorbitantly high, he added.
 
 Members asked the Foswac body to take it on priority and file a PIL at the earliest for the residents’ welfare. Heated arguments were exchanged among the members on the issue during the meeting.
 
 Foswac chairman   said he will take up the issue with the authorities soon.
