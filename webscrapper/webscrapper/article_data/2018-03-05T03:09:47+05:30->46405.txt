MUMBAI: A 35-year-old   suffered critical injuries after probably jumping off from a fifth floor   of Bhabha   in Bandra (W) on Sunday. Bandra resident  , with diabetic acidosis, triggered by excessive consumption of alcohol, was undergoing treatment for six days for various ailments. He is now critical in the intensive care unit.

 Mohammed had gone to the toilet with his brother around 4.30pm. “Mohammed’s family, waiting outside the toilet, got suspicious when he did not come out for few minutes. They called the attendant, who checked the toilet, and found that Mohammed had jumped from the toilet window,” said Bandra police senior inspector Pandit Thakare.
 
 Police said security guards on the ground floor rushed to the spot after they heard a loud thud. The ward boy rushed downstairs and got him admitted to the ICU. “We are collecting information on whether the patient has made a similar attempt after he got admitted,” police said. 
 
 Medical superintendent Dr P Jadhav said the patient had been grappling with withdrawal symptoms. “He injured himself badly. He sustained a head injury, fracture of the femur and upper right arm. He is on the ventilator and is critical,” said Dr Jadhav.
 
 Bandra police have made a diary entry of the incident and are probing if he tried to end his life or it was accidental.
 
 Mohammed resides with his family and is employed in a garment shop in Bandra (W).
