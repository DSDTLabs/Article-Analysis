Ludhiana: Worried over the slow pace of recovery of property tax, MC officials have decided to request the Punjab local bodies department additional chief secretary to reduce the annual target for collecting the levy. While the state government had set a Rs 100-crore target for the MC to collect   this year, the civic body could collect only Rs 59 crore to date.

 MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh said it was due to the tax waiver scheme announced by the government that they could recover only half of the pending amount. “Also, not many people cleared their dues. So, we will request the local bodies department to cut some of our targets,” he said. 
 
 A source in the civic body said it was unlikely that officials would be able to recover the entire Rs 100 crore by the end of this financial year, as only the month of March was left for collections. The officials claimed that since the government announced the tax waiver scheme, they could not impose penalty on defaulters and had to give another 10% rebate on the tax. 
 
 During the period in which the 10% rebate was offered, the MC could generate only Rs 14 crore from property tax dues. This year, tax rate was not increased in any of the sections from where property tax could be recovered. Last year too, MC could not meet its target. However, at that time, it did better than this year, collecting Rs 66 crore. The state government had set a Rs 70-crore target at that time.
 
 This time around, officials want to target to be kept between Rs 65 crore and Rs 70 crore. A source in the MC added that another reason that kept recovery of property tax slow this year was that employees were regularly kept in busy in other duties. “Even this month, our employees are busy because of the civic body polls,” the source said.
