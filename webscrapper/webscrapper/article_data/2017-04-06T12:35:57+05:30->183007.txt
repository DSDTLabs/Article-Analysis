NAGPUR: A city based writer director, Subodh Nagdeve’s   ‘Bole India Jai Bhim’ has run into rough weather as censor board of film certification is dilly dallying over its clearance. 

 The film was originally made in Marathi and was released in October 2016. “We have dubbed it in Hindi and are planning to release it in Nagpur and other regions of Vidarbha on April 7 and in Hindi speaking states on April 14 to coincide with 126th anniversary of Babasaheb,” Nagdeve told TOI.
 
 The film is based on the life of Babu Hardas LN, a disciple of Ambedkar. Hardas is credited for coining the phrase ‘Jai Bhim’. 
 
 “It is the story of how Hardas propagated this form of address. But I was told by a censor board official   that releasing the film in Hindi would vitiate the social environment,” says Nagdeve. The Marathi version of the film had been released in fifty theatres of which 30 were in Vidarbha. 
 
 “The film did not create any law and order situation then. Now too I have only dubbed it in Hindi,” says the director. There were references to some castes in the Marathi version and the film was released with it. “This time I have been asked to make 15 changes in the film which if done would destroy the story,” he says and adds, “As it is a historical film and I had put a disclaimer in the beginning but the censor board has asked me to put a ticker in the entire length of the film.”
 
 However regional officer of censor board Raju Vaidya denied these claims. “He has not submitted the film in the correct format. We are meeting again on Thursday to sort this,” he said. Made on a budget of Rs 50 lakh, the film has been shot in Nagpur and features many local artistes.
