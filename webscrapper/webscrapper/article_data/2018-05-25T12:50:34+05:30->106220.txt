34-year-old Anubha Verma started her high -intensity interval training sessions to lose weight. Much to her surprise, everyone in the class was miraculously shedding inches except her. On her trainer's insistence, she got herself tested for   and found out that she was suffering from  . Experts tell us that this is nothing new. One-third of thyroid patients are unaware of their condition, simply because the symptoms for thyroid-related illness vary depending upon severity. 

  In India, Thyroid disorders are on a rise with more than forty-two million people suffering from different   disorders, and many more remain undiagnosed.
 
  Did you know women are more prone to Thyroid dysfunction than men and Subclinical Hypothyroidism has emerged as the biggest thyroid disorder across India? Also, 1 in 10 adults in India suffer from hypothyroidism. The main cause of thyroid issues is iodine imbalance, and can be easily avoided through dietary control and regular exercise.
 
  
 
 
  Speaking about the long-term trend with respect to thyroid problems in women in India, Dr Usha Menon, Clinical Associate Professor, Centre for Endocrinology and Diabetes, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Kochi says, “Thyroid problems are increasing in India, especially in women. This may be due to the fact that now thyroid blood tests are easily available in every nook and corner of the country at reasonable cost. Moreover, the awareness about thyroid problems has increased considerably among doctors and public in the last decade. As thyroid disorders usually produce only subtle symptoms more people are screened for thyroid disorders when they have nonspecific symptoms such as tiredness weight gain etc. hence it is not clear whether this is an actual increase or better detection”.
 
  Dr Avinash Phadke, President Technology & Mentor (Clinical Pathology) SRL Diagnostics shares, “Although research is still underway it's been known that genetics plays a crucial role in both, determination of thyroid hormones and TSH concentrations, and susceptibility to autoimmune thyroid disease. People who have a history of thyroid problems in their family would be predisposed to thyroid abnormalities. Further, iodine deficiency has been the most common cause of thyroid disorders and subsequent brain damage. Currently, with more than two decades of sustained activity 86 per cent of the world population has access to iodized salt. Only regular check-ups and monitoring of this critical gland, especially after during pregnancy and after the age of 30, can let a person know whether her or his thyroid is in order.”
 
  On the gender disparity, Dr Phadke explained, “A woman’s body is more prone to different hormonal leaps, more sensitive to hormonal changes and is overall, more reactive than the male body. Iodine deficiency leads to further complications in the female thyroid system. Stress is also known to cause a spike in TSH hormone release. Women undergoing an annual screening of thyroid gland can enable us to detect problems earlier, and it will be thus easier to start the treatment.” added Dr Phadke. 
 
  
 
 
  Hypothyroidism is a disorder of the endocrine system, in which the thyroid gland is incapable of producing enough thyroid hormone for the body to function properly.

  Drink plenty of water as it helps in controlling body temperature. Water keeps your skin hydrated and eliminates fatigue. It should be noted that for Hypothyroid patients, it is important to drink 8-10 glasses of water as it speeds up the metabolism and results in weight loss.

  • 
 You must exercise everyday. Exercises such as cardiovascular, strength and weight training are extremely beneficial. Also, doing yoga helps in preventing different diseases.
