 Locals said Praveen, Deepak and four other boys were spotted near the main gate of the park around 8am. “The boys entered the park by jumping over the fence although we warned them against doing so,” said a local, adding the main gate of the park was locked when the boys reached there.
 
 Police said Madan Mohan, a lawyer who lives near the park on Road Number 3 of Pataliputra Colony, was looking after maintenance and security of the park. “The park has been running without a guard. The pond in which the boys drowned had not been in use for several years,” the police added.
 
 SHO of Pataliputra police station Tarkeshwar Nath Tiwary said while Praveen and Deepak were students of Red Rose Public School and Kamla Nehru School, respectively. “The incident came to light after one of the boys informed the parents of the deceased about it. We have started an inquiry into the incident,” the SHO said, adding Deepak’s father Harihar Rai and Praveen’s father Kashi Rai are milk traders.
 
 Mohan, on his part, said, “One of the keys of the entrance gate was with me and another with the society. The boys’ slippers were found near the entrance gate and their clothes were recovered from poolside. They probably entered the park by jumping over the fence. I was at Patna high court when the incident occurred.”
 
 Police said the bodies of the boys were handed over to their family members after post-mortem and an FIR was lodged with Pataliputra police station.
