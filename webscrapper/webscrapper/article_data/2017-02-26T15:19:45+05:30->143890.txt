 as a part of his schedule to speak at Harvard University stopped over at Nashua for a talk. And boy, what a event that was! The star spoke about politics his unintended entry into films, his philosophies and his aspirations foraying into politics. 

 However he also obliged the fans every now and then addressing their screams in his own style. He also switched to Telugu later into the speech. 
 
 The highlight of the 50-minute long speech was when he called for his iconic red towel from the back stage. He said, 'Idi oka samanyudi symbol' referring to the towel and explaining why he flaunts it in his public appearances. And of course he ended the speech with his trademark 'Jai Hind!'
