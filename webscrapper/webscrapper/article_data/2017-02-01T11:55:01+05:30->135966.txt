INDORE: Amidst the protest against the state government’s plan to relocate the district court on the agriculture college’s land, a former office-bearer of Congress party approached the district collector with a list of ‘ideal’ spots for developing the court’s modern building.

 During the weekly public hearing, the former state president of ‘MP   Jhuggi Jhopadi Prakosth’, Rajkumar Tonare approached the collector P Narahari with a list of ‘ideal’ lands for the court’s new building. Tonare requested the collector to consider Humukchand Mill’s land as the first choice.
 
 “The state government can use this land for developing the court’s building and in return, can pay to the mill workers, who have been fighting to get their dues from over 25 years. Unlike the   and Pipliyahana Lake, the state government is unlikely to get any objection for it” said Tonere.
 
 He also drew the collector’s attention for considering a land situated next to   in Pardeshipura. The land is however disputed and a case related to obtaining the land by fraudulent means is in the court.
 
 The list submitted by Tonere included the options to use Hotel Sayaji’s building as the   (IDA) is contemplating to cancel its lease for violating the lease terms.
 
 “The government had first planned to relocate the court near Pipliyahana Lake and when opposed by locals, it made a plan to give 20 acre land of the agriculture college for the court’s building, which is also receiving lots of criticism. The government should immediately take decision in lease cancellation of Hotel Sayaji’s land and if possible, allot it for developing the court’s building” Tonere said.
 
 Besides, he mentioned that instead of shifting the court, the authority can also consider to extend the existing court campus by using space available in the divisional commissioner office situated next to it.
