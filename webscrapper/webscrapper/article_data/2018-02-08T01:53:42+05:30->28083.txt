 In his complaint, the youth said that the incident happened in the wee hours of Tuesday, when he was on his way to a friendâ€™s place. He had withdrawn Rs 60,000 from an ATM near Amar Colony and was driving back home when he was waylaid near Kailash Colony.
 
 He said that the men brushed his car, smashing the side mirror and stopped the Ertiga in front of his vehicle forcing him stop. When he stepped out, the accused came out and started to thrash him. When he resisted, one of the men asked his associate to hand over a gun and threatened to shoot him. They then took the cash, forced him to get inside the car and locked it until they left.

 A case of theft after confinement was registered. While the CCTV footage from the area is being scanned to identify the vehicle, police have also questioned the youth in this regard. They suspect someone known to him to have trailed him to the ATM.
