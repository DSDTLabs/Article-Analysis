ROHTAK: The former sarpanch of Bibipur village in Jind district, Sunil Jaglan, who shot to fame with his ‘Selfie with Daughter’ campaign, is now appealing to men to break stereotypes and share pictures of their daughters, sisters and mothers on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram to pay tribute to them on International Women’s Day.

 “Under ‘My Profile Picture with Women’ campaign, we have been urging people to celebrate the first week of March as Women’s Day Week by sharing their pictures on social-media platforms to give the fair sex a good and positive feeling in this male-dominated society,” said Jaglan.
 
 Jaglan’s initiative to promote ‘Save the Girl Child’ campaign by launching Selfie with Daughter in June 2015 was praised by Prime Minister   during his interaction with CEOs at the   in September two years ago.
 
 Revealing details of his concept, Jaglan said he had been holding meetings and dispatching messages through social media to make International Women’s Day (March 8) historic in the real sense where male members of family, who usually debar girls not to share their photos on public platforms, share it with them.
 
 He said ‘My Profile Picture with Women’ was generating a lot of buzz on social media and had been appreciated by people from all walks of lifes. Lauding the move, a woman from Jind district, Mamta Rani, said the awareness campaign would give them a confidence to feel good about themselves. “If my brother or father share a picture with me or my mother on social media, it would make us feel good about ourselves,” she said.
