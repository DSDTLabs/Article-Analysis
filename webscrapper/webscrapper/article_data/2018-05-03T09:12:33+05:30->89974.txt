HYDERABAD: A division bench of the Hyderabad High Court, comprising acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice K  , on Wednesday reserved its orders on maintainability of the writ appeal filed by 12   of the   (TRS). The MLAs challenged the judgment of a single-judge bench, which had restored the Assembly membership of expelled   MLAs K Venkat Reddy and SA  .

 
 On Wednesday, C S Vaidyanathan , senior counsel appearing for the TRS MLAs, concluded his argument and said that written arguments in the matter would be submitted. He averred that it was not correct to contend that the appeal cannot be filed by MLAs and only the speaker or secretary could file an appeal. Any member of the   could come forward to protect the majesty of the House and he recalled the fact that throwing ear phones at the governor was not disputed.
 
 Ravi Shankar Jandhyala, counsel for the two Congress MLAs, told the High Court that every political party cannot maintain separate appeals like this. Then, the arguments from House would shift to court room. He said the appeal was not maintainable and the division bench had directed him to file written arguments by Thursday.
