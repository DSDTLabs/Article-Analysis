NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has been planning to build a district centre-like facility on a 1.26-hectare plot near  . This one on Bungalow Road currently has old officers’ quarters. 

 The decision was taken in a recent meeting chaired by commissioner Praveen Kumar Gupta with the aim of redeveloping old corporation properties to monetise them and end the financial crunch. “The existing structures will be demolished and employees will be relocated or provided housing allowance instead. On a pilot basis, we have decided to hand over the project to NBCC, which will create a district centre-like facility that will have a multiplex and a mall,” said a senior   official. 
 
 Elsewhere, the Kedarnath Sahni Auditorium at Civic Centre would also be leased out to private players on a monthly fee basis. “It’s massively underutilised and is booked only for 50 days a year. It’s a state-of-the-art facility on a par with Kamani and Shah auditoriums, and through aggressive marketing, private players may be able to use it effectively,” said Renu Jagdev, additional commissioner (revenue). The auditorium can pack in 1,000 people. The corporation would use it sometimes.
