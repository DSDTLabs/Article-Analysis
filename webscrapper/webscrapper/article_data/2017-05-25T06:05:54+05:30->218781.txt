PANAJI: Three   have sought the state government’s permission to begin an extra division in the first year of their respective undergraduate programme to accommodate 40 or more students who are currently on their waitlist.

 A total of 16,521 students appeared for the Class XII board exams this year, and the resultant high pass percentage has led to a shortfall of seats in some colleges. As such, S S   at Miramar, Saraswat College at  , and   at   have been asked by the Goa University to seek the government’s permission to open up extra divisions, as such a move would involve additional financial liabilities, such as payment of salaries to the faculty. 
 
 One of these colleges is operated by the state government and the other two are aided by it.
 
 While around 800 more students have cleared the Class XII state board exams this year, students from national boards who seek to join colleges affiliated to the Goa University also add to the numbers. 
 
 Sources at the university said permission for an extra division with contractual faculty members is likely to be granted initially, an arrangement that will be reviewed on a yearly basis. Permission to hire a permanent faculty is usually granted after the additional division is observed to be receiving a consistent intake of students.
 
 In view of a surge in students to have clearing the Class XII exams this year, the Goa University’s academic council has also granted permission for a blanket 10% increase in intake at the first year of the BA, BCom and BSc programmes for the new academic year 2017-18, Goa University registrar Y V Reddy, said. The three colleges that seek to open an extra division, however, will not be eligible for this 10% increase. Their intake in existing divisions will also remain the same as last year.
 
 “If, at the end of the admission season, some students are still left without college seats, we will see to it that they are accommodated,” Reddy said.
