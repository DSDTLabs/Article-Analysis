HYDERABAD: Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee chief official spokesperson Dasoju Sravan demanded that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao immediately remove his son and municipal minister KT Rama Rao from his cabinet and order an inquiry by a sitting judge into corruption allegations in Sircilla municipality.

 “KCR claims he is extending a corrupt-free rule. As he sacked deputy chief minister Rajaiah from the cabinet after allegations of corruption, KCR should also sack KTR from his ministerial posts and order an inquiry. There can’t be a different verdict in case of Rajaiah and KTR. Justice should be equal to all,” Sravan said in a statement on Sunday.
