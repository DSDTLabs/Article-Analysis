AHMEDABAD: Mansukh Shah, the founder president of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth, was shifted to   Central Jail from   on Thursday.   sources said Shah was transferred to   for security reasons.

 Shah, who was arrested in a corruption case by ACB, has not been able get bail even after the chargesheet was filed in the case and he was lodged in Vadodara Jail said an ACB official.
 
 “Shah comes from Vadodara, is influential and still enjoys a lot of clout there. We fear that Shah may make a plea about a threat to him and preemptively shifted him to Sabarmati Central Jail in Ahmedabad,” an ACB official added.
 
 Jail officials said Shah has been lodged in the Chota Chakkar part of the jail, as he is an undertrial. “We have deployed adequate security around his cell,” said a senior jail official.
 
 Shah and his two associates were arrested by ACB for demanding and accepting of Rs 20 lakh from the parents of a final year MBBS student at the deemed university in February. Shah and his associates were then charged.
 
 ACB officials said the case is a landmark one for the ACB in many ways, as it has proved that a private educational institute can be brought under the ambit of the anti-corruption law and action can be initiated if officials of private colleges demand money in a quid pro quo.
