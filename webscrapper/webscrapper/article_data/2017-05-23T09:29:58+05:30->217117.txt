PUNE: Stating that the sacred groves, locally known as ‘Devrai’, were   among the communities that “protected” them all these years,   on Monday stressed that it was right time that locals were educated about their  .

 The issue cropped up during an event organised by the forest department in the city to mark the International Day of Biological Diversity.
 
 Responding to a query, chief conservator of forests (wildlife) for Pune, K P Singh, said, “Devrai, the sacred groves that grows along the Western Ghats, had been fiercely protected in the past by communities that worshipped them and regarded them as deities. However, in recent years many members of the local communities have lost connect with their gods. Because of this, these groves have lost their importance among the communities.”
 
 Biologist Sachin Punekar of BioSpheres said that apart from explaining to the local communities the biological significance of the groves, they can also be made aware that conserving these groves was in their economic interest.
 
 “Traditional beliefs had kept the groves alive and thriving so far. With a change in the mindset of the local people, the authorities can devise a model that is economically beneficial for the communities. This will help protect these   hotspots,” he told TOI.
 
 One solution Punekar suggested was sustainable eco-tourism. “If such a tourism model can employ locals and protect the rare flora and fauna of the sacred groves, then it will be a victory for all sides,” he said.
