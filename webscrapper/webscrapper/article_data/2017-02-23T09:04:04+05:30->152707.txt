MANGALURU: For this group of friends, a holiday was rudely cut short when   to them staying in the house of a friend from a different community, in Koila village of Puttur taluk in   district.

 Communal tension flared in the village when the girls, students of an engineering college in Mysuru, came over for a short vacation to the house of Sameena (name changed), a final-year engineering student. The area was tense after members of both communities came to blows, late on Tuesday.
 
 Hindu activists, on learning that Sameena’s friends were in her house in   in Koila, gathered and started raising objections, after a person spread rumours that the girls had been kidnapped and brought to Puttur.
 
 SP   said Sameena’s classmates Ramya, Reena and Sinchana (names changed) had come with her on Saturday, and were scheduled to return on Wednesday. Activists who noticed the girls from different communities at a Muslim house, accused the family of kidnapping the girls.
 
 Members of the saffron outfit started gathering at Sameena’s house around 7pm, when her father, a cleric, was away. As soon as the crowd started swelling, the family informed police, who arrived to prevent any untoward incident, and disbursed the crowd immediately.
 
 The SP, who along with other police officials rushed to the spot, asked members of both communities to maintain peace. However, when the groups started dispersing peacefully, an inebriated person started making remarks about the other community, leading to clashes. One person was injured and is being treated at a private hospital, Borase added.
 
 After the incident, the girls decided to return to their college in Mysuru.
 
 Two cases -- one by the injured person and another by Sameena’s mother – were registered at Kadaba police station.
