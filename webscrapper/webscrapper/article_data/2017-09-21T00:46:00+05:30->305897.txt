 Students also feel safe while going for coaching classes or sports training in the Metro. Priyanshi, a martial arts students who daily travels till PAC in Krishnanagar, said that her father used to drop her off earlier.

It used to cost me Rs 100. Now, I travel in just Rs 40. Besides saving money, I can also read my books on the way.”
 
 The morning worshippers also praised the Metro for a smooth ride to religious places. Inderjeet Singh, who boarded the train from Transportnagar to visit a gurdwara in Charbagh, said, “It’s a beautiful feeling to visit the gurdwara in the morning and commuting in the Metro adds to the charm.”
