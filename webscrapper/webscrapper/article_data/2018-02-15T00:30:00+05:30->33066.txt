Bengaluru: Two BBMP officials were arrested on Wednesday in connection with the death of two persons in a septic tank at a hotel in Whitefield’s AECS Layout on Tuesday.

 Senior health inspector M Devaraj and deputy health inspector Kalpana of Mahadevapura zone have been booked under IPC section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). This is the first time in the recent past where civic officials have been booked for their lapses.
 
 The BBMP officials had falsely mentioned in the trade licence that the hotel was operational in the first floor of the three-storey building when, in reality, it was in the basement. On Tuesday, police had arrested the manager of Hotel Yumlok, where the deaths had been reported.
 
 Two manual scavengers, Ravi Kumar, 29, and Ramu, 35, both residents of Kundalahalli and from Raichur district, had died of asphyxiation after they entered the septic tank. Sources said Ramu was the first one to step into the 12-foot-deep drain around 4pm. After 15 minutes, Ramu was heard shouting and thinking the former needed help, Ravi too entered the drain. The hotel staff assisting the duo grew suspicious when there was no response from them. When they peeped into the drain, they saw both lying dead.
 
  Abdul Ahad, deputy commissioner of police, Whitefield, said: “According to rules, no commercial activity should happen in the basement of multi-storey buildings. Here, the hotel was running in the basement itself. Prima facie, there’s negligence from the part of the BBMP staff.”
 
 Police commissioner T Suneel Kumar said he had explained to BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad as to why the arrest of officials in such cases is necessary.
