VISAKHAPATNAM: The agriculture department in Vizianagaram district is collaborating with experts from   to promote   in the district. 

 According to experts, the hydroponic method was developed in the early 20th century and can be broadly categorised in to two divisions — static solution method and continuous flow solution method, especially used to cultivate vegetables and seasonal crops. However, the high start up and energy costs have made it unviable in India so far.
 
 Experts led by KV Mahesh of the agriculture department in Vizianagaram district believe that the hydroponic technology could provide a healthy and cost effective way of cultivation. Mahesh said it would also be free of chemical pesticides and fungicides as soil would be eliminated. However, he did note that as of now, various studies regarding use of solar power and other renewable energy sources are still at a nascent stage and pointed out that in the next 10 years, many more farmers would take to hydroponic farming technology as it gives four times the output as compared to soil-based agriculture.
 
 Mahesh added that the method could help in promoting cultivation of export-quality vegetables. “The Krishi Vigyan Kendra experts at   are trying to rope in other experts in this field to bring this technology to farmers. As on today, our expertise is limited and much of the technology is based in the USA, making the import and management costs prohibitive.”
 
 He, however, added that with increasing droughts and decreasing water table levels, a technology that cuts out on 90 per cent of water use could prove to be the best method of cultivation. He pointed out that this method combined with drip irrigation has helped Israel thrive as an agricultural producer.
