PATNA: Prime Minister   would visit   on April 10 to preside over a Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) Gramin programme.

 PM held a videoconference in this regard with state chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh and his counterparts in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday evening. Sources said the implementation of the scheme for construction of toilets to prevent open defecation is comparatively slower in the four states. The PM enquired about the steps taken so far and the strategy adopted by the four state governments to declare all the districts in their respective states open defecation free (ODF).
 
 “PM is slated to visit Motihari on April 10 to chair an official event in which several volunteers involved in SBM will also be felicitated,” Anjani told TOI. 
 
 As far as   is concerned, only 45% of the state has been covered under the sanitation mission. “I have committed to the PM to raise the coverage of SBM above 50% by April 10 and 100% coverage by March 2019,” the chief secretary said. 
 
 Sources said 22 lakh toilets have been constructed in Bihar in the fiscal 2017-18, which is more than the total number of toilets constructed in the past three years. Total 80 lakh toilets are targeted to be constructed in Bihar under the sanitation mission.
