NAGPUR: Former deputy prime minister the late   was not just a political leader. He was also a spiritual leader whose talent cannot be limited to one field as he was a multifaceted personality,” said B Surendran, joint secretary of Indian Labour Union, Delhi, on Wednesday.

 Delivering a lecture on ‘Life and works of Babu Jagjivan Ram’, organized by RS Mundle Dharampeth Arts and Commerce College, Surendran said, “He was a bright student since his childhood. But he faced many hurdles in life as he belonged to a lower caste. But he proved his mettle.”
 
 Surendran said, “Jagjivan Ram’s views towards countrymen evolved over a period of time because his mother Vasanti Devi and teacher Kapil Tiwari inspired him to be a people’s man.” During the struggle for independence, Jagjivan Ram was mostly influenced by Mahatma Gandhi’s views. He followed Gandhi despite being criticized by many. He was an extraordinary learner as he studied history, economics, social science and many subjects on his own, thinking that it will help him serve the country better. It is a matter of concern that many of the young generation do not know what he did for the country, Surendran added.
 
 Talking about his work as a union minister, Surendran said, “Jagjivan Ram held many ministries and performed extraordinarily. He was the guiding spirit behind issuing ration cards to the poor so that they could get foodgrain at an affordable price. As defence minister, he gave a strong reply to the then Pakistan’s General Niazi when he challenged India and led us to victory in Bangladesh liberation war. He was a great patriot and wanted Hindus to stay united and work for the nation. People of the country should never forget his contribution,” Surendran added.
 
 Ulhas Aurangabadkar, president of   and Sandhya Nair, principal, were present. The programme was conducted by Govind Raj Bhata.
