SALEM: PMK leader and Dharmapuri MP   has urged governor   to order a CBI inquiry into the irregularities in   based on former registrar K Angamuthu’s ‘suicide note’. 

 He also asked the governor to look into the process of appointments of vice-chancellors to other universities in the state.
 
 On Tuesday, TOI published a report on a suicide note purported to have been written by Angamuthu. His daughter told TOI that she believes the note was written by her father, who committed suicide by consuming pesticide pills on December 18.
 
 Speaking to reporters here on Tuesday, Anbumani said except swindling of money, nothing was done in the university for the past several years. He pointed out that the note levelled allegations against former vice-chancellor   and others.
 
  “Based on Angamuthu’s letter, the governor should order a detailed and fair inquiry into the issue,” the Dharmapuri MP said.
 
 The PMK leader said his party was constantly urging the governor and the state government to order probe against Swaminathan. “Chief minister   and former higher education minister P Palaniappan used their power and saved Swaminathan,” he alleged. 
 
 Anbumani also alleged that present vice-chancellor of Periyar University P Kolandaivel was very close to Swaminathan. 
 
 “To save Swaminathan from this issue, the government had appointed Kolandaivel as the vice-chancellor,” the Dharmapuri MP further alleged.
