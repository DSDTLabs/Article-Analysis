This is the second time that we have organized the kavi sammelan but since school exams are on, only a few members could participate in todayâ€™s programme."
 
   , the senior-most member of the group, said, "Our group has people of different age groups and that's what makes it fun. I love to participate in such activities as here we can freely share our experiences and learn from each other's experiences, too."
 
  Seema, member of   group who judged the event, said, "Sabke andar pratibha chhupi hai and it should come out. Some members might think they won't be able to write and perform in public. But everyone has some thoughts and they must be expressed and I think such programmes are the best way to do that."
