NAGPUR:   of India were suffering a lot because the Forest Rights Act (FRA) was not being implemented properly. The British had taken away the rights of tribals by enacting the Forest Act. Now the oppression continues in spite of a law, said Felix Padel, anthropologist-activist and descendant of great biologist Charles  . 

 Padel was in the city to attend the 11th Adivasi Adhikar Ghoshna Diwas function. 
 
 “The forest was a community property of tribals. British took away this property by enacting laws. Independent India took the correct step by enacting FRA but its poor implementation has ensured that the injustice continues,” Padel told the media.
 
 The anthropologist charged that naxalites were hands in glove with government and mining companies. “The Maoists who opposed mines in forest areas later fell silent. Nowadays, mining companies determine their policies after having talks with the Maoists. The tribals are the sufferers in the process as they are getting displaced in large numbers,” he further said.
 
 Turning to tribal languages, Padel said that they were more ancient than Sanskrit. “These languages, which are spread over the entire country, have lot of hidden knowledge. The government should teach these languages in schools along tribal culture, economics, etc,” he added.
 
 The anthropologist further said that tribal society was the most democratic. “Their political system is connected to the soil. It has no place for capitalists and depends on consensus,” he added.
 
 Padel expressed concern over movements of tribals. “If tribal culture is to continue to exist then the movement should continue. Otherwise it will be swallowed by the mainstream,” he said.
 
 The anthropologist has done an in depth study on tribals of Orissa. He has championed their rights and has supported their struggle against mining in forest areas notably Niyamgiri.
