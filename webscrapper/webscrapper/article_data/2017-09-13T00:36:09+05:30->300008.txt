MUMBAI: NCP leader   has rubbished   leader Sanjay Raut’s article in Saamna that Prime Minister   offered her a berth in the Union cabinet at a meeting between the PM, herself and her father, NCP chief Sharad Pawar.

 “No such discussion took place between me, Pawar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Sule said in Baramati on Tuesday. However, Raut promptly contested Sule’s claim and said that the denial should come from either Modi or Pawar. Stating that he stood by what he wrote in Saamna, Raut recalled that the late Bal Thackeray never retracted from his statement.
 
 In a signed article in Saamna, the Sena mouthpiece, last Sunday, Raut claimed, quoting Pawar, that Modi said that he would like Sule to join the Cabinet. The PM made the offer at a meeting with Pawar where the Maratha strongman’s daughter was present too.
