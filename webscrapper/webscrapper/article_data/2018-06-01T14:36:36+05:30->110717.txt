VIJAYAWADA: At a time when Vijayawada Municipal Corporation ( ) is on a mission to develop green patches and parks across the city, defunct rides and inadequate greenery welcome people to G.V.S Sastry Park in Satyanarayanapuram.

 
 
 The civic body had developed Sastry park in late 1990s with a fountain, skating rink and other facilities for children to give people a green and healthy environment.
 
 The horticulture wing of VMC, which is maintaining the park, has proposed to give it a new look but the works are still incomplete.
 
 “It is a nice place for senior citizens of railway colony and nearby localities to hang out. Thanks to the negligence of VMC, the park does not have any green   and children are scared of playing with the rides, which are in a mess. The officials should develop a walking track and provide drinking water facility in the park,” said Kondapalli Rama Rao a senior citizen.
 
 M. Naga Lakshmi, a resident of Durgapuram, rued that the park does not have any board to show timings and after a few spells of rain, the grounds of the park turn out to be muddy. “The civic body should give a facelift to the park as it is the only big park in the locality, where nearly 30,000 people live,” she said.
 
 Pradeep Kumar, assistant director of horticulture in VMC said that they are planning to renovate the park soon. “We are aware of the problems in the park and we have already asked the engineering wing to prepare estimates to restore the play equipments. We will soon add gravel to prevent inundation of water in coming rainy season,” he added.
