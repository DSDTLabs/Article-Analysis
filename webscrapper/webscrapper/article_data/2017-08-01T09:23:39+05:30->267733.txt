CHENNAI: Universities, affiliated colleges and autonomous colleges will now be judged on different criteria when they apply for the   ( ) ratings. The process is also set to become more transparent, with institutes having to upload on their websites the data for the assessment, which will be carried out by a third party agency.

 This was revealed by Virander Chauhan, chairman of the executive council of NAAC and acting chairman of the   ( ), at a meeting at the   on Monday. Principals of all affiliated colleges and professors of the university along with vice-chancellor P Duraisamy were present.
 
 For instance, more weightage will be given for research in universities, while it would be less for colleges. “The research output of a university cannot be compared with that of a college,” Chauhan said.
 
 Institutes applying for NAAC grading have to upload a Self Study Report (SSR) after which an inspection is carried out by officials. A Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is arrived at based on which institutes are rated from A++ , the best rating, to D, which is the worst rating meaning that the institute is not accredited.
 
 In a major reform, a third party would be in charge of assessing the data provided which needs to be uploaded on the websites of the institutions, Chauhan said. Students will also be able to submit their feedback online.
 
 The NAAC inspection teams coming to institutions would be also be smaller and institutions would be asked to showcase their best departments, instead of every nook and corner being investigated. Moreover, they would be oblivious of the assessment process of the third party, Chauhan said.
