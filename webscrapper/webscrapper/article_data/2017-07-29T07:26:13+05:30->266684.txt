LUCKNOW: Is Tamiflu, the medicine used to treat swine flu, helping families of those who have earlier been tested influenza A H1N1 positive? With the spurt in   cases being reported in the past few days, there has also been an increase in the number of family members of such patients testing positive. This, when the health department claims its Rapid Response Team (RRT), formed to trace the patient, contact its family and educate them on precautions, gives immediate   doses to the family members as soon as a patient is reported positive.

 In the last two days, family members of three patients have also contracted the disease when the RRT had given the patients double doses of Tamiflu to be taken for five days and a single dose to family members to be taken for ten days.
 
 Doctors, however, say that Tamiflu being a treating medicine, an anti-viral, is given to close contacts so as to curtail the growth of the virus further, if it has already entered a body . “The medicine cannot prevent an infection. For that, we need to build our immunity and stay away from the patient who should be sent into isolation. The medicine acts on further growth of the virus and limits it from spreading,“ said Dr SK Rawat, additional chief medical officer (ACMO) and in-charge vector borne diseases unit. On why family members of a patient are not tested at the time when a positive case is reported in family , Dr Rawat said, “It is not possible to do so as it will create panic. A test is conducted as soon as there are any symptoms which is the right way for it.“
 
 Experts say it is possible that the manifestation of the infection in the form of symptoms might be delayed. “If somebody has been infected, it takes around 48 hours for the person to show symptoms,“ said a member of the RRT.
