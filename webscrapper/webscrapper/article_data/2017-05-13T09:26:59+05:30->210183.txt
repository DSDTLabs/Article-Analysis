AMARAVATI: Centre has decided to scrap the proposal to develop a greenfield port at Dugarajapatnam in   district.   and other experts shared that the port was not viable. Niti Aayog raised objections on the rate of return on the proposed port due to its proximity to already established ports at Krishnapatnam, Chennai and Ennore.

 Interestingly , sources said that the Centre had asked the state to propose another major project instead of Dugarajapatnam port. Even though the Centre made up its mind on scrapping Dugarajapatnam port proposal, it is not rushing the matter with the TDP government, an alliance partner of the  .
 
 "We will take a call after AP chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu returns from the United States of America," said a senior official.
 
 The Centre further conducted two separate studies to evaluate the project's viability. A US-based multinational consultancy firm conducted an in-depth study on the same.
