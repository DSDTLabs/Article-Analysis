Noida: To provide relief to hundreds of   running from pillar to post to get possession of their long-delayed homes, Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna expressway authorities are planning to take action against realtors who have not delivered their projects on time.

  Amit Mohan Prasad said on Monday he will hold a meeting with the national president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India ( ) and several other big-ticket builders with projects in Noida on Friday. 
 
 The meeting is expected to redress the issues of hundreds of homebuyers agitating against developers who have failed to deliver their units to them.
 
 According to Authority officials, the new CEO will urge developers to complete their under-construction projects at the earliest, instead of putting into place new projects and holding up their funds. Builders will also be directed to finish projects nearing completion and obtain their completion certificates.
 
 Meanwhile, Greater Noida and Yamuna expressway authorities are also getting ready to take action against truant builders in their areas. 
 
 Under their scanner are developers who have failed to deliver residences as promised to homebuyers, and those who are yet to clear dues to the two authorities to the tune of Rs 10,000 crore.
 
  Prabhat Kumar, chairman of the two authorities, had set up a probe committee to look into the issue last week, and it submitted a report in a meeting held on Monday. The twin authorities are getting now ready to initiate action against several builders in the two regions, officials said.
