RAJKOT: A  , who could not be arrested as his identity could not be ascertained, was arrested on Tuesday night in   of Abadasa taluka in Kutch district. 

 Police identified the accused as   (22), a resident of Mafatnagar in Dumara village. 
 
 Vasant had allegedly raped a 56-year-old widow at knifepoint and looted Rs 2,500 cash from her house near Jain derasar in Dumra village on March 4. 
 
 “The accused’s identity remained unknown for several days. However, we caught him on the closed circuit television camera installed in the derasar. After we established his identity, we found that Vasant used to work as a labourer at a construction site opposite the widow’s house. As he found out that the victim lived alone, he plotted the crime,” Kothara police station sub-inspector V B Kothiya said.
