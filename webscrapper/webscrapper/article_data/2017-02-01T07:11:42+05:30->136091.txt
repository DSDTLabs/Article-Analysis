SURAT: Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) leaders on Tuesday threatened to give a call for bandh in the city if those arrested despite not being involved in rioting in Godadara are not immediately released. VHP wanted   (IPC) section 307 — attempt to murder — be removed from the complaint lodged after riots erupted in the area over a calf’s head whose killing they wanted to be thoroughly investigated. 

 Police had booked 43 people on attempt to murder charges after five cops and a cameraman in the police team were injured in stone pelting by the crowd. “No one tried to kill anyone. This was a spontaneous reaction of the crowd and a few people were injured during the protest. Police should only book the accused on attempt to murder charges if anyone is found involved in it during the course of their investigation,” said  , VHP secretary, Surat.
 
 The police later dropped section 307 from the complaint and claimed that it was done even before the VHP made a demand for it.
