NEW DELHI: Delhi’s peak power demand crossed the 6000 MW mark on Tuesday, clocking 6021 MW — highest this year. The number marks the season’s highest power-demand so far. Discoms estimate this year’s peak power   may reach record 6600MW.

 With   levels reaching record levels, the power demand has been record levels as well. In April, the demand touched 5685 MW — the highest ever power demand recorded in April. It was a whopping 18% more than the peak power demand recorded in April (4797 MW) last year. Similarly, last month it was the first time ever that the peak power demand in the capital crossed the 4000 MW for March, an increase of over 14% from the peak power demand in the month for last year (3617 MW).
 
 Delhi consumes the maximum power among the major cities of the country. Currently hovering around 6000MW, the capital’s peak power demand is thrice as much as of Kolkata (around 2100 MW), 4 times that of Chennai (1500-1800MW) and as much as 60% higher than financial capital Mumbai (3700MW). The power appetite of Delhi is nearly two and a half times the power of seven North Eastern states draw together, which is around 2500 MW.
 
 Higher power demands have been attributed to growing population, rising standard of living and exceptionally hot weather. Starting from 2MW in 1905, 27MW in 1947 to over 6000MW now, Delhi’s electricity appetite has grown exponentially.
 
 Power discoms   and BSES claim that ample arrangements have been made to source adequate power to meet the peak power demand of Delhiites this year. These arrangements include long term PPAs and banking arrangements with other states.
