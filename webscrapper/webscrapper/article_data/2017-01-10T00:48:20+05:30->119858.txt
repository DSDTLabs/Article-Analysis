CHENNAI: The Semmencherry   illegally detained a 16-year-old boy, for his alleged involvement in a cellphone theft, and six of his friends at the police station for nearly eight hours on Monday, parents of the children claimed. 

 Police beat them up and did not produce them before the juvenile justice board as mandated, the parents added. 
 
 The seven boys, in the 16-18 age group, were picked up from their houses in the wee hours of Monday, while a suspect, Hari, 18, managed to escape.
 
 Police said   footage from a mobile phone store in the locality showed Hari and the 16-year-old breaking open the shutters, stealing six phones and fleeing. After a probe revealed that the duo distributed the phones to six of their friends, the others were picked up, police said.
 
  (name changed), grandmother of the 16-year-old, said two policemen came to her house early in the morning and asked for her grandson. "They claimed he was involved in a burglary. We don't know if the allegations are true," she said.
 
 Another parent said her son was not involved in any crime. "But policemen beat him up asking him to hand over the phones. He had scars on his face," she said.
 
 Police denied hitting the boys. "One boy was sent to the   observation home and the others were allowed to leave after the phones were recovered," said an officer.
 
 A case was registered under IPC sections 461 (dishonestly breaking open receptacle containing property) and 380 (theft in dwelling house).
