Nagpur: After state government it is the turn of Central government to deny Nagpur Metro its due share of funds. Against a demand of Rs2,100 crore, it has been sanctioned only Rs1,507 crore in Union budget for 2018-19. 

 The project-wise allocation was decided by Union finance ministry this week. Earlier, state government had sanctioned only Rs310 crore against a demand of Rs850 crore.
 
  officials are, however, buoyed by the Central allocation for Nagpur and Pune Metros. “The total budgetary allocation for the two Metro projects is Rs2,829 crore as compared to Rs1,850 crore allocated in 2017-18, which means an increase of Rs979 crore,” a Metro official said.
 
 “Of the Rs1,507 crore allocated by Centre for Nagpur, Rs279 crore is equity, Rs185 crore as subordinate debt (SD) towards central taxes and Rs1,043 crore as pass through assistance (PTA) against KfW and AFD loan. The fund allocated by Centre for Nagpur Metro in 2017-18 was Rs. 1,350 crore. Thus Nagpur project has got an additional allocation of Rs. 157 crore as compared to last year,” he further said. 
 
 The official also said that MahaMetro was confident that the project would get additional state and central allocation through supplementary demands in monsoon and winter sessions.
