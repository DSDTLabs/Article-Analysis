KOLKATA: The Sunday morning temperature in Kolkata was a little above 10 degrees - the kind of temperature where an average Kolkatan would think twice to even come out of the warm quilt, forget heading for a marathon. But 12,000-odd people from Kolkata did just that - waking up at 5am and turning up at the   by 6.30am to participate in a half marathon by   to spread awareness about safe driving.

 There were three categories - 21km and 10km for the pros and 5km for the fun runners. The races were flagged off by Kolkata Police commissioner Rajeev Kumar in presence of celebrities like Sayantika and Subhasree and junior sports minister Lakhsmiratan Shukla. On the 'Safe Drive Save Life campaign', Kumar said: "Since the start of the campaign, accidents have dropped by 25%. It is a major achievement and the fact that so many people have come to attend the marathon today shows the popularity of our campaign and that we are on the right track." 
 
 Pro runners from Bengal as well as from other states were the first to take the stride taking part in the 21km race that started at 6.30am with over 2,000 participants. "For me, today was a test of my own endurance and capabilities and I am happy that I succeeded in completing a marathon with pro runners in less than one and half hours," said Alipore resident Nidhi Bhartia. Among the men, Rishikesh Chakraborty, Manas Das, Lakhmikanta Mahato and Tarak Mandi were the top four finishers. Among women, Sabina Khatun, Puja Adhikari, Sanghamitra Mahato and Anjali Saraogi were the top four runners. 
 
 After half an hour, the 10km run was flagged off that was attended by another 4,000 participants and around 8.30am, the 5km run was kicked off that had the most participants - around 6,000.
