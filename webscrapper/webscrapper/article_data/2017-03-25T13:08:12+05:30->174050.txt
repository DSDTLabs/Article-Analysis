Porvorim: The people of state will have to spend more on petrol with the state government on Friday deciding to hike   (VAT) on the fuel to 15% from 7%, a move expected to generate a revenue of around Rs 125 crore. 

 Petrol that costs about Rs 60.37 per litre, will now be priced at Rs 65 per litre, which is what it was when the   took over the reins of the government in 2012. In April 2012, the government had reduced VAT on petrol from 20% to 0.1% as a relief measure to the common man reeling under the strain of the constantly rising petrol price.
 
 Chief minister  , in his budget speech, said that his government maintained its promise made to the people in 2012 all through its five-year term, ensuring that the price of motor spirit, petrol, did not cross the threshold level of Rs 60 per litre. 
 
 “It is time to review this measure in view of the enhanced spending and provisions made for various existing and new initiatives in the budget. I propose to enhance the rate of VAT on motor spirit to 15%,” Parrikar said and pointed out that despite this, the price of petrol in Goa will remain significantly lower compared to that in the neighbouring states of   and   where the fuel is sold for Rs 72 and Rs 76 per litre, respectively.
