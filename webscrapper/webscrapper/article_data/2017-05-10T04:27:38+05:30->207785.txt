VADODARA: An offence of forgery was registered against cash-for-marks scam accused and founder of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth Dr   Shah and D K Parmar, talati of   village of Waghodia taluka, at Waghodia police station on Monday. The investigations of the case have been handed over to local crime branch (LCB).

 Ashit Amin, a resident of Harni Road, told police in his complaint that Shah had bought a land bearing survey number 336 for his medical college from Govind Patel in August 2004 according to the sale deed. 
 
 However, Shah, as managing trustee of K M Shah Charitable Trust got it registered in the revenue records in July 2002 with the help of Parmar.
 
 Police said Amin holds power of attorney of land owned by his wife and is near the piece of land bearing survey number 336. 
 
 Amin also told the cops that Shah because of his influence had also blocked the approach to his land.
 
 Amin has claimed that Shah used these records to get permission for his medical college from   (UGC). Amin had filed an   application at   to know the details of Shah’s permission for his college. 
 
 Amin learnt through the RTI documents about illegality in ownership of the land.
 
 Police said Amin has claimed that Parmar wrote letter to Shah on official letterhead of Pipadiya gram panchayat that land bearing different survey numbers, including 336, is owned by K M Shah Charitable Trust. 
 
 “Since the sale deed was done in August 2004, the letter given by Parmar to Shah in 2002 was illegal and Shah used it for his vested interest,” said a police official.
 
 “We are collecting evidences supporting Amin’s claims. Once we do that we will seek Shah’s remand with the help of a transfer warrant,” said LCB police inspector Vijay Joshi.
