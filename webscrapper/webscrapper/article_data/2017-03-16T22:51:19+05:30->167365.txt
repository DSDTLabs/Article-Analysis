Hyderabad: In yet another power boost to the manufacturing sector in Telangana, Gujarat-based Tirth Agro Technology Pvt Ltd, that manufactures farm equipment under the brand ‘Shaktiman’, has inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Telangana government to set up a centre of excellence and manufacturing facility for farm machinery in Telangana. Currently, the company has a manufacturing base in Rajkot. The CoE-cum-manufacturing facility, which is expected to come up on 200 acres on the outskirts of Hyderabad at a cost of Rs 150 crore, is expected to become operational in the next 18 months, top Telangana government officials said. The facility will manufacture rotary tillers, power harrows, mechanical seed drills and compost shredders, among others, and will also have dedicated plots for field demonstration, horticulture and water harvesting. 

 The proposed plant will generate direct employment for 500 people and indirect employment for around 1,500 people. Tirth Agro Technology chairman Ashvin Gohil said the manufacturing hub in Telangana will boost its business in the south. “The proposed CoE aims to improve the process of farming with the introduction of advanced techniques and will also work in the area of skill upgradation,” he said in a statement.
 
 The company claims to be one of the largest manufacturers of farm machinery in India with a market share of over 50%. It has over 625 dealers and 46 distributors across the country and also exports to over 77 countries. The company clocked revenues of Rs 725 crores in 2016-17. State IT E&C, MAUD, industries & commerce, mines & geology, public enterprises and NRI affairs, K T Rama Rao, who was present at the MoU signing ceremony, said the government will provide all the necessary support to the company for setting up its CoE and manufacturing plant in the state.
