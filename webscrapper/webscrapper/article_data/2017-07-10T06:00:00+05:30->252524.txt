Theatre lovers of Hyderabad were in for a treat of a different kind on Saturday. Presenting a autobiographical musical mono-act,  , the 80s’ pop diva, offered her life story to the people of Hyderabad — unadulterated and embellished with real-life anecdotes that many didn’t know, until then.

 Titled That’s Life, Sharon’s performance gripped the audience from the word go and evoked nostalgia about the heydays of 80s Indi-pop culture. As she chronicled her journey to stardom and aptly decorated it with songs, the packed hall patiently followed her lead and became witness to her life as it were. 
 
 Organised by   to commemorate the 33rd death anniversary of the legendary theatre personality, the show was one of the two plays staged during the weekend as a part of the ‘Theatre weekend’ initiative.
