GHAZIABAD: An examination of   footage obtained from the area in Sahibabad where a 60-year-old Delhi-based trader was shot dead on Monday have revealed that two men on a Pulsar motorcycle had opened fire at the victim.

 Police said they were yet to identify the two men as they had their heads covered with helmets but they seemed to be in their mid-20s. Police are yet to ascertain the motive behind the   of Anil Khera, a supplier of chemicals to processing industries in Ghaziabad who was shot dead in Rajendra Nagar Industrial Area. 
 
 Khera owned a chemical and colours supply store in   in Delhi and lived in Model Town along with his family.
 
 The cops said they were trying to find out if any extortion call had been made to him.“Our teams have tried to speak to the deceased’s family members. But they are in a state of shock. If it was a case of old enmity, it’s his family members who would be able to shed light upon it. As of now, we haven’t explored the angle of extortion by any particular gang as there were no such calls made to him. The call records of Khera’s mobile phone are being examined,” deputy superintendent of police Rakesh Mishra said.
 
 Police had registered an FIR on Monday on the basis of a complaint by Khera’s trading partner Sushil Tiwari. Khera was shot dead outside Tiwari’s factory in Sahibabad.
