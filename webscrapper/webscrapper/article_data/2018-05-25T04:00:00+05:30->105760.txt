Surat: The Hindu woman from Valod of Tapi district who had eloped with a Muslim man from Palsana police station limits of Surat district was brought back by police from Ajmer in Rajasthan on Thursday. 

 The woman was sent to Women Shelter Home (Nari Sanrakshan Gruh) in the city. The man, who too was brought to the city, has been arrested by police under Section 151 to prevent him from committing a cognizable offence.
 
 Surat rural police brought Sejal Patel (22), a resident of Valod, and Mohammad Nawaz Hanif Malek (24), a resident of Bardoli in Surat, from Ajmer. A missing report was filed by Patel’s family at Palsana police station after she went missing on May 6. Her family had received a notarized document informing them about her marriage in Malegaon of Maharashtra, police said. 
 
 Patel’s family and Hindu Jagran Manch (HJM) activists were pressurizing police to bring back the woman who is suspected to have been abducted by Malek. They had even organized a rally in Vyara, the district headquarters of Tapi, and staged dharnas outside Valod and Palsana police stations.
 
 “The woman wanted to stay at the shelter home before deciding her future course of action. We sent her to the shelter home and arrested the man to prevent any disturbance in the area. He was released on bail after completion of the formalities of arrest,” said G I Vasava, deputy superintendent of police, Surat.
