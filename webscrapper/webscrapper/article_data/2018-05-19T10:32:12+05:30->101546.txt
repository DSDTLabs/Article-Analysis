SHAHKOT: Former   and a ticket aspirant for the Shahkot assembly by-elections,  , on Friday joined the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). Party president   visited Lalli’s residence in Kang Khurd village to welcome him to the party fold. 

 Lalli was the only Congress MLA from the Shahkot constituency in the last 40 years. However, he won the seat in 1992 after all factions of Akali Dal had boycotted the polls. He remained minister of state for home affairs. He was a contender for the ticket this time too. Irked, after being overlooked, he preferred staying away from campaigning for the Congress candidate, Hardev Singh Laadi. 
 
 Justifying his switching of sides, Lalli claimed he was leaving the Congress because of undue interference of former minister Rana Gurjit Singh in the area. He said several Congress MLAs and leaders including him, met chief minister Amarinder Singh and asked him to rein in Gurjit, but to no avail. 
 
 He said he was also disillusioned with the Congress after it gave the ticket to a known ‘sand mafia kingpin’ Laadi. “We requested the party to give the ticket to anyone but Laadi. However the party persisted in giving the ticket to the sand mafia kingpin,” he alleged. He also paraded a number of people who, he claimed, were victims of Laadi’s persecution. 
 
 The former minister also expressed his disappointment with Amarinder for being inaccessible. “This has demoralised the party rank and file and it is another reason why I left the party which I have served to the best of my abilities for forty years”, he added. 
 
 Badal, on his part said that Lalli will strengthen the party. Several SAD leaders including party candidate, Naib Singh Kohar were present on the occasion.
