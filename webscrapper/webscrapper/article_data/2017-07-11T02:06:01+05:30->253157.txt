DARJEELING/KOLKATA: The Centre has become a punching bag for both West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and the   (GJM) even as they are opposed to each other over the demand for a separate   state. 

  While Mamata accused the Centre of "non-cooperation" saying that it was sitting on the state's requisition for additional forces as the bandh enters its 27th day on Tuesday, GJM's Darjeeling MLA Amar Singh Rai gave vent to his fret over the Centre's "wait-and-watch" policy instead of calling Hills parties for talks over Gorkhaland. 
 
 The MLA feared that the situation might slip out of the Centre's hand. Rai doesn't foresee any relaxation in the Hills strike in the Gorkhaland Movement Coordination Committee meeting on Tuesday unless the Centre arranges for talks with Hills parties. 
 
  Mamata saw in the Centre's reluctance a "conspiracy" against Bengal. "There is a conspiracy to divide Bengal which is why the Centre isn't coming to the state's help in tackling the situation," she said on Monday.
