JAIPUR:   state president   said on Friday that the prime minister promoting   was a risky move as the firm's majority shares were with a company from China, a country with which India's relations were strained.

 “Prime Minister   is talking of cashless economy and promoting Paytm, which is very risky as its 60% shares are with China ( ) and with which India's relations are not good.Sharing information about our bank accounts with such a nation is not a sensible thing to do,“ Pilot said, addressing a huge public gathering at Sardarshahar in Churu district.The rally was part of Congress's nationwide protests against demonetisation.
 
 Pilot claimed that the large turnout of people at the Congress rallies at Baran and Churu (Sardarshahar) showed how much the common man was agitated against demonetisation or “note ban“. He said that having given an unprecedented mandate to   in last general and assembly elections, the people were feeling cheated as the Centre and state governments were least bothered with the common man's issues.
 
 “There is no law that bars you from withdrawing your money from banks. But the rules framed by this government have harassed people by not letting them withdraw own money ,“ Pilot told the gathering. The Congress state president said the black money that the government clai med to have received through demonetisation should be used to waive poor people's loans.
 
 Targeting the Vasundhara Raje-government, Pilot said, “Despite having a woman chief minister, the state is witnessing rise in crime against women. Minor girl's rape in Churu is latest example.“ The Congress leader said the state government was preparing to close down 3800 schools. He added, “The CM hopes to remain in power for 15 years but considering her functioning it is doubtful if she will outlast 15 months.“
