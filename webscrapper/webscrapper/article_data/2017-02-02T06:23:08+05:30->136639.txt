NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old woman was arrested from north Delhi’s Kashmere Gate for allegedly faking the kidnapping of her 18-month-old daughter to   her neighbour in a false case.

 On Saturday, the police received a call around 10.30pm about the girl’s kidnapping. Her mother alleged in a complaint that her daughter had disappeared while playing outside her home around 9pm. She accused her neighbour Naseem of kidnapping her daughter. She told the cops that he had threatened her earlier over some dispute.
 
 When the neighbours were questioned, they said that they had seen the woman leaving with her daughter and a man on the night the child was kidnapped. When she returned home, her daughter wasn’t with her.
 
 Soon, the police got information that a man had been detained at Old Delhi railway station with a girl child. The man, Shiv Ram alias Lambu, told cops the woman had conspired with him to kidnap her daughter so that she could implicate Naseem to settle an old score.
 
  “She had even filed a false complaint against Naseem for intimidating her,” said DCP (north) Jatin Narwal. Lambu said that the mother had asked him to take her daughter outside Delhi.
