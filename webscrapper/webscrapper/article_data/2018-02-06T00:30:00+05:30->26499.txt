Nagapattinam: Two priests of a temple in Mayiladuthurai in the district were dismissed on charges of performing a ritual, allegedly deviating from the tradition being followed. They were reportedly asked to leave the job after being found making up the main deity of the temple with churidar using sandal paste.

 Sources said that Ambalavana Desiga Paramacharya Swamigal, the head of Thiruvavaduthurai Adheenam mutt, has ordered the termination of priests Kalyanasundaram, 75, of South Ramalinga Street in Mayiladuthurai and his son K Raj, 45. The temple superintendent S Gurumurthi issued an order declaring their termination on Monday.
 
 The authorities said that the two acted against agama, an age-old rules mandating sari to dress up the goddess. Kalyanasundaram has been working as a priest for the last 50 years while his son Raj joined as a priest hardly six months ago, sources from temple said.
 
 The priests had adorned the goddess Abayambigai Ambal with a churidar on February 2, an auspicious day in the Tamil month of Thai, after making up the idol with sandal paste. However, the move landed them in trouble after a photograph of it went viral on social media.
