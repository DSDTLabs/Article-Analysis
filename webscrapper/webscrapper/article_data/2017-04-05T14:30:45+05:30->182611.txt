PANAJI: Enjoying the beach and experiencing Goa's waters will be a novel experience for many wheelchair users at the first of its kind   beach festival in the state that begins on Wednesday. 

 The five-day BeachFest2017 will transform the   stretch into a completely accessible beach permitting wheelchair users to indulge in water sports including beach bowling, wheelchair cricket, kite flying, sand castle competitions and wheelchair dancing, along with their able bodied family members and friends, in a completely inclusive experience. 
  
 Organised by UMOJA, an online travel platform for persons with disabilities, the fest will see a number of outstation delegates travelling to Goa for the occasion. 
 
 Entrepreneur and disability rights activist from Mumbai Neenu Kewlani is looking forward to the experience and hopes the country can move towards accessibility for all. 
  
 Writer Frederika Menezes from Panaji admits she has visited the beach only once in her adult life as the lack of any ramp or beach mat makes it impossible for her to access the beach and its waters. 
 
 A ramp has already been installed at Candolim beach and a number of senior citizens, wheelchair users and mothers with prams have begun already using it. Participants will also get the opportunity to experience Goa's waters in a special floating wheelchair imported from France. 
  
 Mohammed Shams Alam Shaikh, a national para swimmer, is expected to break a Limca World Record on April 8 to prove that barriers for persons with disabilities can be overcome.
