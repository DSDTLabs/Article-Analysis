Panaji: The abundance of sardines and mackerels in the market has resulted in a reduction of prices of fish. On Monday, sardines were being sold at Rs 50 per kg as opposed to Sunday’s price of Rs 100 per kg. Meanwhile, 10 mackerels were being sold at Rs 100, which until a day ago, one could buy just six to eight mackerels at that rate.

 Experts have attributed the reason for the abundant availability of these pelagic species to favourable wind conditions.
 
 “In December-January there was a drop in the catch of mackerel and sardines because of the winter temperature. Right now, the wind direction is towards the estuary, which means it is a favourable atmosphere for fish catch. We still have to discuss with   if there is any other phenomenon,” said a fisheries scientist from  ,  .
 
 The positive impact of this bountiful catch could be seen in the local market with vendors selling shoals of fish to enthusiastic consumers.
 
 “Last week was slightly drab for us, but Monday onwards there has been an excessive supply of fish in the market. While the rates of most other fish have also reduced slightly, sardines and mackerels being staple fish fare have attracted customers more,” said one of the fish vendors.
 
 While locals sampled the affordable fish and vendors made  , fishermen however were not very content with the parameters of fish they had caught.
 
 “The winds are in our favour. There has been a  , but we were waiting for a bumper catch. Since the season for these two fish varieties is nearing the end, there is no hope for a bumper catch of sardines and mackerels anymore. Of the ones we have caught in abundance, most are small in size and not so tasty either,” said   of the Goa fishing boat owners’ association.
