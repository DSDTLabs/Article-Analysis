NEW DELHI: National   ( ) has approached high court for an early order on a petition which has held up award of work to widen a crucial portion of  , the main highway connecting Delhi with Uttar Pradesh. 

 The   had held the final hearing in December on the petition filed by a road developer, who was disqualified by NHAI during the bidding process for the stretch between Delhi border and Dasna. But the court has reserved its order.
 
 This 19.3km stretch is very congested and passes through residential and commercial areas such as Indirapuram and Noida Sector 62. 
 
 NHAI has kicked off the ambitious   of Nizamuddin Bridge-Hapur section to decongest the road. It has divided the stretch into three sections for faster execution. While Nizamuddin Bridge to Dasna will be made 14 lanes, Dasna to Hapur will be widened to six lanes. 
 
 Work on Nizamuddin Bridge to Delhi border and Dasna to Hapur have started. The remaining portion — Delhi border to Dasna — is yet to be awarded.
 
 This time, when NHAI received three bids and was ready to award, one of the bidders dragged the highway authority to the HC challenging its disqualification during the technical biding stage. 
 
 TOI has learnt that NHAI has two options. First, if the order goes in its favour, the work can be awarded to the lowest bidder. The present bids have been received to execute the work on public private partnership (PPP) mode. After getting the contract, the company has to get finance in six months to execute the project. Sources in the government said the second option is that the highway authority may invite bids again under another mode where the government foots the bill and work can start quickly. 
 
 PM Narendra Modi has set a deadline of December 2018 to complete the work.
