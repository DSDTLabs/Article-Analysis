CHENNAI: At a time when many bus passengers are stranded on roads and bus terminals or coughing up huge sums to autorickshaws and share autos, a section of MLAs are enjoying free trips from the   hostel in   on   to the secretariat.

 A senior MTC official said six buses from different depots will come to the hostel around 8.30am to transport the MLAs. Generally less than half a dozen MLAs and a large number of their guests and relatives travel in these buses. Interestingly all these buses are brand new ones which are not operated on the MTC routes. 
 
 Operation of services from the hostel to the secretariat has been in force for more than four decades, said a senior MTC official.
