GANDHINAGAR/RAJKOT: Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani is taking his constituency Rajkot rather too seriously. From inaugurating a private two-wheeler showroom to presiding over a function to beautify a garden, Rupani doesn’t miss any opportunity to visit Rajkot. There are whispers in the senior   that instead of trying to reach out to every corner of the state in an election year, the CM is focusing too much on his constituency. 

 BJP leaders say the perception that CM is favouring a particular region over others may harm prospects of the party.
 
 Recently, he inaugurated a Wi-Fi facility at Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) stop. “It is good that he is actively in touch with people in his constituency. But, all 182 constituencies equally need his attention. After all, he is the chief minister of Gujarat and not Rajkot,” said an officer adding, “he has attended fewer Swagat Online Grievance Redressal meets, as compared to his predecessors Narendra Modi and Anandiben Patel.”
 
 His supporters however say that Rajkot, a traditional BJP bastion, is going to witness an intense fight due to Patidar agitation. “The CM doesn’t want to take any chances,” they say.
 
 Besides his visits to Rajkot, many in the corridors of power are not appreciating the excessive presence of the CM’s family and friends, particularly his nephew Mehul and an aide Rajesh Gandhi, in the CMO. 
 
 “It is not appreciated in BJP. Even Anandiben Patel faced the music because the top leadership felt her family was trying to interfere in government decisions.”
