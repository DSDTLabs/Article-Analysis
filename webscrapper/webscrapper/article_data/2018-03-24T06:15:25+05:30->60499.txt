KOLKATA: The state’s proposed restrictions on fee hike were greeted with scepticism by city schools, many of whom felt it could stunt their growth and undermine their autonomy.

 Senior management staff of a school run by the   ( ) , for instance, feared that they might find it difficult to maintain the old school building which has a heritage status. “We spend crores on upkeep. We also provide free education to financially weak students. How can we run a school if we decide to increase only 10% development fee every year?” he asked.
 
 A senior school principal pointed out that salary of staff, yearly increment and the enhanced government DA were an addition to its expenses, apart from the house rent allowance for teachers. “How can a school, which pays for all of this from the students’ fee, afford a mere 10% development fee hike every year. We have several school buildings which need upkeep. It is not possible to implement such decisions without uniform consent from schools,” he said.
 
 Some schools with minority status protested the government’s possible decision to “impose” the fee cap. Sources said they are worried of the state trying to breach their autonomous status as they are only governed by the set of rules framed by the church and do not even come under the RTE Act, 2009.
 
 A school which had initially sent a representative to the self-regulation commission said they were not keen to implement the decision till the Church takes a call.
 
 Another school principal, however, welcomed the initiative. . But he felt that the new structure should not be imposed. “Let the state create a neutral accreditation body which can determine fee. If schools satisfy norms then they should be graded and allowed to charge fee as per the grade. A general slab can’t be fixed for schools,” he said.
