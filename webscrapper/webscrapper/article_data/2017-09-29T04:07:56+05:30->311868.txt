New Delhi: North   has developed a   mechanism involving citizens to improve   services in its areas. 

 Through its zonal offices, the corporation has distributed detailed forms among market associations and RWAs for their feedback on sweeping of roads, lifting of garbage from dhalaos, and upkeep of urinals and public toilets. “We want to involve citizens in governance to improve the efficiency and output of sanitation services being given by the corporations,” said mayor  .
 
 The feedback forms can also be submitted online through the north corporation website. “The forms can be sent to deputy commissioner in the zones by post or through emails, or can be uploaded on the corporation’s website,” said north corporation spokesperson  .
 
 RWAs often complain of construction waste being dumped at dhalaos, sanitation workers not doing their jobs properly, etc. “The complaints are very important for the improvement of services. Since there is no mechanism to go through them, the issues are not resolved. This system to deliver the complaints to corporation officials will help in finding solutions,” said an official.
 
 The feedback forms can also be used to register complaints or inform the corporation about habitual offenders. The corporation will take action against violators on the basis of the complaints made through the feedback form, said the mayor.
