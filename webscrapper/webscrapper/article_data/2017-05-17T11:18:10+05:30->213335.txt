MUMBAI:   edged past   by two runs in a thriller to enter the final of the Abis Rizvi Champions Trophy Super-8 College T20 Cricket Tournament.

 In the semifinal, the InterCollege winners Rizvi failed to overhaul Ruparel's innings score of 160 and were restricted to 158 all out in 20 overs, thanks to some tight bowling from Ruparel at the death.
 
 In the other semifinal,   beat   by eight runs in a low-scoring affair played earlier at the same venue. Jhunjhunwala bowled out Khalsa for 90 who were chasing a meagre target of 98 in 20 overs. Ruparel will play Jhunjhunwala in the final at the   ground on Wednesday afternoon.
