AHMEDABAD: Patidar quota stir leader   on Tuesday sought anticipatory bail from the city sessions court in connection with the FIR lodged with   on   against him and 59 other agitators.

 As the probe has been transferred to the city crime branch, Patel, on Monday, went along with 12 other supporters to surrender in this case. However, he was not arrested because the investigating officer was out of station. In his bail plea filed through advocate Rafik Lokhandwala, Patel has contended that police does not want to arrest him at present, but he fears that he could be arrested at a crucial time when he undertakes a movement. It has also been contended that if he is arrested now, he may go to an appropriate court for bail proceedings. But since, police seem intent on disrupting his future programme, they may apprehend him. The court issued notice to the investigating officer and kept March 31 for hearing on the anticipatory bail plea.
