PATNA: State water resources department ( ) minister   alias   said in the state assembly on Thursday that the department would complete 421 anti-erosion and   fighting schemes by June 5, after which the flying squads will conduct intensive on-the-spot inspections to assess the quality of work performed.

 “If the quality of work is found to be sub-standard, action will be taken against the engineers and executing agencies concerned. The flying squads will complete the inspection work before the onset of monsoon,” Singh said.
 
 He added a Rs 90.97 crore project has been prepared to save Sitabdiara village in Saran district, the birthplace of Jayaprakash Narayan, from floods. Singh said this while giving reply to the House debate on the WRD budget of Rs 3,497.38 crore, which was passed. RJD member Bhola Yadav had moved the cut motion to initiate the debate, while RJD, Congress and CPI(ML) members walked out of the House during Singh’s reply.
 
 The minister said the WRD would soon start implementing the phase-III of Bagmati embankment construction project, whose completion will go a long way in saving Begusarai, Khagaria, Darbhanga and Samastipur districts from annual flood menace.
 
 He said the World Bank-aided Mathematical Modelling Centre of Excellence would come up near the Birpur Kosi barrage in Supaul district by November this year. “The centre will help in giving advance warning or alert regarding the flow of water in the downstream of the Kosi during flood season,” the minister added.
