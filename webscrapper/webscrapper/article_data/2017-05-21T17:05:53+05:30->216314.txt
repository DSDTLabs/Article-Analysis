BENGALURU: A helping hand from compatriot   at the 7-km mark appeared to have benefitted world cross-country champion  , who turned on the afterburners to leave her challengers in the wake en route to the women’s title.  , the 2013 champion, turned the clock back to take the honours in men’s section at the   on Sunday.

 The welcome boost of energy came as the leading athletes passed the water station with Cheptai running on the outer side. Chesir, who was on the left, passed the water bottle after taking a sip and Cheptai grabbed it to recharge her batteries.
 
 The Kenyan, now fully rehydrated, never looked back as she ran a blistering pace (7.5 to 8.5 km) in 2 minutes, 25 seconds, gliding through Cubbon Park before crossing the finish line in 31 minutes, 51 seconds. At the halfway stage, Cheptai’s leading bunch of five runners had clocked 16:19s.
 
 "At the 8-km mark, I realized I was running alone and knew that I had a chance to go for the course record but I couldn’t finish with a kick. But then, I was not expecting to win too as this was my international debut on road," said Cheptai. Her effort, the third fastest here, was not enough to beat the course record of 31:46 set by Cheptai’s compatriot Lucy Kabuu in 2014.
 
 Ethiopia’s Worknesh Defafa came a distant nine seconds behind, followed by Helah Kiprop and Chesir in third and fourth place respectively.
 
 The men’s race saw two-time defending champion Mosinet Geremew wilt under the hot and humid conditions as he failed to cope with the revised timings. Like in last year’s race, he was in contention till the half-way mark but this time the Ethiopian failed to shift gears and finished a lowly 10th.
 
 Kiwi Zane Robertson ran out of steam after the 7-km mark as roommates Korio and   upstaged Robertson, who lives and trains in the Kenyan town of Iten. "Before the start I was trying to boost my confidence thinking I could win but the fact is that this was my first race after I recovered from a stress fracture," Robertson reasoned. "I want to come back here again."
 
 It looked as if the weather gods had answered the prayers of the elite athletes on Sunday morning, as an extra layer of cloud prevented the sun from beating down even at 9am. But the rising temperature and humidity took a tool with Korio winning a slow race, clocking 28 minutes and 12 seconds. It only equalled the 10th best time on this course clocked by Kenya’s Nicolas Kerich when he finished second to Korio. This was Korio’s second win to go with two other podium finishes.
 
 "I had prepared hard for this race and was on a mission. The leading pack kept a fast pace so I stayed with the pace-setter. We observed Zane till the halfway mark but then we realized that he was not strong. I told my friend (Stephen Kissa) let’s go," the 27-year-old Korio said and added that the prize money would help him complete the house he was constructing back home.
 
 Kissa, who started as a pacemaker, was all set to grab the second place but was pipped by another Kenyan, Edwin Kiptoo, in the last 50 metres. Ethiopian Mule Wasihun, who was troubled by a stray dog last year, came in fourth.
