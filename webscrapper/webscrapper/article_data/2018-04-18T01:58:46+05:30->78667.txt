NEW DELHI:Looking to contain the adverse fallout of pollbound BJP-ruled states issuing directions to police forces to implement the   verdict “diluting” the SC/ST Act, Madhya Pradesh,   and   have been nudged to become party to the Centre’s review petition in the SC. 

 
 Concerned at Dalit outrage and opposition attacks following the recent SC ruling, the three BJP-ruled states and Tamil Nadu will move the SC. The Centre has maintained that state governments are on board in seeking a recall of the verdict, three weeks after violent protests in several states. 
 
 Following a prod from the BJP leadership, the three party-ruled states revoked their decision and decided to file pleas in the SC. All the states have significant SC/ST populations and the issue could prove damaging with assembly polls coming up at the end of the year and BJP seeking a fourth term in MP and Chhattisgarh. 
 
 The BJP’s action comes even as the Centre has readied an ordinance in case it is not able to convince the court to review its previous order. In its comments so far, the court has said that it has not diluted any provision in cases involving Indian Penal Code offences. It said the law should not be unfair and the presumption of innocence should not be denied to an accused. 
 
 While the Centre has already filed a review petition, a top BJP leader told the media that the party’s central leadership has spoken to chief ministers of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where police chiefs were asked to implement the March 20 order, to move the court with their pleas. 
 
 In Raipur, Chhattisgarh CM   said his government would move the SC while it had also revoked a police department circular on implementation of the verdict. “The state government is affected by the judgment. In Chhattisgarh, it is the responsibility of the government to protect the honour of SCs and STs,” he said. The TN government too announced that it would move the apex court.
