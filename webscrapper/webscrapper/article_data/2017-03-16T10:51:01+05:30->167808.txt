RANCHI: Wing B of the north stand at the   housed a beehive until it was dismantled on Wednesday morning.

 A few bees, though, continued to buzz around in the hope of returning to their abode. After two lacklustre outings against Australia in the first two Tests, Team India skipper   too is keen to rediscover his golden touch. The Indian skipper, though, is happy to be at the centre of the opposition's planning as long as it yields an Indian win. “It does not matter to me honestly. I don't start a series saying `focus on me, write on me or speak about me'. It's not in my control.What is in my control is what happens on the field,“ said Kohli.
 
 With the city set to become the 26th Test-match hosting centre in the country on Thursday, compari sons were inevitably drawn about the pitch with that of Pune and Bengaluru. Asked whether he would attribute India's poor performance with the bat to the pitches, the captain said no.
 
 “Australia batted really well in Pune, where we didn't bat so well.In Bengaluru in the second innings we batted better than them. Even on flat decks, if you are under pressure, you tend to have collapses. On perfectly normal pitches sides have been bundled out for 60-70 runs with pressure from the opposition,“ stated the right-hander.
 
 Stressing on the psychological aspect of the sport, Kohli said, “Test cricket is more mental looking at the external factors. Teams which are mentally strong on those sort of pitches (turners), make all the difference in the end.“
 
 Kohli was also all praise for Cheteshwar Pujara and Rahane.
