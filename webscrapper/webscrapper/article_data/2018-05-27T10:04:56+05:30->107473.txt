ROORKEE: For 70-year-old  , a Hindu shopkeeper from Laksar near  , the month of Ramzaan is the time for keeping a fast like a devout Muslim. Singh has been keeping a ‘roza’ during   for the past 26 years now. Incidentally, during Navratra, he also fasts for nine days since he says he doesn’t see any basic difference between the two faiths. “Whether it is ‘vrat’ as termed by Hindus or roza — the term used by Muslims, these are just ways of self-control and purification of the mind and body,” says Singh who runs a garment shop at the Basedi Tiraha (crossing) in Laksar.
 
  The septuagenarian who has two sons and two daughters, started the practice of keeping roza in 1992 when a Muslim scholar advised him to try it out to bring happiness in his life. “I was quite upset those days as I could not find a suitable match for my daughter. I offered prayers at many religious places and in this connection also visited a dargah near Roorkee where an aalim (scholar) advised me that if I start observing roza during Ramzan, my wish will be fulfilled. As it turned out, his advice worked for me as my daughter got married in 1993.” He added that even though his wish was fulfilled, he decided to continue with the practice.
  
  Accordingly, every year since then, during the month of Ramzan, Singh makes sure to fast while observing the rules followed by other rozedaars. His family, too, is supportive of his gesture.
  
  “My father has been keeping roza without fail since 1992. Every day during Ramzan, he wakes up early in the morning to take sehri (pre-dawn meal) and ends the fast in the company of other roza observers in his shop,” said Pawan, 35, Singh’s son.
