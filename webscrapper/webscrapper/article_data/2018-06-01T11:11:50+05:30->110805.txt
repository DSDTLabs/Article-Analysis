TIRUPUR: VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan on Thursday attributed the BJP’s poor show in byelections held in Kerala, Karnataka, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to the saffron party’s open hatred towards the minorities and marginalised communities.

 “It reflects the growing discontent against the BJP,” he said while addressing the media here. “In Tamil Nadu,   is trying to find its foothold by threatening   and keeping the ruling party under its control. Chief minister   had said he came to know about Thoothukudi police firing only through new channels. Hence, there is a suspicion that the BJP-led central government could have had influence in the incident. The Centre said it was ready to send paramilitary forces to take control of the situation,” he added.
 
 The VCK leader also said there was no faith in the single-member judicial commission appointed to probe the incident. The state government had appointed former justice   to probe the incident. But several allegations have been raised against the commission. “So, special inquiry committee should be appointed,” Thol Thirumavalavan said.
 
 Taking a dig at actor-turned-politician  , who had praised the late CM J Jayalalithaa for crushing anti-social elements with iron fists, the VCK leader said in her tenure seven dalits were shot in Paramakudi incident.
 
 “Both Palaniswami and Rajinikanth are vaguely pointing out that anti-social elements have been responsible for Thoothukudi killings. So, Rajinikanth should submit a written statement about such elements before the police,” he said.
