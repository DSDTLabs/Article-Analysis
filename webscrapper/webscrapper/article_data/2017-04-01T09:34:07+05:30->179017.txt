PANAJI: The Goa   has asked revenue minister   to issue instructions to revoke the suspension orders to government employees who were found reporting late to work, and to consider the suspension period as time spent ‘on duty’, so that it doesn’t “leave any deep stigma on their career”.

  is protesting the suspension of 14 who were not present when Khaunte made surprise visits to the offices of settlement of land records, Mamlatdar office, deputy collector, and block development office in Bardez. 
 
 “The Goa government employees association is not adverse to carrying out surprise inspections to enforce attendance in time so as to deliver timely service to the public. However, please note that suspension is not an appropriate action or punishment for late attendance on one or two occasions,” the association’s letter to Khaunte states, citing Swamy’s Compilation of Central   (Classification Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, which specify when suspension can be resorted to and what action is required to be taken for late attendance when the employee has no casual leave at credit. 
 
 President of the association John Nazareth has stated that suspension is not a recognised penalty and leaves a deep stigma on the careers of government servants. Suspension is ordered as a deterrent to exhibit a firm determination to root out corruption or other grave misconduct, or to prevent the employees concerned from tampering with records, to keep them from accessing official records and pressuring witnesses. 
 
 Chief minister Manohar Parrikar, in his budget speech, announced a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) to do away with lethargic employees.
