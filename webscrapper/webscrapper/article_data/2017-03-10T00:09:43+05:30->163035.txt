Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Thursday suggested that police should as far as possible not interrogate accused charged with petty offences at night. The observation came even as the state claimed that   death cases in   had fallen from 18 in 2015 to 10 in 2016. 

 Most custodial   occur in cases where persons have been accused of petty crimes like theft and chain-snatching, said a division bench of Justices Vidyasagar Kanade and Pukhraj Bora. “As far as possible, such accused should not be interrogated at night as there is a possibility of the police officer exceeding the right given to him,” the judges said. The court said in case it was essential to interrogate at night, it should not be left to lower constabulary, but should be done in the presence of a senior officer. “The idea that it is only through interrogation criminal cases can be cracked is not proper,” said Justice Kanade. The court was hearing a PIL filed by Indian Centre for Human Rights and Law that had raised the issue of increasing custodial deaths in the state.
 
 Additional public prosecutor Mankunwar Deshmukh submitted a note by Maharashtra police that claimed a drop in cases in 2016. “Zero custodial deaths should be the state’s objective,” the court said. Maharashtra has been topping the number of custodial deaths for over a decade and a half.
 
 Deshmukh informed the court that five CCTV cameras had been installed in each of the 25 police stations here that had been selected for a pilot project. But after the  , at an earlier hearing said its orders to cover the entire premises in the range of the CCTV network had not been complied with, the government was placing an order for 412 more. 
 
 The court had in 2014 ordered the government to install CCTVs at all police stations.
