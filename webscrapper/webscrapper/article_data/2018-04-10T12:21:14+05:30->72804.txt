PATNA: The state capital requires at least 2,428 police personnel for regulating traffic, but there are only 742 police personnel to manage thousands of vehicles passing through the city thoroughfares every day.

 According to the   (BPRD) norms, at least one constable is required for every 850 vehicles in a district for proper traffic regulation. In addition, for any capital city, 5% additional constabulary is required. However, according to sources, Patna traffic police is working with the strength which was required 14 years back.
 
 “At that time, there were around five lakh vehicles plying on the roads in Patna district. However, against the sectioned strength of 1,233, only 742 police personnel are available for regulating traffic in the district till January this year,” a senior police official involved in traffic regulation said.
 
 As per BPRD norms, at least 38 inspectors, 150 sub-inspectors (SIs) & assistant sub-inspectors (ASI) and 2,240 constables are needed for traffic regulation in Patna. One SP, three DSPs, two inspectors, 53 SIs, 33 ASIs, 76 havildars and 660 constables and 400 home guard jawans are sanctioned, but only one SP, two DSPs, 42 SIs, 44 ASIs, 42 havildars, 342 constables and 277 home guard jawans are made available to manage traffic in Patna, the officer said.
 
 “Out of the available force, 43 police officers, 33 havildars, 162 constables and 247 home guard jawans have been roped in from either other districts or from   (BMP),” sources said.
 
 “According to the data available with the Patna district transport office, 14,05,261 vehicles of different segments were registered from January 2005 to January this year.
 
 A case study available on IIT Kanpur’s website states that there were 4,384 registered motor vehicles in Patna in 1981 and the number increased 67 times to 2,94,164 in 2001. The study also highlighted the lack of any road network as every individual road changes its characteristics after a short distance.
 
 According to police sources, the city traffic has deteriorated fast in the last couple of years due to heavy pressure of vehicles on its roads while the traffic signals have played almost negligible role in improving the situation. “No major step has been taken to broaden the roads across Patna while uncontrolled autorickshaws and massive encroachments have aggravated the traffic situation in the district,” a senior traffic police officer said. He also said a plan to regulate autorickshaws on different routes was also submitted to the senior officials, but to no avail.
 
 It may be mentioned that the only traffic training school in   is in Jharkhand and   has failed to open any new institute since its bifurcation in 2000.
