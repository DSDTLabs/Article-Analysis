PATNA: The process of admission to PG courses in   ( ) for the new academic session, currently in abeyance owing to certain technical issues, is likely to resume soon. 

 Governor-cum-chancellor   is learned to have agreed to allow the university to continue with the old provision of 80% reservation for PU students in PG admissions for this academic session.
 
 From the next academic session (2018-19), sources said, PU might introduce entrance test for admission to PG courses, making all the seats in different courses open to the students of all the universities in the state and outside. PU has been already holding entrance test for admission to undergraduate courses in its colleges for the last three years.
 
 The quota for PU students in PG admissions was done away with through the admission ordinance revised in 2015. When the PU authorities in 2016 admitted students to the PG courses in violation of the revised ordinance, the chancellor’s office reprimanded the then VC and registrar and directed them not to repeat the mistake in future. 
 
 However, the PU has again got the chancellor’s approval to provide 80% quota to PU graduates in PG admissions for this academic session.
 
 Meanwhile, PU has directed its colleges to prepare a selection list for admission to the three-year degree courses on the basis of marks obtained by candidates in the entrance test. This will be applicable to all the courses, said a notification issued by PU students’ welfare dean   on Friday.
 
 The college principal have also been directed to ensure that the admissions are strictly based on the approved ordinance and regulations as per the sanctioned seats after following the reservation policy of the state government. The PU colleges are in the process of bringing out a revised list of candidates selected for admission, said the sources.
