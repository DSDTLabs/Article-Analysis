 Talking to Timesofindia.com about his health, the comedian had earlier confessed, "Yes, it is true that I am taking a break from the show for sometime as I have not been keeping well. It happens with everyone, you and me, we all go through health issues. I ignored my health in the past, worked back to back, over exerted myself and that's the reason my health has gone for a toss. I can't ignore it anymore, since my film is set for release and have a tough schedule ahead."
