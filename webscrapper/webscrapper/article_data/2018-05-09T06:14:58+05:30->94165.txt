DRI officials found that the main Ludhiana-based supporting manufacturer of the company was non-existent. 
 
 “The company evaded customs duty of Rs 64.76 crore payable on imported goods valued at Rs 231.66 crore due to diversion of 25,684.60 metric tonnes of imported raw material.

He took responsibility for the evasion of customs duty,” said a DRI official.
 
 The official added that the managing partner of the firm has defrauded the exchequer and committed an offence under the Customs Act, 1962. The company allegedly imported 25,684.60 metric tonnes of raw materials including low-density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, high density polyethylene (HDPE) and copper rods between June, 2016 and January this year and started selling it in the open market.
