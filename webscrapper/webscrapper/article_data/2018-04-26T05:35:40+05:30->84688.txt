MUMBAI: Opening another warfront with the Shiv Sena, the BJP-led government rejected 159 out of the 263 amendments suggested by the   to the draft development plan (DP-34).   is the ruling party in the BMC. The government termed only 104 suggestions as genuine.

 
 Most of these amendments were requested by   corporators. A civic source said the government is trying to corner the Sena by blocking their recommendations. The corporators had suggested cancelling the reservation of 35 open spaces, change of designation of 18 plots so that they could be commercially exploited and putting in place various reservations for 65 plots, among other recommendations.
 
 A corporator said the civic body will examine the reason given by the state for the rejection before commenting. However a official involved in the process said that officers from the state government and the BMC discussed each recommendation at length before taking a call on each.
 
 On the other hand, the government accepted 1,966 amendments proposed by the planning committee, which comprised representatives of the state government and the BMC. The panel’s 279 amendments were rejected.
 
 The open plots which the Sena corporators wanted dereserved are for public amenities. A source said the corporators were interested in the plots’ development potential. Last August, TOI had reported about corporators seeking change in open space reservation of plots in Bandra Reclamation, Mazgaon, Vile Parle and Dahisar.
 
 After a draft DP was published in May 2016, the civic chief opened it up for feedback and then sent it to the planning committee for hearings. The draft DP, along with the planning committee’s request for amendments, then went to the BMC’s general body meeting. The general body approved the submitted draft and amendments, and also added 263 changes, before sending it to the state government for final approval last year. The state government added 42 changes before approving the draft on Tuesday.
