MEWAT/GURUGRAM: Plagued by low literacy rate of 54.08%, with over half the total teachers’ posts lying vacant in government schools,   is now trying to make the best of available resources. In the latest effort, the district   department has started a ‘star teachers’ scheme.

 According to district education officer (DEO) Dinesh Shastri, Mewat has 2,128 primary school teachers in 493 primary schools. The sanctioned strength is 3,517, meaning there are 1,389 posts lying vacant. In the first phase of the scheme, the best 45 teachers have been picked to run the pilot project.
 
 Under the scheme, each of the six block level officers and the DEO have been assigned 5-6 star teachers. They have been given the task of improving teaching in their own schools, as well as in 2-3 other schools nearby. The teams will conduct random inspections and analyse the knowledge and performance of the teachers there. On a given day, around 30-40 schools will be inspected.
 
 The star teachers will then share their experiences with under-performing teachers of schools under their charge, to improve teaching methodology. They will also prepare a blueprint of what needs to be changed in these schools, and how to go about it. They will then ensure the plan is implemented.
 
 July 15 has been set as deadline for Phase 1 of the programme, giving the star teachers about two months’ time to bring into effect the changes they want to implement. “A big responsibility is being given to the selected teachers. We are hopeful they will do justice to the work at hand,” DEO Dinesh Shastri said.
