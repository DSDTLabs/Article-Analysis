 The approval came despite opposition from many and on a day when the security cordon of the vice chancellor’s office was breached. While the online test will be conducted across 18 cities, the committee also decided to have an offline version of it in the National Capital Region. 
 
 This will be the first ever online entrance test for the university. “The test for the postgraduate, MPhil and PhD programmes, and nine undergraduate courses will be conducted online for the first time. A lot of people have opposed the proposal but the benefits outweigh the concerns. The online mode will reduce corrupt practices and make the process completely transparent. It will also fast-track the announcement of results,” said Pankaj Garg, member of the standing committee.
 
 A Joint Admission Test (JAM) for MSc is conducted online each year for admission to postgraduate programmes in the IITs and NITs. Similarly, Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) is conducted online for admission to 18 law universities across the country. “These are the top online tests of the country and have been conducted smoothly for many years,” added Garg.
 
 The university decided to have an offline version of the test after opposition from many, including   Students’ Union and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. “Candidates will have the option to go for the offline mode. However, they will have to come to the NCR for that. For the remaining 17 cities, the test will be online,” said Garg.
 
 The online registration for the entrance test will start from May 31. The university is yet to announce the last date of registration and the test schedule, which is is expected on Saturday.
