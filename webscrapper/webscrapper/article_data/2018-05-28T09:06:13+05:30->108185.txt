BELAGAVI: "Our daughter's soul is now consoled," the parents of a woman who died of complications in 2012 after being denied abortion by doctors in   said on Sunday, a day after the country voted to repeal its stringent abortion laws in a landmark referendum. 

 
 "It is a landslide opinion in favour of repeal of the abortion laws that has supported our cause," Savita's father   said. 
 
 One of the key cases influencing the debate on abortion in Ireland was that of dentist Savita Praveen Halappanavar, who died of sepsis in the   hospital after being denied an abortion during a protracted miscarriage in 2012.
 
 The 31-year-old woman's death had triggered a massive debate in that country over the issue of life-saving abortions.
 
 Hailing the result of the referendum, Akkamahadevi, Savita's mother said, "It is also a win for   who took up the mission and created awareness among the Irish people on the unnatural law."
 
 Kitty Holland is a journalist with the Irish times, who broke the story of  's death.
