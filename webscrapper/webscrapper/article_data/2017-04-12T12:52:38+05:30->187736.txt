BHOPAL:  , Bhopal is bracing to improve its infrastructure and increase faculty to house 100 new MBBS seats as desired by the state government.

 Three new five-storeyed buildings have been approved to accommodate for MBBS seat expansion in the college. Expansion of medical seats would be the largest ever in the history of the 62-year-old medical college.
 
 “Decision to recruit new faculty would be backed by speeding up of construction of additional infrastructure. It would make   one of the largest medical colleges in central India,” said GMC dean Dr MC Songra.
 
 According to plan proposed by the college, the existing building is five-storeyed and in the form of a cross, when viewed from top. The three new buildings would come up on open spaces and they would be attached with the existing building, paving the way for new lecture halls and laboratories. 
 
 Associated hospital of GMC – Hamidia hospital – the largest tertiary care health facility in Bhopal is also under redevelopment. Old blocks of the more than 70-year-old structure are being demolished and a 13-storeyed hospital is being built. Overall project funding including a ‘smart hospital’ is expected to cost upwards of Rs 2,000 crore.
 
 Directorate of medical education (DME) officials admitted that until the medical college infrastructure is copmplete, they would not approach   (MCI) for seat expansion for MBBS course. MCI inspection has in the past been critical about lack of space and facilities to cater to existing five batches of MBSS courses, with 150 seats each.
