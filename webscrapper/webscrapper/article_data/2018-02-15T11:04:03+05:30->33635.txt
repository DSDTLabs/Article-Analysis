GUNTUR: A study conducted on national   accidents in the state has found defective engineering methods adopted during the construction of NH-16 (Chennai-Kolkata) a prime reason for frequent accidents taking place there. NH-16 passes through most of the nine coastal districts in the state and sees at least one fatal   a day.

 The state government constituted district-level committees comprising officials from roads and buildings, national highway authority, transport and police departments to study reasons for the bleeding of highways in AP last year. The committees inspected accident-prone spots and held several rounds of discussions before arriving at the reasons for the mishaps.
 
 The state government is said to have compiled data and inputs submitted by the committees recently and sent it to the ministry of surface and road transport authority and   (NHAI) for taking up corrective measures, said sources.
 
 The joint study which was carried out in Guntur district pointed out several lapses in the design and construction of the NH, added the sources. The officials have also pointed out that poor lighting facility particularly when   through a particular town or village is also leading to accidents. “While street lights available in some habitats are dim, there are no street lights in many villages.   is leaving little scope for drivers on highways, little chances to prevent the mishaps,” said a senior official part of the study team.
 
 Officials found that not providing proper access to people residing in the villages located just on the bunds of the NH is forcing them to make irregular entry into the NH resulting in collusion of vehicles on the highway. The team found the need of immediate construction of proper service roads in towns and villages through which NH passes. Students of a private university also took part in the study.
