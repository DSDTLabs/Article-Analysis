CHANDIGARH: City-based architects have urged the UT administration to allow habitable use of basements in commercial buildings.

 
 Keeping the risks like fire hazards in mind, the Chandigarh administration, in its rules/guidelines notified last year, had withdrawn habitable use of basements under all categories.
 
 
 
  
 
 Earlier, the habitable use of basements of shopcum-offices (SCOs) was permissible under certain conditions. However, later, was restricted to storage purposes only.
 
 Stating that there was an acute shortage of commercial space, city-based architect   said that the basements should be allowed for habitable purposes with conditions like having in place two staircases in case of fire emergencies, installation of required fire safety equipment and restriction on partitions.
 
 Meanwhile, on the directions of the   secretary,  , architects had submitted their suggestions for successful implementation of self-certification of building plans.
 
 The architects also raised issues like updation of control sheets; allowing second staircase in SCOs; and re-introduction of provision of full coverage of second floor of SCFs/ SCOs. They also suggested changes in building bylaws pertaining to industrial area.
 
 The city-based architects also stressed on relaxing parking norms pertaining to marla houses. “When building plans of marla houses were previously approved, there was no parking norm.
 
 But now, irrespective of the size of the plots, provision for parking three cars has to be made,” they said. They also called for the need to amend light and ventilation norms.
