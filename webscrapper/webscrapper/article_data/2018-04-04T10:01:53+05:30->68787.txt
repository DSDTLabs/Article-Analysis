BARWANI : A   was filed against Barwani collector before the Indore bench of high court on Tuesday for his alleged failure to prevent illegal construction of   on the premises of Sendhwa fort.

 The petition was filed by bar association former president Ajay Mittal through advocate Ashish Gupta. Mittal said that the high court had earlier clarified in its order on April 4, 2008, that any construction or new construction should be prohibited within the radius of 200 metres of the fort in Sendhwa and collector was shouldered with the responsibility to prevent such constructions. His contention is that despite the HC order the collector failed to prevent construction of Rani Sati temple on the fort premises. 
 
 He said that a team of the archaeological department officials had inspected the Rani Sati Dadi temple and had found the construction illegal. They had ordered the collector to remove the construction. Also, municipality and revenue department officials had submitted in black and white that they had not given permission to the temple committee for the construction.
