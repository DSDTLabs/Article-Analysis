NEW DELHI: Members of   University Teachers’ Association met human resource and development minister   on Thursday over a number of issues like lack of faculty and subsequent seat cut in entry to research-based programmes of the varsity. 

 They explained to him that though the intake of research scholars has increased in 2008-11 after a 54% increase in seats, the standard of research conducted had been maintained, as was evident in the number of awards received by the university.
 
 The minister, however, said that the outstanding work has been done mostly in science schools and not schools of social sciences and humanities. The teachers then pointed out that science schools will also have to face 70% seat cut.
 
 Over recruitment of teachers,   said that admissions will be processed after recruitment of teachers.
 
 “He seemed to believe that   would be doing a round of admissions in December, but we informed him that these were admissions for direct PhD programme and for JNU’s main research courses -- MPhil/ PhD integrated programme -- admissions take place in July,” a statement by the teachers’ association said.
