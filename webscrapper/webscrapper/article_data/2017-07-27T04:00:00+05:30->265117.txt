Rajkot: A dalit woman has accused a factory owner of Gondal Road in Rajkot of raping and blackmailing her. The crime occurred one year ago when, Hemant Pambhar, owner of Sumita Industries in Gokulnagar-4 took the woman to the third floor of his factory and raped her. He also took her nude photographs. 

 “Then, Pambhar started blackmailing the woman with her photographs and coerced her into continuing physical relationship with him. Under duress, the woman was compelled to accompany him to Morbi where he raped her in a hotel. Here too, he clicked her nude photographs,” said an official from Malaviyanagar police station. When Pambhar sent the photographs to the woman’s family members, she decided to lodge a police complaint. Police have booked Pambhar under sections 367 (C) of the IPC and articles 3 (2) (5) and 3 (2) (5-A) of the Atrocity Act, 1989.
