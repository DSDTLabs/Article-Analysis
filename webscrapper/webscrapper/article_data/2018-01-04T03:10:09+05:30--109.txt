MUMBAI: The newly formed   has decided to soon affiliate schools in other states as well. The state education department on Wednesday, through a government resolution, formally established the board which will start in the next academic year with a pilot of 100 schools in the state. Earlier this year, the state started planning to set up the international board to improve the quality of school education.

 After a successful run of the pilot, schools in any part of the world can get themselves affiliated to the board.
 
 “Today, boards from outside the country are so popular and our schools get affiliated to it. We want to be able to provide similar high quality education and once we have perfected the curriculum, we hope schools outside the state and the country will want to affiliate themselves with our board. We expect this to happen the following year,” said  , secretary, school education department.
 
 Currently, only a few schools from   and Diu are affiliated to the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education. Similarly, schools in the Middle East are affiliated to the   state board.
 
 Central boards like CBSE and CISCE too have a few affiliated schools outside the country.
 
 The state has constituted seven committees for the board which will cater to students from pre-primary to class XII. It will be available for schools imparting education in English, Marathi, Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati, Telugu, Tamil and Kannada.
 
 However, the step has not been welcomed by some teachers. “The existing board needs a lot of work and resources for the problems to be fixed. So, instead of the state shifting focus to a new set-up, they must first upgrade to the board that is already catering to lakhs of students every year,” said a former member of the state board.
