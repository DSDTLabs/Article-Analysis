JALALABNAD: A day after a video allegedly showing SAD MP Sher Singh Ghubaya in a compromising situation went viral, deputy CM and SAD president  , Jalalabad, was abuzz with talk about it. While his supporters termed it as a tool to defame Ghubaya, his detractors said it was just another example of the “real character of an old politician“. 

 However, the video has made the Congress and the MP's family rally behind him. Ghubaya, whose son Davinder joined the Congress recently and is contesting from Fazilka on a ticket of the party, got support from his daughters Sukhpreet Kaur and Gurpreet Kaur in the presence of party vicepresident Rahul Gandhi at Jalalabad on Saturday .
 
 Senior Congress leaders, including MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, who is contesting from Jalalabad, accused the Akalis of circulating a “fake CD“.
 
 When asked about the controversial video clip of their father, Sukhpreet and Gurpreet called it a ““conspiracy hat ched by Sukhbir Badal to defame our father and the family“. “He is a clean man,“ he said.
 
 Davinder said the family was undeterred by the “big expose in the eyes of Sukhbir Badal“. “It is only Sukhbir who is indulging in dirty tricks to defame us.We are with our father and know that he is clean,“ he said.
 
 He, however, evaded a reply to his father joining the Congress even as other members of the family had joined the party.
 
 People were spotted watching the video clip while visiting Tinda village under Jalalabad constituency . Tinda's former sarpanch Baldev Krishan said the video was doctored.
 
 “We know Ghubaya. He is innocent and has been defamed for not supporting SAD. We have no doubts that the people will not believe in it,“ he said.
 
 Suhele Wala village resident Mukhtiar Singh, however, said the CD showed the character of top politicians. “The video does not seem to be doctored. If it is, why doesn't the Ghubaya family go to court and find out who is behind its leak?“ he asked.
