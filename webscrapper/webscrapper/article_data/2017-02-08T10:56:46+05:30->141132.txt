KOLKATA: There is no need for a new law to stop   of private and public property, said Justice K T Thomas, the   who was appointed by the   to head a committee to amend the Prevention of Damage to Public Property (PDPP) Act. He was speaking to TOI on Mamata Banerjee government’s decision to bring in such a law as existing laws are enough to plug vandalism, the former judge said.

 The state government, peeved with the recent attacks on cops at Bhangar and Aushgram, announced to bring in a new law in January-end so that those who damage public or private property have to compensate it at market value. The CM planned to amend the West Bengal Public Order Maintenance Act and make the lawbreakers liable to compensate for the damage.
 
 “The Bengal government can take a lesson from what is happening in Kerala. I headed one committee for amending PDPP Act and put my recommendations along with Fali S Nariman, who headed another committee. The SC accepted the recommendations.” The suggestions were for compensation by the guilty for damaging private and public property which will not be more than twice the value of damaged assets. “But for political reasons, the Parliament did not pass the amendment of PDPP Act as political parties are involved in all kind of vandalism,” felt Thomas. 
 
 “However, Kerala HC judge K T Sankaran has circulated my apex court recommendations to the executive magistrates and asked them not to grant bail to any accused in damage of public property case if they have not deposited cash security equivalent to the cost of damaged property. It is refundable if the accused is acquitted,” he added.
 
 The former SC judge said: “This is working like magic in Kerala and in Bengal too, the magistrates can use the SC-accepted recommendations and ask for cash deposits for bail as part of compensation. But it will be better if the Calcutta HC issues a directive.” He suggested police should capture major agitations on video.
