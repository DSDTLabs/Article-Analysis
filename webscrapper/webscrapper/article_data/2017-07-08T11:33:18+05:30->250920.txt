  The   (BSSC), which drew flaks from all quarters due to recent question paper leak scam, will conduct the written examination for the 232 candidates. This will be the first competitive examination the   will conduct after the infamous scam.
  
  The BSSC had advertised for 1,510 SI posts in 2004. The examination was conducted in April 2008 and results were published on May 30, 2008. Altogether 1,299 candidates were selected. However, some candidates moved Patna high court alleging discrepancies in results. After their petition was rejected by the high court, the candidates moved Supreme Court in 2011. Finally, the Supreme Court directed the BSSC in May this year to give these candidates a window for selection against 299 SI posts.
  
  ADG (headquarter) S K   said only those candidates who had appeared for examination a decade back have been allowed to participate in reselection process. He added no relaxation has been given to the candidates in physical tests. “Candidates are being subjected to one mile run within six minutes. The only change would be the written examination in which the candidates would now be asked objective questions only,” he said.
  
  BSSC chairman   said the written examination would be conducted in July itself. “Patna will be the only centre for re-examination,” he added.
  
  “General knowledge and Hindi would be compulsory subjects in written examination. The two subjects will carry 100 marks each. Candidates will have to appear for at least two of 16 optional subjects,” the BSSC chairman added.
