LUCKNOW: The construction of the ISKCON temple at   here began on a colourful note on Wednesday. 

 A group of nine women devotees from abroad, known as Braj Vadhu, dressed in ethnic Indian attire, sang and danced on Krishna bhajans and sholaks from Bhagwad Gita.
 
 ‘Braj Vadhu’ have dedicated their lives in the service of Lord Krishna. Anuradha Devi Dasi, a musician from Europe, said her life transformed after she visited the ISKCON (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) temple in Vrindavan about eight years ago. “I knew nothing about Krishna bhakti. I was taken to Vrindavan by Goramani, the lead vocalist of our group. That day I felt that I was meant to come here and become a Krishna dasi,” said Anuradha. She along with her husband Prabhu travels across the world to present Krishna kirtan at ISKCON centres.
 
 Actor and BJP MP  , who was the chief guest, said Krishna teachings are a source of inspiration for her. “I am an ardent devotee of Lord Krishna and the ideology professed at ISKCON,” she said. “The basic teaching is cleanliness of the soul. If your soul is clean then you will definitely look beautiful,” Malini said. 
 
 Talking about ISKCON’s Lucknow centre, she said besides being an architectural wonder, the temple would also reflect the heritage of Lucknow.
