CHANDIGARH: A special investigation team (SIT) probing the violence that followed the August 2017 rape conviction of   chief Gurmeet  , arrested two more functionaries of the dera on Tuesday. 

 Umed Ram of Fatehabad and   were arrested in Zirakpur, Mohali district.
 
 The duo were planning to escape towards Patiala when the SIT, headed by assistant commissioner of police (ACP)  , nabbed them. The ACP said Umed was in charge of civil works wing of Dera Sacha Sauda and played a crucial role in mobilising crowds to Panchkula ahead of the conviction by a CBI court. 
 
 He was also involved in coordinating the crowds and arranging temporary shelters for the followers who gathered in thousands in Panchkula a few days before the courtâ€™s deicison.
 
 Dheerja was in charge of setting up community kitchens for dera followers who had come to Panchkula. He allegedly coordinated with Chamkaur Singh, the local dera branch in-charge in Panchkula, and Surinder Dhiman, the media in-charge, for providing food from kitchen.
 
 Sources said both accused were associated with Dera Sacha Sauda since 1996 and were loyalists of its head. SIT officers said both accused had attended a meeting of a key committee chaired by Honeypreet Insan on August 17, 2017. They shifted to Panchkula a week before dera followers started arriving in the town.
