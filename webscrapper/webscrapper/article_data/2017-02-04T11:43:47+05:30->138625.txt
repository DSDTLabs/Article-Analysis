GUWAHATI: AIUDF   has come under fire for live-streaming his speech on the contentious   from his seat in the   on Friday. The BJP-led government called the speech, which the legislator streamed on Facebook, "unethical" and " ". 

 Aminul Islam defended his move by saying he wanted more people to hear him speak in the assembly and create more awareness about the subject. "I am not aware if the code of conduct bans live-streaming on Facebook from inside the house, but this will help create awareness. If the speaker says this is wrong, I will not do it," he said.
 
 The speaker, Hitendra Nath Goswami, said, "I can't comment on the matter straight away. I have received verbal complaints from some MLAs and I have asked them to give the complaint in writing, after which I can take a call." The state legislative assembly allows live telecast of the proceedings of the house only during question hour and not beyond. "Telecast of the proceedings can be done only after taking permission," the speaker said.
 
 BJP's parliamentary affairs minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said what Islam did was unethical.
 
 "Even media persons inside the house covering the proceedings do not resort to such unethical behaviour. This live-streaming was worse because his (Islam's) speech was laced with communal overtones. If he says it wasn't wrong, I will inform the speaker," Patowary said.
 
 He added that not all dos and don'ts are in the rule book but the speaker does give new rulings from time to time.
