Madurai: I Kader Batcha, deputy superintendent of police (DSP) from Tiruvallur who has been on run in the idol smuggling case filed a plea before the Madurai bench of the Madras high court seeking anticipatory bail. 

 The case came up for admission before justice A M Basheer Ahamed on Wednesday. The petitioner wanted to adjourn the case, which the court accepted and adjourned it to July 18. 
 
 In his plea, Batcha, 56, said that when he was working as inspector in the idol wing CID in 2008, he unearthed many cases. “I identified one Subash Kapoor, an international kingpin who was involved in idol smuggling cases. Due to it, I had enemies in my own police department as well as from the smugglers side. It resulted in filing of FIR against me,” the DSP said. 
 
 He said, as per the FIR, an ex-police officer sent anonymous petition in 2016 disclosing serious accusation against certain police officers of idol wing CID in 2008. Based on it, the inspector general of police directed preliminary inquiry by one DSP Asok Natarajan. Actually, this was a fully fabricated story made by the police personnel having ill feeling against me, the DSP said. 
 
 He further said, he had not committed any crime during his tenure in idol wing CID. He said that he would be ready to follow the conditions to be imposed by the court and is also willing to appear before the concerned inquiry officer to co-operate with investigation, he said praying for anticipatory bail.
