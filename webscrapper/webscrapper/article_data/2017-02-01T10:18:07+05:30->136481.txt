LUCKNOW: Construction of the city’s first ISKCON ( ) temple will begin from Wednesday. Built at a cost of Rs 60 crore on a 5-acre complex, the temple will be a world-class center for mental peace and spiritualism.

 The construction commences officially after a three-day event comprising devotional activities. Besides seers from different ISKCON centres of the country, the occasion will be graced by film star and   MP Hema Malini.
 
 ISKCON’s Lucknow centre as of now is in Bans Mandi, Charbagh. However, because the management cannot expand the premises and renovate the rented property, the temple is being shifted to Sushant Golf City. The Charbagh centre will be closed from March.
 
 Designed by Premnath, the architect of Mumbai’s ISKCON centre, the temple will comprise two floors. Along with an extensive 16,000 square feet meditation centre, the first floor will have an outlet for spiritual items. The second floor will provide a guest house for devotees. A Ram Temple is also proposed on the premises.
 
 Besides, the temple will have a multimedia centre for preaching Lord Krishna’s ideology and sessions of Bhagawad Gita.
 
 Next to the temple, a cow-shelter (gaushala) will be developed on a half-acre land. Temple president Aparimay Shayamdas said there will be over 200 cows of various species in the shelter. Further plans include production and marketing of milk and cow dung products.
 
 The entire complex will have a balanced 9-metre wide network, main drives and 6-meter sub-driveways with ample of parking space surrounding the premises.
