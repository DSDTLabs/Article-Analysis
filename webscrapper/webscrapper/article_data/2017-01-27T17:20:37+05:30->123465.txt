' ' has been special for director   and   in many ways, and it has equally been keeping fans waiting for a while now. That being said, the film was held up from release during Christmas, and the film strike between producers and exhibitors had turned villain. 

 Now that the strike has come to a close, Dulquer is on cloud nine that finally the audience would get to see the end-product. He recently posted, 'A film we made with so much love and effort. Working tirelessly day and night ! We completed everything including post production before I left for shoot to the US. It was heart breaking to miss Christmas release. To deny all of you any Malayalam films to watch during the holiday season. But as I always believe every film has its own destiny. At long last #JomonteSuvisheshangal is ready for release this Thursday the 19th of January ! Been waiting a long time for all of you to watch the film. Thank you for being patient and for your endless love *(sic).'
