Not all celebrities can pull off runway's risque fashion. But our homegirl,   who's tried her hand at modeling before is a pro at pulling off any outfit with elan. This time she worked a beautiful sheer gown by Marchesa at the 70th annual Cannes Film Festival.
 
 
 
 
 The plum gown was a sheer delight on Deepika's petite body. It seemed like it had a shimmery body suit inside which was beautifully showcased by the see-through fabric. While many may think Deepika likes to play it safe with her fashion choices, we'd like to highlight that pulling of daring sheer or tricky fabrics like satin is anything but easy.
 
  
  
 She may have received flak in the past for her Met Gala look not being in sync with the theme, but there's no doubt that she worked the really 
  and now sheer effortlessly. Her model-esque figure and fictitious smile make it up ever time. 
 
 
  
  
 And she recently gave a statement that she dresses up for herself and that's what makes her special. We are in love with your me-before-you attitude, Deepika. You go, girl!
