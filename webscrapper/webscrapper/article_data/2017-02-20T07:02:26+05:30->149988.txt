AHMEDABAD: In an effort to revive the  , convener of   (PAAS),   will address a   area of the city on February 26. This will be the first major public meeting of Hardik in the city after the   of August 25, 2015. The GMDC rally had triggered widespread violence across the state and claimed 11 lives, including that of a policeman.

 Hardik has announced the PAAS plan of a “mega-show” in this election year. The show includes his public meeting and bike rally at Jamjodhpur on Sunday. This was the first of series of rally planned for the 23-year-old Patel leader in the coming days. 
 
 Similar massive meetings are planned in Dhrol and Lalpur in Jamnagar; Jetpur and Dhoraji in Rajkot; Sayla in Surendranagar; Jesar and Gariyadhar in Bhavnagar; Gadhda in Gir Somnath; and Visavadar in Junagadh. 
 
 “Hardik will address a public meeting in Bapunagar on February 26. A large number of Patidars from across the state will attend it,” said a PAAS member.
 
 Bapunagar was the area where violence was widespread during August 2015 and one youth, Swetang Patel, had lost his life in police custody. The area also has significance due to its diamond units in which Patidars from Saurashtra and Surat are mainly involved in diamond-cutting work. The business here is down because of recession and demonetization.
