JAISALMER: Following rise in incidents of vultures being mowed down by trains in Jaisalmer in last one-and-a-half months, a meeting was held between the railway and forest department officers in which many decisions were taken and action plan to stop such incidents in future and increasing patrolling along the railway tracks was made. It is to be mentioned that in last 1.5 months over 50 vultures of rare species died in five incidents and Union minister   expressing concern over this had spoken to forest department officers.

 DFO Khyati Mathur confirming about the meeting said few days ago in Lathi, Chandhan and Chacha areas of the district, large number of vultures were run over by trains. To stop such incidents, the department had been writing continuously to railway officers. Later, chief conservator of forest and railway DRM, DME and other officers had a meeting in which this issue was raised.
 
 The carcasses lie near the tracks and railway gangman and other employees do not remove them. When vultures prey on them, they get killed by moving trains.
 
 Mathur said that   had assured that their employees will do patrolling to a limit and will throw away the dead cattle at faraway places.
 
 On seeing vultures on track, railway engine driver will try to fly them away by sounding the horn.
 
 Railway local officer Nagesh Meena took the meeting and assured forest department of all possible help.
 
 DFO said that after these incidents, continuous vigil is being maintained along with patrolling. Villagers are being persuaded not to throw dead cattle along the railway tracks. More awareness campaigns will be conducted in future too.
