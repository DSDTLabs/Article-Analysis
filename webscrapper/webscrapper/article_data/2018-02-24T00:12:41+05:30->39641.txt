JALANDHAR: This is not for the first time that   hit the headlines for the wrong reasons. While questions are doing the rounds about his visa to India this time, a major controversy had erupted in 2006 in   which put two Liberal MPs in piquant situation.

 Vancouver North Liberal MP   called up Indian consul general to get Atwal an Indian visa. However when controversy erupted Bell publicly confirmed that he had called up the Indian Consul General in Canada but had done so after being requested by Vancouver South MP Dosanjh. Bell was quoted in Canadian media saying that   had not mentioned about Atwal’s conviction in the case of attempt on life of a minister from India and he was not aware of this fact when he called up the consul general of India. 
 
 Ironically Atwal was accused of assaulting Dosanjh in 1985 but he was acquitted in the case. Dosanjh later became federal minister and British Columbia premier. The attack was said to be due to Dosanjh’s views on the events in Punjab in 1980s. Bell was even quoted by the Canadian media saying that he was aware that Atwal had history with Dosanjh but was not at all aware of his conviction in the case of attempt on the life of a vising minister from India. 
 
 When contacted on phone, Dosanjh told TOI from Canada that Atwal did came to his office for help and his staff communicated to Bell’s staff and made the latter aware of Atwal’s past. “I don’t know if Bell was informed by his staff about it or not. I don’t want to quibble with my old colleague on it. I did not intervene in the matter as it would not have been appropriate as I could be having a bias about him,” he said.
