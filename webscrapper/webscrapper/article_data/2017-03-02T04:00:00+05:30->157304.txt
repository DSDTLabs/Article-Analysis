Surat: After six years of agony, the bottle-neck on National Highway (NH)-8 between Bharuch and Ankelshwar will be removed from March 7, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurates the new bridge built over Narmada river. The cable-stayed bridge would ease the traffic flow on Golden Corridor. Preparations are on in full swing for the function. However, official programme is yet to be disclosed.  Bharuch collector Sandipkumar Sagale said, “The new bridge will reduce issues of traffic on NH-8.”  As the number of vehicles on NH-8 has increased manifolds, the old bridge has become almost non-functional. The need for a new bridge was first felt in 2008. However, the issue was not taken up seriously by state and central governments. Only after Bharuch Citizen Council and a number of other social organization took up the cause the bridge was sanctioned in 2011. The work was assigned to National Construction Company, however, it failed to execute the project. So, Larsen & Toubro was awarded the work in 2013.  The new bridge joins two flyovers at Jadeswar Chowkdy and the Mandva Flyover, where the work is still going on.  Lack of this bridge had resulted in multiple problems for commuters due to frequent traffic jams on the old bridge and Golden Bridge.  Kamlesh Udani of Bharuch Citizens Council said, “The new bridge will be a boon for people of Anklewar and Bharuch. It will make commuting easier for thousands of people.”
