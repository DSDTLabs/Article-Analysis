NEW DELHI: Former PM   said tall promises had been made in the   but ground realities were different. He raised doubts on whether the   government had the money to back its  .

 Singh told a meeting of opposition parties that government could not achieve the growth it had projected in the budget. He said to double the income of farmers, as promised, agri growth will have to touch 12% which was not possible. He also slammed the Centre for not controlling fiscal deficit.
 
 Singh said the Budget’s objective painted a bright picture but did not appear to be supported by the reality of fiscal arithmetic. He seemed to be referring to cost-intensive budgetary announcements like the health scheme. 
 
 According to reports, when asked if the Budget brought reforms, he said the word reform had been “used and
 abused too many times”.
