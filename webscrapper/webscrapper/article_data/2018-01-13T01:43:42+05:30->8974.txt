GURGAON: Around 300 people will be   under   Apprenticeship   in Gurgaon and given wages fixed by government for semi-skilled force.

 According to norms, each department is required to register online about number of   they can train. After that, vacancies will be put up on departments’ portals or in other mediums. Interested candidates can apply without any documents and will be selected by officials concerned.
 
 “We’ll train them and also give them work in different fields. For instance, someone could be trained as a computer operator,” said Naresh Narnal, additional labour commissioner of Gurgaon and Faridabad.
 
 Narnal said each department had to train at least 10 per cent of their total work strength. The Gurgaon municipal corporation, which has around 2,200 employees, will have to train at least 220 people under the national scheme.
 
 The Apprentice Act, 1960, provisions that any establishment with more than 40 people has to employ apprentices equal to at least 10 per cent of their total strength. Even private establishments are liable for training apprentices, Narnalk added. T
