JAMMU: At least 16 Amarnath pilgrims were killed and over 30 sustained injuries after the bus they were travelling in skidded off the   national highway and plunged into a gorge in Jammu and Kashmir’s Ramban district on Sunday. The tragedy struck days after eight Amarnath yatris were killed and dozens wounded after terrorists opened fire on their bus in   district.

 Officials said the bus was heading towards Srinagar when its rear tyre burst and the driver lost control of the vehicle. It plunged into a nearly 200-foot-deep gorge of Nachlana Nullah near an Army camp in   area in Ramban. “A state road transport corporation bus bearing registration number JK02Y0594 ferrying Amarnath pilgrims rolled down into a gorge near Nachlana area of Ramsoo about 2.15pm,” a police officer said.
