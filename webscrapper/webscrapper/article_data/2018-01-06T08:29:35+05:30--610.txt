HYDERABAD: A large number of motorists are evading payment of second vehicle tax causing the state exchequer a loss to the tune of crores of rupees.

 This evasion of tax by motorists was revealed when the Telangana   started using the ‘integrated people information hub software’. This software cross-checks the names of vehicle owner, father’s name, date of birth, residential address,   and  , to search if any other vehicle is existing in one of these names or numbers.
 
 Since the software has been installed, transport officials were shocked to know that hundreds of applicants, who had declared it as their first vehicle, were found to be already owning a vehicle in their name.
 
 “We made them cough up 14 per cent tax that is applicable in the case of second vehicle ownership. We are also taking legal opinion on further action to be taken against those trying to evade second vehicle tax. It is the duty of   after making a correct declaration. Based on the legal opinion, a decision will be taken on what cases can be filed against those giving wrong declaration,” joint transport commissioner C Ramesh told TOI.
 
 The software was installed with effect on November 13, 2017. “Between November 11 and December 31, 2017, as many as 11,993 second vehicles were registered and a large number of them had not declared it as the second vehicle. It is only after the officials presented proof and told that cases would be booked that the owners relented and coughed up the tax,” said a senior official.
 
 The registration of 11,993 second vehicles helped the department earn a revenue of Rs 5.97 crore compared to only 6,248 vehicles in 2016 giving Rs 3.35 crore revenue to the transport department.
 
 C Ramesh said that though   gives the status of vehicle ownership of an individual, seeding was done a couple of years ago and registration of lakhs of vehicles was done in the few decades without Aadhaar as such people try to dodge the officials to evade tax.
