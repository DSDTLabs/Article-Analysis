LUCKNOW: Rebel Congress MLC from Rae Bareli   is all set to join BJP in presence of party chief Amit Shah, CM   and other senior UP ministers on Saturday. A long-time associate of Sonia Gandhi, Singh says winning elections will no longer be easy for Congress at its hustings.

 Singh quit Congress on April 10. Congress is being run as a private limited company, Singh alleged on Thursday. “There is a difference between Congress and BJP. While Congress functions like a private limited company, decisions are taken on the basis of common opinions in BJP.”
 
 
 Singh said he did his best for Congress but was not given his due. “While Narendra Modi’s MLC candidate from Varanasi lost, Sonia Gandhi’s candidate from Rae Bareli won. I kept Congress flag high even when the party was losing its base elsewhere,” he said.
 
 Criticising Sonia’s representative,  , in Rae Bareli, he said: “I regret that there was higher place for managers than Panchvati brothers (he and his five brothers live in a house called Panchvati). The party believed in these managers instead of trusting loyal workers. The high command went by the ground report sent by these managers to write us off. This has pained me.”
 
 
 
 
 He said when he asked for a party ticket for his brother from Harchandpur in 2017, he was made to sign on his resignation from the   in return. “I was told that if Congress-SP alliance came to power, the resignation would be accepted. The entire conversation was video recorded. I found it humiliating," he said.
