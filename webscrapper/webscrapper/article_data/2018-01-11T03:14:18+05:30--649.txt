NEW DELHI: Writer and rationalist M M Kalburgi’s widow told the   on Wednesday that emerging evidence made it essential that a composite probe be initiated into her husband’s murder along with the killings of scholars Govindrao Pansare and Narendra Achyut Dabholkar.

 In her petition, Umadevi Kalburgi said a   minister had recently said that cartridges recovered at the three murder sites appeared identical. She feared that these could be the handiwork of the same network or that the miscreants were linked by a common thread.
