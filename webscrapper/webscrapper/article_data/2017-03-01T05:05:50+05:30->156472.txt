Navi Mumbai:   is in talks with Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research ( ), a constituent laboratory of Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), for blasting and cutting of   hill to develop the Navi Mumbai International  .

 CIMFR, an autonomous government body and India’s largest research and development organization, is based in Dhanbad, Jharkhand. 
 
 A team from Cidco recently visited Kolkata to hold talks with officials of the premier institute. This is being described as a rare kind of operation of both hill-cutting and land-filling, and involves discharge of a whopping 35 million cubic meter of debris from the around 3-km long Ulwe hill.
 
 After cutting down Ulwe hill to eight metres, the airport base, where the two runways, terminal building, hangar and air traffic control tower, besides other infra works, will be developed.
 
 Talks are in the final stages and CIMFR will submit the cost of blasting operations for Cidco to take a call. The institute has been associated with premier infra projects such as the Koyna dam, nuclear power plants and also road infra works in high-altitude hilly areas in Jammu and Kashmir, an official from Cidco said.
 
 Sources said issues discussed with CIMFR by Cidco’s engineering department have been regarding the nature of rocky substance and designing of the blasting. It is largely sedimentary and basalt rock and would require different types of blasting at various places.
 
 Some of the key aspects to be addressed at present are the distance of drilling on the hill for blasting and power of explosives to be used, so that the noise emitted and dispersion of debris are minimum. 
 
 There are 10 villages in the core area with 3,500 families that need to be shifted at the earliest for full-scale unhindered work to start.
