Rajkot: Two couples died in separate incidents of suicide and accidental death in Jetpur and Rajkot on Sunday. 

 Chhaya Chauhan (18), a resident of Mayurnagar area in Rajkot, and her paramour Sagar Baraiya (20), a resident of Chunarawad, drowned in Aji Dam. Though primary investigation suggests it was an accident, police do not rule out the possibility of suicide.
 
 "Both Chhaya and Sagar were in love and were slated to get married in near future with the consent of their respective families. Though their families say it was an accident, we find it fishy as the couple drove to Aji Dam on a bike and then jumped into it. The probe is on," said an investigating official.
 
 In Jetpur, Ramiz Lakad (20) and his girlfriend Bhavna Vavadia (16) hanged themselves to death from the ceiling fan of Lakad’s house near Navagadh Idgah Dargah in Jetpur on Saturday night. Their bodies were found on Sunday morning.
 
 “When Bhavna’s father Raju Vavadia did not find her in her room, he started searching for her. As he knew about his daughter’s affair with Ramiz, he went to Ramiz’s house where he found her body hanging along with Ramiz’s body,” said an official from Jetpur police station.
