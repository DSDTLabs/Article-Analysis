PUNE: Two persons of a six-member inter-state gang were arrested on Thursday for their involvement in robbing a private   firm’s Rs31 lakh on Ganeshkhind Road in Shivajinagar in the early hours of August 24 posing as policemen.

 Acting on a tip-off, a crime branch unit-I team nabbed the duo, Suraj Rathod (34) of Diu and Kamalesh Dhodi (26) of Gujarat, at Chandani Chowk. Rs21 lakh, two air-pistols and a sports utility vehicle worth Rs31 lakh collectively were recovered from them. Their accomplices are on the run.
 
 The gang-of-six had intercepted the courier firm’s SUV at Shivajinagar posing as policemen in the early hours of August 24 after switching on the red beacon on their vehicle. They abducted the courier firm’s three employees with Rs31 lakh and later dumped them at Talegaon Dabhade on Pune-Mumbai highway. A   was registered with the Chatushrungi police.
 
 The police did not have any clues about the gang. The crime   collected CCTV footage from the spot and alerted informers. “Sonune got the information about Rathod and his accomplices,” said Pankaj Dahane, deputy commissioner of police (crime).
 
 He said the police learnt that Rathod and his accomplices were travelling towards Satara on Thursday. Inspector Bhosale-Patil and his team laid a trap at Chandani Chowk and nabbed Rathod and Dhodi with Rs21 lakh and the SUV. “The suspects have cases of dacoities and robberies in Diu, Daman, Gujrat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Delhi,” Dahane said.
