PANAJI: As many as 72 adults who were declared mentally fit by the doctors at Institute of Psychiatry & Human Behavior ( ) over a year ago, continue to reside at provedoria-operated homes. The government, had arranged for them to be sent there since their families had refused to take them back.

 Provedoria minister Francis D’Souza said they have no option but to keep these adults (those transferred from IPHB) as their families are not willing to accept them back.
 
 D’Souza said that had their families accepted their responsibilities, the rooms occupied by these adults could instead have been thrown open to other needy people
 
 “It is sad that their family members don’t want to have them back,” D’Souza said adding though provedoria homes don’t have certain facilities, the director of provedoria has been ensuring that these inmates are well cared for.
