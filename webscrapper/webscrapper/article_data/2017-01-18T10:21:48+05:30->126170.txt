JAIPUR: Ethiopian president Dr Mulatu Teshome praised the Jaipur-based   for the handicapped   (BMVSS), the makers of the   for holding two camps in   and  

 At a ceremony in Harar town in the eastern region of Ethiopia, Dr Teshome said that the effort of the BMVSS that equipped 700 persons with the Jaipur Foot was laudable. He said it was a great humanitarian work that helped the Ethiopian handicapped not only gain mobility but also dignity.
 
 Some patients fitted with the Jaipur Foot gave a demonstration by walking, jumping and squatting. They showed how they were able to walk like normal people and were happy that after gaining mobility they would be able to work.
 
 The special guest, Indiaâ€™s ambassador to Ethiopia, Anurag Shrivastav, said that the Jaipur Foot camp will help in strengthening the bond between India and Ethiopia. He hoped that similar camps will be held in other parts of the country.
 
 Founder and the chief patron of the BMVSS D R Mehta said that their organisation would be willing to set up a permanent centre in Ethiopia and train its technical persons there to enable them start a Jaipur Foot centre in the country like it has done in Afghanistan, Mauritus and other countries. 
 
 He revealed that at the two camps organised in Ethiopia, the 12-member technical team of the BMVSS provided limbs free of cost.
