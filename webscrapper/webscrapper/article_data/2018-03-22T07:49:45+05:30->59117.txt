AHMEDABAD: This   is worth its salt for  . For a   appears on television to endorse a  , which manufactures  , and makes a statement that all   available in market are made in chemical factories.

 Upon an exception being taken to “disparaging” and “denigrating” remarks against other brands in a generalized manner by a trust of various manufacturers of white coloured salt, a city civil court has restrained Puro Wellness Pvt Ltd from broadcasting on television and social media its advertisement featuring actor Anil Kapoor . Additional district judge A A Nanavati has ordered an ex-parte interim injunction on the advertisements. Further hearing on the issue has been posted on March 28.
 
 Indian Salt Manufacturers’ Association (ISMA), which has members like TATA and Nirma, filed a suit in the court earlier this month and took exception to Puro salt’s advertisement featuring the filmstar. The objection was raised on the ground that the advertisement conveys the message that white salt is manufactured in chemical factories and is bleached by bleaching agents. ISMA’s advocate Jatin Trivedi also argued that the advertisement is false and baseless and creates a wrong impression in the minds of consumers who will feel that white salt is not good for health.
 
 It was also contended on part of ISMA that Puro Wellness may claim that its pink salt is good for health, but it cannot assert through advertisement that white salt available in the market is bad and unhealthy. ISMA submitted, “The law established in terms of disparaging and comparative advertisements in India by various judicial pronouncements clearly show that a trader can self-puff or say that its product is good but cannot further say that the product of rivals is bad or unhealthy”.
