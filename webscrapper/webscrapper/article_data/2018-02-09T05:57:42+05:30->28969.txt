It's celebration time for the cast and crew of Ajun Bijlani and   starrer   as the daily completed 100 episodes. The cast and crew celebrated the feat in Manali where they are shooting for latest sequence. 

 Arjun shared the news on Twitter. He even thanked fans for their love and support. 
 
 
  
 Arjun and Alisha are extremely excited to shoot in the picturesque valley of Manali and can be seen enjoying the view in the chilly weather. The cast and crew are in Manali for the second time after they started shooting in August-September last year in Manali. 
 
 Speaking on the experience in Manali Arjun says,"It is great to be back in Manali. So many memories attached to the valley. This is my third trip as earlier I came for a vacation and twice on work. Last time when I was here I visited the famous and auspicious Hidimba temple and I prayed there for the success of the show. And now when our show is doing well I will be going there again and will thank goddess for the success of the show." 
 
 The weather in Manali is extremely cold now and Arjun is very happy for that, "In Mumbai weather is always humid and we hardly experience winter, am so happy that this time in Manali I am enjoying the snow and it is a visual treat for sure. I am carrying a lot of warm clothes, mufflers and jackets so I can wear layers of clothes." 
 
 Arjun is also looking forward to eat momos and hot noodles. He adds,"You get some great Momos here as the temperature is very cold and this food can make us warm. If I get some time off I might go for a ropeway ride." 
 
 Arjun is missing his son   a lot in this trip as he adds,"He is only three and I don't want him to fall sick because the temperature is very low here. But technology always helps in this situation as I am going to do video chats with him."
