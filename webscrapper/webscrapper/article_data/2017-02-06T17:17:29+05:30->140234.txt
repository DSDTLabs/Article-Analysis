 Roshan and   Khan are setting new standards as far as exes being friendly is concerned. This time, the former IT couple of Bollywood was seen spending a lazy afternoon on Sunday with   and   Khanna at a suburban hotel along with Gayatri and Vicky Oberoi. They even attended a special screening of Akshay’s upcoming film, 'Jolly LLB 2' later in the evening. 

 Since the last couple of months, Hrithik and Sussanne have been looking comfortable in each other’s presence. Clearly, gone are the days of being awkward in the presence of the ex. Throughout 2016 and even last month, the former couple was often spotted together. A few months ago, they were at a birthday party with their sons Hrehaan and Hridaan. 
 
 That’s not all; they were spotted with their kids and Sussane’s family in Dubai, spending quality time, dining and hanging out on the beach. A couple of weeks later, Sussanne was seen at Hrithik’s bachelor pad, partying with their common friends and playing host of sorts at Kaabil’s special screenings. She even posted pictures on her social media account. And mind it, she still goes with   (Sussane Khan Roshan) as her name on the page. 
 Recently, in an interview to BT, Hrithik had even spoken about being friends with his former wife of 13 years. 
 
 Aww! Now, that’s BFFs of the sort that we rarely find.
