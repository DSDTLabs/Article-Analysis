PANAJI:   Wagh, wife of former deputy speaker  , has sought the withdrawal of an order transferring her to Mumbai so she can take care of her ailing husband. While Vishnu has been bedridden for over a year and a half following a cardiac arrest, Aruna said that she is suffering from thyroid cancer. 

 “Service rules mandate that an employee cannot be transferred if they are suffering from severe diseases like cancer, or if the disease is suffered by their dependent,” Aruna, an education officer at the Union labour ministry’s   office, told TOI. 
 
 “Despite knowing full well that Vishnu’s condition is sensitive and that he needs me beside him at all times, an order was issued.” tnn
