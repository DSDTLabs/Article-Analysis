But no specific dates have been announced. There are 52 hospitals (10-beds) which have only one doctor. Often, when patients come in the night, it is the cook, attender or nurse who is giving medicine.This is the state of affairs. There is no doctor to even refer them to another hospi tal,“ said Dr  , general secretary , Kerala State Government Ayurveda Doctors Association.
 
 He said that in 157 panchayats, there are no ayurveda hospitals.
 
 “But the government says only four panchayats does not have them. This is because government is counting hospitals under the  . But any day the project can come to an end. We need at least 1,000 new doctors in our hospitals,“ he said.
