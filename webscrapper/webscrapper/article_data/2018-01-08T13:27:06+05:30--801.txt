LUCKNOW: Social media saw a war of quips between UP chief minister Aditya Nath   and his   counterpart   on Sunday as both took to micro-blogging site Twitter to slam each other’s model of governance.

 While addressing a Parivartan Rally in Bengaluru on Sunday, it was Yogi who first took a pot shot against his counterpart, raking up the issue of beef ban in the state by saying, “If Siddaramaiah is a Hindu, then let him ban cow slaughter and beef in the state.”
 
 Siddaramaiah replied instantly through his official Twitter handle @Sidaramaiah: “I welcome UP CM Shri @myogiadityanath to our state. There is a lot you can learn form us Sir. When you are here please visit a Indira Canteen & a ration shop. It will help you address the starvation deaths sometimes reported from your state” the   strongman wrote.
 
  
  
 
 Yogi was quick to respond: “Thank you for the welcome @siddaramaih ji. I heard number of farmers committing suicide in Karnataka was highest in your regime, not to mention the number deaths and transfer of honest officers As UP CM I am working to undo the misery and lawlessness unleashed by your allies,” said his tweet from handle @myogiadityanath.
