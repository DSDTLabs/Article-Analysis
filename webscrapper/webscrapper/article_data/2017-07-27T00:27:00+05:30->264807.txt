Chandigarh: A local court on Tuesday sentenced a UT electricity department clerk to two-year jail term for accepting a   of Rs 2,000.

 The court also imposed a fine of Rs 4,000 on Jaswant Singh who was held guilty on Monday of accepting a bribe from a contractor. The matter dates back to February 2012, when the anti-corruption branch (ACB) had arrested Jaswant Singh under Sections 7 (public servantâ€™s taking gratification) and 13 (criminal misconduct by a public servant) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
 
 A contractor engaged at Chandigarh Judicial Complex in Sector 43, had gone to the anti-corruption branch with a complaint that Jaswant had demanded a bribe from him. The contractor had installed a temporary electrical connection for the work awarded to him. A bill for inflated charges brought him to the electricity wing, where Jaswant Singh demanded Rs 5,000 initially and then Rs 2,000 as graft for correcting his electricity bill. The contractor went to the ACB, which laid a trap and caught the clerk accepting bribe.
 
 After the prosecution prayed for maximum punishment, the court awarded the clerk rigorous imprisonment for two years.
