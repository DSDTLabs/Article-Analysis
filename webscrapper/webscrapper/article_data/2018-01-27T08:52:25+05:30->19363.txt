KOLKATA: Rajasthan's inexperience showed in the end as they went down to Delhi in the final of the   under the lights at the   on Friday. The Central Zone champions seemed to have learnt no lessons from Thursday's failed chase against Punjab and once again botched up a simple chase of 154 runs and lost to Delhi by 41 runs.

 Delhi, who lost the Ranji Trophy final to Vidarbha earlier in the season, made sure they didn't let the T20 crown slip. Superb bowling by their skipper  , backed up by efficient fielding, helped Delhi cap their maiden appearance in the final with the title.
 
 As long as young Aditya Garhwal was there in the middle, Rajasthan were in the game. He made 53 off 49 balls before holing out in the deep off Lalit Yadav in the 12th over.
 
 With no other Rajasthan player showing any inclination to stretch the game, getting out in a variety of ways, including hit-wicket, the writing was on the wall long before the match actually ended on the first ball of the final over.
 
 Earlier, electing to bat first, Delhi openers   and Rishabh Pant got off to a solid start. Gambhir played a couple of handsome drives and flicks before being clean bowled by leg spinner   (2/31) in the 5th over. Pant got a top edge while trying to pull a short one from   (2/23) to leave Delhi at 41/2 in 5.1 overs.   and   addded a vital 48 runs for the third wicket. It was Rahul Chahar who broke the partnership by luring Shorey out of the crease and having him stumped.
 
 Chand, playing his second match in the tournament, played confidently, making a polished 53 off 49 as Delhi finished with 153/6 on the board.
 
 
 Delhi 153/6 (U Chand 53, G Gambhir 27; Khaleel 2/23, Chahar 2/31) beat Rajasthan 112 in 19.1 overs (A Garhwal 52; Sangwan 2/14, Khejroliya 2/24) by 41 runs.
