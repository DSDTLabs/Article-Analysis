Visakhapatnam: Friday morning turned out to be special for K Sumit with assistant commissioner of police (traffic) K Prabhakar himself rewarding him for abiding by traffic regulations at Asilmetta Junction. 

 However, he was not the only one. Hundreds of motorists like him were presented with gifts from The Times of India at Gurudwara and Asilmetta junctions. "You must share the importance of following traffic norms with your family and friends,” the ACP told everyone.
 
 “This is a great initiative by The Times of India. All motorists who genuinely follow road rules are getting appreciated. This will encourage them and ensure that more and more motorists follow traffic rules and regulations,” said Adusumilli Suresh, a businessman from Waltair Uplands who also received a gift for wearing seat belt while driving.
 
 Motorists who carried copies of The Times of India as well as adhered to the traffic regulations were also rewarded with gifts.
 
 “The attitude of motorists have changed to a certain extent after the campaign by The Times Of India began. Receiving a gift from TOI doubles my responsibility. My return gift would be to promote traffic rules and make Vizag a safe place. The awareness programme has definitely inspired several motorists,” said Surendra Kumar M. 
 
 Organised by The Times of India, ‘Win with the Times’ campaign is supported by the city traffic police and Vizag Road Transport Authority departments and would be held at various junctions in the city till May 26 from Monday to Friday, between 8.30 am-10 am. 
 
 On Monday (May 15), the campaign will be held at Kurmanapalem Junction and Urvashi Junction.
