PANAJI: State-run   ( ) reported losses amounting to one and a half lakh rupees as a result of damages stemming from Monday’s violent protests by mining dependants.

 A total of eight KTCL buses were damaged by protesters. The front and rearview mirrors of these vehicles were broken by agitators in the counterstrike as they tried to retaliate the lathi-charge inflicted by the police. “The damages amount to around Rs 1.5 lakh,” KTCL sources said on Tuesday.
 
 Panaji remained paralysed for close to five hours on Monday as over 3,000 mining dependants blocked both Mandovi bridges. When superintendent of police   tried to reason with them, they pushed the police officer, following which, the Maharashtra police and Indian Reserve Battalion resorted to lathi-charge to tackle the agitating protesters.
 
 The mob took refuge inside the   building. While many hid in various nooks and corners of the building, some agitators pelted stones at government vehicles. One fire tender and a police van were damaged. “Two KSRTC and two MSRTC buses were also damaged, besides eight of our buses,” a KTCL official said.
 
 The Panaji regional transport office’s (RTO) enforcement wing conducted an enquiry into the damages caused by the mob at the KTCL bus terminus. “Besides buses, no other property at the bus stand was damaged. None of the shop owners on the premises have reported any losses either,” an RTO official told TOI.
 
 Representatives from KTCL filed a complaint about the damage on Tuesday with the Panaji police, following which a PSI conducted an inspection and did the panchnama.
 
 “We have sent the vehicle to the central workshop in   for repairs. Meanwhile, the KSRTC and MSRTC buses have also sent their buses to their respective depots in Karnataka and Maharashtra for repairs,” he said.
