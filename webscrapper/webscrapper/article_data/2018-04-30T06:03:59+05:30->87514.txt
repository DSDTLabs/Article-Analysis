KOLKATA: A nine-member special investigation team (SIT) headed by a deputy SP was formed on Sunday to investigate the carcass meat supply racket. The state Enforcement Branch has also started its own probe. The four-day-long investigation has thrown up a a long chain of suspects and a number of vexing questions. Police said Bishu, the owner of the cold storage inside the ice factory at   — who allegedly leased it from another person — holds the key to identifying the places where the carcass meat was sent in the past five years.

 
  
  
 
 “We are engaging several teams in greater Kolkata and outside the state,” said SP (Diamond Harbour division)  . “Raids are being conducted to nab others involved in the incident. We have also alerted all our officers throughout the district to be alert and nab those selling illegal meat or transporting them,” Rao said.
 
 Police suspect there could be five other major players, besides the 10 arrested, who acted as linkmen for this group. “Unless we establish the chain, it will be difficult to find the extent of this organized racket,” an officer said.
 
 Police said the accused maintained diaries to keep accounts. “But these were missing from the Rajabazar storage. Similarly, the khadi facility where carcass meat was cut up also was abandoned after carefully removing evidence. This shows that more brains were behind the racket,” claimed sources.
 
 State consumer affairs minister Sadhan Pande said he will submit a detailed report on this matter to chief minister  .
 
 The topic has created so much furore that residents of Purple Town area on Sunday stopped a man carrying seven bags of meat — suspecting it to be carcass or meat soaked in formalin — and handed him over to police. He was let go when the meat was found to be freshly cut chicken.
