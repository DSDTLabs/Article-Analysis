CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh administration is going to implement ‘The   Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institution Bill, 2016’ in Chandigarh as the proposal sent by the administration to Central government with department of school education and literacy of ministry of human resource and development has been approved. This was informed by the Chandigarh administration in Punjab and   high court on Monday during the resumed hearing of the case. 

 If all goes well, this could also be a shocker for the city-based unaided private schools who take the privilege of having no rules to regulate the fee structure. Once adopted, it will set a cap of 8% on   and will act strict against commercialisation in private schools.
 
 It was also informed to high court that the draft policy has been sent to the publication department for publising the same. It was also added that this policy would be implemented with minor changes.
 
 PIL was filed in high court alleging that many schools have been indulged in profiteering and flouting norms and regulations framed by CBSE. It was alleged that despite high court directions, UT administration has not yet framed any policy to regulate fee structure and this is causing so much inconvenience and harassment to parents every year.
 
 With the implementation of this act, a committee whic has already been formed, will keep a watch over schools, regularise unjustified fee hikes by them or charge fine for violation and ask respective boards to cancel affiliation of defaulter schools.
