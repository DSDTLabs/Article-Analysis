TRICHY: The   ( ) in Trichy, which has eight districts under its jurisdiction, on Thursday expressed its inability to immediately act on the complaints of cheating by a finance company, based in Aaduthurai in Thanjavur district, citing lack of manpower. 

 The officials of EOW in Trichy received a couple of complaints from Durairaj and Manoharan from Thanjavur district on Thursday. They had travelled all the way from Aaduthurai near Kumbakonam to Trichy to lodge their complaint against   in Aaduthurai for cheating them of Rs 50,000 each on the promise of returning the amount with 22% interest after three years. 
 
 Durairaj had deposited Rs 50,000 in 2014 and waited for it to mature in August 2017. To his shock, the finance company closed in March this year leaving all its 5,000 plus depositors in the lurch. Manoharan also had the same bitter experience with Chithra Finance. 
 
 The reply from the EOW officials made their predicament even more difficult on whether they could get back their money from the finance company. 
 
 A senior EOW official told the complainants that the investigation would take a long time because it involved a lot of enquiry in Aaduthurai and surrounding areas. “We have to depute a team to visit the areas in Thanjavur to get information on the case and the accused. 
 
 With the current strength of the team, it will take a long time to investigate completely,” said deputy superintendent of police (DSP) K Arul 
 
 A case was registered at the district crime branch (DCB) in Thanjavur in April this year under sections 406, 420 of IPC read with 5 of   protection of interest and deposits (TANPID) Act. Recently, the case was transferred to EOW-Trichy as it involved cheating in crores.
 
 The EOW wing in Trichy comprises a DSP, inspector, two sub-inspectors, two special sub-inspectors and three constables. The unit handles Trichy city, Trichy rural, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Pudukkottai Thanjavur, Tiruvaur and Nagappattinam.
