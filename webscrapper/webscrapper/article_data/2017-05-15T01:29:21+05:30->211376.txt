THANE: With the cash collection at the toll post at   exceeding Rs 500 crore in a span of 15 years, the operator— Ideal Road Builders (IRB)—   shop on Saturday midnight. So, from now on   will be able to enjoy a toll-free ride along this stretch on the Mumbai-Nashik highway.

 The Kharegaon toll post, which was under the jurisdiction of the   (NHAI), was closed as per the 2002 notification which stated that May 13, 2017, would be the last day for recovering toll from motorists.
 
 Citizen activist  , who has been fighting with the state government to bring in transparency in the toll policy, said that the cartel involving the policy makers in Mantralaya, contractor and politicians have crafted a toll policy which is favourably tilted in favour of the toll contractor.
 
 The IRB had developed this once-narrow stretch into a four-lane highway and it is estimated that work of widening the road and maintenance had cost the contractor Rs 180. 83 crore then. The firm has declared that it has collected Rs 500 crore from this toll post. “We just hope that now that the contract is over and the PWD would take care of the road and maintain it so that motorists are ensured a hassle-free drive, especially during the rainy season,” said Ghanekar.
 
 Meanwhile, motorists who regularly take this route were happy about the move. They said that this will lead to no traffic congestion in the are which used to be caused due to the toll collection.
