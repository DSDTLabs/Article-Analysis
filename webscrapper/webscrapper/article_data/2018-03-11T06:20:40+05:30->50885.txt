LUCKNOW: It may be a byelection, but UP chief minister   led from the front, addressing as many as 21public meetings in 15 days.

 While   insiders rule outthat Yogi’s campaign was “overdone”, they say it was done to “do away with even the remotest possibility of not winning the bypolls.”
 
 
 It, rather, had other nuances to it. The party always wanted to devise the campaign in a manner that it should be a challenge for state leaders and not of only of the candidates for the bypolls. No election is small for the party, say party leaders.
 
 Not only the chief minister, campaigning for the present bypolls had state party president   and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya along with other state leaders also interact with the electorate. “Election certainly is an opportunity to connect with voters in a more one-to-one manner,” said party spokesperson Chandramohan.
 
 Talking of chief minister’s public meetings, the party said it is the working style of the CM that he, himself, goes for campaigning in all elections. And when it comes to   which is the constituency nurtured by him in his five terms as MP, the campaigning became a cause even dear to the CM. “People of Gorakhpur are never tired of seeing and listening to   and he never disappoints the people of Gorakhpur,” said a party leader.
 
 On the eve of the bypolls in Gorakhpur and  , party leaders said the another focus of the campaign strategy this time was to not let voting percentage fall. “It is mostly seen that bypollhas a low voting percentage and party does not want this,” said spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi.
