NOIDA: Builders here are hopeful of a spurt in sales in the real estate sector while homebuyers are also upbeat about the BJP victory boding well for them.

 The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai) said the   signified a big push for the sector in the state as the buyers’ faith in the industry would be reinstated. The buyers said that against the backdrop of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) notified in November 2016 and the creation of the real estate regulatory authority still pending, the new government should ensure that UP adopts the original version announced by the Centre.
 
 The bone contention between the Centre’s and UP’s RERA versions is the delay penalty. Amit Modi, vice-president, Credai Western UP, told TOI, “We expect the political shift in the state government to have a positive impact on the real estate market. Buyers will now take more interest in the market. We are expecting a spurt in sales. The sector is definitely going to move out of stagnation.” Representatives of homebuyers in Noida and Greater Noida had met BJP leaders prior to the UP election to garner support for a pro-buyer RERA. With the regulatory body yet to become functional in UP, the buyers hoped that RERA in UP would be the same as the Centre’s version, making it watertight against builders’ violations. Abhishek Kumar, president, Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association (Nefowa) said, “We demand RERA be implemented in a way that ensures the interests of buyers are protected. We had met home minister Rajnath Singh before the elections and he assured us that a just version of RERA would be implemented in the state. ”
