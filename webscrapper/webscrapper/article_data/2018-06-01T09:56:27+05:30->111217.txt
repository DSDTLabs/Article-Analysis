 The order, issued by DEO B S  , stated that sharing or circulating information related to departmental policies on social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp was a violation of service rules.
 
 "Teachers and other employees of department have been found sharing information regarding department, officials, meetings, etc. on social media. This is a violation under Information Technology Act, 2000 as well as of service rules," the order said.

 "It has been found that some teachers have made use of derogatory language, annoying comments against the state government and government officials, which is objectionable and also against the duties. Therefore, it has been decided that disciplinary action would be taken against such teachers/ employees indulging in such activities," the order copy stated.
