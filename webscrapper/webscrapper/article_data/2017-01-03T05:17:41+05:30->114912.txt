NAVI MUMBAI: Durga Vahini, the women's wing of the Vishva Hindu Parishad, stopped tourists on their way to Raigad Fort on New Year's Eve and checked their vehicles for liquor. The pretext of the right wing women, who were carrying sticks, was that tourists go to the fort to get drunk, thereby damaging “the sanctity of the place“.

 Durga Vahini activist Dipali Date said, “Two years ago, during a visit to Malvan Fort, I found liquor bottles there.There and then I thought we should protect the sanctity of Shivaji Maharaj's Raigad Fort. So, women groups trained by me took up this task. Three groups, each with eight members, keep vigil on tourists at Pachad village, the ropeway parking area and atop the fort. This year, not a single person was noticed drunk or consuming liquor inside the fort.“
 
 Date said the women inform the police (Mahad taluka) before conducting a check.“The Mahad police have restrained us from beating up people, but I once told them we will use Kolhapur chappals against drunks littering the fort, if need be.
 
 Raigad police's PRO   said, “They are doing social service and may be helping the police. I will check with Mahad taluka police about whether formal permission is granted.“
 
 TIMES VIEW:
 
 Drinking at forts is illegal, but preventing that is the duty of the police, not vigilante groups, more so organisations spouting moral outrage. Thus Raigad police's tacit approval of the VHP's women's wing's activities is worrisome. In general, enforcement of law and order is best kept outside the purview of private organisations.
