 is certainly a quirky superhero — he delivers the quirkiest lines even when he’s thrashing his enemies. The first film in the franchise was a hit and now, Fox Star Studios hopes to make its sequel, '
 ', a bigger success. 

 
  
 
 The English version has already created a buzz around the globe, and the West-Meets-East collaboration, which will hit theatres on May 18, promises to pack a bigger punch. To begin with, the studio has roped in   to dub for the title character in the movie’s Hindi version. They wanted a star who would resonate with Deadpool’s traits and found a perfect match in Ranveer’s witty and edgy personality.
 
 The desi version has got an A-certificate, as the makers have retained the irreverent tone of the English film, which has   mouthing cuss words, to heighten the impact of humour and the style of storytelling 'Deadpool' is known for. The studio is optimistic that the Hindi trailer, which releases today, will become popular, as Ranveer has added his own masala to the character.
 
 About choosing the actor for the film, Vijay Singh, CEO, Fox Star Studios, says, “Like Deadpool, Ranveer, too, is known for his smart, witty and irreverent humour. He’s a daring and powerhouse actor and we absolutely relished having him on board for our biggest superhero film.”
