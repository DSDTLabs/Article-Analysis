NEW DELHI: In the aftermath of the Gaikwad episode,   is beefing up its mechanism to handle unruly passengers. The airline will soon start issuing written warnings to flyers whose behaviour threatens safety of flight, crew or co-passengers. If they still do not behave themselves,   will apply restrainers on flight and may hand them over to security agencies on arrival. 

 “We are taking some steps as per   ( ) guidelines. Our operations team is working on it and we will finalise it shortly,” AI chairman Ashwani Lohani said.
 
 Asenior official said: “We used to carry printed warning letters for unruly passengers on long flights. This practice was not followed on the shorter domestic flights. Now we are planning to have warning letters on all flights. There is a well established standard operating procedure for tackling unruly flyers. We are going to strengthen it and reiterate the same to our crew very soon.”
 
 In fact most of the ‘methods’ for reining in unruly passengers were used on long international flights as drinks are served on them and people may get high and act funny after that. But given the spike in cases of disruptive flyers on domestic flight also in recent years, AI will replicate its international model on flights within India too. The Maharaja recently started carrying restrainers on domestic flights also, while earlier they were kept only on international ones.
