MEERUT: Two years have passed since   (MCB) earmarked an area behind   for vendors to sell their goods by paying a monthly fee but they continue do business on the crowded  . The spot behind Nayyar Palace was earmarked in 2015 but it is now lying empty. MCB says it will shift the vendors after the elections.
 
  “That spot is out of the way for buyers.   Road is convenient for people to buy goods from us. The road where the new market was set up by MCB remains deserted. We tried to set up our shops at the spot behind Nayyar Palace but not many customers visited that place. So, we had to shift back. Apart from significant reduction in business at the new spot, we also had to pay monthly rent of up to Rs 1,000 to MCB," said Iqbal Ahmed, a fruit seller in Lal Kurti.
  
  Residents of Lal Kurti say if the vendors shift to the new spot, it would inconvenience them, but if the hawkers stay put the area becomes congested and dirty. “It is very convenient for us if the vegetable and fruit vendors are present here in this lane as we can shop while passing by. However, if the vendors continue to do business on Lal Kurti Road, hygiene issues are there as a lot of garbage is generated here as this is an unorganised market," said Kamal Raj, a resident of Lal Kurti.
  
  MCB, on its part, continues to blame everything on the elections. “Yes, we are aware that fruit and vegetable vendors have shifted back to Lal Kurti. Due to the assembly elections and the model code of conduct in force, we could do nothing about it. Earlier, we didn’t have adequate force with us to forcefully shift the vendors. We will take action after the elections," said M A Zafar, media officer of MCB.
