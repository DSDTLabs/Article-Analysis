Vadodara: Twenty students from 1978 batch of MSU’s fine arts faculty paid tribute to their teacher and renowned artist Jeram Patel by displaying their works at the faculty’s exhibition hall on Thursday. The event also marked the reunion of the batch at the faculty.

 “Some of us who were in contact with each other had decided to give tribute to Jeram sir and since most of us had not met in many years, we decided to organize the exhibition. We approached many students of our batch with the idea and got enthusiastic response,” said Malti Gaekwad, assistant professor of applied arts at MSU, who graduated in 1978.
 
 Anil Relia, who also did his majors in applied arts and runs a studio in Ahmedabad, had created a screen printing work on canvas especially for the exhibition. He told TOI: “I took inspiration from our classes with Jeram sir and made this art work.”
 
 Relia also read out an article written by veteran artist Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh about the early life of Patel and his working style. The batchmates of 1978 also talked about their learning experiences under Patel.
 
 “Jeram sir had challenged me to make a commercial design for a newspaper. He had told me it will be impossible for me to make it but I worked whole night and made it,” said Rajan Bhow who learnt under Patel.
 
 Gaekwad also said that Patel was a strict teacher but he was very generous. “He would often help his students financially to pay their fees,” she said.
 
 The artists displayed their ceramic works, acrylic on canvas, acrylic on paper, paper work on batik cloth, digital prints among others at the exhibition.
