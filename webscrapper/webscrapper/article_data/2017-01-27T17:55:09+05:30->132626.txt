PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has finalised 294 places in the city, where election   and public meetings can be held during upcoming civic elections.

 The list of places along with the rates of rent will be uploaded on the PMC’s website. Most of these places are amenity spaces. The option to conduct rallies in the chowks will be available subject to permission from traffic police and police stations of the respective areas. Apart from these designated places even private places can be hired for political events provided that all the necessary permissions have been obtained.
 
 “PMC has set up monitoring teams and has also formed flying squads. They will be stationed at all these places and will monitor the rallies and other programmes conducted by the leaders or parties. Video recording of these events will be done to check if any violation of code of conduct has taken place or not,” said Satish Kulkarni,   office head at the civic body.
 
 Kulkarni said that the administration will not allow rallies in the riverbed. The land belongs to irrigation department and all the formalities to conduct meetings there will have to be done by irrigation department. 
 
 As many as 10 municipal corporations, including Pune, will go the polls on February 21 and the results will be announced on February 23. Over 26.43 lakh voters have been registered for this election, which will elect 162 corporators.
