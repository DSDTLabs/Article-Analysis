Coimbatore: The forest department has captured as many as 14 monkeys from Pethikuttai and Sirumugai over the past two days after residents and farmers there complained that the animals had been raiding their farmlands, damaging banana plants, and also disturbing the public.

 According to officials, four monkeys had been roaming near the office of Sirumugai forest range officer and nearby residential areas. The forest department brought a cage from Mettupalayam, put in it fruits and snacks and placed it near the rangerâ€™s office to capture the four monkeys.
 
 At Pethikuttai, as many as 30 monkeys were found in a farmland belonging to one Chinnaiyan. As in the previous case, the forest department kept a cage with fruits and snacks in the farmland and captured 10 monkeys.
 
 The captured monkeys were later taken to the Kunukku Madavu river, 10km away from the farmland at Pethikuttai.
 
 E N Manoharan, Sirumugai forest ranger, said the department would capture all the monkeys roaming in the farmlands and residential areas of Pethikuttai and Sirumugai.
