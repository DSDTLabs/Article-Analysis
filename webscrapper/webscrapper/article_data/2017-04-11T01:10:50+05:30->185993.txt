Ghaziabad: The district administration on Monday directed departmental proceedings against a doctor in   on charges of prescribing medicines to be purchased from the retail market. The decision comes after an inspection of the hospital premises by a team of administration officials led by   and ADM (City) Preeti Jaiswal.

 The administration has also ordered withholding of one-day salary of 11 doctors who were found absent during duty hours on Monday.
 
 “One of the patients complained against a dermatologist who would prescribe medicines on a blank paper to be purchased from outside the hospital. Upon enquiry, the doctor said that certain medicines were unavailable at the dispensary. However, the health department has been recommended to initiate departmental action against the doctor. An inspection report will be sent to the chief medical superintendent,” Jaiswal told TOI.
 
 The CMS, Dr J K Tyagi, has also been asked to seek an explanation from the head nurse of the female ward regarding non-availability of drinking water inside the premises.
