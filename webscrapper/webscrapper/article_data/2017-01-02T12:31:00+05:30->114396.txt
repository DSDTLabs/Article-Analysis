Six-year-old   stole hearts on   with her   on a kid’s reality show. And now, the tiny talent is back to wowing viewers, this time, by playing a boy in the serial   which went on air recently. 

 “The story is about two warring families and how, for peace to prevail, the elder brother has to beget a male heir. He gets a daughter instead and dies at a later date. A plotting mother-in-law is also part of the scene. To save herself and her daughter, the wife lies to everyone that she has got a boy, thus he will now be the varasdhara (the inheritor),” explains Varsha Raghavendra, fiction head of the show. 
 
 And that’s how Chitrali was chosen for the boy’s role. “She is so talented and sharp for her age. On the kid’s talent reality show, she proved her range and now has a fan club due to it. Chitrali has been getting a lot of praise for her turnout on the show. She even cut her hair for it,” sums up Varsha, adding that saving the girl child is a strong message that the team aims to convey.
