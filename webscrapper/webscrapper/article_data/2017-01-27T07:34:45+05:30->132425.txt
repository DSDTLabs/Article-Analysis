HYDERABAD: Acting Chief Justice of the Hyderabad high court   Thursday said that it is a matter of great pride that for the first time in the history of this high court, it has three women judges on its rolls. This is the highest ever since this high court was established, Justice   said, after unfurling the national tricolour during the the Republic Day celebrations in the lawns of the court.

 The Acting CJ also listed statistics that showed that women participation at the district level judiciary too is on the rise. Out of the 25 principal district judges that are currently working as unit heads in 25 districts of   and Telangana, 12 of them are women. This is almost 50 percent.And about 23 percent of the total district judges are women.At the level of senior civil judges, the percentage of women is 28. And a whopping 47 percent of the junior civil judges in the two states are women,   declared with a sense of joy over this increased participation of women.
 
 Adding a note of caution that a lot needs to be done to maintain or improve this trend, the Acting CJ said: “While the increase in the number of women judges in different cadres is a matter of immense satisfaction, what needs to be addressed is the lack of enthusiasm in women joining the Bar in large numbers.“ Bar is a term used in the legal parlance to describe practising lawyers. Judges at all levels are collectively called as the Bench.
 
 The CJ in his speech also underlined the need to encourage young advocates from under privileged sections and gave a call to the developed sections in the Bar to undertake the task of guiding them through a dual strategy of teaching and financing till the time they are able to sustain themselves in the field. They are quitting and going in search of greener pastures, the CJ said.
