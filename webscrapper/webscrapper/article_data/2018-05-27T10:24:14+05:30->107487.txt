Your first name shapes the way other people perceive your age, personality and how good you are at your job — findings that could mean some classic psychology experiments were wrong.

 Leonard Newman at  , New   and his colleagues asked 500 college students to rate 400 popular male and female names from the past seven decades.
 
 When it came to warmth and competence, there was a clear gender effect. Names linked with low competence and high warmth tended to be female, like   and Melody. Conversely, those associated with high competence and low warmth tended to be male, like   and Reginald. “The results reflected gender stereotypes,” says Newman.
 
 Some names had particular age associations — for example,   and Bruce were consistently seen as older than Brittney and  . “If you give your child a fashionable name for the time, it might date them,” says Newman. “The only way around it is to choose a name that never seems to go out of style, like David or  .”
 
 The findings have implications for psychological experiments in hypothetical scenarios, says Newman. The scenarios are often designed to test one kind of unconscious bias, but may accidentally bring out other implicit prejudices. The names chosen for characters could skew the results, says Newman. For example, a famous ’60s experiment asked people to grade identical essays credited to ‘John’ or ‘Joan’ where Joan’s essay tended to score lower, indicating evidence of sexism. But because   is an older-generation name, bias could be with her perceived age.
 
 The research builds on earlier evidence of how our prejudices involving age, gender and race shape the way we prejudge people. Newman recalls his parents telling him that anyone with the name Barack Hussein Obama, (then a local politician) was unlikely to go far in US politics. “There are more important things than names,” he says.
