NEW DELHI:   was sent to   Jail on Monday after refusing to cooperate in the investigation into his murderous assault on his   on Sunday. However, he complained of ill health and was admitted to DDU Hospital in the evening. Omvir Singh, DCP (east) said that given his fragile mental condition, he will be kept under suicide watch in jail on discharge from hospital and will be questioned only when he calms down.

 In police custody on Sunday night, Matta became violent and tried killing himself and had to be tied up to protect himself. On Monday morning, he claimed innocence before reporters saying he had not set the   on fire. He said that the gas pipeline switch was on and police gunshots sparked the explosion. The 38-year-old, however, broke down when shown CCTV footage of him stabbing his father 36 times.
 
 Talking of the trigger, Matta told interrogators that he was humiliated by his parents last week. “They insulted me and said I was worthless though I only wanted a reconciliation.” The same day, he went out and bought a cleaver, the weapon he used to kill his father.
 
 Matta said that after his ouster he lived in a gurdwara for some days and slept in the open on three days. Strapped for cash, he also stayed with the woman he claimed he had married in July last year. When the cops questioned the woman, she denied the marriage but admitted to a live-in relationship with Matta.
 
 The FIR, which TOI has accessed, confirmed the sequence of Sunday’s events and the struggle of the cops to restrain Matta.
