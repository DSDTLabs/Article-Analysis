BATHINDA: Members of the Hindu, Sikh and Muslim communities in Moga took part in a candle light vigil on Tuesday night to protest against the killings of Amarnath pilgrims in Anantnag district of   and Kashmir. Over 100 people from all walks of life took part in the vigil and demanded that the Union government ensured fool-proof security for the devotees visiting the shrine.

 Moga MLA   led the march in which members of various organisations such as Baba Barfani Sewa Mandal, Kanwar Sangh Moga, Punjab Mahavir Dal, Parmeshardwar Society,   and Lions Club took part.
 
 The MLA said, “It was a cowardly act. Since terrorists have no religion, members from all communities are here to condemn the ghastly act. We urge the Centre and the Jammu and Kashmir government to ensure tight security for the pilgrims.”
 
 Muslim League members   and Safaroz Bhatt said, “The terrorists who kill innocent people are not true Muslims. A true Muslim doesn’t kill but protect people.”
