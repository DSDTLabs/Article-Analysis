HYDERABAD: A major chunk of the   (ORR), roughly 130 kilometres of the 158-km expressway, falls in jurisdiction of the   and   commissionerates. But only three speed guns are available with the traffic police to monitor the eight-lane access-controlled expressway, which logs over 50,000 vehicles per day. 

 Friday's accident on the ORR, which claimed lives of three IIT alumni in the Pahadishareef police station limits, was due to violation of speed limit when the erring driver was trying to overtake a DCM truck ahead of his vehicle. 
 
 Due to insufficient speed guns, the Cyberabad police in 2016 could book only 9,478 cases for speeding, which translated to roughly 26 cases per day. On the other hand, in Rachakonda limits, the average number of cases per day is about 80. 
 
 One of the main reasons for road accidents on the ORR is poor enforcement of speed limits set for each lane, as declared by the erstwhile Cyberabad commissionerate in 2014. Though most four-wheeler and other heavy vehicle drivers violate the speed limit on ORR, they were not coming under the scanner of traffic police as there were just three laser speed guns. 
 
 "To overcome the problem of insufficient speed guns in Rachakonda limits,   ( ), which built and operates the expressway, has given three more speed guns. They will be used from either Monday or Tuesday. We want to put them in use immediately. Each gun will cover a distance of 22 kilometres," Rachakonda additional deputy commissioner of police (Traffic) N   told STOI. 
 
 In Cyberabad, the HMDA was supposed to provide five more laser guns. Officials have also sent a proposal to limit the maximum speed on the ORR to 100 kmph instead of the existing 120 kmph.
 
 A motorist would be checked when he/she passes through the location where the speed gun-loaded police vehicle stands. Despite issuing e-challans for violating the speed limit, some motorists continue to violate the rule as they just need to shell out 1,400.
