PUNE: Spurred into action by Monday's physical and verbal assault on a woman traffic constable who was just doing her job, the city police have decided to slap criminal cases on such offenders. 

 If someone attacks police personnel repeatedly, they will be booked under the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act ( ).
 
 In   on Sunday, two men driving an SUV in the wrong direction verbally abused and kicked the woman traffic constable who had stopped the vehicle. Police arrested the two suspects under the sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his office duty) of Indian Penal Code. They were also booked for molesting the constable.
 
 City police commissioner Rashmi   said the police will come down heavily on such violators. "We will be mapping vulnerable spots in the city where such incidents are common. Local police personnel and beat marshals will assist the traffic police at these spots. Those who abuse or manhandle traffic personnel will be taken to task," Shukla said.
 
 In the first three months of the year, the police have already registered a whopping 57 cases under section 353, and in a majority of these cases, traffic policemen were at the receiving end. 
 
 Joint police commissioner Sunil Ramanand said, "Criminal cases will be filed against them, and we will try to file the charge sheet as soon as possible. Secondly, if somebody is doing it repeatedly, we will book him under the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities Act."
