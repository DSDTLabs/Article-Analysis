Krishnagiri: Seeing protagonists of the Tollywood epic drama   2: The Conclusion shooting three arrows at a time with a single bow, one would have wondered whether it was really possible to do so or it was just a technique that its director S S Rajamouli invented for the film.

 The   belonging to the Vijayanagara period discovered near Thally here on Thursday, however, seem to suggest that it was a centuries-old technique of war and a sign of bravery.
 
 A team of archaeologists belonging to Aram Archaeological Research Centre on Thursday came across as many as three hero stones at Gikur, a village near Thally close to Karnataka border in Krishnagiri district. Two of them showed fighters holding three arrows in their right hands and a bow in their left hands, while the remaining one depicted a fighter with sword and shield.
 
 According to Aram A Krishnan, president of Aram Archaeological Research Centre, one stone depicted two fighters at war. “One of the fighters was seen holding three arrows to shoot using a bow, while the second one was seen with a sword in his right hand and a shield in the left hand,” he said.
 
 “The fighter with sword and shield might have belonged to Kangars community, the members of which are known for their bravery,” Krishnan added.
 
 Gikur is situated close to Karnataka state border. Krishnan said the kings who ruled these regions might have deployed thousands of fighters on the borders to save their area from enemies. “These two fighters might have been killed in a fight arose out of a boundary dispute,” he said.
 
 According to the archaeologists, the hero stones belong to the 13th or 14th centuries. “Like Devasena, we too were astonished when Bahubali shot three arrows at a time with a single bow. But, the technique was in use as early as 13th or 14th century,” Krishnan added.
