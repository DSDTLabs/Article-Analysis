KOLKATA: A city youth, who is now the Labour Party’s parliamentary candidate from East Hampshire, has suspended campaigning for the forthcoming general elections to support families of those who have either died or were injured in the  .

 Condemning the attack, 29-year-old Rohit K Dasgupta, who was born in Bhowanipore and an alumnus of St James’ School and Jadavpur University, said: “These attacks are abhorrent and we condemn what has happened. There is nothing brave about attacking young and vulnerable at a concert.” 
 
 Reacting to back-to-back terror attacks, Dasgupta said from London, “This is the second attack in recent months but one of the many round the globe that have been targeting vulnerable people — The Pulse attack in USA, the UK parliament attack and the assassination MP Jo Cox last year — which London mayor Sadiq Khan pointed as: ‘Those who want to destroy our way of life and divide us will never succeed’. The UK is resilient and we will carry on’.”
 
  About Dasgupta’s next course of action, he said, “All campaigning has been stopped in respect of the families and friends of all those who died or were injured during the attack. Our immediate priority is to support them.  , the Greater Manchester mayor, has condemned these attacks and security arrangements are being reviewed whilst investigations are going on,” he said.
 
 But for some immigrants, the fear is quite palpable. Dasgupta had earlier admitted to once being called a terrorist. Many who have relatives in the UK are now worried if they will have to deal with similar comments and how such an incident can spark xenophobia. “I will remind people in late Cox’s words, we are far more united and have far more in common with each other than things that divide us. We acknowledge there will be people who will try to use this event to divide us and cause tension but we must not let that happen,” said Dasgupta.
