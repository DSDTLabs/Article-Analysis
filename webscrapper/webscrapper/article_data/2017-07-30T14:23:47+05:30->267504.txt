If there’s a will, there’s a way. Despite keeping a chock-a-block diary, singer-politician   continues to dedicate time for things that interest him. Among them is football. So, it didn’t come as a surprise when he was seen engaging in a match with common people at the India Gate. Incidentally, he is the vice-chairman of the organising committee of U-17   World Cup to be played in India from Oct 6. What’s more, the finals will be held in Kolkata. Those who have seen Babul from close quarters know he loves   gear and collects it from different parts of the world. Every time he comes to Kolkata, he would be seen playing football with his friends in the city, some of whom are singers. A fitness freak, Babul is also looking leaner and fitter. A lot of it is because of football.
