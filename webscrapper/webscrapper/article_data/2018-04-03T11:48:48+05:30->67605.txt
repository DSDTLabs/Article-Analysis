VILLUPURAM: The residents of villages surrounding a small temple dedicated to Lord Muruga at the confluence of two hillocks at Tiruvanainallur village in Villupuram district strongly believe that consuming lemonade made of   spiked on the sacred spear of the presiding deity will cure infertility.

 Scores of childless   visit the temple during the annual   festival every year to buy the lemons, auctioned by the temple management. Some people also strongly believe that consuming lemonade made from these sacred lemons will bring prosperity to their family.
 
 Nine lemons that were auctioned by the management at the end of the 11-day festival fetched a whopping Rs 1,02,900. Last year, nine lemons fetched Rs 68,000. The priests spike a lemon a day on the first nine days of the festival. The management auctioned the lemons on the last day of the festival on March 31.
 
 The lemon that is spiked in the spear on the first day of the festival is considered to be ‘most auspicious and powerful’. 
 
 A couple from Kundalapuliyur village–Sankar and Mahalakshmi– bought the lemon for a whopping Rs 35,500. All the lemons barring the one spiked on the ninth day of the festival were bought by   couples.
 
 The lemons used on the seventh day fetched Rs 9,500 while the lemons used on second, fifth and ninth days fetched Rs 8,500 each while the rest fetched Rs 8,100 each.
 
 “Eight childless couples bought the lemons while a businessman bought the lemon used on day nine seeking prosperity in his business ventures. The priests offered them sacred ash and dried fish rice before presenting the lemons,” said M Kanagasabesan, a village elder.
 
 Panguni Uthiram festival has been celebrated for several years at the temple. The villagers were not aware when the temple was built. “People strongly believe in the   powers of these sacred lemons. The temple management earlier distributed sacred lemons free of cost but decided later to   it following huge demand,” said a village elder.
