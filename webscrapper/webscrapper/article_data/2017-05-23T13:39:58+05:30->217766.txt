NAGPUR: The   (NMC) will collect only separated   from June 1. You will have to separate your garbage into dry and wet bins, if you want it to be carted away by  . The civic body will provide separate   to citizens at a cost of Rs14 crore. Green bins will be for wet garbage while blue bins will be for dry garbage.

 Mayor Nanda Jichkar and municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal convened a meeting of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to create awareness about garbage separation process on Monday. All the participating NGOs agreed to do the job.
 
 The NGOs which participated in the meeting include Rotary Club of Nagpur, Green Vigil, Centre for Sustainable Development, Maitri Parivar, Srushti Paryavaran Sanstha, Vriksh Samwardhan Samiti, Dhantoli Nagrik Mandal, Green Foundation, Swaccha Association, I Clean Nagpur etc.
 
 While the central government will start the scheme from June 5 to mark World Environment Day, NMC will do it from June 1 itself.
 
 Kaustav Chatterjee of Green Vigil had some suggestions for NMC. He said that some 200 workers should be employed to separate garbage during transit. “People won’t separate garbage at source from day one. These workers can do it at some place where garbage is collected. As people develop a habit, the number of such workers should be reduced, and after some time there will be no need for them,” he told TOI.
