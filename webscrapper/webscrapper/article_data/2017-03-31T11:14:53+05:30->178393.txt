YAVATMAL: During the last eight years, more than 3.5 lakh farmers in   have failed to repay their loan instalments, pegged at Rs. 2000 crore.

 Though the farmers were anticipating crop loan waiver proposal in the  , the State government did not pay attention to the opposition party’s demands. Taking advantage of the State government’s stand on  , the banking institutions started serving notices to the defaulting farmers to rush their dues immediately or get ready to face auction of their agricultural land mortgaged to the banks against crop loans.
 
 According to Yavatmal District Central Co-Operative sources, more than 3.58 lakh farmers, of which 1.98 lakh belong to YDCC bank alone, have been availing crop loan facility for the past eight years. The defaulters of nationalized banks go up to 1.60 lakh. The dues including interests are pegged at Rs. 2000 crore. Despite exercising the loan restructuring procedures, the farmers did not pay their dues.
 
 “We are making wide publicity to wake up the farmers for repayment of defaulted loans,” chairman of the YDCC Bank Manish Patil said, adding that even if the Govt finally succumbs to the pressure of opposition parties and opts for declaring some relief to the defaulting farmers, the regular payees of loan would also benefit from the govt sops.
 
 He urged the defaulting farmers to make payment of their dues regularly and avail of the crop loan afresh as per the set norms.
 
 The farmers in the district are living under constant threat of crop failure and this year the market prices of tur, soyabean and gram have also been slashed by the traders. Meanwhile, the debt-ridden farmers resorting to suicide may adversely impact the chief minister’s dream project ‘Baliraja Chetana Abhiyan’ launched in August 2015 to make Yavatmal a suicide-free district in two years time.
