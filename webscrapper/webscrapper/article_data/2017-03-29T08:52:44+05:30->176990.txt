PANAJI: The catch of three   which landed at   on Monday is being termed as accidental, but conservationists say monitoring the use of fishing methods may help   of the marine species and protect the endangered ones.

 All species of sawfish, which belong to the family of   (also called carpenter shark), have reduced drastically due to overfishing and habitat loss. Some fishermen stated that sawfish was caught occasionally many decades ago. 
 
 Reports of sawfish being caught along the Goa-Maharashtra coast have surfaced more recently. “This has come to our notice, but it is not clear what type of fishing methods are being used. The government machinery, including the fisheries department and coastal police, should find out how they are caught and if any illegal practice is followed, then it should take appropriate action because it is an endangered species,”  , fisheries scientist, National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), said.
 
 Goa became the first state to ban light emitting diodes (LED) in May 2016. Former president of Cutbona Boat Owners Union, Franco Martins alleged that some vessels land a huge catch using these lights despite the ban.
 
 Traditional fishermen, Goenchea Ramponkarancho Ekvott and All Goa Fishermen Union have been lobbying for a 90-day fishing ban due to the worrisome impact of aggressive and destructive fishing on marine resources.
 
 Director of fisheries department Shamila Monteiro said that the sawfish is a protected species. “But it may not be a targeted species by fishermen. We have sent circulars to fishermen’s cooperatives to release such species if caught by accident,” she said.
 
 Scientists and others suggest creating awareness among fishermen regarding the endangered species. “The threat to species like sawfish is serious as their population has reduced. If India can show it cares about one of the oldest species in the sea, the country will send the right message of its commitment to conservation ,” Ingole said.
