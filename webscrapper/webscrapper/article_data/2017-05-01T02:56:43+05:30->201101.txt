GURUGRAM: A 14-year-old girl has accused two of her neighbours of molesting her. Both the accused have been arrested and sent to judicial custody.

 According to police, the accused, who had moved to the area a few days back, stayed at a home opposite to the girl’s house and befriended her.
 
 On April 23, the girl was walking back home when she was approached by one of the accused, Gaurav, who told her that Satish, the other accused, wanted to meet her and had called her home. The girl told the police that when she went to meet Satish, he locked the door from inside and started touching her inappropriately. The girl couldn’t escape as the door was locked. It was only when Gaurav came back, he opened the door and the girl was able to escape.
 
 The girl did not tell her family about the incident for a week. According to her, the accused had threatened her of dire consequence, if she told anyone about it.
 
 An FIR has been registered under section 4 of the POCSO Act against Satish and section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC against both Satish and Gaurav.
