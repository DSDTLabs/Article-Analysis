NAGPUR: Union finance minister   provided a ray of hope for as many as 9   living in 424 slums. In his Union Budget presentation on Wednesday, Jaitley said that the government has proposed to construct 1 crore houses for the homeless by 2019.

 The PM   has been raised from Rs 15,000 crore to Rs 23,000 crore. He also announced that affordable housing will get infrastructure status. This move will boost the Nagpur Municipal Corporation and Nagpur Improvement Trust as they have already planned to provide housing for all.
 
 The scheme will run along with UPA government’s Basic Services For Urban Poor (BSUP) and Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) scheme. 
 
 At present, NMC has undertaken two projects — comprising 725 and 4,201 flats respectively — under the Slum Rehabilitation Authority. Besides this, NIT has also planned to construct 10,000 flats of which 6,000 for lower income group (LIG) and 4,000 for economic weaker section (EWS).
 
 “NIT has already started the process to identify the land it owns for developing the housing projects. NIT also sought land from the district administration and urban land ceiling department,” said an official from the Trust.
 
 Welcoming the announcement, mayor Pravin Datke said city MP and union minister for road transport and highways   had held a meeting with the officials of district administration, NMC and NIT and had asked them to submit a detailed project report under the central government’s new scheme — Housing For All By 2022. 
 
 Increase in allocation of funds for ministry of water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation will also help Nag River.
