BHOPAL: Six trees of Kat-Chandan were cut and stolen from the hyena enclosure at   on the night of February 1, leading to embarassment for the forest department and triggering queries on if it has happened earlier. 

 Officials of the National Park filed a complaint at Shyamla police station on Wednesday but there are no suspects yet.
 
 SI  , investigative officer in the case, said, “The trees could not have been taken by a single person. We have recovered cut branches from the spot as robbers took away only the trunk, which has high value in the market. We have questioned a few rangers and staff and they said they had no clue. They first learnt of it the next morning when the trees were gone.”
 
 The staff are present only till 6 pm. After that there’s only gate security and a patrol vehicle. “We suspect the gang entered through the lake by boat. There is no other way in except the main gate. We suspect an insider hand,” Ahirwar told TOI.
 
 A ranger said it is impossible to enter through the lake as there is double fencing. “They can enter only through the gate. Someone may have entered with a ticket and hidden behind the bushes till park staff left,” he said, adding that there is no CCTV inside the park.
 
 Park officials are questioning some staff. Some people have been deployed around the park to get to the truth, say sources. On Wednesday, officials got a call from Bagsewania police station informing that they have caught three robbers with chandan trees. Some rangers will be going there to identify if they are the stolen trees.
