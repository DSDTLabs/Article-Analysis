CHANDIGARH:   minister O P   said on Sunday that the ‘vyayamshalas (gymnasiums)’ being opened across the state by the Khattar government were common places for children, young and old, where yoga could be practised.

 “These can also be utilized for public interest by social or youth organisations. We have no objection if the   too wants to make use of these vyayamshalas,” Dhankar said, responding to the opposition party’s charge that there was a plan to use vyayamshalas and public parks for holding RSS shakhas.
 
 The minister’s remarks come at a time when Haryana is in midst of a row over the use of public places after right-wing organisations in Gurgaon objected to people performing namaz in the open.
 
 Replying to a question on INLD MP Dushyant Chautala’s demand for a white-paper on foreign visits of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, Dhankar, while talking to mediapersons in Hisar, said people knew well what used to happen during the foreign visits undertaken during the INLD regime.
 
 “Before demanding a white paper from the present government, the INLD should release a white paper regarding the foreign visits during its tenure. If the chief minister or minister of the present government goes on foreign tour, they go for work, not for excursions," he added.
 
 Dhankar informed that conceding the demand of the farmers of the state, the Haryana government had asked the Centre for permission to procure mustard crop over and above the 25 per cent limit imposed by the latter.
 
 "On the demand of farmers, we have sought permission from the Central government for the procurement of more mustard crop, and, if we get the permission, we would procure more mustard crop," he added while referring to the 25 per cent limit. PTI SUN ADS ADS 05132208 NNNN
