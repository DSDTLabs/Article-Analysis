 Sharma said two men, later identified as Ranjan Singh and Ravi Shankar Sharma, were sitting in the car. They forced him to sit between them and after travelling 200-300 metres one of them pulled out a knife and held it against Sharma’s throat.
 
 Instead of going towards Badarpur, Khan took a turn towards Kalkaji and drove to Saket. On the way, they forced Sharma to hand over his laptop, mobile phone and Rs 4,650 in cash. They stopped at a desolate spot near G-Block in Saket and pushed him out. The victim then lodged a police complaint.
 
 “A team led by SHO (Okhla) Mukesh Walia tracked down the cab owner with the help of the partial numberplate noted down by the complainant. Details of more than 20 cars were scanned before zeroing in on the right vehicle. Khan was caught after the owner, Naveen Jha, identified him from the description provided by Sharma,” said Biswal.
 
 Jha said that he had hired Khan on January 1 to drive the vehicle with a cab-aggregator service. Singh and Ravi were caught after Khan gave their whereabouts to the cops. Khan lived in Meethapur with Singh and Ravi and used to work in an export company in Noida as an unskilled labourer. 
 
 He took to crime as he was not earning enough to meet his needs. Singh was fond of fancy bikes and wanted to buy one.
