Bengaluru: After snapping a five-match losing streak at home with a four-wicket win against Kings XI Punjab on Friday, Royal Challengers Bangalore will look to maintain their winning form against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday afternoon.

 
 
 The biggest takeaway for   and Co in the two matches they have played this season has been the form of pacer Umesh Yadav. Following his two-wicket effort including that of danger man Sunil Narine in opening match, Yadav struck crucial blows on Friday with his pace and accuracy instead of variations.
 
 Kohli will hope for Yadav’s hot streak to continue. With that, the team’s search for a strike bowler over the past couple of seasons may well end. But the other main pacer Chris Woakes leaking runs during power play will be a cause for concern.
 
 Another worry for   is the brittle middle-order, especially Sarfaraz Khan. The young Mumbaikar, a surprise retention, has done little to justify the faith the team has shown in him. With six runs from two games, including a duck against Punjab, Sarfaraz may find his place in danger. A player who could benefit is local lad Pavan Deshpande.
