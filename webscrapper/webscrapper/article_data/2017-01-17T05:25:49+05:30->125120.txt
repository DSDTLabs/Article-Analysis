NEW DELHI: The Centre has suggested that state governments avoid using sketches, photos or logos of Mahatma Gandhi or his belongings such as his iconic spectacles,   or watch on walls of public toilets, garbage bins or any other places that could be considered dirty. 

 In a recent advisory issued to all the secretaries in-charge of sanitation, drinking water and sanitation ministry said this should be done "so that sentiment of anyone may (not) be hurt in implementing Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) programme." 
 
 The ministry has asked the department heads to issue similar directions to all districts and other authorities concerned. 
 
 The circular was issued following a case filed by one Badruddin Qureshi in Chhattisgarh high court against the use of sketches and photos or belongings of Gandhi on walls of public toilets and "filthy" places. 
 
 Though the court had dismissed the petition, it said, "We do not feel that this is such an infringement and disrespect to the father of the nation. But at the same time, we feel that Union of India must respond and assure on affidavit that wherever any symbol associated with Mahatma Gandhi is used, it shall be used and placed in such a fashion and that it cannot be easily defaced and should not be used in such a manner which causes disrespect to the father of the nation."
