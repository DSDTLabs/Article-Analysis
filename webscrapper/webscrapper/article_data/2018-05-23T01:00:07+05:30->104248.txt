Trichy: Heavy rain accompanied by gale destroyed thousands of   trees raised on hundreds of acres near Trichy. Officials from horticulture department inspected the damaged fields in person to ascertain the actual loss incurred by farmers from Somarasampettai, Vayalur and neighbouring villages in Trichy district.

 While farmers demanded compensation for their losses, the horticulture department insisted to bring their produce under insurance scheme. Officials stated that all farmers who lost their harvest had not insured their banana trees.
 
 Many parts in the district including Vayalur, Somarasampettai, Jeeyapuram, Kuzhumani and Anthanallur experienced heavy rain accompanied by winds on Monday night, which left more than 1.70 lakh banana trees raised on 147.5 acres of land damaged, farmers said.
 
 At least 1.50 lakh banana trees were destroyed in Vayalur and Somarasampettai area alone. Farmers in Vayalur suffered losses as the strong winds wiped out most of the trees which were in the stage of harvest. More than 10,000 banana trees in Somarasampttai area were damaged during the rain, the state organiser of the farmers’ wing of Tamil Manila Congress Puliyur A Nagarajan said. He urged the district administration to take steps to compensate losses.
 
 Joint director of Trichy horticulture department R Krishnamoorthy told TOI that the loss incurred in Vayalur was high compared to Somarasampettai. “We cannot take any preventive measure to safeguard banana trees from the gale. Even though farmers fix casuarina beside banana trees fr protection, it is better to get insurance cover. If they pay Rs 3,300 per acre, they would get Rs 60,500 in the event of any loss. However, no farmer has insured their banana trees under the scheme,” he said.
 
 After officials submit their report to the district administration, it will be forwarded to the revenue officials. Only the government will take the decision of announcing compensation, officials said.
