 “Recently, around 200 police officers from across the state had been given three-day training under ‘Kaaval’ scheme. The three-day training programme was conducted in the police training colleges in Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur. The training programme for ‘Karuthal’ will be conducted soon.

 DGP Loknath Behera, who inaugurated the workshop expressed concern over the growing number of child abuse cases reported from families. “Children should learn to distinguish between right and wrong and it should be taught from within the family. But, the problem is that if you analyse child abuse cases from January 2017 until now, a large majority of kids have been abused either by their family members or close relatives,” he said. 
 
 Almost 42 volunteers from across the state were given training at the one-day workshop.
