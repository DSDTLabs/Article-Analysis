Rajkot: Two incidents of firing in the air were reported from Gondal and Surendranagar on Tuesday night. 

 In Gondal, Renuka Singala (37), a resident of Nandanvan Society, alleged in her complaint that Ajaysinh Jhala, a resident of Ashapura Society, arrived with his associate and fired a round in the air after vandalizing her house. 
 
 “Singala said that Jhala had come to recover money from her brother in-law Dinesh. The accused arrived at her house when Dinesh was not present. Before firing, they hurled abuses at her and vandalized the household articles,” said Gondal city PSI R M Aradia, adding that police have launched a manhunt for the accused. 
 
 Another incident was reported from Surendranagar where a member of a group involved in the clash between two groups opened fire in the air at Miyanavas near Surendranagar tower chowk. The clash left five persons injured. The attackers had used iron pipes, bats and scythes in the attack. 
 
 “The group clash was the result of an old enmity between the two groups. There were three rounds fired in the air. We have booked 15 persons for the crime,” said Surendranagar city PSI K H Trivedi. 
 
 Those injured in the clash include three women. The injured have been identified as Noorbai Manek, Shakina Manek, Salma Manek, Iqbal Manek and Raja Manek, all residents of Miyanavas. 
 
 Police have launched a manhunt for Yaqub Bhatti, and his sons — Yunus, Javed and Hanif — who are suspected to have led the attack.
