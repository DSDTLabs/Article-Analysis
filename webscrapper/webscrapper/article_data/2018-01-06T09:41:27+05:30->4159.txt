GUWAHATI: Congress in the state on Friday alleged that there was 'deliberate negligence' by the   updating authorities in verifying documents in 208 NRC Sewa kendras of 13 districts where linguistic and religious minority groups are the dominant groups. 

 A delegation of the state PCC submitted a memorandum to state NRC coordinator   at his office demanding a full proof verification of the remaining 1.39 crore people as per the NRC rules and guidelines.
 
 The party also demanded correction of the errors in names and addresses of the people who have been covered in the first draft that was published on December 31 midnight.
 
 The memorandum stated that in 208 NRC   of 13 districts, the work of verification had not done properly and as a result, in those areas the names of only 10% of the population have appeared in the first draft.
 
 "It is very simple that if proper verification was done, under no circumstances the names of 90% population would be left out. These 208 Sewa Kendras are in Darrang, Morigaon, Nagaon, Goalpara, Dhubri, Cachar, Karimganj, Hailakandi, Kokrajhar, Barpeta, Mancachar, parts of   and Bongaigaon districts," the memorandum stated.
 
 "From the apparent view of the above situation, it reveals that religious minority and linguistic minority people are pre-dominant in the above 13 districts. Therefore utmost care should have been taken in verifying the documents of the applicants of the above 13 districts. I demand an enquiry in this matter," the memorandum added.
