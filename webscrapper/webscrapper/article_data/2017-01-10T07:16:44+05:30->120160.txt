HYDERABAD: Two months after the state government announced that it will go cashless, little has been done. The prolonged assembly session is eating up time. Senior officials are unable to prepare an action plan for government departments to shift to cashless transactions. 

  Chief minister   announced a number of initiatives after meeting Prime Minister   and formed a taskforce to transform the state into a cashless economy. In November 2016, the taskforce, headed by special chief secretary Suresh Chanda, was appointed. It was asked to prepare a road map and take necessary actions to improve digital transactions. Rao promised a report in three days. "The prolonged winter session has forced all government departments to concentrate on House proceedings. After the initial meetings, there was no interaction," said a senior official. 
 
  Though the taskforce has submitted its preliminary report and asked all departments for plans to shift to cashless activity, none of them submitted proposals. The taskforce suggested reduction of transaction fee at the time of debt, credit and RuPay card payments. For this, the finance and revenue departments need to meet and make a policy decision. 
 
  Some issues need to be taken up with the Centre. "Only after the assembly session will officials be able to focus on cashless activity," said Chanda. 
 
  The Telangana wallet is yet to see light of day as the app had many problems. Not many could operate the English-based app. Lack of bank accounts and connectivity issues have to be resolved. Officials said that if people are given more incentives, the number of e-transactions would increase further.
