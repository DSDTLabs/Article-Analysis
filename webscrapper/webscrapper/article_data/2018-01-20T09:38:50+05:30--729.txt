 The Manipur chief minister, however, in another tweet pulled up Air India for the "poor and inefficient" management at the Guwahati airport.

 He also said that the Air India has sent "men and material" from Kolkata to Guwahati to check the aircraft and they are on the job of making the aircraft air worthy.
 
 The spokesperson further said that the Air India is operating an additional flight to fly stranded passengers which will depart for Imphal this afternoon.
