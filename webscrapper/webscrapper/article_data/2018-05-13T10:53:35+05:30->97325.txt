JALPAIGURI: Six of a family, including a child, and a driver drowned in a pond when the car they were travelling by fell into it. The incident occurred at Jiranpur village, around 15km from  , early on Saturday. 

 
 The victims were returning home to Sahapatti in Vetaguri after attending a wedding at Baxirhat near the Cooch Behar-Assam border. At Jiranpur, the driver lost control of the car and it fell into the pond around 4am.
 
 Locals who heard the crash got out and went towards the pond, but could not see the car or its passengers as the vehicle had already submerged. However, the huge ripples made them suspicious and two of them dived in to check. They managed to pull out two persons but they were already dead. Then they informed the police.
 
 The bodies of all victims - Sadhan Saha (36), Gopal Saha (32), Balaram Saha (45),   (28),   (42),   (22) and Nishita Saha (5) - were later fished out of water.
