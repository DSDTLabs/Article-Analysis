Kolkata: The West Bengal Medical Council (WBMC) has found two doctors in Kolkata guilty of “infamous conduct in professional respect” and decided to remove their names from the list of registered medical practitioners. The two doctors in turn will move the court against this judgment by WBMC.

 “This order is very distressing and I will appeal to the court,” said Dr Mridula Vohra, a gynaecologist whose name the WBMC has decided to strike off from its registration list for 18 months.
 
 The WBMC has also cancelled the registration of Dr Mathew P John, a general surgeon, for 24 months, and the decision has been communicated with the Bihar Council of Medical registration, as he is registered with it, for consideration and compliance. 
 
 “I have no intimation on the judgment. Once I get it, I have two options — either to accept it or appeal against it in the court,” said Dr John.
 
 The case of medical   against the two doctors goes back to April 2012 when Dimple Bawa (55) had a hysterectomy at Belle Vue Clinic after consulting Dr Vohra. The homemaker from New Garia was subjected to three other surgeries in the next five months due to an infection caused by a foreign object left in her abdomen after the first surgery.
 
 An MRI done at a private diagnostic centre on June 14 detected the foreign body in the patient’s abdomen. At Vohra’s suggestion, the patient underwent another surgery for sinus tract infection on the abdominal wall at CMRI on June 19 under Dr John. Both doctors allegedly said no foreign body was found.
 
 Surdev Bawa, the patient’s husband, lodged an FIR against the two doctors at Shakespeare Sarani police station on January 27, 2013. Later on, Bawa approached the WBMC, accusing the duo of medical negligence. Orders signed by WBMC registrar Manas Chakraborti on September 21 and 22 respectively (TOI has copies of both) penalises the two doctors. “I had faith in the system and it stands vindicated,” said Bawa.
