While Sindhu looked a little nervous, Gopichand looked relaxed, waving at the guests even as he turned to put his ward at ease with a casual “What’s up!” Before taking to the stage Gopi was spotted hooting and cheering as the athletes walked the ramp. “They were all wonderful,” said Gopi when we caught up with him.
