HYDERABAD: More than 50% of people diagnosed with peripheral vascular disease ( ) or   (PAD) will also develop cardiac and brain-related complications, which makes the diseases life-threatening, said doctors, lamenting poor awareness levels. September is PAD awareness month.“Common causes of PAD include smoking, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol levels. Symptoms include pain in the legs, discolouration or blackening of limbs and dead tissue or gangrene,“ said Dr A Sharat Reddy , consultant interventional cardiologist and endovascular specialist at   in  .

 “Alarmingly , even today, in a majority of PAD cases, patients end up losing their limbs to the disease. This is caused mainly due to late detection which can be attributed to the low awareness on vascular diseases,“ he said.
 
 Dr Narendranadh, consultant (vascular and endovascular surgery) at KIMS Hospital,  , said that early diagnosis can lead to lower mortality rates associated with PAD.
 
 “Most of the vascular disease related morbidity and mortality can be reduced with early diagnosis and prevention. Vascular disease is as common as cancer and heart disease, among the general population.It is estimated that a total of 30% of people affected with PVD die within five years. The mortality rates increase in the late stages of PVD, thus making it very important to detect this disease in the early stages,“ said Dr Narendranadh, consultant (vascular and endovascular surgery) at KIMS hospital in Secunderabad.
 
 While the incidence of PAD among patients typically increases with age, many youngsters are also being diagnosed with the disease today , with heavy smoking and alcohol consumption habits being identified as two major causes.
 
 “Smoking habits and heavy alcohol consumption have emerged as two top reasons for youngsters being diagnosed with PAD. The sedentary lifestyle and early onset of diabetes are also linked to PAD," added Dr Reddy.
