LUCKNOW: In a  , scientists of biotechnology department of   and  , Saudi Arabia, have identified the gene which increases the  , its recurrence and development of drug resistance.

 In a research lasting over four years, scientists studied more than 2,000 international researches by experts across the world and came to the conclusion that the gene MIF-173 G>C gene polymorphism is responsible for the aggravation of TB, an ailment affecting large populace across globe, particularity in Asia and India. The study has been published in the ‘Scientific Reports’ of Nature group.
 
 Using  , the scientists studied the data by extracting similar information from published research papers about the gene. They used a special software to zero in on the commonalities in scientific studies.
 
 “A number of researches have been conducted globally to find the reason behind TB recurrence and drug resistance making the treatment tough. The study found that MIF-173 G>C gene polymorphism increases the risk of TB,” said Prof BN Mishra, department of biotechnology, AKTU. He said the study has identified the gene and it will help develop drugs targeting the same.
 
 He said at times it’s difficult to find out whether a patient is infected or not, and the study will also help in diagnosis. The research also revealed that the Asian population is more susceptible to TB with MIF-173 G>C gene polymorphism.
 
 According to WHO, India alone accounts for around 2.79 million cases of TB, hence the study plays an important role as it can assist the pharmacological targeting to keep a tab on the disease, he added.
