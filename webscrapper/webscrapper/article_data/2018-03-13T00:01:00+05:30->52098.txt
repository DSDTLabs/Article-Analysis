What happens when you are nudged out of your   and subjected to challenges that might compel you to rethink your perspective towards nature and the society? Comfortable in your own space, we tend to overlook many of our own activities that might be harming others. Dancer-choreographer   is asking these questions in her upcoming   performance in the city.

  “The 
  is an extension of my two previous projects – titled 
  and 
 . It is an experimental piece of work that poses questions such as ‘Are you in this specific comfort zone? And what happens when you step out of it, by choice or by force?’ In a world where one is often visually bombarded with several things, it becomes pertinent to question why they exist within a given framework,” says Archana. Electronic sound artiste and DJ Rahul Giri will provide live music for the solo act, which is scheduled to take place at a venue in Koramangala on March 15. 
 
  The narrative puts special focus on the ‘cycle of abuse in nature’. While 
 was inspired by the life and death of singer-songwriter   and why it is important to talk about private struggles in people’s life, in 
 , Archana was seen eating a raw fish on stage. So, how comfortable is she as an artiste to pull up such an act? “Yes, it is kind of nerve-wracking and I had to completely numb myself to do it, but that scene was important to convey the message of the performance,” she sums up.
