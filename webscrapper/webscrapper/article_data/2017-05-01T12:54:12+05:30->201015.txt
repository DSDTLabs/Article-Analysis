BHOPAL: In a novel initiative to bring about   in children towards sanitation and hygiene, an NGO is distributing toffees to children who use public toilets.

 Backed by the Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) along with the district administration, the initiative has been a game-changer of sorts to reorient strategies and achieve the goal of Swachh Bharat Mission.
 
 “There are over 500 slums across Bhopal. Many children often defecate in the open. Our aim is to motivate these children to use public restrooms and in the process provide them an incentive to grab a sweet,” said  , a representative of the NGO.
 
 The outreach programme is part of a new set of programmes initiated by the NGO to reorient strategies that will help to maintain a cleaner and healthier environment in the city.
 
 “The NGO is offering sweets to children who use the public toilets. Their volunteers are located near public restrooms in various wards of the city,” said Mahesh Gaur, a BMC health officer.
 
 According to BMC estimates, there is an urgent need for around 20,000 toilets in Bhopal. The civic body has been on a construction spree to develop the basic infrastructure. “Much of the task has been completed. The aim now is to develop and bring about change in the mindsets of people,” Gaur said.
 
 Last year, Bhopal mayor Alok Sharma’s ‘roko-toko’ campaign, which aimed at blowing whistle and dissuading people who defecated in the open was met with a poor response. Sharma and other BMC politicians were criticised for being insensitive.
