KANPUR: A 38-year-old woman in Unnao, who was allegedly raped and threatened by a local   (SP) corporator and his aide in May 2017, approached   on Saturday, seeking action against the accused.

 While the FIR in this case was lodged at   police station in October 2017, the case was highlighted on Saturday when the woman approached the   SP.
 
 Talking to reporters at the SP office, the woman alleged that the corporator and his aide took turns to rape her and film the act. “They later started blackmailing me asking me to keep going to them. They also threatened to circulate the video on internet if I did not oblige. They also threatened to kill my husband and child,” she said.
 
 The woman, while alleging police inaction for the last six months, said, “I visited the SP office twice in the past but nobody paid heed to my complaint. My FIR was lodged only when media took cognisance. I even attended the tehsil diwas and gave application to the DM but nothing happened. They (the corporator and his aide) have bribed the police to evade action. We are running from pillar to post for the last six months.”
 
 The woman’s husband, who was accompanying her, supported her allegations. “We approached the police with our complaint against the corporator and his aide but no action was taken. I even went to the CM’s place but nothing happened,” he said. Police, however, have termed the charge as “fake”. “It is a fake case. The matter was thoroughly investigated and the rape charge was found to be false. It was on this basis that a final report (FR) was submitted to a local court on December 23. Hearing on the report will take place on May 14 where both sides will get a chance to raise objections to the FR. We will proceed as per court order,” SHO Safipur   told TOI.
 
 SHO further said that he took charge of the Safipur police station a couple of months back but the woman never came to him with her complaint.
