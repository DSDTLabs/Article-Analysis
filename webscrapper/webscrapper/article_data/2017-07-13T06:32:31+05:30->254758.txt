CHENNAI: Mounting fiscal deficit is posing concerns for the Tamil Nadu government. As against a projected fiscal deficit of 4.58% of GSDP for 2016-17, - as mentioned in the annual budget presented in February - the actual deficit for   was 4.69%.

  The revenue through stamps and registration source come down by 33% compared to the 2016-17 budget presented by then finance minister   in the presence of former chief minister  .
 
 The revised 2016-17 budget projected that the stamp and registration revenue would be Rs 10,548.25 crore. In February 2017, the revenue estimated from registration was scaled down to Rs 7,985 crore, a shortfall of 24%. But in the policy note presented by the commercial taxes department on Wednesday, the total revenue for the last financial year from stamp and registration source was only Rs 7,007.74 crore.
 
  Compared to 2016-17 budget projections, the stamp and registration revenue has come down by Rs 3,540.74 crore. The registration revenue in 2015-16 was Rs 8,562.38 crore.
 
 Financial analysts as well as economists told TOI that there are more reasons than what the commercial taxes minister K C Veeramani said in the assembly. “After the Madras high court stopped registration of unapproved layouts last year, for nearly 8 months registrations came to a standstill. This is the reason for lower revenue from this source,” said Veeramani. The issue was raised by Avadi AIADMK MLA ‘Ma Foi’ K Pandiarajan in the assembly.
 
 “The main reason for shortfall in the stamp revenue is the wrong projection in the revised 2016-17 budget as well as the revised estimates presented in February this year. When the government knew that the court had stayed the registration, how did they estimate that the revenue will be Rs 7,985 crore in February,” wondered financial analyst and DMK MLA Palanivel Thiagarajan.
 
 “The other reason is the prevalence of high guideline value due to which many people did not register their lands or buildings. The government must have estimated the revenue based on the revised estimation for 2015-16 instead of the actual revenue. Estimation must be done only from the actual revenue,” said Thiagarajan.
 
 “The government must revise its revenue deficit as there is a revenue shortfall. Following this, the fiscal deficit must also be revised. The government in February blamed Tamil Nadu joining Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (Uday) for the higher fiscal deficit in the revised 2016-17 estimates as it had to take over Tangedco’s debt. But there is also a big gap in the revenue that year,” said   economist R Srinivasan.
