Failing to comply with the directions will result in the units being shut down, the department said.

 In a meeting held recently between EPCA and officials from NCR states to assess the pollution control measures, officials from the environment department and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) had informed the move to EPCA, stating that letters had already been sent to around 700 such units, while more letters will be sent in the coming days — a move that was appreciated by the Supreme Court body.
 
 “We have given directions that all industries in the city must convert to PNG till March 15 or they will be shut down. This is a move towards switching to cleaner fuel options. A lot of the industries have already started the process and we are sending more letters currently,” the department official said.
 
 The official also said certain areas had a problem in terms of gas lines, however, they are looking at options like providing subsidies if required. “We have askedIGL to let us know if any help is required in terms of subsidy. We will look into all aspects to ensure industries don’t face a problem,” said the official.
