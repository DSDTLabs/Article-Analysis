HYDERABAD: It was ordered that my name be removed from my own   for being a transgender woman. My son was told to never call, see or write to his father ever again because his dad is a little bit different than other dads, said   advocate and co-founder of non-profit `Your True Gender' Jessica  .

 Formerly known as Jeffrey Butterworth, Lynn was in the city, speaking to a room packed with students and faculty at the International Institute of Information TechnologyHydera bad (IIIT-H), about her journey as a transgender woman and parent, on Tuesday. Lynn is the only biological parent in U.S history whose name was removed from her child's birth certi ficate due to her transition.
 
 “It was only in the late 80's that I found out that it was possible to undergo gender transition. The surgery, however, was very expensive and lasted more than seven hours. After the sex change surgery , I felt that I was now living my true gender and I never thought of suicide again,“ said Lynn, who added that she relied on `coping mechanisms' or `escapes' such as getting involved in hobbies such as painting and playing soccer in order to avoid confronting the fact that she `wanted to be a girl', from a very young age.
 
 For several years now, Jessica Lynn has spoken at several institutions in the US and across the world, including   and   , to educate students and faculty on gender equality
