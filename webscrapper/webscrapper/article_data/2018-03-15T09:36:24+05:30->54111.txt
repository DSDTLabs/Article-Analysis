KOCHI: Paving way for starting   facilities at   medical college,   (KMSCL) has delivered the medical equipment required for starting the facility. Authorities of Ernakulam medical college had placed orders with KMSCL for procuring the equipment a couple of months ago. 

 At the same time, the post of cardiologist which was created a year ago after pressure exerted by media still remains vacant. 
 
 "Without the services of a cardiologist, cathlab can't be functional. We have been demanding the government to fill the post of cardiologist. It may take a couple of months for completing the installation of machines and securing various permits required for starting the operations. Unless, the health department is able to fill the vacancy of cardiologist, the cathlab will remain unused," said Dr N K   of  . 
 
 "After a long wait, a doctor from another medical college expressed his willingness to join government medical college, Ernakulam. But, the cardiologist hasn't joined so far. If he is not ready to join, health department should consider the requests by other cardiologists," he said.
 
 PWD has completed around 75% of renovation works of the five-storeyed building where the cathlab facilities are to be opened. "Now, the KSEB is to provide electricity connection to the building. We also have to get some other certificates from various agencies before starting the services," an official with the medical college said.
 
 Meanwhile, PWD is learnt to have demanded more funds for completing the work. Earlier, the government had allotted Rs 2 crore for the renovation of the block where the facilities including cathlab will come up. 
 
 According to the PWD officials, the cost escalation of raw materials due to GST and other reasons has necessitated more funds for the completion of the work, officials said. The medical college authorities haven't started any measures to sort out the issue of fund shortage so far.
