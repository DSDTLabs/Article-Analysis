Vadodara: On Thursday, Ashok Prajapati and his wife who have been delivering couriers for the last 12 years were all smiles as their younger daughter Shefali was among the five students from the city to clear CA final exam.

 Prajapati said that he wanted Shefali to become a doctor but due to their financial conditions, she had to opt for commerce stream. However, she did not disappoint her parents as she stood first in entire district in class XII commerce stream and then clearing both groups of CA final on Thursday.
 
 “We could not afford tuition classes for any of our three children but after Shefali stood first in class XII, a private trust approached us to fund her further studies. It was because of the trust she could take up coaching for CA,” said Prajapati. Interestingly, Prajapati too was a CA student, but he had to leave the course in between to support the family after his father passed away.
 
 Prajapati, who delivers couriers on a bicycle, also said that after Shefali excels in her work, it is his wish that she should educate at least 100 children from financially weak background.
 
 Shefali’s elder sister finished her engineering from MS University and got a job around six months back while her younger brother is pursuing post-graduate in mechanical engineering.
