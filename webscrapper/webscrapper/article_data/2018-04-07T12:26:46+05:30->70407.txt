Renowned flautist  , who has also composed music for films like  ,  , Lamhe,   and more, was in the city a few weeks back. When asked if he would like to compose music for films again, he said, "Why not? If musical films like Anaarkali, Mughl-e-Azam and   are made today, I would like to compose music for Bollywood again. If a historical or religious film of such stature is made today, I will surely be a part of that film."
Commenting on today’s Bollywood music, he says, "Present day Bollywood music achha hai aaj ke hisaab se. Aajkal log sur aur swar pe dhyaan nahi dete, bachche jis par jhoom uthe wahi music accha hai. So, if the present generation likes this kind of music, then it must be good only. But what I feel is ki phir puraani music ka zamana aayega, bahut jaldi aa jayega."
 The Allahabad-born flute legend has many fond memories of Lucknow. "I have many memories associated with this city. The most memorable moment is of the   which I was awarded in 1994. Since I have been a frequent visitor to the city, I used to get to know about several music programmes happening here till a few years back. But I don’t know why the trend has faded away now. I wish Lucknow hosts many music programmes as it used to earlier," recalls Pandit Hariprasad.
