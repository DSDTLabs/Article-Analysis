Kashinath’s demise is a big loss because he introduced a big talent pool that still continues to entertain. One among them is filmmaker  . “I consider him as my first guru. He was the first person to give me work. When I came to Bengaluru, he gave me a shelter under his roof and also the opportunity to assist him in various departments in  . I consider it my good fortune that the first film I worked in remains a landmark film of the 80s, with it being a blockbuster in every other language it was remade in,” says Sunil.
He says that   breathed cinema all his life. “Over his four decades, he only knew cinema and was passionate to create entertaining cinema. He will remain as someone who has created his own niche in the industry. He will also remain one of the few people in the film industry across the globe to have as many as 11 releases in one year, which is hard to beat. His   lay in the fact that he was a simple man and that appealed to his viewers. He was a trendsetter in the 80s, when it came to taking popular cinema to the masses with a more relatable tone,” says Sunil, adding how Kashinath remained upbeat about entertaining people till the end. 
 Sunil also recalls how Kashinath used to be very inquisitive about the work done by his disciples. “He used to always be encouraging and would never shy away from expressing how he felt. His legacy remains in the fact that so many of the people he has introduced in films, be it directors like   or actors like  , still continue to carry forth his baton when it comes to giving undiluted entertainment. I’ll always be fortunate to consider myself to be a part of this list,” he says, adding Kashinath’s gentle and simplistic nature was seen even in how he concealed the fact that he was suffering from cancer and chose to entertain people in films till the end.
