CHENNAI: Three Indians --- top seed  , qualifiers   and   --- made it to the quarterfinals of the  , a $25,000   event in London late on Tuesday. 

 Returning to the professional circuit after more than a month's gap, Ghosal faced Olli Tuominen of Finland in the opening round, a recent winner in the Oregon Open in the US. However, Ghosal went on to win 11-4, 11-9, 11-8 in 32 minutes to get ready for England's Joe Lee next.
 
 Mahesh's encounter with eighth seed Ivan Yuen of Malaysia was a lot closer. The five games he had to play, seemed more to do with his own temperament after holding the whip hand, than the Malaysian's enterprise. Spurning match ball situations twice in the match, Mahesh stretched the tussle through his own inabilty to finish off the big points in time. Nonetheless the Indian managed to squeeze out a 11-6, 12-10, 10-12, 10-12, 11-7 win in little under two hours. Mahesh faces a tougher fight next --- third seed Tom Richards (Eng).
 
 Vikram, on the other hand, looked more composed in facing the seventh seeded Egyptian Mohamed Reda. Both showed the finesse in the strokes, finding the lengths and the area above the tin. But as it happened, the Egyptian's physical status seemed in question as a touch laxity enabled Vikram to forge ahead decisively. In the end it seemed a comfortable 11-8, 11-4, 11-2 passage. Vikram faces the second seed Nafiizwan Adnan of Malaysia next.
