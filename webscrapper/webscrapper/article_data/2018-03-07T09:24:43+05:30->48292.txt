HYDERABAD: AIMIM leader and Hyderabad MP   has called for the arrest of Sri Sri Ravi   over his alleged objectionable remarks on the Babri Masjid issue. 

 Sri Sri Ravi Shankar had allegedly made statements, which were reported in the media, to the effect that India would bleed like   if the Babri Masjid row was not settled out of court. 
 
 "This is nothing but threatening us. When the matter is sub-judice, with what motive is Sri Sri Ravi Shankar making those statements?" Asaduddin Owaisi asked. "He has committed contempt of court by speaking about a matter that is pending in the  ." 
 
 The MIM leader said that in the wake of the threatening talks, he has appealed that the Supreme Court should take up the proceedings on the Babri case only after the 2019 general elections. 
 
 Asked if he would lodge a complaint against Ravi Shankar, Owaisi told TOI: "If law is broken, it is the primary responsibility of the government to file a case and arrest the person, which in this case, the   government has not done." 
 
 He said that if the same statement had been made by him, it would be made to appear as if he wanted to turn India into another Syria. "I would then be facing arrest and cases would have been filed against me in 10 different places. This is the reality. Ravi Shankar can say whatever rubbish and provoke and incite people, but the government and media treat him with velvet gloves," he said.
