Rajkot: The Bhavnagar police on Saturday denied that 21-year-old Dalit man Pradeep Rathod of Timbi village in Umrala taluka was killed for keeping a horse.

 Superintendent of police (SP), Bhavnagar, Pravin Mal addressing media on Saturday evening said that they have not found an prima facie evidence that Pradeep was killed by some member of upper caste community because the deceased had bought a horse.
 
 “We have rounded up all the persons named in the FIR, but found no evidence to charge them. We did not find anything to support the allegation that he was killed because he bought a horse,” Mal told media persons.
 
 Giving the details of the facts that came out during the investigation Mal said, “Prima facie it comes out that Pradeep was killed because of personal animosity. Number of villagers have in past complained about Pradeep’s character.” 
 
 Describing further he said, “We have complaints stating that Pradeep used to do stunts on horse and use motor bikes outside girls’ school in his and neighbouring villages. He (Pradeep) has also been accused of molesting a nurse outside the village hospital. However, the nurse did not lodge a formal complaint. There have been cases of his scuffle with other students while he was in the school.”
 
 Mal also claimed that Pradeep had an affair with a woman of his community in Mumbai and had brought her to his village where she stayed for two months. “Pradeep was still in the contact of that woman and that relation could also be the reason behind the murder. We are investigating all the angles.” 
 
 Police has formed four teams to investigate the murder case, two teams of Local Crime Branch, one team of Special Operation Group and one team of Palitana police is investigating this murder.
