Nagpur: “Children are victims of their parents’ expectations and desires. These days, parents are not ready to accept failures of their children,” said Dr Prabodh Yene, a counsellor and psychotherapist. 

 He was speaking at a seminar on ‘Parenting in 21st century: Challenges and remedies’ organized by Sakhe Sobati Foundation and Association of Counsellors and Psychotherapist (ACP), Nagpur, at Kavi Kulguru Kalidas Auditorium, Persistent Systems, on Sunday. 
 
 Dr Yene said that parents should interact with children and expose them to different experiences. They must also give them time to explore things. “Parents merely focus on their careers and improving standard of living of the family. They don’t give time to their children. Parents express their love by providing materialistic things. Hence, children face problems in their adolescence,” he said.
 
 “Becoming a   is a biological process but parenting is a psychological process. It tests you on every stage of your life. You must trust your children and respect their decisions,” Dr Yene added. 
 
 Describing a mother’s role in a child’s life, career counsellor Poonam Menariya said that parenting is a learning process. “Mothers love and nurture children. They are also their guides. It is their responsibility to make children self-reliant,” she said. 
 
 Experts discussed role of siblings, especially to teach children the value of sharing, difference between caring and over caring and importance of joint family and grandparents while raising kids. They also discussed importance of communication between parents and children, especially during adolescence.
 
 The programme was conceptualized by Dr Chetan Rewatkar, counsellor and psychotherapist.
