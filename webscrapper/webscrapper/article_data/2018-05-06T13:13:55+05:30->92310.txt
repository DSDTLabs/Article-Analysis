THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: All India   and children welfare association has requested the state government to postpone the higher secondary   schedule so that   and   students too would be able to participate in the process. 

 
 "Children who pursued CBSE and ICSE syllabus should also be given an opportunity to participate in the higher secondary admission procedure. Since Class X results of both ICSE and CBSE streams have not yet been announced, the government should postpone the schedule," the association representatives said in a memorandum submitted to education minister C Raveendranath.
 
 As per the current schedule, the admission procedure would begin on May 9. Sources said CBSE and ICSE results are likely to be published by 21 May.
 
 A copy of the memorandum was submitted to higher secondary education director as well.
 
 Last year, following similar pleas, the state government had postponed the admission schedule to suit CBSE and ICSE students as well. If the government refuses to extent the date, the association may approach the high court.
