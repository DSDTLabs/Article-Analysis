Salem: While political drama was unfolding in Chennai with assembly Speaker Dhanapal disqualifying 18 rebel MLAs backing TTV Dhinakaran, the main protagonist of the whole plot, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami went about his business, participating in various functions and meetings in Salem district on Monday. All these meetings and programmes had been pre-scheduled.

 Addressing party workers at a discussion meeting on ‘MGR centenary celebration’ in Salem, Palaniswami said DMK’s daydream to form the government after Jayalalithaa’s demise shattered due to AIADMK cadres’ strength and unity. “AIADMK was the only party in the country to get reunited after a split,” he said. No one will shatter AIADMK government even in future and we will get ‘two leaves’ symbol at the earliest, he said.
 
 Palaniswami said only heirs will come to power in DMK. “Whereas in AIADMK, anyone who is loyal to the party could come to any of the high posts,” he added. 
 
 He urged the party cadres to work for the party’s victory in local body elections. “There are 60 wards in Salem Municipal Corporation and all the 60 wards should be captured by AIADMK,” he said, adding that the cadres should prove Salem as AIADMK’s strong fort through the victory. 
 
 The MGR centenary celebration will be held in Salem on September 30. 
 
 Later, he inspected the pre-arrangements for MGR centenary celebrations at government engineering college premises at Karuppur in Salem. 
 
 Later, he went to Omalur to discuss with party functionaries and cadres there.
