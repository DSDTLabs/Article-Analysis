Vadodara: Participants in   (VM) may have to undergo anti-doping tests this time. 

 The Vadodara Marathon (VM) is planning to approach the   (NADA) for the first time since it began the race in the city in 2009. If NADA gives a go-ahead, then some of the participants in the full marathon may undergo the tests. 
 
 “The issue was discussed in a meeting on Tuesday and we have decided to approach NADA. With VM getting increasing participation from professional runners for half and full marathon, we want to ensure that the race is conducted more professionally and fairly,” said VM chairperson, Tejal Amin. Currently, anti-doping tests are being conducted at marathons in Mumbai and Bangalore. 
 
 Association of International Marathons and Distance Races secretary Hugh Jones said that the chances of doping depends on the prize money offered by the marathon organizers and if the amount is high, chances of doping also go up. “The   is done randomly on any participant after the race,” Jones said. 
 
 VM officials said that the cost of conducting anti-doping tests is borne by the organizers. 
 
 Jones measured the marathon routes late on Monday night and race director Baptist D’Souza has given a go ahead for the race. VM has arranged for showers en route for full and half marathon runners apart from sponging facilities. 
 
 “We have worked out the route and also coordinated with the police department that guided us to ensure that the participants as well as traffic don’t face any problem,” Amin added. “I have been with VM since the first marathon and I must say that it is growing fast. Most importantly it is organized by volunteers and it showcases the spirit of the city,” D’Souza said.
