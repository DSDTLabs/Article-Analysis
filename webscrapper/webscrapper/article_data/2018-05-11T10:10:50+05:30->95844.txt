A. We have been lifting the garbage that has been dumped at this location. Garbage removal also takes place on Sundays. Previously, there was a demand to remove a garbage container that had been placed at this spot to avoid illegal dumping. We have assigned waste-pickers in this area for door-to-door garbage collection as well. But citizens too should ensure that they hand over the garbage only to these wastepickers and not dump the same on the road. (Deepak Dhelwan, senior sanitary inspector,  )

 A. These vehicles carry wet waste that can cause rusting of parts such as number plates. We do change plates. It is mandatory for us to have visible number plates at the time of getting permits from RTO. Covers are also being given to us by the solid waste management department. We will follow up to get the covers. (Kishor Pol, head of PMC vehicle department)
