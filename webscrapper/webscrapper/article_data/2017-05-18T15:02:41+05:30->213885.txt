CHENNAI: A 15-year-old student and a 20-year-old man who tried to save him from drowning died in the sea near INS Adyar, just north of  , on Wednesday.

 Passersby alerted the local police about two bodies that washed ashore on the beach near the   office. Policemen retrieved the bodies and sent them to   for postmortem.
 
 Police identified them as Manimaran Radhakrishnan, 20, of Namakkal, and Dinesh Kumar, 15, a school student from Vellore. Radhakrishnan and Kumar were in two separate groups of friends on a visit to the city, a police officer said. “Kumar entered the sea and was engulfed by a big wave that threatened to drag him away from the shore,“ the officer said. “Radhakrishnan dived in and started swimming toward Kumar in a futile attempt to save him. Both of them drowned.“
 
 The officer, attached to the   police, said 41people drowned off Marina Beach and nearby in 2015; police recorded as many drowning deaths in the same area a year later. South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association president K Bharathi said many youngsters who have learned how to swim in a pool drown because they are overconfident about their ability to cope in the sea. “Swimming pools have a limited depth and, more importantly, the water in them is calm at all times,“ he said. He added that police should put up more signboard warnings against swimming, especially off Marina Beach.
