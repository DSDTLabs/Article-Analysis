Tanwar said he was attending a party programme in Kurukshetra and when Rahul passed through the town. He received the Congress vice-president and had a brief chat with him.
 
  Hitting out at the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, Tanwar said, "The voice of the poor, Dalits and Adivasis of this country cannot be suppressed. Trying to stop Gandhi from reaching out to the victims of the violence is akin to crushing democratic rights of the citizens." Gandhi on Saturday met the victims of Saharanpur caste clashes and their family members at the district's border after authorities denied him permission to visit the violence-hit area in Uttar Pradesh.
