NAGPUR:  , an   from the city working for protecting environment, has set a target of collecting 1 lakh seeds that would be distributed and sowed during monsoon to enhance greenery.

 Arranya plans to hand over maximum seeds to the warkaris going on a pilgrimage to   so that they can sow them on the route. 
 
 “We are recycling seeds collected from urban forest areas. We have collected 25,000 seeds,” said Raj Madankar, founder of Arranya.
 
 Arranya’s seed collection movement started in 2011 with the launch of a seed bank. It has collected approximately 1.2 lakh seeds so far. 
 
 Madankar said these seeds have been collected from bioparks at Ambazari, Seminary Hills, Maharajbagh and campuses of VNIT, GMCH, Neeri and other places.
 
 The NGO members have also sowed seeds in the forest of Dava on  . “The success ratio of the planation is 15-25% only,” says Pratharna Paonikar, one of the coordinators.
 
 From this year, the NGO will also hand over seeds to social forestry department (SFD) and   ( ) nurseries where they will grow saplings and get them ready for plantation in two years.
 
 “We are planning to create women self-help group (SHG) and provide soil, compost, packets and seeds to the SHG. The women will nurse these saplings for which they will be paid remuneration. This will also help to generate employment,” said Madankar. 
 
 The forest department has already made an appeal to NGOs and individuals to join the 50 crore plantation drive to be taken up till 2019.
 
 The NGO also plans to collect more ayurvedic and medicinal plants seeds, rare species and seeds of fruit bearing plants. This will help protect biodiversity and maintain healthy environment.
