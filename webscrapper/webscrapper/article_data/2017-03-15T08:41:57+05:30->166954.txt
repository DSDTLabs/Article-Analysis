BENGALURU:   legislative assembly speaker K B   has proposed   system to improve attendance and increase participation of MLAs in the legislature session.

 Koliwad told reporters on Tuesday that the proposal will be sent to the government and a decision will be taken based on the quantum of financial allocation. At present, attendance in the legislative assembly is tabulated manually. However, some changes have been made with regard to attendance in the budget session to be commenced from Wednesday.
 
 “There have been complaints about legislators coming to the assembly hall at their own time, sign the register and disappear from   to attend other work. This has to change as they are supposed to take part in the legislature proceedings. From now, attendance will be marked an hour after the start of the assembly proceedings and the attendance register will be later taken away to the Speaker's chamber. The members will not be allowed to sign the register after that,“ Koliwad said. A member gets Rs 2,000 per day as sitting allowance during the legislature session.
