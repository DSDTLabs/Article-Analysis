 Severe shortage of electricity with MSEDCL has led to emergency load shedding across the state from Thursday. The situation was somewhat manageable on Friday, but on Saturday it was extremely bad for various parts of the state, an MSEDCL insiders said.
 
 “On Saturday, the gap between demand and supply led to increase in the duration of load shedding in some areas. Moreover there was a planned outage of power in many parts,” a senior officer form the MSEDCL said.
 
 Some of the prominent localities to face load shedding included Dwarka, Old City, Satpur, Ambad, Deolali Gaon, rural Nashik Road, Harsul and Trimbakeshwar.
 
 “In some other parts of the city there was planned power outage on Saturday. However, there are no plans to undertake planned outage of power on Sunday,” the official said.
 
 The sudden decision to resort to load shedding has irked the consumers. “The move to resort to load shedding is not accepted as the MSEDCL should have gauged the situation and planned accordingly. We wonder why the situation has become so critical after about three years of no load shedding,”  , a resident of Pathardi, said.
 
 Energy activists have termed this load shedding as illegal. “The consumers are already paying Rs 3,000 crore to MSEDCL as per the energy regulator (Maharashtra Energy Regulatory Commission – MERC) every year, considering that it has already made agreement of additional 6,500 MW for future under multi-year-tariff. If the current shortage of power is 9,000 MW daily as claimed, then why should consumers pay the sum to the power utility?” Pratap Hogade of Maharashtra Veej Grahak Sanghatana asked.
