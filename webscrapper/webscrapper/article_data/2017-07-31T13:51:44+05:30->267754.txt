COIMBATORE: Coming down heavily on actor  , actress Gayathri Raguram and Vijay television for telecasting reality show   with a word “cheri behaviour” (behaviour of people living in slums), Puthiya Tamizhagam Party founder president Dr K Krishnasamy on Sunday said he had sent legal notices to all the three parties and would seek Rs 100 crore as damage if they failed to tender an unconditional apology. Gayathri Raguram had in the show referred to another actor saying the latter’s was a cheri behaviour.

 Speaking to reporters here, he said the television channel and the actors have hurt the sentiments of the people residing in the slums. “Gayathri used the word “cheri behaviour” and the reality show was telecast without editing/muting it. The anchor of the show also did not take note of the word. So, I requested them to tender an unconditional apology two weeks ago. But there is no response from them,” he said.
 
 As there was no response from the parties involved, Krishnasamy has served them legal notices through his lawyers and sought Rs 100 crore as damages if the actors and television channel failed to tender apology within a week. He said the legal notices were served to the CEO, managing director and general manager of the television channel.
 
 Krishnasamy also welcomed the gesture of the late APJ Abdul Kalam’s grandnephew who placed the Bible and Quran next to the Bhagavad Gita near the statue of the former Indian president (Kalam) at   in Rameswaram. “Thirukkural and other valuable books can be placed near the statue of the Abdul  ,” he said.
