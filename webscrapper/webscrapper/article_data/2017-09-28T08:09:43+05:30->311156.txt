AHMEDABAD: On March 2013, amid protests, a resolution was passed by the board of trustees of   — which has a majority of   — allowing the 1,155-bed VS Hospital to turn into a 120-bed hospital, through the formation of a new   (MET). 

 The AMC-MET was set up to run self-financed medical courses on the campus. The remaining beds and a sizeable number of hospital staff were transferred to the AMC-MET trust. Strangely, in a recent submission before the charity commissioner, the AMC now claims that VS hospital has 400 beds and not 120.
 
 On July 19, deputy municipal commissioner Dr Harshit Gosavi, in an affidavit, said: “After thorough assessment and considering a number of factors, including the present requirements of the hospital it is understood that VS Hospital has 400 beds.” The new claim has been contested by the trustees, who have questioned how the AMC’s elected wing could run the hospital at their whims.
 
 Strangely, Dr Gosavi’s affidavit comes after the VS Hospital board presented four annual budgets, since 2013, claiming that the old VS hospital has just 120 beds. For some time now, the hospital’s trustees have been pointing to several irregularities related to illegal cadaver sales, medical equipment irregularities and the privatising of billing counters which led to a fake bill scam worth lakhs and has finally seen an FIR been registered.
 
 “These scams actually shows how AMC is desperate to get VS Hospital out of the board’s control and squander away taxpayer money. Such corruption comes in a hospital for which Sardar Patel spent years convincing the Mahajans to donate, as it was his dream for the city,” says a senior trustee of the hospital. The hospital was established by   in 1931 with a seed capital of Rs 4 lakh.
