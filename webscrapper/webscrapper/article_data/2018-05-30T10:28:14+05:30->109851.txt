LUDHIANA: The police arrested two drug peddlers after a kilogram of   was recovered from their possession in New Moti Nagar on Monday. 

 Ludhiana Special Task Force in-charge sub-inspector Harbans Singh said, “An SUV was stopped at a checkpoint at Malhotra chowk in New Moti Nagar. After a kilogram of heroin was found hidden under a seat, the SUV occupants — Kapil Dev, 35, a resident of SBS Nagar, Gill, and Hardeep Kumar Deepak, also 35, of Indira Puri — were arrested.” 
 
 Kapil told the police that he worked as a driver and took to drugs two years ago. “Kapil started peddling drugs with his friend, Hardeep, to fund his addiction. Hardeep runs an eating joint in Sundar Nagar and started doing drugs five years ago. About six drug peddling cases are registered against Hardeep in various police stations,” said a cop. 
 
 The duo bought the consignment from a Nigerian in Delhi to sell it to their clients in neighbouring villages of Ludhiana. 
 
 Police said days ago, they had arrested a drug peddler,   Singh, with two kilograms of heroin in Basti Jodhewal. During questioning, Shamsher had named Hardeep as his accomplice. Hardeep was declared a proclaimed offender in that case.
