CHENNAI:   wants to change the net-metering policy for domestic solar rooftops which will make it commercially unviable for consumers.

 According to the discom’s chairman and managing director  , “the scheme makes losses which will have to be borne by general public and not the affluent house owners who can afford the rooftop plants”. 
 
 However, calculations show that the units turn profitable over a period of 10 years going by the discom’s own figures.
 
 Currently, the installed capacity for around 4,732 rooftop solar plants under net-metering is 16MW. This translates into 2.56 crore units of electricity per year, which costs Rs 15 crore per year at a tariff of Rs 6 per unit. Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses for rooftop plants is less than 1% as power is consumed at the point of generation.
 
 If Tangedco is to supply the same quantity of power, it has to account for 25% T&D losses. For supplying 2.56 crore units the cost for the discom — excluding operation and maintenance costs which increase every year and huge capital expenditure on future transmission lines — is Rs 11 crore per year at the Average Power Purchase Cost (APPC) at Rs 3.35 per unit. APPC is the average price at which Tangedco buys or produces power from all sources put together. It was Rs 2.37 per unit in 2009-10 and Rs 3.35 in 2015-16, a 40% increase. By that metric, APPC will be Rs 4.69 per unit in 2021-22. At that rate, Tangedco will have to spend Rs 15 crore to replace the power that solar rooftop owners are producing, which is the break-even point.
 
 Also the so-called losses from rooftop panels that Tangedco claims is peanuts compared to its own T&D and power theft losses. RTI replies show that Tangedco lost Rs 7,086 crore to T&D in 2014-15 and Rs 43.2 crore to theft in 2015.
 
 Sunday is the last day for stakeholders to send in comments on Tangedco’s proposal to Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (tnerc@nic.in, TNERC) (MP 9 of 2017). However, the petition is not hosted on   website. It can be accessed on http://www.tangedco.gov.in/linkpdf/MP(120617).pdf
