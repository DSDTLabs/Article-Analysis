PATNA: Come June, wildlife enthusiasts can enjoy an hourlong pleasure ride on a 24-seat boat in the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary at Bhagalpur, the country’s only Gangetic dolphin sanctuary.

 The   will be part of the eco-tourism facilities to be launched by state environment and forest department. The boat will ply on the 65-km stretch of the sanctuary from Sultanganj to Kahalgaon.
 
 “The facilities will be launched hopefully from June. We will have several trial runs, and start operating the boat in full swing by October. Each trip will be of an hour or so and the service will be available from 8am and to 6pm,” Bhagalpur DFO S Sudhakar said on Tuesday, and added a guide would accompany the tourists and inform them about the flora and fauna and take them for eco-education and bird watching near the Jagatpur wetland.
 
 Depending on the demand, Sudhakar said, longer boat journeys will also be planned, especially for wildlife specialists and photographers. “We may procure 2-3 more boats in future,” he said.
 
 An announcement about the eco-tourism packages at the Vikramshila sanctuary was made by deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, who holds the environment and forest portfolio, on the Dolphin Day on October 5 last year in Patna.
 
 Recent reports say around 300 dolphins are found in the sanctuary. Apart from Gangetic dolphins, the sanctuary is a home to turtles, gharials, crocodiles and different species of fishes along with river and wetland birds. One of the world’s only three breeding sites of the endangered greater adjutant stork is near neighbouring Naugachhia.
