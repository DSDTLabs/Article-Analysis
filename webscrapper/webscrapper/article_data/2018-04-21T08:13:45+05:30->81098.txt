DALLI(JALANDHAR):   (KLF) chief Harminder Singh   was cremated at his native village Dalli, around 25km from Jalandhar. Besides his family and villagers, several leaders of radical groups were present on the occasion. 

 Mintoo's mortal remains were brought to the village on Thursday evening from Patiala and were kept in the village gurdwara. As the procession for his cremation started from the gurdwara to the cremation ground, pro-Khalistan slogans were also raised.
 
 His brothers Lakhwinder Singh and  , who lit the pyre, later said that they had strong suspicion about Mintoo's death in jail. They said it should be thoroughly investigated that why was he not taken to PGIMER, Chandigarh, in time despite the recommendations of the jail doctor.
 
 They said during their meetings with Mintoo, the latter had told them about the unavailability of medicines sometimes. "As our mother used to come with us to the jail, Mintoo would often not reveal his problems," they said.
 
 Prominent among those present during cremation included former Akal Takht chief Jasbir Singh Rode, Damdami Taksal chief Harnam Singh Dhumma, Sarbat Khalsa appointed   jathedar Amrik Singh Ajnala, Dal Khalsa president Harpal Singh Cheema, former militant leader Daljit Singh Bittu.
 
 Dhumma also demanded a high-level probe to bring out the truth on Mintoo's death. "Sikh political prisoners are not being released despite they had served their jail sentences and they were not being given medical facilities. It is clearly a case of discrimination against Sikh prisoners and undertrials," he said.
 
 Mintoo's family had shifted to Goa in late 1980s.
