RAIPUR: Jitesh Sharma must have been disappointed and frustrated after being left out of the   Ranji squad after just two innings. Sharma was given the opportunity to bat at No.4 and No.5 but he couldn’t make the opportunity count. 

 The 24-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman then watched his teammates lift the maiden   crown from sidelines. He would have loved to be part of that winning squad. However, Sharma kept himself in positive mindset, channelized his energy in the right direction and scored heavily wherever he got the opportunity.
 
 On Monday, Sharma showed why he has been an integral part of the Vidarbha One-day and Twenty20 teams for the last four years. Sharma was the first Vidarbha batsman to score hundred in Twenty20 and he almost scored his second in his comeback game against  .
 
 The aggressive opener blasted a 53-ball 91 (10x4, 3x6), while other batsmen played around him as Vidarbha posted a massive 195-7 in their opening game of the Central Zone Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 Trophy. Vidarbha bowlers then bowled with a lot of discipline and left it to Chhattisgarh batsmen to make the mistakes. The hosts kept on obliging them. By the 12th over, the game was well and truly over. They managed 147-8 in their 20 overs, handing Vidarbha a comfortable 48-run victory at Shaheed Veer Narayan Stadium in Raipur.
 
 It was Vidarbha’s first match after Ranji Trophy final and they played like champions. Faiz Fazal’s luck with the coin continued and he chose to bat. Sharma looked in great touch. The ball was racing away from his broad blade. He started off with a couple of crisp boundaries on the either side of the wicket to Vishal Kushwaha to get Vidarbha going.
 
 Skipper Faiz was happy to watch him from the other end. Sharma then launched Chhattisgarh spearhead Pankaj Rao over his head before timing the ball beautifully through on side for another boundary in the next over. Vidarbha had got the momentum and Chhattisgarh skipper Amandeep Khare had to bring left-arm spinner Sumit Ruikar inside the Powerplay.
 
 It hardly made any difference to Sharma as he lofted Ruikar over his head. With big boundaries, Sharma was placing the ball in the gaps for easy twos and threes. In between, he was getting regular boundary balls from Chhattisgarh bowlers. Sharma hit Ruikar for a huge six over long on which landed around 20 rows back.
 
 Another Chhattisgarh left-arm spinner Ajay Mandal was treated with equal disdain in the next over. The six off Manndal was even bigger and it brought his half-century in just 30 balls when Vidarbha’s score was 58. The departure of Faiz and Satish (17, 14b, 3x4) didn’t make any difference to him. Ravi Jangid (15, 10b, 1x4) and Apoorv Wankhede (15, 11b, 1x4) fed him enough strike. When Sharma was holed out at long on—after hitting two back to back boundaries—there were still 31 balls left.
 
 Chhattisgarh chipped in with quick wickets after that and it looked like they would restrict Vidarbha under 170. However, Karn Sharma (25, 13b, 3x4, 1x6) and Shrikant Wagh (13, 7b, 1x4) scored 30 in the last two overs to take score beyond Chhattisgarh’s reach.
 Wagh, later on, bowled a brilliant opening spell and accounted for openers Khare and Jatin Saxena. Rajneesh Gurbani then dismissed Abhimanyu Vhauhan with a brilliant outgoing delivery. Wicketkeeper Manoj Singh (35, 26b, 3x4, 1x6) and Ashutosh Singh (25, 28b, 1x4) kept Chhattisgarh in hunt for a brief period.
 
 Off spinner Akshay Wakhare’s tidy spell in the middle overs put more pressure on the middle orders. Chhattisgarh had lost the plot. Allrounder Akshay Karnewar struck on his first delivery to dismiss Singh. Shakeeb Ahmed (45, 23b, 5x4, 1x6) batted extremely well but needed more support from others. After 15th over, the game was going only one way. Vidarbha showed enough intensity to finish off the game in style.
