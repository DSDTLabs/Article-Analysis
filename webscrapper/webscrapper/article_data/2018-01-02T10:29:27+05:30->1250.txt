NEW DELHI: The entire state of Nagaland has been declared as “disturbed area” for six more months till the end of June under the controversial   (Afspa), which empowers security forces to conduct operations anywhere and arrest anyone without any prior notice.

 In a gazette notification, the Union home ministry said it is of the opinion that the area comprising the whole of Nagaland is in such a “disturbed and dangerous condition” that use of armed forces in aid of the civil power is necessary. “Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (No. 28 of 1958), the central government hereby declares that whole of the said state to be a 'disturbed area' for a period of six months with effect from December 30, 2017 for the purpose of that Act,” the notification said. A home ministry official said the decision to continue ascribing the status of a “disturbed area” to the state has been taken as a result of killings, loot and extortion have been going on in Nagaland. This has allegedly necessitated the declaration for the convenience of the security forces operating there. There have been demands from various organisations in the northeast, as well as in   and Kashmir, for repealing Afspa which, they say, gives “sweeping powers” to the security forces.
 
 The controversial act has been in force in Nagaland for several decades now. It has not been withdrawn even after a framework agreement was signed on August 3, 2015 by Naga insurgent group   general secretary   and the government's interlocutor R N   in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 The framework agreement came after over 80 rounds of negotiations spanning 18 years, with the first breakthrough made in 1997 when the ceasefire agreement was sealed after decades of insurgency in Nagaland.
