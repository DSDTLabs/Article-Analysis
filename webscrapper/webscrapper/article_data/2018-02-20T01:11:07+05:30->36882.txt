Go out and play,” Karia told her two-year-old daughter Vanitha when she asked for food. Her 5-month-old son Dhanush too is crying to be fed. Karia, 22, does not know how to handle the situation after she was told that her husband Jayaraj was found dead on Sunday.

 Jayaraj, 25, was among the five men whose bodies were found in a water body at Vontimitta in Andhra Pradesh.
 
 They were a happy couple. Jayaraj used to take his wife along whenever he went away from home for work. “This is the first time he has gone without me. I would have saved my husband if I was with him,” she told TOI.
 
 Karia developed breathing problems and chest pain after she gave birth to Dhanush. Doctors in Salem told her that she had a hole in the heart. They said she would need at least Rs 5 lakh for surgery.
 
 Since then, Jayaraj had been saving money to save his wife. When someone approached him for work in Andhra Pradesh, Jayaraj took it up without a moment’s hesitation. He told Karia that he would be back in a month with a good sum in hand.
 
 Karia is frightened. Now that there is no means for her surgery, she is wondering what would happen to her children if she does not live long.
 
 Her relatives are appealing to the state government to take care of Karia and her children.
