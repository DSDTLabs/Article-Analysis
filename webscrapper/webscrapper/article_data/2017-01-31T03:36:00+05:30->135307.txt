Panaji: Veteran tiatrist and independent candidate from Velim constituency Wilson ‘Wilmix’ Mazarello has promised to set up a Velim constituency counselling centre to facilitate various government schemes and impart guidance in education and career matters. He also spoke about a call centre for the old, which will help them with their documentation and any physical help required by them, free of cost.  “In the opinion of my voters, building bridges, widening and maintaining roads and lighting them is the work of the government, which it should do by default. What really makes the citizens happy are basic facilities such as a free and functioning health system and a strong academic facility doubled with job opportunities,” he said, addressing villagers at Lohia Chowk, in Assolna market area.
