GURUGRAM: A couple, accused of allegedly   a 17-year-old girl to   and sexually abusing her for more than two weeks, was arrested on Friday. 

 The girl had been rescued by the   (CWC) on Monday. According to CWC officials, cops at the women’s police station in Sector 51 delayed filing the FIR by a day, and also did not send the girl back to the shelter home on the intervening night of February 23 and February 24, as part of their investigation.
 
 The girl was allegedly trafficked by the couple, from Nathupur village in Gurgaon, around 20 days ago. She hailed from the same village in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district as the woman, whose husband had sexually abused the girl after bringing her to Gurgaon. The couple had also forced her to work as a maid to earn for them. She gradually opened up about her ordeal to a domestic help, who was working in the same home as her.
 
 “We were informed by the owner of the house, who got to know about the girl’s ordeal from another Bengali maid working there. We rescued her on Monday and kept her at a shelter home. She told us about the   on February 22. We approached police the same day. However, the FIR could only be filed the next day (February 23),” said Shakuntala Dhull, CWC chairperson. 
 
 She said initially, cops had not added relevant sections of the POSCO Act, which were added later.
 
 A medical examination has confirmed sexual abuse. The girl’s father, who came to Gurgaon from Bengal, also allegedly intimidated the girl before she was to appear before the magistrate, because of which she could not record her testimony there. She confided she was threatened by her father not to talk of sexual abuse, said CWC officials. “Cops were insensitive. The girl was not given a conducive environment to testify against the couple, as her father was present there,” said a CWC official.
