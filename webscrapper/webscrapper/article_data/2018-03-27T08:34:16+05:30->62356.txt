INDORE: In a bid to ensure   in areas with no Narmada water connections and where crisis has started,   has started supply of water   to meet the requirement. 

 Civic body officials said that they have started giving tankers to corporators to ensure adequate supply of water. It has 56 tankers and it has also roped in 40 private tankers this year to meet the demand. 
 
 “We have ample water stored in water bodies. We are hopeful that the tankers will be sufficient for supply of water in the entire city,” said IMC water works department in charge Balram Verma. 
 
 IMC has started   in the areas including, Niranjanpur, Nipania, Silicon City, Kanadia, Bicholi Mardana, Natya Mundla, Palda, Limbodi, Bilawali, Kailod Kartal, Hukmakhedi, Chhota Bangarda, Rewati, Bardari, Talawali Chanda and Bada Bangarda. 
 
 Verma said that private tankers will be roped in as per the requirement. “More tankers will be hired to supply water, if IMC will not be able to fulfil water requirements with the tankers it is having now,” he said. 
 
 Civic body officials said that they will also keep an eye on the private tankers and ensure that the water is supplied as per the demand. “Last year, we had installed CCTVs at some of the distribution points and if needed we will follow the same procedure this year too,” he said.
