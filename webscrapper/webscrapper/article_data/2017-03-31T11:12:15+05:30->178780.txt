BENGALURU:   Bangalore may have kick-started their pre-tournament training session under coach   but the question on everyone's mind was about India's and RCB's superstar skipper  , conspicuous by his absence on a blazing hot Thursday afternoon at the M Chinnaswamy stadium. How will the team fill the big shoes of the man with 4110 IPL runs (from 139 matches) should he miss a few of the early encounters?

 Kohli apart, the 10th edition of the   comes with challenges aplenty for all franchises. The country's national players are coming off a busy home season, which should account for a few aches and strains, while some South African and Englishmen will leave the country for international assignments before the completion of the League. Vettori, the former spin whiz, didn't give out much on Kohli's availability. "He will come in on April 2. Between now and then, the   doctors and physio will speak to us (on his condition) and our medical staff will get a clearer picture. Right now, we don't have a clear picture on his availability. We'll know in the next few days," said the New Zealander.
 
 On who would captain the side if Kohli was unavailable, Vettori said, "The likely scenario is that AB de Villiers will take over the duties but we'll answer that once we find out if Virat is out."
 
 
 
 
 With T20 specialist   joining the franchisee along with other foreign players like   and  , there is a lot of buzz around the left-arm pacer from England.
 
 Speaking about what the bowler brings to the table, Vettori said, "This is an incredibly important tournament for Tymal and RCB and we can utilize him as strongly as we need to. I've known him from Brisbane Heat, got a good feel for him as a person and a player. He'll fit in really well with our group. We don't want to put pressure on him (replacing  ). Starc is top-class bowler and Mills is only finding his way into international and franchise cricket now."
