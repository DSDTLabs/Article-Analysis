VADODARA: In the largest procurement of saplings ever,   (VMC) is eyeing to purchase three   for plantation in three zones of the city. The procurement is a part of the   Trees initiative.

 The VMC had proposed the massive plantation drive last year. Under the drive, the civic body proposes to plant one million trees in the city in the coming monsoon. 
 
 To ensure healthy growth and survival of the trees, the civic body plans to nurture them at tree banks that will come up across the city.
 
 The   has put up a proposal to procure three lakh saplings for plantation in North, West and South zones of the city. The civic body has proposed to spend Rs 30 lakh on the purchase of the saplings.
 
 VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao said the saplings were being procured in advance to ensure that they became of the height of a few feet in the tree banks before they were planted. “This increases their survival rate significantly. Against a survival rate of 50 per cent of very young saplings, the survival rate of those that are grown up is around 90 per cent. If nurtured locally, the saplings tends to acclimatize better and their survival rate may be even higher,” said Rao.
 
 The civic body has already identified around 270 spots in the city where afforestation will be conducted. These include plots as well as spaces around ponds in the city. 
 
 Various organizations in the city will also be roped in for the drive. Rao said the tree banks will come up at Kamatibaug, Nimeta and around some ponds in the city. He added that 10,000 trees were already being planted in the city at its entry points as a part of a public-private partnership initiative. Plantation has also been conducted at the now closed  .
