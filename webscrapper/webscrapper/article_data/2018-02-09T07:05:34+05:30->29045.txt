Kolkata: Power tariff in the state is likely to rise from April. The upward price revision of non-coking coal, main fuel used for power generation, by Coal India Ltd (CIL) last month has impacted the cost structure of power utilities.

 In January, immediately after the revision,   MD Aniruddha Basu had told TOI the company has not yet assessed the impact of the hike. CESC chairman Sanjiv Goenka said on Thursday it has impacted the cost of the company. The state-run power utilities, too, are experiencing the cost impact.
 
 As per rule, the power utilities can charge marginal variable cost adjustment ( ) even before getting a nod from the sector regulator based on tariff petitions if there is a rise in power generation cost induced by fuel price hike. CIL has divided coal into 17 grades and out of which, price of 10 went up and seven went down after the revision. There was a confusion among the power utilities about the net impact of the revision.
 
 A source in the   (WBERC) said, "The power distribution companies can recover the additional cost by charging marginal fuel cost adjustment (MFCA) while integrated power utilities like CESC can charge MVCA following hike in fuel cost. The MFCA and MVCA have to be discontinued after a formal tariff order, which may result in tariff hike or may even remain unchanged depending on the impact of fuel cost hike," said an official in WBERC.
