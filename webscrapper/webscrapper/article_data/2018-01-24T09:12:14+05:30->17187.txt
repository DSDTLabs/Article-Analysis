NAGPUR: The state government has waived off   to the tune of Rs 237.30 crore in the district and the process is still not over. Guardian minister   hopes to waive off loans of all applicants by March 31.

 The minister said that of the 53,139 applicants, 28,882 had taken loan from   ( ) while 24,257 were clients of nationalized banks.
 
 “So far 21,164 farmers having accounts in NDCCB have been given Rs 144 crore while 18,276 farmers having accounts in nationalized banks were given Rs 92 crore.

 Commenting on this, Bawankule said, “The reduction in DPC fund is to the tune of Rs 159 crore whereas farmers have received Rs 237 crore so far. The district has, therefore, got more funds.”
 
 The minister claimed that the loss of DPC fund would be less than Rs 159 crore. 
 
 “We have already allocated Rs 478 crore to various departments. I will urge finance minister   not to seek return of the extra money already allocated,” he said.
