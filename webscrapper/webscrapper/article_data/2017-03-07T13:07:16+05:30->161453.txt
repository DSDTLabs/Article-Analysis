MUMBAI: Several students have complained to   about delay in  , resulting in them reaching exam centres late. The issue caused a furore at Monday's committee meeting, where members pointed out that the "delays" were mainly due to new buses not having been inducted in the fleet. 

 Surprisingly, the BEST stands to lose Rs 100 crore - sanctioned by the BMC to purchase 185 ordinary buses and 10 electric buses - if the vehicles don't arrive by March 31. The funds will lapse, panel members pointed out. 
 
 Said MNS member Kedar Hombalkar, "Students have complained that there is a delay of 20-30 minutes in bus arrivals. The problem gets worse when in traffic snarls in the morning ."
 
 BEST general manager Jagdish Patil said that the administration would be taking stringent action against the manufacturer for the delays .
