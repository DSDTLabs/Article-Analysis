Trichy: Manika Batra’s historic gold medal win in the women’s singles table tennis final at the Commonwealth Games (CWG) 2018 should serve as an inspiration for every young woman to achieve in life, justice S Baskaran of the Madras high court said here on Sunday. He was delivering the graduation day address for undergraduate students, which was held on the premises of the Shrimati Indira Gandhi College. “So far, we have seen only players from Malaysia and Singapore dominate in table tennis but Batra has proved that if one pushes beyond the limits, then everything is possible,” Justice Baskaran said.  The judge added that the number of medals won by women at CWG 2018 at Gold Coast in Australia also proved the same point. Baskaran said that when it comes to career and education, youngsters should always make their own decision. “They can always get suggestion from others, but the final call should be theirs,” he said. He added that the graduating students must also become more flexible, so that even if they’re not able to achieve their primary goal, they could still work on suitable alternates. Baskaran also said that students must have a long-term vision just like that of the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. A total of 1,517 students – including 44 university rank holders – were conferred with their degrees during the event.
