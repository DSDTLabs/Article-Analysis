Celebrating Bangaliana in spirit and words, Times Baishakhi 1425, organized by The Times of India and Ei Samay at The Tollygunge Club on Sunday evening, redefined Poila Baisakh with some soulful music and adda.

 The event was a healthy mix of young and veteran performers. Actor Soumitra Chattopadhyay’s rendition of Jibonananda Das’s ‘Tomake Bhalobashi’ and Tagore’s ‘Nimantran’, former   CEO, researcher and public speaker Jawhar Sircar’s explanation of Nababarsho’s origin, some beautiful compositions by   and Soumyajit, held a full house captivated for over two hours.
 
 Sharing stage was US consul-general in Kolkata Craig Hall. His wife and Korean Soprano Meeryung Hall’s rendition of ‘Jodi Tor Dak Shun Keu Na Ashe’ and ‘Ami Chini Go Chini Tomare’ touched the right notes. Young singer Shayani Palit’s presentation of Begum Akhtar’s ‘Jochona Koreche Aari’, too, hit the right chord with the audience. A candid chat with designer Agnimitra Paul enlightened all on the origin of Bengali fashion. The evening concluded with ‘Dhono Dhanney Pushpe Bhora’.
