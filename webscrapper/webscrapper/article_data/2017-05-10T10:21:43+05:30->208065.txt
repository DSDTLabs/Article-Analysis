HYDERABAD: After four women were hit by sudden complications and sepsis post deliveries, family members have been struggling to meet additional expenses. Left with no choice, they have been forced to spend huge sums of money to procure blood  ,  , among other requirements from outside the hospital.With all families from economically weaker sections of society , some have taken to borrowing money from acquaintances to meet   that do not seem to end. “Blood products are being procured and some investigations done from outside as they are not available at the Gandhi Hospital.Because I have to foot bills, I borrowed Rs 10,000 from friends to pay for the initial sepsis diagnosis test and other tests that were done subse quently ,“ said a family member of one woman.

 “It is quite an irony. While these poor patients come from far of to government hospitals in the hope that they will get free treatment, they end up not just losing their lives but also their hard-earned money because of the negligent attitude of these hospitals. Most of these people have borrowed money from relatives and financiers. The government should at least provide some assistance to these hapless souls,“ said   a member of the NGO working at the hospital.
