A connecting terrace on three high-rise wings is an excellent idea, but there is nothing in the development control rules (DCR) to allow such constructions at present, said municipal commissioner  . “Necessary changes can be made in the draft DCR (2034) to allow merit architectural features.“

 The revision cell preparing the new DC rules did not include these features because of the fear that allowing terrace connectivity having large width may obstruct light and ventilation of the flats below.
 
 The   has now decided that terraces can be connected provided measures are taken for light and ventilation, structural and fire safety. “Architects will have to submit complete details about steps taken for safety measures, details about ensuring light and ventilation in writing while putting up such proposals," said the new policy.
 
 The BMC has prohibited any structure on the terrace which can be misused. “This area shall be kept vacant and maintained open to sky and not be allowed for any purpose. The chief fire officer will have to give a no-objection certificate before plans are approved," it said.
