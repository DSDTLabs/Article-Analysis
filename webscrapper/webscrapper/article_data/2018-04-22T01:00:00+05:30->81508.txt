Summer is here and how. And it has brought with it, a range of seasonal   trends. Easy-to-wear, flowy fabrics in light colours are popular not just as casual wear but also great for breezy summer brunches, evening soirees and wedding parties. Designers and stylists share tips about four summer must-haves…

 
 
 Light, flowy fabrics rule this season. Pick from tulle, lace, light cottons, linen and georgettes to nail the elegant summer look. These are versatile fabrics and when styled correctly can give you a chic look.
 
 
 
 Choose sorbet tones of peach, canary yellows, minty melons, shades of mustard, calico blues, indigos and reds. Of course, a few striking white tops or dresses are a summer essential — you cannot go without them!
 
 
 
 Yes, this can add oodles of oomph to your simple ensembles. Wear it with a skirt, a pair of straight linen pants or even with a sari.
 
 
 
 These are a rage during summer. Mix-and-match to flaunt your summer-ready style. Bring your   quotient to the forefront with tropical prints like unconventional fruits and striking bold summer blossoms or leaf prints.
