Colva: NCP’s Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao, in all probabilty, won’t oppose the BJP-led coalition government during the floor test of the new government in the Goa assembly on Thursday, his supporters suggested.

 Elvis Gomes, former personal assistant of former MLA Caetano ‘Caitu’ Silva, who is now the convener of NCP Benaulim workers, addressed reporters, along with sarpanchas and panch members of Salcete’s coastal villages. He said the elected representatives of Salcete’s village panchayat’s have urged Alemao to support BJP. “We fought the elections against BJP and were all out to form a non-BJP government, but if Congress could not attain the numbers, is it Churchill’s fault?” Elvis questioned.
 
 Gomes claimed that the Congress treated Alemao very badly, even as the Benaulim MLA tried to rope in a couple of independents to support Congress to form the government in Goa, immediately after the counting.
 
 At a public meeting in Benaulim on Jan 30, Alemao had vouched not to support the BJP, even if his supporters advised him, but the supporters said he should support BJP “for development sake”. tnn
