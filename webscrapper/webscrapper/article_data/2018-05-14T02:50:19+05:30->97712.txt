NAVI MUMBAI: The   removal work of two holding ponds in   has been held up for around five years as   is yet to receive   ( ) permission. 

 The holding ponds in sectors 7 and 21 have not been cleaned since they became operationalised around 25 years ago. The holding ponds are crucial in saving the nodes from flooding due to heavy rains.
 
 The Dutch dyke system based holding ponds hold sewerage water flowing to it. During high tide, the dyke gets automatically closed, not allowing sea water to flow into the pond. During low tide the dyke opens, allowing the sewage water from the holding pond to flow into the creek.
 
 However, mangroves have been grown near the holding ponds. As per rule the mangroves area fall under the jurisprudence of MCZMA and Cidco is yet to obtain the former’s permission.
 
 Cidco assistant executive engineer   said, “The two holding ponds located in Kalamboli needs to cleaned to increase its capacity. We have been following up with the MCZMA to permit us to conduct the sludge removal work for the last five years.”
 
 Reportedly, MCZMA is having staff crunch and also laid down several conditions for obtaining permission.
