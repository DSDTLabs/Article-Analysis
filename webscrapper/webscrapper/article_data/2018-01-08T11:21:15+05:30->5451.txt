NAGPUR: As part of the ‘Clean Forest Mission’, a group of students and like-minded youths, on Sunday cleaned the reserve forest near Ambazari Khadan in   forest range. The area falls in the buffer zone of   Tiger Reserve.

 Saurabh  , a BSc II year zoology student who formed the group, said he has been volunteering to clean forest areas of plastic and waste harmful for wildlife for the last one year.
 
 On Sunday, Sukhdeve, Shirish Nakhle, Rozal Raut and   cleaned the reserve forest area near Ambazari Khadan (mine) of beer cans, plastic bottles and wrappers, pouches and other waste material. They also found used condoms in the forest area.
 
 Hingna range forest officer (RFO) Ashish Ninawe supported the drive by providing a vehicle to remove the waste. The spot is isolated and 30km from Nagpur. Being part of the corridor there is always wild animal movement. According to Sukhdeve, most of the visitors include students, young couples and even families. 
 
 “The abandoned mine has turned into a water body and wild animals frequent the area to quench thirst. The waste dumped by people may prove to be dangerous for the animals,” said Sukhdeve.
 
 Similar activities are going on in   forest under Hingna range which also falls in the buffer zone. Many youths frequent the area but of the late patrolling by foresters seem to be proving a deterrent.
