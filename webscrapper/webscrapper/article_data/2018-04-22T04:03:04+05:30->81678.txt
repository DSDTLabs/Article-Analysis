MUMBAI: A sea-facing ground-plus-one hotel that had come up illegally in   over 2,000 sqft in 2007 was brought down by the   with help from police officials on Saturday. The first floor of Cafe Seaface was spread over 1,500 sqft.

 A civic official said that the hotel was located right at the beginning of Bandra Worli Sea Link. The BMC had served the eatery a notice for illegal construction soon after it came up but the matter went to the court and no action could be taken, added an official.
 
 The demolition comes in the wake of the court stay being vacated and a ruling in the BMCâ€™s favour. Assistant commisioner (G south ward)   said that there was resistance during demolition which took place over the last three days and hence, they sought police assistance.
