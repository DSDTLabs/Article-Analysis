NEW DELHI:   handlers of the Delhi   and Gurgaon Police got into a spat with each other after incessant rain led to snarls on NH-48.

 A commuter had tagged both Delhi and Gurgaon Police in a tweet over the   snarls. In response, Delhi Traffic Police’s twitter handle advised him to inform the Gurgaon Police as the location which the commuter had mentioned was not in their jurisdiction.
 
 However, Gurgaon Police’s twitter handle retorted that their Delhi counterparts must clear snarls on the Rajokri flyover as traffic had tailed back to Gurgaon leading to the snarls. The spat was resolved when Delhi Traffic Police deployed its men to clear the gridlock.
 
 The morning shower led to traffic snarls on the NH-8 and commuters took to social media and asked both Delhi Traffic Police and the Gurgaon Police to clear the snarls.
 
 However, one such tweet by a commuter named Birender Kumar Singh tagging the DTP and the Gurgaon Police led the Delhi Police to ask the complainant to report the matter to their Gurgaon counterparts as the area was beyond their jurisdiction. Within a few second, the Gurgaon police asked the Delhi Traffic Police to remove the snarls on the Rajokri flyover as the tailback was affecting traffic in Gurgaon.
 
 Delhi Police reacted to the tweet by saying that additional personnel had already been deployed to control the mess.
 
 Twitteratti, however, took it up as squabble between the two police forces. Some of them blamed the police authorities for being unable to come to terms over the jurisdiction of a highway.
