NEW DELHI: he 27th meeting of the   on Thursday will consider a number of issues which have been in the pipeline for some time now. The Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley-chaired council, comprising state finance ministers, will meet through video conferencing.

 The meeting comes at a time when Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections achieved its record high by exceeding Rs 1 lakh crore milestone in April.
 
 Here are five major issues that will be on the Council's agenda:
 
 
 
  It has been hanging fire for a long time and a Group of Ministers (GoM) under Bihar deputy CM   could not get revenue officers and Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani, who is being consulted on the issue, to agree to a simplified form. Now, the GST Council will decide on the “fusion model” proposed by Sushil Modi
 
 
 
  If the proposal, which has been on the table since November goes through, payment by credit card will fetch you a discount on the GST liability, which may be to the tune of two percentage points
 
 
 
  The Centre and the states will decide if GSTN, the company that runs the IT platform, needs to be turned into a 100% government-owned company at a time when there is debate over data security. Currently, HDFC, ICICI Bank and LIC Housing Finance are majority owners.
 
 
 
  The anti-evasion tool is meant to keep tabs on sale by businesses, which have a turnover of less than Rs20 lakh and do not need to register for GST.
 
 
  A contentious issue, given that the idea was to do away with cesses and surcharges after the new regime kicked in. The ill-conceived plan has been
 proposed by the food ministry.
