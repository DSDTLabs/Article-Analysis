MUMBAI: Had   (relief and rehabilitation) Medha Gadgil, the   in  , been picked for the job on Monday, she would have made history as the state’s first woman chief secretary.

 States such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have had or have women chief secretaries. Even a state like Haryana, not known to be girlchild-friendly, got a woman chief secretary in 2005 when Meenaxi Chaudhary was appointed to the post.
 
 While Gadgil’s husband Congress MLC Anant Gadgil’s political affiliation is being termed as the reason for her losing the top job, she is not the first woman IAS officer to be passed over. In the past Chitkala Zutshi and Chandra Iyengar, who were additional chief secretaries and handled the home portfolio, were not picked.
 
 Ex-IPS officer Meera Borwankar, who quit the cadre after she was denied the post of Mumbai police commissioner said, “Medha was principal secretary (home) in charge of prisons when I was additional DGP (prisons). We jointly handled the sensitive Ajmal Kasab hanging. It was only because of her backing that we could set up five open prisons across the state. I found her highly professional and compassionate. It is unfortunate she has been overlooked.” Sources said women IAS officers had for the last three weeks been seeking an appointment with CM Devendra Fadnavis to push Gadgil’s case but did not get an appointment. Even Gadgil did not get an appointment with the CM.
 
 Alleging bias, a bureaucrat said, “When a woman officer takes leave because her child is sick, she is seen as making excuses. When a man takes leave for a similar reason, he is considered noble.” NCP MLC Viday Chavan said it was injustice to women and to Gadgil. Fadnavis did not respond to TOI’s message.
