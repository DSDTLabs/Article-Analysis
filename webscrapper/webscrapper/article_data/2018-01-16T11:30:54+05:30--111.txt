NEW DELHI:   on Tuesday named   as replacement for wicketkeeper   who injured himself during a training session last week ahead of the second Test against South Africa.

 
 Saha missed out the ongoing Test in Centurion after hurting his hamstring and was replaced by Parthiv Patel in the playing XI. His failure to regain fitness ahead of the third and final Test means he has been ruled out of the rest of the series and will be replaced by Karthik who last played a Test for India back in 2010.
 
  "The All-India Senior Selection Committee has named Dinesh Karthik as the replacement for Wriddhiman Saha for the third and final Test against South Africa. He is set to join the team before the third Test," the BCCI said in a media release. 
 
 Saha broke former Test captain MS Dhoni's record of most dismissals by an Indian wicketkeeper in a Test when he claimed 10 catches in the series opener in Cape Town. However, he failed to make impact with the bat registering a duck in the first innings and managing just 8 from the second as India lost by 72 runs. 
 
 "Mr. Wriddhiman Saha suffered an upper left hamstring tendon injury during training on Thursday, January 11. The BCCI Medical Team will continue to monitor his progress," the release further added.
 
 Karthik's last appearance in Test whites was against Bangladesh at Chittagong in 2010. He has so far played in 23 Tests since making his debut in 2004 and scored 1000 runs including a century and seven fifties. The third Test starts from January 24.
