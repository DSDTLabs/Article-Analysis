Vadodara: Owner of properties in the old city area that were razed since June 2016 by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) held demonstrations again at the civic bodyâ€™s headquarters at Khanderao Market on Saturday.

 The owners whose properties were razed on the Adaniya Pul to Thekarnath crematorium road, Harankhana Road in Wadi in June 2016 and November 2016 have been demanding adequate compensation from the civic body. The owners were earlier offered the option of taking the compensation in cash and had exercised it.
 
 The VMC at a later stage started dragging its feet on giving the compensation in cash. It is now of an opinion that any compensation should be given only in the form of transferable development rights. In a memorandum submitted to the civic body on Saturday, those who lost their properties have stated that this was breach of trust by the civic body. They have threatened to intensify the agitation in the coming days.
