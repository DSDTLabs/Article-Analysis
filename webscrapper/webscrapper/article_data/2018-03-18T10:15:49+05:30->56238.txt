THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   is all set to get its official fruit next week and it is none other than jackfruit, which is known for its distinctive taste and aroma. State government will make an official declaration in this regard on March 21, based on a proposal submitted by agriculture department. While elephant is the state animal, great hornbill,   and pearl spot are the official bird, flower and fish respectively. 

 The government plans to promote 'Kerala jackfruit' as a brand in markets across the country and abroad, highlighting its organic and nutritional qualities. Agriculture minister VS   said the core objective was to give a fillip to production and sale of jackfruit and its value-added products.
 
 "After branding, we expect a total revenue of Rs 15,000 crore through the sale of jackfruit and its allied products. We are planning the declaration on March 21. Though it is one of the most-widely produced fruits, we are yet to tap its potential completely. Crores of jackfruits (different varieties) are produced here every year," he said, adding that the fruit is very organic as it is produced without using chemical fertilizers or pesticides.
 
 After the official declaration, the demand for jackfruit and allied products are expected to go up and more people are expected to foray into cultivation, said the minister. The government plans to distribute maximum jackfruit tree saplings among the public to grow it in their backyards and thus expand fruit cultivation.
 
 A research centre has already been opened at Ambalavayal, under the aegis of agri department, to carry out studies and tap the fruit's potential. The government also conducts jackfruit fest every year to popularize the fruit and its products, he added. Agencies
