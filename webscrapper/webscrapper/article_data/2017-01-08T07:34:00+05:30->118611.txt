CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal on Saturday accused the Congress and   (AAP) of influencing the   on its decision to put curbs on distribution of atta daal under government’s flagship till February 4 polls.

 “The move by these two parties is an ominous proof of what Punjab would have to face in the most unlikely event of the Congress or AAP being in charge of the state’s government. This is a foretaste of what they have in mind for Punjabis, in case they ever get a chance to form a government here,” said Akali Dal in a statement after its core committee’s meeting.
 
 The EC has so far not issued any formal instructions to the SAD government on its decision.
 
 “The same Congress party had got the distribution of atta daal stopped during the last assembly elections in Punjab in 2012. The SAD BJP government had contested that order also,” the statement read.
 
 Earlier, SAD supremo Sukhbir Badal announced the candidature of the first Sikh Army chief Gen J J Singh (retd) as the party’s candidate from   assembly constituency against   chief  . Earlier, in the day, Gen Singh had officially join the Akali Dal in Sukhbir’s presence.
