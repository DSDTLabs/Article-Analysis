Panaji: The   on Friday morning filed an additional reply before the sessions and district court with a statement of the leaseholder of the controversial iron ore mine alleging that Imran khan had taken power of attorney from her by paying cash. 

 The police tried to make their case by submitting the statement of Maria Figuereido, a legal heir of Amalia Figuereido, the original lease holder. Maria stated that she was not involved in mining at TC no 65/51 or any other lease area.
 
 Maria said that in 2007-2008, Khan took her signatures on power of attorney with regards to TC 65/51 and paid her some cash too. She was shocked and surprised that Khan had exploited their property for his personal gain, the police claimed.
 
 Speaking to reporters after the court hearing, defence counsel Nitin Sardesai said Maria Figuereido was willing to despose in the court that she had given her statement to the SIT “under duress”. TNN
