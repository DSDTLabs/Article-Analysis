Ranchi: Several complaints of the Ranchi Municipal Corporation elections’ campaign loudspeakers of various candidates being played over permissible decibel limit reached sub-divisional officer Anjali Yadav following which she has formed a committee to keep a check on such violations on Sunday.

 This particular way of campaigning has become a headache for the people in residential areas. The campaign vehicles of various candidates start moving around across the city from 7am and continue till late evening. 
 
 “The loudspeakers are so loud that we are neither able to sleep or even talk among each other if the campaign vehicle is anywhere near our house. These vehicles do not come just once or twice. Vehicle of every candidate comes around at least 10 times a day,” said Mamta Devi, a resident of L N Mishra Colony in ward 33.
 
 Similarly, residents of Madhukam, ward 34 are facing problems. “Our children are unable to study in the evening because of these loudspeakers,” said Priya Gupta, a resident.
 
 She added, “A committee including members of Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board has been formed and they have already identified five such cases in which loudspeakers were played over the permissible limit. A report in the case will be submitted on Monday following which FIR will be lodged against the candidates for violation of code of conduct.”
 
 According to the law, 55dB is the permissible limit for residential areas while 65dB for commercial areas. 
 
 The four-member team constitutes of research assistant of JSPCB Subodh Kumar Singh, technical assistant Shrikant Tiwari, circle officer Ramji Prasad Gupta and junior engineer Abhishek Anand Gupta. 
 
 Yadav said, “The team will conduct daily drive to keep a check on   till the campaigning is over.”
