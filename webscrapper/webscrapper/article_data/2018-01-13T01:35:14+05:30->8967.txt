NEW DELHI: Urban development minister   on Friday directed the mayors of the three municipal corporations to clear the way for the notification of 351 city roads for mixed land use within 10 days. 

 The notification can protect the traders on these roads from the sealing drive being carried out by the corporations on the order of the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee. 
 
 Jain said, “The notification could not be done because the civic bodies have not given any satisfactory response to the questions raised by the department. I asked the mayors to complete it within two days, but they sought 10 days.” 
 
 A Delhi government official said that following a   directive, the government would need its approval before converting these roads into mixed land use stretches. “We will seek the court’s approval after the civic bodies submit their response,” Jain said.
 
 The corporations will have to submit a report on the authenticity of the survey conducted by them, a separate list of the roads and assurance for compliance of the provisions of Master Plan 2021, and existing and proposed parking facilities.
 
 South corporation mayor  , who participated in the meeting, said the delay was caused by the department itself. “The civic body had approved a list of roads in 2007 and sent it to the government. It then asked for more details, which were sent in May 2016. Since then, no communication has been received from the government,” Sehrawat said.
