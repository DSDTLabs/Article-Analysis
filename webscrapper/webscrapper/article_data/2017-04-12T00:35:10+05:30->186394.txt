Mumbai: The   ( ) on Tuesday moved an application before the special Prevention of   Act (PMLA) court seeking the issuance of a non-bailable   against controversial Islamic preacher  .

 Naik’s confidant, Aamir Gazdar was earlier arrested in a money laundering case connected to Naik’s Islamic Research Foundation (IRF). 
 
 The application, moved through ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar, will come up for hearing on Wednesday. ED sources said Naiks personal appearance was paramount and the investigation could not be conducted as per his convenience. 
 
 They said his non-appearance despite repeated summons was a hindrance to the investigation. 
 
 The ED stated that Naik had not cooperated with the investigation and his absence had further delayed it. It claimed that Naik controlled all affairs of his trust as well as companies and his presence was required to retrieve information that were exclusively known to him. 
 
 It said Naik had interests in countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia and owned several properties there.
 
 Earlier, Naik’s lawyer had moved a plea before the court, requesting his side be heard in case the ED moved an application against him. The two-page application filed then through advocate Tarraq Sayyed, stated that during Gazdar’s remand hearing, the investigating agency had shown Naik as a person who had been avoiding taking part in the investigations. 
 
 The lawyer said certain media reports and statements made by ED officials or by people on their behalf had said that steps were being taken to declare Naik an absconder and that there was a possibility of approaching the court for issuance of a warrant. The plea stated that material facts with respect to Naik had been suppressed before the court and there were fears that the investigating agency would misguide the court and obtain coercive penalizing orders behind his back.
