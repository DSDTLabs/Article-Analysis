VADODARA: Police officials in the city will now have to be on their toes till late in the night. City police commissioner, Manoj   has issued a circular asking cops from the level of police sub-inspectors to deputy commissioner of police (DCP) to be present in their area till 1 am. Sashidhar has also warned of punishment if the cops don’t follow his order. 

 When asked about the reason behind issuing such circular, Sashidhar said that it is important to patrol till late in night to maintain law and order. 
 
 “We had discussed this issue some days ago. In winters, people usually sleep early but in summers many of them are on out on roads. So, it is necessary to monitor all the areas in night,” Sashidhar told TOI 
 
 “The cops posted in   are already following this system. But now those posted in all other areas will have to be in their respective jurisdictions till late and monitor the situation. They will be patrolling their areas,” Sashidhar said. 
 
 Every police station already has a staff that is dedicated to patrolling during nights. The circular states that if a PSI wants to leave before 1am, he or she will have to take permission of the joint police commissioner. Police inspectors and above ranking officers would have to seek permission of the police commissioner. 
 
 Sashidhar, however, said that this circular isn’t a fallout of the recent rioting during the Ram Navmi procession Fatehpura when there were reports of senior cops reaching late to the spot. When asked about such long duty hours affecting health of cops, the police commissioner said, “Those staying on duty till late in nights can come late in mornings. We do care for health of policemen but our duty hours are usually long.” 
 
 The city police have already implemented a system wherein patrolling teams have been assigned areas where they have to register their attendance through their mobile phones. The teams have to upload their photos on the system after visiting their patrolling points.
