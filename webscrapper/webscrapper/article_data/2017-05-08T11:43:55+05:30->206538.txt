AURANGABAD: Three teenagers, who went missing from Jogeshwari area on Friday, were fished out from a nearby percolation tank on Sunday. The trio had gone for swimming, but they drowned after getting stuck in the silt. 

 The incident came to light after passersby spotted a body floating in the percolation tank, following which the villagers, police and the fire brigade authorities were informed.
 
 The deceased,   (14),   (13) and   (13), were residents of Ranjangaon Shenpunji, which falls under the Gangapur tehsil in the district.
 
 The city police had launched a manhunt for tracking down three minors, after Rahul's mother   lodged a complaint on Saturday about the three teenagers not returning home.
 
 MIDC Waluj police inspector  , said, "Based on her complaint, we registered a case of kidnapping and started looking for them across the city."
 
 According to the primary investigation, the trio had first gone for swimming at the Jogeshwari pond, but a shepherd who was grazing a herd of goats, asked them to leave the spot.
 
 Police said that the teenagers decided to go to a nearby percolation tank for a swim. But, they were not aware of the high amount of silt, which became the reason for their death.
 
 Rahul was a ninth standard student, while the other two were in class seven.
 
 "After the bodies were fished out, they were sent for autopsy to the Government Medical College and Hospital," Jadhav said.
 
 Ruling out any foul play, the officer said that the primary report has concluded that the trio died of drowning as there were no physical or other injuries on the body of the deceased.
