Bengaluru: The Congress’ 44-member state election committee held its first meeting and got down to selecting probable candidates for 90 constituencies where the party had lost in 2013.

 At the day-long meeting at a resort near BIAL, the party also formed four committees for the four revenue divisions — Bengaluru, to be headed by the party’s campaign committee chairman D K Shivakumar, Mysuru by KPCC working president Dinesh Gundu Rao, Belagavi under former minister S R Patil and Kalaburagi to be headed by MP B K Hariprasad. According to party sources the committee shortlisted at least three candidates for each of the 90 constituencies.
 
 The meeting also informally discussed possible candidates in assembly segments where the party has not won for a long time. Much-talked about issues like ‘one familiy one ticket’ and ‘no ticket for tainted and those with criminal charges’ did not figure in the meeting. 
 
 The timing of the meeting is strategic, since it keeps the Rajya Sabha elections on March 23 in mind. Sources said the issue of handing out tickets to the 123 MLAs and the seven JD(S) rebels, who will join the Congress on March 25 in the presence of AICC president Rahul Gandhi — will be addressed on March 26 — well after the Rajya Sabha  .
 
 “We have discussed elaborately about 90 constituencies in today’s meeting,” said Shivakumar. “The meeting did not discuss about sitting MLAs and the seven rebel JD(S) MLAs who are willing to join the Congress. We will meet again on March 26 where probables for all the 224 segments will be finalized.”
 
 The candidates for all constituencies will be submitted to the screening committee of the AICC, headed by Madhusudan Mistry, in the first week of April. Along with the names, the KPCC will also send field reports and feedback from people on each candidate. The screening committee then send the final list to the party high command for the final go-ahead.
