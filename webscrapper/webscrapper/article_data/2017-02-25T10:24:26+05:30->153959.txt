BARWANI:Forest department team on Friday caught a leopard, which had allegedly killed some cattle and created panic among villagers in Dhalkheda of Khargone forest division. 

 “We have trapped a 20-month-old leopard, which is a suspect behind many attacks on livestock in the past two months, at morning near Dhalkheda village. Later, we released it in dense forests of Chandgarh ( ) in Khandwa district,” said MR Baghel, divisional forest officer (DFO), Khargone.
 
  Baghel said that due to Narmada river basin, the area had ample water and food for the animal which killed many cattle in past two months creating panic among the villagers of the area. 
 
 It was captured in camera trap, but the forest department team was not able to catch it despite many efforts. “We could have caught the leopard a little earlier by tranquillisation process but it could have harmed the animal so we chose the natural course,” said Baghel.
 
 Leopard is a clever animal and the day on which it does not get any food it can harm anyone, he added.
 
 It is the third leopard, which we have caught in the area in the last one year, said relieved Baghel adding that the population of leopards is increasing in the area which is good sign for ecosystem.
