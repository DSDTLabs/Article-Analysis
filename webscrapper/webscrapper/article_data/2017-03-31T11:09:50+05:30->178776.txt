I live in Haridwar, a city where the holy river Ganga is getting polluted with all sorts of waste. So I have grown up in a city and ambience at home where a lot of discussion takes place around the topic of environment. I can realize that the situation is getting bleak with a lot of deforestation in the name of development, reduction in funding for conservation-based projects and non-implementation of all the laws pertaining to environment. This makes me worried about the future for us children.
  
  
 
  Children and future generations have the right to a healthy environment. But they are also the most vulnerable to climate change and fell prey to diseases such as asthma, malaria or cholera. It is also mentioned in my petition that according to estimates of the  , children suffer more than 80% of the diseases attributed to climate change.
  
  
 
  They must come up with effective, scientific measures to ensure that children or future generations do not suffer the adverse impacts of climate destabilisation, rising temperature and pollution. First of all, air quality must be improved. We must know that it is carbon emissions which are contributing to increase in temperature. Governments need to do something concrete about it.
