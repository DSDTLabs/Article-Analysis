  The Drum Cafe band serenaded the crowds with some energetic music and both Kiku and Rannvijay actually joined the talented artistes on stage and joined in as they played the song. Talking about the event, Rannvijay said, "I have not seen such amazing vehicles ever. There is a spirit of adventure I have observed among the people gathered here today. I became a Roadie because I was a biker and I was chasing the same sense of adventures like the people here. I am now waiting for my daughter to grow up so that I can go riding bikes with her, and through her rediscover the same sense of adventure that I experienced."
  
  
  
 
 Kiku Sharda was also quite impressed with what was on display. He said, “While I am not from Mumbai, I have moved here and come to love the city. And to be seeing so many lovely vintage cars so early in the day excites me. I am a car-lover, so being here makes so much sense. It’s all quite interesting for me, and I can’t wait to check out more.”
