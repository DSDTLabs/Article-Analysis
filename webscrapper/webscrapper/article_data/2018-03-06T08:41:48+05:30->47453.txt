RANCHI: Residents will soon get the opportunity to book   through a mobile application, toll free number or website very soon. Private company Eco Gadi Taxi Services on Monday got the approval of   (RMC) to ply e-rickshaws in the city on individual bookings. 

 At present, hundreds of e-rickshaws ply on the city roads but are all available only on certain routes and on sharing basis. The Eco Gadi company received the clearance of RMC to ply their e-rickshaws anywhere across the city and not just on the limited routes.
 
 Eco Gadi proprietor Akshay Malpani said, "The e-rickshaws will not just make commuting easier but safer as well. Each of our e-rickshaws will have cameras and GPS installed in them which will send the photographs of the interior of the rickshaw to both the passenger and us after every 15 minutes thus ensuring that safety measures are maintained."
 
 Unlike the regular e-rickshaws, the e-rickshaws will be available for booking for 20 hours a day. "The e-rickshaws will ply from 3:30am to 11pm everyday. To ensure that women travel safely in these e-rickshaws we will have female drivers from 11am to 5pm, as well. All our drivers will be well trained and will have a proper uniform and ID," Malpani said.
 
 The service is likely to be launched by the end of this month or the beginning of April. Malpani said, "Initially, we are launching 100 rickshaws. "
