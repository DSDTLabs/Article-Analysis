CHENNAI: Lack of maintenance of a multi-crore pedestrian over-bridge in   has commuters irked as it forces them to climb up non-functional escalators to cross a busy road. 

 The foot-over-bridge (FOB) near Anna Nagar (west) bus depot, was one of the first FOBs in the city to have escalators for use by commuters. It was opened for public use in June 2014 following inauguration by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa.
 
 P Sankar, a local resident, told TOI that the escalator operators are never present. “On rare occasions, I have spotted the escalator on one side of the bridge functioning. But it stops within few hours,” he said. This is in stark contrast to what was promised when the FOB was inaugurated. TOI reported in June 2014 that the state highways department had fitted the FOB’s escalator with automated sensors that turn it on/off based on pedestrian movement.
 
 On Thursday, TOI spotted a sweeper operating the escalator. “The contract for the maintenance ended and so nobody maintains the FOB. I turn it (escalator) on for an hour until I complete my sweeping work,” the sweeper, who was not willing to disclose her name, said.
 
 Four other FOBs (near MEPZ in  , in Chromepet, on   in Perungudi and in Velachery) were inaugurated on the same day in 2014. All the FOBs have dysfunctional escalators and have encountered maintenance troubles from time-to-time resulting in decreased patronage. Social activist V  , a resident of Chromepet, told TOI that the maintenance of escalator-fitted FOBs has been largely ignored by the state highways department.
 
 “These (FOBs) are hardly maintained though it was part of the agreement with the contractor who constructed it. The structures are also not well lit,” he said. Santhanam added that his repeated pleas to the highways department to take corrective measures did not bear fruit.
 
 The Highways department officials were unavailable for comment.
