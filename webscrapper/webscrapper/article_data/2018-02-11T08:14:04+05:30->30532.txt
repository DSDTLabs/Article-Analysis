ROHTAK: A bunch of fraudsters in   tried to cheat people in chief minister  's ancestral village -   in   - by using the Pradhan Mantri Rozgaar Yojana. But all four of them were nabbed by alert villagers before they could get away with their audacious scheme. 

 Police officers told TOI that the four persons - identified as Arun, Babita, Rahul and Anju - were aware that Banyani is Khattar's village because they too are from Rohtak. But that did not deter them trying to dupe people. In fact, they had successfully conned 14 people in neighbouring Lahli village with the same trick and collected Rs 15,600.
 
 The four reached Banyani on Friday and started spreading the word that they were employees from the additional deputy commissioner's office in Rohtak. They assured the villagers that they would get them Rs 2.5 lakh each under the PM employment scheme within three months if they filled up a form for a price. The fraudsters were taking Rs 1,200 each from those who had PAN cards and Rs 1,000 from those who didn't.
 
 However, the villagers got suspicious when the four refused to reveal their names. 
 
 
 
 
 Sarpanch Reema Vij’s husband, Bansi Vij, also reached the spot and started questioning the four people. Vij finally decided to call the police who arrested the four. Kalanaur SHO Rajinder Kumar said the accused have been booked for cheating and breach of trust. The police have also recovered Rs 5,000 from them.
 
 Additional deputy commissioner Ajay Kumar confirmed that his office had not sent anyone to fill up forms under the Pradhan Mantri Rozgaar Yojana and that people should be vigilant when such fraudsters approach them. “The administration will start an awareness drive to sensitise people about such tricksters,” he said.
 
 The four were produced in a court in Rohtak on Saturday and sent to 3 days’ police remand.
