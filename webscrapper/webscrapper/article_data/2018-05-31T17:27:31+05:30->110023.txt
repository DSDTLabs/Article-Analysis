The terrible loss of India’s first female superstar   left each and everyone bereaved and heartbroken. While her fans are still coming to terms with the huge loss of such a significant personality, her family members are trying their best to overcome this loss and move forward with her blessings.

 
 
 
 Janhvi Kapoor, who will be making her debut in ‘
 ’ soon, recently interacted with a magazine and spoke at length about her mother. She said that coping with this unbearable loss has been difficult but they are all trying to move on slowly with her presence constantly being felt. She further added how in the absence of her mother, her younger sister   is taking care of her. 
 
 
 Talking about maternal instincts, Janhvi revealed that she has always been bad at that, when on the other hand, Khushi is very maternal with her. Janhvi also professed that she is a complete baby and so Khushi leaves no stone unturned to take of her, and sometimes even puts her to sleep just like how Sridevi would do.
 
 
 Janhvi admitted that she was really dependent on Sridevi and said that she could always be the baby with her. Whenever she’s wake up, the first thing she’d do was ask for her and would often need her mother to put her to sleep. There were also times when Sridevi would literally feed her as well. 
 
 
 Recollecting the day before she left for the wedding, Janhvi confessed that since she had to shoot, and couldn’t sleep, she asked Sridevi to put her to sleep. But, since she was packing, by the time she came to her, she was half asleep, but she could feel her patting my head.
