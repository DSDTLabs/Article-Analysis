Chandigarh: Tree lovers need to visit the Sector-10 Government Museum and Art Gallery on the coming Sunday morning for the launch of Chandigarh  .

 This is a regular initiative of the Chandigarh Tree lovers group, which acquaints the Tricity residents with the heritage trees of City Beautiful at the onset of spring. The walk is guided by experts such as Harjit Singh Dhillon and Rajnish Wattas, co-authors of the book, ‘Trees of Chandigarh’. The walk will begin at 7.30am and continue for an hour. During the stroll, the participants will be educated about the campus trees.
 
 Wattas, group’s founding member and expert for the day, said here on Wednesday that the museum’s trees of a large variety were in bloom, “redolent in a riot of colours”. The walk is open to the general public and the timings are 7.30 to 8.30 am. The interested residents need to register for the limited slots. The group has organised several Tree Walks before in the city and been part of making a report on the heritage trees of Chandigarh.
 
 On World Environment Day (June 4) in 2016, The Times of India joined hands with residents of Chandigarh to form a group called Chandigarh Tree Lovers. It aims at protecting the green heritage of City Beautiful and has organise various Tree Walks for school and college students to connect them with their green heritage and educate them about the variety of tree species in the city.
