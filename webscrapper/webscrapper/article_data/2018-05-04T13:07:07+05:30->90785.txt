NEW DELHI: On Thursday, it was confirmed that India captain   will skip Afghanistan’s debut Test match for a one-month stint with London club   ahead of a bumper tour of England this summer. Looking to hone his batting skills in bowler-friendly conditions in England - who doesn’t remember his abysmal tour there in 2014? - Kohli will play for Surrey through June, meaning he will be available for four County Championship matches against Hampshire, Somerset and Yorkshire and possibly three one-day games versus Kent, Middlesex and Glamorgan. 

 
 
 
 This makes Kohli the fourth Indian cricketer after Cheteshwar Pujara (Yorkshire), Ishant Sharma (Sussex) and Varun Aaron (Leicestershire) to be allowed to play   this season by the BCCI. 
 
 
 
 Following Kohli’s signing with Surrey for the month of June, here’s a look at some of the other leading Indian cricketers who had county stints in the past. 
 
 
 
 The Indian batting legend played one season for Somerset, finishing with 686 run from 15 first-class matches at an average of 34.29. Gavaskar struggled during an unusually wet English summer and managed two scores of note: a second-innings 138 versus Surrey at The Oval and 75 against Gloucestershire. In 16 one-day matches for Somerset, he scored fifties against Glamorgan and Nottinghamshire, 90 against Kent and 123 in a one-run loss to Middlesex. 
 
 
 
 Across two seasons in the early 1990s, Azharuddin played 31 first-class matches for Derbyshire from which he totalled 2728 runs at an average of 54.56. The former India captain was the club’s overseas player between 1991 and 1994, and scored nine hundreds and 11 half-centuries, with a best of 212, in first-class cricket to go with 1029 runs at 46.77 in 30 one-day innings. 
 
  
  
 
 In his first season (1991) with Derbyshire, Azharuddin scored 2016 first-class runs at just under 60, with seven centuries and ten fifties, to go with 500 one-day runs. Unable to return to the county until 1994, Azharuddin touched down in late April and immediately got down to business against Durham at Queens Park, Chesterfield, scoring 55 in Derbyshire's first innings of 341. Forced to follow-on in reply to Durham's mammoth 625/6, Derby were lifted by Azharuddin's outstanding 205 off 270 balls out of a team total of 442. Derbyshire lost the match but Azharuddin had won many more admirers for his brilliant batting.
 
 He ended up averaging over 70 in the one-day matches that season, which proved to be his last with Derbyshire as international commitments took precedence.
 
 
 
 
 Three years after making his Test debut, a 19-year-old Tendulkar made history by becoming the first overseas cricketer to play for Yorkshire. He scored over 1070 runs in 16 County Championship matches at an average of 46.52, with seven fifties and a 96-ball century versus Durham. In his own words, Tendulkar referred to that stint as “one of the greatest four-and-a-half-months I have spent in my life”. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 The Indian pace bowler, at the age of 25, enjoyed a bumper season for Gloucestershire in which he took 87 wickets. Srinath had been contacted by Gloucestershire after West Indian fast bowler Courtney Walsh recommended his name to the club, and the man dubbed the Mysore Express emerged the fifth-highest wicket-taker of the 1995 county season.
 
 Srinath proved an immediate fit at Gloucester, finding success with the ball as the leader of the pack and contributing to the team's success that season. Gloucester finished sixth in the Championship, winning eight of 17 matches. Srinath had a hand in each of those victories with 39 wickets. 
 
 The highlight of Srinath’s stint was an extraordinary outing against Glamorgan at Pen-y-Pound in Abergavenny, Wales where he had career-best figures of 21-3-76-9 on August 26, 1995 near the end of the season. 
 
 
 
 That same season, Srinath’s Karnataka and India team-mate played for Northamptonshire and was the only bowler to top 100 wickets - an achievement that made him one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year. Standing in for Curtly Ambrose, Kumble enjoyed a fantastic season after being told by his county skipper Allan Lamb that he had to take 100 County wickets: 105 wickets at a superb average of 20.40 from more than 900 overs, thus helping Northants to third in the table. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Dravid played for Kent in the 2000 English domestic season, scoring 1221 runs in 16 first-class matches at an average of 55.50, with two centuries; 437 runs at 43.70 in the 50-over National League, managing a century and two fifties; and 50 runs in two Benson & Hedges matches followed by 76 runs in two NatWest Trophy fixtures. Dravid left a position impression on Kent, who were coached by John Wright at the time, and by his own admission those five-odd months in England made him a better batsman. A year later, Dravid’s reputation as one of the modern game’s premier batsmen was stamped. 
 
 Three seasons later, Dravid had a second county stint, this time with Scotland. Following a duck against Pakistan in a tour match, Dravid put up scores of 120* versus Somerset and 129 against Nottinghamshire, and when his time with Scotland commenced, his stats were 600 National League runs at 66.66, with a total of three hundreds and two fifties.
 
 
 
 Recommended to Lancashire by Australian Bob Simpson, who had been a consultant with the Indian team at the 1999 World Cup in England, Ganguly’s first taste of county cricket was mixed. In the four-day games, he managed 671 runs from 21 innings at an average of 31.95, with six fifties (his highest score was 99). The Benson & Hedges Cup was dismal, with 62 runs in six innings, but in the National League and Natwest Trophy, the then Indian captain was regal. Ganguly’s National League form saw him reel off 569 runs in 13 innings at an average of nearly 52, and he averaged 100 in three Natwest innings after scoring 200 with a best of 135*. 
 
  
  
 
 In 2005, Ganguly was signed by Glamorgan and scored a hundred and three half-centuries in nine first-class innings for an average of 62.57, but struggled in the T20s with 114 runs in five innings. 
 
 He returned to England the following season on a short-team contract with Northamptonshire as a replacement for Chris Rogers, and averaged 4.80 in six County Championship games, made 80 runs in a couple of 50-over fixtures and 220 runs in nine T20s.
 
 
 
 During a busy period for Indian cricketers in county cricket, Kaif turned out for Leicestershire in 2002 in one Championship match (56 runs) and one National League match (60*). In 2003, he played for Derbyshire and scored 332 first-class runs in 15 innings with a best of 87, 225 runs from eight National League games, scored two fifties in two C&G Trophy appliances and averaged 18.53 in five Twenty20 Cup innings with a solitary half-century.
 
 
 
 Sehwag’s first and only stint in English domestic cricketer came after a successful World Cup in South Africa. His stint with Leicestershire was not particularly successful and had to be cut short when he suffered a back injury. In ten four-day games, Sehwag scored 478 runs and averaged 47.80 (with two centuries and one fifty) which was second to Brad Hodge's 62.29 for Leicestershire that season. In the National League, he managed 233 runs in seven games at 33.28 and made three half-centuries, 74 runs in three C&G Trophy games and 86 in six T20 innings. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Also in 2003, Yuvraj became only the second Indian to sign for Yorkshire after Tendulkar in 1992. Hoping to enhance his game in bowler-friendly conditions as his international stock was on the rise, Yuvraj struggled. He averaged a lowly 14.55 in 12 first-class innings, 21.12 in eight National League appearances and scored 27 in his one C&G Trophy game. The T20 completion was more fruitful, with 154 runs at an average of 30.80 with one half-century. Like Sehwag, Yuvraj was never called on again in county cricket. 
 
 
 
 The left-arm quick played one match for Surrey in 2004, but two years later mounted a comeback to the Indian team with a stunning season for Worcestershire. Using the conditions exceptionally, Zaheer took 78 first-class wickets from 16 games and 28 in 14 limited-overs fixtures, enhancing his skills to storm back into the national side. To this day, Zaheer credits that summer with Worcestershire as hugely influential. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Pujara, a regular in India’s Test team, is in his fourth county spell currently, for Yorkshire. He first played county cricket for Derbyshire in 2013, albeit briefly, scoring 219 runs in six first-class innings with an unbeaten century and 90 not out his stand-out performances. 
 
 In 2015, Pujara emulated Tendulkar and Yuvraj by playing for Yorkshire. His form helped the club win the County Championship - 264 runs in six innings, an average of 52.80, with a century and a fifty. 
 
 In 2017, he had two stints with Nottinghamshire and finished with 333 runs from 12 innings, averaging 27.75 with one century and one half-century. 
 
 Pujara is currently back with Yorkshire, with scores of 2, 18, 7 and 6 in two Championship games.
