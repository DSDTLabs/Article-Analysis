KOLKATA: A senior Union health ministry official has come down heavily on a section of the city’s physicians for flouting the guidelines laid down for   prevention and recommending a battery of diagnostic tests to suspected patients. 

 According to PC Sen, deputy director of the  , doctors in Kolkata had been needlessly asking dengue suspect patients to undergo a series of tests that were not required. 
 
 The matter came up during a meeting held at the KMC headquarters on Saturday. Though it is only mid-February and monsoon is still some time away, malaria and dengue dominated the discussion. With the mosquito menace on the rise even this early, KMC has already begun regular drives in vulnerable localities and even started roping in specialists in dengue prevention.
 
 Saturday’s meeting with KMC health department officials, vector borne disease experts and physicians took stock of the prevailing mode of treatment for dengue in Kolkata, Salt Lake, Dum Dum, Sonarpur and other neighbouring areas. 
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Sen said: “A section of doctors have been resorting to an independent treatment procedure. They are suggesting a series of diagnostic tests at an early stage. This is not acceptable under the national vector borne disease control programme.”
 
 Atin Ghosh, the mayor-in-council member overseeing the KMC health department, asked physicians to take the initiative and alert KMC on cases that test positive for dengue so that drives can be undertaken to prevent the disease from spreading. 
 
 Officials of the   said that they were taking necessary measures to control the onslaught of mosquitoes. “Fogging machines are being provided to each of the 41 wards. The immediate need is to have a flow of water in   and Eastern Drainage canals so that water does not stagnate,” said   (health) Pranoy Roy.
