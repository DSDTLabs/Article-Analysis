PANAJI: The state government is likely to extend its contract with  , which is implementing its cashless insurance scheme,   (DDSSY) by a few more months. It’s likely to be extended till August as the government is unable to finalise a new bidder.

 A source said that the directorate of   services floated a tender in March, and they received bids from two insurance companies. The lowest bidder quoted Rs 8,100 per family as premium, which the department found rather high. The existing scheme saw the state government pay a premium of Rs 2,800 per family. This delayed the finalising of the new scheme.
 
 Under the new tender, not only did the number of interventions covered increase, but also the money paid for certain procedures. “There have been some changes in the scheme, but we can’t afford to pay so high a premium,” said a source.
 
 The government’s liability on the account of this scheme is about Rs 80 crore a year, which would jump to Rs 300 crore if it accepted the increased premium of Rs 8,100 per family.
 
 “It’s a huge liability for any government to pay,” a source said. “With its finances under strain, it will be a difficult task.” 
 
 The scheme has been a source of controversy right from the beginning, with accusations that the scheme has benefitted private hospitals more than the people of the state.
 
 Health minister   himself admitted that scheme had a lot of loopholes, and hence, they decided to float a new scheme. 
 
 Some officials attached to the government are of the strong opinion that the scheme needs to be discarded immediately. They argue, with the government already expanding its public health facilities, there is no need for it to operate a seperate insurance scheme.
