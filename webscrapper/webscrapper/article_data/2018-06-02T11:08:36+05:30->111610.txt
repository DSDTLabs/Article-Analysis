PANAJI: The regional   exchange is unable to maintain an updated list, as several private sector employers are not notifying vacancies to the exchange as required under the relevant provisions.

 In a bid to streamline information about vacancies in the private sector, the government has asked all such employers to notify vacancies and obtain no objection certificate ( ) from the exchange for advertising the vacant posts through print/electronic media or any other mode of advertising. NOCs are required to be obtained for participating in job fairs outside the state. Organizers conducting such fairs in Goa are also required to obtain NOCs from the employment exchange.
 
 Applications for NOCs have to be submitted online to the employment officer in the office of commissioner labour and employment,  , on www.goaonline.gov.in. The employment exchange will convey its decision within 48 hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays)
