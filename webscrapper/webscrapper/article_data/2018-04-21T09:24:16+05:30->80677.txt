JAIPUR: The implementation   and GST has changed the dynamics of the real estate industry, bring the focus back on the end-users. The annual real estate expo of Credai Rajasthan this year that opened on Friday bears testimony to this reality where the customer becomes the king again.

 “RERA and GST has weeded out non-serious players from the market. Along with them, the most of the investors have also disappeared. It’s now a market for the users only and accordingly we have realigned the thrust of the expo by showcasing only ready-to-move-in projects,” said  , president of Credai, Rajasthan.
 
 Sharma said earlier the ratio between end-users and investors used to be 50:50 but it is around 80:20.
 
 There is also a change in the preference of the consumers who are looking for properties which are ready for possession. This is pushing developers to focus on quality over quantity.
 
 “The real estate market has undergone some fundamental changes post RERA. The focus now is on end-users which, in turn, has added importance to quality over quantity. Since the pipeline of new projects have eased, the unsold inventory is also getting shrunk. Industry-wide, the percentage of unsold properties in the ready-for-possession would be around 35% which is good news for the developers’ community,” said Anand Mishra, joint secretary, Credai-Rajasthan.
 
 More than 40 real estate builders and developers is showcasing over 100 projects including residential flats, industrial plots, arm houses, villas, premium offices, commercial apartments ranging from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 5 crore.
