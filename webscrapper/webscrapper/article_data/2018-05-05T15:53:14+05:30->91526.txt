NEW DELHI: Their batsmen are in top form but   would look to plug the bowling loopholes when they take on a struggling   in a key IPL game between the southern rivals at the MCA Stadium in Pune on Saturday.

 
 The Virat-Kohli led RCB, who edged out Mumbai Indians by 14 runs in their last game, will be eager to avenge their five-wicket defeat at home against the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led Super Kings, who too will be keen to swiftly get back into the winning mode after suffering two defeats in their last three games.
 
 
 
 For the star-studded RCB, the clash is a must-win encounter if it has to stay alive in the tournament and qualify for the play-offs.
 
 While RCB are in the fifth spot, having won three of their eight matches, CSK are still in a comfortable position in second position with six wins from nine games.
 
 Here are the details of when, where and how you can follow all the action from the IPL match between Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore to be played at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune.
