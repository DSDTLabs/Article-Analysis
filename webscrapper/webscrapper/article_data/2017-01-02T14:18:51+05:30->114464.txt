KOCHI: In a bid to bring the loss-making company back on track, the administrative wing of   (TELK) has instructed its employees to come out of the virtual world. The company has gone the extra mile by banning smartphones in office after observing that workers going `social' has affected its production.
 
 A joint venture company of Government of Kerala and   Limited in Angamaly, it has been running on loss for the past two financial years.
 
 “We have found that majority of the employees use Facebook and WhatsApp during working hours. It did not sound right especially at a time when the company is going through a very difficult phase. This year, TELK got more orders from various firms and our target is to touch Rs 172 crore by the end of this fiscal.For the same everyone has to work hard,“ said N C Mohanan, chairman of the company.
 
 The decision to ban smartphones inside the office was taken unanimously, on December 1, after holding talks with workers' unions in the company, added Mohanan.
 
 Now, only the managing director and chairman are allowed to use smartphones inside the company.
 
 A total of 535 employees including engineers, financial officers, supervisors and workers in production units have been provided   (CUG) phones in order to make calls to members of their work groups.
 
 The company has registered a loss of Rs 47 crore in the past two financial years.
 
 "If a group of employees work on a product and one stays away at least for five minutes, it will have adverse effect on the whole project. In the first six months of this financial year, we could achieve production worth Rs 32 crore only. We need make it Rs 100 crore in the next three months. If the company runs into profit, the government will allocate funds for its modernisation," said  , vice-president of the TELK employees' union (CITU), adding that the employees support the move wholeheartedly.
