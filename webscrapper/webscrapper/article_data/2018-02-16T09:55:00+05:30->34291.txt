CHENNAI: The   might have won the senior national championships but they have not got any richer. The   didn’t have any prize money to offer to the champions in Cuttack on Wednesday. It was learnt that only the best players in the knockout rounds were awarded cheques by the host state government.

 Interestingly, the AIFF had awarded a decent cash prize of Rs 5 lakh to Bengal last year for becoming the men’s national champions. Chairman of TN women’s committee   informed that the girls were heartbroken. “It’s the least the girls can expect. They are heartbroken and sad. They are from humble backgrounds. So they expected some financial reward for their feat. However, there were none,” Mohaideen told TOI on Thursday.
 
 For TN, striker   received Rs 5,000 and Rs 20,000 for becoming the player of the match in the quarterfinals and final while Indhrani got Rs 10,000 for the best player in the semis. The AIFF, though, had arranged for the teams’ stay and provided for the players’ daily allowances. “We travelled first-class in train and returned by flight. However, we will only get reimbursement for second-class fare in train. This entire issue is grossly unfair,” Mohaideen added.
 
 A top AIFF official said that this has been the norm for many years. “It’s not the first time this has happened. It's unfortunate. But yes, we will definitely want to address the issue in future,” said the official.
