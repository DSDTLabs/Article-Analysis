AHMEDABAD: From Monday, the   office of   (AMC) has been   on  , to ensure that public spaces are free of vehicles and encroachments. The TDO office warned of “action” against companies and offices who fail to comply with the notice. Angry traders, restaurant and shop owners barged into New West Zone office and argued with the TDO and lodged their protest against the notices. 

 “They are threatening us. We have paid impact fees so that the AMC creates parking facilities, which is central to our businesses. We want the civic body to first create facilities and then impose laws,” says Rashesh Parekh, the owner of a furniture store on SG Highway. AMC officials called police to control the situation. 
 
 Since 2015, AMC had earmarked parking spots on SG Highway for various categories of vehicles, on the 4.7km stretch between Karnavati Club and Hebatpur-Sola. Traders say that parking coupons and monthly pass schemes were promised earlier. 
 
 “None of these parking schemes have come. Instead all of this ended in a scam,” says Prabhat Chaudhary, a snack stall owner. A senior AMC official told TOI, “Almost 65% of the people, who park haphazardly on this stretch, do not have any business there,” said a senior AMC official. 
 
 “We had warned commercial property owners here vehicles parked outside designated parking spots will either be towed away or locked and the owners will be fined more than Rs250,” added the AMC official. Parking facilities for 1,400 two-wheelers and 530 cars, apart from auto-rickshaws and light commercial vehicles, was set up on SG Road.
