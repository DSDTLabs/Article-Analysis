Surat: The income tax (I-T) department has launched prosecution cases for failure to file returns, tax evasion and not remitting or deducting tax deducted at source (TDS) in 102 cases. Proceedings will begin in more than 400 cases before March 31 this year.  Principal chief commissioner of I-T, Gujarat, Anup Kumar Jaiswal, who visited the I-T headquarters on Wednesday to inaugurate the newly constructed apartment buildings for the employees said, “We are not going to spare the defaulters who have not filed their returns. Most of the prosecution cases are related to tax not remitted to the department by employers. They deducted TDS from employees’ salary and sit on them for months to earn interest. We will take strict legal action.” Jaiswal said Surat region has 54 cases of defaults and prosecution has been launched in six cases till date. He said there are a total of 144 cases of benami property in the state, of which 86 cases are from Surat.  In 85 cases, the department has issued attachment orders.  He appreciated the tax payers in the Diamond City for achieving the growth in collection target by almost 50.68 per cent in the current financial year. “Gujarat’s total growth in I-T collection is at 18% net. There are two big corporate companies who have paid less returns than their actuals. We are investigating why they failed to show less returns, otherwise we could have achieved 24% growth.” According to Jaiswal, 32 recovery surveys have been done in 2017-18 and the total demand is of Rs 11.04 crore in Surat alone. Apart from this, around 20-25 properties of defaulters in Gujarat will be auctioned in the coming days. Recently, the Surat I-T department auctioned a property of a defaulter and one more property will be sold in the coming days.  Jaiswal added, “Surat has added 1.19 lakh new tax payers in the current financial year. The total tax payers in the city have gone up from 9.74 lakh in March-2014 to 15.37 lakh in March-2017, showing a growth of 57%.
