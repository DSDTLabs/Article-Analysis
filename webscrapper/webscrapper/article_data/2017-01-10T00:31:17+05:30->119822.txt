CHENNAI: It is more than a month since the death of J Jayalalithaa, but police plans to hold a tighter grip on those who had spread   about the former chief minister’s health condition when she was in hospital. The Chennai city police has planned to transfer the defamatory case on social media user Tamizhachi and 52 other cases pending before the cybercrime wing to a central agency. 

 During the review conducted recently at the city police commissioner’s office, the officers decided to transfer the cases either to the CB-CID or CBI through the state police head  . The move is with the view of bringing to book the suspects who live abroad, which entails extradition and other legal procedures. 
 
 The cybercrime wing so far has arrested eight people for spreading false information about Jayalalithaa’s health. On September 30, the first case was registered against Tamizhachi, believed to be residing in France for spreasing these rumours. An arrest was made on October 18, when Sagayam, a resident of Tuticorin, was picked up for allegedly spreading these rumours on social media. Though there has been little progress on the case after Jayalalithaa’s death, police are determined to punish the offenders. 
 
 “If we close these cases, it would become a bad example for others in future. People would easily take to speculating and spreading rumours,” said a senior police officer, adding that the rumours had reduced significantly after the police cases were registered.
 
 People use social media to abuse and spread rumours about celebrities and most get away with it unless a formal complaint is made. “It is very difficult for us to nail pranksters on social media after the Section 66 of Information Technology Act was scrapped by the  . We were waiting for a proper case to crack down on these people and this is our chance,” said another police officer.
