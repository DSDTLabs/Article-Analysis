The Goa   Association has told chief minister Manohar Parrikar that they have neither boycotted the   U-17 World Cup nor are they responsible for the absence of any Goan player in the Indian team.
 
  Parrikar touched upon the   and the FIfa U-17 World Cup during the presentation of the Dilip Sardesai Award on Friday. The chief minister blamed the GFA for the abject disappointment suffered by fans in the state.
  
  “Sports is definitely on the rise in the state but coming to football, the India Under-17 team does not have a single Goan player because our association (GFA) are better than us politicians when it comes to fighting amongst themselves,” Parrikar said.
  
  On Saturday, a GFA delegation led by vice-president Schubert Furtado met the chief minister and cleared the air.
  
  “We have not boycotted the international event and are ever willing to be associated with the historical event in India. I am sure the chief minister will intervene and give the state association its due recognition,” said Furtado.
  
  The GFA has been at loggerheads with the local organising committee (LOC) and has accused them of bypassing them for more than two years. GFA president   had also complained about the LOC to Fifa, the governing body for world football.
  
  The absence of a Goan player in the India U-17 team has been placed at the doorstep of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and former coach Nicolai Adam. The GFA believes that Goan players never got a chance to prove themselves while Nicolai Adam and the selectors kept looking for talent elsewhere in the country.
  
  Four Goan players were in contention for a place in the Indian team. Midfielders Ribhav Sardesai and Amay Morajkar, defender Flan Gomes and goalkeeper Antonio Dylan D’Silva were all India regulars in U-14 tournaments but eventually fell by the wayside.
  
  Except for goalkeeper Dylan, whose parents got him out of the academy, the others were dropped.
