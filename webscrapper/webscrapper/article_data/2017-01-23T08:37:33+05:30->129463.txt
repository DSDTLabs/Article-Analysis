MARGAO: Chief minister of Delhi and national coordinator of AAP,  , on Sunday dared defence minister   to disclose the “secret deal” struck by him with former chief minister   for his “inaction” in the alleged Rs 36,000 crore illegal mining scam believed to be perpetrated by Kamat.

 “I can dare say this from a public platform that this is a setting between Parrikar and Digambar. I ask Parrikar to tell the people what’s the deal between you and Digambar. Where is the Rs 36,000 crore that you had promised to recover?” Kejriwal said, while addressing the public rally at Margao.
 
 He said that the AAP, if it comes to power, will investigate the mining scam and punish all those found guilty, “no matter howsoever mighty they might be.”
 
 Rooting for sustainable mining, Kejriwal said that the welfare of all mining-dependents will be duly protected if the AAP government came to power in the state. 
 
 “Goa’s mining will be developed into modern mining, in such a way that it will demonstrate to the world what sustainable mining is all about,” Kejriwal said.
 
 Reiterating his accusation that the Congress and the BJP have entered into a secret pact to share power every alternate term, Kejriwal urged the people to “put an end to their friendly match” by voting AAP to power.
 
 Condemning the alleged attack on AAP volunteers working for the Margao candidate Shailesh Raiturkar, Kejriwal accused both the Congress and the BJP for being behind it. 
 
 Stating that all government policies in Goa were driven by corruption, Kejriwal urged the people to vote for AAP to provide honest, efficient and transparent government. 
 
 Earlier, AAP’s chief ministerial candidate, Elvis Gomes, held Kamat responsible for what he called the “decaying” state of Margao, despite being its MLA for the last 22 years. Pointing out to Margao’s Sonsoddo garbage problem, Gomes assured to resolve the garbage issue within six months of AAP coming to power.
