Ahmedabad: The screening of   film ‘Martyrs of Marriage,’ directed by Gurgaon-based independent filmmaker  , took place at   on Sunday. 

 The film, which earlier travelled to Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata, was viewed by the members of legal and police fraternity along with those implicated in   laws under IPC Section 498A.
 
 Bharadwaj said that her personal experience put her on the path to research on the issue. “I started documenting cases four years ago. In this film, we have covered three cases where the accused in dowry cases have committed suicide. There are also four case studies showing the other side of the coin. In a state like Gujarat, the conviction rate in dowry cases is not more than 2.4%, according to NCRB figures,” she said.
 
 “Our concern is just to ensure that the law, for protection of women, should not be misused and seen as a means to get even after squabbles. We are also creating awareness among the judiciary,” she added.
