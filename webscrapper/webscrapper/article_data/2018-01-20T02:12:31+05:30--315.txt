NEW DELHI: The Yogendra Yadav-led Swaraj India on Friday said that the Election Commission’s move to recommend disqualification of 20   legislators for holding offices of profit was on expected lines. The appointments were not just a technical violation of constitutional norms, but also a serious case of political immorality by the CM, the party said.

 Yadav said: “The decision was on expected lines (and) as per the due process of law. It is a case of stupidity, or their (AAP) inability to understand the grammar of governance.” 
 
 Anupam, chief of Swaraj India’s Delhi unit, said: “In his desperation for power and to influence his MLAs when the duo (Yadav and Bhushan) questioned the lack of principles, transparency and accountability within the party, (chief minister)   made the appointments in return for loyalty.”
 
 While Yadav ruled out the possibility of financial bungling, he didn’t mince words in attacking Kejriwal for “rewarding people to stay with him”. He said: “It is a case of arrogance…that we don’t need to know the law. It also reflects his (Kejriwal’s) insecurity.” He added: “Other political parties have also done this, but they have been smart enough to bring in a law first. But they tried to fix it in retrospect.”
