NEW DELHI: Union minister   on Monday used strong words to hit out at  's foreign affairs head   for not having "the courtesy even to acknowledge" her letter to him urging he grant a visa to

  is the Indian national on death row in Pakistan. 
 
 External affairs minister Swaraj's comments were primarily intended to clear the air after Pakistani media reports last week said that India has refused medical visas to people from that country,
 
 On Twitter, Swaraj as much as said that it's Aziz's fault that Pakistanis in need of urgent medical attention are unable to come to India. She assured Pakistanis that India is happy to grant medical visas and hoped Aziz "has consideration for the nationals of his country".
 
 
 
  
 The external affairs minister pointed to recently-changed rules that stipulate Pakistanis wanting a visa for urgent medical treatment must get a letter from Aziz. "But I assure Pakistan nationals seeking medical visa with a recommendation from Mr.Sartaj Aziz, we will issue the visa immediately," said Swaraj.
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 Then, Swaraj delivered her coup de grace. 
 
 The minister talked about how India too has a visa application pending "for an Indian national Mrs. Avantika Jadhav who wants to meet her son in Pakistan". It takes a beat to realise she's talking about the mother of  , the Indian national sentenced to death by a military court in Pakistan.for allegedly "spying".
 
  
  
  
  
 
 Swaraj said just like the letters Aziz must write for the medical visas, she, too wrote a "personal letter" to him for the grant of Avantika Jadhav's visa. 
 
 "However, Mr. Aziz has not shown the courtesy even to acknowledge my letter," she said.
 
  
  
  
  
 Pakistani media reported last week that the Indian embassy in Pakistan rejected the visa 
  who was to come to India for treatment. The woman, Faiza Tanveer, in several tweets over the past couple of days, urged Swaraj to intervene. It appears Swaraj has.
