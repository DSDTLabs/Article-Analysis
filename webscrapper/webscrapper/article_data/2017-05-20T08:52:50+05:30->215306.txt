PANAJI: Following the   (GSPCB) ultimatum to   companies in the state to furnish their bank guarantee by Friday, many mining companies in the state have sought time from   to furnish their bank guarantee.

 The board meeting that was scheduled for Friday to decide on granting consent to operate to 39 mining companies has now been rescheduled to Tuesday. The meeting was postponed because it wants to collect more data on ambient   quality.
 
 The bank guarantee has been sought in the eventuality that the leaseholder fails to adhere to air quality norms.
