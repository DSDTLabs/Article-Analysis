Lehragaga: Former state finance minister and SAD MLA Parminder Singh Dhindsa said on Tuesday that Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) would support the ruling Congress on pro-Punjab issues in the state assembly. 

 Dhindsa, who was elected to the assembly after defeating Congress stalwart Rajinder Kaur Bhattal from Lehra Gaga constituency by a margin of 26,815 votes, said his party would support “virtuous works”, but strongly oppose any anti-people policies of the government.
 
 Dhindsa’s statement came while touring the villages of his new constituency to thank voters for electing him. He said the defeat of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the state elections had proved it was “just a bubble that burst”. “The party could only perform at limited seats in Barnala, Sangrur, Bathinda, Mansa and Moga districts, but it faced a complete rout at other places. The fight is still between Congress and SAD,” he added.
 
 Discussing the issue of drugs in Punjab, Dhindsa said their government had taken enough measures to control the menace and they would support any action taken by the Congress for elimination of narcotics in the state.
 
 On the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal issue, he said SAD would not let anyone take even a single drop of water. “I request all the parties to mutually oppose the completion of the canal and stand in virtue of the people,” he added.
