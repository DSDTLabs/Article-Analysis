HYDERABAD: While stress is one of primary reasons for heart attacks, little do people know that it can also trigger asthma attacks. Doctors warn that while environmental causes can be avoided, stress is difficult to tackle.

 “There is a clear connection between stress and asthma and this has been established in many studies,” said Dr  , a consultant pulmonologist with  . “It (stress-related asthma attack) can be caused by even crying and it is common mostly among patients in the age group of 25 to 40 years,” he said
 
 Uncontrolled asthma on its own can create stress. If patients have trouble inhaling, it's bound to create anxiety and, in turn, make the asthma condition worse. Family, financial, or work-related stress has been shown to worsen the overall severity of asthma, though the exact mechanism by which this happens is not clear.
 
 “When stress strikes and breathing becomes difficult one should use breathing relaxation techniques and Pranayamaa is a good solution,” Dr  , a private practitioner, said.
 
 Doctors say that asthma affects all age groups but often starts in childhood. Asthma cannot be cured, but can be controlled, Chandra said.
 
 “The strongest risk factors for developing asthma is exposure to indoor allergens such as domestic mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture. Cats, cockroaches, room freshners, toilet cleaners, incense sticks, cigarette smoke, allergies and a family history can cause asthma,” Dr V  .V, consultant interventional pulmonologist at KIMS Hospitals, Secunderabad, said. Other risk factors, include certain drugs like aspirin, betablockers and pain killers as well as low birth weight and respiratory infection.
