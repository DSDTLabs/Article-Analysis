 “We have been organizing this tournament for the last 15 years. The royal Gaekwad family has made immense contribution to cricket in the city that has produced several international cricketers. Late Maharaja Ranjitsinh after whom this tournament has been named, was a nice person. He was humility personified,” said Mahurkar, who celebrated his 83rd birthday on Friday. WRMS members garlanded Mahurkar amid beats of dhol. 
 
 Royal scion   said that this cricket tournament is now Gujarat’s biggest tourney. “Every year we celebrate Mahurkar dada’s birthday with this tournament. Railways, in fact, have a big contribution to Vadodara cricket as many of the cricketers have been hired by it. I hope that women’s cricket matches too are included in this tournament,” Gaekwad said.
