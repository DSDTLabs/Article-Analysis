AHMEDABAD: City cops nabbed a gang of seven armed robbers from near   in Amraiwadi on Monday night. Police sources said the gang is from   and had come to the city to commit robbery and house break-ins. Police recovered a loaded revolver, tools to commit burglaries and gold and silver jewellery worth Rs10 lakh. Police sources said the gang had stolen the revolver from a house in Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh. "We have informed UP police about the arrest of the gang," said a police official. Senior police officials said the kingpin of the gang,  , used to work as a bus conductor in UP, but took to crime after being fired in a bus-ticket racket. 

 "He later formed a gang with Pramod Saroj, Shravan Joshi, Premchand Pasi, Suraj Saroj,   and Rajesh Pasi. They used to travel to different cities, commit robberies and then return to UP," said an investigator.
 
 "We suspect that the gang has committed such crimes in major cities of Gujarat, especially in Surat," he added.
 
 During interrogation of the accused it came to light that Mishra used to first visit the city they targeted. "Mishra would rent a house and identify possible targets. Once the target was fixed he would call in his associates to commit the robberies," said a police source.
 
 A senior police official said the gang members used to keep a sling with them. "Before committing a burglary- the gang would first shoot a stone with the sling at the house to check whether it was occupied or not. Once they ascertained the target was not occupied, they would go ahead with burglary," said the official. Police said the gang had been able to avoid police attention until now by working smart. "Rakesh Pasi and Rajesh Pasi, two of the gang members, were jewellers. The duo used to melt down the stolen gold jewellery soon after the burglary, so that the ornaments couldn't be identified- even if they got caught," a police official said.
