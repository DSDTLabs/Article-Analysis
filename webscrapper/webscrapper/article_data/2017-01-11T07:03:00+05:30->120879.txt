KOLKATA: Gusts of   made it feel cooler even though the   climbed up to 16.4 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. With the   (WD) fading away, the city is headed for a chillier spell from Friday. The   could drop to 12 degree Celsius and stay there for at least 72 hours, predicted the   (RMC).

 On Tuesday, the districts of Bankura, Birbhum and Burdwan received showers under the influence of the WD. “But the WD is losing its intensity and won’t have any more impact on the south Bengal  . Rather, the path is now clear for the north-westerly to blow in unobstructed. It is gaining in speed and the result was evident on Tuesday. The city was lashed by icy winds blowing in from the north-west which made it feel cooler even though the temperature rose by almost a degree from Monday. Now, the mercury will slide,” said G K Das, director, RMC.
 
 On Friday, the minimum temperature was predicted to slide to 12 degrees. “It could remain there since the north-westerly is active. Since Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh are being lashed by snow, the chilly winds will continue to flow in. We are probably heading for the coolest spell of the season,” said Das.
