Chandigarh: Taking the   granted by University Grants Commission (UGC) as an opportunity to explore collaborations and initiate new programmes, Panjab University vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar Grover said this autonomy gives the University a hope to conceive a medical sciences school at the university in collaboration with the PGIMER and other institutions like NIPER. 

 “On the lines of the integrated courses in the US and Canada, PU can start an integrated MBBS-MD course with no exit option,” said Grover while addressing media on Wednesday. 
 
 “Selection should be tough for enrollment into a medical school. So, once you enroll, you should come out with your masters. This is a programme that we have floated in the proposal of the institute of eminence,” said Prof Grover. 
 
 Describing this autonomy as a licence to think something new, Grover said earlier, it would have been difficult to convince the government agencies headed by bureaucrats to pursue this proposal. “However, in the light of yesterday’s decision, at least the university can take this proposal to the government,” he added.
 
 Moreover, Grover said this autonomy will help the university in foreign collaborations. “We are trying to establish an India, China and UK corridor via our partnership with the Nottingham University. The Chinese industry wants to support some research on British university campuses in China and they are willing to have us as a partner. This proposal would have been very difficult to sell to the government of India without this autonomy, because this is a very unconventional proposal. But this autonomy gives us the opportunity to attach wheels to this proposal,” said Grover adding that the joint programmes with the foreign universities have to be cleverly worked out.
