MHOW: The main   arrested in the loot and murder case of   Joshi and Himanshu Sen, was on Wednesday assaulted twice by people when he was being taken to the   of judicial magistrate first class here, officials said.

 Badgonda police station in charge Hitendra Singh Rathore said, the accused Balram Makwana, a resident of Basipipri village, was produced in the court of JMFC Ambuj Shrivastava since some formalities could not be completed due to advocates’ protest on Tuesday. 
 
 The court sent him to judicial remand on Wednesday. Rathore told that one more accused   is still absconding and a police team with the help of cyber experts is looking for him.
 
 Jitendra Joshi, Shreya’s uncle had a heated argument with Badgonda police station in charge Hitendra Rathore outside the courtroom on Wednesday. He alleged gross negligence by the police in solving the case.
 
 Talking to TOI, Joshi said that after Shreya went missing, they met police officers of all ranks but in vain. He alleged that since the mobile location of Shreya was traced in Telangana, Badgonda police was not looking at the case from any other angle. They always told them that the girl was not a minor and she could have married the boy since he was also missing.
 
 Joshi, later, complained about the matter at CM helpline, on which Badgonda police had submitted their request for closure of the complaint. He said that if monsoon had come, the skeletons must have washed away in the heavy flow of water and the mystery could have never been solved.
 
 A large group of women of Kodariya village under the leadership of Janpand member Sangita Tamboli and sarpanch Anuradha Joshi met ASP (rural) Nagendra Singh and handed over a memorandum for adequate security arrangements at risky picnic spots so that such incidents are not repeated in future.
