MUMBAI: The ongoing   near   is drawing vast crowds yet is being conducted in a pleasant orderly fashion as compared to previous years. Residents say that unlike the past, this year they are not inconvenienced by roadblocks or traffic diversions.

 Bandra fair begins on Sunday following Mother Mary's birthday which occurs September 8. This season it is underway from September 10-17.
 
 Local resident Lucy Fernandes said, "Cops have given car passes to residents of nearby buildings, but this year they are hardly even demanding to see them. I have moved up and down the hill several times since Sunday and I am pleasantly surprised to see the smooth movement of pedestrians and traffic this year."
 
 People who live in the vicinity seldom visit the fair given the crowds of outsiders. In fact more outsiders arrive to shop. A vast number of stalls selling wax idols of houses, babies, cradles and body parts are popular as offerings for wishes sought at the basilica. East Indian goodies like kadio bodio and homemade snacks also sell briskly.
 
 Throngs of worshippers of all faiths have been arriving for mass at the shrine since the day of Our Lady's Feast September 8.
 
 Bishop   who is the rector of Mount   said, "We had a series of masses Sunday morning and each was very crowded. That evening fewer people arrived though. But over Monday and Tuesday a steady stream of devotees has come. We had a special mass for the sick and elderly Monday morning where senior citizens from old age homes and several people from parishes across Mumbai joined." Bp John says they had arranged a cosy waterproof shamiana for worshippers given the heavy rains of the past week. "But now the weather is so hot we may have to devise an opening as it gets stuffy inside," he said.
 
 The archbishop of   will officiate at special mass at 11.30am on the closing Sunday of Bandra Fair September 17.
