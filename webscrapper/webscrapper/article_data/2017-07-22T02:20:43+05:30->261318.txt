NEW DELHI: Police are now considering the different appearances that the   absconding   may have used to dodge investigators. They are using computer-aided programmes to fix moustache, beard and hairdos to ascertain how the suspects will look like in disguise. 

 Raids are being conducted in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh to locate the four suspects. Four people have been arrested so far in the case. 
 
 The Uttar Pradesh STF and Uttarakhand police have been asked to be vigilant about movement of suspicious elements. The role of a woman who stayed with the siblings, Anuj and Sushil, at a rented apartment in Vasundhara, Ghaziabad, is also being probed. It is believed that the woman — known to one of the accused, Gaurav — had arranged for two of the locations where they had held the doctor captive.
 
 The abductors changed their locations frequently. Their run would have ended sooner had they not done so: inspector Aishbir from special staff in northeast district and inspector Bhushan from special cell had spread a large net of human-intelligence network to track their movement. Police were banking on the fact that the abductors would soon run out of options .
 
 Sources said police laid a trap after Ola agreed to pay the ransom. They arranged to pay the money in the way the abductors wanted them to: Rs 5 crore in bundles of Rs 500. However, the abductors suspected that something was amiss and changed their plans at the last moment. They asked for Rs 2,000 notes, instead. This gave them enough time to move the doctor to another location.
 
 Police suspect that the abductors timed their movement to coincide with the huge rush of Kanwar pilgrims, thus hampering the mobility of investigators. Probe revealed that the prime accused — Anuj and Sushil — were disowned by their family due to their past criminal activities. They were staying at an apartment in Vasundhara. They were aided by their cousin Pramod, who is also a history sheeter.
