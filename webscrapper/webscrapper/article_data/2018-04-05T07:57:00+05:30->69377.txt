Barmalipur (Payal): Seven months after the civil administration declared the building housing a government middle school unsafe, about 70 students continue to study there. Along with them, six teachers are also risking their lives. 

 On September 8, 2017, the then Payal SDM wrote in the diary of Government Middle School (GMS), Barmalipur, “I visited the GMS today and was really astonished to see that the building was unsafe and not even hygienic. Students take midday meal sitting on kucha ground, RO system and toilets are in good shape, but a lot is yet to be done.” After the report, a public works department (PWD) team visited the school for inspection on January 25 this year and found the building unsafe.
 
 The headmistress said they don’t have any other place to move the students. A teacher said the building, which was originally an inn, was constructed in 1954 and has developed cracks and could collapse anytime.
 
 The building also houses Government Primary School, but its headmistress said she got her students moved to a nearby new building after PWD authorities declared it unsafe. She added that though they face space shortage, as the new building has only two rooms, they have ensured safety of students. 
 
 A GMS student said they feel scared to sit in the classes, especially during rainy season when the roofs leak. 
 
 Swaranjeet Kaur, district education officer (secondary), said, “I will get the status of the building checked. For us, safety of students is paramount and we will explore all options if the building is unsafe.”
