 In his concluding remarks during discussions on demands for grants in the budget in the revenue sector for the financial year 2018-2019, the revenue minister also pointed out that the government could recover a total of 195.13 hectares of encroached land in 602 cases during the same period.
 
 “Unconditional title deeds were given to occupants of 16,650 hectares of land in the state as per the   (Regularisation of Occupation of Forest Lands prior to 1-1-1977) Special Rules 1993. In Idukki alone, title deeds were given for 15,000 hectares of forest land,” the minister said.
  
  
 On the revenue lands illegally occupied by religious communities, libraries, clubs and crematoriums, Chandrasekharan said they can continue occupying a minimum size of land on a long-term lease or by purchasing the holdings at market price. “A recommendation has already been submitted to the government for making a policy decision,” he said.
 
 The minister said 55   were placed under suspension during the period after they were found guilty of corruption and dereliction of duty. Disciplinary actions were also taken against 165 others on various grounds, he said.
 
 On the ordinance introduced for strengthening the  , Chandrasekharan said the Bill will be placed for discussion to decide on a cut-off date for lands reclaimed before 2008, considering the difficulty in acquiring satellite data on them.

 Elaborating on the department’s modernisation initiatives, the revenue minister said 60 more   will be set up in addition to the existing 39. “Out of the total 1,664 village offices, 1,500 have been equipped with online systems. Front offices will be established at 50-60 village offices on an experimental basis. Plans are also on to set up a comprehensive revenue portal,” the minister said.
 
 The cabinet, he said, has already given approval for five out of the six new revenue divisions announced in the last budget (2017-18), on which a notification will be issued after deciding on the headquarters. They will start functioning in two months’ time, he added.
