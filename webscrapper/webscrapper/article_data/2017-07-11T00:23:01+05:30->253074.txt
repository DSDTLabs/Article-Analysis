Aurangabad: A  , belonging to Kannad taluka of Aurangabad district, was recently acquitted by a district and sessions court of charges of murdering his wife in 2013.

 According to the prosecution, the farmer’s wife — identified as Bijlabai Pawar (30), a resident of Borsar village in Aurangabad — was admitted to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) for burn injuries around 11.50pm on May 20, 2013.
 
 In her statement, the victim had stated that recently she had an altercation with her husband when they went to attend a marriage. When they came back, the accused asked her to cook dinner.
 
 When the dinner was served, the husband, Pandharinath Pawar, started abusing the victim over shortage of food. This led to an altercation and in a fit of rage, the accused poured kerosene on his wife and set her on fire.
 
 The neighbours, hearing the woman’s scream, came to the rescue and took her to the GMCH. She had sustained serious burn injuries and died during treatment the next day. Pawar was arrested under Section 302 and other sections of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 However, S G Ladda, who represented the accused, argued that the woman’s saree accidentally caught fire while she was cooking food. “Following the arguments, additional sessions judge Uttam L Telgaonkar concluded that the prosecution could not prove the accused had committed the crime and thus acquitted him,” said Ladda.
