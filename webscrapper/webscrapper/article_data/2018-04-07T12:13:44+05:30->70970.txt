BHUBANESWAR: BJD president and chief minister   on Friday rubbished BJP president  's allegations that the government has neglected the western part of the state. 

 Responding to media queries on Shah's claim,   said, "A number of development works is being done for all-round development of the region."
 
 On Shah's assertion that the BJP would win more than 120 seats in the next assembly election, Naveen said he does not see any base behind such claims.
 
 BJD vice-president and former minister Debi Prasad   said the entire state is one region for them. "Be it Biju Expressway, irrigation projects, medical colleges or other infrastructure projects, western Odisha has always been a focus area for the state government," Mishra said. 
 
 On Thursday Shah had slammed the state government for supposed lack of development in western Odisha, believed to be a traditional BJP bastion. The BJP president also spoke about the imbalance between western and coastal districts on issues like irrigation and drinking water.
 
 Meanwhile, with elections barely a year away, Naveen started the exercise of putting the house in order. On Friday he engaged with the grass roots leaders in Koraput district through video conferencing from the BJD headquarters to take stock of the party organisation.
 
 "Naveen spoke to the core group of the ward committees from at least 14 blocks and four civic bodies of Koraput district. He enquired about the implementation of the party's people connect programmes in both urban and rural areas. He also advised them to connect with the people and to ensure that various welfare schemes reaches them," Mishra said after the meeting.
 
 Sources said the chief minister would continue such engagements with grass roots leaders of all districts for the next three to four months. 
 
 Naveen had conducted a similar exercise after last year's rural polls, wherein he had met the elected members of the panchayati raj institution.
