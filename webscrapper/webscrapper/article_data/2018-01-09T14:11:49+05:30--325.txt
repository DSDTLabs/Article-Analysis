PATNA: Patnaites, trying to get their kids admitted to Mary Ward Kindergarten — the Montessori unit of St Joseph’s Convent High School — experienced a nightmare of sorts while filling up and submitting admission forms on Monday. Many, who failed to do so, were on the verge of tears.

 One of the parents,  , alleged that the school administration did not accept her form. She said, “This school was my first preference as my house is nearby. The authorities should have given us at least a day’s time to fill up the forms. I can’t wait for another year and will apply in other prominent schools of the city.” 
 
 Many parents who submitted the admission forms successfully, had been standing in long queues since morning. Kankarbagh resident Anu Singh said, “My home is far away and I reached the school around 7am. As soon as the form counter opened around 8.30am, hundreds of parents could be seen on the school campus.”
 
 Bailey Road resident Latvia heaved a sigh of relief as she “made it on time”. “My turn at the counter came just a few minutes before it was shut at 11.30am. I hope my kid performs well in the interview on January 10.”
 
 The 165-year-old St Joseph’s Convent is one of the most preferred educational institutes for girls. More than 1,000 forms were sold for 240 seats at the school counter between 8am and 11.30am.
 
 Mt Carmel High School forms will be available at the website www.patnacarmel.com on January 10 and January 11. The portal will be open between 9am to 6pm. 
 
 Notre   is yet to release the date of admissions. However, a source claimed that the forms would be available from the second week of January.
 
 St Xavier’s High School has also started selling LKG admission forms from Monday and will continue the process till January 21. The forms are available only on the website www.stxavierspatna.in. 
 
 At   High School, the forms will be available at the school counter on January 13 and January 14.
