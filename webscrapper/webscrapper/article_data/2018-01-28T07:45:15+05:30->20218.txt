BENGALURU: Facing flak from the BJP and other quarters, the state government on Saturday withdrew the controversial letter which sought opinion of police officers about dropping cases filed against persons of a minority community during communal riots in 2013-17.

 Home minister Ramalinga   said it was a clerical mistake and it had led to some confusion. He said a new letter had been issued to replace it.
 
 In the letter and a reminder written on December 22, 2017 and January 2, 2018 respectively,   had sought the opinion of the senior police officers of the state about the withdrawal of cases against innocent persons from a minority community.
 
  In another letter written on Thursday, the   asked top officers of the districts to immediately let him know their views on the issue.
 
 The earlier letter had used the words "innocent minorities". The new letter has dropped the word 'minorities'. However, the tenor of the letter remains the same as it is in response to recommendations made by the  , which said innocent minorities booked in communal cases should be freed.
 
 "It was a clerical mistake to print the word "minorities". However, the Rajendra Sachar Committee says there are many innocent minorities on whom false cases have been booked. Though the reminder talks about minorities in particular, our government is open to all. Any person booked wrongly during any mob violence, including communal, can approach us, seeking removal of his or her name," he said.
