Manoj Bajpayee, who was admitted to a suburban hospital in Mumbai for tests following complaints of continuous headaches, was discharged on Thursday around noon. The actor was under observation for a night and test reports indicated that high blood pressure was the cause of the recurring migraines.

  
  
  His general practitioner, Dr. Vishesh Agrawal, conferred with the team in the hospital and they concurred on a change of medication. After they had advised him to focus on his health under control, Manoj was discharged.
 
 The actor reportedly flew to London yesterday for the schedule of Neeraj Pandey's 'Aiyaary', which also features   as his protégé. Based on a true incident, the intense crime-drama revolves around two strong-minded army officers who have completely different views but both are right in their own way. Neeraj's 'A Wednesday' actor,  , also joined the duo recently.
 
 After a seven-day schedule in Kashmir, the unit moved to Delhi. They will be shooting in Mumbai, London and Oman too. According to a source, the actor was not keen to postpone his London travel date because he didn't wish to inconvenience the production. His wife Neha and daughter Ava have flown with him to the UK.
