Chandigarh: A counsel appearing for the castrated sadhus (disciples) of   Sacha Sauda urged the CBI magistrate on Saturday to pass an order to conceal their identity during the trial inside and outside the court. The counsel representing the sadhus said the arguments had been completed and the CBI magistrate was about to give his directions.

 Meanwhile, in a related development, Dr M P Singh and Dr Pankaj Garg appeared in the CBI court and rape convict dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh appeared through videoconferencing.
 
 The court hearing follows the CBI challan on February 1, naming Gurmeet as the prime accused in the alleged forced castration of nearly 400 disciples with the help of Dr Garg and Dr Singh, who were employed at a hospital inside the Sirsa-based dera.
 
 CBI has charged Gurmeet and two others with sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 416 (cheating by personation) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC. The agency began probing the matter in 2015 on the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court after hearing a petition filed by dera chiefâ€™s former follower Hans Raj Chauhan in July 2012.
