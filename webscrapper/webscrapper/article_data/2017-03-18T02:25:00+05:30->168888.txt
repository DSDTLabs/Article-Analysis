MUMBAI: A committee of the   legislature has found violations in the development of Lavasa and directed the government to recover dues. 

 The public accounts committee headed by Congress leader Gopaldas Aggarwal has also passed strictures against the state government and its officials for overlooking irregularities in the project despite several complaints. 
 
 The report mentions that there is a “violation of permission” for construction. The permission has been granted for only 2,000 hectares by the state environment department, the   Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has granted consent for construction on 6,181.37 hectares, which was against the rules. 
 
 The report has also passed strictures against Pune collector for favouring   (LCL), the PAC has suggested recovering nearly Rs 4 crore from LCL. “There have been many violations and as there is no clarity in government while applying penalty and hence the Pune collector should seek guidance from the law and judicial department,” the report stated.
 
 The state had given its permission on the condition that construction cannot be done above a 1,000m height, the LCL has breached the permissible limit without the Union ministry of environment and forest’s consent, mentioned the report. The committee also asked the Pune collector to ensure if his department has fixed the entertainment tax properly against LCL, which had not taken prior permission before starting water games and other sports.
