GURUGRAM: MCG has collected Rs 3 crore in property   from 40   across the city in March.

 According to officials, besides these, six more banquet halls have to pay   dues for 2018-19. Another eight banquet halls were not found at their addresses during an inspection. 
 
 “Several banquet halls were running but have now shut down. They owe property taxes for the period that they were operational. We will start tracking such properties and collecting such dues,” said MCG commissioner  .
 
 As of now, nine banquet halls have been sealed till owners make due payments, said the MCG officials. Additionally, property tax payments have to be made even for empty plots which have been allotted for banquet halls.
