GORAKHPUR: Facing opposition flak for holding  , chief minister Aditya Nath   on Saturday vehemently defended the event and said that “hosting mahotsavas is not a monopoly of one family”. He also dismissed the allegations that exorbitant amount of government funds were spent on the event.

 “Many people are used to criticizing even good things. Gorakhpur Mahotsava is not an event of any one family, but a festival of people and society. The right to hold such mahotsavas does not rest with any one village or people?,” said Yogi at the closing ceremony of the threeday Gorakhpur Mahotsava on Saturday.
 
 The chief minister said that many people are comparing Gorakhpur Mahotsava and the ‘other’ mahotsava which is wrong. “That mahotsava was fullof ‘hullarbazi’ (hooliganism), while this festival is pious, disciplined and within limits. This is about our identity. Those who believe in Baba Gorakhnath, Bhagwan Buddha and the tradition of freedom fighters, participated in the festival on their own,” he said.
 
 Yogi defended holding of Gorakhpur Mahotsava and congratulatedorganizers for conducting it successfully.
