 award winner and writer-columnist Taarak Mehta (87), passed away in  , recently. The writer, who became hugely popular for his Gujarati column, Duniya Ne Undha Chasma, had a lot of his work adapted into several Gujarati plays. It also inspired the makers of popular TV show, Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah. The show has been running for the last 10 years now.
Recalling how he got inspired by the writer’s columns, poducer Asit Kumarr Modi says, “Though the screenplay and dialogues are something that the show’s entire team should take credit for, I cannot deny how his columns actually led me to make a show for the TV audiences. We had to adapt the whole concept for TV and make changes accordingly.”
  Lodha, who plays Taarak Mehta in the show, is yet to read the writer’s columns because he does not know how to read Gujarati. He also admits that he did not know much about the writer, till the producer introduced him to his world of humour and rich Gujarati literature. Shailesh says, “It is only thanks to Asit Kumarr, that I was educated about Taarak Mehta’s work and his humorous columns. We used to share a secret smile with each other, whenever he came on the sets. He used to see me enact his character in the show. We connected instantly when he came on the sets of the show inspired by his column. I feel that creative individuals like him never die because their work will continue to inspire us. Future generations too will read his columns.” 
 There is an interesting tidbit about how the lead character,   got his name. The eminent writer used to address one of his best friends,   as Jethalal in his columns.
