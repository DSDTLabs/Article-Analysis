 Describing the announcement to charge Rs 150 on every transaction for cash deposits and withdrawals beyond four free transactions in a month as unfair on customers, the traders urged Union finance minister Arun Jaitely to intervene and advise banks to withdraw the decision immediately. 
 
 “We have appealed to the finance minister to ensure the decision is withdrawn immediately in the larger interest of the traders and entrepreneurs,” said Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) president  . 
 
 Further terming the decision as a financial tyranny, the traders’ body mentioned there is a whiff of conspiracy to rob the people of their hard earned money. Entrepreneur Vijay Anand Moonka said a practice if followed by any other group of industries would have come under the ambit of the Monopoly and Restrictive Trade Practice and the Competition Commission of India would have come into action. 
 
 Reacting to the decision, entrepreneur Santosh Khetan said, “Needless to say we are being unduly charged for being in the banking system.” 
 
 The Jamshedpur Hoteliers’ Association (JHA) functionary, Prabhakar Singh, said, “The government should realise we can only be a less-cash society and not a totally cashless society.”
