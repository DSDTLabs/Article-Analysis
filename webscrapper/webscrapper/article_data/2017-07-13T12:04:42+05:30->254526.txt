CHANDIGARH: Not in favour of the fixing of garbage-collection charges, former   minister and MP   said here on Wednesday that the municipal corporation’s hiring private companies for door-to-door waste collection will force the people to pay extra.

 Under the two-bin waste segregation scheme launched in June, the   is supposed to distribute 10,000 pairs of green and blue dustbins of 12-litre capacity, besides collecting garbage from every door. “The corporation has fixed a high price for garbage collection from houses, shops, and institutions,”   said. 
 
 “Why pay more after house tax and sewerage cess etc.? For what purpose are the proceeds being utilised? Isn’t the GST (goods and services tax) taking its toll on citizens enough that the MC wants to burden them with even the garbage-collection charges? The MC is supposed to work for the welfare of the residents, not to burden them with levies,” Bansal said.
