Nashik: The city is all set to celebrate   — birthday of Lord Rama — on April 4. Since it is believed that Lord Rama had lived in Nashik for few years during his exile, Ram Navami is one of the most celebrated and awaited festivals of Nashik.

 The biggest celebration will be held in Nashik’s prominent Kalaram Mandir.
 
  “Traditional celebration will be held in Kalaram temple this year as well. The day will start with a prayer to the sun. As Lord Rama is believed to be born at 12 noon, a special prayer is performed at this time,” said Pandurang Bodke, senior trustee of the Kalaram temple.
 
 Thousands of devotees visit the temple throughout the day and many observe fast and take holy dip in the Godavari River. Celebrations will also be held in other temples in Panchvati, Old City, CIDCO and Deolali area. Nearby villages like Chandori and Niphad have their own traditions and rituals to celebrate this occasion.
 
 The third day from Ram Navami, April 07 marks the chariot processions of Ram and Garuda raths from Kalaram temple. The procession route of the Ram Rath is around the temple, whereas the Garuda Rath is moved from the Kalaram temple – Ganesh Wadi – across the sacred Godavari River – Dahipool – RK – Panchvati – back to the Kalaram temple. Both the chariots are ready for the annual procession.
 
 Shirdi decked up for devotees: Shri Saibaba Samadhi temple in Shirdi will also celebrate Ram Navami traditionally and has invited artists to stage various programmes on Sainagar ground every evening from April 2. Devotees interested to participate in ‘Akahand Parayan’ need to enroll their names on April 2 between 1pm and 5.30pm at the temple office.
