PILIBHIT: Pilibhit police district has got 18 new two-wheeler police response vehicles (PRVs) from the   police administration. Superintendent of police (SP)   flagged off the bikes at the district police headquarters on Sunday.
 
  Naithani told mediapersons, “PRVs have been allotted to different police stations in accordance with their area of command and crime rate.”
  
  “The vehicles will have access to narrow streets of urban and rural areas, where a four-wheeler generally cannot reach. The bikes are linked to UP’s 100 control room in Lucknow through highly sophisticated integrated connectivity system, and will immediately reach to the person with distress with help on getting information,” he said.
  
  Each PRV with two cops will function in three shifts of eight hours.
  
  The SP said the bikes would strengthen policing and help in maintaining law and order in the district.
  
  The district was originally approved 19 Dial-100 bikes, of which 18 were made available. Pilibhit Kotwali and Sungarhi police stations of Pilibhit city have been provided three bikes each, Neuria, Bisalpur, Puranpur and   police stations have been allotted two bikes each, while Amaria, Jahanabad, Barkhera and Bilsanda police stations get one bike each.
  
  “Dia-100 bike in-charge Rahamt Khan has also been given a bike to review and ensure prompt mobility of PRVs,” Naithani said.
