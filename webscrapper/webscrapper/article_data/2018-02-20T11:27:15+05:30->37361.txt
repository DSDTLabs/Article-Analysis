Reality TV star and model   says she has always been a hypochondriac.

 In an episode of " ", the 22-year-old said that she doesn't even like going out of the house any more. She also admitted opening up about her feelings was the first step to dealing with them.
 
 She was quoted saying, "Since I was a kid, I've always been a hypochondriac. I've always been the worst hypochondriac. But now I have to try and be a big girl."
 
 The reality TV star had hundreds of dollars of jewellery stolen from her home last year, while her older sister   West was robbed at gunpoint in Paris in 2016, and all that has contributed to Kendall feeling unsafe.
 
 "There's a lot that happened this past year, starting with like, Kim's robbery. Then I got robbed, and I had my stalkers. That's why I don't really like going out anymore. That's why I don't tweet, that's why I don't Instagram. That gives me anxiety, too. I swear, it's the craziest thing", she continued.
