Television anchor, radio jockey and actor   is on cloud nine. Having rebooted her fondness for fitness a few years ago, Ramya has been participating in several fitness championships and winning medals at the district level. The latest addition to her wins is the bronze medal she won at the State Level Powerlifting Competition for Benchpress, on Sunday. 

 An elated Ramya says, “I have been doing powerlifting for the last seven months. I was participating in district-level championships for benchpress and squat, and have won   medals. My trainer Jyotsna kept encouraging me to take up powerlifting. Many women, especially from our state, think twice before going for powerlifting. Some feel that they can’t do it, while a few others worry about their body structure changing. I wanted to break that myth and began training. In the district-level competitions, I had less than 10 people competing with me. I felt that I didn’t train enough for the state-level event. When I went for the event, there were around 20-25 people competing for the title. Initially, I was a bit scared to participate. But then, I decided to give it a shot and gave it my all. I was surprised to learn that I came third, winning a bronze medal, and qualifying for the nationals.” 
 
 Ramya wants more women to do powerlifting, “I want to motivate more women to get into powerlifting. Beating state-level competitors is no easy business. Having said that, competing in this tournament motivated and boosted my confidence. I want more women to experience this adrenaline high. Though I am qualified for the nationals, I want to take this slow. I want to work and train harder before representing my state in the nationals.”
