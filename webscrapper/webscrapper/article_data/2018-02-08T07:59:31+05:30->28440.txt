Any person who believes in the ideology of the Congress party can come for the interview and selection procedure. No one will be eliminated because we believe that each person has a different talent,” Doshi said.

 Through the talent hunt, Congress is looking for good orators, experts in social media, RTI activists, content writers, graphic designers, spokespersons and panellists.
 
 “If one hasn’t sent an application, it still won’t be a problem. A person who wants to contribute and work for the Congress party can come to the PCC office, fill a form and walk-in for the discussion with us,” Manish Doshi said.
 
 Thursday’s talent search will commence with an orientation programme followed by the selection of party spokespersons at district and state levels.
