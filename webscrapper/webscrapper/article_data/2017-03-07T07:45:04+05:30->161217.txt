CHENNAI: Residents of some southern suburbs in the city were forced to go without water on Monday after the   went on strike over officials detaining five vehicles for drawing water from agricultural land. 

 The tankers had been collecting water from unused wells on agricultural land in the area and selling it to apartment complexes, IT   and colleges. On Monday, Pallavaram resident Manohar Lewis said, water was only supplied to hotels and business establishments. "The impact will be felt on Tuesday if the tankers continue the strike," he said. 
 
 N Nijalingam, president of the association, said tankers would not distribute water in places like Chromepet, Pallavaram, Zamin Pallavaram, Chitlapakkam and Sembakkam. 
 
 In the southern suburbs, where Palar water is supplied only once a week, many residents sollely depend on private tankers.
 
 Activist and Chromepet resident V Santhanam said residents of apartment complexes would particularly suffer in the next two to three days.
 
 "There are not many wells in the suburbs and even borewells have gone dry. The strike should make the authorities act tough to protect water bodies from being plundered by the tanker mafia," he said.
