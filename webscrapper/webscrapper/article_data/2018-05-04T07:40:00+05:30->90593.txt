Mohali:   reported the highest road accident fatality rate — deaths per million population — in the state in 2017.

 Even as Ludhiana topped the list of highest number of road accident deaths in Punjab (536) last year, the fatality rate in Mohali district was double than the Punjab average. According to Navdeep Asija, Punjab traffic adviser and road activist who has prepared the 2017 report on road accidents in state, last year Mohali was at number one in fatality rate with 261 deaths per million, followed by Ropar with 252, Nawanshahr with 196, Patiala with 176 and Fatehgarh Sahib with 169. The fatality rate in Ludhiana was 141.
 
 The reason is less population and high number of fatal accidents in Mohali district. 
 
 Asija said, “We have prepared fatality rate rankings and Mohali tops the chart. It means driving on Mohali   is riskier and most dangerous in Punjab.”
