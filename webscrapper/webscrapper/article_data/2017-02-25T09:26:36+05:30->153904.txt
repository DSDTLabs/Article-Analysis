CUTTACK: Concerned over the   of   by youngsters, the   have decided to launch   here from March. 

 Police said the awareness camps will not be an one-time affair but will be regularly organized in schools. 
 
 The initiative aims to encourage children to refrain from underage driving. Traffic officials will educate children about the consequences of driving without proper license being a crime that can invite jail terms too. This apart, road safety lessons will also be imparted to these children. They will be acquainted with traffic signs, signals and speed limit.
 
 Traffic police officials said on an average around 280 to 300 accidents are recorded in Cuttack annually and in 35% to 40% cases minor and young drivers/riders are involved. The issue of underage driving was discussed at length at the traffic management committee meeting. "The underage drivers not only risk their lives but also pose threat to the lives of other commuters," said ACP traffic P K Dalai. "We will discuss the matter with school authorities and decide the time and date for the awareness programme. We want to organize it after examinations so that children can listen to us with a relaxed mind," said a traffic officer.
 
 On a priority basis, such awareness programmes will be carried out in private English-medium schools as it has been noticed that majority of students in these schools ride two-wheelers. 
 
 Along with students, teachers and parents will also be told about the dangers and risks of underage driving. Senior traffic officials said many parents allow their minor children to go to school in two-wheelers and even school authorities do not restrict them. The police also intend to appeal to school authorities to put up notices in their institutions against underage driving.
