Greater Noida: In an innovative effort to prevent crimes like theft, police have set up a   in Sector Alpha 1, doling out details of nearly 40 thieves and requesting residents to inform police if they spot any of them.

 The suspects are in the age group of 20 to 45, and were involved in thefts of vehicles, laptops and burglary.
 
 Jitendra Kumar Bhati, president,  , Alpha–1, said the residents held a meeting with the officers of Kasna police station and discussed ways to curb theft cases. “The police have improved patrolling in the area. We have also asked our security guards to be more active. The police officers shared the photos of suspects who were arrested in the past in different cases of thefts. The residents should see the photos and inform police once we spot a suspect in the sector,” Bhati said. He said that last week two cars were stolen from the sector.
 
 The strategy is aimed at controlling crime by focusing on early identification and timely intervention. 
 
 Sudhir  , SHO, Kasna police station, said that police usually make a dossier of criminals who are arrested. “We have observed that these criminals come out on bail and again get involved in crimes. In the new initiative, people can help police by sharing information on time and thereby prevent crime,” he said.
 
 The concept originates from community policing, where police and citizens mutually share the responsibility for improving safety and security in a sector. The police officials are also spending considerable time and effort in developing and maintaining relationships with citizens and community organizations.
 
 According to Tyagi, the police are in talks with more residents and other RWAs for displaying names of suspects in other sectors as well.
 
 Sujata Singh, SP (rural), held a meeting with residents last month where she stressed on the need for residents to cooperate with police for improved safety and security.
