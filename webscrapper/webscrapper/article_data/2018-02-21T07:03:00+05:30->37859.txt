Ludhiana: Even though there are only few green spaces and stretches in the city, none of the political party or candidate fighting Ludhiana MC election till recently talked about methods to give city’s green lungs a fresh lease of life in their election agenda.

 The issues like water supply, sewerage, roads and streetlights feature in the agenda of the parties, but the decreasing green cover had not caught anyone’s attention.
 
 Importantly, a survey has found that the city is left with just 7% tree cover. Though the area-wise percentage is higher in residential areas, the problem is severe in industrial areas.
 
 Now after the survey results have come out in the open, party leaders claim that they would work towards a green Ludhiana.
 
 BJP district president Ravinder Arora said ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ and ‘Clean India, Green India’ are their main agendas and they would definitely focus on development of parks as well. He said their party candidates will work on increasing the green cover of the city.
 
 SAD candidate from ward number 3 Ninderjit Kaur said persons can live without roads and streetlights, but not without water supply and fresh air. Therefore, her main agenda is to provide these two things to the common public. She said she would develop more green spaces in her ward for covering the loss.
 
 Congress candidate from ward number 5 Manisha Sehgal however said MC elections are mainly about very basic things like water supply, sewerage, roads and streetlights, but she would give equal importance to developing green spaces in the city. She said that they would try to develop every possible vacant land as green stretches of the city.
 
 Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) candidate Gurpreet Khurana said in his ward there is hardly any space for the plantation due to narrow lanes and wall-to-wall construction. He said he wanted to develop the green belts in the area as well and this time if he gets a chance, they will plant saplings wherever possible.
