CHANDIGARH: A Class XII student, who was under the influence of liquor, allegedly assaulted a woman teacher of a government school after the latter asked him to leave the school’s lobby on Thursday.

 The boy fled the school soon after the incident.
 
 The teacher was punched in the face and was left bleeding from the nose when she was taken to a hospital.
 
 A police complaint in this regard was given by the teacher. Copy of the DDR was with TOI.
 
 Narrating the incident, the JBT teacher claimed that she was asking students to vacate the lobby outside Class XI when the boy first misbehaved with her. “He was sitting in the lobby when I asked him to go to his class. But said he will not go whatever I say.”
 
 She then called male teachers. He tried to flee, but was caught and was taken to the principal. “The principal called his parents and said his name would be struck off as he had misbehaved with teachers earlier too. When she said they will take him for a medical examination to check whether he was drunk or not, he ran out of the school,” she said.
 
 Almost half an hour later, the boy returned to take revenge with the teacher. “I was standing with another teacher when he appeared all of a sudden and punched me in the face and I started bleeding. By the time others came, he had run away.”
 
 She said he had something sharp in his hand which is why she suffered a small cut on her face.
 
 After filing a complaint with the police, the teacher also filed a complaint with the education secretary and other officials of education department,   and sought strict action against the student.
