Ludhiana: Plywood manufacturers of the state have hiked the rates of plywood, plyboard and flush doors by 6%.

 Ashok Juneja, chairman, Punjab Plywood Manufacturers Association (PPMA), said the rates have been hiked due to rising costs and the decision to hike rates was unanimously passed in a meeting of All India Plywood Manufacturers Association (AIPMA) which was held in Delhi recently.
 
 In the meeting, it was decided to appoint Ludhiana businessman and president of PPMA as the head of the dispute settlement committee of AIPMA.
 
 Speaking to TOI over the issue of hike in prices of plywood and allied products, Juneja said, “We have been forced to hike the rates of plywood, plyboard and flush doors due to the huge rise in costs of production on account of rise in labour and raw material. Our industry has already suffered huge losses and it was becoming impossible to absorb any further losses.”
 
 “This hike is not applicable in Punjab alone, in fact the rates have been hiked in entire country by plywood manufacturers and dealers,” Juneja said, adding, “In addition to the rising costs, GST was imposed in India with promise to abolish all kinds of other taxes, and fees but still the market committee fee in Punjab is being levied and has not been withdrawn. Therefore we request the state government to immediately issue orders regarding the same.”
 
 Inderjit Singh Sohal, a businessman, “Recently, our businesses have taken a hit with several units shutting down due to huge losses. We were not left with no other option but to hike the rate of our products by 6%, which is marginal increase as far as our losses are concerned. We have also decided that no credit will be given beyond 30 days to any dealer.”
