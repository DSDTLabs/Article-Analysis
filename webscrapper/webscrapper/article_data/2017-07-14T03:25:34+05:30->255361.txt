Mumbai: Seven years after a 35-year-old senior sales manager died in a head-on collision with an ST bus on the   highway, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation will pay a compensation of over Rs 1.39 crore to his family.

 In a judgment pronounced last week, the   said there was no evidence to show that the victim, Punit Dogra, was guilty of contributory negligence and was driving rashly. The tribunal concluded that the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the ST bus driver.
 
 The accident took place on June 7, 2010, when Punit was driving his jeep on the Mumbai-Goa highway. Near Mangaon in  , the speeding ST bus coming from the opposite direction rammed into the jeep. Punit suffered severe injuries and was rushed to the   at Nagothane. He was later shifted to a private hospital where he was declared dead.
 
 On September 9, 2010, Dogra’s widow  , parents Pratap and Aruna and son Rudra, then four years old, submitted an application before the tribunal.
 
 MSRTC denied the allegations and pinned the blame on the victim’s alleged negligence. In its support, an alleged eyewitness also deposed before the tribunal. The man claimed that Dogra was driving rashly, in a zigzag manner. He further claimed that the jeep came on the wrong side of the road and collided with the bus. However, the tribunal said this was not proved. 
 
 Relying on the FIR, where the bus driver was named an accused, the tribunal said it had no reason to disbelieve and discard the police papers brought on record. “There is no reason for the police to unnecessarily implicate any person or employee in a criminal case. Said police papers speak for themselves as far as involvement of vehicle that MSRTC bus in accident is concerned,” the tribunal said.
 
 The tribunal decided on the compensation amount by taking into account Dogra’s age, his average monthly salary of Rs 43,000, future earning capacity and loss of love and affection suffered by the family.
