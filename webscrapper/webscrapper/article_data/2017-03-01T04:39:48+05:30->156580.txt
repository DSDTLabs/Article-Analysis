Surat: Over 1,000 branches of nationalized banks in south Gujarat, including 200 in Surat, remained closed on Tuesday in response to the nationwide strike called by   (UFBU) to press for acceptance of its various demands by the government like salary revision, trade union rights, etc.

 The banking operations in south Gujarat were hit to some extent as 20,000 employees, including officers, of nationalized banks stayed away from work. HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank,   and other private and cooperative banks were open yet clearing of Rs 500 crore worth cheques could not take place in the region due to the one-day bandh, sources said.
 
 Gustad Wadia, a bank union leader, said, “Demonetization had created difficulties for bank employees. The NPA problem has only increased. The government should declare the names of wilful defaulters.”
 
  leader Vasant Barot said, “Wage is an issue but we are also worried because of merger of State Bank of India with its associate banks on April 1. This will take away at least one lakh jobs across India. The managements of associate banks of SBI have offered voluntary retirement to their employees. But we want more jobs and not this.”
