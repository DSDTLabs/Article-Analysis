Ludhiana: The Swacch Bharat Swacch Dhan campaign of office of chief commissioner of income tax (CCIT) — which was organized on Thursday in Ludhiana — is likely to enter the record books soon, disclosed CCIT Ludhiana, Binay K Jha.

 Speaking to mediapersons at the income tax department’s office, he said: “The previous record of any mass awareness campaign was made in Bengaluru, where 18,000 people participated in the campaign, but in our Swacch Bharat Swacch Dhan campaign conducted today (Thursday), we covered 408 public, 148 private, and 82 convent schools, and more than four lakh students took part in it, with data of 2.28 lakh already verified by our officials, which is almost 20 times the record made in Bengaluru. So, we can say we have already made a record, but we will declare it only when it is confirmed officially.”
 
 Jha also added: “Our campaign was being closely monitored by record registering companies, and by tomorrow (Friday), we will have the exact figures of how many people we have been able to reach through this massive campaign of ours. Once we have the final figures, we will submit these to Limca Book of Records and Guinness Book of World records as well with proofs.”
 
 Speaking about the plantation drive conducted by the department on Thursday in association with TOI under its Live Green campaign, Jha said school students showed a great deal of interest and enthusiasm, and hundreds of neem saplings were planted by teams of the department visiting the schools. These tax trees, named Apnakar trees, have been adopted by schools, and will now be looked after by students who will share the progress of these on the portal www.apnakar.com.
 
 Other officials present on the occasion included principal commissioners R Bhama and Jagtar Singh, commissioners Pirthi Lal, Alok Kumar, Devender, additional commissioner Rohit Mehra, joint commissioner Manav Bansal, and deputy commissioners Prem Malik and Kamaldeep.
