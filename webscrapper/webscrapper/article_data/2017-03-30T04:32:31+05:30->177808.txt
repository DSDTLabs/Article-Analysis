NEW DELHI: The next time you fly to Goa, be prepared for a longer wait than usual. The   (BCAS) announced on Wednesday that private ground handlers will no longer be allowed to work at defence airfields.

 Goa’s   employs three private ground handlers and a subsidiary of   for work like x-raying check-in bags, loading/unloading luggage, and attaching stepladders to aircrafts. Sources said the airline industry could take up the issue with authorities in Delhi as the absence of private firms could lead to a sudden crunch of ground staff at the busy airport.
 
 “...only airlines’ own staff or the AI subsidiary will do the job. The volume of business is so high that passengers will feel the crunch,” a source said.
 
 Last year, the airport had cited security concerns and directed that only the AI subsidiary will handle charter flights. In January 2017,   authorities asked the AI subsidiary to get ready to do the job of the other three ground handling agencies.
