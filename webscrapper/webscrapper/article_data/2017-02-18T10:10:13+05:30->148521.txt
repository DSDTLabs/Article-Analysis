PATNA: A receiver appointed by the Bombay high court on Friday attached the premises of Priyadarshi Motors near Saguna Mor under the Danapur police station area in Patna.

 The attachment was ordered by the HC in connection with non-payment of loan taken from the Tata Financial by showroom proprietor Nikhil Priyadarshi. The HC had earlier issued a warrant of arrest against Nikhil, which could not be executed. Hence the property attachment order, sources said.
 
 Nikhil is the son of retired IAS official Krishna Bihari Prasad Sinha of Jharkhand cadre. Nikhil is also absconding in a case of alleged sexual exploitation of a minor daughter of a former Bihar minister belonging to Congress, police said.
 
 Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said three officials from Mumbai with the help of Patna Police attached the showroom with several four-wheelers inside it.
 
 A POCSO (Protection of children from sexual offences) special court of judge Pervez Alam on February 7 rejected the anticipatory bail petition of Nikhil’s father, brother   and friend Sanjeet Kumar Sharma in connection with the sexual exploitation case lodged with the SC/ST police station in Patna on December 22 last year. Even they are yet to be arrested.
 
 “Nikhil’s anticipatory bail petition is likely to come up for hearing before the special POCSO court on Saturday. Another Congress leader Brajesh Pandey’s role has also surfaced during police investigation in the sexual exploitation case. He is also absconding,” special public prosecutor   told TOI, adding the girl in her statement alleged Nikhil, Sanjeet and Brajesh had been running a sex racket.
 
 CID IG (weaker section)   has formed an SIT (special investigation team) to arrest Nikhil and others in the case.
