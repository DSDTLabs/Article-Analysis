VADODARA: This is not for the first time that the   Refinery has had a brush with the Gujarat Pollution Control Board ( ). 

 In June 2010, a major fire broke out in the backyard of the refinery plant in Karachiya village. 
 
 Though there were no casualties, GPCB inquiry had revealed that tonnes of bitumen was dumped by the refinery in their own plot. The bitumen caught fire that spread panic in the village. The GPCB had issued a notice to the refinery and asked it to clean up the entire plot and stop dumping any products there. 
 
 In November 2011, the refinery plant again came under the scanner for releasing its oil sludge in the   that flows into  . 
 
 The incident came to light after huge flames erupted from Mini River near   as the sludge that had gathered over the river caught fire. 
 
 GPCB had said that refinery was allowed to use the storm water drain during monsoon but the company used the drain to dispose its effluents that eventually piled up in the river. 
 
 Local villagers too had complained of air pollution and skin infection due to water used from Mini River. 
 
 Refinery management, though, had rejected the charge and said that its effluent is disposed through effluent treatment plant and only water is released in the storm water drain.
