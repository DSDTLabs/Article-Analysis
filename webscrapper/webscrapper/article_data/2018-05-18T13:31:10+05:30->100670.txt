CHANDRAPUR: Yet another student, Vikas Soyam, from the tribal ashram school here scaled Mount Everest in the early hours of Thursday. He becomes the fifth among the 10-member tribal student expedition from Chandrapur to successfully scale the highest summit in the world over the last two days.

 The 10-member group of tribal students from three different tribal ashram schools from the district was sent on Mission Shourya to scale Mount Everest. Four of the 10-member group had scaled the tallest mountain on Wednesday morning. 21-year old Vikas Soyam began his summit climb on Wednesday night. He took the same route (from the north side of summit) as taken by his four pals to reach the pinnacle at 4.55am, said district collector Ashutosh Salil. Soyam is a Std XII student at   at Jiwti on Manikgarh Hillocks.
 
 Salil said that the students are given different slots to attempt the peak with other mountaineers. Four students had made the attempt on Tuesday night and reached the summit on Wednesday morning, whereas Vikas started on Wednesday night and had reached the pinnacle the following morning.
 
 Indu Kannake, the sixth member of the group, will make her attempt on the summit on Thursday night and if successful, she will reach the summit in the early hours of Friday, collector Salil added. The remaining four members of the group, Chayya Atram, Akash Madavi, Subham Pendor and  , were adjudged unfit to scale the summit due to altitude sickness and are headed back home.
 
 The remaining six-member team, after Indu Kannakeâ€™s attempt, will head back home via Kathmandu, Delhi and Mumbai. Sources claimed that the successful students are likely to reach Kathmandu on May 24 or 25. Authorities are taking efforts to organize a meeting of the tribal students with the President and Prime Minister at Delhi during their return journey. The students will also meet governor of Maharashtra and chief minister   at Mumbai before returning home to Chandrapur.
