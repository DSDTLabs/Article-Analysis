Trichy: Even as the disappointment over damage made to a newly-laid portion of Collector Office Road is yet to die down, yet another stretch in the city was damaged for erecting a political hoarding on Friday. This time, a portion of the VOC road behind Central bus stand was dug up to install a life-size banner reportedly at the behest of a political party organising a meeting nearby.

 The Trichy Corporation in October 2017 had sanctioned Rs 11.65 crore towards road works as the arterial roads were in a bad shape. Between January and March 2018, as many as 38 road works were completed by the civic body and few others including Racquet Court lane are underway even as questions were raised about the quality of works as new roads deviate away from the standards of Indian Roads Congress (IRC). 
 
 Two weeks after TOI reported about a portion of Collector Office Road dug up for placing a banner for R K Nagar MLA T T V Dhinakaran, a similar incident has taken place in VOC Road this time. When queried, the labourers involved in erecting the wooden frame said that banners were being placed to welcome VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan who is expected to participate in a meeting near VOC Road.
 
 “Craters and holes in new roads will make the surface more porous and water can seep into the road’s base at ease. Such damage would certainly affect the longevity of new roads besides endangering the commuters on roads,” M S Gowtham Shana, a road safety expert said. Banners being put up on VOC Road behind the Coimbatore bay of Central bus stand has almost occupied 5-6 feet of motorable space of the two-month-old VOC Road for which even road markings were not given.
 
 District collector K Rajamani after being intimated about the incident said that action would be taken against the offenders for damaging public property.
