Chandigarh: The Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday released the much-awaited Rs 18,124.85 crore cash credit limit (CCL) to the Punjab government for purchase of wheat in the ongoing rabi season.

 However, the state government had sought the total CCL of Rs 21,179.60 crore for the purchase of 130 lakh tonnes of wheat in this season. The state government had been persistently pursuing the matter with the central government and the RBI for the past several days.
 
 The current wheat procurement season started on April 1 and will culminate on May 31. The release of the CCL would help the state government make timely payments to the farmers against the purchases made from them. The minimum support price (MSP) of wheat has been fixed by the central government at Rs 1,735 per quintal, hiking it by Rs 110 from last year’s Rs 1,625 per quintal.
 
 The government spokesperson said the chief minister’s personal intervention in the 2017 Rabi season had led to the RBI enhancing the CCL for the state to Rs 20,683 crore from the previously sanctioned amount of Rs 17,994.21 crore.
 
 The chief minister has ordered the DGP to ensure strict enforcement of the ban on transport cartels and had also issued directives to the food and civil supplies department to ensure that the farmers do not face any hassles in the wheat procurement process.
