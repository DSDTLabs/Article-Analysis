NAVI MUMBAI:   by the   (QCI) to ascertain the cleanliness quotient of Navi Mumbai will be held from January 23 to 25. 

 The civic administration is ensuring that the public is aware of the means to win the competition. The public feedback is a must and they can do so on toll free number 1969 or by downloading the Swachhata MoUD app before January 20.
 
 “The more the number of app downloads and calls on toll-free number, the better the image of the city as it indirectly means that it’s not just the corporation even the residents are active participants,” said a civic official. —Sameera Kapoor Munshi
