BENGALURU: The Karnataka BJP went into the Nanjangud and Gundlupet bypoll fray, saying that the elections would show the people's mood in the state.

 The results not only belied their expectations but also failed to take advantage of the “Modi wave“ in the aftermath of the UP polls. Experts attributed the party's failure to deviate from Narendra Modi's renewed slogan of 'Sabka saath, sabka vikas'. Though the party put up a relentless struggle to upstage the ruling  , it took comfort from the hope that state party president B S  's upper-caste Lingayat community and V  , a noted dalit in the region, would together ensure smooth sailing as approximately half the electorate in both the constituencies is from the two communities.
 
 The BJP failed to learn from the party's outstanding show in the recent assembly elections in  , where the party emphasized vikas more than caste.
 
 In Karnataka, Yeddyurappa and other BJP leaders added fuel to fire by indulging in personal attacks on both the CM and Geetha, wife of former minister Mahadev Prasad, which eventually turned into an advantage for the Congress. The BJP should reassess its strategies and focus on development, which brought laurels in UP, and avoid vituperative attacks.
