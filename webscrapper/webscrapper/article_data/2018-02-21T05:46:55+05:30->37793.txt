NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday directed the police to investigate and file a status report of its probe into a cheating complaint against   promoter  . Choksi, through his counsel, argued that he could not be held "vicariously liable" as he is just the chairman of the group company and not the signatory.

 
 Justice Mukta Gupta said, "IO (investigating officer) would investigate and file a status report." The court was also informed that the investigation had come to a standstill following efforts of the complainant and the accused in the case trying to reach a settlement. Interim protection from any coercive action granted to Choksi in April last year will continue, the HC added and posted the next date of hearing on May 3.
 
 Appearing for Choksi, advocate Sandeep Kapur submitted that the grievance of cheating was not made out against his client. The counsel appearing for the police, on the other hand, informed the court that they would further investigate the matter.
 
 The FIR was lodged on the orders of a magisterial court on a complaint by BTech graduate Vaibhav Khurania alleging that his company RM Green Solutions had purchased a retail franchise of Gitanjali Jewellers from Choksi on an assurance of high returns.
 
 However, their dreams turned sour when they realised that "third-grade" damaged and old diamonds and gems were sent to them against a security deposit of Rs 1.5 crore.
