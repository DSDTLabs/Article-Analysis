Surat: If you think you are drinking Neera, the nectar derived from palm tree, then you are mistaken. The winter juice brought from villages of Olpaad and Choriyasi talukas of Surat district and sold by Gram Udhyog Sangh’s Neera Bhavan has artificial sweetener added to it. 

 RTI activist Rajesh Modi started a campaign against the quality of Neera served to thousands of people in the city and had urged Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) to carry out a test. TOI had highlighted the issue in its report dated February 3 subsequent to which the civic body collected samples from Neera Bhavan on station road and sent them for testing at a laboratory. The report has revealed presence of artificial sweetener.
 
 SMC’s medical officer Dr Ashish Naik told TOI, “The testing at a laboratory has found presence of artificial sweetener in the juice. It could be sugar or some other substance mixed with the juice to enhance sweetness.”
 
 Dr Naik added, “This is a clear case of misbranding of Neera juice. We are going to lodge a case against Neera Bhavan for misbranding and using sweetener to enhance the taste, thereby harming public health. The civic body will create an awareness among the public to not drink adulterated Neera juice.” 
 
 RTI activist Rajesh Modi said, “Neera juice is a popular drink in winters. Thousands of people consume the juice on a daily basis. Now that the test report has found artificial sweetener in it, the juice could be harmful to those suffering from diabetes. My purpose was to spread awareness about the same.”
