Vadodara: Passengers waiting in the security hold area before boarding their aircraft will now be able to enjoy their meals during the waiting period. 

 On Wednesday, a restaurant facility was started at the new integrated terminal building of Vadodara airport. 
 
 Although Prime Minister Narendra Modi had inaugurated the new terminal building touted to be second green airport in the country in October 2016, such a facility was missing at the new terminal building constructed at the cost of Rs 160 crore. The old Harni airport did have a full-fledged restaurant. 
 
 According to officials of Airports Authority of India (AAI), Club One which operates similar facilities at Jaipur International Airport and Udaipur airport among others will operate the restaurant at Vadodara airport. 
 
 “This will not only help AAI earn revenue but passengers will also be able to grab a meal, especially when they have skipped their breakfast or lunch to catch their flights. This facility will remain open during operational hours – starting from 6 am till 10 pm in the night,” said Vadodara airport director Charan Singh, who inaugurated the facility along with other dignitaries. 
 
 So far, the only option available with the passengers was fast food and some snacks. A couple of days back, the airport officials had put up a shop selling branded snacks in the security holding area. 
 
 Presently, a total of 20 flights, most of them to Delhi and Mumbai, operate from the Vadodara airport. According to AAI officials, the airport witnesses an average footfall of 3,200 passengers on a daily basis.
