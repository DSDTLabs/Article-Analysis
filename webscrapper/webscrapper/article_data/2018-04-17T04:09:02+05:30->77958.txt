MUMBAI: A youth was nabbed for allegedly molesting a 24-year-old woman at   during evening peak hour on Monday. The woman and her 21-year-old friend were about to board a train around 7 pm when two youths, who were part of a group of four, molested her, said the police. 

 As the four youths slipped away from the crowded platform, the two women grabbed one of them while the other three melted away into the crowd and disappeared.
 
 "We were about to board a train when I heard my friend shouting. I turned around to see the four youths. One of them touched my friend twice," the 21-year-old girl told TOI. 
 
 Other commuters at the spot, unaware of what had happened, stood by on hearing the din, she said. Many of them were still trying to figure out what had happened. "Nobody came forward to help, but only made enquiries," she said.
 
 The nabbed youth was quizzed about the identity of the others. "He claimed he does not know them and had met them a bit earlier," said the 21-year-old.
 
 The nabbed youth has been booked but not arrested yet.
