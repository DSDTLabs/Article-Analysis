KOLKATA: Love fish but want to avoid the stench and filth of local markets? The state government has come up with a solution.

Buoyed by huge response at the World Food India-17 at New Delhi, the   wants to widen its marketing network by linking with online marts and food and grocery delivery segment. 
 
 “Mobile apps have been popular in the transportation sector but this is the first time a government organisation has taken the initiative to launch a food app to sell items that will be delivered directly to the consumer’s home,” he said. The corporation has run a successful trial run of the app and has sold fish in  , Lake Town, Kestopur, Baguiati, Kankurgachhi.
 
 The corporation has chosen 22 varieties of fish, seven varieties of dried fish and fish pickle, among others, to be sold through this app. For the time being, the fish will be available across Kolkata and Howrah. It will be sold in packets of 250gm, 500gm and 1kg. By the end of this year, the items will be sold throughout the state, country and even abroad.“We are coming up with outlets in Bengaluru, Delhi, Jamshedpur, Ranchi, Jodhpur and Chandigarh, where a strong diaspora of Bengali population exist. We have also tied up with a private retail outlet for selling our products in Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune and Bengaluru,” Das added.
