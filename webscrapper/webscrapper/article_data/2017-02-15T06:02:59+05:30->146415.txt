BAREILLY: The   said on Tuesday that it favoured a uniform policy for the entire country to deal with the  , and their release from hospitals after they are cured.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice of India J S Khehar issued notice to the Union health ministry, saying that since the treatment of the mentally challenged figured in the concurrent list of the Constitution, the Centre also had the authority to frame requisite norms.
 
 A petition seeking the rehabilitation of people who had been cured of mental illness was filed in the apex court last year after a TOI report highlighted the plight of nearly 60 patients at the Bareilly mental hospital who had recovered but didn't have anywhere to go. Authorities at the hospital had said that they could not locate the addresses of the patients and thus didn't know where to send them. Many of the patients had been at the hospital, along with those still under treatment, for years.
 
 Petitioner Gaurav Kumar Bansal told TOI, "After hearing the PIL... the SC issued notice to the   and directed it to assist the court on the issue of the rehabilitation of thousands of people persons languishing in mental hospitals across the country. The SC also issued notices to all states in the matter."
 
 "The court observed that the issue was a serious one, and that cured persons should not be allowed to live in mental hospitals. After I read the TOI report in April last year on the miserable condition of inmates who had recovered but were forced to stay at the Bareilly mental hospital, I visited the institution. I also filed an   plea, and got to know that a total of 826 such people were housed in the 12 mental hospitals of the country."
 
 According to the RTI reply, there are as many as 380 patients at   in Ranchi. "It's totally unethical, and a violation of fundamental rights," Bansal said.
