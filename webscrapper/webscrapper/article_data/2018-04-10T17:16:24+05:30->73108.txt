She is seen seeking a rescue, in case someone gets to her plea. 
 
 The background score is equally eerie, and makes you want to know more about what will happen to Lilli. The viewerâ€™s heart goes out to Lilli, and leaves one to ponder over whether the pregnant woman will manage to get herself to the outside world.
