AGRA: In one of the biggest thefts in recent times, burglers made away with Rs 50 lakh worth valuables from the house of a businessman in Agra city’s posh   colony under the jurisdiction of   police. The burglary took place on Wednesday night when the owner of the house was away on a pilgrimage to Goverdhan in Mathura along with his family.
 
  Owner of a cold storage, Dinesh Mittal, 50, said, “The thieves took away five kg of silver, some gold jewellery along Rs 7 lakh cash and other items.” He said the CCTV camera installed in the house showed two men but Mittal did not rule out the involvement of more people in the theft.
  
  He said, “According to CCTV feed, the theft was executed between 7:04 pm to 9 pm on Wednesday night. We reached home at around 9:55 pm. We saw all our cupboard lockers were open and valuables missing. We immediately informed police.”
  
  Shahganj police personnel along with a dog squad searched the nearby area but the dogs could not pick up the scent of the thieves.
  
  Station house officer of Shahganj Rajeshwar Tyagi said, “Barring CCTV camera, there was no guard in the colony to keep a tab on movement of people. We went through the footage but still haven’t got a good lead. The thieves have managed to avoid the camera. We are probing the matter and soon will be arresting some people.”
  
  It is interesting to note that the residences of BJP MP Chaudhary Babulal and MLA Chaudhary Uday Bhan are in Alok Nagar, which is close to Alok Nagar. The BJP district headquarters is also located nearby.
  
  On Thursday afternoon, BJP MLA Jagan Prasad Garg, BJP district president Shyam Bhadoria, trader association president Murali Lal and several other political leaders visited Mittal’s house to express their concern. They requested police to arrest the accused as soon as possible.
