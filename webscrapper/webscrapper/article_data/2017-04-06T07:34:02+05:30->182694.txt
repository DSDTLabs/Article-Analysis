BHOPAL: Staff at   is having a tough time these days to ensure that the   keep functioning, as platform urchins often press   for fun, which brings escalators to a  .

 “In a day, we have to get the keys from the station manager’s office more than five to six times to restart the escalators,” said the operator on duty. Station manager Pradeep Singh said, “This is a long-standing problem for us. Though there is an operator and   personnel on duty, yet they are able to find ways to press the button. We have been trying to remove these urchins from the stairs, but they return again and again.” 
 
 As the operator is not present at times, it remains defunct for around one to three hours until any passenger reports to deputy station superintendent on duty. Sometimes they press the button and run away. During the day hours when there isn’t much rush they converge near escalators until they are shooed away by RPF or station officials.
 
 Some passengers too have reported that they have seen these urchins giggling over after stopping the escalators for fun. Anupama Keshav, a passenger from Dakshin express, said, “Escalators are of no use to the passengers at Bhopal railway station, as they remain defunct all the time. Even after having this automatic facility to reach foot over bridge, we had to climb the stairs with heavy luggage. I have seen these children pressing the button unnecessarily,” she added. “Escalators and lifts are of great help for senior citizens like us at the railway stations, but we always suffer here,” said Param Das, a senior citizen at Bhopal railway station. Scores of passengers are forced to take stairs despite having the facility in this scenario, he added.
 
 The station manager said, “We can only ask these children to move away from the escalators and we try our best to do that.”
