NEW DELHI: The   ( ), headed by senior most   judge Justice  , has decided to make   a bimonthly affair to settle cases pending in all courts and chip away at the monstrous pendency of nearly three crore cases.

 Justice Misra said the burden of courts had to be reduced by developing a culture of settlement. 
 
 He added that all state legal services authorities had been provided with a set of guidelines to help persuade parties to settle their disputes. “The award of a Lok Adalat is final and cannot be challenged by way of appeal and revision. 
 
 Moreover, if a dispute is settled in the Lok Adalat, court fee paid by a party would be refunded to him,” Justice Misra said while detailing the incentives attached to settling a dispute through Lok Adalats.
 
 The second national Lok Adalat of this year, held on April 8 and conducted from taluk level courts up to high courts, saw 6.60 lakh cases getting settled. This included erasing 3.68 lakh cases from courts and 2.92 lakh cases which were in the pre-litigation stage.
 
 One of the first national Lok Adalats was held on November 23, 2013, which saw a massive 35 lakh cases getting settled in the Supreme Court, HCs, district courts and taluk level courts.
