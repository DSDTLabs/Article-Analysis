 Inspector J N Chavda, constable Sanjay Gadhvi and Chuntaji Thakor of Shertha, a guard at the toll plaza, were injured when the gang leader had first tried to run them over at the toll plaza. One of the gang then opened fire on the police vehicles, while the SUV reversed away to flee.
 
 “One of the accused, Naresh Ramlal, was hit by a police bullet in the hand when police returned fire. Naresh was taken to a hospital in Mehsana and later shifted to VS Hospital in Ahmedabad. Chavda, who continued the chase with both his knees badly injured, is now being treated at VS Hospital. Thakor, who suffered head injuries, is now out of danger,” said deputy commissioner of police Deepan Bhadran.
 
 Bhadran said police recovered a .315 calibre country-made weapon with an expended cartridge in the chamber and one live cartridge from the SUV. “We have handed over the accused to the Adalaj police for further investigation,” Bhadran added.
 
 Additional deputy superintendent of police Rajdeepsinh Zala said the gang has stolen 50 MUVs from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan and would sell them to bootleggers and transport racketeers for Rs 8,000 per vehicle.
 
 “The bootleggers and transport racketeers used these vehicles to smuggle liquor or to transport people between villages in Rajasthan. “If they were caught, they would abandon the vehicle and flee,” added Zala.
