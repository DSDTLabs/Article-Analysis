CHANDIGARH: Hafed chairman   said the state government had started procurement of mustard seeds and farmers should not panic due to the roster system as it aims at avoiding glut in the purchase centres. Kalyan was replying to media questions regarding fear of farmers due to the roster system, in Chandigarh on Friday. 

 He said the deputy commissioners would prepare the roster in such a way that a separate day or time was kept for the left-out farmers, who, due to any reason, were not able to bring their produce on the designated day. Farmers would be informed about the days in advance through “munadi” (beating of drums) in villages and newspapers, he added.
 
 Kalyan said with a view to avoid distress sale of mustard seeds by the state farmers and protect their economic interest, the   government had started the procurement of mustard seeds conforming to the fair average quality (FAQ) specifications at the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 4,000 per quintal, including bonus of Rs 100 per quintal, from March 15.
