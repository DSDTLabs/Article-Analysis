BENGALURU: The high court on Friday ordered issuance of a bailable warrant against liquor baron   in a contempt petition filed by a consortium of banks that had lent money to his now-defunct  .

 A division bench of Justices   and   issued the warrant for Rs 1 lakh, returnable by February 17. This was after the court noted that Mallya failed to appear despite its December 2, 2016 order.
 
 Mallya's counsel informed the bench that the court order has been communicated to Mallya and there has been no response from his side. Counsel said Mallya is not in the country and that has already been recognized by the  , so no purpose would be served by issuing a bailable warrant. He sought for issuance of a non-bailable warrant through the ministry of home affairs (MHA).
 
 The bench said it will first issue a bailable warrant. It noted that there is no material before the court to say Mallya has left the country.
