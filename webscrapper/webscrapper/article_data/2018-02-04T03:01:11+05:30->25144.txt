GUWAHATI:   ended its 15-year alliance between the Naga People’s Front ( ) in Nagaland on Saturday, breaking away from the senior ally in the ruling   (DAN) and entered into a new partnership with the National Democratic   ( ).

 JD (U), the third partner in the alliance, has also pulled out of the DAN. This marks the total collapse of the partnership forged in 2003 under the initiative of  , the current leader of BJP’s new partner NDPP, and the then-NDA chairman George Fernandes.
 
 Announcing the new political arrangement with Rio by his side, Union minister of state for home and BJP’s observer for Nagaland Kiren Rijiju said, “Earlier, BJP was not a major force. 
 
 Now, we need a seat-sharing agreement. Hence this departure from past practice.” BJP will once again be the junior partner in this electoral understanding as well, with NDPP contesting 40 of the 60 seats, leaving the remaining 20 for BJP.
 
 Rio, who himself left NPF to join NDPP after months of speculation that he was the brainchild behind the new party’s formation, said, “We will form the next government. We appeal to the people to join us and take part in the election.” NDPP was one the 11 signatories to the joint declaration to boycott polls until a “resolution” to the Naga peace process, a decision which fell through later. NPF said it is “relieved”. “It seems like a big load has been taken off our shoulders. We talk our minds freely,” party spokesperson Sebastian Zumvu said.
 
 Cracks between NPF and BJP first appeared in July. Following intra-party dissension within NPF in July last year, the Shurhozelie-led faction had severed ties with the saffron party, believing it was behind the disruption.
