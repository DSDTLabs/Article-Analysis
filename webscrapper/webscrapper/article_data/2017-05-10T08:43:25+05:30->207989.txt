HYDERABAD: The   too is gung ho about the   and is mulling a  . "Logistics has been identified as one of the  . In the first few years, we focused on IT,  ,  , defence and aerospace. Now that these sectors are doing well, we are focusing on the next set of sectors, which includes textiles, food processing, automotive as well as logistics. We will be preparing a policy for the sector. As of now, the regular incentives that we provide under the industrial policy are available for the sector but we would like to customize certain benefits for logistics players...," Telangana industries department principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan said. 

 Ranjan added that after the government announced the setting up of dry ports in the state, it has been approached by leading international as well as domestic players that are keen on investing. On May 5 this year, the state government also inked an MoU with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to set up a logistics park in the state.
 
 While the sector offers huge potential, Jasmine Singh of CBRE South Asia Pvt Ltd said that in the near-term, Hyderabad's logistics market will not reach the scale of the sector in Mumbai or Delhi-NCR region.
 
 "Hyderabad is not a distribution centre or a regional node, it is driven by local consumption. Mumbai, with one of the busiest ports in the country, has a lot of import containers coming in and export containers going out. Delhi NCR is a hub for redistribution of goods coming from down south...a part of which gets consumed in the region and rest is redistributed in the north and western parts of country," Singh said.
