Panchkula: Robochamps, a Mohali-based robotics company that trains students, on Tuesday claimed to have broken the Guinness Book of World Record by organising world’s biggest live robotics class at Indradhanush auditorium, Sector 5. Over 1,200 students from schools of north India participated in this classroom.

 The event was held in partnership with The Times of India.
 
 The previous record for biggest robotics class was held by Secretaria de Educación of Bogotá, Colombia. In this event over 800 students had taken part on October 1, 2015.
 
 In Panchkula, 1,200 students from Class III to XII made live robots.
 
 Haryana’s Google boy Kautilya Pandit encouraged and interacted with the students. Each participant was awarded with a certificate.
 
 Officials of Guinness Book of World Records prepared the necessary documentation at the event, but the final certification of the new world record would be given within a week after examining the facts of the event, said one of the organisers.
 
 Students were also given practical training at the event, as they were taught around 20 topics of science and mathematics. The training session was practical-oriented, a huge addition to the student’s skill. The session not only allowed students to participate in the record attempt but also increased their understanding of robotics concepts.
 
 Akshay Ahuja, founder, Robochamps said, “This teaching methodology is implemented through training in robotics, which allows students to effectively understand scientific and technological concepts.”
 
 Madhu Chitkara, vice-chancellor, Chitkara University, Rajpura (Punjab), was the chief guest, while Parmod Kumar, state programme officer, department of school education, Haryana, and N K Verma, assistant director, academics, were special guests.
