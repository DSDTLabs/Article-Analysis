Mohali: The police were yet to make any arrests in the case of groping of two women at a nightclub and assault on three men outside 15 days after the incident took place.

 Zirakpur police station house officer Bhagwant Singh said, “We have deployed our teams at their hideouts. We are also keeping tab on the way of communication. We have also approached other nightclubs from where bouncers had allegedly come to attack the victims.”
 
 The two accused have been identified as Rohit Rathi and Varun.
 
 The incident took place at Junkyard Lounge in Zirakpur, where three men along with two women, including a brother and sister, had gone to attend a birthday party. One out of the two accused had started to touch the women inappropriately. When the women objected, he apologised but later repeated the act with the second accused. The bouncer threw them out of the discotheque after the women lodged a complaint. When the group of five came out, the two accused along with 20-odd men attacked them with sharp-edged weapons. The brother of one of the women was hit by an iron rod on his head. He received 25 stitches. Another youth received 19 stitches.
