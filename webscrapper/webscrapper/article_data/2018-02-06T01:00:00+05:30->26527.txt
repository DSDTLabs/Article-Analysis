We began our careers together and were only 21 when we were paired with each other on Kumkum... In the beginning, we did not even get along with each other.

That’s when I realised how immature I was and found a great friend in her. Mrunal is busy with her career right now and so am I. We are great buddies and only wish well for each other.
