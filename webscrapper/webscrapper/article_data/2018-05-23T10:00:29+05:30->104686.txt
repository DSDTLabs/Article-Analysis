 Researchers at   asked a professional violinist to play 15 antique instruments, including one from 1570 by  , who is considered to be the father of the modern four-string violin. Others played in the study were from the Stradivarius family, conceived by  , who improved Amati’s design.
 
 Performing a thorough acoustic analysis, they found that an Amati violin and a   da Salo violin mimicked the basses and baritones of male singers.
 
 “In contrast, Stradivari violins were marked by elevated formants, making them relatively more similar to female voices,” such as tenors and altos, the researchers added.
