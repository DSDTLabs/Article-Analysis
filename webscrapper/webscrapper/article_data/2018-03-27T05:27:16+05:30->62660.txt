KOLKATA: Nearly 8.26 lakh examinees are likely to appear for their   on Tuesday across the state even as political violence kept people on the edge in some pockets.

 The state Higher Secondary Council has been in touch with the district magistrates and police superintendents, trying to gauge the situation, particularly in   and North 24-Parganas. “We have been assured that the administration will give adequate security in the examination centres. However, our concerns aren’t just that. The students need to reach to these centres. Disruption of this nature, therefore, remains a cause of concern. If we receive any such report appropriate action will be taken,” said a senior board official, refusing to be named.
  
 Laxmi Narayan Meena, commissioner of   police commissionerate, said: “We have made adequate arrangements. If need be we will also transport students to their respective examination centres.” A senior police officer said, “In addition to regular deployments, additional forces are being called in. We apprehend no further problem. Peace meetings have been convened and all stakeholders informed, among others, the necessity to maintain calm during the examination season.”
 
 The council on its own will appoint a special observer or a council nominee at every examination venue. Two special observers have been appointed in each of the 150 sensitive venues with   They will be present at the venues from 8am onwards. In addition, there will be venue supervisors.
 
 “We have decided to do videography and take other enhanced security measures in every exam centre,” said a senior council office bearer.
