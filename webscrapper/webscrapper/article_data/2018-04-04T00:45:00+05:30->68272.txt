Ahmedabad: Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (EDII) has inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Government of Malaysia’s Human Resource Development (HRD) Fund on Monday. As part of the MoU, EDII will be providing training on entrepreneurship to some 100 entrepreneurs from Malaysia. At present, some 20 mentors from Malaysia in different sectors are already taking training for mentorship at EDII. Sharing more details, Sunil Shukla, director, EDII, said, “The MoU was signed in presence of the prime ministers of India and Malaysia in Hyderabad. The training will be conducted in batches of 25 participants each over a period of three weeks, wherein entrepreneurship lessons, tools and techniques to help form a viable business plan will be incorporated specific to the various sectors.” Business sectors such as tourism, food processing, renewable energy, information technology and healthcare are some of the key areas where Malaysian entrepreneurs are looking at business opportunities. The entire training is being funded by Malaysian government. Previously, EDII has conducted training in entrepreneurship for Malaysian government’s Pembangunan Sumber Manusia Berhad (PSMB), another arm of HRD Fund. That apart, the institute has also conducted trainings for entrepreneurs in countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos across South East Asia. Talking about the importance of such a training, S M Siva, director, IMS – Asia, a partner agency of EDII based in Malaysia, said, “Around 90% of businesses in Malaysia are Small and Medium Entreprises (SMEs). With the global phenomenon, industry needs to rapidly adopt changes in ways of doing business and embrace technology. At a time, when entrepreneurship is becoming a preferred choice among youngsters, a training in entrepreneurship is a must. We’ve been working with EDII for a long while and the business ecosystem and cultural framework along with development mindset is similar between the two countries.”
