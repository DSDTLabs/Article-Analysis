BHOPAL: Congress may not be willing to open its cards on its so-called 'soft Hindutva', but the   feels certain   chief   will repeat his Gujarat-style temple tours in Madhya Pradesh and   ahead of assembly elections in both states. 

  BJP leaders in MP claim AICC has sought details of temples in MP and CG that Rahul Gandhi can visit. "We have learnt that Congress is preparing a list of temples to be visited by Rahul Gandhi during assembly election this year. But, visiting temples alone won't suffice. The Congress has to demonstrate its so-called 'Hindutva approach' in policies by stopping politics of appeasement. The party has been exposed for cheating the public and failed to fetch votes in Gujarat," said BJP state spokesperson Deepak Vijayavargiya. 
 
  Sources in Congress pointed out that though Rahul's temple visits in Gujarat were derided by BJP, his 10-week campaign during which he visited 27 temples proved to be effective. Congress won as many as 18 seats in these areas - 10 of which it wrested from BJP.
