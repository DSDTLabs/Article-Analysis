Unlike most of her co-actors in ' ',   chose not to watch 'Rajkahini', the Bengali movie the film is adapted from. The actress plays Gulabo, a prostitute in the brothel located on the newly-defined line of control between India and Pakistan in the year 1947. About her prep, she told BT, “Women are sexualised often and from a young age. I’ve worked with kids who have been victims of sexual abuse and even those who have been rehabilitated in Kamathipura. But it was very important for me to not use that as research and treat   as a woman whose profession is prostitution. She doesn’t judge herself for being a prostitute because that’s where life’s circumstances have taken her.”

 Pallavi believes that prostitution, as a word, is often used flippantly. “The idea of selling oneself doesn’t come from just selling your body. I used many methods to get into my character, but it was also about going deep within me as a woman because you know how you feel when you are sexualised. Women have to struggle with the male gaze from the time they’re young. Gulabo had a thorough backstory. That, and the workshops helped me prepare for my role.”
