 Lalwani said that once the ducts are prepared, the lines will be transferred to the them. He added that they will not face problems transferring cables.

 A similar project to create ducts is also underway in   area.
 
 Officials of the development body said that they would also decide on appointing a consultant for large scale plantations and construction of gardens at Super Corridor.
