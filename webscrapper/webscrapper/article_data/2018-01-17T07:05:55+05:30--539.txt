CHENNAI: Billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s RARE Enterprises has made a surprise bid for   & Allied Insurance, the first stand-alone health   company in the country, which is carrying a price tag of $1 billion. Jhunjhunwala’s RARE will slug it out with Azim Premji’s Premji Invest and nearly half a dozen financial investors.

 It is learnt that bids have been received from financial investors Kedaara Capital, WestBridge, Temasek and Prudential and strategic investors including ICICI Lombard and HDFC General Insurance, as the transaction enters the last leg.
 
 All the investors in Star Health — ICICI Venture, Sequoia Capital, Tata Capital, Alpha TC Holdings, Apis Partners, Oman Insurance Company and ETA Star of Dubai — appear to be in favour of a sale.
 
 The management headed by V Jagannathan, former CMD of United India, has driven the company to be one of the profitable insurers in the health space. Besides, with a slew of insurance companies getting into the public float mode, shareholders feel the timing is perfect for a sale.
 
 There are two possibilities. First, bring in a financial investor who will provide an exit for all other shareholders in the company and get the company moving along with Jagannathan and management team at the helm. The second is a sale to a strategic investor. “The second option is unlikely as the management feels that the financial investor will help retain the Star Health brand,” sources said.
 
 Repeated attempts to reach Star Health’s Jagannathan did not succeed.
 
 It is learnt that I-banker Kotak, who is running the deal process, could consummate it over the next couple of months.
