KOLKATA: West Bengal may be one of the three non-BJP ruled states to see a drop in the total budget allocation in this year’s railway budget.

 While there was no official confirmation as the Pink Book is yet to be released, a source said the state has received Rs 899 crore less this year compared to 2017-18.
 
 
  
 
 The other two states to see a fall in allocations are Kerala and Delhi reportedly. Rajasthan, which goes to the polls later this year, has been allotted nearly 30% more as compared to last year.
 
 “Uttarakhand, which was swept by the   (57 of 70 seats) seems to have been rewarded this year. It is likely to be the biggest gainer though most parts are at too hilly to be connected by rail. The state’s outlay is likely to go up from Rs 566 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 1,490 crore this year. This is a 163% hike. Rajasthan’s outlay may also go up from Rs 3,495 crore to Rs 4,553 crore.  , where BJP just managed to scrape through in the 2017 Assembly polls, will also witness a growth of nearly 20%. In 2017-18, the state had received 3,994 crore and may go up to Rs 4,809 this year,” said the source.
 
 Though an official said nothing can be told for certain till specific allocations are declared, the state’s total outlay for 2018-19 is likely to be around Rs 5,437 crore, a 14% drop from 2017-18. While Delhi’s allocation may fall by 40%, Kerala’s dip is likely to be nearly 23%.
 
 The Pink Book was supposed to be released on Monday but the demand for grants could not be tabled in the Parliament as it was adjourned due to the demise of a member. The figures have been compiled from documents to highlight how most states have gained after the NDA came to power in 2014.
 
 “This is more of a political document in which the average annual outlay during the UPA’s years in power and that in the last four-odd years are calculated and compared. This year, 19 of 22 states are likely to be shown to have had enjoyed a growth of more than 100%. States like Chhattisgarh,   and Gujarat have also registered growths of over 400%. Both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh go to the polls later this year. Interestingly, West Bengal’s growth has been shown as 1%. After all, the BJP hasn’t got anything to lose in West Bengal. Rather, the BJP can always say how West Bengal’s outlay dipped due to delays in land acquisition and eviction of encroachers,” the source added.
 
 In 2017-18, West Bengal’s share was a whopping Rs 6,336 crore, second to Uttar Pradesh’s Rs 7,118 crore. This year, despite the ongoing Metro projects proceeding in full swing, the state is likely to be fifth in the list behind Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Assam and the northeastern state. The source claimed that West Bengal’s share will be Rs 5,437 this year, a drop of 14% from the previous year.
 
 A sizeable portion of the state’s outlay will go towards Metro projects, mainly the E-W Metro, phases of which will start getting commissioned from June this year. This means that allocations for other projects have been squeezed. The state has problems of land acquisition and also evicting encroachers from railway land.
