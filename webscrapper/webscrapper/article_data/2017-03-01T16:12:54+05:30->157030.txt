THRISSUR: Director   on Wednesday said the recent abduction and sexual assault on the Malayalam actor should not lead to blind generalisations that the entire film field is under the grip of criminal and drug mafia gangs.

 Talking on the sidelines of a function here Sathyan said probes must be carried out to find out whether there are any conspiracies behind the incident. But the activities of a driver who had come as a substitute for the regular employee should not lead to blanket accusations, he said.
 
 "  is now passing through a phase of resurgence. After 1980s lot of brilliant directors, script writers and actors are emerging in Malayalam film field now. , and we should not dampen their enthusiasm by propagating that they are in a field which is under clutches of mafias and goons," he said.
  
 Sathyan hailed the decision of the actress to come back to acting within days of such a horrifying torture as an "extraordinarily bold step’’. The entire society must support her in this inspiring step, he said.
 
 He also welcomed the decision of the actor Prithviraj not to act in films which debase women. “I understand that other senior actors like Mohanlal and Mammootty have also taken such decisions internally, though they have not spoken about publicly. Several other directors and script writers also share the view. However it must be remembered that film is not a homily, and there could be some contexts in films where some aggressive statements would be inevitable’’ Sathyan said.
  
 Replying to questions, he however, conceded that even in such contexts it should be possible to mitigate the consequences of such observations through counter statements.
