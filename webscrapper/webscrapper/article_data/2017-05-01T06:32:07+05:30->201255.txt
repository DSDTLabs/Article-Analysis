NEW DELHI: With vacancies piling up in the party’s central organisation, a major reshuffle is expected soon of central BJP office-bearers and also in some state units like Uttar Pradesh. 

 Vacancies in the central organisation were created after BJP’s recent assembly victories in UP and elsewhere. The assembly wins have also created vacancies in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Cabinet and there is speculation on whether the reshuffle in the party and the government will be done around the same time. 
 
 Forming the government in UP alone has created several vacancies in the central unit. Yogi Adityanath taking over as UP chief minister has necessitated two byelections — his parliamentary seat and one in UP to make him a member of the state assembly. Three national secretaries — Srikant Sharma, Siddharth Nath Singh and Mahendra Singh — won in UP and moved as ministers in the Yogi cabinet. National vice-president Dinesh Sharma has taken over as deputy chief minister and another vice-president, Trivendra Singh Rawat, has been made Uttarakhand CM and they will have to be replaced. 
 
 As vice-presidents, Rawat and Sharma were in-charge of Jharkhand and Gujarat respectively, which will now have to be handed over to other leaders. The other deputy CM in UP, Keshav Prasad Maurya, will have to quit as chief of the state BJP unit and make way for a new party president in UP. With half a dozen names floating around for the post, the state unit will hold its executive in Lucknow from May 2, which party chief Amit Shah is slated to attend. 
 
 While the timing of the reshuffle is unclear, party insiders are of the view that it could either take place within a couple of weeks or get linked to the changes the PM makes in his cabinet, which would mean it might have to wait till the presidential elections in July.
