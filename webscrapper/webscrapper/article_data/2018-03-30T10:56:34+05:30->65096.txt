HYDERABAD: Giving its nod for the initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process against   ( ), the Hyderabad bench of the   (NCLT) has appointed   as interim resolution professional ( ).

 The ruling came in response to a petition filed by ICICI Bank under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) after LTHPPL failed to repay its ?313 crore debt. LTHPPL was to set up a hydroelectric power project across the Teesta river in Sikkim for which it took loans from a consortium of lenders led by ICICI Bank but failed to execute the project.
 
 ICICI Bank argued that LTHPPL’s financial position did not improve even after restructuring and its account was classified as NPA (non-performing asset) on March 31, 2016. LTHPPL’s dues also mounted to Rs 313 crore as on November 30, 2017.
 
 Due to non-implementation of the project, the Sikkim government issued a notice on August 16, 2017, for termination of the agreement. LTHPPL was to supply 12% free power to Sikkim for the first 15 years and after that 15% from the hydropower project.
 
 However, LTHPPL argued before the NCLT bench that the project could not be completed as per schedule for reasons beyond its control such as delay in the diversion of forest land and poor geology. It said that though the company started the groundwork for the projects over five years ago there was a downward trend in hydroelectric projects in the country due to a rise in costs of such projects.
 
 Observing that LTHPPL had defaulted and could not find a solution to the issue, the NCLT bench said it thought it fit to admit ICICI Bank’s petition and initiate the corporate insolvency resolution process.
 
 The case has now been posted for April 18, 2018, for the IRP’s report.
