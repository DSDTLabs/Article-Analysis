Pakistani   Atif Aslam brought his   here to a halt to rescue a female fan, who was being   by some guys during the show. 

  
  
 The incident happened on Saturday when the 33-year-old 'Pehli  ' hit-maker had taken to the stage to belt out his hit numbers for the crowd. 
 
 However, midway during his performance, Atif motioned his hand and asked the musicians to stop playing when he noticed a group of men bothering a girl in the front row. He went up to them and sternly asked the boys not to harass the girl. "Haven't you seen a girl? Atif asked the gang angrily, "Your mother or sister could be here as well," he added. 
 
 After issuing a warning to the rowdy boys, the singer pulled up the girl on the stage and asked concert organisers to get her a place somewhere else. "Insaan ka baccha ban (act like a human being)," Atif reprimanded them, before resuming the show.
