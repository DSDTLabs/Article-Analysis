Jaipur: In an attempt to promote transparency and take forward the digital India campaign, Income Tax department in Rajasthan on Thursday launched its official website. The portal will act as one point stop for all the tax payers to get information on tax related issues. 

 Launching the website formally, principal chief commissioner of income tax, Ameeta Saini said, “Through this portal our department will now be able to interact with the tax payers better. Along with it public can post their grievance too,” said Saini. She added, “Role of website should not be just restricted to that. People should use it more and also give their feedback and suggestions.” 
 
 According to the officials, website will provide detailed information on organization structure and their functioning. “This will make it easy for the user to contact the concerned official instead of roaming around. Along with it there is a calendar available that will help tax payers in reminding the dates of tax payments” added the official. 
 
 There is also a section where both tax payers and tax collectors can interact with each other. However department officials claim that there will be more features added to the website based on the feedback provided.
