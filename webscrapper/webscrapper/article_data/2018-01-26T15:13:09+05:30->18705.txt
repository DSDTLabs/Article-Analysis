GURUGRAM: Here’s good news for city residents striving for strong regulations for the real estate sector. After missing multiple deadlines, an office for the   (H-Rera) will be finally set up in Gurugram from February 1, officials said.

 The temporary office will start functioning out of the public works department (PWD) guest house on Old Railway Road near the Gurugram police commissionerate. However, the permanent office will come up in Sector 44 six months later.
 
 “With 65% of the state’s reality projects located in Gurugram and the increasing number of builder-buyer disputes, it is essential that we start the Gurugram H-Rera office at the earliest. H-Rera (Gurugram) chairman KK Khandelwal is expected to inspect the office soon,” a senior H-Rera official told TOI on Thursday.
 
 Apart from an accounts wing, administrative wing and a legal wing, the Gurugram H-Rera office will have a complaint and registry wing. The H-Rera court will be headed by a sessions judge.
 
 A total of 52 officials will start working in the office initially and the numbers will be increased over time. While some of the officials will be on deputation, some will be retired government servants while others will be hired on outsourcing basis. 
 
 Officials said the complaints under   would be ideally resolved within 60 days. “A regulation finalising the timeline would be issued soon. Homebuyers can also file complaints online regarding buyer-builder disputes. We will also have a prosecution wing which will most likely be headed by a high-ranking police officer or an advocate general,” said the official.
 
 Two H-Rera members for the Gurugram office will be selected over this week.
