LUCKNOW:   chief   will celebrate her 62nd birthday on Monday sans any pomp and show. Having asked her cadres not to give her expensive gifts, the former UP chief minister, has decided to restrict the celebrations to a press conference which would be aired live and shown on big screens installed to party workers and supporters in one or more locations in various districts of UP. 

 Party sources said that Mayawati is likely to use the occasion to hit out at the BJP while giving a clarion call to her party workers to gear up for the 2019 Lok   elections. "Her address will be shown live on screens to party supporters," said a senior BSP functionary. Party sources said that the content of Mayawati's speech would also be posted on social media for her supporters.
 
 Mayawati would also release the 13th volume of her book "A Travalogue Of My Struggle Ridden Life and  " on the occasion. 
 
 BSP cadres, who celebrate their party supremo's birthday as 'Jan Kalyankari Diwas' (public welfare day), would distribute blankets and fruits to the poor and downtrodden. "An appeal has been issued to party workers to donate for the poor," said a BSP district president. 
 
 Sources said that party functionaries are also preparing to cut cakes at party offices to mark the occasion. 
 
 This would be fourth year in a row since her party's humiliating decimation in 2014   elections that Mayawati would be keeping her birthday celebrations a low key affair. 
 
 Mayawati had held a massive rally on her 58th birthday to kick off the election campaign for 2014 Lok Sabha elections. She did not organise a rally or hold any celebrations on her birthday last year due to model code of conduct for assembly elections.
 
  Facing allegations of selling party tickets during elections, which her party lost consistently, party sources said that Mayawati wants an image makeover for herself and has hence been keeping her birthday celebrations subdued.
