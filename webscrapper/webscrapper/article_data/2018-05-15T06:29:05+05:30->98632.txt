BENGALURU: Scoring 99.1% in the   (class 12), Era Gupta and Sanyukta Giri of Bishop   have clinched the all-India third rank and topped Karnataka.

 Era, who scored centums in physics, chemistry and biotechnology, aspires to be a doctor and land a seat at AIIMS, New Delhi. “Most people who know of my ambition told me to focus on National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). But I didn’t want to sideline the boards and I’m glad my efforts have paid off,” she said.
 
 Era said most of her time was spent in school and at  , leaving her with only a couple of hours to study at home. “Swimming and dancing proved to be major stressbusters for me. My teachers were extremely supportive and never let me lose confidence,” she said. 
 
 Era, who even benefited from online content, said: “Social media is not a distraction. In fact, it helped me. My friends kept me calm whenever I was worked up,” she said.
 
 Sanyukta scored centums in physics and biotechnology. “I don’t follow a schedule and just go with the flow,” she told TOI. Like her peers, she began preparation after the model examination. She didn’t attend coaching classes as she felt classroom lessons were sufficient. Sanyukta, who’d rather interact with others in person than online, spends her leisure time reading, her favourite author being Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky.
 
 Her mother Anita Gopalan said, “She has always been interested in reading, and studied more than just her textbooks.” Sanyukta looks up to her brother Vikramaditya, a mathematician at University of Cambridge, for inspiration. She has appeared for NEET and plans to pursue medicine due to her love for biology. 
 
 Sanyukta said she was motivated by her parents’ pep talks. “They were very supportive and weren’t interested in marks as such,” she said.
