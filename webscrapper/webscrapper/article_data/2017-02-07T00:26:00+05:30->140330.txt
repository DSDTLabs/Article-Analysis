BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan says ‘give and take’ takes a person on path of ‘happiness’.

 Speaking on sixth day of the 29th Plenary Assembly of Conference of   (CCBI) at St Joseph’s Co-ed School, Arera Colony in the capital, Chouhaan said happiness does not come with being wealthy. Happiness comes by helping people in need.
 
 “We will run   by a method of give and take in the sense that those who have surplus will give and those in need will take,” CM said.
 
 When he put forth the idea of establishing happiness department, people made fun of him. “But that did not deter me from serving my people, I will continue to offer happiness one way or the other, even if people feel it is something funny,” he said.
 
 The chief minister expressed gratitude to officials for organising   of Catholic bishops in Bhopal.
 
 Reiterating his stand to offer happiness among school students, the CM reciting lyrics of Kishore Kumar’s Bollywood hit ‘Hum Hain Raahee Pyaar Ke Hum Se Kuchh Naa Boliye Jo Bhee Pyaar Se Milaa, Hum Usee Ke Ho Liye’.
 
 “I once again remind students that I will bear all academic fees for professional courses of those students, who would get 85% marks in Class 12,” he says.
 
 Meanwhile, the conference of CCBI was marked by a mesmerising cultural evening in which students of St Joseph’s School participated. Students performed kathak, dance drama and folk dance.
 
 The conference was attended by hundreds of locals besides, 132 dioceses and 182 bishops from all over India.
 
 The conference will conclude on February 8 at the Pastoral Centre, Ashaniketan Campus, Bhopal.
 
 The Archdiocese of Bhopal under the leadership of its Metropolitan Archbishop Dr Leo Cornelio S.V.D. hosted the assembly.
