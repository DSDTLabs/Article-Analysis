 A bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice N V Ramana told petitioner Vineet Sahai’s counsel Sarvesh Bisaria, “A state may decide to ban it while another may decide not to. We cannot interfere in such decisions.”
 
 Bisaria said many states had banned   but some still allowed it. “This has resulted in rampant illegal transportation of cattle from states which have banned cow slaughter to those states which permit slaughter. Moreover, there is no policy in place to

 The CJI told Bisaria that the SC had passed comprehensive directions to the Centre and states in July last year to frame rules to stop illegal inter-state and cross-border transportation of cattle. “Committees have been put in place by states to prevent illegal cattle transportation,” the bench said and dismissed the PIL.
 
 Only a few states -- Kerala, West Bengal, Nagaland, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim -- permit slaughter of cow and serving of beef in restaurants.
