YAVATMAL: The much-awaited   in Yavatmal has been given green signal by the   after a joint meeting of the concerned departments and the district administration at mantralaya chaired by the   and district guardian minister   on March 16.

 While talking to TOI on Sunday, Yerawar said that the setting up of the textile park was pending since long despite the proposal being initiated by the then CM Pritviraj Chavan.
 
 “I had summoned a meeting of the officers from MIDC, a senior scientist from NEERI, Nagpur and the district collector to know the hurdles that caused the lingering of the proposed park and I was told that the major issue was of the adequate land for the project,” Yerawar informed. He added that 93 hectares of land in Lohara-based MIDC has now been reserved for the park and the work would soon be launched.
 
 “Yavatmal is popularly known as the city of white gold (cotton) but it is deprived of any industry based on cotton across the district,” he said, adding that the park would ensure large scale employment opportunity to the educated youths of the region besides providing better avenues for the farmers to garner the maximum benefit.
 
 “We have proposed to set up basic infrastructure, including supply of energy, water and provision for sewage water treatment plant in the park site,” Yerawar said. He added that a 132 KV electricity sub station would also be set up in the park site to cater the energy requirements of the units that may come up over there.
