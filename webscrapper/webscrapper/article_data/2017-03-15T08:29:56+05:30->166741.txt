AHEMDABAD: On occasion of the   on Wednesday, representatives of   ( ) urged the   ( ) to urgently establish a regulatory body for e-commerce to help resolve disputes across the industry. 

 CERC has also urged the ministry to come up with guidelines for e-commerce to ensure that consumers are not misled or shortchanged by unscrupulous entities. The theme for this year’s Consumer Rights Day is ‘Better Digital World’.
 
 The idea is to address certain major issues including counterfeit products, and policies that are not consumer-friendly. Throwing more light on the effort, Pritee Shah, chief general manager, CERC, said, “None of the e-commerce portals have a mechanism to verify vendors and ensure that quality and genuine products are being delivered to consumers. We are well aware of cases of fake products being delivered.”
 
 Apart from this, Shah also emphasized on a better grievance redressal mechanism. “Having a customer care number is not enough. Every website should put up a prominently visible tab on all its web pages which links to a page that details various grievance redressal mechanisms, and who the consumer may approach in case of an issue,” said Shah, adding, “If e-commerce is expanding its reach to rural and semi-urban areas, they should ensure consumers are well educated of their rights are aware.”
