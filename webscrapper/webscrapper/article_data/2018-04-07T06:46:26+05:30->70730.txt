NOIDA: At least 90 buyers of a scrapped housing project have claimed refund cheques issued by the developer had been rejected by banks. A group of buyers said they would meet the developer on Saturday.

 Vandita, a project of around 1,400 flats by   in Sector 22D of the  , was cancelled by the builder. The protesters said at least 30-40% of the buyers were yet to be given their refund amounts, ranging between Rs 6.5 lakh and Rs 8.5 lakh 
 
 Sunworld had earlier said it had purchased 104 acres from YEIDA for Vandita. But instead of a continuous stretch of land, the developer was apparently given 65% in portions, which made it difficult for the project to be implemented despite launch and bookings. There haven’t been any disputes over the other projects of Sunworld, which include Vanalika, Arista, Sun World City and  .
 
 “We will meet the builder tomorrow and hopefully find some response from them. Too many assurances from them have yielded little,” said Sunil Gupta, a buyer whose cheque was rejected.
 
 Sunworld director   said: “We agree that some cheques have been dishonoured, but we are making RTGS transfers slowly. We will complete all payments in six months.”
