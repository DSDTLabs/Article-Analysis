CHANDIGARH: A total of 16 men were booked by   ( ) at Chandigarh   station for travelling in women-special coaches of various trains last week.

 Recently, the RPF has intensified its checking in the women-special coaches to ensure that no man boards them.
 
 According to the RPF, the men booked for the illegal act used to put forward the reason that other coaches of the trains were jam-packed whereas the women-special coaches had ample space. This is why they had boarded those coaches even though they knew it was illegal.
 
 All the long-route trains have a special coach each, which is only for women and disabled persons. It is placed just next to the cabin of the guard and has a capacity of 50 to 60 passengers.
 
 Rajesh Rana, SHO, RPF of Chandigarh railway station said these male passengers were booked under Section 162 of the Railway Act. The RPF staff are also sensitising the women passengers about the railway helpline number 182, on which they can make a call while on board. The RPF staff at the nearest station will act upon their complaint. Rana said the checking and awareness drive have been started a fortnight ago in all the trains.
 
 The security checks have been intensified after the Union railway minister   during 2018-19 budget announced that the focus of the railways this year will be on the safety and dignity of women passengers.
