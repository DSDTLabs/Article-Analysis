Following the massive success of MCA, Natural star   is now getting ready with his next release 
  
 . Helmed by   of 
  
  fame, the film has   and Rukshar Mir as the female leads. The movie features Nani in a dual role, that of a London based boy and another role will see him as a massy young man from Chittoor. Apparently, the film is being modeled along the lines of the yesteryear blockbuster 
  
 . One interesting aspect about this project is that Merlapaka Gandhi first approached   with the subject but the latter was not impressed by the script. Gandhi then approached Nani who green lit the project. While Hiphop Tamizha has been roped in as the music composer for the film, the cinematography is being handled by Karthik Ghattamaneni.
