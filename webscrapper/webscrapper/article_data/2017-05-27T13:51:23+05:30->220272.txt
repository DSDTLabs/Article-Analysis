NAGPUR: The   and   (NDCDA), which has over 3,500 chemists as its member, has announced that it would show solidarity with   and Druggists (AIOCD) and join the nationwide strike on May 30.

 The association is mainly up in arms against two things— the central health ministry’s proposal to regulate sale of drugs through e-portal and online pharmacies.
 
 About 8.5 lakh chemists from across the country, including 60,000 from   and 3,500 from Nagpur district, will take part in the strike.
 
 NDCDA president Mohan Abhyankar said, “The association had already dismissed the proposal of e-portal eight months ago, but the Centre did not react on it. It’s high time to lead the protest.”
 
 NDCDA secretary   said, “The move is impractical. The country doesn’t have sufficient IT infrastructure. Data connectivity across the periphery will be an issue.”
 
 Amit Agrawal of the association said, “The proposed e-portal and online pharmacies are sheer violation of the Drug and Cosmetic Act. As chemists, our duty is to supply drugs as and when needed. Patients can’t be stopped from getting drugs because of such technical issues.”
 
 Hetal Thakkar, another member of the association, said, “The e-portal will add tax to the medicine, which the consumers will ultimately bear. The government should have worked on policies to curtail medicine prize.”
 
 Talking about online pharmacies, the associations’ past secretary Vikram Vora said, “There are certain drugs we sell only through proper prescription. Same is not the case with online.”
