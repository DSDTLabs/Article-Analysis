NEW DELHI: Asserting that India’s   against   have had the “required effect” on Pakistan,   has asked the   government to curtail terror to improve ties. 

 Though the political resolution adopted by BJP at its national executive on Friday contained the warning that terrorism can invite “out of box” responses, the party also referred to PM Modi’s “together we grow” motto.
 
 The resolution, as expected ahead of important elections, was fulsome in praising the armed forces and claimed that the surgical strikes resulted in Pakistan calling for DGMO talks. But there was careful outreach as well. The resolution, however, had no references to China.
