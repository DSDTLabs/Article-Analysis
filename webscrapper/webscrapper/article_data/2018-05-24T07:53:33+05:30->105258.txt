AMRITSAR: Baba   of   on Wednesday began a plantation drive to give Amritsar a green cover. Speaking on the occasion, Sewa Singh said a total of 2,500 fruit tree saplings would be planted on the road stretch from Daburji to Jandiala. 

 He has so far planted saplings on over 382km road stretches in Punjab, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, and has been awarded Padma Shri by the Union government for his environmental efforts. Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla, who had played a key role in persuading Sewa Singh to help with the green cover campaign to the holy city, said, “Whenever I will fly out of Amritsar or land here, I saw depleting green cover and city gives a barren look so I decided to approach Sewa Singh for a plantation drive.”
 
 On the occasion, Amritsar deputy commissioner Kamaldeep Singh Sangha said in the first phase saplings would be planted on all the roads leading to the city, and that would be followed by interior parts.
