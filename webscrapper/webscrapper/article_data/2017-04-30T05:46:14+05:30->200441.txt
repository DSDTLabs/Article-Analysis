ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court suspended on Saturday the additional district and sessions court judge, Lucknow, Om Prakash Mishra, for granting bail to former UP minister and SP leader Gayatri Prajapati in a gang rape case. Mishra is set to retire on Sunday. 

 The judge had given the bail order on April 25, which was overturned by the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court on Friday. Mishra’s suspension was confirmed by D K Singh, registrar general of the high court. Besides suspending the judge, the high court’s administrative committee also seized Mishra’s powers after Chief Justice Dilip Babasaheb Bhosale took a grim view of the bail granted by him to Prajapati and his two accomplices in the gang rape case. Mishra was posted in the POCSO court in Lucknow. 
 
 A corporator had lodged an FIR with the Gautam Palli police station on February 18, 2017 alleging that Gayatri and his associates had raped her repeatedly since 2014. She also complained that they had molested her minor daughter. The FIR was registered only after the corporator moved the Supreme Court, seeking its intervention. 
 
 While staying Mishra’s order, Bhosale had observed: “…the manner in which he (Mishra) has shown haste in releasing the accused on bail ignoring the nature of offence and the fact that the crime came to be registered against these accused by virtue of the order of the Supreme Court passed on February 17, 2017, I have my reservations about the intention of the ASJ who is about to retire on April 30, 2017.” 
 
 A minister in the Akhilesh regime, Prajapati was arrested in Lucknow last month after being on the run for over two weeks. Prajapati had gone missing in the middle of campaigning for the UP assembly election after SC ordered the state police to file a case against him. Prajapati, who held plum portfolios in the state government, is also accused of patronising illegal mining, a charge which is being probed by the CBI.
