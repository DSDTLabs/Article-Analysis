HYDERABAD: Unlike the situation in the past couple of years, there is good news for devotees planning to go on the annual  . There is abundant water available in   and the government has agreed to release more water for the   to take their holy dip.

 About 20 lakh pilgrims are expected for this year’s Edupayal Jatara, which is considered the second biggest jatara after the  . Though the organising committee of the jatara has sought 0.3 TMC feet of water, officials in the irrigation department said more water would be released if needed.
 
 “There is no shortage of water as was the case last year. The water levels were at dead storage level in Singur last year. As on date, Singur has 24.4 TMC feet of water. Less than 0.3tmc ft of water each was released for the Jatara during the last two years. This time we are in a position to release as much as 0.5 TMC ft of water if needed,” said Padma Rao, Superintending Engineer, Irrigation, Sanga Reddy district.
 
 Irrigation officials said even if 0.5 tmc ft of water is released for Edupyala jatara, it will not go waste as it would feed the over 15000 acres of Ghanpur ayacut in its downstream.
 
 While the rains have brought copious inflows into Singur that is sufficient for drinking purposes even up to March 2018. Another major factor that has resulted in saving a whopping 5 tmc feet of water is the fact that all the drinking water supplies from this project to Greater Hyderabad have been stopped.
 
 Every day, at least 120 million gallons of water used to be pumped from Singur and supplied to Greater Hyderabad. Now, water from Krishna and Godavari projects is being supplied to Greater Hyderabad. The water in Singur has been kept for drinking and irrigation purposes of Medak, Sanga Reddy and neighbouring districts.
