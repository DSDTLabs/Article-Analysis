If your idea of celebrating Valentine's Day was some quiet time atop the picturesque Chamundi  , well, you have to replan it.
 
  Following incidents of robbery, drunken driving and more, authorities have raised safety concerns and will not allow couples to celebrate Valentine’s Day atop the hills. Speaking to us, Inspector of KR Police Station, Prakash says, “It is not a total ban for couples, but we will not let them to spend long amounts of time atop the hill as it is likely that miscreants may trouble them. Let them go to any other public place to celebrate. Even though Chamundi Hills is a tourist destination, it is predominantly a religious place, so visits to the area should be for that purpose only.”
  
  
 
  
  City police will conduct Operation Chamundi at various part of the Hills, like  , foothills, Tavare Katte, Nandi, Devi Vana and   over weekends to crack down on illegal activities, as the region teems with visitors at this time.
