HYDERABAD: If everything goes according to plan, Hyderabad will have electric charging stations across the city in the next two years.

The tariff will be decided by the   (ERC) after talks with representatives from the automobile sector and the public. To meet the daily demand, there must be a charging station at every 40-70 kilometres.

The transport department is studying the experiments by DLF, which offered free charging at some locations, and Mahindra, which entered into an agreement with a private shopping mall chain to set up free charging points in retail centres.
