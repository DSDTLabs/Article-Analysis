NEW DELHI: The Delhi government's plan to procure 1,000 electric buses is likely to get the cabinet's nod very soon. 

 A cabinet note for the proposal has been prepared by the transport department and has been vetted by different departments including finance and planning. The proposal to procure the buses through the cluster scheme or   (DTC) is going to be presented before the council of ministers in the next cabinet meeting. 
 
 The plan was announced by deputy chief minister   in his budget speech in March. As per the timeline fixed for the procurement of electric buses, the proposal was expected be approved by the council of ministers by April 30 but that deadline was missed as a cabinet meeting has not taken place of late.
 
 "A consultant would also be roped in for procuring these buses," a Delhi government official said. As per the timeline, a consultant is scheduled to be appointed by June 1.
 
  Delhi's transport minister Kailash Gahlot said that the cabinet note for procurement is being reviewed by different Delhi government departments at present. 
 
 The government plans to float tenders for the same by this July and expects the first lot of the buses to start rolling out from March 31, 2019.
 
 The transport department has also zeroed down on the bus depots where the required infrastructure to park the first lot of the buses would come up. "We have decided to use bus depots at   and   to park these buses. The major reason behind choosing the locations was the availability of sufficient power supply," the official said.
