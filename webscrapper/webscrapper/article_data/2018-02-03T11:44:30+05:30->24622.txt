CHANDIGARH: The   branch of the municipal corporation ( ) on Friday issued attachment notices against   units in Industrial Area, Phase I, for not paying property tax in a first of its kind action.

 Owners of the two   (numbers 31 and 35) have been given 15 days to remove their material and belongings.
 
 The industrial unit number 31 was told to pay Rs 19.26 lakh and the other Rs 12.10 lakh.
 
 Ani Kumar Garg, additional municipal commissioner, who heads the tax branch of the MC, said, “We gave ample time to both the industrial units to pay their property taxes. We were left with no option but to issue the orders.” A MC official said one of the units’ occupants was even given a hearing to pay the tax, but still no payment was made.
 
 Recently, the civic body had sealed some commercial units in prominent locations, one of them in Sector 7.
 
 Since incurring property tax is one of the key means for the MC to generate its income, the civic body is focussing on this aspect for past few months. Earlier, the authority had been sending the property tax notices only to commercial and residential property owners. Now, it has identified industrial units too.
