CHENNAI: Chief minister   on Tuesday sought the intervention of Prime Minister   in securing the immediate release of five fishermen from Sri Lanka and the traditional fishing boats. The fishermen were apprehended on April 30. The CM also sought the release of 133 fishing boats already in Lankan custody. 

 The fishermen, who set sail in a traditional fishing craft from Pamban fishing base of Ramanathapuram district, were apprehended by the Sri   and taken to   before being remanded in judicial custody. "It is unfortunate that the Sri Lankan government continues to intimidate the Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu who eke out a livelihood through traditional fishing methods," Palaniswami said in a letter to Modi.
 
 The CM said such detention of fishermen who were fishing in a small traditional (vallam) boat, in their customary fishing ground in the Palk Bay can only hinder attempts to sort out the issue. "It also sends out a demoralizing message to fishermen of Tamil Nadu," Palaniswami said, urging the PM to take up the matter at the highest diplomatic level.
