AGRA: BSP’s Mathura candidate,  , on Sunday landed himself in trouble after he posted his selfie with an EVM on social media. The Election Commission is all set to register a case against Diwedi for allegedly violating the model code of conduct by posting the photograph, which purportedly shows him pressing the button next to his party symbol.
 
 Confirming the move, ADM, Mathura, Ravindra Kumar said that the candidate had uploaded a picture of an EVM machine with his finger pressing the party’s poll symbol, which violates the election code of conduct. He said according to the guidelines, mobile phones are not allowed inside the polling booth and hence the candidate had also committed a breach of security. Kumar told TOI that Mathura Returning Officer (RO) had been directed to register an FIR against the candidate.
  
 When contacted, Divedi however claimed that the “so-called selfie” that he uploaded wasn’t clicked by him. “I had posted a collage of some pictures on my Facebook page stating that my wife and I had cast our vote. One of the pictures in the collage, showing a finger next to the BSP party symbol, was received by me on WhatsApp and I posted that too”, he said.
  
 Admitting that he had committed a mistake inadvertently, Diwedi said he would file his response to the EC, as and when he receives a notice.
