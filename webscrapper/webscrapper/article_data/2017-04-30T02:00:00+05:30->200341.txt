PATNA: Police on Friday night arrested one Mohammad Bashir Ahmed (39) outside Patna junction and recovered from his possession the rare   which was looted from the ground floor flat of Baban Chaubey in Purnodaya Apartment at Nageshwar Colony under Kotwali police station area on March 26. 

 City SP (Central) Chandan Kumar Kushwaha said police were tracking several persons through technical surveillance after the incident. “Police traced Bashir in Mumbai. Monitoring his mobile phone, police came to know that he was returning by train to Patna. He was nabbed at Patna Junction,” said Kushwaha, adding that he tried to sell the ruby in Mumbai market but failed as he was not carrying its ownership document. 
 
 The ruby, owned by a retired excise department inspector Qul Kant, was kept with Baban, his close friend, for safety reasons. On March 26, Mushtaq Khan with four others entered Baban’s flat and looted the ruby, some cash and jewellery on gunpoint. The ruby, estimated to be worth at least Rs6 crore in 1998 by experts at Gen Testing Laboratory in Kolkata, was the ancestral property of Kant.
 
 However, police were yet to arrest Mushtaq, the prime accused in the case. “Mushtaq, soon after the incident, had fled to Mumbai to sell the ruby. After he failed, Mushtaq handed it over to Bashir for searching a customer,” said the SP, adding that Mushtaq, Baban and Bashir were known to each other.
 
 Mushtaq and Baban had taken Rs15 lakh from Bashir almost two years back, he added.
 
 Bashir said he was called by Mushtaq to Mumbai where he was handed over the gem on April 24. “He told me to hand over the gem to Baban who will return my money with interest,” said Bashir, who is in real estate business. He is a native of Samanpura under Shastri Nagar police station.
