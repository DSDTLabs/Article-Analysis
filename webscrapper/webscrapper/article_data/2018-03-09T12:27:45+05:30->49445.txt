NAGPUR: A three-day Akhil Bhartiya Pratinidhi Sabha — a meeting of representatives of the Sangh Parivar — will be held in the city from Friday. There is a buzz that Karnataka’s Dattatarey   may replace Bhaiyyaji   as the RSS sarkaryavaha (general secretary). The sarkaryavaha runs the day-to-day affairs of the organization with the Sarsangh Sanchalak, or the chief, having more of a patron’s role. 

 The Sabha is held each year at different locations and every third year it is in Nagpur when the proposal of changing the general secretary is discussed. Though the tenure is for three years, an extension is usually given to the incumbent.
 
 Bhaiyyaji Joshi has been the secretary for the last 9 years. Hosbale may get a look-in as RSS has an eye on the forthcoming Karnataka elections which is currently governed by a   government.
 
 The meet will be attended by BJP president Amit Shah and 1,500 representatives of various units of the Sangh Parivar. Joshi has risen from the RSS ranks while Hosabale has roots in the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) which, thus, makes him more politically experienced worker.
 
 RSS spokesperson   did not comment on the issue at the press conference held on Thursday to announce the meeting.
 
 Vaidya said people’s interest in RSS has increased over the years. The ‘join RSS’ icon on the organization’s website was clicked by 1.25 lakh person during 2017.
 
 In 2013, there were 78,000 clicks. The yearly average between 2014 and 2016 was 90,000.
 
 The Rashtrodyaya Sammelan held in   recently was attended by 70,000 person of less than 30 years of age, informed Vaidya. “There were 31,000 in the age-group of 30 to 40 years; 25,000 in 40-50 years age bracket and 12,000 who were less than 60 years of age. 12 persons in their 90s attended the meet too. Similar events in Karnataka and   were attended by over 40,000 persons,” he added.
