JAIPUR:   (RSCW) on Friday set-up a team to probe the death of 18-year-old Komal Prajapat, a first year student of Maharani’s College who was found hanging in her hostel room on Thursday. A team of RSCW took statements of faculty, students and also examined record books of the hostel.

 “We have set-up a team to investigate all aspects surrounding Komal’s death. The allegations made by her are also being probed,” RSCW chairperson   told TOI. Sharma visited Maharani’s College in the morning and spoke to college principal, hostel warden and other students.
 
 The special team of women commission took several documents into its passion to check reasons behind Komal’s death. “We would speak to students of hostel and warden to probe if Komal was in distress. She was a meritorious student and a probe is warranted in the case,” Sharma said.
 
 Sources told TOI that an address which was recovered from her room needs to be probed as it could provide important clues about Komal’s death. 
 
 Meanwhile, Ashok Nagar police on Friday claimed that nothing suspicious was found from Komal’s call details records (CDRs). “We examined all numbers mentioned in the CDR but didn’t find anything conclusive. There are some other numbers which are yet to be examined but we haven’t come across any pattern which could broaden scope of our investigation,” a senior police official told TOI.
 
 Police are now banking on a torn up page that was recovered from Komal’s register which cops suspect to be the suicide note. The page starts with “I am Komal Prajapat” but cannot be read fully as it’s torn up from several places. The page has been sent to forensic science laboratory (FSL) for impression.
 
 While mystery over Komal’s death is yet to be solved, students of Maharani’s College continued their protest on demand of withdrawing FIR by Komal’s parents.
