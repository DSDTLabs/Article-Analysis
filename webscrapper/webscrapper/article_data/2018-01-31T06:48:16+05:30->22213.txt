AHMEDABAD: A major fire in a   passing near railway tracks forced the railways to   toward Sabarmati railway station. The fire began in the cable duct.

  
  Railway officials deputed a team of four high-level technical officers of Ahmedabad Division to inquire into the incident. Fire officials said it is very likely that garbage and other waste may have accumulated near the dead cable and caught fire, resulting in the incident. Railway officials said that because of the fire, train movements from Sabarmati and toward Sabarmati railway station were affected. Several trains to Rajkot and Delhi were affected. Ashram Express, scheduled to leave Ahmedabad station at 6.30pm, was nearly one hour late. Railway officials said the track was found fit for use at around 7.15 pm after which train movements re-started. The   intercity departing at 8.10pm and the Gandhinagar-Indore train, which was to depart Sabarmati at 7.01pm were late by around 18 minutes. Jayesh Khadia, deputy chief fire officer, said the fire started in the electric cables laid below the railway track. “We consulted railway and electricity company authorities to understand the mechanism and then started the operation. The flames were doused in half an hour,” he said.
