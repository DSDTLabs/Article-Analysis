Panaji: Chairperson, North Goa planning and development authority (NGPDA), Michael Lobo, said the Kadamba plateau which forms part of Cumbharjua constituency has to be earmarked as a separate Outline Development Plan (ODP) area.  He would make such a proposal to the government, Lobo said addressing a press conference on Monday. Currently, the floor area ratio (FAR) applicable to the Kadamba plateau is 50, but after making it a separate ODP, they would be able to offer an increased FAR. “For residential units, we want to give FAR of 80 and commercial units 100,” said Lobo. Replying to a question, he said the draft ODP for Calangute is ready and new areas of Arpora, Nagoa and Parra have been added to it. These areas will similarly benefit from an increased FAR. “Locals want to build guesthouses,” said Lobo, explaining why NGPDA has decided to offer increased FAR to the newly-added areas. Lobo said they are in the process of moving a file seeking extension of 60 days to finalize ODPs. “The file is ready to be sent to the government,” said Lobo. Lobo said due to the panchayat election code of conduct that remained in force last month, he said they could not receive suggestions for ODPs and the NGPDA wants more time to complete the process. As regards to Panaji ODP, he said the NGPDA is open to review it as demanded by the councillors of the Corporation of the city (CCP) of Panaji, but subject to approval of the government. Lobo clarified that the court has not issued them any order to so.  Some CCP councilors went to court complaining that the ODP for Panaji was drafted without consulting them. “We have pictorial evidence to show that they had been consulted,” said Lobo.  If government gives in to the demand by NGPDA, the finalization of the ODPs is likely to be delayed.
