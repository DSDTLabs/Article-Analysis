Pune: The Sardar Vallabhabai Patel Cantonment General Hospital is set to provide better healthcare services with new facilities.

 Southern Army Commander Lt Gen D R Soni on Tuesday inaugurated a newly developed  , an extended outpatient department (OPD) with additional space for diagnosis and treatment, and a dialysis centre at the hospital in the presence of Pune Cantonment Board’s (PCB) chief executive officer D N Yadav, defence estate officer Rajendra Pawar and other board members.
 
 Yadav said, “The hospital’s existing OPD building was in need of expansion for visits of specialized doctors. The board extended the general OPD by providing three additional rooms for the specialists. General physicians from Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) will provide their services on a daily basis and super specialists, including endocrinologist, nephrologist, rheumatologist, chest physician and cardiologist, will visit on weekly basis.”
 
 The hospital with 100 beds caters to the healthcare requirements of people not only from the cantonment limits but also from the adjoining municipal areas. The existing OPD has 21 honorary doctors, including a few from AFMC.
 
 Yadav said, “There was a long-standing demand from people for an upgrade of the existing diagnostic therapeutic facility in the hospital. As such, a dialysis centre has been set up on the guidelines prescribed by the directorate-general of health services. The A K Abdujee Trust has donated five dialysis machines for this centre.”
