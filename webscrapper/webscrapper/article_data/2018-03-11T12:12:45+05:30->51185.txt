PANAJI: The   (TET) notification can be expected in September or October this year, director of education G P Bhat said. Goa is already eight years behind in conducting the TET as required by the Right to Education Act, 2009, and remains among the small minority of states and union territories not to have held it. 

 There are close to 100 primary school teacher vacancies in state-run institutions itself. Between 500 and 800 graduates from DEd and BEd institutes across Goa are expected to appear when Goaâ€™s first TET is held. 
 
 The TET is expected to bring national standards and set a benchmark for teacher quality in the recruitment process, and is meant to motivate teacher education institutions and students from these institutions to further improve their performance standards.
 
 According to central government norms, the state government will have to conduct the TET at least once a year and the certification will be valid for a minimum of seven years.
