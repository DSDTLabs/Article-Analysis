Ali Asgar, who is all set to tickle the funny bones of the audiences with a new show  , spoke about the reason he left   and said Kapil will always be his friend. 

 "There are a lot of things which we can't discuss publicly. All I can say is that Kapil is, was and will always be my friend. Sometimes its nice to remain silent as it is not the right time to talk about certain issues and things might get worse if you talk about it. So I never felt of talking about it. If I was not here for The Drama Company launch this topic would have gone with me to my grave," said  . 
 
 Ali also spoke about how creative differences and his health issues made him quit The   Show.
 
  
  
 "Kapil has been my colleague for last four years and I am not giving any explanation with the intention to harm someone. It is just a creative difference that happened and as a professional I took the decision to leave   and also informed the creative team. I told them as my contract is coming to an end, I don't want to renew it. Also I was not well by the time I felt better my contract got over. If I would have been lying, the channel would have never accepted my explanation. Kapil also felt it was justified. And I never felt of giving an explanation to anyone as to why I left the show," explained Ali.
 
 Ali has no qualms working with Kapil again. In fact the actor wishes that the latter offers him a good role someday, "I don't have any personal fight with Kapil Sharma and I would love to work with him again. I wish he offers me a lovely character one day," shared the actor who is popular for playing nani on TKSS.
 
 When asked if he spoke to Kapil after the latter fainted on the sets, Ali stated, "Yes, I messaged him saying Get well soon and he replied to it. I could not go and meet him as I was busy with the rehearsals of The Drama Company."
