CHANDIGARH: Rakesh Bharti Mitttal, vice-chairman,  , and CII president, on Saturday said he was pained to see   become a laggard on every front.

 “It pains me to see that we have lost glory on economic front, agricultural front, food front and basically on every front. I think it is your responsibility to resolve this. You are the future of India, you have to carry forward the flame of Punjab. India comes first but since you have done your graduation from this land, this is the debt that you owe,”   told students at the convocation of University Institute of Engineering and Technology ( ) at law auditorium on Saturday.
 
 
  
 
 He said states need to be ranked in terms of agriculture. “As the president of CII, one thing that I have asked NITI Aayog to start is ranking states in terms of agriculture. I think this is the next big reform this country needs to see, especially when I am here in Punjab, which is an agrarian state,” said Mittal.
 
 Talking about the education sector, Mittal said the time has come the universities talk about the future of jobs, revise curriculum and invest more on research. “We must look at investing more on research. Industry has been lagging far behind in putting money on research and development. Globally, large corporations engage with universities and educational institutions but simultaneously, educational institutions have not done a good job,” Mittal said.
 
 When industry wants to give money for research, they want to be partner with it. Mittal said the time has come when industry-academia linkages need to become strong. Industry’s responsibility is to provide funding for research and development. The industry and academia should sit across the table to review the curriculum and provide internships to the students, he added.
