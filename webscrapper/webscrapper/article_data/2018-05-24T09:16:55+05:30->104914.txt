JAIPUR: The urban development and housing ( ) department has decided to provide relaxations under its freehold deed scheme.

 A year ago, the government had introduced freehold system for land ownership in the state. However, no land owner till date has applied for freehold deeds. Now to promote the new system, the department has announced that owners having freehold deeds will not have to take construction permission from urban local bodies or development authorities for first seven years.
 
 These owners will have to carry out construction on their land within seven years after the deed is issued. In case, the owners fail to adhere to the deadline, they will have to deposit fixed charges to receive permission for construction on their plots from urban local bodies or development authorities.
 
 A senior UDH official said, “If holders fail to construct house or shop within 12 years, the freehold deed will be cancelled. For first seven years, the owners will not have to take any permission. However, if they fail, construction will be allowed for another five years with permission from local bodies and development authorities after the owners deposit 1% of the reserve price. After 12 years, the freehold deed will be cancelled and it can only be reinstated with state government’s permission.”
