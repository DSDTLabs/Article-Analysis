HYDERABAD: Despite the   forbidding levying of parking fees at malls and multiplexes and courts frowning upon it, managements continue to fleece customers, with some even finding new ways to do so.

 After   were booked last year, some malls, instead of issuing bills started using smart cards to implement a token system to collect money, while others still blatantly issue tickets.
 
 As per Section 115 (40) of the   Act, parking places or common areas in a multi-storied commercial complex are a ‘public place’, and no fees can be levied for parking. Besides this, a judgment of the High Court on May 2, 2003, stated that parking fees are illegal.
 
  
 Vijay Gopal, president of   — who has been fighting against illegal collection of parking fees — told TOI, “It is illegal to collect parking fees both at malls and theatres. After criminal cases were booked, the public started asking managements to show what permission they had for collecting such fees. Managements don’t collect fees from people who are questioning them, but others are being charged. A PIL on the issue is pending in the High Court. I have filed six FIRs against several malls and they are at the investigation stage. No arrests have been made as yet in these cases.”
 
 P M Sai Prasad, an RTI activist and   leader, said, the GHMC is the only authorised agency to collect parking fee. “But it appears to be unperturbed at the plight of the public. Authorities, politicians and parking operators are working hand-in-glove to fleece people. If not addressed, we will launch a street protest in front of malls, multiplexes and corporate hospitals,” he said.
