BENGALURU: A 57-year-old woman was found murdered at her home in Jayanagar 9th Block in south Bengaluru on Wednesday morning. 

 Mani Venkatesh's murder came to light when her only son,  , 37, called his friend saying his room was locked from outside and his mother wasn't  .
 
  "My friend who lives near Tilaknagar came around 12.30pm and opened the door to my room. We went to our mother's room and were shocked to see her lying dead near the cupboard," Kishore, a bachelor, told police. 
 
 A consultant with a software company, Kishore works from home. Mani's husband died in 2014. The mother and son lived in the two-bedroom, rented house on the first floor. The family had moved Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh to Bengaluru in 2015.
 
 Police said she may have been smothered to death with a pillow. "Valuables on her body, including a gold chain, ornaments and cash in the cupboard are intact which indicate it's not a murder for gain," a senior police officer said.
 
 "I last saw my mother around 12.30 m and she was watching TV when I went to my room to sleep. I woke up late in the morning like I do every day. I was talking to my friends and stayed in my room for a long time. When I tried to come out, I found the door locked from outside. When my mother did not respond to my calls, I called up my friend," Kishore told police. 
 
 Preliminary investigation revealed the assailant entered the house by removing window panes and then opened the main door. Police suspect an old rivalry led to the murder.
