AGARTALA: The opposition   on Friday burnt an effigy of   Chief Minister   demanding his resignation and held the state government responsible for termination of 10,323 teachers.

 The party today organised a procession, which passed through different parts of the city and later congregated at RMS Chowmuhani here, where the effigy was burnt.
 
 The Supreme Court on March 29 had upheld a Tripura High Court order terminating the jobs of 10,323 government teachers in the state on the plea that the recruitment process was faulty.
 
 "Tripura High Court had ordered the termination the teachers in 2014 on grounds that the recruitment process was faulty. The Supreme Court has upheld the High Court judgement.
 
 "This is the fault of the state government and not of those who lost jobs,"   state president Asish Saha told reporters after the programme.
 
 Saha said the TMC was also demanding publication of a white paper on the issue.
 
 "The guidelines and rules amended three times by the state government from 2012 to 2015 were full of mistakes. The CPI(M) and the Left Front government always cheated the youths and they must take responsibility. It is the question of livelihood for the families of the terminated teachers," he said.
 
 Addressing a gathering today, CPI(M) state secretary Bijan Dhar said the state government would always remain with the teachers who lost their jobs and would make an all-out effort to help them.
 
 "The verdict of the apex court has come as a shock to every people of the state. We will always remain by the side of the teachers who lost their jobs and their families," Dhar said.
 
 The Supreme Court in its order had stated that the teachers would work till December 31 and asked the state government to start the process of recruitment of teachers by May following the guidelines of the NCET.
