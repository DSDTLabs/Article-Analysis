JALANDHAR: With the newly formed   government announcing a war on drugs, Congress MLAs have started giving similar statements at thanksgiving meetings: that they will not entertain any “sifarish” (plea) for people accused of drug peddling, even if they belong to the Congress.

 When irrigation and power minister Rana Gurjit Singh returned to his constituency,  , on Sunday and addressed a thanksgiving meeting, he was quite blunt in telling people that none should come up with such a request. “No one will be spared. I will not ask the police for any favours in such cases. Drug peddlers should take this as a last warning and they should immediately leave the trade,” he said.
 
  has also been telling people that his policy would be rock solid on the matter. “My policy is same on the issue. No such please will be entertained,” the former hockey icon has been telling people at the public meetings.
 
  has also been telling constituents that even if somebody owing allegiance to the Congress was caught, he or his family should not expect leniency. “From me, it is last warning to one and all,” he has been saying at his meetings.
 
 Sultanpur Lodhi MLA   has also made “no sifarish for drug peddlers” a tag line in his speeches. “If anybody is involved, he should immediately give up the trade or should be ready to spend a good part of his life in jail,” he said during his speeches in different villages of the constituency on Saturday and Sunday.
 
 Patti MLA Harminder Singh Gill, in his thanksgiving speech, also gave a similar warning and asked doctors at the local civil hospital to make all arrangements, as addicts would rush to them when the supply of drugs would be squeezed.
