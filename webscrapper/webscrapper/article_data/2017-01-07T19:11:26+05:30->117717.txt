PATNA: Bihar’s ruling JD (U) on Friday ruled out any reunion with   and said the speculation about it after the bonhomie between PM   and CM Nitish Kumar seen during the Prakashotsava celebrations on Thursday at Gandhi Maidan was only a media creation.

 “It’s all media creation. No chance of any pact with the BJP,” JD (U) chief spokesperson and MLC Sanjay Singh told TOI on Friday. 
 
 Singh said praising the head of a government for his good work does not mean any political realignment.
 
 PM on Thursday praised Nitish for liquor ban in Bihar and called it a “courageous step”. Modi’s praise for   came after he backed the PM’s demonetisation move in November last year despite the JD (U) allies — Congress and Lalu Prasad’s RJD — trained their guns on the Centre over the surprise decision. 
 
 The two previous partners in the NDA famously fell out after Modi was elevated as the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
 
 The last time Modi and Nitish were publicly seen like friends was at a public rally hosted by Punjab CM   in Jalandhar in 2009. A year later, in June 2010, when the same picture reappeared in Bihar dailies, Nitish became annoyed against Modi, who was in Patna with the top BJP leadership to attend a national executive meeting. Nitish had then cancelled a dinner he was to host for the BJP leaders. 
 
 The bonhomie between the two friends-turned-foes was first seen in August 2016 when Nitish had gone to meet Modi in Delhi to seek central assistance for relief and rehabilitation of flood-affected people. It was also an occasion for Nitish to appreciate and endorse Modi’s Namani Gange programme. Earlier in 2010, Nitish had returned a Rs 5 crore cheque to Modi, who was then the Gujarat CM.
