NEW DELHI: Railway minister   has said he has no conflict of interest in   and that inter company loans from   to   were taken on commercial terms and tax deducted and paid on interest regularly. Responding to the allegations levelled by  , a statement on behalf of Goyal said the judicial proceedings of national company law tribunal in fact clearly highlight the transparent process adopted for turning around the company Shirdi Industries.

 
 Congress had claimed that the loan to Intercon Advisors reflected a conflict of interest as the latter is associated with Goyal's wife. "The loan from Asis Industries to Intercon Advisors was not given in 2015-16 as alleged by Congress but on 24 September, 2012, a good two years after Goyal left the company, and was taken in the normal course of lending from Asis Industries at interest of 12% per annum which was higher than prevailing market rates," the statement said.
 
 Congress cannot distinguish between a pure commercial transaction and corrupt practices regularly indulged in by the party and its leaders. "The malicious statement by Congress about Goyal factually misleads and makes incorrect conclusions and is full of factual inaccuracies, mixes up of dates and alludes to events with no relevance to Goyal's brief association with Shirdi Industries," the statement said.
 
 There was no fresh loan of Rs 258.62 crore approved as claimed by Congress as this was an enhancement of existing loans from Rs 181.82 crore (increased by 40 % in the normal course of business). "Goyal was neither an MP nor director of State Bank of India (SBI) at the time of enhancement. There is no question of Goyal influencing this loan enhancement."
 
 Issues after 2010 in Shirdi Industries have nothing to do with Goyal as he has no role in the company after 1 July, 2010 and any distress relates to 2013 when Congress was in office.
