LUCKNOW: BJP chief Amit   on Wednesday paid homage to Dalit social reformer Jyotiba   on his 191st birth anniversary, in Lucknow, in an attempt to pacify party’s Dalit MPs who have accused the Uttar Pradesh government of failing to stop atrocities on the community. This was the first visit to the statue by a BJP leader.

 The statue was installed by the   government. Shah, accompanied by chief minister   and state BJP chief  , offered flowers at the 15-feet-tall statue. Shah tweeted: “The ideas of works of   will continue to inspire us.’’ Last week, Shah had said the BJP government would never scrap job reservation for Dalits.
 
 
 Shah’s visit to Phule’s statue is seen as an attempt to dispel growing perception about BJP being an anti-Dalit party. At least four Dalit MPs of the party have criticised the leadership over attacks on members of the community after the April 2 agitation against the Supreme Court ruling on the SC/ST Act.
