NAVI MUMBAI: The   created commotion in the general body meeting on Friday over NMMC’s exclusion in the new comprehensive and integrated development control regulations (DCR) being drafted by the state. The new DCR is for civic bodies in   and last day for suggestions and objections is May 30.

 Vashi corporator Kishor Patkar notified the house about the exclusion. He said that until eight months ago, when the drafting process was underway, NMMC was included i n the list. “But now when the DCR is days away from becoming a legislation, NMMC is not in the list. This is alarming as the new DCR is key to every development issue, be it slum rehabilitation or even private buildings not having 2.5 FSI,” he said.
 
 They are accusing civic chief Tukaram Mundhe of acting against the city’s interest. “Like every other civic commissioner, Mundhe was also a member, so it is unlikely that he was not aware about the exclusion but he seem to have chosen to act otherwise,” said Patkar.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner Ankush Chavan said they would notify the state urban development department about the issue.
 
 But a senior town planner said that the civic body was excluded on technical grounds. “The comprehensive DCR is essentially meant for freehold property but Navi Mumbai is leased by  , wherein everything is already planned. The initial naming was an error, therefore was rectified as the city is already having DCR sanctioned by government in 2008,” he said.
