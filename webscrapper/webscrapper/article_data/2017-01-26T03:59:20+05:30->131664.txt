NEW DELHI: In a relief to candidates contesting the  , the EC on Wednesday requested RBI to hike the weekly limit for withdrawals from their   accounts to Rs 2 lakh from Rs 24,000 imposed for all in view of the  .

 Stating that it had been apprised about the problems being faced by candidates due to imposition of limits on withdrawal of cash from banks, the EC conceded that given that the entire election process lasts only 3-4 weeks, the total amount that can be withdrawn with the weekly restriction limit of Rs 24,000 would be only Rs 96,000, as against the statutory limit of expenditure of Rs 28 lakh for Punjab, Uttarakhand and UP and Rs 20 lakh for Manipur and Goa.
 
 A candidate must open a separate and designated bank account for his poll expenses, from which all his receipts and payments must be routed during polls.
 
 “Even considering that part of the expenditure would be incurred through cheque, petty and recurring expenditure is generally incurred in cash. The issue is further adversely compounded in rural areas where banking facilities are not available or are negligible. 
 
 “Therefore, it is requested that withdrawal limits for nominated candidates, as certified by the returning officer of a particular constituency, may be enhanced to Rs 2 lakh per week. This enhanced limit may be kept in place only till the date of declaration of results, i.e., 11th March, 2017,” the EC said in its letter addressed to RBI governor.
