NEW DELHI: Former Union minister P   today got protection from arrest by the CBI until July 3 in the INX Media Case.

 
 Yesterday, Chidambaram had moved a Delhi court seeking protection from arrest in the   money laundering case. The senior Congress leader moved his plea for anticipatory bail before Special Judge O P  , who directed Chidambaram to appear before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on June 5 as already summoned by the agency.
 
 The court, which issued notice to the ED seeking its reply by June 5, also directed the agency not to take any coercive action against Chidambaram in the matter till then.
 
 Senior advocates Kapil Sibal and  , appearing for Chidambaram, urged the court to grant him the relief considering the former minister has clean antecedents and deep roots in society.
 
 In his plea, Chidambaram said all the evidence in the matter appears to be documentary in nature which is already in the possession of the incumbent government and nothing was to be recovered from him.
 
 However, special public proseutor  , appearing for the ED, opposed Chidambaram's plea saying he did not join the investigation today, for which the ED had already issued summons.
