India is addictive. You might feel oblivious being an Indian here but ask  , the stand-up comedian and magician from the US who recently visited Hyderabad, and he will tell you how awed he was about the country.
“Everything here — the weather, smells, traffic chaos — is like the Philippines. People are lively, humorous and very talkative. Being a foodie, I like the spicy food, especially the tasty chuttneys, rotis and kebabs,” the 32-year-old from Los Angeles says. 
 The   contestant recently tickled the funny bones of Hyderabadis and is of the opinion that we Indians enjoy an advantage over the West when it comes to humour. “Comedians enjoy a lot of space in Indian movies, and I really enjoyed the slapstick comedy of Bollywood; it was just hilarious,” says the multifaceted artiste.
 He also praised his audience for their ability to connect with the performer adding that that he is interested in acting in Bollywood if he gets some good offers. “I got a lot of offers after I appeared in America’s Got Talent. The caricatures I did of Asian immigrants for the American TV, and the adult comedy roles I played for   are close to my heart,” he says.
 Talking about his 15-year-long career as a comedian, Justin says that it is very hard and competitive to make a successful career as a comedian in the US, but growing up in the multicultural environment of Los Angeles, helped him hone his artistry. “LA has a lot of theatre clubs, which actually shaped the comedian in me. After I completed my junior college, I realised that acting is my thing and devoted all my energy to realise my dreams. Yes, I struggled a lot, but I am happy for what I am today,” says Rivera, whose repertoire of jokes predominantly revolved around adult humour.
