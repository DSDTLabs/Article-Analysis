 Confirming this, a spokesperson of the   said that the resignation submitted by Phoolka was under consideration. AAP, which is the main opposition party in Punjab, has not given any alternate name for the post of leader of opposition.
 
 Meanwhile, Phoolka has said that he has suggested three names to the party leadership â€“ Sukhpal Singh Khaira, Kanwar Sandhu and Aman Arora. Even as  , leader of AAP ally Lok Insaaf Party (LIP), too has made his presence left during the budget session, he is believed to have put his weight behind Khaira. Arora already holds the post of co-convener of the Punjab unit and has been entrusted with the task of restructuring the state unit.
 
 There has been speculation that AAP could urge MLAs brothers, Simarjit and Balwinder Bains, to merge LIP with AAP and one of them could be appointed to the post.
