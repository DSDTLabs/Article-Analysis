Animal prints have moved away from their sexy tag. The new fauna fashion is all about being playful and eccentric. Here’s how to make it yours.
 
  With the ’80s making a major comeback last year, there’s been a style stampede of fauna in fashion. “After fashionable felines, designers are now expanding their animal stock. This season, you’ll spot animals that are a lot more graphic, magnified and quirky,” says designer Aniket Satam. While Gucci brings together roaring tigers, slithery snakes and butterflies, Stella McCartney spreads the message of elegance through multiple, monochrome swans. Back home, designer Ankita Chaudhary evokes exuberance with vibrant and spunky parrots, fish and bulls.

  Keep the look balanced, not busy. Wear an eye-catching animal-print cap or scarf for a casual day out. For the evening, go for faux leopard print stilettos to work the style
  
  
 
  -Never dress in animal print head to toe.
  -Don’t mix two animal prints. Always add a graphic print with an animal print and keep a common colour.
  -Leather and animal print go well with each other, but make sure you don’t overdo the whole safari theme and end up looking like a long-lost relative of Tarzan.
  -Don’t go for animal-skin patterned eyeshadow. Stick to cateye or winged eyeliner to get a ‘wild’ look.
