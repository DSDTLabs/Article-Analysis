 recently set a lot of tongues wagging when he posted groupies with his former colleagues   and   on the set of their supernatural TV show. Soon, telly town was abuzz with rumours that the actor, who is currently playing the lead in a TV soap, and will also be seen in a dance reality show, will return to 'Naagin 2'. Considering the fact that he was part of the show’s first season, speculations were rife about him returning to the ongoing one. 
However, sources refute the rumour. “Arjun regularly visits his friends Mouni and Adaa, but this time, people thought that he might be returning to the show. It is not true. Arjun is busy juggling two other shows and he is certainly not returning to 'Naagin 2'.”
