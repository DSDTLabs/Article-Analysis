JODHPUR: The environs of the   will now reverberate with the roar of tigers. A couple of   from the   that landed at the Jodhpur park on Thursday, will now be added to the list of animals in the park.

 The pair of Royal Bengal tigers namely Anthony and Ambika were sanctioned to be brought to Jodhpur in exchange of two male and four female Indian gazelles and a male and two female wolves. A pair of Indian palm civets and two pairs of porcupines have also been brought to Jodhpur from Kanpur zoo.
 
 Veterinarian of the park, Sharavan Singh Rathore said that this pair of Bengal tiger started from Kanpur Zoological Park along with a team of seven members led by senior vet   on Wednesday in a special vehicle, which reached the park on Thursday morning.
 
 “We have accommodated them in the enclosure meant for the tigers. Though, they have been behaving like strangers to the place but would be accustomed to the atmosphere in two to three days,” said the vet.
 
 The park currently has a pair of asiatic lions named GS and RT with their three cubs- Kailash, Riyaz and Laxmi. But tigers had constantly been missing in the park and visitors also started inquiring from the park administration about the empty enclosure of the tigers.
 
 According to a forest official, “Sanction under the wildlife animals exchange scheme had been given by the   last week and the moment this sanction was granted, we began working on preparing the enclosure for the tigers and other animals at our park.” 
 
 “We are happy that we have a pair of Bengal tigers in our park now, which both the park and the visitors had been missing for the past seven years. This addition would certainly add to the excitement of the visitors and the wildlife lovers and would also increase the footfall in the park,” the official said.
