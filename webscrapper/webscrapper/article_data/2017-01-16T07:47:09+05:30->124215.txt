PUNE: For the first time, the   (PMC) has planned to upload video clips related to every candidate on its website so as to give aspirants an opportunity to explain her/his vision for the area s/he will serve over the next five years. The aim is to help voters understand the candidate’s vision and ideas regarding development efforts in the city. 

 The 2-minute videos will be displayed on the website a few days before polling day. The step will help voters know the candidates and their plans for local areas,   said.
 
 An official from the   said the civic body will be undertaking this initiative for the first time. The candidates will have to create their own videos and present a copy to the election officers. Our officers will scrutinise each video and check the content before publishing it on the website, an official said.
 
 The city has 41 panels from which voters will select 162 representatives. Each panel has four councillors, which means voters would cast four votes.
 
 AS Rahane, a resident of Vishrantwadi, said that PMC’s step sounds quite effective. “People hardly take out the time to understand a candidate’s vision. Many come to know the candidates’ names only after they reach the polling station. Uploading videos therefore looks like an effective step. It will be easy for voters to get information regarding every candidate in one click,” Rahane said.
