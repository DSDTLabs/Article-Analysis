HYDERABAD: The death of two labourers, after a mound of mud fell on them burying them alive, left their families and other workers fuming at the accident site in Kondapur on Monday. Distraught kin of the victims refused to allow authorities to move their bodies for nearly two hours. Other construction workers from the Masjid banda area too protested against authorities. 

 While the victims were being pulled out, friends and relatives shouted slogans against the   (GHMC) and the contractors of the under-construction building. Staging a dharna at the site, they demanded that the contractors announce ex-gratia immediately for the deceased's kin.
 
 While GHMC commissioner, mayor and deputy mayor reached the spot and announced 8 lakh relief for the deceased, the workers demanded ex-gratia be paid by either Vamsiram Builders or land owner P Mahipal Reddy. 
 
 One of the workers at the spot Venkataiah said, "These officials will make announcements and leave. Where will this small girl (pointing to a relative of the victim) run about for getting compensation? The contractor should be called here and he should announce a compensation." 
 
 Eighteen-year-old Lakshmi who was inconsolable after having lost her mother in the tragedy said, "My mother used to look after all of us. I have an eight-year-old younger brother. Who will take care of us now?" Her father Papaiah too was injured in the incident.
 
 After convincing the workers for over an hour, GHMC commissioner B Janardhan Reddy made a few calls and assured them that he would make sure that the contractors pay 10 lakh. "I have spoken to the contractor and will ensure that the sum is handed over to the victims," he said. 
 
 Only after getting the assurance did the workers allow the dead to be taken away. The bodies were taken to the Osmania   (OGH) for an autopsy to be carried out.
