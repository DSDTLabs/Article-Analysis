NEW DELHI:   have called the   to the   a   and resolved to take the   to the  .

 Rajiv Kakria, head of GK-I RWA and a member of the Save Our City campaign, said: “Some of our demands have been met. But the activities that have been allowed will only put additional burden on infrastructure. The fallout in terms of pollution and parking mess have not been tackled.” 
 
 A statement from the group that comprises representatives of RWAs, NGOs and activists read: “More needs to be done and efforts will be made to present the true picture to SC through its monitoring committee.” 
 
 Chetan Sharma, general secretary of the Confederation of NCR RWAs, said: “We are talking about the lives of millions of people. How can we deal with it in terms of a compromise and without a larger perspective? The aim of the entire exercise was to give relief to traders, no matter what the cost.”
 
 While basements could now be used for commercial purposes, “where is the additional parking space”, he asked. “The Delhi master plan is being played with horribly,” Sharma claimed.
 
 BS Vohra, who heads the East Delhi RWAs Joint Front, said an execution plan was missing. “The amendments talk about rationalisation of conversion charge, but where did tax income from 2006 onwards go? Pedestrianisation of streets will be done at places where there is no parking space, but what happened to streets declared pedestrian earlier? Additional electricity load will be allowed and the transformers capacity is still low; will it not lead to safety issues?” he asked. 
 
 While some of their demands, such as separate entry-exit for local shopping centres and closure of entries from residential side, have been accepted, the lack of clarity over execution has the RWAs worried.
