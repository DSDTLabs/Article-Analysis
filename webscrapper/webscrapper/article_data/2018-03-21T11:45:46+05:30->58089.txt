CHENNAI: The   has adjourned the hearing of an   plea to restrain   from using the party flag, claiming that it was deceptively similar to that of the AIADMK’s.

 Justice C V Karthikeyan adjourned the hearing to March 27, as counsel for Dhinakaran sought time to file a counter affidavit. Though the counter is ready Dhinakaran’s signature could not be obtained in view of his uncle Natarajan’s death, he said.
 
 The civil suit was moved by chief minister and AIADMK party joint coordinator  , who also wanted the court to order Rs 25 lakh as damages on Dhinakaran for exploiting the goodwill of the AIADMK.
 
 The two leaves symbol and flag are synonymous with members of the AIADMK for more than 45 years. The combination of colours (red, white and black) created a unique identity for AIADMK members and had been used by the party since 1972, the CM said.
