CHENNAI: All major political parties which contested in the R K Nagar byelection have understated their expenses to the tune of 6 lakhs to 8 lakhs. All candidates were to submit their expenditure statements to EC observer   before Wednesday evening. The EC observer told TOI that due to language barrier, the EC team could not monitor advertisements and so election expenses were understated by major candidates. 

 "We monitored meticulously the campaign of candidates and recorded the expenses incurred. Once the statement of expenditure was presented, we showed the EC calculation with proof. All the candidates accepted the shadow observation of EC," said Kumar. The EC has not included the money seized in the constituency before the bypoll. "Even after we seized the money meant for distribution and knew that it belonged to a particular candidate, we could not include it as part of any expense," he said. 
 
  candidate E   has maximum understated amount of 4.62 lakh followed by R K Nagar MLA T T V Dhinakaran (4.31 lakh). DMK's   has understated 1.43 lakh and  's   1.02 lakh. There are also cases of independent candidates spending more than shadow account of the  . Suresh Babu, an independent candidate, had spent 1.03 lakh but the EC accounts show that he had spent only 8,604. Four independents did not bother to submit the expenditure accounts even on the last day. The expenditure observer said during the campaign several showcause notices were issued to printing presses which printed notices of various candidates without proper details of owner and address.
