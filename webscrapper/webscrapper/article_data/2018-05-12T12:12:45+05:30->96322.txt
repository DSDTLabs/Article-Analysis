MUMBAI: To improve   on the  , the Western Railway (WR) rolled out a few coaches with   cameras on the Mumbai-Delhi route from Friday.

 The decision to install four CCTV   in five coaches of the Rajdhani Express was taken after a spate of thefts. The first such train left Mumbai Central for New Delhi on Friday. 
 
 “This will act as a deterrent and help us crack cases as we will now have video evidence in case of  ,” the WR chief PRO said.
 
 The installation was done on a quotation basis at a cost of Rs 10 lakh, said the chief PRO. The WR also invited tenders to install CCTVs in 100 coaches. There are five rakes of Rajdhani-class trains, including the Mumbai-New Delhi Rajdhani and the Mumbai-Nizamuddin August Kranti Rajdhani train.
 
 The project cost is Rs 2.5 crore and the tender is on the verge of finalisation. The WR plans six CCTVs in each   — two each on the entry-exit close to washrooms and two in the aisle leading to the berths. 
 
 “Work is expected to begin in June or July and all coaches will have CCTVs by the end of September,” the official said.
 
 The CCTV cameras are as specified by the Integral Coach Factory, Chennai, with facial recognition and high-resolution image, besides ability to deliver satisfactory results in low light, such as in the aisle, and “traction-worthy technology” to capture images even when the coach oscillates. 
 
 The internet-protocol-based system has internal storage and removable media, allowing data retrieval at intermediate stations. “We will not have live feeds but recording is good enough to deter and catch the accused in case of a crime,” the official said.
