PUNE:   Anna Hazare on Friday said he was deeply pained by the  , which indicted Delhi chief minister  , and said that Kejriwal has forgotten all principles in the  .

 Strongly condemning the Delhi chief minister for violating laws and the Constitution, Hazare said he will never support what Kejriwal has done and that he has dashed all his hopes. The Shunglu committee report indicted Kejriwal’s government for bypassing law, nepotism and financial irregularities, among others.
 
 “I am pained by the Shunglu committee report because Arvind was with me in the fight against corruption. I had great hopes from the young and educated Kejriwal and felt that young people like him will create a corruption-free nation. But he has dashed all my hopes,” said Hazare in a statement issued from Ralegan Siddhi.
 
 Hazare said he will never ever support the way the Delhi government broke all rules and laws and said such behaviour will weaken the country and society.
 
 “I am grateful to God that he made me stay away from Kejriwal when he floated his political party. I never had the desire to go and meet him after he became the chief minister,” the Gandhian said.
 
 Hazare said during the days when Kejriwal was with him, he always told him that a leader must maintain purity of thought and action, lead an unblemished life and make sacrifices for the betterment of the country and society. “But the Shunglu committee report shows that Kejriwal has forgotten everything in the pursuit of power,” he said.
