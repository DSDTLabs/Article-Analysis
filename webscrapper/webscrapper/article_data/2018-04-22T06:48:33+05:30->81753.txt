BENGALURU: A pulse astrologer, who claims to predict your future by holding your wrists for a few minutes, is in police custody for sexually harassing and cheating a woman learning the trade from him.

 Gangammanagudi police on Saturday arrested   alias  , 35, who even appears on a few vernacular television channels, based on a complaint by his 25-year-old student. He was booked under Sections 420 (cheating) and 354-A (sexually harassing a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 According to the woman, who began learning from him in mid-2015, Dinesh had taken Rs 50 lakh from her in early 2017. “My father had sold a portion of the land he owned near the city for Rs 50 lakh. I asked Dinesh if my father could start a new business and he showed interest in the proposal and asked how much my father could invest,” she told police.
 
 When she told Dinesh about the Rs 50 lakh, he convinced her that her father should invest the money with him. “He told me he would put my father’s money in a business and pay us monthly installments. Since he was my tutor, I trusted him and gave the money against my father’s wishes,” she told police.
 
 After receiving the money, Dinesh began to avoid the woman, and did not pay even one instalment as promised. She claims he even sexually harassed her some time in May 2017, but she had not complained to the police fearing disrepute.
