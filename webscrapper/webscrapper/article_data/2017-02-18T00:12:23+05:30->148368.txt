NEW DELHI: A 35-year-old man was mowed down on   on Tuesday. But this unfortunate incident turned into a   when the body was crushed by another vehicle — or a series of vehicles, going by certain allegations — and dragged along for a few metres. Police found a severely mutilated corpse. 

 Police said they received a call around 12.05am about the mutilated corpse lying near Kirbi Place crossing, and a team had reached the spot five minutes later. They ruled out the possibility of multiple vehicles running over the body as the man, going by the autopsy report, was   by a heavy vehicle and no heavy vehicle can enter the city before 11pm, and therefore, can’t reach that spot before 40 minutes. The report also suggests it was dragged along by the vehicle, which was probably a 16-wheel truck. 
 
 “We have not found any note or identity proof on the body,” said a senior officer, adding that the victim had black trousers and a white shirt on and may have been living in a nearby shack. DCP (southwest) Surender Kumar said efforts were on to identity the man.
