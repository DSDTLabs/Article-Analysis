The family of assistant inspector  , who went missing in 2016, has demanded that the case be heard in a fast-track court and lawyer Ujjwal Nikam be appointed as special public prosecutor.

 They have also demanded that assistant police commissioner Sangeeta Alphonso, who is supervising the investigation, be made the full-time investigating officer in the case. The family members are also firm on their demand that Navi Mumbai police commissioner Hemant   be made a co-accused.
 
 Addressing the media in   on Thursday, Ashwini’s husband  , said inspector   was arrested ten months after the case was registered in January 2017. “We want the case to be heard in a fast-track court. We also want the government to appoint Ujjwal Nikam as special public prosecutor,” he said. Nagrale did not respond to text messages or calls from TOI on Thursday, but earlier he had maintained that the investigation was progressing in the right direction.
 
 “There is no question of either me or any other officer casually handling the case as the missing person is a police official and the accused is an inspector. It is true that we could not trace the missing police official. We are waiting for the reports of DNA tests, which may throw more light on the case. The matter is sub-judice at this stage and it will not be appropriate to disclose much details of investigation,” he had said.
