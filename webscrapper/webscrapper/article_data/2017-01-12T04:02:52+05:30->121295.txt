MUMBAI: A special   (POCOSA) court on Tuesday rejected the anticipatory bail plea of a mother-son duo who had allegedly forced a 16-year-old girl into prostitution.

 “On perusing the statement of the victim given to the police and her statement under Section 164 of the CrPC (statement recorded before the magistrate), it is seen that she has made serious allegations against her mother and elder brother. The investigation is still in progress. In such circumstances, anticipatory bail cannot be granted to the applicants,” the court said while rejecting the plea.
 
 The girl claimed that after her father’s death, her   would assault and ill-treat her every time she refused to give into their demands and her brother would touch molest her. She further alleged that on March 7, 2015, her mother touched her inappropriately and even beat her and two days later, she left the house and sought refuge with a couple who were her mother’s former tenants. The couple then helped her register a compliant with the police.
 
 In their bail plea, the mother and son contended that they were falsely implicated in the case at the instance of the couple as a bid to seek revenge. The accused claimed that they had asked the couple to vacate the house as they suspected that the duo was not married.
 
 The defence submitted that the accused had assisted the police in the investigation during the interim protection that had been granted to them. Further, the defence said, as the accused were permanent residents of the city, there was no possibility of them absconding. The prosecution objected to the pleas. The special public prosecutor told the court that as the victim had no faith in her mother and brother and her father was dead, she took help of the couple. She submitted that considering the circumstances of the case the application may be rejected.
