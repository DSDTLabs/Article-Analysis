AHMEDABAD: A division bench of   on Tuesday asked assistant commissioner of police with the special branch,  , to proceed on leave and not to resume work till her appeal against the HC order for her removal is not finalized.

 The high court said the original records would be inspected, and issued notice to the state government, Gujarat Public Service Commission ( ) and the original petitioner who was a candidate for Class I & II posts, Neha Parmar. Further hearing of this case is now adjourned till June 20.
 
 Last week, the bench headed by the chief justice had stayed Munshi’s removal after a single-judge ordered so as she did not meet the physical criteria for the post of  .
 
 During the selection process in 2011, Munshi fell short of eligibility criteria in her   (deflated) and chest expansion. She was still appointed in the police department. This happened after Gujarat’s general administration department (GAD) did not follow procedure and referred her case to another medical board. The referral to the second medical board in Jamnagar was wrong. Though Munshi qualified in the height criterion she failed in chest measurement, GAD asked that her height be measured again and but was mum on re-measuring the chest.
