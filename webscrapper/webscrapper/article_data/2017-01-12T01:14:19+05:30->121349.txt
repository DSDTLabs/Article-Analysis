MUMBAI: Ten years after four youth were arrested for the gangrape and   of a three-and-a-half-year-old-girl in Govandi, the Bombay   on Tuesday acquitted them and ordered their release from prison. 

 “The case of the prosecution may be true but we are unable to record the finding that it must be true in all probability,” said a division bench of Justices   and Anant Badar. “We are of the considered opinion that the prosecution has failed to prove guilt of accused in respect of any offences alleged against them beyond all reasonable doubts. They are found to be entitled for benefit of doubt as incriminating circumstances against them are not firmly established by the prosecution,” added the judges, while striking down the trial court order sentencing them to life imprisonment. The judges said the evidence given by police in the case was “laconic and insufficient”.
 
 Police said the four had kidnapped the toddler on April 7, 2006, and gangraped and sodomised her, before strangling her to death and throwing her body in a septic tank. The motive for the crime, according to the police, was that the child’s father, who owned a medical shop in Trombay, had rejected their demand for providing them with some tablets. A sessions court had held Mohammed Shaikh, Asif Ansari,   and   guilty for the offences of kidnapping, committing unnatural offences and murder, and sentenced them to life imprisonment.
 
 While hearing their appeal, the HC said that the case against the four was based on circumstantial evidence. The court disbelieved the evidence of the witness, who had claimed that he had last seen the minor with the four. The HC also questioned the motive, as it was easier for the four to get the tablets from their neighbourhood in Govandi, instead of asking it from the girl’s father, whose medical shop was in Trombay. The HC said the polygraph, narco-analysis and brain-mapping test reports did not help the prosecution case.
