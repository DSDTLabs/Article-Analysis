BHOPAL: Six girls from the same government-run school in Sidhi district of Madhya Pradesh have committed suicide in a bizarrely identical fashion in less than three weeks, triggering alarm bells among parents and teachers and leaving police with a nightmarish puzzle to solve.

 They all studied in   and hanged themselves in their respective homes without leaving suicide notes. The school is 25km from the Sidhi district headquarters and about 750km from Bhopal. The girls were of varying ages, studied in different classes and lived in different villages.
 
 There was nothing in their behaviour to indicate they were depressed, say police officers who have spoken to the families. Parents of other students are now paranoid that the 'serial suicides' might affect the rest - a fear not unfounded, say cops.
 
 
 
 
 It's sort of a grisly trend that the same suicide method goes around, explained Ajay Kumar Maraskole, town inspector of  . "If someone hangs herself, the same method is seen in the next three-four suicides," Maraskole told TOI over phone.
 
 "These girls were from different villages but in the same school. We have not come across any significant reason behind these deaths," he added. The victims studied in Classes IX and XI. The last suicide was reported on March 9, when Rani Yadav, 14, was found hanging in Gajrahi village.
 
 On March 5, Akansha Shukla, 17, of Kothar killed herself similarly. Three days before that,  , 18, was found hanging in her house in Kubri. Class XI student Anita Sahu, 16, of Karodi village was found hanging in her house on February 27. Two other victims are from Duaragaon.
