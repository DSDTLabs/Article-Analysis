NAGPUR: The Itwari Grain and Seeds Merchants Association has welcomed the move to extend the ban on import of pulses to processed pulses also. The notification on extending the ban was issued a couple of days ago.

 “Earlier, the ban was applicable only to unprocessed pulses, like tur whole or moong,   and peas. The pulses are later processed into edible form, which is known as tur dal or chana dal. Now, the ban has been imposed on processed pulses like tur dal or chana dal also, which will help improve the market rates,” said  , secretary of the association. 
 
 The move will help hike the rates, which will ultimately help farmers. At present, rates of all pulses were reigning below the minimum support price (MSP). Tur whole (unprocessed form) is being sold at Rs4,150 to 4,250 a quintal as against a   of Rs5,400 per quintal. Chana is fetching Rs3,600 a quintal and the MSP stands at Rs4,400, said Motwani.
 
 The rates have firmed up by around Rs200 in all the pulses after the order. The government needs to ban futures trading in chana to further help firm up the rates, he said.
