Trichy: The body of S Krishnasamy, 47, who died in Ernakulam in Kerala on Sunday, where he was accompanying his son to appear for the national eligibility-cum-entrance test (NEET), was cremated at his hometown Vilakkudi in Tiruvarur on Tuesday. 

 As reported, the CBSE had come under criticism for allotting centres outside the state for students from Tamil Nadu forcing many of them and their parents to face hardships. Ill health as well as the tedious travel to Ernakulam was said to be the reasons for the death of S Krishnsamy. 
 
 Leaders of various parties who offered condolences to the relatives of Krishnasamy accused the CBSE and Union government of being responsible for his death. They also took the state government to task for allegedly not doing anything to ensure that the students wrote NEET within the state. While the state government announced Rs 3 lakh compensation to the family members of Krishnasamy, it also took responsibility of the higher studies of his son Kasthuri Mahalingam.
 
 Krishnasamyâ€™s body was brought to his home in Tiruvarur in the early hours of Monday and political leaders offered their condolences throughout the day. The body was kept for the arrival of one of his relatives from the Middle East after which the last rites were performed on Tuesday morning.
