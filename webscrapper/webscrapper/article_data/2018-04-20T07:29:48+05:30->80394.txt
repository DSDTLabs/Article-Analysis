MANGALURU:  's election war room for   district is up and running. 

 Favouring its 'election talisman' in a property owned by   party supporter B R   near Bunts Hostel, the saffron party on Thursday got its campaign to bag all eight assembly constituencies in the district underway with blessings of seniors - Rukmayya Poojary, Kumble Sundar Rao, former MLAs, and Seetharam Bangera and Somanath, senior workers, who lit the lamp.
 
 Detailing the history that the property has played in party's electoral success in the district since 2004, Dakshina Kannada MP   Kumar Kateel said BJP won two parliamentary constituencies - DK and   and seven out of eight assembly constituencies when the general and assembly elections were held simultaneously that year. BJP tasted success in 2008 assembly polls winning four of eight assembly seats in DK in 2008, also due to this office, he said.
 
 The parliamentary election held in 2009 saw BJP win DK and Udupi LS seats with Nalin winning for the first time from DK and D V Sadananda Gowda winning from Udupi. The result was also sweet for Nalin who won with a record margin in 2014 LS polls, with party operating from the same office. The only time that BJP did not use this office was in 2013 assembly polls and the results that year saw   win seven out of eight assembly seats in Dakshina Kannada.
 
 Averring that setting up party's election war room in this same property will bring in good augury for BJP in these polls, Nalin said there is a definite wave in favour of the party that will see it win all eight assembly constituencies, come May 15. The cadre-based party that has already begun the ground work in all constituencies having finished one round of door-to-door campaign has seen encouraging signals from the ground which will translate in win for the party, he said.
