Mumbai: The assembly on Saturday passed a   amending   to increase the prison term to five years for those found guilty of hurting or   —officials and elected representatives— discharging duty. 

 The prison term for those found guilty of “hurting” a public servant performing his duty under the   has been increased to five years from 3 years. The prison term for those found guilty of “assaulting” a public servant to deter him from performing job has been increased to five years from two years under the Code of Criminal Procedure.
 
 Chief Minister   said stricter punishment was required since the number of such cases was on the rise. The state recorded 17,682 such cases between 2011 and 2016, he said. BJP MLA Ashish Shelar had criticised the bill saying there are enough safeguards for officials and they will use the new law against citizens who come to them for work. 
 
 Several MLAs, including Shiv Sena’s Jaiprakash Mundada, had asked for more time to debate the bill. “This may create the impression that the government is trying to shield officials. Also, we need to consider why the public wants to assault officials. It is often because they feel their work is not being done,” said Mundada.
 
 However, Fadnavis said the main offenders were not members of the public but contractors. “In many cases, the offenders were those involved in sand mining. We are not trying to shield officials and public representatives but the right people should get protection,” he said.
