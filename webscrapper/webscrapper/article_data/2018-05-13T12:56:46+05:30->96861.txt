TRICHY: A special police team has arrested four people, including an employee, in connection with the robbery at the   (TMB) branch at Sesham in  , Tiruvarur district on May 7. Two cars, a gun and a fake gun apart from Rs 2.58 lakh in cash were recovered from the four, police said.

 The six-member special team was formed to probe the incident in which a five-member gang robbed the bank of Rs 5.58 lakh in cash and 84 grams of gold jewellery. Briefing reporters, the inspector general of police for central zone,  , said they had arrested Maria Selvam, 35, of Thoothukudi who was the mastermind of the theft, car driver Muthukumar, 27, Meeran Mohideen, 29, and Sudalai Mani, 26, in connection with the incident.
 
 Maria Selvam was working an assistant at the TMB Manapparai branch in Trichy and had attempted to rob the Sesham branch on May 5. He had arrived at Mannargudi a day before with his accomplice for the purpose. As they were unable to execute their plan, they recced the premises twice on the morning of May 7. They succeeded in their next attempt as all the employees, except bank manager Govindarajan, cashier   and a courier boy were away for lunch.
 
 The robbers locked all the three in a room after snatching a locker key and fled the scene with the cash and gold ornaments. Maria Selvam had planned to rob the Manapparai branch itself where he worked, but changed his mind. A search was on for two more accomplices, Varatharaju further said. He praised some residents of Sesham who helped the police by handing over footages recorded on the CCTV fixed at their houses. The IG appealed to all traders and the general public to fix more CCTV cameras at vantage areas. While escaping from the bank after the robbery, the gang had carried the digital video recorder (DVR) connected to CCTV cameras in the bank with them.
