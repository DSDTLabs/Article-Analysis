HYDERABAD: City traffic cops catch, on an average, 25 underage drivers every month who are found driving without licence. Even more shocking is a traffic police that states in 2017 over 130 road accident victims in Hyderabad were minors.

 “Most underage drivers we catch are in the age group of 14 to 17 years. Traffic police provides them counselling along with their parents. Despite that cases of underage driving are rampant in the city,” said a traffic police officer.
 
  
 
 
 Experts said, for the safety of children, parents need to be booked to curb the menace of underage driving. “Parents who allow their underage kids to drive are putting their lives at risk. At the age of 14-18, a child is not mature enough to handle a heavy vehicle. But still this practice is rampant in the city and I have never heard about parents being booked. Only if parents start getting booked because of the offence, the menace can be curbed,” said  , founder of Indian Federation of Road Safety and traffic expert.
 
 He also added that cases were rampant in  , where minors can be seen driving heavy vehicles. “There are many such cases that go unreported, as parents fail to report ‘small, non-fatal accidents,” added the expert.
 
 “When a vehicle is given to a minor, it becomes a sense of independence for him/her. At the age of 14 to 18, children are not mature enough to drive. They drive according to their mood swings. For some it might be just to look cool, while others may be depressed or angry and so speed up as a result. So, minors are more vulnerable to accidents than a mature adult,” said Dr  , psychiatrist and director of Amrita Foundation.
