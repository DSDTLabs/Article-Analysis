NEW DELHI: The Delhi Commission for Women has summoned social welfare secretary Dilraj Kaur in connection with the   case. Earlier, it had issued a notice, seeking her response within 72 hours on the matter pertaining to death of inmates and the abysmal condition at the facility for the mentally challenged. 

 The commission took “strong note of the fact that despite the passage of stipulated time, information sought has not been provided. The unexplained and unnecessary delay caused in the matter is likely to prejudice the said case”, the notice said.
 
 With the department sending no response by Wednesday,   issued a   to its secretary, directing her to appear before the commission on February 11. “Considering the extreme gravity and critical nature of the issues, which concern the life and liberty of the residents of the   Home, you are hereby summoned to appear before the commission for the purpose aforementioned on February 11, 2017 at 11am.
 
 The DCW wants the secretary, social welfare, to explain the unreasonable cause of delay in furnishing the above information,” the commission said. “If you fail to comply with this order without lawful excuse, you will be subjected to the consequences of non-attendance as provided in law,” it added.
 
 Earlier on Monday evening, chief secretary M M Kutty submitted a preliminary report in the case to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. The CM had expressed his displeasure against the secretary of the social welfare department that runs the shelter, and sought to know the reason behind her silence on the deaths, that reportedly took place over the past two months.
 
 During her visit to the facility, DCW chief Swati Maliwal found it extremely crowded and badly managed. Toilets were extremely unhygienic and there was an acute shortage of staff at the complex.
