 More importantly, said an official spokesman, the state cabinet has exempted women from any stamp duty in case the property is registered in their names. The cabinet approved levy of stamp duty of 5 per cent in urban areas and 3 per cent in rural areas if a property is registered in the name of a male member of a family, the official spokesman said.
