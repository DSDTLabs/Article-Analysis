HYDERABAD: Syed Zaker Raheem, who is wanted in a case of alleged conspiracy to kill rightwing leaders in the city, and his associates organised meetings of controversial Islamic preacher   during his visits to   for benefit of  , intelligence officials said. This comes a day after Raheem was brought to city from Saudi due to permanent exit given by security agencies.
During one such meeting, Raheem and his associates even took photographs with the televangelist, officials said. Raheem, the brother-in-law of Farhatullah Ghori who is wanted in several terror cases and holed up in  , was carrying out activities in promoting the ideology of Islamic State. For such activities, Raheem was under detention by Saudi Arabia authorities since May 2016. In fact, Raheem was not deported, he was actually given permanent exit from Saudi along with his wife and three kids.
 
 Raheem and another   were wor king closely in Saudi Arabia at the behest of Ghori in motivating like-minded persons towards terror activities besides furtherance of their conspiracies. “These two Hyderabadis used to informally organise Darsga and call preachers to motivate and, if possible, recruit persons for clandestine terror activities. We came to know that on one or two occasions, Naik was invited and he gave his discourse at Salam's residence. Raheem admitted meeting Zakir Naik and taking photographs, but denied organising the mee tings. We have our doubts that Raheem or Salam would have organised it,“ source said.
 
 Raheem claimed he was not in touch with Ghori as they both developed differences after Raheem's 2002 India visit. “Ghori from Pakistan used to visit Saudi Arabia occasionally from a very long time to see Raheem and others,“ the officials said.
 
 Raheem was produced before a magistrate on Friday night and he was sent to judicial remand on Saturday . Raheem has been working in an insurance company in Saudi.
