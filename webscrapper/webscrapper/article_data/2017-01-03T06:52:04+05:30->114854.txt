VADODARA: A students group of MS University’s Faculty of Science on Monday submitted memorandum to faculty dean alleging that the   was illegally charging entry fees ahead of the faculty’s youth festival. Supporters of the   argued that all the students already pay Rs 25 under the head of faculty/college student association fee while taking admission in the faculty. 

 “If you take into account 4,500 students, the total fees under this head comes to nearly Rs 1.12 lakh. These funds are to be utilised for organising youth fest. But the faculty association is still charging separate fee ranging from Rs 30 to Rs 50 per entry form from each student,” said a student leader associated with the group, adding, “Also, there are no receipts which are given to the students.” The group demanded that   be not more than Rs 10 and receipts should be issued to all students.
