LUCKNOW: A two-member team of World Wildlife Fund ( ) visited   on Tuesday to verify whether dogs are attacking and killing children or any other wild animal is involved. The administration has also roped in an animal behaviour expert. 

 Accompanied by forest officials, the WWF team visited three spots where children were mauled to death by dogs. District forest officer Anirudh Pandey said that the team took global positioning system location of Gurpaliya, Ferozpur and Karbala, spoke to eye-witnesses and recorded their statements. 
 
 "Samples like pug-marks of animals, blood stains were collected and other details were noted down," said Pandey. Pandey said that the pug-marks will be sent to lab for further examination. TOI tried reaching WWF officials in New Delhi but the calls went unanswered. The administration has also roped in animal behaviour expert Wasif Jamshed who was instrumental in eradicating man-tiger conflict in Pilibhit in 2016.
 
 Jamshed said , "Prima facie it seems dogs were behind attacks. These dogs have become predatory and very aggressive. There is only one group which is attacking children." "Wolves and hyenas never attack in daytime, eat whole body and never leave it uneaten. They attack people of all ages, not just children," he claimed. 
 
 Meanwhile, the police started using drones to keep an eye on the area. Sitapur DM Sheetal Verma said that WWF officials will submit their report after inspection while experts from   have also been asked to assist.
