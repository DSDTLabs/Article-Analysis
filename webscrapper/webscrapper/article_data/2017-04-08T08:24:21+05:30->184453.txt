Six accused, including three minors, will be produced before the court on Saturday as they were arrested by Friday late evening," said the police.
  
 Anandhu, a student of Rama Varma Higher Secondary School at Vayalar, was allegedly attacked by a 17-member gang while he was returning home. The gang was not armed, police said.
  
 “Head injuries resulted in his death,” said V P Mohanlal said.
 
 “Local residents rushed him to the Government Hospital here, but he had already died.” Police were suspecting that Anandu, son of Pattanakkad-resident Ashokan, was in a relationship with a girl, who was the love interest of another teen. 
 
 “This (love affair) could be the motive. They did not intend to murder him,” the officer said while ruling out political rivalry could have led to the incident. 
 
 Political parties, however, refused to believe the police version. CPM leaders alleged that Anandu was an RSS activist, but had been, of late, keeping a distance from the activities of that organization, which ended in his murder.
 
 The hartal called by the LDF and the UDF in the district was total and peaceful. Local KSRTC and private buses did not conduct any services. Shops and offices partially closed, but nobody disrupted the functioning of office and shops.
