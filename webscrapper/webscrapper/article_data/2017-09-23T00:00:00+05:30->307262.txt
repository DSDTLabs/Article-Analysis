It’s 2 am. Rishi Shah’s phone lights up with a beep, rousing him from sleep. He checks and there’s a Whatsapp message from Gaurav to the office group informing everyone that he won’t be able to come in tomorrow (rather today) because of some family emergency. Nowadays, when everyone is part of some WhatsApp group — be it family, building, block or school — it was only a matter of time when workplace   became par for course. Exchanging ideas, tendering leaves and delegating work is kosher on this instant messaging app. But what is not cool? “2 am messages,” remarks etiquette trainer and CEO of an executive training firm, Swapnil Kamat. Kamat has seen a rise in use of WhatsApp at the workplace. “Traditionally, using an informal platform like this as a means of workplace communication is frowned upon, but it is actually a time-saver and the quickest means of disseminating information or getting people to take action,” he says. But there are certain rules to deploying it. First, it is a work group and treat it as such. His advice: Team leads/managers should ensure that unless absolutely necessary and urgent, work should not be allotted to teams over it.

 
 
 While employees are making Whatsapp groups informally for efficient workflow and team building, some companies have introduced office policies on WhatsApp and its scope at the workplace. Companies fear losing sensitive data because of loopholes in the app. That’s why HR professionals advice against exchanging official data over the medium. That’s why most Whatsapp groups are unofficial. The good news? The fact that it’s not official gives you a ‘get out of jail free’ card for not joining it. It’s your discretion how you respond, whether you keep the ‘blue tick’ on or keep it silent.
 
 
 
 Even if it’s unofficial, be careful about what you post. Ideally, WhatsApp groups for work should be restricted to work-related conversations. So avoid jokes, God photos, chain forwards. Depending on the rapport you share with everyone in the group and the general work culture, it is okay to sometimes share a good joke. But what’s not allowed? Gossip. According to etiquette experts, it is okay to exit an office WhatsApp group, especially where you do not have inputs to provide. But it’s best to exit with grace: that is write a message and then exit stating the reasons for it.
 
 
 
 Nope. Respond only if it’s some information or response that is needed urgently by the boss and which can have an effect on his/her work.
 
 
 
 Yes. Especially where you do not have inputs to provide and nor is the information exchanged of any use to you. If you have to leave, exit with grace – message and then exit.
 
 
 
 -Avoid sending messages from 11 pm to 7 am
 -Don’t overdo sending images or videos – work related or otherwise
 -Stop sending greetings, especially those annoying ‘Good Morning’ messages and religious forwards
 -Avoid those pass on messages and definitely don’t forward any WhatsApp health messages
 -Don’t add people to a group unnecessarily and without informing them
