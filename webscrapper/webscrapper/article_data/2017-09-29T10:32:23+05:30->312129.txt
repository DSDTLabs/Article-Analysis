MUMBAI: The   (BCCI) has revamped its grounds and pitches committee recently. Two senior curators,   (West) and PR Vishwanathan (South) have been 'relieved' of their duties, with   (Parsana's assistant at Motera, and previously a co-opted curator from  ) and S Sriram of Karnataka (South) being their replacements. Incidentally, the man who informed them that the Board won't renew their contracts was former   general manager (operations) MV Sridhar, who quit on Wednesday.

 Daljeet Singh (North), continues to head the panel, with Tapas Chattejree (Central) and Ashish Bhowmik also still there. Mumbai's Ramesh Mamunkar is the co-opted member in the committee now from the West Zone, while Chandrashekhar of Hyderabad is the man promoted from the South Zone.
 
 “I think Vishwanathan quit because of personal reasons. He had a knee operation 4-5 months back and he himself requested the Board to discontinue his services. Both he and Parsana have contributed handsomely to the growth of the committee and served it well. Vishwanathan was good technically, and Parsana practically. There's no malice, or controversy behind this decision. The Board just wanted to introduce some young blood in this field. All the qualified, certified curators, who've served for the last five-seven years in the Board have been promoted,” Singh told TOI on Thursday .
 
 For the 69-year-old Parsana, this was the end of a long innings. A former first class cricketer, he made his debut for Saurashtra back in 1965, and then played for Gujarat and Railways too.
