HYDERABAD: He has accompanied and stood by his father at every step. However, when it comes to matters of religious faith, the son prefers to stay away. This is because he is a non-believer.And that is why   IT and municipal administration minister   was conspicuous by his absence when his god-fearing father and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao undertook a pilgrimage to Tirumala on Wednesday and fulfilled his promise of offering gold ornaments to Lord Venkateshwara for having been swept to power in 2014.

But as an individual, I have my beliefs“.
