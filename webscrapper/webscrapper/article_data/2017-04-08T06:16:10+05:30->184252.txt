NAGPUR: Even though its question papers have been viral on social media for last three days, the mandatory cumulative evaluation (CE)   were held across the state in schools on April 6 and 7. The CE is held for Language and Math subject and is compulsory for students from all boards studying in Std I-VIII. Academicians say these   are not serving the intended purpose and should be scrapped. 

 A principal, who is also family member of her school’s trustees said, “These tests have to be implemented in the right spirit else its meaningless. The question papers are coming without any packing or security measures. The government wants to assess performance of the entire state but the data we now get will be fudged.” Nago Ganar, MLC from teachers constituency has already called for strict action against officials whose negligence led to the paper being leaked. Speaking to TOI earlier this week Ganar said, “I will demand suspension of such people who take things for granted.” 
 
 Another issue with these exams is that almost every school is making up their own timetable. The   had set April 6 and 7 for the Language and Math test to be conducted, but some schools in city held both exams on the same day. Trustee of one such school said, “It was a logistical problem because we got the question papers and instruction booklet at almost 9AM, which had to be collected from another school. Now to bring those question papers back to our campus, distribute it to over thousand students, read the instructions to ensure that no goof ups happen, will take at least 45 minutes. Apart from the written test even an oral exam has to be conducted which will take time and as per the government’s order schools have to be off by 12 noon because of heatwave.”
