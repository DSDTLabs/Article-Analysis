NEW DELHI:  , India's flagship carrier, may get a sepcial mention in  . 

 The Economic Survey released two days ago suggested that the government would do well to complete Air India's disinvestment in the next financial year. 
 
 The agenda for 2018-19, as suggested by the Survey, includes stabilising GST, completing the TBS (twin balance sheet) actions, privatising Air India, and staving off threats to macro-economic stability. 
 
 In June last year, the government had given in-principle nod for strategic disinvestment of Air India. The carrier, which has a debt burden of more than Rs 50,000 crore, managed to clock operational profit for the first time in a decade in 2015-16. 
 
 A foreign player has already expressed interest in acquiring 49% of soon-to-be-privatised Air India. Aviation secretary R N Choubey told TOI this company has given an "unsolicited expression of interest for AI's airline arm."
 
 The government had realised Rs 46,247 crore in 2016-17 from 16 transactions of disinvestment. 
 
 The Budget target for current fiscal was set at Rs 72,500 crore, which included Rs 46,500 crore to be raised through minority stake sale in PSUs, Rs 15,000 crore from strategic stake sale and Rs 11,000 crore from listing of general insurance companies.
