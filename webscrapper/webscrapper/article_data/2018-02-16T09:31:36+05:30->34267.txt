NEW DELHI: The benchmark equity indices kept burgeoning on Friday morning even as bank stocks stayed under pressure on back of   fraud.

 30-share BSE   gained 113.77 points to open on 34,411.24 and the broader 50-share NSE   went up by 26.85 points to start trading on 10,537.90. In initial trading, the indices were holding on to the early gains
 
 The PNB stock was down a further 2.5 per cent on Friday morning, dragging the overall PSU bank sub-index more than a per cent below previous closing mark. Stung by a massive Rs 11,400 crore fraud, state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) has lost over Rs 8,000 crore of market valuation in the last two sessions -- an amount equivalent to over six-times its full-year profit.
 
 All other sectoral sub-indices however, were trading firmly in the green led by IT and metal stocks. Hindalco, Ambuja Cement,   and   were gaining the most on Friday morning.
