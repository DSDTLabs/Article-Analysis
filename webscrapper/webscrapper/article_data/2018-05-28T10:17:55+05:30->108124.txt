CHANDIGARH: Each government house of the city having an area of 1 kanal and above will have to shell out Rs 250 per month for 1 kilowatt   plant.   governor and UT administrator V P   has approved the rate.

 The administration has decided to install at least two kilowatts solar power plant in each government house, so that it could be viable for residents to generate power.
 
 Senior bureaucrats, judges, ministers, doctors and other senior rank officers of Punjab, Haryana and Central government are residing in these houses in the city. Around 350 to 400 government houses are located in 11 sectors of the city and all have ample space on their rooftops to install solar panels. All houses have an area of 1 to 6.5 kanals.
 
 According to renewable energy department, two kilowatts solar panel would generate between 200 to 250 units of power on a monthly basis. As per initial estimates, this will reduce the power bill by Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,200. “The charges were approved by the administrator recently. The file is being processed by the   of the administration to decide the mode of payment and other aspects. Once the mode has been decided, the notification or order will be issued,” said an official of the UT administration.
 
 The administration has already initiated the process in this regard. The department advertised a tender a couple of weeks back, but none of the parties participated. The UT has again re-advertised the tender after making some changes in the rates and given 21 days’ time for interested parties to participate.
 
 The administration has planned make all government houses having an area of 1 kanal and above a solar energy-friendly house.
