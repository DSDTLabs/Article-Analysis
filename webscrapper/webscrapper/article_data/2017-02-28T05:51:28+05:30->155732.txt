NAVI MUMBAI: When   was appearing for her prelims late last year, she couldn’t sleep or eat properly and her parents didn’t know where to go for help. 

 The situation improved after a neighbour told Nikita to call a helpline, where all her fears could be addressed. “After talking to a counsellor, I was more relaxed and started sleeping and eating better,” she said.
 
 Most of the helplines are at their busiest before the examinations—from stressed students to worried parents, they are inundated with callers seeking help and solace. In today’s competitive environment, students often burn out even before examinations but with   just a phone call away, they now fare better.
 
 The boards have their own helplines to guide students not just about the stress of the examinations but also about centres and exam time tables. Students can access the helpline every day from 8 am to 7 pm. “We get around 100 calls a day just before the exams from  . We have trained counsellors who try to ease the  ,” said Murlidhar More, a counsellor.
 
 Johnson Thomas, founder of Aasra Centre, said that they attend to around 60 to 70 calls a day during this time. “Otherwise, we get around 30 calls a day,” he added.
 
 Most professional counsellors do attend to students but they are averse to discussing their problems on the phone. Anamika Gupta, who counsels students at schools, said that competitiveness has resulted in students getting nervous about exams. 
 
 “Expectations are high and with so much peer and parental pressure, students feel harassed,” she said. Often schools organize counselling sessions for students prior to the boards and this helps them tremendously, she added.
