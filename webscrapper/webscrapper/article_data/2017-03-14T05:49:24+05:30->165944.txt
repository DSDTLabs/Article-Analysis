PANAJI: Left red-faced after BJP stole its thunder post the   result to form the government, Congress is now struggling to keep its fold intact. Frustrated with the party’s indicisive central leadership in forming the government, a few party MLAs are vocal about their sentiments. 

 Frantic discussions and intervention from Congress members appears to have helped prevent further damage to the party’s strength. The leadership told the angry members that the party has moved the   challenging the decision of the governor to invite   to form the government and for not inviting the single largest party to do so.
 
 Party president Luizinho Faleiro and AICC general secretary   accepted that a few MLAs had threatened to quit in frustration but had reconsidered their decision.
 
 Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane blamed the mismangement by the party leadership in allowing the golden opportunity slip from their hands. 
 
 “We are completely disillusioned by what has happened. The people of Goa voted against BJP and gave mandate to Congress, but the failure to cobble up a government has let down the aspirations of the people,” Rane said.
