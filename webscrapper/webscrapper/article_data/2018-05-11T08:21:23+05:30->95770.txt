 MUMBAI: After more than a decade of sharp fall in the number of bird species, the   has this year seen a 100% rise compared to 2017.

 
 During a one-day annual count by the range forest office last month, 36 species of birds were spotted, which is double of 18 species found in 2017. However, this a far cry from 140 species of resident and 37 species of migratory birds found a little over a decade ago. Some of the new species spotted on April 30 include Emerald dove, yellowfooted green pigeon, shikra, white-rumped shama, leafbird, blue-capped rock thrush, rufous treepie and goldenbacked woodpecker.
 
  
  
 
 On the downside, forest officials spotted only five species of animals, down from nine in 2017, in the 12.1 sq km sanctuary. Recently, the forest officials have urged MSEDCL to realign all high voltage power transmission lines within the forest through a safe underground passage, since it is injuring and killing wildlife.
 
 Karnala range forest officer   said, "The number of species is counted annually at four waterholes at Kalhe, Apta,   and Akulwadi. The numbers and type of species were counted by a 15-member team for 24 hours. Though it was a cloudy day, a rise in the number of species was recorded. But the number may rise or dip next year due to a variety of factors.”
 
 Karnala sanctuary bird watcher   said, “The forest office has developed water holes and lakes leading to sighting of more number of animals and birds. However, the sanctuary also sees migratory birds. This leads to sharp difference in sighting of rare species in two successive counts."
 
 Explaining the measures being taken to improve the sanctuary,   said, "A four hectare land is maintained as a meadow. The unwanted shrubs are being removed. We are also planning to plant around 200 fruit-bearing plants before the rain."
