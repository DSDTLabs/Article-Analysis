  Dawn Williams, general manager, Blue Cross, welcomed the corporation's decision. "However, unless the cattle owners are brought to book by city police under Section 289 of the IPC (negligent conduct with respect to animal), instances of cattle running loose on streets will continue to happen," Williams added.
 
 Corporation officials said they do not receive protection from city police during cattle raids. "When our workers impound cows, they are attacked by owners. This is prominent in zones like Manali, Teynampet, Adyar and Sholinganallur," an official said. City police sources told TOI that they seldom receive requests from corporation before a raid.
