This film, which also stars Pratap Narayan, Praveen Pugalia, Sonu Gowda and  , is a light-hearted travel film that has been shot across  . “This is a feel-good film along the lines of Dil Chahta Hai. This is a film about a bunch of people and their emotions. The title is Onthara Bannagalu, because emotions are compared to colours in this film and there are different shades of various colours in each character. The film is about three friends — Jai, Sri and Ram — who have grown up together. They decide to take off on a quick getaway to escape some sort of pressure from work. The film explores what happens in the day when the characters lose their emotional baggages and face their insecurities. All of this, though, has been shown in a light manner,” says Kiran.
The actor also says that he’d suggested to the makers that the five protagonists should travel in the same car through their filming process to get to know each other. “This film is about people who are good friends and know each other well. To ensure that we get such chemistry onscreen, we used to travel together, and this helped us get to know each other and helped us connect on a personal level. We had a lot of fun through this filming process and are hoping that it translates onscreen,” says Kiran, who says the film has been shot in Mangaluru, Sakleshpur and  , among other areas in Karnataka.
