If only passenger feedback is taken into account, then the cleanliness ratings of stations across Southern Railway will go from bad to worse.

  (5) is the only station that figures among the top five clean stations in the Southern Railway zone. Stations in zonal headquarters Chennai do not feature in the top 20 within the zone. Madurai, ranked among the top 10 in the all-India level last year, has fallen to 286. Southern Railway is headquartered in Chennai and has divisions in Chennai, Salem, Madurai and Trichy. The three big stations -Chennai-Central,   and   -were placed 184, 288 and 298 in the list. Trichy is ranked 13 in the zone and has an overall rank of 137. However, if only the citizen feedback is taken into account, its ranking drops to 208, Madurai's goes down to 370, Tambaram's to 340, Chennai  's to 322 and Egmore's to 346.
 
 “This means that passengers actually think that these stations are dirtier than the overall survey results show,“ said a senior railway official.
 
 These rankings are despite the presence of senior officials near the stations, and they being asked to adopt facilities and monitor them on a regular basis. “Railways should bring out some rules where officers and their families should travel only by trains. This is the only way staff on the ground can be pushed into doing work, “ said S Satish a commuter on the ChennaiTrichy route.
 
 The survey results show that no station from Tamil Nadu is in the top 10 `most improved stations' list.   station was ranked all-India five last year. But this year it has dropped to 40.
