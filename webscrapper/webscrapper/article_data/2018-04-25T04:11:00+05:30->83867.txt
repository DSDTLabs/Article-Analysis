Vadodara: Students of M S University have been once again forced to do with goofed up hall tickets in middle of their exam season. 

 In the latest round, goofed up hall tickets have surfaced at two other big faculties including the Faculty of Commerce and the Faculty of Arts. 
 
 Around 40 students of Faculty of Commerce have received hall tickets which do not have their photographs – which is otherwise used to ascertain identity of a candidate appearing for the exams. 
 
 A couple of students of Faculty of Arts on the other hand have received hall tickets which do not mention the name of the subjects they are supposed to appear correctly. For instance, hall ticket of a student who is supposed to appear in Sindhi subject mentions the name of the subject as Sanskrit. 
 
 Just a couple of days back, a controversy had surfaced at Faculty of Science, after second semester students of first-year BSc had received hall tickets which incorrectly mentioned subjects they were supposed to appear in the exams. 
 
 This had also led to a war of words between the dean of Faculty of Science and the examination section. While the university’s exam section had attempted to put blame on the faculty stating that the subject selection is done by faculty level admission committee, the faculty officials had demanded that the exam section address loopholes in the system.
