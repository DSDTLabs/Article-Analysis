 Meanwhile, the owner of the laundry,  , tried his best to console the grieving customers. Husain said, “Wednesday happens to be an off day for us. We will open on Thursday and estimate the exact number of missing garments. Then we will compensate the customers for their loss.

We could also pay more if a customer can produce the original receipt of the garment and prove it was new,“ he said.
