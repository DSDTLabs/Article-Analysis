HYDERABAD: They call him 'Bond'. The 007 of Telangana. K T Rama Rao, that is. 

 For the bond that he shares with his 373K followers on Twitter, the Telangana IT minister gave a glimpse of a different shade of himself.
 
 The 40-year-old industries, IT, municipal administration and   affairs minister shared a picture of himself wearing dark shades, made light-hearted remarks and let down his guard playing ball with those who reacted to it.
 
 KTR, it was learnt, was on his way to the US for a family holiday. He did not reveal this to   and hardly anyone suspected this.
 
 If the workaholic son of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, a self-confessed   and Hobbes fan, gave much room for banter, it was because he was ostensibly in a perfect holiday mood. He was on cloud nine but felt he had to be in touch with the ground. And so he tweeted, "The Bourne series has to be one of the best made movie thriller series. Always a pleasure watching even the repeats on TV. My kinda genre."
 
 And so a curious   asked him, "Sir, have you ever tried to become a spy/secret-agent? The reply from  : "May be I am one how would you know?"
 
 "But you aren't wearing dark shades sir," one asked. KTR whipped out a pic of him wearing shades and shared it asking: "You mean like this?"
 
 KTR had lived in the US for eight years before he joined his father, K Chandrasekhar Rao, in the movement for a separate Telangana state. 
 
 After the goal was achieved and TRS won even the 2014 assembly polls, KTR was inducted into the ministry. His quick-wit and humour on Wednesday night, prompted someone to remark, "Sense of humor too and intelligence, deadly combo."
 
 The best reaction perhaps came from Madan Mohan who suspected that KTR's account would have been hacked, with ransomware being responsible. "Sir account evaraina hack chesara.. full masti mood lo unnaru.. ransomware (Has anyone hacked your account? Is it ransomware? You are in great mood," he said.
