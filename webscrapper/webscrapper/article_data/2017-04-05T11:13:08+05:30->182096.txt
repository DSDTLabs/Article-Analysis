AHMEDABAD: A host of business investments in Gujarat and a number of events organized may have increased occupancy in Ahmedabad hotels, but the average hotel tariffs here declined last year. While occupancy grew 5.3 percentage points to 60%, the average daily rate (ADR) dipped by 6.2% to Rs 3,751 in 2016, says the   2016 report by property consultant JLL. Ahmedabad is the only city where the ADR went down.

 Hoteliers and industry stakeholders claim that the decline is largely due to competitive pricing. “There is unexpected competitiveness in Ahmedabad, due to which hotels are dropping rates and at times, even going below the brand parity rate. As a result, revenue per available room (RevPAR) for each of the hotels goes down,” said Sanjay Kaushik, general manager,  , Ahmedabad.
 
 “The year 2015 was a record year for the market with a 55% year-on-year growth on the back of the Vibrant Gujarat Summit (VGS) and other key conferences exhibitions at Mahatma Mandir and other events such as the IPL. The year 2016 was dry compared to 2015 with regard to the number of events, and thus the hotel market witnessed a decline in average rate fearing lack of demand,” said Mandeep Lamba, managing director - hotels,  .
 
 In the last decade, several hotel chains have established their footprint in the city. This has led to a significant rise in the total inventory in the city. “The inventory of branded as well as non-branded hotels in Ahmedabad is huge in comparison with demand. While occupancy has gone up due to a host of events, it is again on a seasonal basis. In the race for increasing occupancy, the overall ADR goes down,” said Narendra Somani, president, Hotels and Restaurants Association, Gujarat.
