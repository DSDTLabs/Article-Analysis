PANAJI: All applications to open new English medium primary   from the academic year 2018-19 have been rejected by the directorate of education (DoE). This has been decided in keeping with the medium of instruction policy which the state government has adopted, where it is consciously promoting primary education in Konkani/Marathi medium. Fifteen institutes and trusts had sought permissions to open new English-medium schools from June 2018.

 While during the last two academic years, no new primary school was granted permission to begin operations, including Konkani/Marathi ones, during 2018-19 some new regional language schools are expected to be granted permission to open, director of education   said.
 
 “Konkani/Marathi schools will be granted permission to open if they are not affecting enrolment in neighbourhood schools,” said Bhat.
 
 For the academic year 2018-19, DoE has received 61 applications to open new primary schools in the state. Of these, 24 applications are from educational institutions and trusts to open Konkani-medium schools and another 14 to start Marathi-medium schools. DoE has received applications to begin seven new   medium institutions and one application to open a Sindhi language school.
 
 For   or Marathi-medium primary schools, the state has relaxed the distance criteria from neighbourhood schools. As a result, between 2012 and 2016, over 90 regional language schools were allowed to begin operations.
