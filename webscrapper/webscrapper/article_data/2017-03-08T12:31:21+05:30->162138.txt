SHIMLA :To end Chinaâ€™s monopoly in supplying   to manufacture  , now India too is going to produce the special acid for which   Pradesh has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Indian Synthetic Rubber Private Limited ( ), Panipat, for providing basic engineering package for the preparation of the acid.

 At present, only China has the patented technique. Sources said that special rosin acid along with some chemicals is used in making anti-skid tyres and Japan too knows about it.
 
 Japan has collaborated with ISRPL after which Panipat-based company has contacted Himachal to procure rosin as state has two factories for the same at Bilaspur and Nahan. MoU was signed on Monday between HP State Forest Development Corporation and ISRPL, Panipat, by the managing directors of both, C S Singh and   respectively, in the presence of forest minister Thakur Singh Bharmouri.
 
 Bharmouri said so far disproportionate rosin was being imported from other countries by spending a huge amount of foreign currency. He said this was the first effort in India to prepare the special rosin acid which would help in cutting down expenditure on the import. He also said ISRPL has provided technique of preparing rosin acid to the state and assured all possible assistance.
