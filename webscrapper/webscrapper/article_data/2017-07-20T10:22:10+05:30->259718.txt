PUNE: The forest department’s plan to develop a garden named after ‘Swayam’, the first satellite designed by students of College of Engineering, Pune, on Hanuman tekdi has not gone down well with the members of the   (DGPS) and activists alike.

 They said that a tekdi, a Marathi word for hill, should remain a ‘tekdi’, and no garden should be planned on it.
 
 Sushma Date, member, DGPS, said, “We were shocked to learn that the forest department is setting up a garden on Hanuman Tekdi. The proposed garden may also have an installation of the fibre replica of ‘swayam’ and an open air theatre to showcase their work through a 15-minute film. This is a commendable effort by COEP students, but we fail to see why it must be showcased inside a reserved forest land on tekdi. There is ample space on non-forest lands in the city for this, which will also be easier for people to access,” she said.
 
 Date said that there was opposition from citizens to the forest department’s proposal to set up an amphitheatre in the Vetal Tekdi quarry in 2012, and in 2014, a similar proposal of a nature trail was opposed by more than 5,000 citizens. 
 
 DGPS member Sumita Kale said that the forest minister should put a stop to the desecration of the fragile eco-system of Pune tekdis and work towards conservation of the last few open, natural spaces left in the city.
 
 Civic activist   said that the tekdi should remain in its current state of natural wilderness and not be converted into a park. “A park will attract picnics and crowds. The tekdi should remain a ‘tekdi’ with minimal human interference,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, a forest department official said that the garden has been planned as per the environmental guidelines recently framed by the government, after the eco-tourism board came into existence. “Developing tekdi is part of a comprehensive decision to develop all hillocks in the state, but within the boundaries of environmental laws,” he said.
