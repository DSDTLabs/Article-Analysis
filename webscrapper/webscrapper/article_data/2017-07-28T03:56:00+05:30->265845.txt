Porvorim: Chief Minister   on Thursday approved a policy decision whereby   (CoP) will be required to consult   (GTDC) before issuing permissions for cruise boats.

 “A policy decision has been taken to ensure that CoP coordinates with GTDC before issuing permissions,” Parrikar said while answering a question tabled by   seeking to know the total amount of entertainment tax collected by the government from private cruise boat owners conducting tourism-related excursions.
 
 Cabral said many of the private cruise boats operators evade entertainment tax, which deprives the government of revenue.
 
 “They will all be asked to pay tax,” said Parrikar, adding that with the implementation of GST, luxury tax is no more in force. The government will ensure that all boat operators with income of Rs 5,000 a day are brought under the ambit of GST, Parrikar said.
