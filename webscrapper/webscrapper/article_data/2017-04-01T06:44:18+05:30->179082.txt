MEERUT: Angry at spotting menstrual blood in the toilet that no one owned   to, an angry warden of a residential school in UP’s   forced 70 of her students to strip naked in class before she checked each one of them.

 The traumatised girls are in the age group of 12 to 14 years and study in classes 6 to 8.
 
 Under pressure from shocked parents, the district magistrate sacked the warden, Surekha Tomar, who was in charge of the governmentrun Kasturba Gandhi Junior Residential School in Khatauli, where the incident happened on March 26.
 
 A defiant Tomar said, “I still say what I did was right because I believe in cleanliness and discipline. These girls and the staff members of this school have united against me because they do not want a strict warden.”
 
 One of the girls said, “The warden found bloodstains on the door of the common toilet and summoned all of us to a class and inquired who was menstruating. When none of the girls replied, she separated the younger girls from the older ones and asked all of us to take off our clothes. She then started inspecting us herself, which was really humiliating.” Another student said, “Some of the girls broke down and started crying, others began protesting.”
