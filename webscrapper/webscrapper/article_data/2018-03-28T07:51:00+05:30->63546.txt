Amritsar: Claiming to have been reeling under the alleged ‘anti-farmers’ policies, various peasant bodies have urged the government to make farming a remunerative profession with a minimum salary of Rs 18,000 per month for non-skilled workers. They have also demanded that the Border Security Force (BSF) be instructed not to harass farmers going beyond the border fence to work in their fields situated close to the international border with Pakistan.

 Talking to TOI farmer leader Gurnam Singh Daud alleged that the Punjab government had failed to fulfill the promises made to people of the state ahead of the last assembly elections. Talking about work opportunities, he said labourers were getting work for only two months in a year.
 
 “Their condition is miserable,” he said, further demanding round-the-year job guarantee for everyone in the state. He said the government should immediately allot 10 marla (250 sq yards) plots to the homeless and a grant of Rs 5 lakh for the construction of houses.
 
 Expressing concern over suicides by farmers, another prominent farmer leader Rattan Singh Randhawa said the government should waive off their loans and make agriculture a profitable profession by at least implementing the recommendations of the M S Swaminathan commission’s report.
 
 Meanwhile, farm expert Satnam Singh Ajnala said the BSF often harassed farmers going to till their fields situated beyond the border fence. “Instructions should be given to the BSF to not harass farmers and instead cooperate with them. Else, we will be forced to begin an agitation,” he said.
