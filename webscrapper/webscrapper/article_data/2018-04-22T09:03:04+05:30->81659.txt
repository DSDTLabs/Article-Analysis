AHMEDABAD: His name is Yatrik and he is now embarking on a new journey. Yatrik Zaveri, 59, a partner in Motilal Dahyabhai Zaveri & Sons — one of the oldest diamond firms in Mumbai — will don the whites of a monk in the presence of family and friends on Sunday.

 Born in Ahmedabad, Zaveri joined the family business in his late teens. He was drawn to the teachings of   during a lecture series in   about year-and-a-half ago and decided to renounce family and society to become a Jain monk. 
 
 On the eve of the diksha, Zaveri said that he was fortunate to get the support of his family including his wife, son, daughter, and grandchildren when he was mulling the big decision. “I see it as going from my house to a new house where I will have thousands of family members.
