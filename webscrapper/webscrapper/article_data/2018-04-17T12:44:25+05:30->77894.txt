PANAJI: A delegation of small traders and vendors on Monday met chief secretary   and demanded a relaxation of the condition that requires deploying fire safety equipment for the renewal of trade licenses. The delegation was led by   spokesperson Dattaprasad Naik.

 On January 18, North Goa collector  , in her capacity as chairman,  , ordered all panchayats, municipalities, and the Corporation of the City of   to ensure that commercial establishments in their jurisdiction comply with fire safety norms. She also said that no trade licences would be renewed until fire safety norms were complied with.
 
 The delegation told Sharma that the traders registered in panchayats and municipal councils are mostly small or marginal traders with a small quantum of turnover as compared to other states. These businesses, the delegation said, are largely situated in rented premises or in temporary sheds. The group told Sharma that traders would find it difficult to install the necessary equipment if compelled to do so in a strict time-frame. 
 
 “Non-renewal of trade licenses would further add to their hardships and would directly impact their dependant families too,” the delegation said, adding that even within the jurisdiction of the CCP, businesses are run by small traders, barring a few major business units. 
 
 The delegation also told the chief secretary that this issue has been discussed with chief minister Manohar Parrikar. However, due to his unavailability at the moment, it sought the intervention of the chief secretary. The delegation also demanded that the time-frame for the implementation of these norms be extended by a minimum of 90 days. The delegation demanded that panchayats, municipalities, and the CCP be asked to immediately create committees for interaction with concerned traders to arrive at a consensus.
