 “The fire broke out around 1.45pm and spread over a 5,000-squarefoot area on the ground floor to damage the electrical wiring, installations, wooden furniture, sofa sets and false ceiling before it was brought under control by nine fire engines,” said a fire officer. 
 
 A spokesperson of Mumbai Airport Private Limited said that the fire was brought under control “within no time” and that it did not impact flight operations or any of the passengers. Chief fire officer P   said that there was a lot of smoke owing to the fire, but the blaze was contained as soon as they could. A total of nine fire engines were deployed on the job apart from water tankers and ambulances which had been kept on standby. 
 
 “The fire erupted in a corner area and therefore it did not affect air traffic movement in any way. We tried to contain the fire in a limited area itself,” said a senior official from the fire brigade.
