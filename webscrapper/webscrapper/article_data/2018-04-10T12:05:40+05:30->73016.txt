LUCKNOW: In yet another first, flying squads will inspect   where madrassa students will appear in their board examinations from April 16. This year, madrassa examinations are being held under   vigil too for the first time. 

 The minority welfare department has constituted flying squads and internal inspection committees at four levels: examination centre/school, district,   ( ) and directorate.
 
 According to the government order, a three-member internal inspection committee has been constituted at centre level. At the district level, concerned district magistrates will form flying squads lead by district inspector of schools ( ), basic education officer, district backward welfare officer and district minority welfare officer.
 
 At UPBME level, the chairman and registrar will make surprise visits while at directorate level, director of minority welfare department, joint directors and assistant directors will inspect centres across the state.
 
 This is the first time that UPBME is holding the examination the way UP board does. The flying squads have been formed to maintain transparency at all levels,” said UPBME registrar, Rahul Gupta. “We have also, for the time, given exclusive username and password to each exam centre through which they can monitor number of students, madrassas and admit cards. Absentees’ details will also be updated daily on the portal,” he added.
 
 The order strictly mentions that only women flying squad members will check female students. A total of 2,73,027 madrassa students will appear in examinations. The department has finalised 648 examination centres, of which 54 are exclusively for female students and 54 exclusively for males.
