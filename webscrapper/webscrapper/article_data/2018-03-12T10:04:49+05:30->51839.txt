Pedestrian safety is a matter of concern not only within   but also outside the premises, especially for commuters making their way to the bus stop across  

 To provide safe walking space for commuters,   has proposed to construct a foot over-bridge linking the railway station with   Road bus stop. The FOB will have escalators to provide easy access to senior citizens.
 
 
 According to corporation officials, the Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure Financial Services Limited (TNUIFSL) will appoint consultants to study the bridge’s feasibility and prepare a detailed project report.
 
 The special officer’s council had granted approval to appoint consultants on January 31. “A pre-bid meeting was held on March 1. This is a statutory process and held before tenders for consultant appointment are called for. If things fall in place, the bridge will be completed in 12-15 months,” said a senior corporation official.
 
 R Jayaseelan, who alights at Guindy station and takes the bus towards   from Race Course Road, told TOI that crossing the busy stretch was cumbersome. “Nobody slows down to allow pedestrians to cross the road. During peak hours, the risk of getting hit by vehicles is higher. Two-wheeler riders are especially insensitive to our plight,” he said.
 
 The corporation dropped a previous plan to construct a magic box at Race Course Road before finalising on building an FOB.   are pedestrian subways that are only partially sunk below ground level, like those found on certain highways.
