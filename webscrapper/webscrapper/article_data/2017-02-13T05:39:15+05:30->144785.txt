LUCKNOW:   president   on Sunday claimed that his party would win 50 out of 73 seats of western  , and said the party would have a direct fight with the BSP, not the ruling SP in the state, in the second phase as well. “The BJP would get more than 90 seats in the first two phases,” Shah told reporters at a press conference here. The election to the 67 seats in the second phase would take place on February 15.

 He, however, added that in the remaining five phases, the BJP’s main rival would be the Samajwadi Party.
 
 Citing the reason, he said that since both the phases are being held in the same region, the BJP believes it would have a direct contest with the BSP and later on it would have direct contest with the SP
 
 Political analysts say his earlier claim that the BJP was pitted against the SP was an attempt to polarise voters on communal lines. However, his Sunday statement was being seen as the BJP’s attempt to divide minority votes between the SP and the BSP. “This would consolidate Hindu votes in favour of the BJP,” they say.
 
 Shah attacked the SP and its alliance with the Congress. He said the tie-up was not on “ideological lines” and it was an “unholy alliance”. “Nothing has changed in the SP strategy,” Shah said. The SP felt that it would lose the elections, hence it gave over 100 seats to the Congress, he added.
 
 He slammed that the poor law and order situation in the state. “Akhilesh Yadav failed to bring ‘acchhe din’ in UP. From March 11, the people of the state would see ‘acchhe din’ in the state,” Shah said.
