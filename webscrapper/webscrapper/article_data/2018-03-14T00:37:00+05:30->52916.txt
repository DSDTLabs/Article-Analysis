Madurai: The Madras high court Madurai bench has directed the government to get instructions from the Tuticorin police on a plea accusing them of denying permission to hold a public meeting to spread awareness about health hazards allegedly caused by   Industries in that district. 

 One Krishna Moorthy from Tuticorin filed a case. It came up before justices P Rajamanickam for hearing. The petitioner’s counsel told the court that due to functioning of Sterlite Industries situated in SIPCOT, air and ground water are getting polluted. Regarding that, the petitioner’s organisation Makkal Iyakkam is spreading awareness among public.
 
 Ahead of it, the organisation decided to hold a public meeting at Rajaji Park near Old Tuticorin Corporation Building on March 9 and sought permission with the Tuticorin police on February 26. But, on March 4 they refused permission. Now, the petitioner’s organisation has planned to hold the meeting on March 17 in the same location. Hence, it was necessary to direct the police to accord permission for the meeting, the counsel said. The court wanted an instruction and adjourned the case.
