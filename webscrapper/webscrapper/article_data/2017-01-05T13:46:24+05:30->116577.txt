BENGALURU: Instances of molestation on the city streets are no secret, and women have spoken up against it.While many fingers have been raised against cops,  , including a woman officer who was featured in many photographs of alleged molestation on Brigade Road, narrate a different version of what transpired that night.

 The female officers said that a woman in a black top, who was holding on to her in the photograph, came out after celebrations and asked her for help to find her friends, who were nearby . The officer said the woman didn't complain of any molestation and had only asked for help to find her friends. “We found her friends and took her to safety,“ she added.
 
 Another officer said that a woman, dressed in white, had hurt her foot and needed support even to walk. The officer said he gave her water, sat her down and later helped her get home. Even this girl, he said, needed help to get home and didn't report to him being molested by the crowd.
 
 Senior police officers said that since the photographs surfaced, the officer was questioned to understand the incidents that unfolded on New Year's Eve. Officers said available footage of the women featured in the media were checked, and no visuals of them being molested were found. “As visuals of these women were not available and they didn't report any incident to officers who were helping them, how can we book a case?“ asked the officer.
