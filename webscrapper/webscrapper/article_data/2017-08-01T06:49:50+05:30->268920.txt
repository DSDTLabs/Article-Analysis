CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday asked the Punjab government to follow Haryana’s crop procurement system. On Punjab government’s excuse about shortage of funds, a division bench headed by Justice   said the court would not hesitate in directing the liquidation of Markfed and asking Hafed to take it over. 

 The bench made the observations after it was told that Haryana had been managing crop procurement without depending too much on funds.
 
 During the hearing of the case, the court was informed that Haryana would purchase sunflower crop with just Rs 10 crore before storing it in a warehouse. The crop in the warehouse was then pledged for Rs 10 crore with a bank. The amount was again used to procure crop and the cycle continued.
 
 The Union government’s counsel also told the HC that the procurement cap of 25% of the total sunflower seeds production was not absolute and could go up. It was added the Centre was considering relaxation of the cap and instructions were likely to be issued soon.
 
 The matter is pending before the HC in the wake of a PIL filed by   Union (BKU), arguing that the minimum support price (MSP) of agriculture produce had been fixed much below the actual production cost and even that was not being given to farmers.
 
 Submitting that such reasons were forcing the farmers to commit suicide, the petitioner stated that the   record showed that between 1995 and 2010, there were 2.56 lakh suicides of Indian farmers and a   of these related to the impact of the agrarian crises. The PIL has sought direction to implement the MSP policy and compensate the farmers for the losses suffered by them.
