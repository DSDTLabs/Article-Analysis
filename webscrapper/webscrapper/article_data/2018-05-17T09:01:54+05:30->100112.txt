BATHINDA: Taking note of the irregularities in the construction of   bypass road and samples of road material failing to meet the quality standards,   minister   on Wednesday ordered suspension of the executive engineer (XEN) concerned and issued a show-cause notice to the superintending engineer (SE) for failure to supervise the work. The minister also ordered framing of a charge-sheet of the SDE and JE concerned.

 Singla and PWD secretary   had inspected the newly-laid road at Abohar on May 14 and had asked the quality control team to collect samples of the building material. He said as an elected representative of the people he would ensure that every penny of the public money was used in the right earnest and the department would not allow any substandard construction. The quality control team had taken samples of bitumen and chequered tiles put on the central divider. A visual inspection laid bare the fact that many chequered tiles were cracked and broken within 10 days of the construction.
 
 It was further observed that no cement mortar was used to place the tiles as required. The samples were examined in the research laboratory of the department. Preliminary investigation reveals that the quality of two samples collected on the spot were substandard and fell in the rejected category of materials, which prompted the minister to take prompt action, sources said. Minister Singla said the detailed investigation was on and necessary action would be initiated against the contractor.
