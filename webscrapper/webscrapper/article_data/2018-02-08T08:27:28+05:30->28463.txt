LUCKNOW: An aggressive Opposition led by   is likely to disrupt Governor Ram Naik’s joint address despite appeals by Speaker Hridaya Narain Dixit and chief minister Yogi Adityanath at the all-party meeting on Wednesday to run the House smoothly with mutual cooperation.

 The Speaker had called the all-party meeting to chalk out a joint plan for the Budget session beginning from Thursday.
 
 From Opposition, SP’s Ram Govind Chaudhary, BSP’s   and Ajay Kumar Lallu of   attended the meeting chaired by the Speaker while chief minister Yogi Adityanath as Leader of the House and Suresh Khanna as minister for parliamentary affairs represented the treasury benches.
 
 The meeting was held in cordial atmosphere with the Speaker appealing all members to run the House smoothly and not to cross limits.
 
 However, in a veiled manner Dixit also warned that any bad precedence of the past in the House should not be repeated. Dixit was referring to the throwing of paper balls at Governor during joint address in the last session.
 
 Dixit appealed to the legislators to act as responsible members of the House. He said that UP legislature should follow the ideal practice of   where President’s speech is heard in rapt attention without any noise or protests. CM Yogi said that all members should jointly work to run the House smoothly.
 
 But the mood in the Opposition camp seems to be belligerent and it might disrupt Governor’s address starting 11am.
 
 Samajwadi Party leaders alleged that law and order in the state has collapsed, innocent people are being killed in encounters, and farmers are in distress and hence the Opposition would not run away from its constitutional duties.
