NEW DELHI: Tomato prices have crossed Rs 90 mark in 17 major cities, including Delhi, Kolkata, Indore and Thiruvananthapuram, because of short supply of the vegetable.

 There is no immediate relief in sight as disruption of supply chains due to rains and floods and less availability is likely to continue at least till August-end.
 
 There are also reports of   rising in country’s largest wholesale onion market at   in Maharashtra. 
 
 It was a 19-month high at Rs 1,300 per quintal on Friday. “There is no fresh harvest right now and onions arriving in the market are from the storage harvested in March and April. But most of the small farmers have sold their stock... to meet requirement of money,” said an   source.
 
 In Delhi, the retail price for a kilo of tomato is Rs 92. It was at Rs 26 three months back and Rs 48 a year ago.
 
 Sources said arrival of onions at Lasalgaon dropped by almost 50% from 25,000 to 12,000 quintal per day and this has led to rise in average wholesale prices of the kitchen stable.
 
 In the case of tomatoes, the prices have sky-rocketed in just two months across cities – in Chennai it has increased five-fold between April and July, by six times in Bangalore and by nine times in Kolkata during the same period. The problem aggravated this year due to rains.
