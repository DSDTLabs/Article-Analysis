NEW DELHI: The hearing for Judge B H Loya’s “suspicious” death in the   on Thursday witnessed heated exchanges with a bench led by CJI Dipak Misra taking exception to senior advocate Dushyant Dave’s remarks about the court’s reluctance to sharply question the Maharashtra government for refusing to order an independent probe.

 “We don’t need a certificate of fairness from you,” said the bench, which also comprised Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, to Dave, who had earlier sparred with lawyers Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi appearing for the Maharashtra government.
 
 Dave, appearing for Bombay Lawyers Association, said the bench not view circumstance around Loya’s death simply as coincidence.   was conducting trial in the   case at the time of his death. Dave claimed the judge was not given proper medical treatment and the Maharashtra government did not conduct an adequate proper probe.
 
 When Dave questioned the conduct of judicial officers accompanying Loya on that day, the bench said the officers took a decision they considered best at that moment. The senior advocate, however, told the bench it should questions the state government for brushing the controversy under the carpet by ordering an administrative inquiry that was concluded within days.
 
 Justice Chandrachud took exception to Dave’s remarks and said, “Justice lies in our conscience. Justice lies in our minds.” 
 
 The bench assured Dave it would question the state government to decide whether the probe was conducted properly before coming to any conclusion. 
 
 At the outset of the proceedings, Dave said the state’s “discreet inquiry” did not inspire confidence and the court should reject it. He said the commissioner of intelligence conducting the investigation did not visit the site or interact with doctors and judicial officers.
