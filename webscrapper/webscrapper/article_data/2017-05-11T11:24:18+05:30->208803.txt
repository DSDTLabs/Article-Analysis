CHANDIGARH: As   have got vital clues on the murder of   alias Meet following the interrogation of   inmate Gagandeep Singh Dhillion,   are also planning to bring Gagandeep to Chandigarh on a   for his interrogation. 

 Moreover, Chandigarh Police have also prepared a list of members of rival groups of bouncers, who are reportedly ready for a clash following Meet's murder.
 
 "Currently, Mohali Police are interrogating Gagandeep, and once they are over with the interrogation, we will bring him here for questioning. Since the rivalry between both groups of bouncers has engulfed the Tricity in the past too, we want to take every precautionary and preventive measure to stop such crimes in our jurisdiction. We are keeping tabs on every situation in this regard," said UT SSP Eish Singhal.
 
 Significantly, cops of Chandigarh Police are already in the touch with Mohali Police over the interrogation of Gagandeep and gathering optimum information pertaining to Chandigarh. "The officers of the crime branch are keeping tabs on every situation and they have even visited Mohali for the purpose," sources revealed.
 
 Sources in the Chandigarh Police revealed that there is high suspicion that a group of bouncers who were associated with Meet may take revenge of his murder. Thus, the police have come up with a list of bouncers, who could become troublemakers. "We have the list of some of the bouncers, who may try to take revenge of Meet's murder. We are keeping a close eye on every situation. As the city already witnessed one such shootout in a gym last year, we are taking every measure to prevent such incidents," said senior police officer, pleading anonymity.
 
 In July 2016, Akhil Gere, a bouncer-cum-gym trainer, who was the closest friend of slain Amit Sharma was shot at inside the gym. Gera was injured, but he survived. Police had arrested four accused in that case, including Gagandeep, who is now been considered as the main conspirator behind Meet's murder.
