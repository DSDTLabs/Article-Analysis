Go back to work or face consequences, the Madras high court has warned striking transport corporation workers.

 “There will be an interim order restraining the transport workers, specially, the drivers and conductors, from taking recourse to strike. The striking worker shall report for duty. Any worker refraining from attending to work or performing duty shall do so at their own risk of the consequences thereof including termination of their services and penalisation for gross contempt of this court,” the first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice   said on Friday.
 
 Chief minister   also met ministers and bureaucrats at the Secretariat and later at his   residence. Minister M R   said the wage settlement was arrived at after 23 rounds of talks with the trade union representatives for more than a year. “The government has arrived at a best wage settlement than ever before. The move would incur an additional expenditure of Rs 1,000 crore. Though the workers have accepted the hike, a few unions are resorting to diversionary tactics,” the minister said. The bench passed the interim order on a PIL moved by   seeking direction to the state to take immediate steps to settle the issue and restore public order. Admitting the plea, the court said, “The transport workers provide essential public utility services. There can be no doubt that all employees are entitled to legitimately agitate their grievance.” However, strike calls like this cannot be countenanced. The state is bound to protect the right of free movement of citizens, the court said.
 
 The bench then ordered notices to the trade unions and posted the PIL to January 8 for further hearing.
