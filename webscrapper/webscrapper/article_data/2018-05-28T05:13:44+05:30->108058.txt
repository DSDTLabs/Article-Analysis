SRINAGAR: J&K CM   has welcomed Union home minister   Singh’s statement that the Centre is willing to have a dialogue with Hurriyat.

 
 In an interview to a TV channel, Singh said on Saturday: “If Hurriyat is ready to come to the table for talks, we are ready for it. However, as on date, there is no indication from them to this effect.” In an another interview to a newspaper, Singh had said New Delhi is ready to hold talks with   if it comes forward to hold talks. “To not welcome anyone who wants to talk is not the right thing,” he said.
 
 Hailing Singh’s statement as a “welcome step”, Mehbooba said given the positive outcome from the ground on the “Ramzan ceasefire” in J&K, the government should feel encouraged to start the much-needed process of peaceful engagement with all stakeholders in the state.
 
 She hoped groups like Hurriyat would seize the opportunity and show their responsibility towards the people of the state by displaying the much-needed maturity so that the opportunity was not wasted.
 
 Sources said Centre’s interlocutor Dinesh Sharma has suggested the Centre to open dialogue with the Hurriyat leadership besides addressing the day-to-day problems of the Kashmiris.
 
 Though the Hurriyat has not reacted to Singh’s statement, its chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq had in a tweet on Friday expressed his group’s willingness to engage in a dialogue on Kashmir.
