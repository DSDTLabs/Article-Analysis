Lucknow: On the speculation that his entry into   from Gujarat would eventually get him a   in the Modi cabinet, national BJP chief   said, “Aap log dhakka mat lagaiye (don’t push me, please). I am the   and happy with the role.” 

 On the third and last day of his visit to the state capital on Monday, Shah took a jibe at the Congress over its MLAs quitting the party in Gujarat. On being asked if the BJP had orchestrated the split shortly before the Rajya Sabha elections, Shah said the accusation was baseless and added, “Why are the MLAs locked up in a resort in Bengaluru, when Karnataka has a Congress government? It seems the party does not trust them, so they have been made prisoners.” 
 
 Asked to comment on the prospects of Shivpal Yadav quitting Samajwadi Party to join the BJP, Shah said, “We haven’t discussed about him yet.” 
 
 On the recent developments in Bihar, Shah said, “The BJP neither divided any party, nor caused the fall of any government. Nitish Kumar resigned from the chief minister’s post as he did not want to continue with the corrupt.” Speaking about the law and order situation in UP, Shah said the BJP government got the state in a very bad situation, so it will take CM Aditya Nath Yogi some time to put UP on the path of development. 
 
 On why he chose to have lunch on Sunday at the house of a member of the Yadav community, Shah said it was as per the decision of the local BJP unit and added that earlier he had eaten at a dalit’s house. “In the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, the BJP would get more seats than it secured in 2014,” said Shah, adding that the development agenda of the Modi government and successful rule of BJP in 13 states would help them achieve the goal.
