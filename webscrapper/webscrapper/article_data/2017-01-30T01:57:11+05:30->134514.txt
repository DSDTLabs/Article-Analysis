NEW DELHI: Miscreants decamped with Rs 8.9 lakh from a   in east   on Saturday. A   has been registered. Cops suspect that some of bank’s employees could be involved. A few people are being questioned.

 The theft was discovered when security guards reached the   kiosk on Sunday morning and found the locker broken. They informed the bank, which called the cops. When police reached the kiosk, it was found that the ATM’s CCTVs were damaged. They had also vandalised the ATM machine and removed the locker. It seemed the thieves had a duplicate security key that they used to open the lid of the machine.
 
 “It seemed the accused entered the kiosk through the door accessed by the guards and were familiar with the functioning of an ATM machine. We have requested the bank to share details of the officials in charge of the kiosk,” said Omvir Singh, DCP east.
 
 Locals said that the ATM had been refilled on Saturday after being out of cash for the past two days. Cops said the cash is usually carried by custodians employed by the bank who also have access to the key and security codes to the locker.
