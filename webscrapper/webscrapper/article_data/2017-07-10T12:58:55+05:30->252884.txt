 Army personnel were roped in last week after the state government sought Army help to evacuate persons in the severely-affected areas.
 
 Chief Minister N Biren Singh, during inspection of the flood situation in Thoubal and Imphal East districts on Saturday last, had assured rehabilition for the affected, particularly whose residences were swept away by Imphal River.
