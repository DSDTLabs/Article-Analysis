Last week TimesofIndia.com had written about how   was losing its charm and becoming repetitive but the makers seem to have taken note of it and they were back with a bang in the new episode which aired on Sunday (February 19).

 Like always we had special guests from Bollywood - this time it was   and   promoting their upcoming movie, Rangoon.
 
 Kangana seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the show. In the beginning, it looked that Dr Mashoor Gulati, played by the very talented  , will walk away with all the limelight but it wasn't just him who had the audience in splits,   also returned as Rajesh Arora.
 
  
  
 Together, Rinku Bhabhi and Rajesh Arora were a killer combo. Rajesh's continuous nagging and making fun of Rinku's face and then calling Rinku Bhabhi names made both the guests laugh their heart out.
 
 And Kiku Sharda as Rinku's nanad (sister-in-law) talking about how she has learnt 'udru' (Urdu) was too sweet.
 
 Rajesh Arora's character has made a comeback on the show due to public demand. His style and one liners like mujhe tumhari baat bilkul pasand nahi aayi have become favourite among the viewers.
 
 Former cricketer and politician   gave standing ovation to both Kapil and Sunil for their outstanding act.
