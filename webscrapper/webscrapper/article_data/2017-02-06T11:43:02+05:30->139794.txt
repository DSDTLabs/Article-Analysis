VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra University offers language courses in three   till date — French, German and Japanese. However, the university authorities want to extend the activities of this Foreign Language Centre by introducing various other foreign languages such as Mandarin and Spanish to ensure that the Centre becomes a premium foreign language institute in the state. 

 Speaking to TOI,  , head of the centre, there are only three teachers, one each for the three foreign languages being offered. “The department was started in 2014 and today we have three foreign languages in the offing. The whole idea was to use AU as a base for foreign language courses, what with the ‘Look East’ policy beginning to take off from Visakhapatnam.”
 
 Prof Murthy stated that the whole idea was to introduce languages that have a worldwide presence and which would help foster greater business and cultural ties both in Asia and elsewhere. Au vice-chancellor   made it clear that he would want to see the department develop into a full-fledged and robust foreign language department almost on the lines of EFLU.
 
 “The whole idea is to promote foreign language teaching in AU, make the university a base for learning foreign languages in Andhra Pradesh, especially post bifurcation and also facilitate greater contact in industry and business circles as well. The department should not merely have an academic bent, at the end of the day, it should also be linked to promoting commerce and industry and that will happen only if we offer more courses and have a greater number of staff”,” the VC said.
 
 The authorities, however, pointed out that the department was still young in terms of age and as far as funding was concerned it was limited. Sources in the university also added that Vizag being the most cosmopolitan city in AP should have such departments in the university.
