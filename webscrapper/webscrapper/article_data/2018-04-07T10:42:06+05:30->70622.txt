PANAJI: Goa medical college and hospital’s ( ) request for two kidneys of B  , was declined. Rao’s family had donated his organs on Thursday.

 GMC has conducted 16 live kidney transplants till date. However, the government-run hospital could not get the organs despite it being the nearest transplant facility to   hospital, where the retrieval was conducted on Friday afternoon. 
 
 Dean of GMC,   said they were not given the kidneys as the hospital lacked a cadaveric transplant facility, and only had to be content with the corneas.
 
 “We contacted the regional organ tissue transplant organisation (ROTTO), but our request was declined as we don’t have a cadaveric transplant facility,” the dean said.
 
 A senior GMC doctor said they were ready to conduct a transplant if the kidneys were provided. 
 
 Dr Amol Mahaldar, consultant nephrologist at Manipal hospital, said that since Goa doesn’t have a cross-matching facility, the kidneys could not be donated locally. “The directive came from the ROTTO director. Since there is no state organ tissue and transplant organisation (SOTTA) in Goa, we come under ROTTO. We approached ROTTO when family expressed their desire to donate the organs,” said Mahaldar.
 
 Chairperson of Rotary Eye Bank of Goa, Vijay   said the corneas retracted by GMC doctors on Friday would be sent to a Pune-based hospital, as there is no one on the eye bank waiting list whose requirement meets that of the corneas harvested from Manipal hospital. Priyolkar also said he has been informed by GMC doctors that there is no match for the retracted corneas. Goa’s waiting list for corneas consists of four names.
