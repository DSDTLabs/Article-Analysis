NEW DELHI: Yogendra Yadav-led  , which will make its electoral debut in the civic elections, released its vision document, ‘Saaf Dil, Saaf Dilli’, for municipal governance on Sunday. The party said its main agenda would be to clean the city and provide an accountable and sustainable model of governance at the municipal level.

 “We believe in swaraj. People should have the power to decide on matters concerning their well-being. We believe that participatory, accountable and responsive governance must begin at the village/municipal level. This is why   India is beginning its electoral journey from the grassroots,” said Yadav while releasing the vision document and an action plan to make Delhi free of garbage, epidemics and pollution.
 
 Anupam, its spokesperson, said the party would focus on improving the sanitation condition and set up a control cell for vector-borne diseases like dengue, chikungunya and malaria. Delhiites have suffered a lot in the past few years due to poor sanitation that led to a spurt in dengue and chikungunya cases, said party members. 
 
 The party will focus on setting up an effective solid waste management system by roping in ragpickers. If voted to power, it also promises to rectify the working condition of sanction workers, plan for better drainage system, check burning of green waste and vacuum-clean roads.
 
 According to the vision document, Swaraj India plans to improve the financial condition of the corporations through “corruption-less tax collection, re-categorisation of colonies by a new valuation committee, fuller utilisation of existing advertisement and parking facilities, and creation of new spaces”. It will also push for the implementation of the   report.
