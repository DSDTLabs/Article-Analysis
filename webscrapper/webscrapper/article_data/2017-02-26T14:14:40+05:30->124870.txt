Actress   found herself in the eye of a storm when she went against the age old bull taming practise. The actress who is also a PETA supporter (the NGO which sought for the ban on the sport from the Supreme Court) deleted her social networking account after facing countless attacks online. 

  
  
 Before she deactivated her account, she informed her fans that she was forced to take this step until she can decide a further course of action. The row erupted on Saturday when a group of Jallikattu supporters protested against Trisha, while she was shooting for her film 'Garjanai'. The star along with her team was thus forced to leave the shoot midway. Constant hate comments from pro-Jallikattu supporters prompted the actress to leave the micro blogging platform. 
 
 Actors  ,   and   have come forward to ask people to respect the actress' views and not to abuse her for the same.
