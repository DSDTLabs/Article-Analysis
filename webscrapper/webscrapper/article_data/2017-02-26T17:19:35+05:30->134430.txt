Dileep's upcoming movie Ramaleela will have the actor playing a politician again after Lion, and now we got to know that the character has a strong political lineage too.

  The movie's director Arun Gopy had earlier told us that Raadhika   would be playing  's mother in the movie. 'Her character is called Sakhaavu Ragini. She's a strong-willed woman who is politically active and involves herself in the social affairs in the place she resides. That's also the reason behind her nickname Sakhaavu,' says Arun. The movie would mark Raadhika's Mollywood comeback after 24 years.
  Dileep plays an MLA in the film, which has already finished its schedules in Palakkad and Ernakulam. 'The relationship between the mother and son is a major thread in the movie,' says the director. 'We will next shoot in Goa, Maharashtra and Maldives.'
 
  Apart from Raadhika and Dileep, the movie also has a large cast that includes Prayaga Martin, Mukesh, Salim Kumar, Siddique, Vijayaraghavan, Suresh Krishna, Renji Panicker and Kalabhavan Shajon.
 Mukesh would be playing a police officer who is in his 60s. 'He's a veteran DYSP named Paul Devassy and very different from what Mukesh has played so far,' says the filmmaker. Meanwhile, Salim Kumar too has a pivotal role in Ramaleela, which is scripted by Sachy.
 
  Can the audience expect any rib-tickling comedy from Dileep and Salim Kumar duo? 'Actually, they won't have many combination scenes but Salim Kumar's got a full-length role in the movie parallel to Dileep's track. However, there is a layer of light humour throughout the movie,' says the director.
