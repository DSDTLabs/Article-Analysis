MUMBAI: BMC’s octroi collection till the evening of March 31 had touched Rs 7, 200 crore approximately, while the civic body has net approximately Rs 4,477 crore as property tax. 

 The property tax collection is less than the target set by the BMC. The civic body had estimated a revenue of Rs 5,200 crore through property tax. For octroi, the BMC’s target was Rs 6,950 crore . In the last financial year, the BMC’s revenue from octroi was Rs 6,300 crore, which fell short of the target of Rs 6,800 crore. The civic body was expecting that it would meet its target for property tax as well. 
 
 Civic officials said that stringent vigilance at octroi nakas and the increase on the levy on crude oil from 3% last year to 4.5% led to the rise in revenue income. “All measures were put in place to meet the target, considering that last year we fell short of the target. In case of property tax, defaulters were served notices and some of the properties belonging to defaulters were sealed,” said a civic official. 
 
 The BMC will not be able to collect octroi, considering the same is being replaced by the Goods and Services Tax. In the recent civic budget, the BMC had estimated the income from octroi for the first three months at Rs 1,356.25 crore.
