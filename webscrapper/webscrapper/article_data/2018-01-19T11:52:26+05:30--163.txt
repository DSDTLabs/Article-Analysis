Ram Charan is back in action once again as he began shoot for his untitled venture with director Boyapati Srinu on Friday. The film, which is being touted as #RC12 (the actor's 12th film), is produced by DVV Danayya and features Kiara Advani as the female lead. Charan's previous film was the blockbuster film 'Dhruva', remake of Tamil film 'Thani Oruvan'.  Dhruva released in December 2016, which means it's been more than an year since Ram Charan has featured on the big screen. And sure enough, there seems to a strong buzz as he gears up to return to action.  Announcing that the film will be going on floors, an excited Boyapati Srinu posted on social media, "Start camera. Action. My new film begins from today. #RC12 (sic)."  Charan also got a message of encouragement from his wife Upasana Kamineni. "Good luck Mr C   big day today.     (sic)," Upasana posted on social media. Meanwhile, the 'Maghadeera' star is also shooting Sukumar's film 'Rangasthalam'. "Rajamundry bound for the next few days...good to be back shooting closer to the beauty of Godavari and people's love here!! #Rangasthalam (sic)," Ram Charan posted on a social networking site.  Produced by Mythri Movie Makers, the film also features Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Aadhi Pinisetty and Jagapati Babu in important roles, and is slated to hit screens on March 30.
