AHMEDABAD: Labourers had been promised one free meal a day by the Vijay Rupani government. But the plan seems to have been only half-baked. The Gujarat Shramik Annapurna Yojana was scheduled to begin on May 1, Gujarat’s foundation day, which also happens to be the International Workers’ Day. The project was meant to ensure that 25,000 registered labourers did not begin their day’s toils on an empty stomach. 

 But since the authorities could not finalize the tender contracting an agency to supply food, the project has been delayed. It is now expected to start by the end of May. Though Dilip Thakor, the minister for labour and employment, attributed the delay to the process of issuing tenders, some office-bearers of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation’s elected wing have a different view of the situation. One office-bearer said, “We are yet to give identity cards to labourers. The cards were supposed to indicate the exact quantity of food to be supplied.”
 
 In 2013, Tamil Nadu took the lead in India in providing subsidized food. ‘Amma Unavagam’, canteens run by municipal corporations across Tamil Nadu, started serving hygienic food to the poor. Labourers and even some professionals found the canteens to be a boon. In August 2016, Gujarat announced the ‘Annapurna Rasoi’ — modelled on the TN scheme — for labourers at points where they gather daily to find work; the points are locally known as ‘kadia nakas’. The labour and employment department sent a proposal to the standing committee of the AMC to allocate space for the supply of food.
 
 The proposal was cleared by the AMC in October. But the scheme is yet to take off. The scheme was subsequently repackaged and announced in the state budget for the year 2017-18. Other states such as Karnataka, Rajasthan, UP, Delhi and   have already implemented schemes of a similar nature. Interestingly, the BJP-ruled governments of   in Rajasthan and of the newly appointed Yogi Aditya Nath in Uttar Pradesh have also begun such projects despite announcing them much after Gujarat did.
 
 Radheshyam Suthar, a resident of Vadaj, said: “Four months ago, at the Akhbarnagar kadia naka, some officials dropped by and took photographs and collected our details.” Suthar went on to say: “We were told that the scheme would begin soon and each labourer would get meal. But we haven’t yet received the identity card, let alone a meal.” Kishan Karnabhai, who frequents the Ambawadi kadia naka, said: “The government does not seem serious in implementing the scheme. Who cares for us? If other states can give food at subsidized rates, why can’t the Gujarat government?”
 
 Ramesh Ghanshyam, who was spotted in Akhbarnagar, said: “I am not regular at the Akhbarnagar naka and hence when officials arrived to collect our details, I was not there. I am told that I would not be eligible to get a meal because I am not a registered labourer with the  .”
 
 Labourers ‘diet’ surveyed
 
 “We had surveyed the diet of the labourers and based on that we are preparing their food packets,” said Dilip Thakor, the minister. “The labourers will get a new item in their food packets daily and one day a week we will even serve them sukhadi.”
 
 Pravin Patel, the AMC standing committee chairman, said: “Each labourer will get an identity card so that the exact quantity of food can be sent to various points.” Otherwise, he said, one day there would be shortage of food and wastage another day. “Once the cards are ready, the scheme will begin,” he said.

 Arvind Agaja, a labourer: The government should give us subsidized meals twice a day. Several states are doing that. Why can’t Gujarat? Even unregistered labourers should get food.
