Nearly six months after the release of his debut film  , actor and son of former Chief Minister  ,   is set to work on his next. After a lot of speculations on directors from both   and Telugu film industries, director   of   fame has been chosen to direct the film. Like Jaguar, this film is also a Kannada-Telugu bilingual film and will feature Nikhil in a commercial manner. There is no title finalized yet, but Chethan has apparently given Kumaraswamy title options.
A source from the film’s team tells us, “This film, unlike Jaguar, will present an emotional angle to the commercial tale. It has Chethan’s signature style. He has worked on films like Bahaddur and Bharjari and this film will also showcase a fun story. It will see Nikhil in 3-4 shades with maturity in every stage. Here, he doesn’t play a college student. He plays an emotional guy who is sensible and caring and is loved by all. It is something fresh.”
 The script puja for the film was done on Sunday, while the team plans to begin shooting from May end. “Nikhil was in the US training for the film. There will be a special action sequence in the first 10 minutes of the film. He has trained for this as this will be something new and special for South Indian cinema,” adds the source.
