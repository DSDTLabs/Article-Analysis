MUMBAI: Most farmers in rural areas are using the compensation for land along the Mumbai-Nagpur highway on longterm investments, but their counterparts in urban areas like Thane, Nagpur and Ahmednagar seem to be using the money to splurge on jewellery, cars and new homes.

 An MSRDC survey of nearly 6,500 farmers who got a total compensation of Rs 3,500 crore suggests that over 70% of them have invested the money for their children’s education and have opened fixed deposits.
 
 Though 50% of farmers aspire to buy agricultural plots again, only 18% of these 6,500 farmers have actually re-invested in land so far. The findings show that in Ahmednagar, Thane and Nagpur, only 1- 4% of farmers are doing so. In many cases, the sudden prosperity has led to change in lifestyle.
 
 Baban Harne, coordinator of  , said a majority of the farmers in Kalyan, Bhiwandi and Shahapur have bought vehicles and gold and were building houses. “Only 5% of farmers who are educated are investing the money for longterm gains. In many cases the brokers who promised good compensation to tribal farmers have taken away 10% of the payout as commission. As per law, farmers should get a plot of around 20% of their land as compensation, but here farmers have been rendered landless," he said. Also the promise of compensation has given rise to property disputes, he said pointing out that in Shahapur alone 26 such cases have been filed with local magistrates.
 
 Around 45% farmers are making investments and buying   machines, dumper trucks, transport vehicles besides building house and buying land. "Most of these vehicles will be rented out to contractors of highway project," sources said. The survey suggested that nearly 10% farmers have invested in other than core agriculture businesses such as dairy, poultry farming, grocery shops etc.
