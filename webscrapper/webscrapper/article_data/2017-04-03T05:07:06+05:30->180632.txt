GUWAHATI: Describing himself as a son of India, the Dalai   said on Sunday that he was the “longest staying guest“ of the Indian government and has now become a messenger of the country's culture.

 “I am the longest guest of the government of India... I am now paying back for that gesture by becoming the messenger of Indian culture,“ the Dalai Lama said.
 
 “...I have started describing myself as the son of India. A few years ago, some Chinese mediapersons came and asked why I say so. I told them that each part of my brain is filled with Nalanda thoughts,“ he added.
 
 In a tribute to   during the `Namami Brahmaputra' festival here on Sunday , the Dalai Lama said he feels a deep connection with the river. “My personal experience on the night of May 17, 1959, after escaping from the Summer Palace (in Tibet), makes me feel connected to the Brahmaputra. I crossed the river in  . I feel the same every time I come close to the river. The river festival reminds me of the sacredness of the river,“ the Tibetan spiritual leader said.
 
 The Dalai Lama said all major rivers in northern India originate from his homeland, Tibet, which he said is now part of the People's Republic of China. The Brahmaputra also originates in the Mansarovar in Tibet, where it's is called Tsangpo, he said. “The lives of crores of people depend on these rivers. So, you have the right to express your concern about the environment in Tibet as well,“ he said.
 
 Rejecting religious conversion by coercion, the Dalai Lama said, “Religion is an individual choice. Change of religion sometimes creates more confusion. Therefore, it is always better to keep original faith and try to understand about the value of religious teachings for peace and happiness.“
 
 “While I was in Tibet, I thought Buddhism was the best religion. But after coming to India and interacting with people of different faiths, I realized all religions are good as all emphasise on love,“ he said.
