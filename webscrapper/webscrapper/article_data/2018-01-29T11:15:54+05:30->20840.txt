HAVERI: It was a touching spectacle when a goods vehicle carrying a calf was followed by a cow in   on January 25. 

 The two-month old calf had injured itself and collapsed after the wounds became serious and infection had set in. Local residents informed the veterinary hospital, which sent workers to pick up the calf. Both the mother and calf were strays.
 
 As the goods vehicle picked up the unconscious calf and sped away from  , the cow ran till it reached the dispensary, which was half-a-km away. The calf had to be hospitalised and the mother cow stayed outside the hospital waiting for its offspring to come out.
 
 "We shifted the calf in a goods vehicle to the veterinary hospital. Our vehicle started from   to veterinary hospital, and the mother chased it,"  , a local resident said.
 
 Dr  , chief veterinary officer, said the calfs condition was serious when it was brought to the hospital. "It has recovered now. During the two days, the mother never left the hospital and stayed near the calf licking its wounds," he said.
 
 On Sunday, the calf was fit enough to be discharged.
