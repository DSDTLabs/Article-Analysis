SURAT: The statewide agitation by the staffers of 108 GVK EMRI for pay hike and better working conditions intensified on the fourth day on Sunday when news about three agitating employees falling unconscious in   reached Surat. 

 Kaushik Chavda, Tejal Patel and Mahesh Chauhan, who were on a hunger strike for the past three days, fell unconscious outside  . They were taken for treatment to   in a private vehicle because ambulance services in many parts of the state, including in Mehsana and Surat, have been paralyzed by the ongoing agitation. Dikshita Patel, a medical technician, had fallen unconscious in Surat on Saturday. However, 108 GVK EMRI management claims their services were unaffected in Surat and that no call for emergency has been missed.
 
 Shailesh Jat, who is on strike, said over 500 employees of 108 GVK EMRI in 12 districts of the state were on strike. “Our agitation will continue until we get justice,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, Satish Patel, head of 108 GVK EMRI in  , said, “We will file an FIR on Monday against the striking employees in Surat. We had already done so in Mehsana, Dang and   districts. The striking employees should end the agitation and discuss their grievances with us. Employee welfare has always been our top priority.” 
 
 The 108 GVK EMRI employees had also struck work in May to protest against dismissal of some workers.
