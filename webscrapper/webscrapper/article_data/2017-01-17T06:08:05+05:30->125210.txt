KHARAGPUR: After Trinamool, the state BJP has started ferreting the conspiracy theory, though with a difference. While   has been training her guns on the CBI, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh has demanded a   probe into the   murder case, claiming he had no faith in the state investigating agency. 

 The Kharagpur MLA has shot off a letter to Union home minister  , asking for “an independent CBI investigation” as “the police were following the ruling party line”. His request to the ministry of home affairs came in the backdrop of repeated insinuations by the police, the complainant and local Trinamool leaderships of a “BJP hand” in the killing.
 
 West Midnapore police superintendent Bharati Ghosh had earlier hinted “influential people” had conspired to murder Srinu, while Trinamool-controlled Kharagpur municipality chairperson Pradip Sarkar went a step ahead to call Shankar Rao, the arrested primary suspect, a BJP flag-bearer. In fact, Srinu’s mother, Ramanna Devi (55), who lodged a complaint against unidentified people, alleged Ghosh could have been involved in the murder. But Ghosh brushed aside the charges: “These are unsubstantiated allegations. But given the state’s penchant for putting BJP leaders behind bars on trumped-up charges, I wrote to the MHA.” 
 
 But Srinu’s wife, Pooja, a TMC councillor, refrained from levelling any allegation.
 
 Even as Ghosh spoke to reporters in Kolkata, Nanda Das—among the eight arrested—was produced before Midnapore second judicial magistrate Sharmistha Ghosh on Monday to record his in-camera statement that lasted 25 minutes. Seated in his prison van, Das dismissed any suggestion that Ghosh was involved but didn’t repeat the assertive denial when asked if Srinu’s rival, Rambabu, had a hand in the killing. Das, who allegedly provided the getaway vehicle to the killers, said he was under immense pressure. “Unidentified people have been threatening my family, wife,” he told reporters before being taken away by the cops.
