 "In a super power like India, many people, especially ladies cannot go to toilet when their body needs to because they don't have toilet in their homes and they need to defecate in open...

 The actor further urged people to help in building more toilets. 
 
 "We give donations in temples, gurudwaras, churches and masjid for blessings, can't we give 10 per cent of that donation to build a toilet for the poor."
