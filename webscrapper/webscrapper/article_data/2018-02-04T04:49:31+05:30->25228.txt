MUMBAI: Playing safe, the BMC, in its budget for 2018-19, has not made any major new announcements and has only taken forward its projects that were proposed in the earlier years like modernization of the  , popularly known as  , and Deonar abattoir. The civic body presented a Rs 27,258 crore budget on Friday.

 The textile museum which will be built on land that was taken over from the   ( ) in   too has found a mention this year again with an allocation of Rs 25 crore while the   lake beautification project that includes a walkway bridge and murals of Swami Vivekananda, has got Rs 3 crore. Most of these projects are yet to take off.
 
 Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria said that the BMC, instead of dragging its feet over projects which are yet to take off, could think of striking them off the board if they are not viable. “For instance, the textile museum has been making it to the budget for the past many years while in reality, things are yet to move on the ground,” he said.
 
 Big-ticket projects which have been in the pipeline for long too have got more allocations this year—the Mumbai Coastal Road got Rs 1,500 crore and the Goregoan Mulund Link Road Rs100 crore.   of NGO Praja said that instead of pumping out money from its coffers for projects that are unlikely to benefit the public at large, the BMC should make attempts to strengthen public transportation which is the need of the hour. “The coastal road will be used primarily by motorists and benefit only them. Public transport network is where huge sums should be pumped in,” he said.
 
 The   emphasized that the civic body’s revenue income has become primarily dependent on the growth of the real estate sector and hence, next financial year onwards, it will have to resort to withdrawal of funds from special reserves.
