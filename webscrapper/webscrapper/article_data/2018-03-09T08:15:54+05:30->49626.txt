HYDERABAD: Number of MTech seats in   are likely to drop by 50% for 2018-19 academic year as 28 engineering colleges under   (JNTUH) seek closure of 77 courses. The JNTUH is inspecting engineering, pharmacy and management colleges for affiliation. The inspection teams are verifying compliance of norms related to infrastructure, library, laboratories, faculty and biometric attendance in all colleges. 

 According to officials, there were nearly 16,000 MTech seats during academic year 2017-18, but 28 colleges sought no objection certificates to close 77 MTech courses. College managements attribute lack of mandatory resources sought by JNTUH in running MTech courses. "Stringent norms set by JNTUH has forced several colleges to shut the courses. Some of them include mandatory appointment of PhD qualified faculty, which is a challenge across India," said Srini Bupalam, vice-president of   of Self-Financing Institutions.
 
 He admitted that colleges were not seeking closure of courses due to lack of demand for MTech. College managements argue that closures are higher in the state as government wants to reduce the burden of fee reimbursement scheme by enforcing stringent affiliation norms.
 
 Apart from this, 11 engineering colleges have also sought progressive closure from the ensuing academic year. In addition, four colleges have decided to close seven courses in M Pharmacy, three colleges in MCA courses and one college in MBA. "While we received 282 applications for affiliations during 2017-18, this year it dropped to 266 for renewal of affiliations," said a JNTUH official privy to affiliation process.
 
 Few engineering colleges have moved court against JNTUH norms and affiliation deadline. Last year, JNTUH declared the list of affiliated colleges days before the counselling process. This year, college managements seek early release of affiliations.
