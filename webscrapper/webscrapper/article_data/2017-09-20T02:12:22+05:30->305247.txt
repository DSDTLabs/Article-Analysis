MUMBAI: The 2016-17  , which shows a deficit of Rs 590 crore, is   clearance for the last eight months, and now the undertaking is due to present its budget   for the 2017-18 financial year in a couple of weeks.

 “This is a strange situation,” said BEST panel member and civic opposition leader Ravi Raja. “While the previous budget is still not passed, BEST will have to introduce the new budget by October 10—the deadline for presenting the budget every year.” He added that unless the previous budget was cleared, it was not practically feasible to give expenditure estimates for the next fiscal.
 
 Last year, the BEST panel had given formal clearance for 2016-17 budget and tabled it before the  . “The standing committee passed the budget copy to the   for final approval,” said a panel member.
 
 The budget was rejected by the civic house and referred back to the BEST for a   in the budgetary estimates.
 
 Sources said BEST officials were asked to ‘adjust’ the losses as they cannot show a deficit budget for getting approval from the civic house. “The budget needs to be presented before the BMC with marginal profit of at least Rs 1 lakh in the revenue estimates. This has been the norm for the past several years,” said a BJP corporator.
 
 A BMC official said it was time BEST budget estimates for both fiscals were cleared at the earliest. 
 
 “The transport undertaking is reeling under huge losses and does not have money to pay its staffers on time,” he said. The official added that BMC had asked officials in the transport undertaking to introduce certain reforms/measures to curtail losses. “Unless they cut costs, it will be difficult for the cash-strapped undertaking to survive.” —Somit Sen
