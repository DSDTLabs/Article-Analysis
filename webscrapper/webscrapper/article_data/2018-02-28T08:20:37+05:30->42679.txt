  Madhur Verma, DCP, New Delhi, said, "Even our former chiefs try to attend it because it's more about bonhomie. And all the former and current officials get a chance to meet at a formal get-together. Every year, the Delhi Police Commissioner hosts the At Home ceremony and invites ministers and representatives from Central and State governments, as well as from the judiciary and bureaucracy, for this function. It formally brings together officials of different units to improve relations and maintain better co-ordination with us."
