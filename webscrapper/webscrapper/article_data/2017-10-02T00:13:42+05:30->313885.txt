Aurangabad: Prahar Apang Kranti Andolan, a group representing disabled people, is going to stage an indefinite hunger strike in front of the divisional commissionerâ€™s office from October 5.

 They will press for various demands including allotment and distribution of Unique Disability Identity (UDID).
 
 Shivaji Gade, the district chief of Prahar Apang Kranti Andolan is confident that the stir will pressurise civic bodies to release 3% of their budget, reserved for people with disabilities.
 
 Gade said that the government has directed that disabled people should be given priority in all government housing schemes. However, they are not getting anything.
 
 Through this agitation, participating divyangs also want to bring administrative focus on the unfulfilled promises of central minister of social justice and empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot. He had promised he would increase the monthly compensation of people with disabilities.
