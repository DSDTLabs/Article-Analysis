CHENNAI: It is worrying to note that the manufacturing growth rate in   has come down to 1.64% in 2016-17 compared to 7.10% in the previous year, said former   minister and   leader   on Friday. 

 Reacting to a TOI report on GSDP growth rate coming down in Tamil Nadu, Ramadoss criticised the state government for not taking proper steps to woo industries. "When   and   are able to grow at a higher rate, our state's growth rate has come down," he said. 
 
 "It is not surprising to know that the GSDP growth rate has come down in Tamil Nadu. But the manufacturing growth has also fallen badly and it is concerning as TN is a manufacturing state," said Anbumani. 
 
 The former minister blamed corruption for the fall in manufacturing growth rate. "The state does not have a proper industrial policy to woo new industries into the state. Above this there is corruption which is making industries to look at other states. Unless we wipe out corruption, our manufacturing growth rate will not increase," Anbumani said .
