NOIDA: Four days after nearly 4,500   employees of Noida   went on an indefinite strike, senior   officials once again held talks with leaders of the Noida Contractual Employees’ Association to end the deadlock. After detailed talks, protesters decided to end their strike and return to work on Saturday.

 Devender Kumar Sharma, president, Noida Contractual Employees’ Association, said, “We have been assured that our demands will be met and the state government apprised of our issues so that we can get redressal. Our main demand had been that the tender initiated by the Noida Authority to hire manpower be cancelled has been stayed. This was the first time in 20 years that the Authority had done this. This was unfair to us, who have been serving the Authority for more than a decade,” said Sharma. 
 
 Noida Authority officials confirmed that the strike had ended on Saturday. “All the demands of the contractual employees have been addressed,” said  , ACEO, Noida Authority, adding, “They have been asked to return to work immediately. Cleaning of the city took a hit during the strike. It will now be taken up immediately.”
