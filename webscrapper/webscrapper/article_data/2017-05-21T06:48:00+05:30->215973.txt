NAGPUR:   has decided to crack a whip against non-performing colleges operating in the state. A majority of them are functioning without full-time  , teachers and proper infrastructure, thus adversely affecting the quality of education in a progressive state, NU officials said.

 In a gazette notification dispatched to all traditional universities, the government barred principals and management representatives from such erring colleges from contesting the   for various statutory bodies like Board of Studies (BOS), Senate and Academic Council.
 
 Such persons can’t even be nominated on these bodies, unless they produce National Assessment and Accreditation Council ( ) certification of their respective colleges.
 
 Confirming the development, NU registrar Puran Meshram told TOI that latest notification from the government, based on new ‘Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016’, specifically prohibited heads and management members from affiliating institutions from contesting or participating in the elections, if they failed to secure NAAC certification.
 
 “The move is aimed at improving quality of education and infrastructure in colleges. The NAAC accreditation brings with it a slew of benefits. It becomes easier for them to seek funds from the bodies like University Grants Commission (UGC).”
 
 He added that even those securing accreditation, but failed to renew it subsequently after its five-year expiry period, wouldn’t be allowed to take part in election. 
 
 NU recently set up a specialized cell to frame modalities of the elections and oversee the process, at its main administrative block in front of Maharajbagh. A few years ago a similar cell was set by the university under former registrar Subhash Belsare for same purpose. However, after the government directed all universities to put the elections process on hold until new universities Act was implemented.
 
 NU officials however stated that the cell couldn’t function fully so far, as the government is delayed notifying the statues governing polls as per new Act. Subsequently, universities didn’t declare timetable for the elections, which would take at least a year to complete. After delay of over one and half months, the government finally issued them on Wednesday.
 
 Earlier, it was expected that the election process would commence in August, but due to delay in releasing the statues, it may go well beyond September-October.
 
 Deliberating on government’s latest diktats, officials disclosed that it would bar a majority of principals and management representatives from participating in the elections, as most of NU’s over 600 colleges are operating without teachers and facilities.
 
 “All such colleges are surviving on the scholarship amount granted by the government to backward category students. They’re opened only for the purpose of gobbling scholarship amount by showing fake students on the list. If honest inspection is conducted, most of them would be found in the list of defaulting colleges in the multi-crore scholarship scam,” they warned.
 
 They reminded that NU 250 banned colleges which were operating without regular teachers or facilities were still functioning in same way till date, after then government forced NU to lift the ban.
 
 In a nutshell:
 
 * State implements new ‘Maha Public Universities Act’ from March 1
 
 * But failed to release statutes for governing elections in varsities
 
 * Bars principals, mgt members if failed to secure NAAC accreditation
 
 * Majority of NU’s over 600 colleges operating without NAAC/NBA cert
 
 * Such colleges surviving only on scholarship amount from state govt 
 
 * NAAC brings with it, a slew of benefits like seeking funds from UGC
