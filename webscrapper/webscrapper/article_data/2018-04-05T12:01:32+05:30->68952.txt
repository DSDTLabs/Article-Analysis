A 30-year-old   from Kothrud was arrested on Monday for stealing costly   from   and neighbouring areas.

 Police recovered seven high-end bicycles from the watchman, Govardhanprasad Sahu. The collective price of the cycles is around Rs1.15 lakh. Assistant inspector Sandip Buwa of the Alankar police station said Sahu sold the stolen bicycles at throwaway prices. 
 
 Buwa further added that constable Yogesh Badage received a tip-off about Sahu using a stolen cycle for the past few days. During questioning, Sahu confessed to using it. He also confessed to stealing expensive cycles from Karvenagar and other areas.
 
 “Sahu mainly stole cycles from the parking lots of housing societies, sometimes even in front of the security guards,” Buwa said. 
 
 After stealing a cycle, Sahu would ride to the   and wait for customers there. He would sell the stolen cycle for Rs2,000-3,000. 
 
 “Sahu stole six cycles from the jurisdiction of the Alankar police and one from that of the Kothrud police,” Buwa said.
 
 A police team comprising constables Rajendra Langde, Nitin Kamle and   traced the six buyers and recovered the cycles from them. “Sahu worked as a watchman in different societies and also as a labourer,” Buwa said.
