NAVI MUMBAI: Around 50 school children from Vashi celebrated Valentine’s Day by sharing their love with strays and the poor and needy people.

 They pooled in their pocket money, purchased snacks and biscuits and distributed among poor and beggars. 
 
 They also fed strays and cows roaming in their locality. 
 
 “We have been taught that the day is meant for sharing love. So we decided to care for the needy and strays,” said Yash Shenoy, one of the many who pooled in their money for the endeavour.
 
 The children were guided by their art teacher Rupesh Shah. They also made placards with waste material to create awareness about saving the environment.
