As a ‘Ganda Bandh’ disciple of Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia from the age of 12 years, Rupak with arduous training and hard work, has mastered ‘Dhrupad,   and Tantrakari’ forms equally well. In fact, his recital is always a rare treat combining Dhrupad and Khayal styles, melodious ‘alap’ and ‘tatkar’ (tonguing technique used for jhala) innovative improvisation with mesmerising ‘layakari’, superb breath control and finger work.

The audience was thrilled to relish the recital as Rupak doled out with two ‘gats in madhyalaya ektaal’ and ‘drut laya teentaal’ respectively. He concluded the recital with tune based on ‘Rag Pahari’. The concert was accompanied by   on tabla.
 
 After the recital, Kathak dancer Madhumita took the stage and opened up with invocation of ‘Lord Ganesha’ in a piece ‘Ganesh Vandana’. In her next rendering, she presented Dhamar and Surdas Bhajan ‘preet kari kahu such na lahu’ amidst thunderous applause followed by group presentation of traditional Kathak set to teentaal. They concluded with crisp ‘Lasya tandava’ displaying subtle moods, graceful movements with sparkling footwork, all interpreting the concept and phrases of the composition much to delight of the audience.
