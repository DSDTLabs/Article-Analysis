Each of the segments of the upcoming portmanteau film   is based on a particular aspect of a woman’s life and features a different actress. 

 Madhupal’s   has   in the lead role. The director had earlier told us that the actress is playing a middle class mom in the movie but he now reveals more details. In the segment, which is based on a short story by PF Mathews, the actress is actually a sex worker, he says. 
 
 “Padmapriya plays a sex worker who gets cheated of her money one day. She is left penniless and takes to the streets, hoping that she can make some money. She tries to find some ‘clients’ but for some reason, luck fails her that day and she ends up unsuccessful. On the way back, she meets with an accident. The accident brings out another side of hers, that of motherhood. She realises that there is a mother inside her. The rest of the story is based on that aspect of hers.”
 
  Shoot is over for all the films and   is impressed by Padmapriya’s performance. “We shot in locations in the heart of Trivandrum, like Kizhakkekkotta and the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple premises. So the result was a hidden camera feel. Padmapriya played along beautifully, drinking tea from tea shops, chatting up with locals etc. She brought 100% perfection to the character. She gets exactly what a director wants from the character and can be called a genuine actress.”
 
 Apart from Padmapriya,   and a child artiste play the other important roles in the film.
