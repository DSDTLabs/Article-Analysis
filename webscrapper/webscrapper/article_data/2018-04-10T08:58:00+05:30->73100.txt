LUCKNOW: Exactly a month before, on March 9, SSP Lucknow had decided to divide the city into five   zones, each headed by an inspector, to improve traffic flow in the city. The planning, however, seems to have remained on paper only as the city witnessed one of the worst traffic nightmares on Monday. 

 When queried on the issue, SSP Lucknow Deepak Kumar said, "I don't build castles in the air. The plan will be implemented once our demand for more cops is met. There is a shortage of 452 cops in traffic police. We have been promised 250 constables soon. The   will be   then."
 
 The traffic police continues to grapple with shortage of manpower, equipment and proper traffic lights.
