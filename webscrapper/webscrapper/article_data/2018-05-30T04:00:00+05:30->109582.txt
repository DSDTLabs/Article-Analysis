Mumbai: The   board on Tuesday appointed former Bank of Baroda chief M D Mallya as an additional (independent) director for a five-year period subject to shareholder approval. Following the appointment, the number of independent directors on the board has gone up to six. 

 As against this, there are five executive directors, one government nominee chairman of LIC — its largest shareholder — who is also classified as an independent director. 
 
 Incidentally, the appointment comes a month before the bank’s chairman M K Sharma’s term comes to end, and when the lender is facing flak from the markets regulator Sebi for failing to meet disclosure requirements. 
 
 Sebi, in a notice to the bank and its CEO  , had said the lender had not made timely disclosure of dealings with Videocon group, and certain dealings allegedly between Videocon Group and   — an entity in which  , spouse of Chanda Kochhar, has economic interests.
 
 Prior to joining BoB, Mallya — who is 65 years of age — was the chairman of Bank of Maharashtra. He started his banking career from Corporation Bank in August 1976. He was also executive director of Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) at the time of the merger of Global Trust Bank with OBC. He also represented the banking industry as chairman of the Indian Banks Association.
 
 Incidentally, Mallya graduated from the Karnataka Regional Engineering College — the same institute where former ICICI Bank MD and Chairman K V Kamath had graduated, though in different years.
