AGRA: The inspector general of police (IG) of Agra zone,  , has ordered an inquiry into the   levelled by constable   in a video posted on social media on Saturday.
 
  Pandey told TOI that the allegations of harassment and corruption in the force levelled by the constable were serious and if found true, action would be taken against those responsible.
  
  “I have asked the chief of the department for the district concerned to inquire into the matter and submit a report,” Pandey said. However, he also raised doubts over the constable’s conduct, saying he had been suspended thrice and punished four times since joining the force, a fact that Chaudhary has admitted to in his video. However, Chaudhary had termed these suspensions wrong and had claimed that he had been victimised.
  
  Pandey said the inquiry would also ascertain if the constable had followed the prescribed procedures to raise his grievances or not. “If he uploaded the video without following the proper channels of communications, a departmental inquiry will be instituted against him,” the IG added.
  
  According to sources in the police department, the intelligence wing has also been asked to look into the constable's conduct.
  
  Chaudhary, who is posted at Etah, had uploaded a video on social media on Saturday, alleging harassment faced by him and others at the hands of their seniors.
  
  In the video addressed to the Prime Minister, Chaudhary said, “I am a constable of the 2011 batch and have been transferred five times, besides being suspended twice or thrice.” He also claimed that once he was asked by a clerk in the department for a bribe of Rs 5,000 for the release of his own pay slip. Chaudhary alleged that when he complained about the incident to the senior superintendent of police (SSP), instead of taking action against the guilty clerk, he was suspended.
