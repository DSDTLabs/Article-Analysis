DEHRADUN/NAINITAL/HARIDWAR: Amidst tight police security, the first day of the release of ‘Padmaavat’ passed by without any major protest or untoward incident being reported in  . Multiple security checks were put up by the police at the multiplexes in Dehradun which were screening the movie. “Heavy security force was deployed by us at multiplexes and malls on Thursday. Although we are confident that no violence will take place in subsequent days, we will not take any chances and a strict vigil will be maintained outside the cinema halls for the next couple of days as well,” said SSP Dehradun Nivedita Kukreti.

 
  
  Some of the cinegoers who watched the movie said they made it a point to book tickets for the first day’s show “to defy radical elements who are spreading violence unnecessarily.” I went to see the movie with my family and also urged my friends to do so. We should not bow down to threats from radical outfits who are propagating mindless violence,” said  , a resident of Haldwani.
  
  Another viewer in Haridwar who did not wish to be identified said that "it's inexplicable why there are protests against the film.” “Rajputs have in fact been glorified in the movie. I can’t understand why it is being opposed so vehemently. People must watch the film before protesting," she added.
  
  Although the day’s screenings passed off peacefully, a few sporadic incidents were reported from some places. In Rishikesh, a group of people took out a protest march but when police teams stopped them, the protest was called off.
  
  In Haridwar’s  , the lone multiplex screening the movie, no disruptions were reported. There was heavy deployment of police force outside all the four halls of the multiplex to ward off any trouble, police officials said.
  
  Haridwar SP City Mamta Vohra told TOI that tight security will be in place at the other multiplexes and single-screen where the movie will be screened from Friday.
