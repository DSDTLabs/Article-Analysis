KOLKATA: A day after a fire ravaged an illegal godown on the third floor of 37B AJC Bose Road, TOI visited a few neighbouring buildings on Thursday to find the virtually sitting on a powder keg. 

 
 With terraces stacked with tyres, residences converted into godowns for automobile spare parts and narrow alleys chock-a-block with vehicles and tyres dumped haphazardly, residents and shop owners had a close shave on Wednesday as a blaze ravaged an illegal godown on the top floor of a building. Though nobody was injured in the fire, it exposed the vulnerability of this pocket to big fires. 
 
 Sixty-year-old Madan Gupta, who owns a automobile spare parts shop in the same building where the fire broke out, broke into cold sweat thinking how the flames threatened to spread to his apartment in the neighbouring building. "For a moment I thought my house will be on fire too. I rushed to ask my family members to leave the building," said Gupta.
 
 "Authorities have paid no attention to how things have spun out of control here.   have mushroomed in residential buildings where inflammable articles are stocked. At some places, there is not even a few feet of space between two buildings. A big part is inaccessible by road due to encroachment making it impossible for a fire engine to navigate its way," said  , a local resident. 
 
 Iftekhar is not alone. Hundreds of families in   live in fear of being trapped in a fire because the commercial establishments that operate out of their buildings do not have any firefighting arrangements.
 
 "There are godowns in several buildings, making the residents vulnerable. Things like tyres and petroleum products are stocked in many of these godowns. None of these places comply with any fire-fighting guidelines. If any of the buildings catches fire, tenders will have a tough time accessing the spot through the clogged roads," said a senior fire department officer.
