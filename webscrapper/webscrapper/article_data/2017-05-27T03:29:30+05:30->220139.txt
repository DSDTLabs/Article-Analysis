The   government has formed a   monitoring committee, comprising senior police officers and   (MPCB) officials, to crack the whip on noise pollution during festivals.

 The move is expected to address citizens’ complaints about noisy celebrations that involve huge loudspeakers. State   officials confirmed the development on Friday.
 
 An official from the department said the Bombay high court, in a recent order, had issued directions mandating all police officers to ensure that the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000, are followed in the silence zones in their respective jurisdictions. “To implement the norms in the state, a noise pollution monitoring committee has been formed. The committee will be responsible for ensuring that the high court directions are being implemented in the state. It will keep a close watch on noise pollution norm violations during festivals,” the official added.
 
 In case of Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur, the committee will comprise the joint commissioner of police as president, a deputy commissioner of police and an MPCB regional officer as members.
 
 The monitoring committee will also have to ensure that citizens’ complaints registered through the helpline 100, WhatsApp, e-mail or teloephone are addressed immediately by the police. 
 
 Further, the monitoring committee will have to make sure that the police take cognizance of complaints using noise-level meters. In addition, the panel can approach the police superintendent concerned to take action against cops failing to act against violators.
