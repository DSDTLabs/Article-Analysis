NEW DELHI: India should focus its research to combat multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) strains and have an action plan to deal with antibiotic resistance on a “priority“ basis, a parliamentary panel has said in its report.

 India not only has the highest TB burden but is also the hub for multi-drug resistance.According to the Global TB Report-2016, India accounts for 24% of global TB cases. Six countries ­­ India, China, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Africa account for 60% of the global total. Nearly 480,000 contracted multidrug-resistant TB in 2015.
 
 The parliamentary committee on Demands for Grants for department of health research said   should take up a national-level sensitisation for the medical community on use of antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance is posing a major challenge in eliminating TB in India.
 
 “ICMR should focus its research on multi-drug-resistant TB strains with a view to discovering potent drug combinations combating MDR TB,“ the panel report said.
 
 It added though the government has rolled out the administration of   in six public health hospitals in India to specifically treat multi-drug-resistant TB, a lot remains to be done.
 
 While the committee asked the government to prepare an action plan on antimicrobial resistance and standardise protocol to administer antibiotics, the government has already started the process. Last week, the health ministry came out with a draft proposing various measures under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act to regulate prescription of antibiotics and keep a tab on AMR.
