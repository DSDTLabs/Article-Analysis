NEW DELHI:   their  , the former   on Monday told the   that even the   mandates a   by  .

 Resuming arguments before a bench of justices Sanjiv Khanna and Chander Shekhar, the former law makers also maintained that since they never received pecuniary benefits, the EC erred in bracketing their case with other office of profit cases where such gains were clearly made.
 
 “There was no communication to us (AAP MLAs) from the Election Commission (EC) about the hearing before it. It is in complete violation of natural justice,” senior advocate K V Viswanathan, appearing for some of the MLAs, contended, claiming that they were held guilty of holding OoP by the Election Commission without giving them an opportunity to explain their stand.
 
 The MLAs, all 20 of whom have now filed a plea in the high court against their disqualification, submitted before a bench that the poll panel had sent its opinion to President Ram Nath Kovind by “flouting the principles of natural justice”.
 
 The submissions on behalf of the MLAs came during the nearly day-to-day hearing that is currently on in HC on the legislators’ plea. 
 
 “It is also that even a temporary government employer cannot be removed on the grounds of misconduct without holding a full-fledged inquiry. However, in the present case, the members of the legislative assembly were removed without holding a full- fledged inquiry and without giving them any opportunity to explain if they ever held any office of profit,” the petitioners argued.
 
 HC had on January 24 refused to stay the Centre’s notification disqualifying the MLAs, but restrained the Commission from taking any “precipitate measures” such as announcing dates for bypolls to fill the vacancies. 
 
 The EC had recommended the disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs on January 19. The President had accepted the EC’s opinion the very next day.
