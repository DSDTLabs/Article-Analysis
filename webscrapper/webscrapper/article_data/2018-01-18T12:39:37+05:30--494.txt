HYDERABAD: Summer may be alittle far away, but the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) has put its summer action plan rolling to avoid interruption in water supply during May-June.

 As part of the summer action plan, water board officials have approached the irrigation department seeking its cooperation to maintain the water level at Nagarjunasagar reservoir not below 510 feet. Water would flow into Hyderabad by gravity if the level in the Nagarjunasagar reservoir is maintained above 510 feet at   village, from where the HMWS&SB draws water for supply in twin cities.
 
 The water board is currently supplying 268 million gallons of Krishna water to the city and peripheral areas.
 
 Last year, the board arranged an emergency pumping station at Puttamgandi after the water level in Nagarjunasagar touched the dead storage. As a result, the board dug up the Krishna river bed at Puttamgandi and drew water using motor pumps.
  
  
 “As of now the water level at Nagarjunasagar is satisfactory. There may not be any problem during summer. But keeping in view the last year’s experience, we have alerted the irrigation department to maintain water level at Nagarjunasagar above 510 feet. The water level on Wednesday stood at 533 feet,” a senior officials said.
 
 The board would require to install emergency pumps at Puttamgandi if the level in Nagarjunasagar reservoir goes down below 510 feet. To avoid any water shortage during summer, officials are making it sure that the level is maintained above 510 feet. Moreover, pumping water from the reservoir is a costly affair and it would further burden the board financially.
 
 
 Formal requests will be sent to the irrigation department in a couple of days, sources said.
