Bhopal: Toilet has become a point of tussle between former chief minister Digvijay Singh and the Madhya Pradesh government. Calling himself a “believer in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan”, Singh has asked for mobile toilets along the route of his Narmada Parikrama but the state government has allegedly kept him waiting. 

 The senior Congress leader has written to chief minister Chouhan, saying it is the duty of the state government to provide him with mobile toilets. “For Narmada Parikrama, I had written a letter on August 29, 2017, to provide security, ambulance and mobile toilets. I received a reply from deputy-secretary rank officer of chief secretary. They assured me to provide ambulances and security but not the mobile toilets,” Singh writes in the September 25 letter to the CM.
 
 Singh also mentioned that he had spoken to the collector and SP of Narsinghpur and Hoshangabad districts in this regard. “I have informed all the authorities concerned and officials about Narmada Parikrama. It is the responsibility of the state government to keep the Narmada clean,” he stated.
 
 Singh pointed out that thousands of people will gather during the Narmada Parikrama and it is necessary to arrange for toilets. “I believe in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Maintaining the cleanliness on the banks of Narmada is the responsibility of the state government and it should help me in achieving the same,” Singh says in the letter, cautioning that health and hygiene will be a concern when large crowds gather. “For this purpose, the government needs to support by providing mobile toilets,” he writes. 
 
 The 70-year-old is preparing to set off on the Narmada Parikrama on September 30. He plans to walk an average 20km a day to complete the 3,500km walkathon up and down the river’s lengthy course in six months.
