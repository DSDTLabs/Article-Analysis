HYDERABAD: Denizens are increasingly going in for genomic sequencing to detect any strains of cancer present in their genes. The 'liquid biopsy' test which is a blood and saliva analysis has nearly 700-800 takers in 2016, said experts. Such tests are available in major hospitals in the city and are priced between 18,000 - 20,000.
Genomic sequencing which can detect the predisposition to cancer, can be done for specific cancers. Once the test is done, specific measures like preventive medicines or surgery can be planned and executed. In fact, instances of   actress   like preventive surgery are too on the rise in the city.
 
  which is one of the most prevalent cancer among women is preventable with proper measures.However, knowing of one's genetic predisposition to the cancer can play a vital role. If a person is confirmed to be genetically predisposed to the cancer (through the liquid biopsy test), they are counselled and aggressive screening as well as preventive medicines are given. If the risk is assessed to be very high we suggest removal of one or both the breasts,â€œ said Dr   , consultant breast oncoplastic surgeon,   hospitals.
 
 Liquid biopsy detect traces of tumor DNA that released into the blood from dying cancer cells. While in case of hereditary cancer, genomic profiling can predict whether a person is susceptible to the disease or not, based on their family history and their individual risk for the disease.
