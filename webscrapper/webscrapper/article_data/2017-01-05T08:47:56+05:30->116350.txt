AHMEDABAD: Exactly 100 years ago, on January 5, 1917,   had entered public life and begun his political career after winning the   from   of Ahmedabad, defeating his closest rival by just one vote. His closest rival, barrister Gulam Narmawala challenged Sardar’s win and had sought a recounting. But it was of no use. The Dariapur ward elections were held after a sitting councillor, Saiyed Ahmedmiyan Sarfuddin, had died.

  From the day Sardar won the municipal polls, he never looked back. ‘The Boss’ as he was once called by Time magazine, went on to become the municipal president in February 9, 1924 and he held the post till April 13, 1928.
 
 “But what is more interesting is that Sardar was once asked by his uncle to apply for the post of Mukkadam or supervisor post at the Ahmedabad Municipality. Sardar had passed his matriculation late, and when he was already in his early 20s. This is when Gandhiji completed law and was returning to India,” says city-based historian Rizwan Kadri. 
 
 “Sardar turned down his uncle saying he wanted to pursue law like his elder brother and refused to apply for the post,” says Kadri.
 
  As a councillor, Sardar ushered in the concept of 33% reservation for women in the municipal council, began town planning schemes outside the Walled City, and strengthened the sanitation, health and municipal school departments. 
 
 AMC will celebrate this occasion at Gandhi Hall at the municipal corporation heritage building at 5.30 pm.
