JAIPUR: To protest against the ruling   on a host of issues, including the proposed release of Padmaavat, several organizations of three communities - Rajputs, Ravana Rajputs and Charan Rajputs-have decided to back the   in the byelections in two Lok Sabha and one assembly seats in Rajasthan.

 
 The decision was announced on Sunday at a press briefing at Shree Rajput Sabha Bhawan where over a dozen organisations representing the three communities were present.
 
 Polling for Ajmer and Alwar Lok Sabha and Mandalgarh assembly seats is scheduled on January 29, four days after the scheduled release of Padmaavat. Though the   government has banned its release in Rajasthan, the three communities want the film to be banned nationwide.
 
 The communities are also angry with the state government following the killing of two criminals, Anand Pal Singh and Chatur Singh Soda. Singh, a Ravana Rajput, was gunned down by police in June last year while Soda, a Rajput, was killed in 2016. While Ravana Rajputs and Charan Rajputs are OBCs, Rajputs have been demanding reservation for the economically poor of their community.
 
 The anti-BJP stance of these groups could be a headache for the ruling party in the bypolls, particularly in Ajmer where voters from the communities number around 1.5 lakh. Congress candidate for Ajmer, Raghu Sharma, was present at the briefing where community leaders alleged the government had worked against the three castes.
