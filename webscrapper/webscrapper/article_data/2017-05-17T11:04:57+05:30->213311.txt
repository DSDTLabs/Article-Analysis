AGRA: Demanding declaration of pending result of  , students began protesting for indefinite period outside Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar   secretariat on Tuesday. They raised slogans against university administration. However, no one from the university came out to hear their plea.
 
  The students were later dispersed by the police who asked them to either leave the campus or a case would be registered against them. Some of the female students reportedly fainted in the afternoon. Students said that they would soon launch a hunger strike in case the university administration does not declare the results.
  
  Around 7,000 B.Ed students of session 2013-14 are waiting for their results since last two years. A source said that some of the students of this session were enrolled by private colleges without counselling. Due to this, majority of the B.Ed results were not declared.
  
  “We refuse to give up. It is about our results. We are not demanding something unreasonable. University administration has been delaying the matter since last two years. We will go on hunger strike if our results are not declared,” one of the students said.
  
  University public relation officer   said, “Legal advice has been sought regarding B.Ed session 2013-14. Students were asked to wait till May 31, which they ignored. Eligible candidates will get their results soon. Candidature of those enrolled in violation of norms may get cancelled”.
