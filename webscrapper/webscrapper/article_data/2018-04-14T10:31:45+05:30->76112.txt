CHENNAI: Except for the one planned to come up near CMBT, four other subways planned by the state highways department are not likely to see the light of the day, according to officials from the department. However, the feasibility of foot over bridges at points that attract heavy traffic is being considered, they said. 

 Officials said feasibility studies suggested several hindrances due to proliferation of traffic and buildings in the areas where the subways were proposed. "For   and   subways, we had floated tenders. But the tenders did not find any takers despite being floated again," the official said.
 
 "It was difficult because there is no space for the work zone to be set up at these points. Also, no contractor would want to be involved in what seemed to them to be a loss-making venture," he added.
 
 The subways had been planned in 2013-14 at five points that witness heavy traffic - one near   in Little Mount, MKN Road junction in Guindy, Kasi Theatre, and  , and CMBT- and had accorded an administrative sanction of 19 crore. 
 
 However, the subway at CMBT will be constructed after the grade separator under construction in the area is over, the official added. "It will be 12m wide with space for vendors," the official said.
 
 Officials, however, say they are considering other means such as FOBs at the remaining four points. Transport experts, however, said the existing FOBs are not being used by people. Considering the ease of access and security of pedestrians, subways and FOBs both fail to be a good solution.
 
 "At-grade or magic boxes are better solutions," said Advait Jani of the ITDP.
