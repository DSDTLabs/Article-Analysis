KOLKATA: The   once again locked horns with the Centre over the proposal to close eight   that are “not commercially viable” and threatened to hit the streets if the proposal is not withdrawn.

 The state move comes despite a clarification from   on Friday night where it said that ‘they have no such intention to close any route’ and that the communication was only a routine ‘action taken report’ before every budget (that now includes the railway budget) as per directions of the  .
 
 “It is a political vendetta by the BJP. We will launch an agitation from February if the railways doesn’t withdraw the letter by January 31. How can they (Centre) take such a decision without discussing it with the state government? This is a central government project, why will the state pay? How can they say that these routes were not   and that they would be closed unless the state bears 50% of the cost involved?” Trinamool secretary general Partha Chatterjee said on Saturday. “They have already reduced the budget in 49 central government sponsored projects,” he added.
 
 The letter that reached chief secretary Moloy De’s office on Friday unleashed yet another battle ground between Mamata Banerjee and the Modi government. Reacting to this Banerjee had already said that this was a strong-arm tactic by the Centre to deprive the state.
 
 The railways was quick to react. “Earlier also such letters were sent and these are sent to other state governments too. The decision can only be taken by the Ministry of Railways, not by the Eastern Railway,” Eastern Railway said in a press statement.
 
 A senior official of Railway Board said, “The railways has no intention of shutting down any route.”
 
 However, he said some projects announced by Mamaat Banerjee when she was the railway minister, including the Deshpran-Nandigram link, Dankuni-Furfura Sharif, Bargachhia-Champadanga and Arambagh-Bowaichandi, may be shelved because of land issues.
