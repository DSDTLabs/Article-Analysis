HYDERABAD:   in the city are on a steep rise, with the first week of May alone recording as many as 52 incidents, show official records. This is excluding the fires reported from the peripheral areas of Hyderabad, statistics indicate.

 Hinting at a  , officials said that the cause of indoor fire accidents is primarily rooted in the heavy usage of electricity resulting in overload and short circuits while the trigger for outdoor mishaps range from open burning of garbage to improper discarding of cigarette butts — all aggravated by the shooting mercury levels.
 
 “During summer, the usage of electricity is much higher in comparison to other seasons. The added load often leads to short circuits that then result in fire accidents,” reiterated V Papaiah, regional fire officer (central region), adding, “The increasing temperature also makes dry grass or garbage, exposed to sun, flammable after it reaches a certain degree, and eventually results in fire accidents. This ignition temperature (at which a substance catches fire) is different for different material such as wood, oil, grass.”
 
 But often, outdoor fires are caused owing to human negligence, firemen said stressing how people have the habit of callously burning garbage and throwing burning cigarettes — both of which can result in fatal mishaps. “Especially during summer, if the fire is not extinguished properly, after a heap of garbage is burnt, it can spread rapidly,” said the fireman form the control room sharing a recent example of an accident caused due to such negligence.
 
 An incident was reported from from the Lakdi-ka-Pul flyover last month, when garbage dumped on the vacant land near it caught fire spreading panic among commuters. Fire tenders had bring the situation under control.
