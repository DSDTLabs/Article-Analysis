The team of   were in North Karnataka for a recce over the past week and have come away suitably impressed. The Rakshit Shetty-starrer, which will be the directorial debut of editor  , is a quirky cop film that is based in a vintage setting. “The story is set in a fictional town and needs a rustic terrain that is also dry. So what could be a better backdrop than the picturesque locales of North Karnataka?” asks Rakshit. 
The film’s team comprising Rakshit, Pushkara Mallikarjunaiah, DOP Karm Chawla, director Sachin and writers   and Anirudh Kodgi among others made the trip and toured across the historic towns of Hubballi, Kalburagi, Vijayapura, Davangere and Dharwad to freeze on the locations. 
 “In   we found the perfect setting for the film. With its ruins and majestic forts, it provided just the right ambience for the script,” shares Rakshit. 
 And when in North Karnataka, how can one miss out on its acclaimed offerings of food? “I’m a big fan of the native food of North Karnataka. So we visited some of their popular khanavalis and indulged in an array of local food and sweets. In fact, the owner of the hotel where we stayed in Basavakalyana went to great lengths to serve us hot kadak rottis and obbattu. I simply love the shenga chutney and curd combination and frequently get it even back home in Bengaluru. I also sampled bajjis with fried chillis and must say they’re rather delectable,” adds Rakshit. 
 The actor is also full of praise for the locals. “They’re an extremely simple and pleasant lot. Before Kirik Party, my movies hadn’t made a mark here. But   was a resounding success here too and when I came here I was pleasantly surprised to hear   being played in autos even today. I have come away with pleasant memories from my travels,” wraps Rakshit.
