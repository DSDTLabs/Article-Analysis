Kolkata/Burdwan: The shell of an   being boiled melting like plastic — this kitchen horror led to a Karaya homemaker lodging a complaint about ‘plastic’ eggs being sold across the city. On Friday, police and civic officials fanned out in different markets and seized eggs for laboratory tests to check their authenticity. 

 The Enforcement Branch of   also arrested trader Md   from Karaya for allegedly selling eggs with polymer shells. He has been remanded in police custody for four days.
 
 Mayor Sovan Chatterjee and Kolkata Police commissioner Rajiv Kumar sent an unambiguous message to their officers: “Get to the bottom of the truth”. With eggs consumed by young and old in lakhs of homes, their concern was understandable.

 “We will continue the drive for some time,” Chatterjee said. 
 
 Apart from smaller markets, the anti-adulteration team seized eggs from the wholesale Koley Market (Dim Patti) on Friday. MMiC (health) Atin Ghosh said the team had also seized eggs from trucks that arrived from Andhra Pradesh. “If we find anything suspicious, we will seize the stocks and take action against the traders,” said Ghosh.
 
 EB officers are also investigating fresh cases reported from Kalna, Burdwan, on Friday.
