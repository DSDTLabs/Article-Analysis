 Trichy: Upset at the continuing silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on their 31-day-old protest at Jantar Mantar, the farmers in Trichy took out a novel protest by submitting a petition to a man who lay motionless like a dead body at Manapparai on Thursday. 
 
 With the protest of the Ayyakannu-led farmers in New Delhi failing to move the Centre, farmers in the central district of the delta region expressed their helplessness in waiting for a response from the union government to their demand for Rs 40,000 crore drought relief. 
 
 At the protest at Chinthamani near Anna Statue in the city, the farmers led by Tamilaga Eri Aatrupaasana Vivasayigal Sangam president P Viswanathan got one among them to lie down as a dead body with garlands around his neck. The protesting farmers submitted a petition to the man seeking quick action to address the issues of the farmers in Tamil Nadu. 
 
 A similar protest was organised at Vaiyampatti where Desiya Thennindiya Nadhigal Inaippu Sangam carried out the protest. They dressed up a man like a dead body and made him sit with his jaw tied with a cloth. They carried him to the Vaiyampatti bus stand and sang Oppari. They also raised slogans slamming the Union government for keeping mum on the issue. 
 
 Ayyakannu and about 150 farmers have been protesting at Jantar Mantar for a month now to secure the drought relief fund. Their protest touched the peak on the 28th day when three farmers protested in nude in front of the prime ministerâ€™s office (PMO). On Friday, the protesting farmers in Delhi somersaulted on the road to draw the attention of the government.
