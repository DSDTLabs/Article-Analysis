GUWAHATI: Police are yet to recover stolen jewellery worth over Rs 1 crore looted from a city jewellery store on GS Road. Last year, police nabbed the culprits involved in the robbery. 

 Official figures revealed that police have managed to recover 19% of the total value of properties stolen over the last couple of years. "Last year, properties worth Rs 95.6 crore were stolen out of which police could recover property worth around Rs 20.1 crore," said a source in the CID. Out of the total cases, there were over 14,900 cases of theft and 2,400 cases of burglary or dacoity. 
 
 According to statistics, the trend was similar in previous years too. In 2014, properties worth Rs 48.1 crore were stolen out of which police could recover properties worth Rs 11.5 crore worth only. In 2015, police recovered properties worth around Rs 11.1 crore out of total 81.7 crores stolen. Likewise, out of stolen properties worth Rs 94.2, police had recovered properties worth around Rs 19.5 crore in 2016.
 
 A a senior police official said, "The prime reason for the low detection rate in theft cases is that the complainant does not know who the culprits are. In majority of the cases, the culprits have managed to conceal their identities from CCTV cameras making things more difficult for police. It is after a long investigation, tip-offs from informers, keeping a check on criminals involved in property offences and various other probe methods that police manage to nab the culprits."
 
 Sources said police hand over stolen articles worth several lakhs to complainants every year. 
 
 Last week, chief minister   asked police to improve its image and expedite investigation to protect people's life and property. "  have to work as a symbol of honesty, integrity, courage and humanity to win the confidence of people. Ensuring safety and security of people and their property is their main responsibility," said Sonowal at a function in which 2305 constables were inducted in the force.
