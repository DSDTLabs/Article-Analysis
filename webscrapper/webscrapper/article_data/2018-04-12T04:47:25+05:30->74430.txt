NEW DELHI: Dubbing him a “fugitive”, a Delhi high court bench on Wednesday asked Nirav Modi’s lawyer to ask the absconding diamantaire to return to India.

 
 The directive by the bench of Justices S Muralidhar and I S Mehta came when the lawyer for Modi’s company,  , argued that relief should not be denied to it on a technicality, as cited by the   (ED). “If we should not stress upon technicality, then ask Mr Modi to come back. Ask him to return,” the bench told advocate Vijay Aggarwal.
 
 The bench also expressed “serious concern” over the elusive businessman’s statement to investigation agencies that he will not submit to their jurisdiction. “We are dealing with a fugitive here, according to them (ED). A fugitive from justice stands on a different footing,”   reminded the lawyer.
 
 The lawyer said only nonbailable warrants (NBWs) have been issued against him and there is no order proclaiming him as an absconder.
