Pune: Traffic police constable Natharam Kale’s hand fractured on Friday night after an unidentified motorcyclist hit him at Indrayaninagar in Bhosari during a drive against drunk drivers.

 The motorcycle rider fled leaving behind his vehicle after hitting Kale. A hunt is on to track him.
 
 Kale (30) is posted with the Bhosari traffic division.
 
 The unidentified motorcycle rider was driving at a high speed. Kale made an attempt to stop him around 10pm at the naka-bandi spot.
 
 The case investigating officer, B D Kedar of the MIDC Bhosari police, said four constables were executing the naka-bandi operation. The motorcycle rider was heading towards Pimpri from Bhosari on a high speed.
 
 After spotting the motorcyclist, Kale waived at him to slow down. Kedar said instead of slowing down, the motorcycle rider increased the bike’s speed.
 
 When Kale went to the road to stop the motorcycle rider, the motorcyclist collided against Kale on a high speed. “Kale suffered two fractures in his hand,” Kedar said.
 
 “After colliding against the constable, the motorcycle rider left behind his bike and ran away. We have seized the motorcycle,” he said.
 
 As Kale fell on the road, the other constables rushed towards him. Taking advantage of the situation, the motorcycle rider managed to flee.
