JALPAIGURI:
  A holiday in the forests of north Bengal turned nightmare for 36 tourists from Kolkata when an inebriated policeman in uniform with his cronies in tow landed at the resort and abused the guests in the early hours on Thursday. The prime accused, an ASI, has been suspended. 

 According to the holidayers who were staying at a private resort in  , the ASI, a civic volunteer, their driver and another man barged in well past midnight, kicked on doors and abused them in the filthiest language. 
 
 Incensed, the boarders confronted the four and held them for three hours. Since they did not have the phone numbers of the local police station, one of them dialled Lalbazar and  . The call yielded result, with Kranti police outpost OC Kesang   rushing to the spot and apologising for the misdeeds. While ASI Gopal Chandra Roy was indefinitely suspended, Jalpaiguri SP Amitava Maiti said the civic volunteer had also been identified. 
 
 “I was shocked to see a cop creating chaos. He was completely drunk. When they could not find the manager, the ASI started abusing us,” said   resident  , one of the tourists. 
 
 The Lataguri Resort Owners’ Welfare Association has demanded stringent action against the accused.
