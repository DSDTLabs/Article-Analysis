It was a set of friends, family and closest people from the industry who were present and what was pleasing was the fact that there was no extra crowd or chaos at the soiree held at Palace Grounds. Spotted at the event were veteran actors like Bharathi, Shivaram, Girija Lokesh and Ramakrishna among others. Sandalwood star   made a quick appearance. Meghana’s MMCH co-stars   and   were present with their mothers — actresses   and Vinaya Prasad. Actor and filmmaker   had a special moment as he got to introduce his son, who is just around a month old now, to everyone at his best friend’s wedding. One of the most pleasant sights at the wedding was that of seeing veteran actress Jayanthi, who has been recovering from health complications lately. While she was still being wheeled around in a chair, her infectious smile had all of the industry folks delighted, and putting a rest to all those nasty rumours surrounding her health. The guests were treated to a carefully curated lunch that included North and South Indian fare, along with some quirky fusion dishes too.
