LUCKNOW: Aligarh Muslim University students’ union (AMUSU) stands divided over the issue of support to   in the coming elections. A section of office-bearers led by vice-president called an emegency meeting of the executive committe on Friday and rejected the announcement made on Thursday by the president and the secretary to support the BSP. 

 Made up of 13 members, AMUSU comprises the president, vice-president, secretary and ten other cabinet members. The executive committee meeting was not attended the president   and secretary  . Led by vice-president Nadeem Ansari, the other cabinet members, while rejecting the call to support BSP, said that in the history of AMU, the students union has never endorsed any political party for the elections, although individuals are free to support whichever party they like. 
 
 Ansari has also called the general body meeting (GBM) on Monday to seek resignation of the president. “As a union, we have not supported any political party and are only spreading the word against BJP and communal forces,” Ansari told TOI.
 
 The dispute started on Thursday evening when Hasan and Usmani announced support for BSP and later issued a press release on AMUSU’s letterhead accusing SP of not fulfilling any promises made to Muslims after coming to power. In retaliation, Ansari, along with support from five cabinet members, condemned Hasan’s move and issued a press release on the AMUSU letterhead declaring it to against AMU’s tradition and demaning Hasan’s resignation. 
 
 However, AMUSU president Faizul Hasan said that he would go ahead with his plan. Claiming support of common students, he said that he is meeting senior BSP leaders on February 12 in Lucknow after which a campaign in favour of the BSP would be launched on the campus and in other parts of the state. He also said that he would join BSP formally after completing his tenure as AMUSU president.
