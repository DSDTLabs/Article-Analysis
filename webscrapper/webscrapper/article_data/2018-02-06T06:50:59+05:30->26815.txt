NEW DELHI: The government has said that it has proposed to impose long-term capital gains tax on stocks and   (MFs) from April, as the current regime was “inherently biased against manufacturing and encouraged diversion of investment to financial assets”.

 “It has also led to significant erosion in the tax base resulting in revenue loss. The problem has been further compounded by abusive tax arbitrage opportunities created by these exemptions,” the finance ministry said in a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), released late Sunday evening.
 
 The move came days after the   proposed to reintroduce a “concessional” 10% levy for stocks and equity oriented MFs, while setting January 31 value as the benchmark and exempting gains of up to Rs 1 lakh from the scope of the tax.
 
 The finance ministry clarified the   would be covered by   tax and for them too, the new levy will come into effect from April 1.
 
 Besides, the FAQs gave detailed scenarios explaining how the tax will be levied, given multiple queries over how the gains will be calculated. “The cost of acquisition for the long-term capital asset acquired on or before January 31, 2018 will be the actual cost.
 
 However, if the actual cost is less than the fair market value of such asset as on January 31, 2018, the fair market value will be deemed to be the cost of acquisition. Further, if the full value of consideration on transfer is less than the fair market value, then such full value of consideration or the actual cost, whichever is higher, will be deemed to be the cost of acquisition,” it said.
 
 For instance, if a share was acquired on January 1, 2017 at Rs 100 and its market value rose to Rs 200 on January 31, 2018, before being sold for Rs 250 on April 1, the gain will be estimated at Rs 50 and a 10% tax will be levied on this. In contrast, if the share is sold at Rs 150 on April 1, 2018, the gain will be estimated at zero since the actual cost of acquisition is less than the fair market value as on January 31, 2018.
 
 In this case the sale value is also less than the market value.
 
 The tax department also clarified that if an equity share was acquired on January 1, 2017 at Rs 100, and its fair market value dropped to Rs 50 on January 31, 2018 before it was sold for Rs 150 on April 1, 2018, the acquisition cost will be the basis to calculate the capital gains, which will be Rs 50.
 
 In cases where the share was acquired for Rs 100 on January 1, 2017 and its market value rose to Rs 200 on January 31 but drops to Rs 50 on April 1, 2018 the acquisition cost will be taken as the benchmark and this will result in a situation where there is capital loss.
