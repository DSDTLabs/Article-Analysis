KOLKATA: A 16-year-old   was accidentally shot in his stomach by a shopowner in the Rajabagan area on Wednesday night. 

 The victim, Shakil Gazi, was admitted to   hospital in a critical condition. Gazi, a port area resident, underwent a surgery and the bullet was removed.
 
 The accused shopowner has been identified as Yousuf Khan. "He was arrested after we carried out multiple raids in the port area on Thursday. A case under section 307 of IPC (attempt to murder) and sections 25 and 27 of Arms Act has been registered against him at the Rajabagan police station," said DC (Port) Waquas Raja.
 
 According to police, Gazi had dropped out of school and used to collect scraps and sell them to different dealers in Rajabagan; one of them was Khan.
 
 Police said that on Wednesday night, Gazi was at Khan's shop. The shopowner recounted to other ragpickers that he had bought a new one-shutter gun. "Later, to show how it works, he fired a bullet and it accidentally hit Gazi," said a senior investigating officer.
 
 "The weapon has been seized and we are trying to figure out whether Khan has a criminal record or not and why he acquired the gun," said the officer.
