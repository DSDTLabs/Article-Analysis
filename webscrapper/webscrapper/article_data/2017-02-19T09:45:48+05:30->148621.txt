AHMEDABAD: Subhash Brahmbhatt, principal of  , was removed as the chairman of   for   on Saturday. 

 The decision was taken after the controversy of PhD exam for Indian Culture subject, for which the admissions were not done till last month despite varsity instructions.
 
 The case dates back to July last year when Brahmbhatt, as the chairman of Board of Studies was asked to set the paper – general paper and the subjective paper for the entrance test for PhD. While the subjective paper was supposed to be comprising of 90 questions and span across 90 minutes, the one set by Brahmbhatt comprised of 45 questions in 45 minutes.
 
 Due to this, the varsity officials faced a lot of issues in declaring the results as there was a mismatch in the marks of general paper and the subjective paper. Consequently, all the five students who appeared for the exams passed the entrance test.
 
 Even as the university directed Brahmbhatt to admit these students, the same was not adhered to till January. M N Patel, vice-chancellor, Gujarat University, said “Since the university directives have not been adhered to, it is decided to expel Brahmbhatt from the post of the chairman of Board of Studies. A new person will be appointed to the post following which entrance exams would be conducted and admissions will be carried out.”
