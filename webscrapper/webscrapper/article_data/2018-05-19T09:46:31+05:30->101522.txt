CHANDIGARH: If you are an international student and wondering how to get admission in  , then you may need to consider a few things. For starters, your case would be considered by the university only when it is referred by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), or any ministry of the Government of India. But for this, you will have to meet the eligibility criteria of the course.

 Similarly, the NRI students need to produce test scores of SAT with permissible combination of subjects for undergraduate courses, and GRE or GMAT scores to take admission in post-graduate courses.
 
 For engineering institutions of the university, including UIET and Dr SSBUICET, the   will be conducted through Direct Admissions Students Abroad (DASA) for the 2018-19 session. The foreign students, who want to get admission in PhD courses, will have to get accreditation of a government body.
 
 All international students, including NRIs, will have to appear for common entrance test to get admission in PhD. However, if the candidates are not in India during the CET, then they are required to have at least band score 5 in IELTS or 60 in TOEFL and 150-154 in GRE or 600 in GMAT. Meanwhile, it is imperative for all the candidates to qualify the interview.
 
 “We are enhancing student exchange programmes with the foreign universities. The fee structure of Panjab University is already student-friendly but we are still trying to make it more student friendly. We are encouraging group study exchange programme and we have had students from   and Nottingham Trent University,” said dean of international students, Deepti Gupta.
 
 “10% seats over and above the total number of regular seats in each course are reserved for the NRI candidates. The NRI students will compete among themselves for the admissions and their inter-se merit will be based on their score of SAT-II, GRE, GMAT etc,” Deepti said.
