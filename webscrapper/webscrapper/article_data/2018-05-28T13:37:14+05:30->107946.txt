PATNA: East Central Railway (ECR) general manager L C Trivedi has launched an app, CSRS (complainant/suggestion/redressal system), for the engineering department of   division. The railway employees of the division, through this app, can lodge their complaints or send suggestions to the engineering department or seek redressal of their grievances within a stipulated time frame.

 
 Danapur is perhaps the first division to launch such an advanced system to maintain transparency in disposal of works related to maintenance of buildings and railway quarters, Trivedi told this newspaper on Sunday. The employees’ complaints through the app for repair or maintenance of railway quarters would be noticed within six hours, he said, adding the new system was a shift from manual to digital solution to employees’ complaints.
 
 Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Ranjan Prakash Thakur said employees had to visit the office of inspector of works (IOW) frequently to get their works done. “The old system was a time taking process and often caused harassment to the employees. Now, employees are required to send message on the app about the nature of work required at their quarters. They will get ‘OTP’ on their cellphones soon after registering complaints. The employees will give ‘OTP’ to the service provider only after completion of their work in the railway colony areas,” he said. 
 
 The DRM said the engineering department of the division has developed a new software which could record and generate complainants’ identities. A team of railway officials would also keep a close watch on the progress of maintenance works, he said.
 
 The DRM said about 5,000 employees were living in the railway quarters at   alone. Though this app is for all the railway employees of the division, at present it would serve only those employees who are living in the railway quarters at Khagaul, he said.
