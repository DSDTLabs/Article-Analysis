KOLHAPUR: Leader of   and minister in Devendra Fadnavis government   on Saturday slammed his party president and Member of Parliament Raju  . 

 While speaking to reporters Khot said, "I am being ridiculed on social media by some of our party workers. The MP should control this or else I know how to control them."
 
 Khot was referring to the workers openly criticising him for his reluctance to join the party's rally against the government demanding loan waiver for the farmers. Shetti had planned to take out a rally from Pune to Mumbai against the government.

Following Shetti's statement, Khot faced anger from his own party workers and messages against him were spread on social media. Shetti recently stated that Khot has lost the path and he will bring him back.
 
 Hinting that he may part ways from Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, Khot said, "I am not the one to walk on a path that is already set. I have come from grassroots and know how to take efforts. I can create my own path. However, I don't know what will happen in future."
 
 The feud between Shetti and Khot started ahead of recently held zilla parishad elections. Despite Shetti's order Khot didn't campaign for the party candidates.
 
 Moreover, Khot fielded his own son Sagar against the will of party boss Shetti. The loyalists of Shetti believe that Khot will be joining   (BJP). At present Khot is Member of Legislative Council (MLC) on the seat offered by the  .
