Kurukshetra: The members of Indian National Students Organisation—student wing of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD)—burned the effigy of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar outside the Kurukshetra civil hospital on Monday in protest against the four incidents of gang rape, in which two victims were killed recently.

 The INSO activists and students demanded the arrest of those who had committed such heinous crimes.
 
 They were protesting against the death of a Dalit girl of village in Kurukshetra district who was raped and found murdered at Jind. INSO senior vice-president Jaswinder Singh Khaira and convener of its women’s wing Manju Jakhar alleged that the ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ campaign run by Prime Minister Narendra Modi had proven to be completely unsuccessful in Haryana.
 
 “The state government has spent crores of rupees by organizing numerous programmes on this campaign but has not taken any concrete steps towards the protection of daughters in Haryana,” they alleged.
 
 Later, relatives and social activists organized a candle march in town to pay homage to the victim. Hundreds of protesters participated in the march, raising slogans for seeking justice for her. Meanwhile, Namrata Gaur, a member of the Haryana State Commission for Women also visited the family of the victim and assured help in the case. A cheque of Rs 4,17,500 was given to the victim’s family by Haryana minister for social justice and empowerment K K Bedi.
