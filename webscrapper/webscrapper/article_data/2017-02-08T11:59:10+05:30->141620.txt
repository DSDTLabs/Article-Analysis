BAREILLY: Cracking the whip on SP leaders indulging in anti-party activities, the local party cadre, led by Akhilesh loyalist  , has set up special teams in each constituency to track activities of such men.
 
  “We have made a special team in each constituency which would steadily track activities of partymen suspicious of acting against the party. We have got tip off from some regions on people perpetrating against the party. However, we will disclose names only after the elections and disciplinary action will be initiated against them,” said Sublesh Yadav.
  
  According to a highly placed source in the party, the leadership will most likely take action against former Aonla MLA Mahipal Singh Yadav for indulging in anti-party activities. The former MLA, who was earlier given ticket by former state president Shivpal Yadav was replaced by Sidharaj Singh, son of former two-time MP and MLA Kuwar Sarvaraj.
  
  A disgruntled Mahipal was in talk with Ittehad-e-Millat Council (IMC) for a ticket from Aonla after he was denied SP ticket, but talks failed in the final stage. A SP insider told TOI, “There have been confirmed reports that Mahipal is now helping BSP candidate from Aonla Agam Maurya. SP district leadership here is in the process of procuring a video footage to corroborate the alleged charges. Disciplinary action will be taken following it.”
