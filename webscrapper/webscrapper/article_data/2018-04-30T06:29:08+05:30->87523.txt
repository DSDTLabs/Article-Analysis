MUMBAI: The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), beset by scandals involving its leadership, has appointed Jayant Patil, a former state finance minister who enjoys a clean image, as party chief in Maharashtra. Patil, 56, a trusted aide of party president  , was elected unopposed as chief of the Maharashtra unit on Sunday. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik was elected vicepresident.

 
 Observers said after outgoing president   completed his tenure last month, Pawar was keen on a “clean face” and noncontroversial figure in view of the 2019 polls to Lok Sabha and subsequently, the state assembly. Several NCP leaders are currently under a cloud in graft cases. Former deputy CM  , under investigation for alleged involvement in the Maharashtra Sadan case, is in jail on money laundering charges. Tatkare and former deputy CM Ajit Pawar are being probed for alleged links to an irrigation expenditure scam. The ACB has recorded their statement, but it has not yet reached a conclusion on whether they were involved.
 
 Jayant Patil was finance minister during Congress-NCP rule from 1999 to 2008. After R R Patil quit following the 2008 terror attack, he was made home minister. He’s been the vanguard of the opposition to the Fadnavis regime. Tatkare proposed Patil’s candidature and leader of opposition Dhananjay Munde and senior legislator Shashikant Shinde endorsed it.
 
 Former speaker Dilip Walse-Patil and Shinde were also considered for the post, but Patil was seen to be a stronger contender. Patil who began his career as a legislator from Islampur in Sangli district in 1991 and remains undefeated in assembly polls, holds a record for presenting the state budget nine times consecutively.
 
 Patil’s first task as NCP chief will be to manage the campaign for the by-elections to   and Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha seats and the Palus-Kadegaon assembly constituency.
