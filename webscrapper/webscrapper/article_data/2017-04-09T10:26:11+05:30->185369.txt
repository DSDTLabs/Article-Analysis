LUCKNOW: After state urban development minister   flagged off 20 mobile   from Lucknow Municipal Corporation’ss head office on Saturday, city can expect to get 127 more water ATMs by   this year. The company providing the water ATMs, Decentrik Technologies Private Limited, will introduce mobile water ATMs in 10 other smart cities in the state by March 2018. After Lucknow, these machines would be introduced in Kanpur in the next 10 days, followed by Varanasi, Agra, Allahabad, Meerut, Aligarh and Moradabad. 

 While inaugurating the project Khanna said, “As these machines have to be ferried in a designated locality, a person should be deployed with every differently abled person to help them operate the machine.”
 
 People will be able to get 250ml of clean, chilled water by depositing as less as Rs 2 in the machine, in a recyclable paper glass. People also have the option of filling their water bottles by paying Rs 5. 
 
 To maintain the quality of water, the company has tied up with petroleum companies to install fixed water ATMs at select petrol pumps. The mobile ATMs can refill water from these fixed tanks after confirming their request with an OTP sent on their registered mobile numbers. Decentrik Technologies founder, Vineet Vats said, “As a tank can be refilled only allowed after the OTP is confirmed, it ensures that only potable water is available in the mobile ATMs. We plan to open about 1,000 water ATMs across UP by March 2018 and about 8,000 ATMs by 2019.”
 
 LMC has granted a No Objection Certificate for these ATMs at 20 loactions in the city which include Charbagh, Aminabad, King George’s Medical College premises, Alambagh, RTO, Collectorate, Phoenix Mall, Nahariya and Polytechnic crossing.
