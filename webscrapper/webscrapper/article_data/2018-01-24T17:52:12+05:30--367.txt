A screening of   will be held in the   High Court after the controversial film's director  , who is seeking the quashing of an FIR against the movie, agreed to it. 

  
  
 Bhansali's counsel, however, requested that adequate security measures should be put in place during screening of the film in the court. Acting on the plea, Justice   directed the government to ensure adequate security measures for the screening. During the last hearing, the court had ordered for arranging a screening of the film before arriving at any conclusion on the allegations that the movie distorts historical facts. 
 
 Bhansali's counsel   said that they were ready to arrange the screening of the film in the court. However, he expressed apprehension over the possibility of law and order disturbance. The court then directed the public prosecutor to arrange for adequate security. The public prosecutor sought time to arrange for security. 
 
 Mehta adjourned the hearing for the case till February 2. The court will then decide the date for the screening of the film. The case pertains to an FIR filed by two persons named   and   with Deedwana police in March last year, alleging that the film has distorted historical facts and hurt the image of queen Padmavati. 
 
 Challenging the FIR, Bhansali had moved the court to get it quashed. The high court had then stayed the FIR, but had allowed the investigation in the matter to continue. 
 
 The Supreme Court had earlier paved the way for the all- India release of 'Padmaavat' on January 25 and stayed notifications and orders issued by  , Rajasthan and   - all ruled by the BJP - prohibiting exhibition of the film in their states. The apex court had also restrained other states from issuing any such notification or orders banning the screening of the movie.
