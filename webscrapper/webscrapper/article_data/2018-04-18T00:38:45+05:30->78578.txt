NEW DELHI:   has blamed the   of  ,  , for   in the elections of the   (GB) of   calling it “politically motivated and with mala fide intention.”

 Sisodia, in a letter to Tyagi, has blamed him for delaying the constitution of the governing bodies of 28 Delhi government-funded colleges. He claims to having received complaints of interference of the VC office in the process of election of the chairman of the governing bodies.
 
 “I have been told that Payal Maggo, the joint dean of academics, and assistant registrar Pradeep Kumar have been repeatedly calling the principals of these 28 colleges and asking them to ensure that the Delhi government nominee does not become the chairman. The principals were asked to mobilise support for individuals from the university panel or DU nominees to become the chairman,” Sisodia wrote in his letter. He added that he did not take the issue forward as the allegations were unsubstantiated.
 
 However, a senior official of the administration on the condition of anonymity said, “It is Delhi government that is interfering in the elections. They are calling up principals and demanding that the GB only elect their nominees as chairpersons.”
 
 Satyawati College, which was due for an election for its GB chairperson on April 16, saw three of its 18-member body unable to attend the meeting. “Despite the GB meeting the quorum, the university started pressuring the college to postpone the meeting. Such directions from the university are completely illegal and in violation of the universities own statutes,” Sisodia said.
 
 However, principal of Satyawati College, Manjula Das, said, “The university did not send us any directions to postpone the meeting. A few members of the GB wanted it postponed. The meeting will now be held on April 23.”
