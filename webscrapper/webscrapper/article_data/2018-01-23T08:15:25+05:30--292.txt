When we asked her about the secret behind her weight loss, she told us, “I work out a lot now. I watch what I eat. I do indulge as I don’t want to deprive my body, but I don’t believe in binging. No more chhole bhature for me, I now order it for others and have a bite.”

 
 The actress was excited to be home and meet her friends and family. “Delhi has been home, no matter how much people talk about the smog here, I still love Delhi. Being a Miss India, my association with Delhi Times goes way back to 2007 and I would really like to thank Delhi Times for always supporting me.” She’ll be back in Delhi soon at one of the colleges here to talk to students on sexual harassment. “It doesn’t matter which background you come from or where you are working because it happens in every industry for women. But like   said in her speech that their time is up and it is our time now. I would say to every woman out there, just speak up, that is more important – it is the first step. Girls get scared when it is someone with authority doing this to them. Especially in the case of children, parents should tell their kids that they should not be scared, and if something is happening against their will, they should speak up,” said the actress who was Miss India International 2007.
