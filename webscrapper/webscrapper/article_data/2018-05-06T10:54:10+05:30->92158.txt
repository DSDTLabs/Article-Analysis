BENGALURU: A Twitter war is on in Karnataka between the Congress and BJP, with CM Siddaramaiah being the most vociferous.

 
 AICC president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday demanded answers from PM Modi over the BJP giving tickets to those allegedly involved in corruption, including Yeddyurappa. Rahul put out a video titled ‘Karnataka’s Most Wanted’ on his Twitter account.
 
 The video had photos of Modi and other BJP leaders with the party’s election candidates, including ex-ministers who have cases of corruption against them.
 
 “Dear Modi ji, You talk a lot. Problem is, your actions don’t match your words. Here’s a primer on your candidate selection in Karnataka,” he tweeted. “It plays like an episode of ‘Karnataka’s Most Wanted’,” he said, using the hashtag “#AnswerMaadiModi”.
 
 The video says, “Dear PM, Will you speak for 5 minutes on 8 tickets to the Reddy Brothers Gang? Making someone who has 23 cases of corruption, cheating, forgery, your CM candidate?”
 
 “When will you speak on your top 11 leaders facing graft cases?” the video says, carrying pictures of BJP leaders Sreeramulu, Somashekhara Reddy and Katta Subramanya Naidu among others.
 
 Soon after Modi referred to Siddaramaiah government as the ‘seedha rupaiya sarkar (cash upfront government) on May 3, the CM tweeted: “Dear PM, I am glad you have made corruption an issue in this election because that is your weakest point. You are making baseless allegations of corruption about our Govt.”
