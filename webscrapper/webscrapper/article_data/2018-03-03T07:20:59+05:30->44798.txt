PUNE: The   witnessed some dramatic moments and an emotional outpouring after developer D S   broke down in front of judge  , claiming that despite his willingness to repay the depositors’ dues, he was not being allowed to do anything.

 “All I want to do before I die is repay the depositors money,” a teary-eyed   said while standing with folded hands next to his lawyer. Over the past few days of his remand in police custody, the developer has grown a white beard and presented a depressed look as he went on to refer to his properties attached by the police, including the expensive vehicles impounded recently. He said disposal of these properties in time was needed for repaying the dues. 
 
 On a submission by his lawyer, DSK was allowed to say a few words as he walked out from the box for the accused towards the judge’s dais to make his appeal. However, a section of depositors, who also gathered around the dais, were not impressed by his emotional outpouring and told the judge that DSK was in the habit of creating such drama everytime he is pressed for dues. “There were times when he would hit himself with footwear, slap himself and even cry before us whenever we would ask for our dues in his office,” they said and insisted that he should not be shown pity.
