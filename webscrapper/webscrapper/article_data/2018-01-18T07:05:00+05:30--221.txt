Ludhiana: After the drama over alleged resignation of power minister Rana Gurjeet Singh intensified, it is likely that cabinet expansion too will take place soon. With eight MLAs of the ruling party from the district, once again the demand for a cabinet minister from Ludhiana is gathering pace, with MLA Rakesh Pandey among the front-runners. However, apart from Pandey — who has been a five-time MLA and a minister once — MLA Bharat Bhushan Ashu is another face who may be considered for the cabinet berth, given the patronage he enjoys among the high-ups.

 None of the MLAs spoke openly about being in the race for a ministerial post, and left it to the party high command. Speaking to TOI, Rakesh Pandey said: “My family is serving the party since two generations, but being loyal workers of the party, we have never demanded anything on our own, and now also, it is purely up to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and the top leadership — including PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar and others — to decide names for the next cabinet expansion. But yes, being one of the biggest districts in the state, and having sent eight ruling party MLAs to the state assembly, Ludhiana deserves a chance to have at least one minister to give the city residents their due.”
 
 Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Sanjay Talwar were unavailable for their comments, as they were away to Delhi to participate in a meeting.
