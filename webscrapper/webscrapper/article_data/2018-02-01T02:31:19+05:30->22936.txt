GURUGRAM: Residents of Nirvana   apartment in  , Sector 57, alleged that they have been living without occupation certificates for the last 8 years as Unitech has failed to issue them the same. They also accused ditrict town planner (DTP) of not pulling up the realtor despite its failure. A total of 2,500 residents live in the township.

 Residents said without an OC, they cannot get legal sewer and canal water connections, as a result of which they are forced to draw water from the bore well with an annual extraction reaching around 22 crore litres. They also said they are unable to insure their properties too.
 
 Residents were given possession of flats in 2010, and were supposed to get the OC then. “But between 2010 to 2017, nearly 15 towers emerged in Fresco and possession of nearly all of them was given to the inmates,” said  , general secretary,  . “Preparations are underway to give possession to the buyers of apartments in the 16th tower.” 
 
 Residents said all apartments were registered with the government. “There is litany of limitations that have occurred because of this. We have raised the issue with authorities from time to time, but there has been no breakthrough. If something untoward happens, we won’t get damages,”  , another resident added. 
 
 Residents also said while Unitech was giving all its commercial projects Occupation Certificates immediately, same to residential projects was unforthcoming.
 
 An DTPC official said Unitech’s licence had expired and it hadn’t renewed it for years. “Without license, they cannot seek OCs,” the official said. “Now they have paid some amount and DTPC has recommended head offices in Chandigarh to issue the OCs on special case-basis. The response is awaited from the Chandigarh offices.”
