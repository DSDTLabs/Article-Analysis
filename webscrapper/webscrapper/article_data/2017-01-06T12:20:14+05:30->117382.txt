DEHRADUN: The   has set up a disciplinary committee to gear up for possible dissidence ahead of announcement of party tickets for 2017 polls. The disciplinary committee will monitor activities of sulking leaders who fail to make the cut and take steps to keep them in the flock, state   said.
 
  The BJP is likely to announce the list of its candidates for 2017 elections on January 14 and the disciplinary committee has its task cut out. It will keep a tab on party workers who might get upset at not finding their names.
  
  Bhatt said that the committee would monitor the disgruntled leaders until the elections. Bhatt said, “The disciplinary committee will take feedback from the constituencies and will take action against any indiscipline committed by the party cadres and leaders.”
  
  “Anyone found indulging in any sort of anti-party activities during the campaign will be taken to task and will face strict action,” Bhatt said.
  
  The BJP has received over 600 applications from ticket seekers. The party has identified ‘trouble spots’ which have received a high number of applicants. The focus will also be on seats of 10 former   MLAs led by former CM   who had turned rebel in the state assembly and later joined the BJP.
  
  The seats that the BJP’s new joinees will be fielded from could lead to resentment among party cadres. The saffron party is preparing to avoid a situation where disgruntled leaders join the rival camp or fight as independents.
  
  A senior BJP leader on the condition of anonymity said, “A series of meetings have taken place to iron out differences among leaders but the real challenge now is to keep everyone in the party-fold during campaigning.”
