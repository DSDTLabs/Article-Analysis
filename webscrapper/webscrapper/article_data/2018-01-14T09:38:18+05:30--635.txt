SHIMLA: A woman health worker from   district, Geeta Verma, has figured in the   (WHO) calendar for 2018. 

 Hailing from Sapnot village in Mandi's Karsog tehsil, Verma has made it to the calendar for ensuring almost 100% coverage under   and   programme in her area of operation. Deployed at Shakardehra health sub-centre, in Jhanjeli block of Mandi district, Verma undertook the campaign of immunizing children in remote villages of Mandi. She travelled long distances every time any immunization campaign was launched at the grass-roots level.
 
 She walked and rode her motorcycle to remote corners to immunize children belonging to nomadic communities, sometimes trekking through treacherous terrain in September last year. 
 
 Chief minister   congratulated Verma for her achievements and said it was a matter of pride for the state that a woman health worker found mention in the WHO calendar. He said all the employees should have her kind of commitment towards their job and an impulse for serving people with dedication.
