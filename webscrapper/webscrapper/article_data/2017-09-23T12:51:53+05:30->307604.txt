MOHALI: Union minister of state for civil aviation   feels aviation has grown in India because the government has been able to unlock the “mass-service formula”. 

 Speak,ing Indian School of Business Leadership Summit here on Friday, he said frugal development was the way forward in the sector. Citing mass services, Sinha gave an example of telecom services. “They used to cost high in India earlier; now, India has the lowest telecom prices. Earlier, 1GB data would cost Rs 1,000, but now the same data costs Rs 11,” he said. 
 
 He said the cost of flying was cheapest in India. “When we think of development going forward, it is the trajectory we are thinking about. We have to make a transition from a low-income country to being a middle-income country. The good news is that some of our states, like Goa, Sikkim and  , are close to achieving these. We have examples within our country, but we have to find the right development trajectory that will enable our low-income states to transform into middle-income states,” said Sinha. 
 
 He said he believed in looking at the middle segment of the income pyramid and creating services for it. “Tomorrow is about transformation. The first generation built this country and laid its foundation, the second transformed it to this state, and now it is the third generation, our country’s youth, who will have to address certain key challenges and take our growth path to the next level. These challeneges are changed demographics and the working age population whose quality of life has to be improved; global warming, which can become a big problem in India; changes in agriculture patterns and shortage of natural resources; and the issue of urbanization with massive rural-to-urban movements,” he said.
