JAIPUR: Intensifying its campaign against   over fees hike by the schools, district   has burnt the effigies of chief minister Vasundhara Raje and education minister   at 16 places in Jaipur on Wednesday.

 Pratap Singh  , president of  , said that the movement will spread across the state until government drops the fees hike. “Congress got immense support from the general public which made the first day of our campaign 'Fees Gathao, Bacpan Bachao’ a grand success. If the government fail to regulate the fees our next step to held protest march outside the residence of all BJP ministers along with protest march outside errant schools,” said Khachariyawas.
 
 Upbeat over the slew of measures announced by the state education minister to check the fees rise, Khachariyawas said, “The government has taken measures only after Congress has raised the issue. They have allowed all major schools to increase the fees which the our party has exposed."
 
 Congress raised questions on the effectiveness of Rajasthan Private Fees act which empowers a committee of 10 members including 5 parents to fix the fees. “The composition of committee has no state members leaving it on the schools to increase the fees on the basis of their whims and fancies. State doesn’t have any role in act even if any school raise the fees by 50% as the act doesn’t have any upper cap. The power of state is only to see that committee has complied with the provisions of the act or not,” said Khachariyawas.
 
 The party also said that common man is bearing the brunt of Modi government’s ill feted policies like the all time high price of fuel. “The fees hike upto 30% by some schools has made the life of common man miserable. I challenge that fees hike is not all required as the personal disposable income of the common man has declined in the last four years. If the common man is not expecting any hike in their salaries why schools are increasing the fees,” said Khachariyawas.
