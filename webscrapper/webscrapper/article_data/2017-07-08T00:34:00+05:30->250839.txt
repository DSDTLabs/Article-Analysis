Panaji: Announced about three years ago, the project to set up an independent super-specialty block within the Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital campus at Bambolim has been delayed due to encroachment on the hospital land. The project plan was revised in April 2016, increasing the bed capacity from 300 to 500. Health minister Vishwajit Rane said he is pursing the project, but no progress has been made as the land earmarked for the project is encroached upon. There are plans to identify an alternate site if the issue is not sorted out by the end of this month, Rane said. “We removed some ten illegal structures, but 11 more are yet to be removed. The encroachers have gone to court. We hope to bring a closure to this issue by the end of this month end. We will find an alternate site if there is further delay in evicting encroachers,” Rane said.  Former chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar, in his 2016 budget, had made a budget provision of Rs 150 lakh for the project. The super specialty block was to be built with funding from the central government under the Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Seva Yojana, 2015. Subsequently, the state government received a sanction for Rs 150 crore from the Centre.  In 2016, the total revised estimate of the project stood at Rs 386.20 crore. Of this, the Centre was to contribute Rs 120 crore with the balance to be borne by the state government.  As many as 11 super specialities were planned to be set-up, including the existing super specialities and new verticals such as oncology, liver transplant and endocrinology. It was decided to shift the existing super specialties to the new block once it was ready, thus freeing space and beds for general patients.
