VIJAYAWADA: A natural water body spread across 6.42 acres is falling prey to encroachments and official apathy at  , a satellite village of   city. 

 Constructions in the name of development have already shaved off almost half an acre of the lake, which had been neglected by officials for decades. 
 
 The lake, near  , is now limited to six acres, according to officials. However, locals argue that actual area after the encroachments is much less than what officials claim.
 
 Village revenue officer M Amaleswar said the area of the lake according to records used to be 6.42 acres. However, locals allege that more than 1.5 acre has been lost to encroachments and roads. They also suspect roads are being laid to encroach upon the lake and help increase the value of nearby land.
 
 The encroachment started with the construction of a temple on the north side by reclaiming land. After the temple construction, a proposal was mooted by a few locals to build a community hall behind the temple. Though there is no place available behind the temple, the construction was done during the last government with political support.
 
 The community hall stands on reclaimed lake area. Now, officials have laid road on two sides of bunds in the lake for ‘developing’ greenery. When contacted, executive officer of Poranki panchayat, D  , said the ongoing works are intended for beautification of the lake. The works have been undertaken at a cost of Rs 12 lakh from mandal parishad. He said soil filling into the lake is to strengthen the bunds.
 
 Bapuji justified his argument saying the lake was filled with sewage from surrounding houses, and the water is of no use to anyone. The land filling in the pond will not be used as road, he said. He admitted that there has been around two to three metres land filling along the eastern and northern bunds.
