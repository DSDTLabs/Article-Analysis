GURUGRAM: The Haryana government issued   notices to 10   on Friday for advertising their   without getting registered under the Haryana Real Estate Regulation Act (H-Rera). The notices come as a breather for home buyers, who have been batting against what they call “a builder-oriented Act”. 

 According to officials in the interim body formed to implement   in the state, the developers have violated the Act by carrying advertisements between May 1 and June 3 for both new and existing projects, without registering these under the Act. “We issued the notices under Section 3 of the Act, which says a developer cannot advertise a project without registering it,” said chief town planner Dilbag Singh, a member of the interim body. A 15-day window has been given to defaulters to revert with responses.
 
 Regarding punishments for violations, Singh said as per Section 59 of the Act, the violations can lead to penalties up to 10% of project cost. 
 
 Confusion is rife about whether the clause of needing to register a property before advertising it pertained only to new projects, or if covered existing projects as well. In a seminar organised by Ficci in Delhi on May 4, senior officials like Madhya Pradesh Rera chairman Anthony de Sa and Dilbag Singh had said there’s no bar on marketing and advertising ongoing projects. Later, though, in a letter to NAREDCO (National Real Estate Development Council) on June 12, HUPA (ministry of Housing and urban poverty alleviation) clarified that even ongoing projects can’t advertise without registering. 
 
 “All projects are ready for registration under Rera by the July 31 deadline. The government itself is not ready. If they do, we’ll comply with all rules,” said R K Arora, MD, Supertech.
