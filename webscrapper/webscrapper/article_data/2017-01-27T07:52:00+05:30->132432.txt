GURUGRAM:   (MCG) has finally decided to start road repair work by February 15. And it has now set a new time limit — till June 30 — to repair all broken roads across Gurugram, having missed the first deadline of December 31. Civic authorities said the work schedule will be uploaded on the   so that residents can keep a track on progress of the repair work.

 “We are certain the road repair work will start by February 15 and we will finish it by June 30. The contract has already been awarded and the contractor has been asked to submit a schedule of work, which will be uploaded on our website so that residents know exactly where and when the repair work will be carried out in their area,” MCG commissioner V Umashankar told TOI on Thursday.
 
 Ever since the monsoon season abated,   have been citing one excuse or the other for not starting the repair work. A couple of days ago, state PWD minister Rao Narbir Singh, who is the local MLA, was caught on camera telling some residents, “nobody is dying because of the bad roads, have patience for another two to three months”. Some residents have also pointed out that if DLF can construct roads in the Cyber City area, “why can’t the MCG do the same?”.
