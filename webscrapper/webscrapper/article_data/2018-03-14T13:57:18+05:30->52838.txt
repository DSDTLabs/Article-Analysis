TRICHY: As many as 18 passengers on board a TNSTC bus sustained injuries after it lost control while entering   on Tuesday.

 The bus skid and came to halt after crashing into the pillar at the entrance of the college. All injured were rescued from the bus and were rushed to the hospital. While no one suffered grievous injures, they were let off after administering first aid. 
 
 The incident has created panic among people as this is the third such accident happening at the spot, in a span of 4 months, which has left a total of 50 passengers injured so far. 
 
 During the previous accidents, the buses lost control soon after entering the medical college premises and stopped after ramming into a building. A major disaster was averted as there was less crowd at the hospital, unlike on other days, which may have left many dead.
 
 The colourful paver blocks at the entrance is being blamed for buses losing control, as it turns slippery during rain. Mild drizzling on Tuesday had made the entrance slippery and same was the case in the previous two instances.
 
  medical college Dr   said that steps would be taken to replace the paver blocks with bitumen road if it was found to be reason for such accidents after consulting with concerned officials.
 
 She also added that the bus driver was found to be over speeding while entering the premises, according to onlookers and passengers. 
 
 Buses mostly enter the college right after cutting out of the Pudukkottai- Thanjavur highway without reducing the speed, which results in such accidents, she added.
