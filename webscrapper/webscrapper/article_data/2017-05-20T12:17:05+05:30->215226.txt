ALLAHABAD: What would happen if one found out that the   of a person's father, mother, grandparents, children, uncle or even the neighbours was the same i.e; January 1. 

 As bizarre as this sounds, for   of Jasra block of   it is a reality. Aadhaar cards of all residents of Kanjasa village mention their date of birth as January 1. The village, with a population of over 10,000, feels cheated as they had to wait for a long time to get an Aadhaar card. The error came to light when teachers of the local government primary school visited the village to register the Aadhaar card number of each student, as mandated by the state government to track   in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 
 
 
 The village head, Ram Dulari said, "We have been intimated about the wrong date of birth on   The error would be corrected and new Aadhaar cards would be issued to villagers soon."
