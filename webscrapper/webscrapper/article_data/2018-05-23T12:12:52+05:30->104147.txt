PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: In its reply to a question raised by   group leader Rahul Kalate in the general body meeting on Monday, regarding the number of   in Pimpri Chinchwad, the civic administration said that in the past two years, illegal constructions had increased by over 1.73 lakh in the twin cities. 

 It said there were 4.78 lakh houses out of which 3.13 lakh houses were regularized. There were 67,000 illegal constructions five years back. Between June 1, 2015 and April 30, 2018, the civic body razed over 2,300 illegal constructions. Police complaints were filed against 1,039 structures, while the civic administration spent Rs 1.66 crore to pull down illegal structures.
 
 The state government had issued a notification in October 2017 that all illegal constructions built till December 31, 2015, should be regularised. Accordingly, in November last year, the municipal corporation issued a directive that all illegal constructions in residential, commercial and industrial zones would be regularized on payment of compounding charges till April 30, 2018.
 
 However, such structures in buffer zone, red zone, blue lines of rivers and on hill slopes were not to be regularised. A total of 56 applications were received by the civic body till April 30. Restrictive conditions and compounding charges resulted in lower number of applications, but no construction was regularized by the civic administration.
 
 In the meantime, the standing committee has directed officials to demolish illegal constructions in all eight zones of the municipal limits. A central unit would be set up and the joint city engineer will coordinate the drive.
