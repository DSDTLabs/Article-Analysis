PATNA: Model-turned actor  , who rose to fame with his performance in popular daily soap ‘Uttaran’, will play the role of Anand Kumar’s brother Pranav Kumar in the upcoming film ‘Super 30’. The biopic, starring Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan, is based on the life of mathematician and   founder  .

 According to sources, Pranav has always been his right hand and biggest support, right from the days when Anand began his campaign to educate underprivileged students.
 
 Nandish is in touch with Pranav to get a real-life feel of his lifestyle, body language and love for violin. “We first met in Mumbai a couple of months ago. Now, the shooting is on. He will also come to Patna,” said Pranav.
 
 The shooting of the film has been done in Varanasi. Later, some parts will also be shot in Bihar. ‘Super 30’ will try to show how poverty and hardship compelled Anand to look for opportunities to first sustain himself and later inspired him to do something for others. His brother Pranav stood by him through thick and thin. The film is likely to be released next year in January.
