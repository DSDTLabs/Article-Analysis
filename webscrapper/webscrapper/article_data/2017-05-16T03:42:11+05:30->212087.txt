CHENNAI: Superstar   proved yet again on Monday that he is in no mood to end the suspense on whether he plans to enter politics, as has long been speculated.

 The actor’s possible political leap has been a subject of debates since 1996, when his call to “oust Jayalalithaa” resulted in the DMKTamil   combine sweeping the assembly election. With Jayalalithaa’s death in December last year, speculation began once again.
 
 When Rajini postponed a meet-up with fans last month, the suspense intensified.
 
 On Monday, he finally met fans, but the 16-minute speech he gave left them more confused than before about his plans. “My life is in the hands of God,” he said. “I am a mere tool.
 
 I serve as an actor today. Whatever role God gives me tomorrow I will stay true to that. I don’t know what that role is.”
 
 He added, however, that if he did enter politics, he would be “truthful and not entertain people who want to make money”. The 66-year-old star described his brief stint in politics two decades ago as a “political accident”.
