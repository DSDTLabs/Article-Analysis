PATNA: A lawyer on Thursday filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in Patna high court demanding high level probe into the breach in the Ganga pump   at Bateshwarsthan (Kahalgaon) in Bhagalpur district.

 The PIL, filed by high court advocate Manibhushan Pratap Sengar, has also demanded recovery of money from the guilty persons. The wall of the canal had collapsed during trial run on Tuesday, a day before the Rs 389.31-crore project was to be inaugurated by chief minister Nitish Kumar, and inundated areas of Kahalgaon. 
 
 “I have urged the court to ask the state government to conduct a high level probe into the breach and fix responsibility on the officials whose negligence led to flood-like situation in Kahalgaon,” Sengar said.
