TIRUPUR: Allegedly upset over his father’s drinking habit, a 14-year-old boy has committed suicide by hanging from the ceiling of his grandmother’s house at   at 15 Velampalayam here on Thursday.

 Preliminary investigations revealed that the deceased used to often complain to his friends that his father used to quarrel with the family members in an inebriated state.
 
 The deceased was identified as Hariharan, son of P Prakash and Devi couple from Arumaikarar Thottam at 15 Velampalayam. He was a Class IX student. His parents are daily wagers.
 
 According to the police, the boy was staying at his grandmother Chinthamani’s house, which was in the neighbourhood. He was found hanging from the ceiling of the house on Thursday morning.
 
 During the inquiry, his father said Hariharan, who had appeared for Class IX board exams, was doubtful about clearing all the papers and this might have forced him to take the extreme step.
 
 The police, however, suspect that the boy might have ended his life due to his father’s drug addiction. “We did not find any suicide note,” they said.
 
 The 15 Velampalayam police have registered a case and further investigations are on.
