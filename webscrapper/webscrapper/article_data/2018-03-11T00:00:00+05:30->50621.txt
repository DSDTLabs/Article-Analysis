 My bed in my bedroom. I sit on my bed with this beautiful view outside and watch the day go by. 

  As of now, I am dealing with a home project problem. My LED lights have been troubling me a lot. 
 
 I love this chandelier made with wooden beads. I bought it from the US. It was love at first sight. I had to go through a lot of trouble to import it. Every time I look at it, it makes me feel wonderful! 
 
  Green spaces are a must. I’m blessed to have big balconies and an open terrace where I’ve planted all kinds of greens. 
 
  I’m a simple person, so I like to keep things minimalistic and subtle. I also like to have different themes for each room. I love to keep my house warm and simple just like me, as your home is an extension of you.
 
  Everything in my house is me. I choose everything personally, as I have to live in it, not the designer. Though I am very open to ideas and suggestions, the last call has to be mine.
 
  I don’t like AC units to be spread everywhere, so we made some really cool-looking wooden cupboards to cover that and make it look like a showpiece. It looks better and saves space. Also, I love mirrors so I put a lot of mirrors in my house to make it look bigger, especially my walk-in wardrobe. 
 
  “It feels like home.” People feel welcomed in my house and are at ease. When they say that it’s like the best compliment ever. Because that’s how a home should be and it can only happen if you are a good host. 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Where my soul resides
 
  Simple, warm tones, something that can be changed easily and is not boring to look at every day. Mostly, it’s off white, beige, with a touch of deep red, purple, pinks and some blues.
 
  Green spaces, natural light, dark wood. I love to add plants everywhere. I also need good lighting, as we have to constantly take photos and shoot. The third – keep it simple; DO NOT clutter.
