AHMEDABAD: Last year, Vijay Parsana, the owner of a fitness chain, grabbed headlines when he organized a grand wedding for his Gir cow, Poonam. The partner he had chosen for her was Arjun, a bull from Kotiya village of   district. Parsana spared no expense for the bovine nuptials: the ceremony was elaborate and he spent lakhs to deck up the cow in a sari and gold jewellery. 

 Now, Parsana has planned another major function, scheduled for April 11, to welcome the first offspring of the cow, a calf he has named Saraswati. In the function, Poonam’s ‘in-laws’ from Bhavnagar will drop by with sweets to greet the newborn and Poonam and Saraswati will be worshipped.
 
 The event is taking place at a time when the central and state governments are vociferously supporting the protection of cow progeny and are formulating stringent laws against slaughter. The state government recently introduced harsher punishment for those involved in illegal cow trade and against those caught with beef. 
 
 For Parsana, the pomp and ceremony are about belief. “For me, Poonam is Kamdhenu (the cow that grants all wishes to the owner) and I had decided to celebrate her wedding,” he said. “Those who had attended the function know about all the things that could have gone wrong but somehow got sorted out. She has granted our wish for her to have a child and I have grown very fond of Saraswati.” The calf will turn one month old on Tuesday.
 
 Parsana said that the need of the hour is to cherish cows, irrespective of religion. “The event will highlight our association with cows,” he said. “My dream is to bring together persons from different nationalities and religions to experience the boons of cows first-hand.” 
 
 Skinning of dead animals had caused an atrocity in   last year when some dalit youths were flogged in Una. In another case, a youth had died after being chased by cow vigilantes in Ahmedabad.
