AHMEDABAD: Aggrieved at the caste-based discrimination in Hinduism and the approach of a government that rode to power on the Hindutva agenda, the parents of one of the victims of the 2012 Thangadh shooting incident have decided to renounce Hinduism and embrace Buddhism.

 Valji and  , the parents of 17-year-old Mehul, who was killed in police firing on September 23, 2012, said they will renounce the religion in which they were born as Dalits.   and his wife are likely to renounce Hinduism along with the Una flogging victims at Mota Samadhiyala near Una town on April 29.
 
 Balu Sarviaya, his two sons and two nephews — Ramesh, Vashram, Bechar and Ashok — who were beaten and paraded half naked by so called gau rakshaks (cow protectors) in Una, had decided to renounce Hinduism in January. The Sarvaiyas invited the Rathods to convert to Buddhism, which they agreed to.
 
 Valji Rathod said, “I started following Lord Buddha since 2014, when I felt there is no hearing for Dalits in the country if they follow Hinduism. I will officially change my religion along with the Una flogging victims.”
 
 Rathod has been demanding a copy of the Sanjay Prasad inquiry committee report for a long time. He and the kin of other victims sat on a fast in August 2016, but wound it up after getting an assurance from the government that a special investigation team (SIT) would be formed.
 
 Chandrika said, “I will also follow my husband’s path of renouncing Hinduism and embracing Buddhism.”
 
 Vashram Sarvaiya, one of the victims of the Una incident, said, “We invited many atrocity victims from across the state and the Thangadh victims’ families were among them. Embracing Buddhism will help the atrocity victims get rid of caste-based discrimination.”
