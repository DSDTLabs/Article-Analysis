PUNE: A   surfaced on January 5 after a 13-year-old orphan girl   at a  . 

 The Pimpri police arrested   (45), a Pimpri resident, for allegedly raping the girl. Pawar, a resident of Pandharpur in Solapur district, is a car driver.
 
 Sub-inspector Ratnamala Sawant said the girl lost her parents 10 years ago. She studied in a school located at Phaltan, Satara. But after passing her Standard VII examinations three years ago, her grandparents brought her to Pune. “They failed to support her education because of poverty,” Sawant said, adding that they ran a household mess.
 
 Pawar stayed on rent with the family and used to have evening meals with them. As he started interacting with the girl, he came to know that she was an orphan.
 
 After befriending the girl, Pawar allegedly raped her in March. “He made several promises to her and told her to keep quiet. He promised to buy her a home and that he would marry her off to a good man,” Sawant said.
 
 The girl did not inform her grandparents in the initial stages of her pregnancy. Few months later, the neighours and her grandparents came to know what had happened. “She was taken to a hospital in Pimpri. Upon inquiry of the identity of the father of the unborn child, she named a few boys from her neighbourhood, as instructed by Pawar. But when her grandparents persisted to know the truth, she narrated how she became pregnant,” Sawant said.
 
 After this, police filed a complaint against Pawar. “Her school documents prove that she is 13 years old,” Sawant said.
