NOIDA:  , the Muslim face of  , launched a scathing attack on prime minister   over the demonetisation move and mocked his “achhe din” slogan, while kicking off the party’s 2017 assembly election campaign in Noida on Tuesday.

 Addressing a public rally in the city, Siddiqui said, “Modiji promised achhe din ahead of Lok Sabha polls and also promised to bring back black money stashed abroad. Instead, he announced demonetisation on November 8 last year and made the honest stand in line for their own money. The PM will have to pay in 2017 polls for his cash ban move.”
 
 Criticising Modi for shedding tears at a public rally, the BSP national general secretary said, “The PM says he gave up his family for the country. But who asked him to do that. He needs to take a lesson from Mayawati who never raised a family and considers the nation as her family. If Mayawati comes to power, Modi will run away to Gujarat,” he said.
 
 Siddiqui also demanded to know that if Modi was a chaiwala (tea seller), how could he afford to spend Rs 80 crore on his clothes after he became the PM. “There is no special government fund for PM’s clothes,” he said.
 
 He also took a pot shot at home minister Rajnath Singh and his son Pankaj, who was declared as the BJP candidate from Noida constituency. 
 
 “While posters ahead of the 2014 polls announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh for his father who was never seen in his constituency, a reward of Rs 20 lakh will be announced for Pankaj,” the BSP functionary said.
 
 Taking on the ruling Samajwadi Party, Siddiqui claimed the “family feud” within the Yadav clan was a “planned drama” to cover up the shortcomings of chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. 
 
 “Akhilesh talks about garnering votes on the basis of work done by him, but where is the development,” he asked.
