NAGPUR: The   (MCI) conducted a surprise compliance inspection at the   ( ) on Monday to check whether the college meets the norms for 150 seats.

 The last inspection was carried out in October 2016 and a series of deficiencies were pointed out for beds, faculty, etc. The college was to comply at the earliest.
 
 But on Monday, the college authorities were caught off-guard. The three-member MCI-appointed inspectors team found a deficiency of 10.26% in the faculty. Generally, a deficiency of more than 10% is not allowed.
 
 The state government has not created post of three associate professors (APs) and six lecturers and, hence, the college couldn’t fill these posts. Also, three professors from the college are on deputation duty elsewhere, but the MCI inspectors refused to consider the issue as they said that it was not under their power to overlook this deficiency.
 
 Hence, the college will be required to send a letter to the MCI officials. At present, the college has 162 teachers.
 
 MCI inspectors also pointed out deficiency of air conditioners and not enough computers with Internet availability in the library. The library should ideally have about 40 seats but there are just 17-18 computers. The issue of demolition of class IV quarters and constructing new ones was also raised, but the college said that until the state government gives funds for demolition of existing ones, the new construction cannot start.
 
 The inspectors also demanded a common gymkhana as per MCI norms for staff and students which the college didn’t have.
