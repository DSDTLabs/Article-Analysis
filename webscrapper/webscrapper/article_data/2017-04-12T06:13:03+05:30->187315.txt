THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a major catch, the   police have seized banned currencies worth Rs 22.50 lakh on Monday. The police who acted on a tip off could not arrest the culprits as they escaped leaving behind an Innova car with stacks of currencies in it.

 Medical College CI   had received a tip off on exchange of demonetised currency notes. A team of police officials, led by CI, reached near   bridge at   on Monday night. “They seemed to have gotten information about us and so they escaped leaving the Innova and the money,” the CI said.
 
 The police found banned currency notes of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500, which ceased to be legal tenders following demonetisation announced on November 8 last year, and three mobile phones without SIMs in the Innova car. Police got leads into the culprits based on details of a vehicle with registration number KL-01 BF 7776.
 
 Binu Kumar said that they would submit the seized currency and mobile to court the next day. “All details will be handed over to enforcement directorate after that. Enforcement directorate is responsible for investigations on cases related to seizure of banned currencies. We will also conduct another investigation,” he said.
