HYDERABAD: With cheques distribution for farmers under the investment support scheme to take off from May 10, IT and municipal minister   said it is inevitable that other states too adopt it for the benefit of farmers. "There is going to be another green revolution in the country which is beginning from Telangana," he said adding how the 8,000 per acre per year would radically change agricultural practices. 

 
 "Chief minister   has brought about a revolution in governance," KT Rama Rao said at a function held in   where many leaders and people joined the TRS from Warangal.
 
 "Brace up for more verbal attacks from the  . What the government is doing for the farmers has become intolerable for them. They neither did anything for farmers nor want anything done," he said.
 
 The minister described the Congress as a 'Raabandhu' (vulture) and the TRS as a 'bandhu' (relative) of farmers. He elaborated how Telangana remained backward in the united AP. "No other state gives 24 hours power supply to all sectors," he said.
 
 After the   was explained to Union home minister Rajnath Singh he enquired about the repayment. "When he was informed that farmers do not have to repay any amount, he was taken aback. We told him that is the kind of interest Telangana government takes in the welfare of farmers," KTR said.
 
 For being critical about the TRS government and the CM, the minister said the fears of Congressmen had been exposed, that all the work done by the government was making the Congress irrelevant. "Unlike the Congress which has bosses in New Delhi and have to take their permission for everything, our bosses are people who are in our gullies (lanes). We are accountable to the people," he said.
