CHANDIGARH: The number of babies born through the caesarean procedure went up by 8% in Punjab in the past 10 years.

 The trend has caught up in  , but has taken a dip in case of government set-ups.
 
 According to   2015-16 (NFHS-4), caesarean cases in the state rose from 16.5% in 2005-06 to 24.6% 2016-17. This figure has increased from 31.5% to 39.7% at private health facilities, but has fallen at   from 34.3% to 17.8%.
 
 A gynaecologist at a government hospital, who did not wish to be named, said the number was high for private hospitals because of complications and parents wanting the child to be born on a specific date. “Even otherwise, there is a growing tendency among private practitioners to have caesarean instead of normal deliveries,” she said.
 
 A caesarean, or C-section, delivery usually takes 45 minutes to an hour.
