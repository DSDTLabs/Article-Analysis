KOLKATA: It was a visual display of power till now. But the show is all set to get an auditory touch.

 With   banned for all and the blue ones becoming ‘janta class’ after the omission of a clause in the Central Motor Vehicles Rule (CMVR),   are bringing back sirens and hooters to keep the   alive. Once in use, they are all set to make Kolkata, the noise capital, noisier.
 
 “So, far it was visual demonstration of political power. Now, it will wreck your nerve,” said a transport department officer. “Blue   can no more distinguish a VIP vehicle from that of a common man. Therefore, the hooter remains the only saving grace for the privileged class,” added a police officer.
 
 “Already, we have found a large number of VIP vehicles fitted with hooters. Now-a-days, thanks to various controversies, the use of hooters is limited. But they will be in full blare once the dust settles,” said a traffic police officer. Section 119 of the CMVR prohibits use of high noise and delegated the state government’s registering authority with the power to curb it.
 
 Section 294 of the West Bengal Motor Vehicles Act empowers the Kolkata Police commissioner and the district magistrate to restrict the use of siren. The sub-rule 3 says that no vehicle, except those of the police department being used as pilot cars for escorting vehicles of high dignitaries like governor or chief minister, are eligible for use of sirens.
 
 The use of siren will be more audible in the districts than in the city. A lot of MLAs, who have hitherto used the red beacon, will now be using hooter. “In reality, we have very limited power. Vehicle fitted with beacon was the only privilege we enjoyed. Even that has been robbed. It helped us to cover a long distance in the shortest possible time,” said a Hooghly MLA. “I am happy that siren can salvage some of my prestige,” he added.
