NAVI MUMBAI: A 22-year-old   cadet from Revdanda, Raigad district has become the latest victim of an e-fraud. The victim, Chandraprakash Suroliya, was in Andaman and Nicobar Islands with friends last week when a man posed as a bank representative and fraudulently obtained his bank account and debit card details. The fraudster then carried out an online purchase worth Rs 47,994, using his card details.

 Both Port Blair and Revdanda police stations refused to register his complaint by claiming that the crime did not happen in their jurisdictions. He then approached the Alibaug police headquarters after which an FIR was finally registered on Wednesday.
 
  The complainant claimed that on January 13, while he was in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, he received a call on his mobile around 3.15 pm. The caller claimed that he was a representative of State Bank of India and his form for opening a bank account has been rejected. 
 
 The caller then sought details of his other private bank account and debit card details such as 16-digit card number, CVV number and PIN. Soon, the youth received a mobile text alert stating that Rs 47,994 was debited from his account. He then blocked his debit card and informed the bank customer care.
