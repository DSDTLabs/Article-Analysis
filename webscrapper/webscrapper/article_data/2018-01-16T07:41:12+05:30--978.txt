NEW DELHI: Mainstreaming of children with   as a tool is the new strategy of the Centre to “bring back normalcy” in Jammu & Kashmir.

 The human resource development ministry has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the department of school education of J&K government as part of measures which include exchange of 9,000-10,000 students between the state and the rest of the country to share experiences. It also envisages setting up of Information and Communication technology (ICT) and digital platforms in the schools of the state. The initiative will start from January 18 and the first batch of students from J&K will also get to witness the Republic Day celebrations in Delhi.
 
 The MoU for ‘School Education Transformation Roadmap’, a joint study of the Centre and the state government, was announced on the first day of the two-day meeting of the Cabinet Advisory Board of Education (CABE) here.
 
 Briefing the media, Anil Swarup, secretary (school education and literacy) in the ministry said the government is engaging with the state to mainstream children and “we have travelled some distance in this”.
 
 “This (the student exchange) is not a one-time exercise. The other initiative is to set ICT and digital technology in the schools of J&K. For that we will also use solar energy platforms,” he said.
 
 HRD minister Prakash Javadekar and J&K school education minister Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari were present.
