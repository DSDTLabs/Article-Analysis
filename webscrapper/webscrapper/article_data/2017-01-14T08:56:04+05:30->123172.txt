COIMBATORE: In yet another open defiance of the Supreme Court’s ban on jallikattu and all sports involving animals, a group of bull owners conducted a rekla rehearsal near   here on Friday morning. The event had almost 15 bullock carts participating in the race and an audience of 200 people. The group insisted on conducting a proper event on the day after Pongal.

 At 9am on Friday, almost 200 people, including local residents, bullock cart owners,   enthusiasts and jallikattu activists gathered on Ettimadai by-pass roadside. Hardly half-an-hour later, almost 15 carts with Kangeyam bulls were ready for the race on main road. “The bullock carts raced side-by-side to Chavadi,   and then again on the Ettimadai by-pass road,” said  , one of the organisers. He owns a rekla horse and bullock cart. “It was a 3km long distance,” he said, adding, “The police unofficially agreed not to stop us as long as we did not create problems.”
 
 The rekla bull owners said they decided to go ahead with the event as they had waited enough for the   and governments to lend them an ear. “We staged several protests and sent many petitions to draw a decision in favour of us but in vain. Since everyone across the state were conducting these events, we decided to conduct it. So, we gathered local residents and 60 rekla bull owners came together and conducted it,” Krishnakumar said.
 
 The organisers said they have plans to conduct a full-fledged rekla race as per traditions at the Mala Temple at Velandhavalam the day after Pongal. “As per tradition, we usually take statues of our bulls and pray for their good health at the temple. It is followed by the rekla race. We plan to go ahead and conduct it as per customs this year,” Krishnakumar said.
