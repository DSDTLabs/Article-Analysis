CHANDIGARH: The   police on Wednesday booked Dadri   Rajdeep Phogat and 49 others, including Youth INLD activists, for protesting over garbage disposal issue. The INLD MLA on Wednesday morning led a protest against the civic body and the local administration for not shifting the town's garbage dumping ground to the outskirts. 

 The protesters initially entered the dumping ground and forcibly loaded tractor-trailers and carts with garbage and threw it outside the residence of deputy commissioner Ajay  . 
 
 The protesters also raised slogans outside the DC's residence. They blocked the roads, scattered the garbage and did not allow Tomar and his staff to move.
 
 Taking strong cognizance of the incident, the police registered to cases at   City police station. "We have registered two separate cases. One has been registered for unlawful assembly, blocking the roads and causing obstruction in the discharge of official duty by the government employees. The second case of trespass and intimidation has been registered for forced entry into the dumping ground. Both the cases are registered on the complaint of the secretary of the Dadri municipal council," said Dadri superintendent of police  .
 
 "Investigations are in progress and we are verifying the facts. Accordingly, further action will be taken," Garg added.
 
 When contacted, Phogat termed the registration of cases as vendetta politics by the BJP government in Haryana. "Instead of registering the case or mounting pressure, the administration should have taken proactive steps in shifting the dumping ground. We had to raise the public voice and demonstration is our right. We did not violate any law," the MLA said.
