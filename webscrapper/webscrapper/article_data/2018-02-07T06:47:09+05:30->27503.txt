Dhananjay, a Std XI student, has a long 12-hour schedule every day. His time is not taken up by coaching classes or tuitions, but by an unending wait for the state transport bus which takes him to college and back. Though college starts at 11am, he has to catch the bus at 8am as there are no services available later to take him to   city. Then, when his college ends at 3pm, he has to wait till 7pm for a bus to return home.

 Ravi Bapatley, who runs the shelter home, said they have a small vehicle to take the children to a nearby school and sometimes to the college as well, but with eight children studying in Std X this year, we need a bigger vehicle. “The dance and music show is a compilation of folk art, music, dance and mimicry,” he said.
