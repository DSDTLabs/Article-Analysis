LUCKNOW: The UP government is planning a powerpacked start to the New Year by deciding to gift a brand new super-critical 660 MW power unit at   in Kanpur to citizens of the state.

 Informed sources in the state energy department said that chief minister   is likely to lay the foundation stone of the new unit in January. The 660 MW plant would be the first stateowned power unit to be installed by   government almost 10 months after it stormed to power in March 2017.
 
 UP   (UPRVUNL) director (technical), BS   confirmed that the board of directors has given its nod to the new unit proposed to be set up at Panki.
 
 Sources said that a proposal to this effect is likely to be taken by the energy task force of the state government this week itself and the new unit is most likely to be constructed by   (BHEL).
 
 The nod to the setting up of a super-critical unit at Panki comes days after the state government decided to close down two 40 years old units of 110 MW capacity.
 
 However, since the bigger new unit would need a much larger area, the residential colony of Panki employees may have to be bulldozed and its residents shifted.
 
 Chairman of the All India Power Engineers’ Federation (AIPEF),   said that the state government should focus on other such projects and convert sub-critical units into super critical units. “This would reduce the state government’s dependence on power projects in private sector,” he said.
 
 The ministry of environment and forest had rejected environment clearance to the project in 2016 citing pollution concerns. However, after the BJP came to power, a team of experts from MoEF visited the site and a nod was given to the project eventually.
