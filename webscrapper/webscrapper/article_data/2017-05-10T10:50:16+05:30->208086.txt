AURANGABAD: The   ( ) sleuths of the   unit have been deployed at the house of the senior clerk of the zilla parishad primary education department to nab him. 

  The senior clerk was named as the co-accused in a bribery case. 
 
 Two teachers of the Aurangabad zilla parishad's primary education department alleged that a bribe was sought from them to issue their transfer orders. 
 
 On Monday evening, the junior clerk of the ZP education department accepted the ACB's powdered currency notes of Rs 20, 000 from the two teachers and was caught by the ACB.
 
 As per the complaint lodged by the ACB, the suspect   (43), a junior assistant at ZP education department (primary section) and a colleague allegedly demanded Rs 30,000 as bribe for handing over the transfer letter to the two teachers, who have been transferred to   district.
 
 However, around the same time as More accepted the bribe, his colleague received a call from his boss asking him to report to his chamber for discussing ideal teacher award.
 
 Before the sleuths could nab him, he left the spot. He learnt about More's arrest while at his senior's office and has been on the run since then. The ACB, in an attempt to arrest him, have deployed personnel at Chavan's house.
