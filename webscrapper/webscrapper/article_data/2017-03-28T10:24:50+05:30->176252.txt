Margao: Velim gram sabha made a resolution on Sunday asking the Velim village panchayat to file a case against the officials of   in the village without the required permissions from the panchayat. “The panchayat had received a proposal from   to erect their mobile towers along with letters from the   Division VI superintendent engineer and the director of panchayats. It was placed during the panchayat body meeting held on March 15, but as there were no supporting documents such as their location plan and the clearance from the Goa state pollution control board (GSPCB). So, it was resolved to close the application for non-submission of plan,” said Velim sarpanch Melwin Sanches. But on March 25 around 2.30am, Sanches received a phone call from a panch member saying that she saw a crane erecting a mobile tower under the pretext of installing an electricity pole. Sanches phoned the police and informed them about. “Today, the gram sabha insisted that an FIR be filed against the firm officials,” said Sanches. The gram sabha also discussed the proposed extension of the Velim jetty. Also, resolutions were passed to issue demand notices to the defaulters of house (residential) and commercial taxes, who have been cautioned that if they failed to pay within 15 days then they will be charged 12% interest. Similarly, demand notices would also be issued to defaulters of trade licences if they failed to pay.
