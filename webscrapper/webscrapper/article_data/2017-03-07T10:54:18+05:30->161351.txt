Ishita is talking her heart out to Shagun and Gulabo. She tells them how Raman never called her after their date and his attention is all she needs.
 
  Raman quickly calls his secretary and asks her to deliver gifts and a note to Ishita.
  
  Nidhi on the other hand, is keen to know about Gulabo's truth. She decides to check her handbag.
  
  Ruhi goes to Adi and sees him worried. Adi tells her that he has to send tender quotations and Raman and Romi aren't available and he is confused. Ruhi decides to help him and comes up with quotes. But he disagrees and puts his quote.
  
  
 
  
  Nidhi finds Raman's passport in Gulabo's bag and gets shocked. Ishita gets chocolate cake, gajras and a note from Raman. She gets excited. Nidhi then follows Gulabo and hears her talking to Romi in Raman's voice. She figures out that Gulabo is Raman.
  
  Gulabo takes a day off from work and calls Ishita as Raman and tells her that he wants to take Pihu and her somewhere out. Ishita gets happy.
  
  Romi goes to office and checks the tender quotes. He finds it low and scolds Adi. He then checks Ruhi's quotes and tells him that this is what they planned to fill.
