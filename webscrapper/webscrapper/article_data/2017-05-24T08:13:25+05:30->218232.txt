MUMBAI: Next time you drive to  , do not fret over being charged a Rs 130 toll for entering the premises and halting there as the fee has now been withdrawn. 

 On Tuesday,   workers went ahead and demolished the toll collection booth that was still standing outside the terminal entrance. The workers also threatened to storm the airport if the toll collection booth was set up again. 
 
 According to a Mumbai airport official, a charge of Rs 130 was levied so that people come to drop passengers in vehicles donâ€™t loiter near the entrance and exit quickly so as to avoid traffic congestion. But flyers have been up in arms against the charge, saying that the toll collectors were ruthless and would slap a receipt in no time, not giving the them enough time to get out of the vehicle and enter the terminal building.
 
 An airport official said they had stopped collecting toll since three-four days. But   (MIAL) refused to comment.
 
  Before vandalised the toll collection booth, the Sena workers, led by party MLC  , protested outside the airport against the toll. The protesters tore receipt books and shouted slogans against the airport operator. They warned that if the toll booth was set up again, they would barge into the airport and shut it down.
 
 On May 19, the Sena had sent a letter to MIAL and warned it about a Sena-style agitation if the operator did not stop collecting Rs 130 from vehicles entering the airport. Parab had warned that it would not take much time for Sena workers to enter the airport and protest if MIAL does not stop collecting the illegal toll. He said that thousands of commuters were being illegally looted by the company as there was no agreement or permission or any rule to charge Rs 130 from vehicles entering the airport premises.
