NEW DELHI:   captain   is an epitome of a modern day athlete. A strict routine has helped him transform into one of the most consistent and arguably the fittest cricketers today. Be it his batting, captaincy or a healthy lifestyle, he is a role model not just for his peers but also for the upcoming young generation. 

 While he often shares his fitness routine on social media platforms, the 28-year-old on Saturday recommended a book that he says has transformed his perspective on life.
 
 Kohli has posted a picture of himself on Instagram holding a book called "
 " and recommends it to everyone as he believes it has the power to "change your whole perspective and life."
 
 "I love this book. A must read for all those who are brave enough to let their thoughts and ideologies be challenged. The understanding and implementation of the knowledge in this book will change your whole perspective and life. Believe in the divine and keep marching on doing good deeds #onelove#begrateful#helponeanother," Kohli posted on the social networking site.
 
  
  
 Kohli, in the past seven months, has led India to series victories over West Indies, New Zealand, England and Bangladesh. In these four series, he has also hit four double-centuries – one in each – which is an all-time record. Due to his record-breaking form across formats, Kohli has seen a rapid rise in his brand value which is now pegged at whopping $92 million, next only to Bollywood actor   ($131 million). And he will aim to extend his winning spree when India face Australia in a four-Test series that starts from February 23.
