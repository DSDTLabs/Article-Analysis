MYSURU: Chief minister Siddaramaiah is caught between the proverbial devil and the deep sea.

 The CM decided to contest from   after giving up Varuna, which he is representing since 2008, to set the stage for his son Dr Yathindra to make his electoral debut and continue the family legacy. But now, Siddaramaiah is facing the combined force of the JD(S) and BJP, which want to nip his ambition of returning to power again.
 
 Taking it as a challenge, Siddaramaiah campaigned in Chamundeshwari constituency to reconnect with the people, who have elected him five times, by whipping up sentiment.
 
 During one of his roadshows, Siddaramaiah expressed his dilemma when he told voters that the people of Varuna also wanted him to contest but he opted for Chamudeshwarai for a strong reason.
 
 “I want to end my political career by getting elected from Chamundeshwari, since it was you people who sent me to the lower house for the first time in 1983 and also gave me political rebirth in the 2006 bypoll. This cannot happen without your support,’’ Siddaramaiah said.
 
 After delimitation of assembly constituencies in 2008, when he had to choose between the two segments, he opted for Varuna, saying his native Siddaramanahundi is attached to Varuna.
 
 However, the upcoming Chamundeshwari poll promises to be a throwback to 2006 when Siddaramaiah had quit the JD(S) after being sacked from the deputy CM’s post, and joined the Congress.
 
 Sitting JD(S) MLA G T Devegowda has been openly inviting Siddaramaiah to contest from Chamundeshwari against him. His confidence stems from the fact that two influential leaders -- Dalit leader V Srinivasa Prasad and former Congress MP A H Vishwanath, who had fallen out with Siddaramaiah -- are backing him this time to avenge their sacking and neglect.
 
 Siddaramaiah’s re-election, however, will set a new record. Since Janata Party leader Ramakrishna Hedge’s re-election in 1985, no CM has been re-elected to office.
