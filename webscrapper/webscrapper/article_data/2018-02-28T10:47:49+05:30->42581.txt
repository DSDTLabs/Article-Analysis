PUNE: Infosys founder N R   on Tuesday said his   H V Sahasrabuddhe’s advice stood him in good stead as he had embarked on his career path. 

 In 1969, when faced with a prospect of a high paying job or learning something “cutting edge,” an undecided Murthy was “nudged” by Sahasrabuddhe to take up learning over salary.
 
 “I do not regret that decision even as the job I took up paid half of what other companies had offered,” said the 71-year-old Murthy while attending Sahasrabuddhe’s 75th birthday celebration organised by the Savitribai Phule Pune University.
 
 Sahasrabuddhe was the founder of the university’s computer science department and is credited for pioneering the masters of computers application programme in India.
 
 Murthy said while doing his masters from IIT-Kanpur with a specialisation in computer science, he and his batchmates had an average of 4-5 jobs from companies such as   (now Tata Motors), Tisco, HMT and AirIndia.
 
  When Murthy met Krishnayya, the latter told him that he was going to bring the most modern computing system to India. 
 
 “When I went back to my hostel, some of my friends said, ‘you should also talk to somebody of your generation’. That is when I met Sahasrabuddhe, who had completed his PhD in 1968,” he added.
 
 “I told him that the only catch is that the job offered by Krishnayya paid only Rs 800. Sahasrabuddhe told me, ‘If I were you, I will focus on learning.’ It was a   in the right direction,” Murthy said.
 
 Asked if that helped set up Infosys, Murthy said, “That decision helped me… I also got an opportunity to develop an operating system for an airport in Paris. I would not have got it if not for my experience in IIM-Ahmedabad.”
