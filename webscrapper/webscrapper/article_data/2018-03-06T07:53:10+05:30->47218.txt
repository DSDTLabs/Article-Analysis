AHMEDABAD:   from Vadgam,  , is set to become Gujarat’s own ‘Padman’. He is set to launch an initiative to produce and distribute   to women in his constituency, Vadgam in Palanpur district, on the eve of International Women’s Day. He said he will explore possibilities to provide sanitary pads at affordable prices and try to break the stigma linked to menstruation.

 The  , who came to the forefront after the uproar over the July 2016 Una flogging incident, said he wants women to discard taboos associated with menstruation, so they can have hygienic and healthy lives. 
 
 “On March 7, we will launch a sanitary pads project in one village of Vadgam. This project is at the heart of women’s overall health and hopes to provide some relief during their monthly cycles. We found that even nowadays, several decades after Independence, women in villages use rags of synthetic fabric during their monthly cycle. We will also be distributing sanitary pads made of eco-friendly cotton. We will also install a sewing machine, with the help of medical experts, which can be used by women to make sanitary pads on their own,” Mevani told TOI.
 
 When asked about the origin of idea, he said, “We are part of such a patriarchal system where women’s health issues are often being neglected. The menstruation period, a natural process, is seen as taboo. I link it with public health, education, culture and even the caste system, as women are considered untouchable during their period. So I decided to take up this untouched issue to help the women of my constituency.” Mevani said he will try to set up a small scale sanitary pad production unit in Vadgam which can employ local women.
