BENGALURU: Repeatedly bragging about the   he had bought for his wife   proved costly for hairdresser K Srinivas, a resident of Bharathinagar. His friend N Ramesh murdered her for it.

 According to police, Srinivas and Ramesh were friends and the former had been boasting for some time about the gold chain he had bought for Chandrakala. Ramesh, who was in a financial crisis, decided to steal the chain and clear his debts. Since Ramesh frequently visited Srinivas’ house, he thought he’d take the chain when Srinivas was not at home.
 
 Preliminary investigation revealed that Ramesh went to Chandrakala’s house on April 19. Srinivas told police: “I rushed home after my relative Puneeth told me that Chandrakala was lying unconscious. We shifted her to a private nursing home and doctors declared her brought dead. I noticed that her gold chain was missing. ”
 
 When cops said someone known to the family had entered the house, Srinivas zeroed in on his friend. “Ramesh came to my shop that morning. I strongly suspect Ramesh of killing her and stealing the chain,” he told police.
 
 Based on the complaint, police nabbed Ramesh from his residence in Doddaballapur and recovered Rs 1.2 lakh in cash and the 75gm gold chain from him.
 
 “Listening to Srinivas talking endlessly about the chain, Ramesh thought there was a lot of cash in the house. On the afternoon of April 19, he barged into Srinivas’s house and was trying to break open the cupboard when Chandrakala saw him. Realising that she could identify him as a thief, Ramesh stabbed her to death, robbed her gold chain and took the cash in the cupboard,” police said.
