RANCHI: The old   at Kokar has been renovated in a short span of six months and is as good as new.   is now planning a facelift of the entire stretch from Lalpur Chowk to the bridge, which is almost a kilometre long. 

 As per the plan, a pond will be made on the right side of the distillery bridge while a parking spot and a non-vegetarian market will be set up one the left side.
 
 "Over the years, there have been objections about non-vegetarian items being sold near   situated near the bridge. We have decided to relocate all the non-vegetarian stalls in the basement of the parking lot to be constructed," deputy mayor   said.
 
 The parking lot will have a holding capacity of 40 four wheelers, while the basement will provide space for 100 non-vegetarian stalls, he added. This apart, the vegetable market on either side of the road leading from Lalpur to Distillery Bridge, will be made more organised. "This way, vegetable vendors will not be able to set up stalls on the road," Vijayavargiya said.
 
 While the exact budget for the project is yet to be decided, the funds will include Rs 1 crore which was sanctioned for the construction of Lalpur Vegetable market in 2011. The remaining amount will be taken from the civil amenities fund of RMC.
