MUMBAI: Mumbaikars can breathe easy as the seven lakes supplying water to the city have sufficient stock—nearly 22%—to last till July, said civic officials. 

 Monsoon is expected to arrive in Mumbai within a fortnight. 
 
 As of May 25, the city has approximately 3.16 lakh million litres of water, compared to 3.21 lakh million litres on the same day last year. “There will be no water cuts as of now as there is sufficient water stock in the lakes. In fact, from this year, we have even started supplying an additional 50 million litres of water daily to the city,” said an official from the   hydraulic department, on condition of anonymity. 
 
 The city requires 4,200 million litres of water daily. Earlier, the municipal corporation would supply 3,750mld of water to the city every day. From this year, water supply has been increased to 3,800 million litres daily. In 2016, owing to poor rainfall, the BMC implemented a 20% water cut in the city for the entire year. But last year, monsoon exceeded expectations and all seven lakes overflowed. 
 
 By September 19, 2017, the total water stock stood at 14.2 lakh million litres when the entire year’s requirement is 14.47 lakh million litres by the end of monsoon. 
 
 The city receives water from seven lakes:   and Vihar; which are located within the city limits inside Sanjay Gandhi National Park; and Upper Vaitarna, Modak Sagar, Tansa, Middle Vaitarna and Bhatsa; which are located outside the city limits.
