CHENNAI: A decrepit building near a busy turning on  , before the  , is little more than a century old structure, now overgrown with vegetation, for people in the area. For 'explorers', the nondescript iron gate takes them inside a house with many tales.

 Behind a clump of trees, unseen by children of the high school across the road, is the skeleton of what was once the Salt Bungalow.Built in 1902, it served for decades as resting quarters for officials of the Salt Department. The high ceilings and part of an iron spiral staircase are the only signs of its British makers.
 
 Ramalingam, who was part of the salt trade decades ago and is caretaker of the now privately owned building, is the lone memory keeper of the days when the bungalow had a regal look. In its heyday, he recalls, salt department officials from around the country came down for in spection and stayed here.The practice continued when the Indian administrators took over. “I remember the days when there was no electricity and kerosene lamps used to light up the rooms. The bungalow has seen a lot,“ he says. Salt pans in Vedaranyam, Marakkanam, Thoothukudi, and in Ennore used to be monitored by officials who rested at the Salt Bungalow. It fell into disuse a few years after Independence.
 
 After it was sold to private owners in the 1960s, it became the favourite of filmmakers who considered it a perfect backdrop for films. MGR's `Naalai Namadhe', `Enge Mama' were some of the famous movies that were shot here, remembers Ramalingam, now in his late 70s.
 
 Today , more a relic than a resort, trees have taken root in its foundation. “A cyclone in 1994 destroyed much of the building,“ he says. The structure is now a remnant of a time when Ennore was a popular weekend getaway and not just known for its thermal power station.
