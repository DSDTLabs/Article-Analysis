KOCHI:The motor vehicles department ( ) is planning to add momentum to their crackdown on   by placing additional officers at Aroor   on NH47. The officers will slap fine on motorists for unnecessary honking and will track down vehicles coming from other regions with air horns at the plaza.

 “Many motorists use horns at the plaza continuously. We will slap fines of Rs 100 each against violators. Motorists should use horns only to alert employees to open the gate at the plaza,” said M P Ajithkumar, deputy transport commissioner.
 
 He said that the new squad would be placed by Monday.
 
 The move will be a part of their campaign against noise pollution in the district and the second phase of their initiative. The first stage focused solely on air horns.
 
 As part of the No-Horn Day, MVD had conducted drive in the city against air horns that create noise at the level of 120 decibel and more. According to MVD, the accepted noise level is restricted at112 decibel.
 
 “We have been conducting routine checks across various bus stands in the city to prevent use of air horns in vehicles. Due to continuous inspection, we found out that there has been a significant reduction in the number of buses using air horns. We found that most of the buses using these horns are those traveling to Kottayam and other regions. But only 2% of these buses come to the stand and most of these vehicles can only be intercepted on the highway,” said Ajithkumar.
 
 He said that special squads placed at Aroor toll plaza will be responsible for conducting checks for air horns.
 
 “These vehicles come here once in a few months. So, it is important that these checks are maintained at the highway itself. The squad will be equipped with tools to dismantle the horns and to snap the connection to fit air horns,” the officer said.
