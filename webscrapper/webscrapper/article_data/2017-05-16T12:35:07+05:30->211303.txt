Trichy: The process of registering complaints about   of food commodities and inferior food quality is all set to become easy with the Tamil Nadu food safety department introducing a WhatsApp number for grievance redressal. 

 On Monday, the Trichy district administration informed people that they can lodge complaints to the food safety department in Chennai on the WhatsApp number â€“ 94440 42322. The number will be accessed by a state-level officer. The complaints will be forwarded to the designated officer (DO) of the food safety department in respective districts. Thereafter, the food safety officer (FSO) of the taluk will receive the complaints on his smart phone and will start an inquiry.
 
 Though the number was officially released by the district administration on Monday, it had already received a few complaints from Trichy. A complaint about inferior quality biscuits was one of the complaints received recently on the number.
 
 The purpose of introducing a dedicated WhatsApp number for receiving complaints is to reduce the time gap between the date of filing the complaint and the action taken on it, said officials.
 
 They said the volume of complaints received is likely to increase as people become familiar with the number. People can lodge complaints about inferior quality of the food and food products, use of carbide stones for ripening mangoes, sale of commodities beyond the expiry date, and manufacturing date or expiry date missing on the label, among others. 
 
 Officials said that adulteration of edible oil is a worrying trend in the district. This involves mixing of rice bran oil or palm oil with gingelly oil. 
 
 Meanwhile, designated officers in all districts in the state have been ordered to submit a compiled report on action taken on complaints received on the number.
