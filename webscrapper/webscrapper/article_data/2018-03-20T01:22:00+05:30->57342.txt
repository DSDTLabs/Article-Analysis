EDITED

 Kolkata: Nine persons, including two Bangladeshis, were detained for questioning in the city on Monday for allegedly running a   racket that passed off Bangladeshis as Indians before sending them off to Europe with Indian visas. 
 
 Police said the gang – that has been operational for the past eight months – has so far managed to send several Bangladeshis to Europe after initially putting them up in Kolkata and Burdwan guesthouses.
 
 According to police sources, a joint team of detective department’s anti-rowdy squad and the anti-fraud section detained these men from central Kolkata and Burdwan based on a specific tip-off saying some men had gone missing in European countries after taking work visas. “The accused came to Kolkata using tourist visas,” an investigating officer said. 
 
 Further arrests were likely in this case because many more people had helped the gang arrange fakes. “At least four to six men helped the gang make forged passports. They are being traced,” the officer said. “Apart from dealing in fake passports, the gang, we believe, also dealt in forged voter identity cards and PAN and Aadhaar cards to help illegal Bangladeshi immigrants.”
 
 The investigators have also come to know that the gang had a widespread network in areas close to the India-Bangladesh border in North 24 Parganas. “The gang used to charge lakhs from the applicants. We will need to find out how this money got divided among the big players of this gang,” said an officer at Lalbazar.
