MOHALI: There are at least 12 private mini-buses plying on the road between  ,  ,   and   - all of them have no permits to run on these roads. The conductors offer no tickets and have no fixed rates for different distances - passengers are charged according to the whims of conductors. 

  Kuldeep Singh, resident of Zirakpur village, said, "I have been travelling on these buses for over a year. I have never got a ticket. Sometimes, these buses even travel to Mohali town. They are causing losses to   by picking up their passengers." 
 
  TOI was unable to identify the owners of these vehicles - the drivers and conductors have been hired by the bus owners. The mini-bus operations are in flagrant violation of safety rules and guidelines. 
 
  The irony is that the administration too is unaware that these buses operate. SDM Ruhi Dugg of Zirakpur zone said, "The matter was not in my knowledge. Now that it has come to my notice, I will look into it and deploy a team to check such illegal buses. Action will be taken as per law." 
 
  TOI asked the drivers of some of these buses for permits but none of them could offer any documents. These buses operate with no fixed and regular terminals or stops. They stop as they please and are sometimes parked in residential areas. 
 
 There are no safety mechanisms in place, in case of emergency. In case of a fire, people could well be trapped in the vehicle. 
 
 Traffic police are often seen parked on the roadside at  , issuing challans to overloaded auto rickshaws. However, the policemen have never checked the flagrant violation of rules by these mini-buses. 
 
 One traffic official said, "We were not aware about the permit of these buses. We have never checked for such permits. We will, however, start checking now and if we find that they are indeed running without permits, we will not just issue challans but seize the vehicles."
