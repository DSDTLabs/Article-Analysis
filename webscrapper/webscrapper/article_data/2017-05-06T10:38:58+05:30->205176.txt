The rankings were decided on the basis of availability of toilet, sewerage connectivity, door to door garbage collection and adequate dustbins in houses.
 
 Shimla deputy mayor   however is of the view that the ranking needs to be assessed objectively as it might be faulty. 
 
 According to him, there should have been a different set of criteria for analysing the hill stations as they face different adversities and the cost of infrastructure is almost four times than in the cities in the plains.
 
  "Door to door garbage collection is arduous as vehicles cannot reach every house. Workers should be deployed in large numbers to carry out such an operation. As for the toilets in Shimla, water supply is not regular and hence supply is not consistent unlike in the plains," Panwar added.
