NAVI MUMBAI:   will soon get the first integrated   in the city, which will combine general police and traffic units. The new police station will be constructed on a 1,940 sq m plot in sector 19 and sources have said that there will be stilt parking in the new complex.

  senior PRO, Mohan Ninawe said, “We have built police stations in the city but the one at Koparkhairane will be different. We are working on the design and cost estimate.”
 
 The existing general police station in the node is in a rented premise and it takes a hit during heavy rains. There is a small traffic chowky on the plot where the integrated police station will be developed, said sources.
 
 DCP (Traffic), Nitin Pawar told TOI on Saturday that the traffic unit will be part of the integrated police station and it will help in better policing. “There are 16 traffic units, including a temporary one at Gavan phata,” he added.
 
 The general police station has total staff strength of 109 while the traffic unit has 11 personnel, but when combined, the total number of officers would increase to around 21. It will also ensure that the general police will also help in containing traffic menace due to shortage of staff in the traffic unit. 
 
 Local resident and activist, Saurabh Pandya, has been pursuing the issue of a bigger and better police station with various state government authorities. He communicated via online letters with the authorities including the governor, Cidco, urban development department and police commissionerate. Pandya said local Shiv Sena MP Rajan Vichare also intervened.
 
 The busy node will now have more police personnel which will help in monitoring the traffic certain area such as near the busy hub of D Mart and the suburban railway station.
