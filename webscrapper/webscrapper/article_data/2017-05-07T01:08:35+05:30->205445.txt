NEW DELHI: A   went out of control in   on Saturday morning and   The accused driver also rammed his car into a motorbike and hurt its riders while backing away from the spot. 

 Locals from the area told the cops that the victim, yet to be identified, used to sleep in the same spot on the pavement every night. Like every night, he came to sleep at the pavement around 11pm on Friday night. 
 
 The next morning, however, he was crushed by the van which was allegedly speeding. Though the accused immediately took his car down from the pavement, he rammed into a motorbike crossing the area — injuring the driver and the pillion rider. 
 
 Police said that the driver, later identified as Vinod (44), did not flee from the spot or try to evade arrest. A few passersby immediately informed the police. A team of cops was rushed to the spot and all the injured were taken to the hospital, where the labourer succumbed to his injuries during treatment.
 
 The two injured motorbike riders had received minor injuries and were discharged within two hours after treatment. 
 
 Police said that the victim’s body is preserved at a mortuary and efforts are being made to identify him. They said that his picture has been circulated in all police stations and missing complaints are also being scanned to ascertain his identity. 
 
 “We have registered a case against the accused driver and he has been taken into custody,” said a senior police official. The accused is a resident of Shastri Park and runs the van as a cab. 
 
 At the time of incident, Vinod was going to a place in Kashmere Gate to pick up passengers and drop them to some place in Seelumpur. Cops said that the accused driver was not inebriated while driving.
