KOCHI: The   has asked   (KSFE) to refund money collected from a man who stood as surety for a loan taken by his colleague even though the loan was recovered in full. KSFE had declined to return the money by stating that he was a surety for other  .

 A single bench of the court considered a petition (WP-C No. 8402/2014) filed by KP Kunjan of Karapuzha in Kottayam, who had retired from KSRTC in April 2007. Kunjan and his colleague PK Thankappan had obtained loans of Rs50,000 each from KSFE and they were sureties for each other.
 
 Both Kunjan and Thankappan defaulted on the loans and retired from service. Based on instruction from KSFE, KSEB recovered the outstanding amounts from their retirement benefits. 
 
 However, KSEB wrongly sent the money to KSFE branch instead of the revenue recovery unit of KSFE. Without realizing that Thankappan’s loan was already recovered, the outstanding amount was recovered from Kunjan’s retirement benefits. Later, in June 2010, KSFE realized the mistake and transferred the money recovered from Thankappan to the revenue recovery unit.
 
 When Kunjan came to know about the mix-up, he approached KSFE and sought for returning the extra money collected from him – 87,312. But KSFE declined a refund by stating that he was a surety for loans taken by some other employees too that remained unpaid.
 
 While ruling in favour of Kunjan, the high court pointed out that even though the law allows KSFE to proceed against the surety even prior to acting against the principal debtor, action can only be taken if the debt is outstanding.
 
 Ordering KSFE to refund the money, the court said, “Neither for the lapse of the employer in sending the amount to the wrong Unit nor for the lapse of the very lender, the KSFE, in not transferring the amount inter-departmentally, could Kunjan suffer.”
