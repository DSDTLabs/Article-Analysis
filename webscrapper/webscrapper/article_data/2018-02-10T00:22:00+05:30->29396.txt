Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh’s health is a matter of concern. The first Health Index released by Niti Aayog on Friday places MP at 17th position among 21 big states, followed by Odisha, Bihar and Rajasthan, with UP at the bottom.

 The state has fared poorly in key parameters like infant mortality, under-5 mortality, and immunization coverage. MP managed to scrape together 40.09 points. Chhattisgarth, which was carved out of MP, has done much better with 52.2 points and is placed 12th. MP is followed by Odisha (39.43), Bihar (38.46) and Rajasthan (36.79).
 
 In neonatal mortality, MP is at an abysmal 20th rank, with 34 newborn deaths per 1,000 in 2015 — down by just one over 2014. Only Odisha has done worse. In under-5 mortality, it’s at the bottom of the pile, at 62 deaths per 1,000 children (down from 65). Assam has the same figure but is placed one notch higher because it has a better recovery rate — from 66 to 62.
 
 In low birth weight, MP is placed at 16th position with 14.1%, and it’s worst in immunistion coverage at just 74.8% — far short of the target of 90%. Though it fares better in functional public health centres — placed 6th — it is a dismal 20th rank in availability of doctors (58%) at PHCs. It’s quick in transfer of central funds to implementing institutions, placed 4th in the country.
 
 Madhya Pradesh also fared badly in incremental and overall performance, being placed with the ‘least improved states’ along with Assam and Odisha. The incremental measurement shows that about one-third of the states have registered a decline in their health indices in 2015-16 as compared with the base year 2014-15. “This is a matter of concern and should nudge the states into reviewing and revitalizing their programmatic efforts,” the Niti Ayog document says.
 
 There is a large gap in overall performance between the best and the least performing states and UTs. The figures project a grim outlook for healthcare in MP. In the past, the National Family Health Survey-4 had put Madhya Pradesh first among 10 states in malnutrition among children.
