 Raj, who plays the lead role in  , married Shruthi, a television producer. Both of them were also part of the reality dance show   as well. Ask him the experience of over dramatisation in such shows, Rio says, “I had already told the TV crew that I won’t do things that are over the top.   and I decided that we won’t cry whatever happens, and maintained the same throughout the show.”

 However, he is quick to admit that he got emotional for real, during his wedding reception. “I was shooting till the previous night. The entire work related to the wedding was handled by Shruthi and two of my friends. At the reception when I saw to it how they had toiled to make it a picture-perfect event, I did get emotional,” admits Rio.
