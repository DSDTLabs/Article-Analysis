VADODARA: An inspector and a class II officer of District Industries Centre ( ) of Panchmahal were arrested from Godhra by the anti-corruption bureau ( ) allegedly taking bribe of Rs 67,500 from a businessman to sanction his subsidy.

 Sources in ACB Vadodara circle that arrested inspector   Gohil and his aide N G Chandana, the class II officer, said that the duo had initially demanded Rs 80,000, which was 5% of the subsidy, from the complainant Sumit Khandelwal. 
 
 Khandelwal had started a water bottling plant at Halol GIDC for which he was to receive a subsidy of Rs 16 lakh from the state government.
 
 In June last year, Khandelwal had applied for the subsidy, but his file was not being cleared by the two accused. An ACB official said that in July the duo demanded five per cent to move his file forward. But after negotiations, they agreed upon Rs 67,500. Meanwhile, Khandelwal informed ACB about the demand of bribe.
 
 On Saturday, when Khandelwal was supposed to give Rs 10,000 as first instalment, ACB sleuths laid a trap and nabbed the duo.
