 Records of the  , where Saturday night's mishap occured, show that there is 24% vacancy in the posts of safety officials. Across India, a whopping 1.42 lakh posts of safety staff remain vacant, a reality that experts term worrisome and a clear case of official apathy.
 
 “The pressure on safety staff has remained very high over the years. This has also been pointed out in various internal reports. Not only are there many vacancies but the existing staff work un der sub-standard conditions too. While higher-ups in the ministry might be awaiting assistance of technology before filling vacant posts, the automated anti-collision device that was tested earlier does not seem promising.

 “With such high vacancies in critical posts, mishaps are bound to happen. Engineering and signalling staff and even loco pilots frequently work for 20-24 hours straight due to the vacancies. Even the SCR zone has over 10,000 vacancies in safety staff,“ said K Shivakumar, divisional secretary of  .
 
 To make matters worse, the government railway police remains largely unstaffed across zones. “In general, vacancies in GRP are very high. About 40% posts are vacant,“ said T Krishnaprasad, additional DG (Railway and Road Safety) Telangana.
