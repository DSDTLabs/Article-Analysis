 is an actor who needs no introduction. With long innings in Sandalwood and other regional industries, including   and Telugu, she’s a household name. And all those decades of experience will now come to the fore as the veteran actor is soon set to turn director. Titled  , the film will be a rib-tickler with a social message. “I have always wanted to direct; in fact the thought occurred to me 18 years ago. I was shooting for the film Mangalasutra with Vishnu sir then, and had a storyline in mind that would feature the two of us. Somehow it didn’t work out then due to various factors, but I had willed to myself that I’d direct someday,” says Vinaya Prasad. And when she finally decided to take up direction, it was only because she was bowled over by the story and screenplay of her impending film. “It has been penned by my husband  , who has been the think tank for many ad agencies in Mumbai. Besides, technically too, I wanted to be sound and my years of observing shot placements, lighting and the manner in which our technicians highlight scenes have contributed beyond measure in shaping my directorial launch pad,” she states. “And comedy,” adds the actor, “is a genre that I have always been fond of. Being of the belief that a good laugh is the best cure to dispel any kind of tension, I felt it was the best theme to begin my directorial journey,” she says. The film will go on the floors in April and will also feature husband Jyothi Prakash and their daughter   and besides other senior actors.
