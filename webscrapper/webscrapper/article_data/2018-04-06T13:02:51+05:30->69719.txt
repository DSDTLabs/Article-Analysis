Those opposing the mega port announced a protest at the same venue on April 7. 
 
 To counter this protest, the BJP announced a bandh the same day. District president of the BJP, Muthukrishnan who made the announcement on Thursday alleged that anti-national elements and those opposing progress in the region are opposing the port. He said the port would boost employment in the region and result in economic growth. TNN
