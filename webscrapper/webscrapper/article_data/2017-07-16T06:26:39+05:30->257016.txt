PATIALA: After writing a letter to Union finance minister   seeking GST exemption for purchases made by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) to run free langar, its president   has now sent a letter to Punjab chief minister Captain   asking him to do away with the state component of the new tax.

 GST has two components namely the central GST and the state GST levied by the Union government and the state, respectively. The rates for the central and state GST have been prescribed equally.
 
 In his letter, Badungar said the main income of the gurdwaras came from the offerings made by the pilgrims. He said the money collected was spent on running langar at all gurdwaras managed by the SGPC, besides helping the poor, propagation of Sikh religion and promoting sports.
 
 Badungar said, all  purchased at Akal Takht, Amritsar, Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib, Anandpur Sahib and Takht Damdama Sahib, Talwandi Sabo were exempted under the previous tax regime. Bandungar said the implementation of GST would put a burden of Rs 10 crore burden on the SGPC.
 
 He said while the issue of exemption of the CGST had already been taken up with the Union government, the Punjab government should also take the matter into consideration and grant complete exemption on all purchases made by the committee for its gurdwaras.
 
 Badungar expressed hope that the request made by the SGPC would find favours with the Union and the state government and it would soon be exempted from paying the GST on langar items.
