AHMEDABAD: The content in   and English question papers which was supposed to be the same turned out to be completely different for the students appearing for the NEET  . Besides that, they found the regional language paper to be tougher. 

 Rohit Rawal, a private tutor from the city, said, "All the 180 questions were different in both Gujarati and English papers. Besides that, the questions of Gujarati were tougher than the questions of English language paper."
