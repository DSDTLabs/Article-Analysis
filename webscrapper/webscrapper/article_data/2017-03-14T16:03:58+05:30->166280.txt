THRISSUR:   on the blood samples detected from the office rooms of the   and Research Centre (NCERC), Pambady have indicated that they are similar to that of the deceased engineering student Jishnu Pranoy, lending credence to the suspicion that he was tortured by the college staff before death.

 The blood samples were of O+ group, which was the blood group of Jishnu and as well as that of both his parents.
 
 Following this the investigating officers on Tuesday took blood samples from the parents of Jishnu Asokan and Mahija for carrying out DNA tests. These tests are expected to confirm whether the blood traces detected at the college room were that of Jishnu. The blood samples of the parents were collected at the Taluk hospital at Nadapuram, in Kozhikode, in presence of the members of the special investigating team from Thrissur.
 
 According to the top police sources the blood samples detected at the college room were analysed at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Thiruvananthapuram.
 
 In fact, the relatives and friends of the deceased had informed the police about the blood stains in the body of Jishnu as well as in the bathroom where the body was found on January 6. But the police dismissed these suspicions. The family members later released the audio of the telephonic conversations of fellow student of Jishnu saying blood samples were seen on the body and in the bathroom.
 
 Subsequently, forensic experts examined the college rooms and detected blood stains in the rooms of the vice principal and the PRO. The investigating team then collected samples from the rooms for analyses.
 
 The DNA tests on the blood samples will be carried out with the permission of the Judicial first class magistrate of Wadakkanchery where the police have filed the case relating to the “unnatural death’’ of Jishnu.
