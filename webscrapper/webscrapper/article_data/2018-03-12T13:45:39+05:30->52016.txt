NEW DELHI:   is planning to visit Bangladesh and Nepal in the coming months to showcase his government’s support to the South Asian partners based on his government’s ‘neighbourhood first’ policy.
 
  While Nepal has been warming up to India since its recent polls, Modi’s proposed visit to Bangladesh is critical as the Sheikh Hasina government hopes to clinch Teesta river watersharing pact with India in an election year.
  
  Vijay Gokhale could visit Dhaka in the near future on his maiden trip as foreign secretary to give further momentum to the warm partnership, people aware of the matter said.
  
  These visits, besides a PM’s trip to Bhutan, are being planned in the first half of year amid China’s relentless push to make inroads into the Himalayan states and attempts to implement projects in Bangladesh under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
  
  While a new India-backed power project is being planned in Bhutan, Teesta pact will boost ruling Awami League’s popularity in a poll year. India may soon host Nepalese PM KP Oli on his first visit abroad after his re-election as Nepal’s PM.
  
  
  dAfter the election results in Nepal, India reached out to Kathmandu immediately as foreign minister Sushma Swaraj visited the Himalayan state and held wide-ranging dialogue. Oli is understood to have responded positively to the Indian gesture.
