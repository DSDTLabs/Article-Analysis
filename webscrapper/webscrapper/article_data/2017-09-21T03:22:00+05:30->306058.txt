Margao: Margao MLA Digambar Kamat on Wednesday urged the people of Margao to take sewerage connections that would connect their houses to the underground sewerage network.

 The cost of the project that includes laying of the underground sewerage network lines through trenchless technology and construction of 20 MLD sewerage treatment plant (STP) is Rs 247 crore, it was informed.
 
 “Almost 39.5km of the total 40km of sewerage line in the town has been completed, including construction of manholes. As of now, the Goa state sewerage development corporation (GSSDC) is in a position to release 2,000 sewerage connections in Margao,” Kamat told mediapersons. The rest of the work, Kamat added, will be completed by December 31. Kamat said he held a meeting with the GSSDC officials earlier this week.
 
 Kamat said that laying of a new sewerage line from Arlem to Sirvodem, costing Rs 65 crore, has almost been completed. On the problem of overflowing of sewage in parts of Comba, he said that it would be permanently resolved once the underground sewerage project is completed. As a temporary measure, Kamat said, the sewage from these lines is pumped out and carried to the STP through night soil tankers.
