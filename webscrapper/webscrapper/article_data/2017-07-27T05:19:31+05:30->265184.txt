GURUGRAM: Upscale areas in   have been reeling under severe   crisis for the past three days, alleged residents. They said while   resumed on Wednesday afternoon, the water shortage has been there for quite some days and the problem wasn’t a new one.

 “Though the water supply is back, we cannot say our problem has ended,” said a resident of U Block, who didn’t want to be named. “There has been many instances over the past few months when there was no water supply. In some cases, it continued for weeks.”
 
 Residents have complained that due to water shortage they are forced to get water tankers, which take undue advantage of their situation and charge them more. 
 
 According to residents, the blame game between the developers and   continue in this case too. “Whenever we go to talk with DLF officials, they put the onus on Huda,” said Vinod, another resident. 
 
 When TOI approached DLF, it said it can’t be blamed for the issue. “The problem is that we receive water supply from Huda through huge lines coming through Iffco Chowk, where construction of a flyover is underway. Huda has to continuously divert these lines and by doing so supply is disrupted,” said aDLF official. 
 
 Another official from DLF blamed DLF Phase-3’s position for the water crisis. “DLF Phase-3 is at the tail-end and at a higher level. When booster station supplies water it takes around two hours for water to finally reach the area. 
 
 “So whenever the booster station stops either due to Huda diversion or power outages, it takes a lot of time before the supply is restored in the area. The overhead tank in the area can store up to 4,600 kilolitres of water, but in this case too Huda has been supplying only 1,250 kilo litre of water,” said the DLF official.
