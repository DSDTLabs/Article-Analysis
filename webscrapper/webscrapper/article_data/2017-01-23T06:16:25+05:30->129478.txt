The National Institute for High Security Animal Diseases (NISHAD) has in its recent report said that the   sent from Surat,   and Jamnagar, which reported carcasses of crows and pigeons were found negative for the dreaded virus. The only other place near Gujarat that has reported an instance of bird flu is Daman.

 In Ahmedabad, it were guineafowls and turkey that were brought from Crawford Market in Mumbai that were tested positive. These birds were kept on the premises of an NGO in Hathijan area.
 
 “According to the guidelines, egg and meat shops within 10km radius of Hathijan and Memnagar have been shut down,” said officials of the animal husbandry department. “If one cooks chicken and egg properly, which is above 70 degrees, one need not fear, as the virus cannot survive these temperatures,” said Hita Patel, director of the animal husbandry department. She confirmed that the samples of Bharuch, Surat and Jamnagar had tested negative for bird flu.
 
 Following detection of bird flu at the Sarva Dharma Rukshak Seva Trust in Memnagar area, its trustee Jasmin Shah said, “We will discontinue our bird rescue programme after this episode. The trust will continue to carry out other charity works, including providing food to poor and needy people and even distributing blankets during winter months.”
 
 Shah claimed that the animal husbandry department culled innocent birds. “Even if we ask them for the report, they are not willing to provide us the same. These birds were brought to the NGO in Memnagar from Vastral after they were deserted by a trader from Uttar Pradesh,” Shah added.
 
 With these birds, even some scheduled-I birds were culled by the department. “At Memnagar, there was not a single death between January 3 and January 13, the day these birds were culled,” he said.
