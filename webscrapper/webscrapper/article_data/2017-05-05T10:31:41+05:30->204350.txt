AGARTALA: Police are interrogating three teenagers of the Dhalabil area of Khowai in West   for their alleged involvement in the murder of their classmate Suvajit Shil (16), a student of Class X, whose mutilated body was found near the   on Wednesday. 

 Last Monday, Suvajit had gone missing from the village and his family registered a missing dairy with police.

The BGB retrieved the body and formally handed it over to BSF.
 
 Police have detained three of his classmates - Satish Santal, Litan Tanti and Joydip Ghashi - and produced them in court. They have also sought permission to interrogate them in connection with Suvajit's death. The court allowed police to do so and released them on conditional bail.
