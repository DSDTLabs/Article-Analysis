PUNE:   would be stamped with ‘security adhesive tapes’ with a   from the next fiscal in the state to check adulteration.

 Plans are also afoot to have a GPS-enabled tracking system of vehicles transporting the raw material of liquor. Besides, electromechanical locks and geo-fencing system would help estimate the vehicles’ location.
 
  cameras would also be installed in liquor distilleries. The feed from the cameras would be monitored at the central control room through internet to ensure the quality of liquor.
 
 Soon, it would become compulsory for liquor manufacturers’ as well as liquor importers’ labels to have ‘GS1 bar codes’, a globally accepted bar coding system.
 
 A senior state excise department official told TOI that all excisable items such as molasses, spirit and manufactured liquor (till the time it reaches the consumer) would be monitored through the state-of-the-art IT tools. “A committee was recently appointed to expedite this ‘track and trace’ mechanism. Various aspects of the plan would be incorporated in the relevant provisions in our licence conditions,” he said.
 
 The official said the mechanism was likely to become operational from the next financial year. “The government is very keen about introducing this mechanism. One of its provisions would be monitoring the bottling of liquor through CCTV cameras and creating exception reports pointing out discrepancies, if any. Excise   with a unique code will also be put on bottles to help us track the product,” the official said.
 
 Officials said a ‘system integrator’ would soon be appointed to coordinate the various processes involved in the mechanism.
 
 According to the provisions of the plan, vehicles transporting raw material used to manufacture liquor would be monitored from a control room with a help of GPS. Unless they reach their destination, the electromechanical locks would not open. The path and position of such vehicles would also be geo-fenced.
