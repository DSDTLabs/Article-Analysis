JAIPUR: A day after attending End-TB Summit in Delhi, health minister   on Wednesday said that the state is working on a mission to eliminate tuberculosis ( ) from the state. 

 Saraf said that in the state there are 283 TB units functional in 33 districts and Jaipur rural. There are more than 2,000 TB treatment centres, including 848 microscopy centres from where the patients are being provided with free treatment and test facilities. 
 
 Besides, the   has issued national strategic plan for tuberculosis elimination. “TB control faces daunting challenges in India. Decades of unrestrained transmission has left hundreds of millions of Indians with latent TB infection, which may re-activate at any time. A significant proportion of the population is undernourished, which weakens immunity and drives TB reactivation,” says national strategic plan ( ). 
 
 “Though the available data suggest that the TB epidemic may be on the decline, India continues to be the highest TB burden country in the world in terms of the absolute numbers of incidence cases each year. Mortality due to TB is the third leading cause of years of life lost (YLLs) lost, in the country, says NSP. 
 
 In the state, the health department officials claimed that the state has higher average than national average of detecting and treatment of TB patients.
 
 Since the multidrug resistant TB is emerging as a challenge, the health department has developed a network of 48 CB-NAAT laboratories. In these laboratories, every month on an average, 6,566 tests are conducted.
