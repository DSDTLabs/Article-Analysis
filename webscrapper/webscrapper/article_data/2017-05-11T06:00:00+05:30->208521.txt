With two big films in her kitty — Ravi Teja’s   and Nagarjuna’s   — actress   is pleased as punch. “Besides getting an opportunity to share screen with two of Tollywood’s most loved superstars, what I’m really kicked about is the prospect of seeing myself playing two drastically different characters in both the films. I play an independent urban girl who has a mind of her own in Ravi Teja’s film and in Raju Gari..., I play a glamourous dancer,” says Seerat.

 She is presently shooting for the Mass Maharaja-starrer. “I play a modern working girl who lives life on her terms. Extremely expressive, intelligent and full of life, she is very clear about what she wants in life. And my styling will also be in sync with my characterization,” reveals Seerat, talking about her role.
 
 The curly haired actress seems to be in awe of her co-star. “Ravi Teja sir’s energy is very infectious. Even though he’s a superstar, he is very humble and exudes a positive aura which rubs off on to the entire unit,” says Seerat adding “We recently started shooting for the film and the first shot we had to do was a romantic scene. To do romantic scenes, you need to build a rapport with your co-star first so that chemistry looks natural.
 
  But shooting with somebody like   sir, familiarity doesn’t matter. He’s so open, thoughtful and ends up doing things that are not written in the script, leaving everybody surprised. You have to watch the film to see that chemistry we share.”
 In Raju Gari Gadhi 2 the actress will be showing off her oomph on-screen. “I play a dancer who oozes sex appeal with the way she carries herself. She has that dancer wali adah, which adds the X factor. I’m sure the audience will fall in love with her,” she says signing off.
