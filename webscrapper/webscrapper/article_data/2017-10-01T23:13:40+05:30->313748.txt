 While talking to the TimesOfIndia.com, Hiten confessed that it is going to be difficult to stay without his kids for so long, "It has not sink in yet that I have stay without my kids for so long. I am an actor and I often shoot outdoor where I can't see my kids, but I have a privilege to talk to them or see them over phone. However, in this case I will not be able to do any of this. My wife was the one who told me to do the show. She said you better win and come or else don't do the show."
 
 The actor, who was last seen in Ganga, says he will not be a silent observer if there is a fight in the house. He will react if someone is trying to pick fight unnecessarily.
 
 "I am very patient in real life. I don't fight normally, but if someone purposely pokes me, then it becomes difficult for me to control my anger. But that happens once in a blue moon." 
 
 When asked about a habit of his that can cause problems in the Bigg Boss house for others, Hiten answered, "My kids tell me that I snore a lot at night, but I don't believe them. So I am going to use the same tactic in the Bigg Boss house too. If any contestant comes and tells me that I snore I will straight away refuse to believe it (laughs)."
