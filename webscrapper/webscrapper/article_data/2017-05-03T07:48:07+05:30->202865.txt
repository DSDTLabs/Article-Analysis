GUWAHATI:   is all set to return as president of the  ,   (ASS). Along with Borah,  , who was relieved from duties as   in January, may resume charge, said Sabha insiders. 

 "The core committee meeting of the literary body held on April 30 has given green signal for the return of the duo. While Borah has been ever-present, representing ASS in the courts pertaining to the NRC and Hindu immigrants' issues, Rajbongshi has got the approval of the powerful executive committee of the Sabha to resume his duties too," said an ASS source.
 
 ASS has been at the centre of controversy for quite some time after several noted litterateurs and former presidents questioned the functioning of the Sabha under Rajbongshi. They accused Rajbongshi of influencing the body's work through lobbying, though the then secretary general continued to refute the charges.
 
 Dramatically, Sahitya Akademi-winning author and renowned novelist Borah, resigned from the post of president following an internal rift with Rajbongshi last December, as he wanted the secretary general's ouster ahead of the Sabha's recently concluded centenary session.
