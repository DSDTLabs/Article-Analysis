Indore: The Tukoganj police on Wednesday registered a case against unidentified persons for   a 60-year-old   of Rs 60 lakh by blocking his SIM card and using net banking service two months ago. 

 The incident took place on November 15. The victim   alias  , a resident of RS Bhandari Marg, was making some transactions into his account when he lost the money.
 
 “Everything happened within a span of a few minutes between 9:48 am and 10:15am. I was making some transactions but there was some technical snag. After a few minutes when I tried to send money, there was no balance in the account,” Ravi told TOI. 
 
 Ravi said that a day before the incident the SIM card on which the account was linked got blocked. “Even after approaching the store we couldn’t get the problem fixed and we were assured by the customer service executive that it could have been because of the Aadhaar card link,” he said adding that Rs 60 lakh was transferred to six different accounts of which four were placed in Mumbai and two in Kolkata. 
 
 After this, Ravi immediately approached Tukoganj police on November 15 and bank authorities to register a case in the matter. “I got no help from the bank authorities and neither from the service provider. Even after visiting the bank several times, no answer was given,” he said. 
 
 After two months of the incident, police on Wednesday registered a case under relevant sections of the IPC and started investigation. “We are in the process of interrogating the bank officials and complainant in the matter,” said Tukoganj police station in-charge Rajkumar Yadav.
