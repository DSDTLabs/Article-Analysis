MUMBAI: The LT Marg police on Tuesday arrested a partner in a private courier company for allegedly siphoning off  . 

 While Chandrakant Baban Shinde (37), has been remanded to police custody, police are on the lookout for his partner, Amol Nimbalkar. The complainant runs Swagat Jewellers, a gold jewellery unit at Kalbadevi, and has clients in Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara. He had been supplying ornaments through Tirupati Courier, which has its office in Kalbadevi.
 
 "As the complainant had been supplying gold ornaments through Tirupati Courier since 2006, he trusted them. Tirupati Courier not only delivered the ornaments, but even got payment from his clients," said an officer. However, between September and October, 2017, Swagat Jewellers sent gold ornaments to various clients weighing nearly 2kg and worth more than Rs 47 lakh. But neither was the gold delivered nor did the payment come in. The courier company partners started avoiding the jeweller whenever he tried to contact them. They even switched off their cellphones.
