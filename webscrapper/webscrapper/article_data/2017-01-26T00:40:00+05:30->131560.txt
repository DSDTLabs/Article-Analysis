TRICHY: At a time when preparations are on in full swing to celebrate  , some of the   in the district are clueless over choosing the chief guest to hoist the tricolor.

 Usually, it is the elected representative of the local body in the rural areas who gets the privilege of hoisting the flag at the government schools in their village. However, the tenure of panchayat presidents and ward councillors had come to an end on October 24 last year. Several schools have now invited these former representatives to be the chief guest though they have no constitutional authority. 
 
 “Since the constitutional privilege for these representatives had lapsed in October 2016, in what capacity were the elected representatives called to hoist the flag,” asked social activist  . He said he had also raised the same query with the district collector  . 
 
 The headmaster of a panchayat union school in   said they had chosen to invite former chairman of the panchayat union for hoisting the flag. He contended that the school found the person previously holding the chair to be ideal to hoist the flag in the absence of freedom fighters in their village. Saying that such a situation had arisen for the first time, T Chandran, teacher of a government school in Trichy, said that it was a custom to invite the elected representative especially in rural areas. 
 
 Chief Education Officer in-charge for Trichy district, S Shanthi, said that headmaster of the respective school hoisted the tricolor on Independence Day. However, they can invite chief guest for Republic Day.
 
 The HM would decide this after consulting other teachers. It could be a freedom fighter, members of parent teachers association or a local elected representative. However, the head master can take over the job when a dispute arose over hoisting the flag, she said.
