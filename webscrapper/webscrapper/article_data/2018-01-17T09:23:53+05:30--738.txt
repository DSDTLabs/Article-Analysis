AGARTALA: The  's Tripura state committee has complained to the   that National Security Adviser (NSA)   was 'misusing his power and post in favour of  .' 

 On Tuesday, CPM state secretary Bijan Dhar alleged that central BJP leaders, including Ram Madhav (in-charge of party's affairs in North East) and senior RSS leader Krishna Gopal, had a meeting at the residence of Union home minister Rajnath Singh's house on Sunday and Doval was also present there.
 
 He said the meeting was reportedly conducted to discuss poll strategy for the comimng assembly elections in Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland where the presence of Doval is most unwarranted and unfortunate.
 
 Speaking about Doval's reported presence in the meeting, Dhar said, "The presence of Doval is not only objectionable but is a blatant misuse of the administration by the Modi government. It is a threat to the democratic system of this country. If the National Security Adviser is involved in such a highly strategic political meeting like this, many things can happen. We are really worried over the unnecessary delay in announcing the election schedule."
 
 He sought immediate action of the EC to investigate the matter and take action against Doval.
 
 Dhar also criticized the growing togetherness between India and Israel. "Following pressure from the US, the Narendra Modi government has rolled out the red carpet for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu which is against the country's long tradition. We strongly condemn the growing strategic partnership with Israel. It might be a ploy to put pressure on China, an emerging global force," said Dhar.
