Pune: The repair work of the road connecting   Phase-1 and Maan village began late on Friday evening for the benefit of   working in the Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park.

 This repair work follows the trimming of the Wipro Circle in Phase 2, another place of daily bottleneck at the IT Park. It may be followed by a widening of the stretch. A group of techies behind ‘Free Up Hinjewadi’ — a   to decongest the IT park — took had approached authorities, following which the repair work as well as trimming of the Wipro Circle was undertaken.
 
 The techies had also launched a petition on Change.org to capture the attention of the authorities towards their traffic woes. Their petition has garnered more than 4,200 supporters.
 
 Sudhir Deshmukh, one of the founding members of the campaign, said, “On Saturday, we met most of the corporators of the area to present our problems and solutions. We have already met the traffic branch officials. They have called a meeting to hear out possible solutions. We are hopeful of meeting guardian minister Girish Bapat and PMRDA chief Kiran Gitte next week.”
 
 In their appeal, the techies’ group has highlighted the impact of the prolonged commute time and the shortcomings in the infrastructure causing the daily snarls.
 
 “The infrastructure here can no longer cope with the volume of traffic. Rush hours are always a nightmare. A distance of 2.3km takes close to 40-55 minutes during rush hours and commuters have to spend 1.5-3 hours based on the origin of travel,” the petition stated.
 
 As per the petitioners, the bottlenecks at the two entry points of the IT Park — Wakad junction and Bhumkar Chowk — not only trouble daily commuters, but are also detrimental to business in the area. “They create a poor image before foreign dignitaries visiting the IT park,” they added.
