Madurai: Angry villagers ransacked a tasmac shop and destroyed several liquor bottles, near Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district late on Saturday night.

 A tasmac store along the highway at Ilayarasanendhal near Kovilpatti was closed following the Supreme Court order banning liquor outlets on highways. Following this, the officials tried to shift the shop to Pulliankulam Colony, about seven kilometers away from Kovilpatti, but the villagers opposed it.
 
 The authorities then assured the villagers that the shop would not be opened. However on Saturday night, villagers found that cases of liquor were being unloaded from a vehicle at the shop. After the vehicle left, angry villagers, including women, students, and elderly people, broke the lock and entered the shop. They destroyed several bottles before Kovilpatti West police reached the spot and stopped them. Investigations are on.
