GAYA: Creative writers discussed different aspects of the collection of   titled ‘Mulaqat’ in Gaya on Sunday evening.

 Published by a Delhi-based publication house, the stories are written by well-known fiction writer-cum-film producer Sanjay Sahay. The three-hour session was held in the Renaissance auditorium.
 
 The collection contains five stories. This is the second collection of Sahay’s stories. The first collection titled ‘Surang’ was published in 1998. ‘Surang’ contained eight stories, including ‘Seshant’. National Award-winning film Patang, featuring Shabana Azmi, Om Puri, Shatrughan Sinha and Mohan Agashe was based on ‘Seshant’.
 
 Praising Sahay’s craft of story-writing, celebrated writer Shaiwal of ‘Damul’ and ‘Mrityudand’ fame said unlike many other writers of his generation, Sahay “does not believe in 'stereo types'. Every story penned by Sahay has a different flavour and the variation experimented in the portrayal of his characters make him a class on his own,” said Shaiwal.
 
 Poet Sateyndra Kumar said Gaya has produced at least two story writers, who have acquired national stature mainly on the basis of their merit. “Before Sahay, Shaiwal established Gaya on the fiction-writing scene of the country,” he said.
 
 Dissecting Sahay's content and style, Central University of South Bihar faculty member Karmanand Arya said Sahay presented society in the ‘as is’ form and consciously avoided taking sides in the ongoing social conflict.
 
 Yogesh Kumar, another Central University of South Bihar faculty member, said that Sahay’s beauty lay in saying the unsaid and leaving things to the imagination of readers.
 
 In the question-answer session, Sahay said though he has also produced a film and directed several plays, story telling remains his favourite tool of establishing connect with the people.
