CHANDIGARH: Miffed over ad hocism and contractual arrangements in educational institutions across Haryana, the   and Haryana   said such appointments were like ‘disease’ subjecting the academia to disrepute.

 Justice Rajiv Narain Raina’s comments came while issuing guidelines regarding remuneration and working conditions of guest faculty working in various universities and colleges of Haryana. The HC has clarified that those working as guest faculty in have no right to claim equal pay for equal work, as they were paid honourarium per lecture as per   norms. Such appointees would also not be entitled to remuneration during the vacation period, the court said. Guest women employees would also be entitled to maternity benefits in terms of statutory rules, clarified the court.
 
 The HC, however, held that those appointed as assistant professor on ad hoc/temporary basis or on contract awaiting regular recruitment and employment co-terminus with availability of regular hands were entitled to basic minimum pay scale (without allowances) provided by UGC. Such appointees cannot be replaced by other temporary staff and can be replaced by a regular employee only. They will also be entitled to salary for the vacation period.
 
 The high court also advised the universities and colleges to scrap   arrangements as soon as practicable and make regular appointments without delay.
 
 The petitioners had sought directions to the alleged malpractice in the universities/colleges which relieve them before the vacations and keeps them on tenterhooks that they might not be called again.
