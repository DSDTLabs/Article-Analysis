The   Nite organised in Kanpur on Sunday turned out to be more of a ruckus night than one of entertainment. Organised at Brijendra Swarup Park, the event witnessed an unprecedented crowd of thousands gathered to hear the   season 11 contestant live. The city police had a tough time controlling the rowdy crowd during Sapna's performance. The popular Haryanavi dancer's performance was slated to start from 6pm but was delayed by an hour. Initially things went on smooth, however after three songs, the crowd gathered at the gate of the venue turned rowdy and started creating a ruckus to get inside the venue.
The police and the private security guards tried controlling the crowd but the situation soon went out of control when the crowd started pelting stones and broke down the security barricading and threw chairs. 
 Seeing the crowd go berserk, the organisers stopped the show mid-way and the bouncers near the stage provided a safe exit to Sapna and other crew members.

 Speaking on the same SSP Kanpur, Akhilesh Kumar Meena, shared, "The crowd turned unruly during the performance of Sapna Chaudhary in Kanpur. In order to maintain law and order, the police present at the venue lathi charged the crowd. The crowd dispersed after the lathi charge and the situation was brought under control. We have also registered an FIR against the organisers. The department has filed a case under sections 427 and 188 of IPC. In the initial investigations, we have also found that the organisers did not take certain permissions for organising the show." 
 We tried getting in touch with the organisers but their phones were switched off after the event. Also, Sapna Chaudhary did not respond to calls or messages.
