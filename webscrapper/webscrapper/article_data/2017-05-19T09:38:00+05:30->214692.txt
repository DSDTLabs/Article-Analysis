 Expressing his views at the inaugural session, Sriram Narayanan, chairman of CII Marathwada zonal council, said, “Proper implementation of GST would bring in transparency in the country’s indirect taxation which would in turn attract huge foreign direct investments and new job opportunities would be created.” 
 
 Narayanan said that the   would lead to rise in country’s GDP by 2% to 2.5%. He categorically mentioned that a study of CII predicted a job creation of 2.5 million for every 1% growth in GDP. “As a result of increasing GDP, overall income of every employee will increase and it will lead to better purchasing power of individual taxpayers,” he said. 
 
 Narayanan also said that a plethora of opportunities will open for small traders. He believed that that GST would lead to resolution of complex taxation system and ultimately result into more foreign direct investment. 
 
 Commenting on the apprehensions among small traders with regard to the new tax system coming into effect from July 1, Narayanan said the paradigm shift in the taxation system would result in a simplified and transparent tax regime which would be easier to administer and monitor even for small traders. 
 
 Aalhad Deshmukh, convener of the CII Marathwada Zonal Council, said, “The buying capacity of individuals would go up. The prices of various commodities are expected to come down and the buyers will have a wide range of options to choose from. It will boost the market sentiments and thus leading to an increase in the demand,” he said.
