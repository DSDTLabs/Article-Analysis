I’m on cloud nine right now. I feel so happy that all my hard work has finally paid off,” says actress  . Why wouldn’t she be, as the actress has been signed on as a lead in Ram Gopal Varma’s next multilingual project titled South, slated to have Shivarajkumar in the south versions and   in the Hindi one as the leads. “It is so surreal. He told me that he has never seen a spark in an actress like this after   in Rangeela,” adds the actress, talking about how her role in   won the maverick filmmaker over.
Talking about her debut Hindi film,   says, “The film has an edgy plot, in keeping with the style of RGV sir’s flicks, and will see my playing a don’s daughter. But she has more to her character than that and he has asked me to not to reveal it as yet.”
 After watching the film,   tweeted, “After seeing #Tagaru i signed @ManvithaHarish by giving a token advance but with a commitment that I will pay her 10 lakhs more than whatever she will demand as her final remuneration ..I also requested director   to do a film produced by me. (sic)” He watched the film at a multiplex in Bengaluru on Wednesday. He has been all praise for the film, especially to director Suri and actors   and Manvitha. 
 “I was a little late to reach the show. Suri sir, (producer) KP Sreekanth sir and Dhananjaya messaged me, asking where I was and told me that Ram Gopal Varma sir was asking for me. I thought that they were pulling my leg. On reaching there, he praised me and told me that he loved what I had done in the film and told Suri sir that I’m one of the major reasons for the film to do well,” adds Manvitha.
 Manvitha says, “RGV sir offered me a token advance. On a `2,000 note, he wrote ‘My signing amount to the most wonderful actress ever’. He asked me what I would charge for this film. I told him it would be an honour for me to just work with him. He told me he’d pay me `10 lakh more than whatever I quote.”
