KOCHI: A three-day stakeholders' meet, held as part of an Indo-UK research project, has called for setting up a system for real-time monitoring of pollution in the Vembanad Lake with the support of satellite and remote sensing technology.

 The meet is being organized by the India-UK water centre (IUKWC), a joint research project, to promote cooperation and collaboration between Indian and UK water researchers and water policy-makers.
 
 "The lake is highly polluted now. In order to curb the pollution, a real-time monitoring system should be set up so that administrative bodies could be able to save the water ecosystem in a better way," observed by a panel discussion held at the stakeholders' meet.
 
 Experts who spoke at the panel discussion said the satellite and remote sensing techniques could be made use of developing a system that sends real-time alerts whenever the waste is dumped into the lake. "The system will identify the chemicals contained in the wastes and send alerts to mobiles or any other monitoring facilities," they said.
 
 The panel also proposed that a smart irrigation system incorporated with latest technologies should replace the existing irrigation system in India that causes water losses. "New technologies should be introduced to improve the water supply system in the country. There is a need to translate the modern technologies into the local people's versions," it proposed.
 
 The panel discussion also proposed to bring science closer to the people and to use the science to solve people's problems. 
 
 IUKWC project is coordinated by the ministry of earth science and the natural environment research council, UK.
 
 "Under the IUKWC project, a study will be conducted to understand the risk to public health due to the pollution in the lake ecosystem. It will examine how pollution affects health of the people, causes loss of revenue and lower quality of life, threatening orderly and sustainable economic development of the region.
