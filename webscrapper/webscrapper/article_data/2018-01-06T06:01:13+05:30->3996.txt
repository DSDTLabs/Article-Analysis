NEW YORK:   says his “personal challenge” for 2018 is to fix Facebook. The   CEO has declared a goal each year since 2009. Past challenges have included wearing a tie every day, learning to speak Mandarin and eating meat only from animals he killed himself. Last year, he visited every US state he hadn’t been to yet.

 This year, though, his challenge is directed at his company rather than personal ambitions. “The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do,” Zuckerberg, at 33 one of the world’s wealthiest people, wrote in a post on the No 1social media network.
 
 This year, his post described Facebook as standing at a crossroads that required his attention. He cited the spread of hate speech on social media, use of Facebook by   and other countries to disseminate propaganda and criticism that the platform can be an addictive waste of time.
 
 A new law in   requires social networks such as Facebook and   to remove online hate speech or face fines. In the US, lawmakers have criticised Facebook for failing to prevent Russian operatives from using its platform to meddle in the 2016 US elections. In addition, ex-Facebook executives have publicly questioned whether using the network leads to unhealthy behaviours.
 
 Zuckerberg said his “personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing these important issues and making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent.”He added that the pledge “may not seem like a personal challenge on its face,” but that he would learn a lot. He did not say what he would do. He added that while Facebook won’t prevent all mistakes or abuse, “we currently make too many errors.”
