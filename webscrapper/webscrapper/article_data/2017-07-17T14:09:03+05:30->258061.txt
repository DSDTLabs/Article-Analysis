YAVATMAL: The process of land acquisition for laying a new railway line between Wardha and Nanded via Yavatmal seems to be heading nowhere with the officials paying no heed to the directives union railway minister   gave at a review meeting with top bureaucrats in New Delhi in April to complete the work by June 30.

 Following this, district collector Sachindra Pratap Singh had issued letters and instructed sub-divisional officers (SDOs) to expedite land acquisition process. But barring land acquisition officer of Kalamb and Yavatmal  , his counterparts in Darwha, Digras, Pusad and Umarkhed tehsils appeared to have not made any progress on this front that may delay the project. The new railway line is all the more important as it would ensure fast development of the suicide-prone district.
 
 Bhakre said that he had completed almost all the land acquisition work for phase-I in a record time. He however said that he was being transferred to  .
 
 Enquiries revealed that land acquisition beyond Yavatmal tehsil is almost ‘zero’ which indicates that the laying the railway line would take a lot of time.
 
 When contacted, the Yavatmal-Kalamb LAO Vijay Bhakre said that he has completed almost all the land acquisition work of phase-I in a record breaking time frame in an innovative and pro active manner to ensure the cooperation of the farmers.
 
 “Now I am being transferred to Bhandara and is expecting to get relieved from the post soon,” Bhakare said, adding that the railway has floated tender for 40 kms line with railway testing up to Yavatmal by 2019 but declined to comment on the status of the land acquisition beyond his jurisdiction.
 
 Enquiries revealed that the land acquisition beyond Yavatmal tehsil is almost ‘zero’ per cent which indicates that the railway line is set to linger indefinitely.
