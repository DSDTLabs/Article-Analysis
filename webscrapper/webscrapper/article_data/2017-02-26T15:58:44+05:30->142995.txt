 says he is influenced by American films, so a song-and-dance routine neither appeals to him as a film watcher nor as a filmmaker. And forcing such commercial elements in his debut film, Shuddhi, which is based on a serious subject, wasn't something that he was ready to do. 'We just couldn't add commercial elements to the film as it doesn't fit the story. If I had to compare   with another film, it would be The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo ' an Indian comparison would be Kahaani,' says Adarsh.

 The movie will, however, have one song, which will be played over the end credits. 'The movie is a suspense thriller, and Goddess Durga is a major theme. So, we chose to remix a popular devotional song on Durga. Nobin Paul (who gave the background score for  ) has remixed the song and has done a very good job ' it's a hard-hitting number,' the director adds. The makers plan on revealing the song online a couple of weeks before the release.
 
 The visuals that audiences will see when the song plays are also interesting. 'The end credits will show glimpses of the making process of the film. Usually, makers choose to show bloopers, but we will show the effort that went in to bring out the film onscreen,' says Adarsh.
