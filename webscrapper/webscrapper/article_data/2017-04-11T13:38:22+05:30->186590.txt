GANDHINAGAR: After enacting the stringent new cow protection law, the   BJP government plans to launch cow-oriented startups, aiming to promote cow-based industry in the state.

 These will conduction activities ranging from professional cow rearing to sale of products like cow milk, ghee, gau mutra, arak, chaan, medicines, beauty cream etc. The startups will focus on branding cow products through new mediums.
 
 
  
 
 The Gau Seva Aayog is starting a statewide consultation with chambers of commerce, industry associations and major companies, to support cow-based startups. The Gujarat government will also form a special venture fund.
 
 Dr Vallabh Kathiriya, chairman of Gau Seva Aayog said, “There is huge scope for cow rearing and making cow-based products commercially successful, thus providing jobs to thousands of people. So far it has not been promoted in this way. We have decided to promote cow-based startups and PM Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” scheme. Soon we will invite top industrialists, chambers of commerce, various industrial associations, especially the   association, to make the cow-based startups a grand success. From professional cow rearing to selling cow products like cow milk, ghee, gau mutra, arak, chaan, medicines, beauty cream etc. The startups will focus on branding of cow products through new mediums.”
 
 “There is ample scope for such startups in rural and semi-urban areas as well as for selling cow-based products online and offline in major cities. We hope to involve women’s groups who are involved in cow rearing,” he added.
 
 The aayog is also planning a statewide “Gau Sant Samellan” (gathering of saints), to raise awareness about the new cow protection law and to promote cow-based economic and conservation activities.
 
 The   is reportedly planning a “Gau Raksha Jan Jagruti Yatra” across the state, to popularize the new law and woo Hindu voters.
