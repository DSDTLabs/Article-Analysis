He added that district magistrate of West Tripura Milind Ramteke has conducted an investigation and filed a detailed report to the government.
 
 State BJP president Biplab Kumar Deb, however, said the TMC party was not involved in the attack on its leader but that Sandeep Roy Barman, TMC MLA Sudip Roy Barman's elder brother, is the one to blame. Deb claimed Roy Barman did this under "instructions from CPM". BJP reacted to the situation and went to the police, seeking justice against Roy Barman. In the meantime, TMC got involved and pelted stones at BJP workers in the presence of police forces for two hours, Deb added.
 
 Both TMC and BJP have been separately accusing ruling CPM of having allowed the incident to escalate by asking police to stand down and letting the two groups clash. 
 
 CPM has denied having any involvement in the incident and said both parties are two sides of the same coin - always associated with criminal activities and terrorising the state. CPM held a protest rally on Wednesday evening in the city, urging people to defy both parties.
