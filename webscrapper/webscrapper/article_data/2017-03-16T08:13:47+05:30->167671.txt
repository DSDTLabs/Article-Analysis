KOCHI: Architect Bijoy Jain, recipient of Global Award for Sustainable Architecture said that the artworks on display here double as documentation on the state of mankind.

 “The artworks all carry within them something enduring and this enables a sort of real-time documentation of our state of being or the current state of where we are as inhabitants and inheritors of this universe,“ said Jain, who was a participating artist in the second edition of KMB. “The Biennale is a whole universe of different thoughts, actions and movements that are very much rooted in the idea of contemporary art culture. I absorbed so much over my visit that I would need quite a bit of time to process what I have experienced here,“ he added.
 
 The Mumbai-based architect also expressed his appre ciation for the spirit of inclusivity in curator  's vision for the Biennale, contending that the diversity of artworks, styles and forms on display made this edition of the Biennale “very special“.
 
 “What stood out for me is  's Children of Unquiet, a video about a group of young boys from So uthern England rapping. The line-drawings in the Secret Dialogues series by C Bhagyanath was excellent and Where the flowers still grow, the photo exhibition by   on Kashmir, had a poetic, poignant quality,“ said Jain, who is also a visiting professor of architecture at   in the US.
 
 Accompanying Jain on the private visit was South Indian film actress  , who said she would take home some intriguing, images and interpretations of contemporary expression.
 
 “This edition of KMB has introduced me to some artists who were unknown to me and also to some new forms of contemporary expressions. K R Sunil's photo series Vanishing Life-Worlds, which peeks into the life and culture of people from Ponnani, is visual poetry,“ said Menon.
