Varanasi: Joining the bandwagon of senior Congressmen and other political leaders, Congress candidate Rajesh Mishra, who lost to BJP candidate Neelkanth Tiwari from Varanasi South seat, accused the BJP of EVM rigging in UP Assembly elections. He alleged that the BJP leadership, using their clout, instructed the men concerned for   and demanded a fair probe into the programming of EVMs.

 Talking to reporters here on Wednesday, Mishra alleged that sensing unfavourable mood of people during poll campaign the BJP influenced the poll results by tampering EVMs. “Fearing defeat, the BJP leadership used their influence to tamper the EVMs by the men engaged in maintenance of the EVMs,” he said adding that the men engaged in maintenance of EVMs are solely accountable to the manufacturing companies. 
 
 He further said that the EVMs are fully computerised and run by specific programming. “No other person is aware of the operation and programming of these machines. In such a situation we demand Election Commission to ensure examination of EVM programming by other competent companies to bring the truth to the fore”, he added.
 
 Mishra is senior vice president of UPCC and former MP from Varanasi. In a tough contest with BJP candidate he lost the election by a margin of over 17,000 votes. Not only Mishra, but two other Congress candidates Anil Srivastava from Varanasi Cantt and Abdul Samad Ansari from Varanasi North also lost to BJP candidates. Other leaders like BSP supremo Mayawati and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal have already raised the issue of EVM tampering.
