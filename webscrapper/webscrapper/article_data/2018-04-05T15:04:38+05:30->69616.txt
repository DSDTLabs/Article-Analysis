 Justin Bieber has said he is proud of his tattoos and does not regret any of them. 

  
  
 The 24-year-old   took to   where he shared a picture of his back full of body art, saying getting tattoos is not everyone's cup of tea. 
 
 
  
  
 "If tattooed didn't hurt everyone would have them. Well maybe not (e)very one!! Over a hundred hours of hart(d) work on my body and I wouldn't take back a single one. 
 
 "I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ART AND I'VE MADE my body a canvas and it's SO MUCH FUN (sic)" Bieber wrote alongside the photograph. 
 
 The 'Believe' hitmaker previously had a tattoo of his on/off girlfriend singer   on his arm, which he later tried to cover up after they broke up.
