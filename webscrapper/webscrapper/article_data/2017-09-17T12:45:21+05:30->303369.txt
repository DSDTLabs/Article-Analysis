INDORE: Reaping the benefits of the digital era and social media platforms, Indore police have gone a step ahead and started WhatsApp attendance for beat officials.

 In order to decrease travel timings for beat officials and to increase their productivity, DIG Harinarayanachari   has started a new attendance system under which the officials will no longer have to travel to the control room to sign and register their attendance.
 
 They can simply send their WhatsApp location on the beat group to the seniors.
 
 Supervisory police officers can police their own men when they step out to protect the city in the wee hours.
 
 Due to a sudden spurt in serious crimes like thefts and break-ins, night patrol policemen have been assigned specific stretches. However, beat police officials were facing problems in reporting at the spot as they had to first reach the police control room to sign the register.
 
 After completing their duties, the constables were supposed to reach the control room again to sign out.
 
 “This was a complete waste of time as the duty officials had to travel long distances to just sign the register,” said an assistant sub inspector. He added that he knew a sub-inspector who lived in   and had to travel to the SP’s office to sign the register and then again to   for duty.
 
 The move garnered desired results and policemen, who were in the habit of skipping their duties in the wee hours, can now be checked.
 
 DIG Mishra said, “Apart from technology, physical checking is also important and hence I remain on the field even late at night. Technology complements our work and must be used to improve productivity.”
