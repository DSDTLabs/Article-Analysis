Actress   said she has decided to stop eating meat as she is an animal lover.

  
  
 "Becoming a vegetarian has been a thought that crossed my mind a lot of times in the last few years. One day, I was randomly scrolling through   videos just out of my love and concern for dogs. 
 
 "And I happened to come across some videos that really bothered me. I couldn't even watch the end and I can't claim to be an animal lover if I did not do my bit. So I stopped," Ishita said in a statement.
 
 Was it difficult to give up her food habits?
 
 "It hasn't been as difficult as people would expect it to be and not as easy as it is a major lifestyle change. Maybe looking at the bigger picture, things seem easier," she said.
 
 On the work front, Ishita will soon be seen in a movie which will mark the debut of actress  's nephew  .
