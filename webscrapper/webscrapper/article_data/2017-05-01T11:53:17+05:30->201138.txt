PANAJI: Taking a dig at Congress,   Party on Sunday said that its doors are open for all disgruntled   members.

 “Trajano D’Mello gets debarred from Congress for six years because he spoke the truth. He took up two major issues; Serula comunidade and the EDM festivals in Goa and took them to their logical conclusion.   has also been removed as the Goa in- charge as he was one of the votaries of a pre-poll alliance with Goa Forward. We call all such people, who have been removed from their posts to join our ranks,” party spokesperson   said, adding that no formal communication has been sent to any Congress member.
