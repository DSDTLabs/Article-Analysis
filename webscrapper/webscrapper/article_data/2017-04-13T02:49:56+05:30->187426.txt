GURUGRAM: The Haryana government is all set to open around half a dozen   across state for children belonging to denotified nomadic and semi-nomadic Tribes (DNT). 

 The idea is to provide opportunities and make these tribes part of the mainsteam society. A development board has also been formed in Haryana to look into the uplift of DNTs and remove the social stigma associated with them.
 
 The DNTs were originally believed to be “addicted to the systematic commission of non-bailable offences” and were thus listed under the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871. 
 
 Later, the act was replaced by Habitual Offenders Act 1952. This stigma still haunts the 26 castes from Haryana that are included in the DNTs. Around 19 lakh people from Gadia Lohar (ironsmith), Baazigar (acrobats), Chidimaar, Saansi, Kanjar, Perna, Nayak, Oad, Bawaria, etc currently live in Haryana.
 
 A nine-member Haryana Denotified, Nomadic and   has been formed by the government for the uplift of DNTs. Six new hostels will be established where the children from DNTs will get free education and boarding. Around 50 boys are expected to be enrolled between class five and twelve. The announcement for the same was made in Gurgaon on Tuesday. The hostels will be set up in Hisar, Sirsa, Fatehabad, Faridabad, Ambala and Karnal. Apart from these the existing hostels in Jind and Yamunagar will soon be shifted to a bigger facility. Besides, a boarding school will be started in Gurgaon by next year, once the land is identified for the same.
 
 “Also, we will organise camps to make ration cards for these tribes and also we will initiate programmes to rehabilitate them around the same areas where they are currently living,” said Dr  , chairman of the Haryana Denotified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes Development Board.
