A mob went berserk after an eight-year-old accident victim was declared dead by doctors at the Trimbakeshwar rural hospital near Nashik on Tuesday night. 

 Demanding the immediate arrest of the driver of the car involved in the accident, the mob allegedly manhandled doctors and policemen besides ransacking the hospital.
 
 Around 30 people have been booked on charges of rioting, damage to public property and assaulting public servants. Six suspects, who were part of the mob, have been identified.
