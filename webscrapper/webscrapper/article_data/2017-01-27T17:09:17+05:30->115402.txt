 seems to be bagging top projects in the Telugu industry as well. In the upcoming Tollywood film Mahanati, which is to be directed by Nag Ashwin and scripted by Sai Madhav, Keerthy plays the role of the legendary South Indian actress and National Award winner Savitri.

 The film's scriptwriter Sai Madhav says, 'We will start the film's shoot around February - March, this year. It will be a biopic and we are not taking cinematic liberties which would tamper with her actual life story.' Savitri had acted in films across the South and in Bollywood. She debuted in Malayalam in 1973 through the film Chuzhi, directed by Triprayar Sukumaran.
 
 According to sources, Nithya Menen was first approached for the role in the biopic and later, Samantha too was considered for it. Though Samantha didn't take up Savitri's role, she is also part of the project and is playing a pivotal character in the film.
 
 When asked why Keerthy was chosen for the role, Sai Madhav says, 'It is completely the director's decision, however, I would say that she is the actress who is apt to play the role of Savitri.'
