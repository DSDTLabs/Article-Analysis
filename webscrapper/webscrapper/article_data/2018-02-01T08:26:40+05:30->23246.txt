LUCKNOW: In a surprising move, deputy chief minister   has taken over as the chairman of UP Rajkya Nirman Nigam ( ), removing principal secretary, PWD, Sadakant, who was holding the post. Before Maurya took over the charge, Sadakant was downgraded as the vice-chairman just a week before his retirement on January 31.

 Thus Maurya, apart from having powerful portfolio of PWD, has two big corporations UPRNN and the UP State Bridge Corporation (UPSBC) under him. Noother PWD minister before him has enjoyed this status. Both the UPRNN and the   handle major construction contracts and projects to the tune of thousands of crores, even outide UP and India. This is first time that the PWD minister has become the UPRNN chairman since its inception. Even some powerful PWD ministers in the past—   and   — did not assume the charge and nominated the department’s principal secretary. This, in fact, always was the tradition that principal secretary, PWD, would assume thecharge of UPRNN chairman. Traditionally, it is the department’s principal secretary who is nominated as the chairman of UPRNN.
 
 While Maurya has assumed the total controlof UPRNN, its performance this year has dipped — from Rs 5,400 by March 2017 to Rs 3,500 crore now. Not only this, during a review meeting of the UPRNN chief minister Yogi Adityanath expressed his displeasure over the slow progress in the Centrally funded five medical colleges being constructed by the UPRNN in five places Shahjahanpur, Ferozabad , Basti, Behraich and Faizabad.
 
 The CMhad alsotaken note of the fact that 60% time has passed while not even 35% of the work in the five medical colleges has been completed. Yogi had earlier expressed his displeasure over failure of the department in making the roads pothole-free, causing embarrassment totheBJP government.
