LUCKNOW: Hitting out at Prime Minister   for raincoat remarks at former PM Manmohan Singh, Congress vice-president   said the PM likes peeping into people’s bathrooms and searching Google but has done nothing for the welfare of poor and needy.

 On Modi’s recent barb that Congress leaders should “hold their tongue” as he has their entire ‘janampatri’ (horoscope), Rahul said the PM has been in office for two-and-a-half years but could not corner the Congress. “He (PM) has not been able to come up with anything from that janampatri in the past two-and-a-half years since he has been in power,” Rahul told reporters after releasing the SP-Congress alliance’s common minimum programme.
 
 Terming Modi’s remarks as a tactic to divert attention from issues related to people’s welfare, Rahul said these were signs of nervousness as Modi is wary of UP poll results and knows that they will dent his image.
 
 “Modiji likes to peep into people’s bathrooms and search Google. He can do that in his free time. But he should also talk about what has to done for the people as PM,” Rahul said. “He is a failure as a PM,” Congress vice-president said, adding that the PM had promised two crore jobs annually but offered employment to only one lakh people last year.
 
 “Our PM has waived loans worth Rs 1,40,000 crore of a select few. He could have given some relief to farmers as well,” Rahul said. The NDA government hyped the surgical strikes but is mum on the fact that the security forces have suffered maximum causalities in Jammu and Kashmir during its rule, he added.
 
 Dwelling on the key priorities of the SP-Congress alliance, he said the Congress is for a government which is headed by youth and has a vision to usher UP into a new era where welfare of farmers, uplift of poor and overall development are the main objectives.
