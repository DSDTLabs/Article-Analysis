CHANDIGARH: Digital data cards which DAV College, Sector 10, issued to its students at the start of this academic session will finally be put to test in the next few days. The college is expected to finish installing two machines for   and identifying students to whom they have been issued to. 

 According to the college, barcodes printed on the cards already carry information about a student's admission, hostel, and other details.
 
 The scanning machines will be installed on the gate of the college library and the hostel gate to capture the entry and exit information of the students. The machines are expected to be installed in the next ten days.
 
 The two machines are priced at Rs 2 lakh each, along with scanners which cost Rs 15,000 each. The college received a grant of Rs 2 crore under the Central Government's RUSA (Rashtriya Ucchatar Shiksha Abhiyan) scheme used for providing strategic funding to eligible state higher educational institutions, according to Dr  , RUSA co-ordinator, DAV College, Sector 10. "The barcode-scanning software will enable usto record the attendance of college students. When they enter the library, they will use the barode-bearing smart ID card to enter from the gate. At the same time, the same machines will be attached to the hostel and mess entrance door of the girl's hostel after the testing phase. The same will possibly be replicated in the boys' hostel and its mess," said  , public relations officer, DAV College. 
 
 The barcode-enabled ID cards will also be useful in determining an input and output pattern of a student, which will help the college management to understand the wherabouts of the student. "The roll number of a student can be traced from this mechanism and a new report can be generated about any student just by merely putting the ID card before the  ," added Taneja.
