BENGALURU: As   into the ground to quench parched throats in  , water has become more   due to the increasing  . To compensate for the delay in the  , the government has mooted a Rs 2,160 crore project to draw 1.67 thousand million cubic feet of water from the backwaters of the Tungabhadra.

 The government is alreadly supplying water drawn from other parts of the district in tankers. As a long-term solution, the government is banking on the Yettinahole project to lift water from Netravathi and supply it to Tumakuru and other districts. The project has run into legal and political tangles, leaving Pavagada and other taluks to deal with the fluoride-contaminated groundwater and successive droughts.“Even if the project becomes a reality, our taluk will be one of the last beneficiaries so we are trying to add the taluk to other projects to ensure there is sufficient drinking water,“said water resources department official said.
 
 Law minister T B Jayachandra said: “With the extreme situation in Pavagada, where the fluoride content in groundwater has created shortage of drinking water, we had to think of an alternative.As a result, we are drawing 1.67 thousand million cubic feet of water from Tungabhadra backwaters.“
 
 Jayachandra said apart from Pavagada, the other ta luks that will benefit from this project are Kunigal (Tumakuru), Molkalmuru (Chitradurga) and Holalkere (Chitradurga). Two cases, one questioning the forest clearances and the other its merits by people from Dakshina Kannada, are still pending before the National Green Tribunal (NGT).
 
 Sources said the government is trying to push the project without repercussion from the NGT or the political hotbed of DK. The department is in the process of rushing through the lift portion of the project and is calling tenders for the initial 200km of the conveyance part of the project.
