GURUGRAM: A junior resident doctor, a staff nurse and an ambulance staff are likely to face harsh action, even termination, in the case of medical negligence at  , where a delay in admission forced a woman to deliver in a cycle stand near the emergency ward last Friday.

 The doctor, Dr Mohini, who was on duty when the 25-year-old woman in labour was brought to the emergency ward, and the staff nurse, Savita, who took the woman to get an ultrasound test done, have already been suspended. The district health department had taken the action after preliminary probe for denying an immediate admission to the woman and sending her for a test that was not crucial at that moment. Also, she was denied the test for the want of an   card.
 
 Sources said a two-member team, which is said to have completed its probe in the matter, had found the two guilty of negligence. And both the doctor and the nurse were likely to face strict action, they added.
 
 The team, comprising Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj and Dr VK Bansal from the state health department, is likely to submit its report on Thursday.
 
 Apart from these two, emergency medical technician (EMT) Manoj, who had brought the woman and her husband to the hospital in an ambulance, might also face termination. Sources said he had dropped the woman on the hospital courtyard, instead of taking her to the emergency ward. Also, Dr Pawan Chaudhary, a resident medical officer, who was in-charge of the emergency ward, would be given a warning. “Dr Chaudhary is responsible for whatever happens in his ward,” said a senior health officer.
 
 The team had visited the hospital in   on Saturday and checked   footage, hospital registers and recorded the statements of the patient and hospital staff.
 
 Senior officers claimed that during the visit, the team also quizzed Dr Pradeep Sharma, principal medical officer, Gurgaon, on the Aadhaar card fiasco.
