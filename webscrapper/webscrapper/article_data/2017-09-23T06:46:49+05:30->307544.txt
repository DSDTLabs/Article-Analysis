HYDERABAD: Commuters battling the   menace along the Nalgonda Cross Road in   Circle, for years, could finally heave a sigh of relief. For, the   ( ) is in the process of laying a storm water pipeline, through underground tunnelling. The total cost of the work is pegged at `15.70 lakh.

 Unlike the regular process followed while laying a pipeline, the underground tunnelling technique does not involve digging of the surface road. Instead, a passage is dug up from a surrounding area to reach the site of work.
 
 “The reason we opted for underground tunnelling here is because this stretch witnesses heavy footfall. Hence, digging the road for restoration works would lead to unmanageable traffic snarls,“ said Srinivas Reddy , zonal commissioner (south zone), GHMC.
 
 Also, officials claimed, extra attention has been paid to the quality of construction material being used for the project. “We have used the best quality pipeline with a width of one metre. This will ensure it can withstand more water inflow compared to regular pipes,“ said Md Ghouse Mohiuddin, executive engineer of Malakpet Circle.
 
 The work is expected to be completed by September 30.
 
 “This stretch has been a critical waterlogging point for a very long time. After every spell of rainfall this entire area gets inundated causing much inconvenience to residents living in the vicinity .So, we decided to finally inspect the site and take up the restoration work,“ said a senior GHMC official attributing the problem to a damaged storm water drain that's currently in use in the area.“The pipe was damaged during construction of the metro track,“ the official added.
