Mechanical engineer Suneet Jain joined Chrysalis Entrepreneur Forum from India to smash the   for the   with an astounding 182 scuba divers in Koh Tao, Thailand. The record was earlier held by 173 Italian divers.

 The record attempt was planned with Absolute Scuba (India) and took place at Coral Grand Resort, Sairee Beach, Koh Tao. The total length of the human chain was 140 metres.
 
 The team included more than 30 non-swimmers, several first-time scuba divers and all age groups from 8-year-olds to 58-year-olds. They collectively overcame several challenges including recruiting and training over 200 participants, scouting for a suitable location internationally and organising a large-scale   event in a foreign country. Unfamiliar with saltwater, the team failed their practice attempt the previous day after six months of planning. Overnight, they dropped and replaced several divers and created a winning dive plan to set this spectacular record, demonstrating their belief that 'impossible is nothing!' The overarching goal of this event was to inspire ordinary people to extraordinary accomplishments. 
 
 24-year-old Suneet plans to use his engineering skills for his next Guinness world record. He has a few ideas and is already working out their feasibility.
