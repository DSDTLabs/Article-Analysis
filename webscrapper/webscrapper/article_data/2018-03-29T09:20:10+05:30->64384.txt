VARANASI: Banaras Hindu University's (BHU) newly appointed vice-chancellor   said that if having a students union was the answer to all problems then all issues of   would have been solved long back. Before taking over as the university's VC, Bhatnagar was a professor at JNU. 

 Bhatnagar interacted with media in the city for the first time after assuming charge on Wednesday.
 
 While answering a question on whether the students' union could be restored at BHU, Bhatnagar said, "It is wrong to think that a students union is mandatory to find solutions for all problem of students. It depends on how honestly students want to solve the problems. If a students union was so effective in solving problems of students, then there would not have been any problems in JNU."
 
 Talking about internal lobbies existing in university, the VC said, "Being a bio-technologist, I am able to handle invisible challenges. Like Prime Minister  , who is often accused of many things, chooses to work for the future rather than reacting to such accusations, I will also work by learning a lesson from past."
 
 He added that he would focus on bringing students, faculty, academicians and administrative officers together to look for solutions for problems being faced by the university. 
 
 Bhatnagar is the 27th VC of BHU and takes over after the post of BHU vice-chancellor was lying vacant for past five months. His predecessor GC Tripathi retired a month before his scheduled retirement following the campus violence, wherein girl students were cane-charged by police on September 23, 2017. The students were staging a protest after a girl was sexually harassed on campus on September 21, 2017.
 
 BHU had also remained in the eye of the storm over the issue of appointments of academicians and death of patients at Sir   hospital June, 2017. BHU VC said that improvement in academic atmosphere, promoting job-oriented courses and scientific works were among his priorities.
