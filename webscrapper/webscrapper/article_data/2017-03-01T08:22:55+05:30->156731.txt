BENGALURU: A 36-year-old engineer, who lost his job five years ago, smothered his wife and two-year-old daughter to death before hanging himself at his home in  , northeast Bengaluru, on Monday.

 The incident came to light on Monday night when Sukanya, a non-teaching staff at the daycare centre managed by the wife, alerted police.
 
 The bodies of  , wife Meenakshi and daughter Manya, from  , were found in different rooms. While Manya's body was in the bedroom, Meenakshi's near the kitchen, and Amit had hanged himself in the hall. Police suspect Amit, a BTech graduate, gave his wife and daughter food laced with poison and smothered them.
 
 “There was froth near their mouth. The post-mortem will reveal details of the murders,“ an officer said.
 
 “The Patna family had come to Bengaluru in 2005. Amit lost his job in 2009 over a personal issue. Since then, he had taken to drink and the couple would fight often," a police officer said.
 
 In 2013, Meenakshi opened a daycare centre for kids near the Yelahanka New Town bus stop. A police officer said, “On Monday evening, Sukanya panicked when Meenakshi didn't turn up at the daycare centre. When she didn't take any calls, Sukanya rushed to the house. She looked through the window and screamed on seeing Amit's body.“
 
 On Sunday afternoon, Meenakshi had texted a friend that the family was in a financial mess and wanted to sell a site they owned. Cops said the cellphones of the husband and wife showed no activity since Sunday and are exploring the possibility of the murder-suicide happening that night itself.
