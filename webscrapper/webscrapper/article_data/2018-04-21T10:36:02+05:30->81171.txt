LUCKNOW: In an effort to make land available for new investors in the state, especially those who signed MoUs with the government during the UP Investors' Summit in February this year, Uttar   ( ) has started the process of taking back land previously allocated for industrial use that has been lying unutilised. 

 Directions have also been issued to ensure that within 30 days of recovering such land, it should be reallocated to those who signed MoUs with the government during the summit.
 
 UPSIDC managing director   said that so far 987 plots totalling 364 acres have been taken back from those who had failed to start any activity on this land against the stipulated timeline under the conditions of land allocation. While the process to take back more such land is underway, a deadline of April 30, 2018, has been set for initiating the process to take back all such land. In a meeting with the   and   and other senior officials of the department held recently, it was decided that allottees who were given land for less than five years and who require an extension will have to make necessary payments to UPSIDC before any extension can be allowed to them. 
 
 Similarly, allottees who were given land more than five years back and who applied for extension to fulfil their commitments before December 31, 2017, will have to deposit necessary fees before the deadline prescribed for individual cases. If they fail to meet this deadline, they are not to be permitted any further extensions and their land will be taken back.
 
 UPSIDC has been set a target of allocating a minimum of 1,000 acres land for the purpose of setting up industries and a financial target of Rs 900 crore for the current financial year 2018-19.
 
 Meanwhile, 40 projects, for which MoUs were signed during the Investors' Summit, have been identified and regional managers of UPSIDC have been told to follow up for each and offer help in setting up the units or industries.
