NEW DELHI: There’s a Guinness World Record possibility here: three courts together penned judgments running into 2,625 pages in the 21-year-old   against J  , N  , V N Sudhakaran and  .

 Trial judge Michael D’Cunha convicted all four and sentenced them to four years’ imprisonment through a 1,136-page judgment that was upheld on Tuesday by a   bench comprising Justices   and Amitava Roy.
 
 Justices Ghose and Roy together wrote 563 pages in convicting and sentencing Sasikala and the two others as the case against Jayalalithaa abated with her death. 
 
 The page count went up to 570 with Justice Roy supplementing the main judgment with seven pages of judicial angst on the spread of corruption.
 
 While upholding the trial court verdict, the SC set aside the 919-page judgment authored by Justice C R Kumaraswamy of the Karnataka high court, which had acquitted all four. 
 
 The volume was not lost on the SC bench. At 10.32 am, when the court staff opened a thick packet and drew out the judgment to hand it over to Justice Ghose for pronouncement of the verdict, it drew exclamations from the packed courtroom. 
 
 With his characteristic disarming smile, Justice Ghose said, “You can see it is a fatty judgment. But we have discharged the burden cast on us through this case.”
