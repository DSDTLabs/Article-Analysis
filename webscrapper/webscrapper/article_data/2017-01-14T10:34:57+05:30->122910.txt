PATNA: Kite lovers in the state capital will have a gala time for four days as the sixth edition of the annual Patna   will kick off at   diara on the occasion of Makar Sankranti on Saturday.

 The   (BSTDC) has roped in professional kite flyers from Delhi and at least 300 kites and spindles will be given to the visitors for free. People can also go for rides on two camels brought by the corporation during the four-day fest. Besides, cultural events will be organised in which local artists will regale the revellers.
 
 “The kite fest will be organised between 10am and 5pm on all four days. A large area has been earmarked and getting barricaded for flying kites. Various other facilities like bamboo huts, food courts, open canopy lounges with a capacity of at least 20 people and river view benches are also being developed for the visitors. They can also enjoy different delicacies at the food courts,” said a senior BSTDC official on Friday, adding a special cleanliness drive would also be undertaken in the diara area.
 
 The BSTDC will also put its two boats - MV Ganga Vihar and MV Kautilya - into service during the kite fest for ferrying revellers from the   to the Sabbalpur Diara for free. While MV Ganga Vihar has a floating capacity of around 50 people, MV Kautilya has a capacity to accommodate 30 people. As far as security is concerned, the Patna police will ensure that anti-social elements remain at bay. Smoking and drinking will be strictly prohibited.
 
 The first kite festival in 2011 was a two-day event - January 14 and 15 - and was inaugurated by chief minister Nitish Kumar.
