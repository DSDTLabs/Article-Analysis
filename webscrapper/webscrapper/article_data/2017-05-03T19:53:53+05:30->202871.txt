THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: He's a fulltime politician, she an independent-minded career bureaucrat, an unlikely romance in the best of circumstances, but Congress   and   Divya S Iyer surely seem made for each other.

 The rumour mills had been working overtime for a while and on Tuesday, Sabarinadhan finally mentioned his relationship status on Facebook as ‘committed’. Alongside a picture of the beaming couple, Sabarinadhan posted, “I am getting questions from dear ones about my marriage for a while. Now I am happily announcing it. I met sub collector Dr   at Thiruvananthapuram. When we became close, we learned that our ideas, interests and perspectives are similar. With the love and blessings of both families, Divya will soon join me as my partner. We expect all your blessings”.
 
 A visibly excited Divya told reporters that she couldn’t remember the precedence of a politician marrying an IAS officer. “We need blessings of all”, she said. The wedding is likely to take place next month.
 
 Interestingly, 33-year old Sabarinadhan takes after his father, former speaker and late Congress stalwart G Karthikeyan. Karthikeyan courted M T Sulekha, Sabarinadhan’s mother, when he was a rising star in Kerala politics and she a college professor. Their families opposed the romance, and Sulekha eventually eloped with Karthikeyan. Later, their romance and marriage was the subject of the Mammooty-starrer Nayam Vyakthamakkunnu. 
 
 With Sabarinadhan and Divya, however, both families wholeheartedly support them. Both of them are residents of Thiruvananthapuram. An MBA graduate, Sabarinadhan was with Tata Trust before joining politics following the death of his father. He won from Aruvikkara in the by-election in 2015 and retained the seat in the 2016 assembly election.
 
 Divya, 32, is a graduate in medicine from CMC Vellore. She got into IAS in 2013. She has previously worked as assistant collector at Kottayam before moving to home district as sub collector.
