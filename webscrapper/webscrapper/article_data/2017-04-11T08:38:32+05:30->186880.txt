LUCKNOW:   in one sitting is an issue of the Sunni community, hence Shia clerics and Shia organisations should stay out of the matter, Maulana  , general secretary of the  , said here on Monday.

 A meeting of the national level body of Shia clerics was attended by members from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Bengal, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Jammu & Kashmir, Kargil, Lucknow and other parts of Uttar Pradesh.
 
 The body said Shia religious leaders jumping the gun to the demand strict law against triple talaq in one sitting should not meddle into the matter of the Sunni community. As for the rights of Sunni women being oppressed under the “un-Islamic” practice, the body said it was for Sunni clerics to resolve the issue.
 
 “Those jumping into the campaign are doing so only to serve their political motives and to create a Shia-Sunni rift,” said Jawad. “We have no right to force our opinion on the community when we have no stake, and for   the practice is any way illegitimate,” he added.
 
 On Babri Masjid, Jawad said the dispute should be resolved through talks. “But that can happen only when all sides sacrifice,” he said.
 
 On the row over illegal slaughterhouses being shut down in the state, Jawad blamed the previous   government for not renewing licences on time. “The government that was known as ‘thekedaar’ of Muslims should be held responsible for all the chaos and asked why it failed to renew licences in the last five years. As for butchers facing crisis, they should be given time for the renewal process,” he said.
 
 On being asked about the Shia Gau Raksha Dal formed recently by Jawad’s cousin, the cleric said hooliganism in the name of cow protection should not be accepted.
