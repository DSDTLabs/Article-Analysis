CHENNAI: A week since the   municipality began setting up a micro compost centre (MCC) near the   burial ground near the  , it has earned the ire of residents, who alleged that the municipality is furthering encroachment on the lake bed. 

 "The Ganapathypuram burial ground, over 40 years ago, was an area measuring three grounds demarcated at one end of the lake bed. Some years ago, the municipality extended the area occupied around the lake for the burial ground. It is not being used by residents for burial due to other facilities present across the municipal area. Last week, workers hired by municipality started construction there," said  , an activist with Arappor Iyyakkam, who informed senior officials including the Kanchipuram collector of the ongoing work.
 
 He added that after he complained to Taluk office authorities and the construction was stopped for four days. "They resumed work on Friday," he said.
 
  "Instead of restoring the lake, authorities are themselves set upon destroying it," said another resident. The municipal solid waste transfer station of Pallavaram, located off the 200ft  , is also set up on the lake bed, and despite several petitions has not been shifted.
 
 Municipal commissioner of   said that the area in which the construction is going on is part of the burial ground and not an encroachment. "We are setting up a five-tonne MCC here. Several such MCCs will be set up, including at 17 parks in the municipality limits," he told TOI. He added that the municipality generates an average waste of 100 tonnes a day, of which 50 tonnes is organic waste. "We are aiming at reducing the wet waste at landfills," he added. 
 
 An officer from the Tambaram Revenue Divisional Office said that he has started inquiry over the use of the land.
