KOLKATA: In a first in the country, Kolkata police are going to install 1,000   barriers - like the ones used to stop cars at toll plazas or mall parking areas - at 250 crossings across the city to discipline jaywalkers and arrest the sudden rise in  .

 The first three sets of such barriers will be installed this week at three major crossings - Exide, Park Street-Chowringhee and the D L Khan Road-Lower Circular Road. The first phase will see 75 important crossings get such barriers, and the overall plan is to arm traffic cops with 1,000 such barriers at 250 crossings. 
 
 Each of these automated 'pedestrian boom barriers' costs around Rs 70,000 and the overall project cost will be Rs 7 crore. "All the barriers will be in sync with traffic signals at these key crossings," a senior policeman said, adding, "The standard rectangular beam will open - allowing pedestrians to pass when the pedestrian signal turns green - and will drop when the traffic signal is red." Officials said they would separate footpaths across the city from the carriageway with the help of iron rails before the installation of these barriers. "We have already started segregating footpaths from carriageways. About 1,000 civic volunteers will be deployed to ensure pedestrians do not spill on to the road through gaps," DCP (traffic)   said.
 
 In 2017, more than half of Kolkata's road accident victims - 172 out of 329 casualties - were pedestrians. The situation hasn't changed this year either, with 13 of the 30 who died till Monday being pedestrians. 
 
 Cops claim the high-end automated barriers will solve the jaywalking problem but motorists doubt it.
