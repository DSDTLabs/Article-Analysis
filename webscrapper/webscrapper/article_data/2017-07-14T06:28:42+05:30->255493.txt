New Delhi: Students of the Girls   in Panama Building at   held a   on Thursday against the decision to merge their school with the Hindi-medium   Number 1. During the protest, three girls fell sick due to the heat and one of them fainted. She was rushed to hospital where her condition was said to be stable.

 Over the last 10 years, parents said, the school had been making repeated requests to the government to make it an English-medium institution. Students complained that the mode of teaching maths at the school was Hindi, which held them back at the time of applying to DU. “We want the government to bring science subjects to the curriculum and make it English medium,” said a parent. They complained that instead of looking into their demands, the government has decided to merge the school with a Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, which is also Hindi medium, and has lower capacity. The parents said the strength in the GGSSS was around 800, while the SKV had around 300 students.
 
 Rajender Sharma, a member of the RWA where the school is situated, said several letters were written to authorities, asking them make the school English medium and include more students because the campus had the capacity to seat more. “Right now, we have two playgrounds. We have the capacity to bring more students, why not include primary sections too? This school has received so many awards for education. It has also brought a 100% result in Class X and XII boards this year,” he said.
 
 However, director of education,  , said: “Here, one school has about 200 students and the other around 500. The intention is to bring these small numbers together into one composite whole. In the process, the resources will not be compromised, nor will the strength of teachers be reduced,” she said.
 
 She added that the students would be allowed to study in the language medium of their choice, as they had been before. She said the merger of school was a stepping stone to making it English medium.
