Inspiration can come from anywhere, and   will happily vouch for the statement. After all, a nursery rhyme that his daughter   was singing inspired the actor to come up with a promotional song for '  2'.

 A few weeks after Akshay had completed shooting for the film, he happened to hear his young one sing For He’s A Jolly Good Fellow, and felt it would be apt for the courtroom comedy drama. A friend of the actor lets in, “One evening, Akshay was playing with his daughter when she started humming the song. He felt that they could come up with a quirky, cool song for Subhash Kapoor’s 'Jolly LLB 2' based on it. After a few quick calls with the makers, they locked in the idea and a few days later, the track was ready.”
 
 The song was shot in a single day last month in Mumbai with the film’s leading lady   and Akshay, along with a host of dancers.
