VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam   ( ) is planning to set up a plastic waste recycling plant in 2017. Once operational, this will be the first environment-friendly project of the civic body in the new year. 

 The corporation is to prepare the detail project report and invite tenders in January. The plant is likely to come up at Kapuluppada. 
 
 GVMC commissioner M Hari Narayanan said at present, they are working on laying roads using plastic as binding material. These roads are being laid in 10 localities in the city extending to 2 km in total at a cost of Rs 90 lakh. The corporation is procuring the plastic waste from select suppliers. The roads being developed include one at Papayyapalem for Rs 8 lakh and one in Vidya Nagar for Rs 6.5 lakh in the 70th ward, Hari Narayanan said.
 
 “At present, we are depending on private suppliers to procure the waste to lay the plastic roads. In the future, we will set up a   where we can get a waste which can be used for laying plastic roads,” GVMC commissioner Hari said.
 
 He said the city currently generates nearly 1,000 metric tonnes of solid waste daily, majority of which is plastic waste. When the plastic is recycled in the plant, nearly 20 per cent of it goes to waste again. “This plastic which cannot be recycled can be used for laying roads,” Hari Narayanan said.
 
 A senior engineer from GVMC said using plastic waste as road binding material is one way of dealing with the growing plastic menace in the city. “If the GVMC succeeds in setting up the plant, it will help neighbouring towns and cities also and prevent environment pollution,” said the engineer.
 
 An environment professor from   said when plastic is burnt, dioxins are released and these can cause respiratory disorders, cancer, and nervous and reproductive disorders. “GVMC should conduct campaigns urging people to deal with plastic waste more carefully. Otherwise, it will be more harmful and will get more losses than profits.”
