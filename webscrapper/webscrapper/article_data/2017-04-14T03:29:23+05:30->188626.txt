NEW DELHI: NCP chief   has asked   to join hands with regional parties to take on the   juggernaut, amplifying the calls for ‘grand alliance’ made this week by chief ministers Nitish Kumar and   and spotlighted through anti-BJP joint shows at the Election Commission and Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 “Looking at the current political scenario, it seems a challenging task for Congress to emerge as an alternative to BJP at the national level. Congress has no other option left but to join hands with small and regional parties to combat BJP’s surge,” Pawar said in his autobiography released this week.
 
 The Maratha strongman’s pitch for an anti-saffron coalition coincided with a slew of bypolls across states on Thursday which underlined the need for a coordinated opposition action. BJP made a strong statement by wresting an assembly seat in Delhi from ruling AAP besides retaining or gaining seats in other states. Congress managed to win both assembly contests in Karnataka that it rules and also retained Ater assembly seat in Madhya Pradesh. The results reinforced the perception of BJP’s ascendancy, highlighted by its massive victory in UP last month. In the wake of UP results, various political parties including senior Congress leaders publicly advocated that the opposition should come together in a “grand alliance’ to jointly confront BJP.
 
 Congress seems favourably inclined towards ‘mahagathbandhan’, with AICC managers acknowledging that BJP is gaining from a positive popular perception as also from division of votes in multi-cornered contests. While SP chief   and   said during UP polls that their alliance was for the long term, a strong backing for the idea from satraps Nitish Kumar and Mamata Banerjee has strengthened its possibility.
