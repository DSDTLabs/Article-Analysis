CHENNAI: The city   police on Thursday launched a cashless payment system (a portal) to help traffic violators pay fine without hassles. Those penalised don’t have to pay the fine to traffic police personnel. Going a step further, if they pay it in cash to personnel, it will be considered bribe, said the police wing. 

 After launching the online system, Chennai city police commissioner A K   said, “We have introduced this to help traffic violators pay their fine without any hassle. If people want to pay the fine in the traditional method, they can do so in mobile courts.” 
 
 Instructing police personnel to not take cash, he added that anyone giving cash to the police or the police receiving it would be considered “bribe” and legal action would be taken against both parties. 
 
 The cashless system has been introduced in the wake of issues between the police and traffic violators over payment. 
 
 Traffic violators can continue to pay fine by approaching personnel with card swiping (POS) machines. They can also pay at the government-run e-seva centres, via SBI online, Paytm, at post offices and mobile courts and save the receipt as a screenshot or a printout. Viswanathan thanked state crime record bureau additional commissioner A Arun and joint commissioner   for taking immense efforts to roll out the system.
