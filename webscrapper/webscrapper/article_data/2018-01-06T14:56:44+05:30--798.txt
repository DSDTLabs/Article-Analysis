NEW DELHI: Even as   today demanded the rejection of 
  Narayan Dass Gupta’s candidature for holding an office of profit,   termed the charge against its candidate as “frivolous” and said that trustees are exempted from disqualification.

 
 Gupta, who is currently a trustee of the National Pension System Trust (NPS Trust), was one of the three candidates to be nominated by AAP for its three Rajya Sabha seats, earlier this week. Businessman and social activist   and AAP functionary Sanjay Singh were the other two names shortlisted for Rajya Sabha elections scheduled on January 16.
 
 
  
 
 In a tweet, Congress leader Ajay Maken said that  , who was appointed as the trustee of government-owned Rs 1.75 lakh crore NPS Trust on March 30, 2015, is ineligible to contest for the Rajya Sabha seat.
 
  
  
 In this regard, the Congress had written a letter to the Returning officer of the Biennial Elections to the Council of State for NCT of Delhi, where it pointed that ND Gupta's nomination be rejected under Section 36 of the Representation of People Act, 1951, read-with Article 102 of the Constitution of India.
 
  
  
 
 Later in the day, AAP's National Spokesperson Raghav Chadha refuted the Congress's allegation as "frivolous" and said that trustees are exempted from disqualification under office of profit by Section 3, clause (L) of the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959.
 
  
  
 ND Gupta is considered a foremost expert on GST and has authored several books on accountancy and business. He is likely to be a shot in the arm for AAP which has been attacking BJP-led Centre over the implementation of GST.
