PANAJI: Luis Norton de Matos was not the highest profile coach who applied for the India under-17 coach vacancy nor was he the best qualified. From the 78 who applied for the post, there were more attractive names; a European coach was even shortlisted for the job but when the All India   Federation ( ) made the customary call, he didn't seem cut out for such an important task.

 De Matos, on the other hand, was raring to go. He told the AIFF president   that, if selected, he would take charge immediately, without even waiting for his luggage to arrive from Portugal. The man who comes with a recommendation from Euro 2016 winning coach Fernando Santos and Jose Mourinho had also done his homework well, and came prepared to conduct his first training session at the Trinity ground in Benaulim on Monday. 
 
 India's new under-17 coach had two sessions with the team on Monday, and at least during the first session which was open to the media, he had the team engrossed. Understandable, the boys after all were eager to impress and left nothing to chance during the 90-minute session. Whether it's a small sided game or elementary drills, the 22 outfield players did their best to catch his eye.
 
 De Matos didn't speak with the media, insisting he needs more time to assess the boys. But from what he told the players, it was clear he wanted change.
 
 “Move boys, move. You achieve nothing by standing still,” he told them, quickly translated in Hindi by team manager Velu Dhayalamani. The boys got the message and sprung into action. Ahead of the Under-17 World Cup in eight months, it's time to step on the gas and take their game to the next level. “He was here an hour before training was scheduled to commence at 8.15am,” said Abhishek Yadav, COO of the India U-17 World Cup squad.
