BENGALURU: A day before the deadline for submitting objections and suggestions on the Draft National   2018 expires,   leader and former environment minister   interacted with activists and members of civil society on Friday.

 While stressing that the policy is only a statement of intent, and not legislation,   urged citizens to come together and submit a memorandum on some of the more damaging features of the policy to the chairperson of the standing committee on environment and forests.
 
 As per the policy, degraded and underutilized parcels of land available with forest corporations will be managed to produce quality timber with scientific interventions. Additionally, public-private participation models will be developed to undertake afforestation and reforestation activities in degraded forest areas. This has angered activists, who are worried about the possible privatisation of forest land.
 
 Members of the audience even said the policy seemed to be giving private players access to degraded forest land to pursue their economic interests, and that the definition of degraded land could be changed, possibly giving private players access to good forest land too.
 
 “As I see it, there are two driving forces behind the departures. One is the understanding that forests are carbon sinks and must absorb greenhouse gas emissions. The other has to do with the 40% of forest cover classified as degraded. What this policy does is open the doors for participation of non-governmental actors, mainly private sector. This could lead to privatisation of forest land in the name of improving quality,” he added.
