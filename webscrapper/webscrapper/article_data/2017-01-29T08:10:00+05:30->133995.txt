NOIDA: Captain  , who some time ago was one of the five   the ticket hopefuls, said on Saturday as an independent candidate from Noida that 10 BJP functionaries including BJP candidate Pankaj Singh had “pressured him” to withdraw his candidature fearing that Gupta would cut his vote bank.

 Gupta was among the five candidates who had initially bought a nomination form on behalf of the saffron party. Gupta said the fact that he was popular among ex-servicemen and claimed the support of the Vaishya community and the perception that Noida was a ‘safe seat’ for him must have weighed on the BJP brass.
 
 Gupta, whose NGO, Maulik Bharat Trust, has claimed credit for leading campaigns to make the DND toll-free and unearth other scams, claimed that Pankaj Singh even met him and sought his support.
 
 Repeatedly referring to Pankaj as a “parachuted candidate”, he said that Union home minister Rajnath Singh has also engaged intelligence agencies to keep tabs on him apart from having his supporters’ phones tapped.
 
 He also alleged that Noida candidates from BSP and SP have cases of sexual assault against them, which they have not disclosed in their election affidavit. While   is fighting for the BSP, SP has fielded   for the seat. He said he would expose them in his next news conference. In the same breath, Gupta said he would hold another news conference to expose two unspecified “scams”. Saying that he has been associated with BJP for the past 10 years, Gupta urged ex-servicemen, traders and others present at the gathering to vote for the ‘torch’, his election symbol.
