MUMBAI: The strike by Ola and   drivers continued for second day on Tuesday causing inconvenience to scores of office-goers and those arriving at domestic and  . 

 For railway commuters stranded due to a   by apprentice students at  , it is frustrating not to get alternate mode of transport as aggregator cabs are unavailable and   and autos are either refusing or are overcharging.
 
 Office-goers who would usually book Ola or Uber cabs to reach office in case of any rail disruption are finding “no cabs available” on app. The BEST has decided to ply more buses from outside Matunga and other stations on Central Railway suburban line to cater to those stranded due to rail roko.
 
 The aggregator cabs may return on roads in afternoon as there are chances of strike being called off after talks with aggregator firms in the afternoon, sources said.
 
 The MNS transport union, a wing of Raj Thackeray-led MNS party, is spearheading the strike and has announced that all cabs of Ola and Uber will be off roads till their demands are met.
 
 The union is demanding better earnings for drivers, more incentives for rides and also withdrawal of cases in which they feel few driver partners have been ‘wrongly blacklisted.’
