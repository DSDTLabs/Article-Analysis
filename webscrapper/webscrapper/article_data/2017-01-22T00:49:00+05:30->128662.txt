Jodhpur: Considering the rise in court cases relating to water disputes in the state, especially in irrigation pockets, an initiative has been taken to resolve them through community mediation centres. Under the initiative, designated and trained villagers will mediate for the solution of water disputes.

 First such centre in the state was inaugurated by irrigation minister Ram Pratap in Arriyanwali village of Hanumangarh with 13 trained members.
 
 Conceptualised and rolled out by LIBRA India and LIFE, two voluntary organisations based out of Jodhpur and Delhi respectively, this community centre is a pilot resolve to resolve the water related disputed in villages and if it becomes a success, the process will be replicated in entire state.
 
 Managing trustee of LIBRA India Sanjeet Purohit said, “All assistance will be provided to make this model a success and based on it, we would submit a proposal to the state government with a view to replicate this model in entire state.”
 
 “We are also moving forward for policy advocacy to get pre-litigation mediation as conditional before litigation for inter-state farmers’ disputes regarding water distribution in canal area,” Purohit said.
 
 The concept of having a community mediation centre for resolving water related disputes at primarily level in canal area of Rajasthan was discussed at various levels like government department, villagers and water user associations along with the high court, which was welcomed unanimously.
 
 Purohit said that the concept and practice of resolving community level disputes through community mediation centre is quite prevalent and successful in Nepal, where 138 such centers are functional. A team of LIBRA India will be leaving for Nepal to study the concept and success of this model in Nepal, which is also a water rich country with ample water related disputes.
