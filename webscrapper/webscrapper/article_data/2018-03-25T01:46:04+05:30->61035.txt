 According to the committee officials, the eight-year-old boy was kept at the police station for three days before they were informed about him.
 
 The boy had told the police he lived with his parents in Mandawali in Delhi and his father Ansar drove a cab for a living. The cops had reportedly brought the boy to the police station on Tuesday after he was found travelling alone in an auto-rickshaw. He was handed over to the Childline only on Thursday evening.
