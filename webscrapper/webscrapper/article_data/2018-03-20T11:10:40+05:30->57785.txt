BHUBANESWAR: Students of Rama Devi (RD) Women's University - the first such in the state - on Monday called off their stir demanding immediate selection of land for a second campus and withdrawal of the decision to abolish teaching posts of the erstwhile  .

 Soubhagya Soumyashree  , the president of the university students' union, said, "At a discussion with senior officers of the higher education department, we were told that the government would look into the matter of a second campus. If it does not fulfil our demands, we will stage a protest again."
 
 Earlier in the day, the students locked the university gate and shouted slogans against the higher education department for upgrading RD Women's College. Later, they blocked the   road and held up placards.
 
 "The university currently has 46 affiliated colleges. What made the government abolish a well-known autonomous college?" asked Samal. She added that the government could have brought the college within the jurisdiction of the university without abolishing it.
 
 On the matter of the second campus, the students said the state government could not find a suitable piece of land despite search for it for two years. "Due to the problem of space crunch, we cannot hold a sports meet, or have modern laboratories and research centres," said a student.
 
 An officer of the additional secretary rank in the higher education department said the state government would finalize land for the second campus soon.
 
 On Friday, teachers of the university staged a dharna in front of the registrar's office in protest against the abolition of 71 teaching posts at the RD Women's Autonomous College.
 
 Students had supported the demand and torched tyres in front of the university gate.
