CHENNAI: IIT, Madras on Wednesday unveiled its centre for innovation and entrepreneurship which will pave the way for more teaching, research, product development and policy-making initiatives.

 Named the `Gopalakrishnan-Deshpande Centre' (GDC) after three of its wellknown alumni, it has an initial funding of $1 million from Infosys vice-chairman   and venture capitalists   and  .
 
 From seeding new courses in the realm of innovation and entrepreneurship to enabling interdisciplinary collaborations, the centre is projected to become a go-to place for students with ideas and projects.
 
 While the institute already has a functioning Centre for Innovation which looks into student research and innovation and an incubation cell that facilitates startups, the GDC was started to give way for a broader ground of innovation allied activities and finding solutions for current issues.
 
 The traditional approach involves a faculty member finalising a research proposal and running around for government funding, leading to a protracted process, said IIT-M director  . “This centre would instead focus on building an adaptable or marketable idea, more than just facilitating financial support. By doing this, the centre will look to impact all domains fundamental to the research, training, product engineering and policy-making,“ he said.
 
 Healthcare, renewable energy , environment and education are the big areas currently to define solutions, said Desh Deshpande.
