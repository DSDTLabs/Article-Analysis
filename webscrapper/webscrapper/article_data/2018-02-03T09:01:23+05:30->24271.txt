JAIPUR: The   proposals provided a fillip to the vibrant solar sector in  . As per the proposals, the import of solar tempered glass for manufacture of solar cells will be exempted from customs duty. The decision will reduce the cost of manufacturing and eventually the cost of solar modules and power systems. Earlier, the duty was 5%.

 In his speech, finance minister   said, “Many farmers are installing solar water pumps to irrigate their fields. Solar electricity is generated by farmers using their lands. The government will take necessary measures and encourage state governments to put in place a mechanism to purchase surplus solar power produced by farmers by distribution companies or licensees at reasonably remunerative rates,”
 
 Sunil Bansal, general secretary,   (RSA), said that power for agricultural sector was adding stress to the Discoms as they were subsidized. If   can be encouraged, then the burden on the Discoms would reduce.
 
 “The idea is good but it needs infrastructure to connect the solar systems in the fields to the distribution network,” added Bansal. Rajasthan is one of the leading states where solar pumps are increasingly used and the government also provides subsidies for such systems.
