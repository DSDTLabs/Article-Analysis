MANGALURU: The first premonsoon showers lashed   through Tuesday and left large swathes of the city marooned.

 
 Nine hours of rain from 9am killed two persons and brought the city to its knees.
 
 Mohini, 61, died when a wall collapsed on her at Udayanagar near KPT. Muthabai, 80, a resident of Kambala, drowned while trying to get out of her flooded house.
 
 The Panambur Weather Observatory recorded 270mm rainfall at Surathkal, and Mangaluru too received approximately the same amount, perhaps the highest rainfall recorded in the past few decades on a single day.
 
 “I’ve never seen such flooding here in the past 25 years. I had to shut my shop as the adjacent storm water drain was overflowing,” said Shivaram, a shop vendor.
 
 There were power outages in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts after landslides brought down over 1,000 electric poles.
 
 Heavy rain also lashed Udupi district, claiming two lives. Nidhi, a Class 4 student of Ganapati High School, was feared dead after she slipped into a canal. Cops are yet to recover her body.
 
 Sheela, 35, a GP member, died after lightning struck her outside her house in Basathi Shale, Bailuru, Udupi district, around 3.30am.
 
 Meanwhile, two fishermen were feared drowned and four others rescued after their fishing boat sank about 12 nautical miles off the Honnavar coast in the Arabian Sea early Tuesday morning.
 
 Mangaluru braces for more rain today
 Mangaluru city and adjoining areas in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada districts will continue to receive heavy rain on Wednesday and Thursday. In some places, the rainfall will be severe, according to the weatherman. Tuesday’s torrential rain along the coast is not the southwest monsoon, which is still a day or two away from entering the state.
