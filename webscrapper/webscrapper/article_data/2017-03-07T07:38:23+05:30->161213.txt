CHENNAI: Enumeration of street vendors in the city will be taken up by the corporation from March 8, the civic body announced on Monday. 

 In a statement, the corporation said the work will be taken up in all 15 zones simultaneously. Using a software, the corporation will use its field staff as well as contracted agencies to undertake the massive operations. Corporation sources said commissioner D Karthikeyan instructed officials to complete the work in a month.
 
 Since notifying the   (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Rules 2015 on November 2, 2015, the corporation had put off the enumeration process for various reasons. This also delayed the formation of a   to settle disputes regarding street vending.
 
 After enumeration, the corporation will issue bio-metric identity cards to the vendors, which will legalise their trade. They will be allotted space, likely on a footpath, and will be allowed to conduct business without interference from the police or corporation. Already, there are around 7,000 vendors who have been issued with certificates of vending as prescribed by the Justice M Ramamurthy hawking zone implementation committee.
 
 "The corporation should ensure that only actual street vendors are issued the identity cards. There is scope for political manipulation in this process," said B  , general secretary, Chennai small vendors' federation.
 
 The city is estimated to have over one lakh street vendors.
