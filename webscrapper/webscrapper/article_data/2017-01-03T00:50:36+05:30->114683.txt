CHENNAI: A 13-year-old boy died when he touched a live wire passing through a commercial building in   on Sunday night.

 The city police said  , a resident of   and a Class 8 student at a private school, had stepped out at 9 pm to make photocopies for a school assignment.
 
 Arokiasudhan climbed a flight of stairs to get to the shop on the first floor of a commercial building, an investigating officer said. He was carrying few sheets of papers he was supposed to hand in at school on Monday morning as part of an assignment.
 
 “As he approached the shop, the boy failed to notice live overhead cables close to the building,” the officer said. “He lifted his hand, touched the wires and sustained an electric shock.”
 
 The shock was powerful enough to lift and slam Arokiasudhan against a wall in the building. He cried out in pain and bystanders hurried to his rescue. They tried to give him first aid, but failed to resuscitate him. A couple of onlookers alerted policemen, who took him to   where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.
 
 “The building is not properly lit and the boy was in a hurry because he thought the shop would close,” the officer said. “He probably failed to see the wire.”
 
 On a complaint by Arokiasudhan’s parents, the Thoraipakkam police registered a case under CrPC Section 174 (police to probe a suicide or an accidental death, etc) and sent the body for postmortem.
 
 “We are looking into whether there was any negligence by electricity board officials or the shopkeeper,” the officer said.
