Actor   was caught in a fix recently. As he was interacting with a group of kids, he found that all of them were either a Vijay fan, Mohanlal fan or   fan. "I was heartbroken," he writes. "Aren't any of you my fan? I asked, to which one of them replied, "My dad is a great fan of yours. So what's your dad's name, I asked, and he said, ' Sasi'." Jayasurya goes on to say that it was a moment when he fell in love with the usually hated name Sasi, for the first time in his life.

 Incidentally, a film starring   in the lead is coming up, titled Ayal Sasi.
