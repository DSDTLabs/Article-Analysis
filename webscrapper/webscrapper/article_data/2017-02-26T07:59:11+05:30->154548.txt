CHENNAI: A carnival-like atmosphere welcomed shoppers at   in T Nagar on Saturday when the second trial run for the   was held. The city's first   got the green signal from the public even as it left traders frowning. 

 In January, TOI had reported that after the first trial in November 2016 for half-a-day, the second test would be from 8am to 5pm. As part of the trial, a 700-m stretch between Thanikachalam Road Junction and Panagal Park was made exclusive for pedestrians. Activities to keep children busy and entertain pedestrians were organised. Cars, autorickshaws, hawkers and on-street parking were restricted and only buses and motorbikes allowed to ply on earmarked portions. Tamil Nadu   officials were present to assess the impact of a pedestrian zone on the air quality. 
 
 A section of shoppers wanted the pedestrian plaza to be made permanent. "This is the best thing to happen to this place. Today it felt very welcoming," said Malathi Ramakrishnan of West Mambalam. Shoppers visiting Panagal Park parked cars and two-wheelers in four specified areas and walked the rest of the distance.
 
 "We had to walk but we didn't have to jostle with vehicles," said Sandhya, a resident of  .
 
 During the last trial, traders had downed shutters in protest. On Saturday, most of them said business was seriously hit. "We need on-street car parking or at least a drop-and-go point," said Shahul Hamid, manager at a garment shop. "We had zero business today. Our customers come in cars, those who walked in today were window shoppers. We will take this up with the traders association of Panagal Park."
 
 But experts differ. "Across the world, when shopping hubs were pedestrianised traders rejected the idea. But today these spaces are buzzing with activity," said Aswathy Dilip of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy . "Presentations have been made before traders to show that their business will increase with more people using a pedestrian zone."
