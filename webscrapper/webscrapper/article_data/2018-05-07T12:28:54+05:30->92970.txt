NEW DELHI: The   has officially informed   that India will not play any Day/Night Test match on their tour Down Under at the end of this year.

 
 
 
 While Cricket Australia were insistent on having a pink ball Test, which has been a convention for all touring teams for the past two years, but the Indian board has made it clear that they will not deviate from the traditional red-ball matches.
 
 
 
 With Indian team management, headed by chief coach  , intimating the   (CoA) that the team will take at least 18 months to prepare for the Day/Night Test, acting secretary Choudhary was told to pass on the message to CA chief executive  .
 
 CA wanted the opening Test at Adelaide from December 6-10 to be a pink ball Test match.
 
 "I am directed to say by the Committee of Administrators that India would begin to play in the format only in about a year's time. Under the circumstances, I regret to say that the proposed D/N Test cannot be played and all Tests will have to have the conventional structure," Choudhary wrote in his e-mail to Sutherland.
 
 Last week, Sutherland had told a radio station in Australia that India's reluctance to play the pink ball Test was primarily because of their urge to win the series. Australia has not lost a single Test match under lights played at home.
 
 On the other hand, among Indian players, only Cheteshwar Pujara and Murali Vijay have played Day/Night pink ball matches during Duleep Trophy.
