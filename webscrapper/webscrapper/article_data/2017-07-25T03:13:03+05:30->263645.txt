NEW DELHI: The   on Monday rejected a PIL seeking fresh probe into the killing of nearly 200   in J&K in 1989-90 which forced nearly five lakh members of the community to flee the militancy infested state.

 The  , which three months ago sought answers from the Centre on the special investigation team’s decision to close 199 of the 293 cases relating to anti-Sikh riots 33 years ago, dismissed the PIL by an outfit called ‘Roots in Kashmir’ and said no fruitful purpose would be served by reopening the cases after 27 years.
 
 A bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice D Y Chandrachud said, “...why did you not move the court or the authorities for 27 years and kept shouting only from rooftops? How can investigation happen after 27 years?” The petitioner’s counsel Vikas Podara said over 700 Pandits were murdered, of which 200 FIRs were still pending investigation. “Two persons — Yasin Malik and Bitta Karate — have openly boasted about killing Pandits.
 
 But neither the state nor the Centre took any action against them... The Supreme Court is the only hope for the community,” he said.
 
 However, the bench dismissed the PIL and said, “We decline to entertain this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, for the simple reason that the instances referred to in the present petition pertain to the year 1989-90, and more than 27 years have passed by since then. No fruitful purpose would emerge, as evidence is unlikely to be available’s at this late juncture.”
