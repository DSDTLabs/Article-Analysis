Though we will still have to pay the price of global warming, 2018=2 (Moon) is the redeeming year. So, we may expect some respite from the rising temperature as Moon is lunar, not solar. 
 
  The question on most minds is what does 2018 look like. As per Numerology, do the numbers add up well? Will the promised ‘achhe din’ really translate into anything at all? Will the Modi government get another five years? 
 
  
 
 2018=11, the meaning of Number 11 in Numerology is that this is an ominous number to occultists. It gives warning of hidden dangers, trial, and treachery from others. It has a symbol of a “clenched hand”, “a lion muzzled” and of a person who will have great difficulties to contend against. The flip side of the Moon is that it makes a person moody and sometimes even prone to depression. Many terror attacks have happened world over in the month of July (Cancer ruler-Moon). The Twin-Towers attack took place on September 11, a Number 2 date.
 
  
 
 The tough times for India, post demonetisation, may continue till August 2018 as we are in our 71st year of Independence. 71=8, Saturn (Shani) the strict lord of trials. In fact, it was November 8, a Number 8 date when our PM made the announcement of demonetisation at 8pm. But after taking trials, Saturn can compensate well too. Our 72nd year (7+2=9) shall be far better, can even be a landmark year as 3, 6, 9 are a family and India adds to 3 and Bharat adds to 6. 2019=3, again when our country could get close to being a super power. 
 
  
 
 People born on the 2nd, 11th, 20th and 29th in any month are termed as Number 2 people, ruled by the Moon, which is closely linked with Number 7 of Neptune. The Cancerians are also governed by Moon or Number 2.
 
  
 
 The moon attributes to dreamy, romantic, gentle and creative. Hence, most Number 2 people are talented.   (29/12) was a Number 2, Amitabh Bachchan (11/10) is also a Number 2. Shah Rukh Khan is also Number 2 (2/11).
 
  Cancer ruler being Number 2, Moon, Katrina Kaif (16/07) and Priyanka Chopra (18/07) Ranveer Singh (6/07) have also done pretty well. Other industries to do well could be service providing industry like teaching and consultancy. Music, media, art and fitness parlors, sea travel, shipping, imports/exports, fashion and interior designing are also likely to do well. Others to shine could be from occult sciences. 
 
  Also, gold could lose its sheen a bit while Bitcoin could gain further ground. Since Moon makes us inventive and lazy at the same time, we must not depend on others around to push us. Yoga and meditation is strongly recommended to tackle mood swings caused by the Moon. The lucky gem of the Moon is the Pearl that assists in calming mental faculties and can help control mood swings. 1,2,4 and 7 are a family of Numbers so in 2018 (2) those born with such numbers can expect to get their dues. 
 
  Persons born on 1, 2, 4 and 7 series are amongst those born on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 16th, 19th, 20th, 22nd, 25th, 28th, 29th and 31st. Taurus and Cancer born are ruled by 2, Moon too, while Leo ruler is 1, Sun, so those born under such Zodiac signs may call the shots too.
 
  Others to do well are those whose current age is same as their birth number. Like if you are born on the 1st, 10th, 19th or 28th in any month then all years adding to 1 could be eventful, like your 19th, 28th, 37th, 46th, 55th, 64th, 73rd years.
 
  
 
 Green, cream, white and gray would be the best shades in the year of Moon while blue is the eternal colour every year as it’s like a universal donor.
