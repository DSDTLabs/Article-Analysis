Surat: A 60-year-old tantrik was booked at Kapodra police station on Thursday for allegedly raping a 16-year-old girl in August 2017. 

 The rape survivor, who is fatherless, did not get support from her maternal uncle as he is a staunch follower of the accused. The girl was supported by the fiancée of her cousin brother in approaching the police who detained the accused for questioning and are likely to arrest him any time soon. 
 
 Mahendragiri Goswami, a resident of Kapodra, who was booked for raping the girl at his house, had threatened her of dire consequences if she complained to anyone about it. The girl whose father died a few years ago and lives with her uncle in the city shared her trauma with his family only recently. 
 
 Her uncle is a follower of the tantrik and had sent his niece to the latter’s house to help him in cleaning it. The accused raped the minor thrice since his family had gone out. 
 
 “The rape survivor tried to tell her uncle’s family members about the offence but they paid no heed to her since they were staunch followers of the accused. She kept quiet and recently informed her cousin brother’s fiancée who helped her in filing a police complaint after discussing the issue with the family members,” police said.
 
 The girl was taken for medical examination to a hospital. Police are waiting for the medical report to proceed further in the matter.
