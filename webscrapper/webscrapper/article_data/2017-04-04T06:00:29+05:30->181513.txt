AHMEDABAD: Irked by the   order to not exempt hotels and restaurants from the ban on liquor vends within 500 metres of national and state highways from April 1, members of the   (HRA) of Gujarat, wrote to deputy CM Nitin Patel. Soon after the order, permit liquor shops at three hotels on SG Road, namely, The Grand Bhagwati (TGB),   and Novotel, have closed. The hospitality industry thus is suffering losses of lakhs on a daily basis.

 “The challenge is to cater to our guests and clients who stay at the hotel and want to buy liquor. While we welcome the Supreme Court decision as a progressive move, it will certainly impact the industry to a great extent. Currently, there is no clarity on the implementation of the law. We’re in contact with legal experts and will see how to best work it out for us,” said Tejus Jose, general manager, Novotel Ahmedabad and member of   and Restaurant Associations (FHRA).
 
 HRA members submitted a letter to Nitin Patel urging him to lift the ban for hotels in Gujarat. Narendra Somani, president of HRA Gujarat, said, “As Gujarat is a dry state, the implementation of the act is irrelevant. This is because permit holders who procure liquor are not allowed to drink in public spaces and may do so only indoors.”
 
 “Moreover, now we are in the municipal corporation limits and the highway doesn’t exist anymore. If need be, we will also approach the Supreme Court to exempt Gujarat from the ban as a prohibition policy already exists here,” he added.
