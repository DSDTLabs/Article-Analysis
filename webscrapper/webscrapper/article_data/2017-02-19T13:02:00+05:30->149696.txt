THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Located close to the world famous Attukal Devi temple, the authorities of Women’s Prison at   in the city are planning to cash in on the business prospect of the ensuing   by conducting a   of their products during the annual festival of the temple. The trade fair will have on sale products ranging from saris to food products made by the prison inmates. 

 According to prison superintendent O V Valli, the idea was stemmed from the way devotees used the prison campus for resting and even offering pongala in the previous years, owing to its proximity to the temple. 
 
 The main aim of the fair is to market the products of the sari designing unit, which was launched a year ago. Here, trained inmates try attractive designs on saris using the method of screen printing. 
 
 “We are planning to bring out special kasavu saris with embroidery designs done by our inmates for the trade fair,” the superintendent said. Besides saris, nighties and churidhars tailored by the prison inmates will also be available in the trade fair. Handmade umbrellas and miniature caparisons (nettipattam) are the other highlights among the products. Apart from this, there will also be a host of handicraft items made by the inmates, Valli said. 
 
 Another important section of the fair would be the prison’s bakery unit, where more than 25 varieties of bakery items will be on sale. 
 
 During the last Christmas, the prison authorities here had organized a similar 10-day trade fair but only for bakery items, especially Christmas cakes, produced by the inmates. The success of that fair has prompted the authorities here to organize another one in a big scale. 
 
 Besides the trade fair, the prison will also continue to serve free lunch for devotees on the pongala day. Serving lunch for devotees has been a regular practice ever since the sub-jail here was converted into women’s prison in 2011.
