CHENNAI: Raids by the income tax department on the Buhari and   groups of BS   continued for the third consecutive day on Friday , showing sleuths that the entrepreneur had evaded Rs 420 crore in taxes.

 I-T investigators however made no cash seizures on either of the premises they searched.
 
 “We have evidence of the groups evading taxes of Rs 420 crore,“ an investigating officer said. “This is a preliminary estimate. The total is likely to rise once we collate all evidence and corroborate it with documents we seize and those presented by assesses during hearings.“
 
 As I-T officers continued searches on the groups' properties, investigators summoned two of their UAE-based directors directly to Chennai.
 
 “We summoned two directors from Dubai as we needed some clarifications on a few things,“ the officer said.“They arrived on Friday morning and we questioned them.“
 
 The searches are in not connected to demonetisation.“The current searches are only based on information of tax evasion. There is no demonetisation angle to this,“ the officer said. “There is also no connection between the groups and sand mining baron   as their businesses are different.“
 
 The I-T investigators are likely to complete their searches by Saturday , after which they will begin interrogation of witnesses and suspects and assessment of documents.
