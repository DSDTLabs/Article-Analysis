Amidst uncertainty over his continuity at the helm of affairs in the state, BJP state president   was sworn-in as the 23rd chief minister of Karnataka.

 In a rather “subdued” atmosphere, unlike in 2013 when former chief minister   took oath at the   in Bengaluru, Yeddyurappa took oath at the glass house inside the Raj Bhavan.
 
 The oath was administered by Governor   in the presence of hundreds of BJP party workers and the central leadership including Prakash Javdekar, JP Nadda and Dharmendra Pradhan.
 
 Yeddyurappa took the oath in the name of God and Farmers.
 
 Contrary to reports that four other BJP MLAs including  ,  , Govind Karjol and K S Eshwarappa were to be sworn-in, Yeddyurappa was the lone person to take oath as the CM.
 
 Such is the confidence levels in the party that Ashoka and other leaders said they will all take oath after the BJP proves its majority in the next 15 days.
 
 Earlier in the day Yeddyurappa went to the Radhakrishna temple in Sanjaynagar and offered his prayers before coming to Raj Bhavan to take oath.
 
 After oath, Yeddyurappa is scheduled to hold a meeting of the senior Karnataka bureaucrats and hold a single member cabinet meeting.
 
 At the other end, by 10 am the opposition parties including the Congress and JDS MLAs stages a protest against Yeddyurappa being invited by the Governor to form the government despite not having adequate numbers via-a-via the coalition of the other two parties.
 
 KPCC working president Dinesh Gundu Rao claimed it was an opportunity given by the governor for BJP to indulge in horse trading. 
 
 He said the Congress has 79 signatories in their alliance including two independents and the 37 JDS MLAs and one BSP MLA.
