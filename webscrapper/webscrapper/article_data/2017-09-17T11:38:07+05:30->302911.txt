The India division of US-based   association, Project Management Institute, is in discussions with the  , ministry of urban development, ministry of statistics and programme implementation, ministry of petroleum and ministry of transport to have their employees certified in project management.

 Looking for active involvement from the government, the body is also in talks with states such as Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat to train their staff in project management. “PMI is also working with corporates including Infosys, L&T and TCS to enable their staff, right from the junior level, to be certified in project management. Those certified would not only manage their projects better, but also draw a 35% premium in salaries, compared to their non-certified counterparts,” said  , chair, PMI board of directors. A survey conducted by the institute said that the country requires seven lakh project managers every year for the next 10 years which is 25% of the total global requirement.
 
  “There is a huge talent gap in project management. We currently have 42,000 certified personnel and the main issue is that senior-level executives in companies don’t realise the need for project management certification,” said Raj Kalady, country director, PMI India. Dickson pointed out that China, which came under the ambit of the PMI at around the same time as India, currently has over 1,80,000 trained personnel.
