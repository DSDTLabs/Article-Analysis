SHILLONG: Trust the   to go ahead a spoil a perfect finale in the way only they can.

 Aizawl FC, who were on threshold of a famous victory in the I-League, had threatened to pull out of their final fixture here in protest after they learnt that all four officials for the game were from Bengal.
 
 Mere hours before their kick-off against  , the Aizawl management learnt that referee Pranjal Bannerjee, assistant referees  ,   and fourth official   were to officiate what was virtually being seen as the 'final' of the league, with Aizawl needing just a point to be crowned champions. The club's general secretary   dashed off a letter to AIFF general secretary   officially complaining the appointment.
 
 The appointment of the match officials from West Bengal, the state association to which   belongs, was bound to leave a sour taste.
 
 Vanlalnghaka told TOI here: "Aizawl had decided to withdraw from the fixture but after getting assurance from the AIFF, the (Aizawl) board has decided that we play."
 
 What beggars belief is that the AIFF sent an anti-corruption officer before this game, but completely bungled up when it came to appointing the referee for this all-important game.
