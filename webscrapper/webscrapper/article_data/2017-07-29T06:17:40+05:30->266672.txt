BENGALURU: Hakib and Rizwan, both aged 22, were assaulted by a group of men on the state highway near   village on the outskirts of Bengaluru for allegedly harassing a girl on Friday. 

    inspector told TOI: "We arrested them based on the girl's complaint under   section 509 (act intended to insult modesty of a woman). Two others, Anil Kumar, 28, and Manjunath, 26, have been arrested under section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) for assaulting the duo." 
 
 The girl was returning from college when four men on two bikes began harassing her. She started screaming as she ran to her home, 20 metres away. The mob, alerted by the girl's scream, caught Hakib and Rizwan, while the other two fled.
 
 A video of the incident, which has gone viral on social media, shows a group thrashing the duo and even trying to strip them. After beating them up for over 10 minutes, the group took the two to the police station. "They were arrested after the girl lodged a complaint," police said.
