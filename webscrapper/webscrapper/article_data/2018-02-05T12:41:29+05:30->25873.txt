PATNA: Central intelligence agencies have sounded alert in the state after a handwritten poster appealing people to join terror organization   in Iraq and Syria ( ) was found pasted on a wall at Bramharshi Chowk under the Town police station area in   district on Sunday morning.

 The poster written with green sketch pen was spotted by passersby and the police was informed. 
 
 This is the second such incident in Bihar within a year. Earlier on March 18, 2017, a similar poster appealing youths to join ISIS was found on an electric pole at village Sikrauli Bigha under the Nauhatta police station area in Rohtas district. However, the poster with picture of ISIS flag and photos of terrorists was a computer printout. In Sunday poster, ‘Join ISIS’ was written in English and Arabic. In the last year’s poster, appeal to youths was written in poor English.
 
 The alleged ISIS poster found within 20 days of the failed terror attack by Jamaat-uL-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) in   on January 19 has alerted the intelligence agencies. 
 
 Aurangabad SP Satya Prakash said Intelligence Bureau (IB) and special branch of state police were informed about the poster. “It might be the handiwork of some miscreants,” he said.
 
 “ISIS has been trying to spread its roots in the country for the last few years and no wonder it might be a part of their online propaganda to lure youths,” sources said, adding such posters have surfaced in the past in some other parts of the country as well.
