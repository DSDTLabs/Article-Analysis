BATHINDA: Even as the issue of the collection of ‘goonda tax’ from transporters to take building material inside the Guru   refinery at   in   has been sorted out, the refinery authorities have started getting the supplies of sand and gravel through a rail link. A train loaded with the construction material reached the refinery on Tuesday.

 Sources said it is for the first time in nearly a decade that the construction material had been transported through rail. The refinery is a joint venture between   (HPCL) and Laxmi Narayan Mittal’s Mittal Energy Limited. Work on the refinery had started in 2008 and it became operational in 2012.
 
 The refinery authorities declined to divulge details about the supplies being received through train. According to sources, when the issue of ‘goonda tax’ was at its peak in February, the refinery management had ordered sand and gravel while exploring option of getting supplies through rail route.
 
 After chief minister   ordered police not to spare anyone indulging in collection of ‘goonda tax,’ the transporters heaved a sigh of relief. Sources said the refinery authorities made it clear to the transporters that despite a train arriving with construction material, supplies through road route would continue unabated and train would be used only if the need arose.
 
 “A train loaded with construction material arrived on Tuesday. It is not that refinery will avail rail route only. The ongoing supplies through land route will not be affected in any way and transporters need not worry about it,” a refinery official said.
