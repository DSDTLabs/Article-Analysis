NEW DELHI: The former concessionaire for  ,   ( ), on Wednesday filed a   in   for early payment of the arbitration award it has won against  . 

 The petition has been filed in HC under Section 9 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for an early payment of the arbitration award. DAMEPL, a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure, said in a statement, “Rinfra promoted DAMEPL was awarded compensation of Rs 4,670 crore by a three-member arbitral tribunal in a unanimous decision last week against DMRC.”
 
 “Under guidelines issued by Niti Aayog vide their memorandum dated September 5, 2016, PSUs are to pay 75% of the award amount even if they propose to challenge the arbitral award. RInfra is thus expected to receive Rs 3,500 crore as per the above guidelines,” the DAMEPL statement added.
 
 Company officials said the “entire proceeds” will be used to repay its lenders, comprising public and other banks.
 
 Incidentally, DMRC had last week announced that it would be challenging the arbitration tribunal order in HC. Delhi Metro spokesman Anuj Dayal had said, “DMRC has decided to file an objection petition before HC under Section 34 of the arbitration act.”
 
 “DMRC is of the opinion that the termination notice issued by DAMEPL was legally untenable and was against the provisions of the concessionaire agreement,” Dayal said. Delhi Metro has been consistently toeing this line since DAMEPL walked out of the project citing civil defects.
 
 In July 2012, DAMEPL had to shut operations due to problems in the underground section of the Airport Express line. The line could be re-opened after repairs only after six months in January 2013.
