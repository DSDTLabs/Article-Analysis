PANAJI: The   national president,   on Sunday will felicitate chief minister Manohar Parrikar for forming the BJP-led coalition government in the state.

 Parrikar is serving his fourth term as a chief minister of Goa. Parrikar, who was the defence minister with the Central government, returned to state politics immediately after the March 11 assembly results, following demands by coalition partners in Goa that they will support BJP only if Parrikar is sent back to the state as chief minister.
 
 Speaking to STOI, BJP general secretary Sadanand Shet Tanavade said that the Union minister for road, transport, highways and shipping   will felicitate Shah for winning maximum number of state elections. He also said that railway minister Suresh Prabhu is likely to attend the felicitation function.
 
 Shah will arrive in Goa on Sunday and address a rally, which is expected to draw in over 25,000 people. Tanavade said that around 2,000 people are expected from most of the major constituencies, and around 1,000 people from some of the weaker BJP constituencies will attend the meeting.
 
 He also said that coalition partners have also been invited to attend the meeting. Newly inducted former Valpoi Congress MLA, Vishwajit Rane is likely to share the dais for the first time with BJPâ€™s national president.
 
 After the public meeting, BJP had hosted a dinner for Shah so that he can interact with the BJP MLAs. Tanavade said that immediately after the dinner, Shah will leave to Delhi.
 
 A senior BJP officer said that Parrikar will expand the state cabinet and fill the remaining two vacancies. 
 
 He also said that Vishwajit Rane and Dabolim MLA Mauvin Godinho are likely to be sworn in as ministers next week.
