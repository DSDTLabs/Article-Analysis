Vijayawada: Carcasses of three   turtles were found on   beach in Guntur district on Monday. What appeared to be a stray incident is a normal sight for local fisherfolk.

 “The turtles either get trapped in the fishing nets and die,” Maddala Sivaiah, a local fisherman, said. 
 
 Locals said that they found all the three carcasses on Sunday. They bled to death of suffering injuries. A closer look at the   turtles showed injuries on their heads, strangulation marks and fatal wounds on flipper legs.
 
 Tourism officials at the Haritha Resorts were clueless about the incident but did acknowledge that it occurs once in a while at the shore.
 
 Recent reports reveal that the dead sea turtles being beached at the shore is not restricted to the Suryalanka beach alone as such incidents happen in other coastal districts in Andhra Pradesh as well. 
 
 Last year, at least two sea turtles were found at Manganipudi beach in Machilipatnam. “The sea turtles have a lifespan of 80 to 100 years across the coast. They die from injuries sustained when they are hit by boats,” K Srinivasulu, a private veterinary doctor in Vijayawada, told TOI. 
 
 Srinivasulu said the sea   does not have retractable heads like star tortoises and other breeds which makes them prone to head injuries. Unlike at major beaches, the concept of turtle walks are not prevalent on the AP coastline.
