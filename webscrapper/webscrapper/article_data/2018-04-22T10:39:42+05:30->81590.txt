NAGPUR: Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association ( ) has pulled the plug on all protests and boycott calls regarding   evaluation citing progress in their talks with the state government over pending issues.

 Ashok  , general secretary of VJUCTA, said “From April 17, discussions with the state have moved forward and are on track. Our members have almost finished the evaluation process and I can guarantee that there won’t be any delay in declaration of results.”
 
 VJUCTA, along with its state-level counterpart, had been withholding statement of marks from the board office as part of their on going process. “The statement of marks is prepared by us after evaluation and is submitted to the board office. While we were continuing with the evaluation process, we had not submitted the statement of marks as part of our protests,” said Gavhankar. 
 
 He confirmed that submission of statement of marks has now started and added that VJUCTA members are sticking to the deadline. “HSC results won’t be delayed at all because the evaluation process is 99% complete. We started about 10 days late but there really isn’t much to worry about because as of today, things are on track,” said Gavhankar. 
 
 There are around two dozen demands of junior college teachers, important ones being related to salary and pension. While the issues have not been completely resolved, Gavhankar said it won’t make sense to drag the issue any longer.
 
 “The government has shown that it does not care for students, but we do. While we will continue to fight with the government over unfulfilled promises, we won’t put the future of students at stake because of that. Carrying the protest further will mean that results will get delayed and our students may loose out academically because admission season starts shortly,” said Gavhankar.
