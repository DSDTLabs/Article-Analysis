The shoot for Sanjay Dutt’s biopic is on in full swing and has become one of the highly anticipated films, all thanks to a series of pictures of leading man   sharing an uncanny resemblance with the senior actor. The biopic will reportedly not only touch upon the actor's professional life, his trials, tribulations, but will also give fans a peek into his love-life. While actresses like Sonam Kapoor and   have been roped in to play his love interests, reports state that   had approached director   to remove any reference to her alleged link-up with the actor.

 If the reports are to be believed then, actress Karishma Tanna was supposed to play the dancing diva on-screen, but director Hirani decided to adhere to Madhuri's request. 
 
 According to latest reports, the ‘Dhak dhak’ girl was approached to share her thoughts on the same. She brushed these reports off saying, that her life has come a long way since then and that the topic was now “redundant”. She also admitted that she wasn't aware where these reports were springing up from but insisted that it didn't make any difference to her. 
 
 The Dutt biopic will reportedly see Dia Mirza playing's Sanjay’s wife Maanayata Dutt while Sonam Kapoor is believed to be an amalgamation of the actor's former girlfriends in the early 90's. Manisha Koirala, on the other hand, will play his late mother Nargis.
