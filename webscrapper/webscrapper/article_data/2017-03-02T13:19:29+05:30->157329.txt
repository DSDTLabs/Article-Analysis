NAGPUR: The   (IUCN) has released Rs 3 crore to the state forest department as first instalment of the Rs14 crore project for ‘Integrated habitat conservation &   in   landscape’.

 The agreement between IUCN and   (MFD) was signed on December 6, 2016. The two-year project ending on December 31, 2018, will include small and big NGOs working in wildlife conservation field. The total approved project budget is Rs14 crore.
 
 On July 1, 2015, TOI was the first to report how the project seeks to invest in improving the management of tiger habitats, tackling man-animal conflict, increasing anti-poaching and law enforcement efforts, and engaging and actively involving local communities in tiger conservation.
 
 N Rambabu, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF) for wildlife (east), said the project was discussed during a meeting on December 9, 2016.
 
 “We have identified five NGO partners to execute the project. It has been decided that the project implementation is to be focused in   (WII) identified tiger corridor landscape and villages categorized as ‘critical’ and ‘high’ therein,” said Rambabu.
 
 The first call for concepts was launched in October 2014, and resulted in a number of concepts being received from across nine countries eligible for funding under this programme. These included India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao, Myanmar, Nepal, and Vietnam.
 
 The concepts were submitted by some very strong partnerships between NGOs, government departments and local communities and were innovative and of high quality. Competition was fierce and unfortunately not all proposals could be funded.
 
 The project was initiated by IUCN in 2014 with funding from the German government. It funds projects on the conservation of wild tiger populations, their habitats and on the sustainable development of livelihoods of human communities living in and around key tiger habitats.
