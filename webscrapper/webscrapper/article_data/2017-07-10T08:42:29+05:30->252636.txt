MANILA: A 5.9-magnitude   on Monday rocked a central Philippine island still reeling from a deadly tremor last week, though there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties, seismologists said.

 The   said the moderately strong quake struck Leyte island near Ormoc, a city of about 200,000 people, at 9:41am (local time) at a relatively shallow depth of 12.7 kilometres (eight miles).
 
 A 6.5 quake stuck the region on Thursday last week, killing two people and leaving 72 others injured.
 
 Large areas of Leyte, home to some 1.75 million people, and some parts of the central   were still without electricity this week due to damage to a Leyte power plant.
 
 The Philippines lies on the so-called Ring of Fire, a vast   region where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur.
