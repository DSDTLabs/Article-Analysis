 Anand, who is currently seen in the show May I Come In Madam?, has not visited his hometown for the last two years due to his shooting schedule. Unfortunately, the actor who was planning to go on a holiday to his hometown had to make a quick and indefinite trip to  , because his grandmother is not keeping well. He said, "Two years of continuous shooting had taken a toll on my health mentally and physically. It also gets monotonous to continue doing the same role for a long time. I had wanted to come for   to Ujjain, but my grandmother became so unwell and she is 97. So she felt that I should see her."
The makers have again changed the track to accommodate Sandeep's leave. He will go missing from the show for two weeks.
