QUEPEM: Residents of Quepem town on Tuesday halted the laying of water supply pipelines by the state government through funds from the Japan International Cooperation Agency ( ). They were protesting the unplanned digging along the middle of the   highway.

 The Rs 131-crore pipeline project for south Goa was started five years ago, but was subsequently abandoned when corruption allegations surfaced involving former ministers and bureaucrats. Work on the pipeline and water reservoirs in Quepem itself accounts for Rs 29 crore of the total cost of the project.
 
 After a five-year gap, the PWD resumed the work, but residents are irked with the continuous disruption of water supply as well as the   broadband internet services.
 
 They said that water pipeline and telephone cables have been damaged during the digging. Local resident  , and former  ,   flayed the government for allowing road digging after its hot mixing was complete.
