NAVI MUMBAI: Despite the   placing a ‘No Parking’ board near  ,   can be seen illegally   their vehicles in the zone. 

 Most of these parked vehicles belong to doctors and staffers of the hospital. Some of the vehicles also belong to relatives of patients admitted in the hospital. 
 
 NMMC said the no-parking board had been installed as per the directions of the traffic department which after conducting a survey had declared both sides of the Mini Seashore road as No-Parking zone.
 
 DCP (traffic) Nitin Pawar said, “The concerned hospital should have provided parking facility for its doctors and staffers in the premises. But due to lack of parking facility, motorists visiting the hospital are compelled to park their vehicles on the roadside. During the survey it was found that private vehicles are being parked on both sides of the Mini Seashore road. Private vehicles were occupying space for parking of school buses and ambulances.” 
 
 Vehicles in the No Parking zone are regularly towed away but motorists continue to park here, Pawar said. “The citizens need to be more civilized and must abide by traffic rules,” he said. 
 
 NMMC executive engineer (Vashi) Arvind Shinde said it was the traffic department’s duty to ensure that vehicles were not parked there.
