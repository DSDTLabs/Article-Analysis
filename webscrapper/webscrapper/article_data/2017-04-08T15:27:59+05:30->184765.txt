 Moradabad: Stray dogs continue to be a menace in Kundarki block. On Wednesday, a four-year-old girl was attacked by a pack in Kundarki and two other children were mauled at Majholie village. All the three victims were admitted to hospital.   In March, strays killed a seven-year-old girl at Murdapur village, bringing the toll to 11 in 12 months.    Now, residents have turned for help to their local MlA, Haji Rizwan (SP). He has decided to raise the matter in the assembly.    Speaking with TOI, Rizwan, said, “Corrupt officials give us false assurances after each incident of stray dogs’ attack. The menace is taking a heavy toll on human lives, particularly of children. The administration must take proper measures to stop the canine threat and panic among residents.”    Abdul Basit, SDM, said, “The rising incidents of dog attacks indicate that the canines here may have developed a habit of eating human flesh and find it easy to prey on children.”
