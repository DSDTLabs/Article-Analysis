HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu   downplayed the   decision to expedite hearing of the two-year-old cash-for-vote scam.

 The case rallies around Naidu’s role in alleged bribing of a TRS associate MLA for getting him to cross vote for the   nominee in the MLC elections in May 2015.
 
 Speaking to reporters at the assembly in Amravati, the CM said several cases have been filed by his opponents in the past.
 
 “What is new in the apex court deciding to hear this case? They (opposition) have filed 26 cases in total. They filed cases even after some of them were quashed in the courts. That’s the only work they have,” he said.
 
 Recalling an excise case filed against him, Naidu said that it took 12 years for the case to be repealed. “What is there in the case to be filed? Even in the past there were cases in the apex court, but nothing has happened. I suggest you leave it (the case),” he said.
