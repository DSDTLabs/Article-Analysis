Nicole Wellwood, mother of Evan Leversage, is expected to be present in Kolkata for the special screening of Srijit Mukherji’s ‘Uma’ in June. ‘Uma’ will also release at three film festivals in Canada later this year.

  
 Srijit’s upcoming drama is inspired by Leversage’s story. The film stars Sara Sengupta,  , Anjan Dutt,   and   in key roles.
 
 ‘Uma’ narrates a similar story about a little girl (Sara Sengupta) suffering from a terminal disease. She wants to visit Kolkata, for the last time, to witness Durga Puja in autumn. But her father (Jisshu Sengupta) is in a fix because it’s only the month of March and the little girl doesn’t have much time left. So, her father contacts a relatively unsuccessful filmmaker (Anjan Dutt) in order to recreate Durga Puja with his crew.
 
 According to reports,   was initially skeptical about ‘Uma’ when Srijit approached her, as she was then still recovering from the shock of her son's death (Leversage died on December 6, 2015). Later in an interview, the grieved mother allegedly added that she believed in Srijit and was literally convinced.
