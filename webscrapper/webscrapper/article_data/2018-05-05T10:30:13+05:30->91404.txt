HYDERABAD: One of the major demands of the government employees to lift ban on transfers and allow general transfers may not be accepted by the government in view of the gigantic task of distribution of cheques to farmers as part of Rs 12,000 crore   crop investment support scheme.

 
 Top sources said government employees’ participation is key for the successful implementation of the much-touted scheme and allowing transfers at this juncture could put the scheme in jeopardy. Sources said the demand for general transfers will have to wait until the cheque distribution exercise is completed.
 
 But there is a possibility of a delegation of leaders of various employees and officers’ associations meeting chief minister   on Sunday after the second day’s meeting of the cabinet sub-committee with teachers and their associations on Saturday. Cabinet sub-committee chairman   told reporters after the first day’s meeting and discussion with   gazetted officers (TGOs) and non-gazetted officers associations that the association leaders have put forth their demands and that the cabinet sub-committee would meet teachers and their leaders and submit a report to the CM.
 
 TGOs and TNGOs leaders said the cabinet sub-committee had assured them of positively considering all the 18-demands, mainly the abolition of contributory pension scheme and reverting to old pension scheme, allowing general transfers, constituting pay revision committee and bringing back the employees hailing from Telangana but working in  , among others.
