CHANDIGARH: The worst-ever money crisis of the municipal corporation has forced it to halt most of its works and put aside approved projects worth Rs 100 crore. Contractors have abandoned   worth Rs 40 crore over issues of payment, Rs 30 crore of which has been stopped.

 The civic body’s fast-depleting fixed-deposit (FD) reserves have dipped below Rs 50 crore. The works that have come to a halt are re-carpeting of 350-odd kilometers of road, installation of paver blocks and tiles, raising the boundary walls of parks, and building several community centres. Re-carpeting has been the most-affected work this year because of a shortage of money. A source in the   said: “Passed items on the developmental agenda from previous meetings of the house remain on the desks of senior officers. Of two of six development-related items that came up in the last of these monthly house meetings, the house could pass neither before it was adjourned.”
 
 An MC official said: “The corporation has about Rs 40 crore of unavoidable liability in the shape of employees’ salaries and payment of bills for various services. Since our grant-in-aid and sources of revenue are both limited, we are left with no option but to stop dozens of projects we had no money to execute. We are continuing only extremely crucial works, in bits and pieces.” Sources in the civic body said its chief accounts officer (CAO) had written to the wings and contractors concerned to work within constraints.
 
 Unable to sanction any new work, senior MC officials have ordered the engineering department to pass them only the most urgent files, where the work involved is so unavoidable that delaying it will have a serious impact on public life.
