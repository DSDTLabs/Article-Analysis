Long hours of abstinence from food and water by the devout during the day in  , the Islamic month of fasting, would not cause disordered eating (DE) behaviour, reveals a research study. This is because people, who are on fast, do not fall to temptation of food. This guards the devout from DE behaviour.

  
 Ramzan fasting has always aroused curiosity among scientists and doctors and every year scores of research studies are conducted to decode the mystery of fasting and how it impacts the human health and behaviour.
 
 An international team of researchers studied the impactof   on DE behaviour of individuals. The study gains significance as people, who stay away from food or cut down calorie intake as part of weight-loss regimen, suffer from disordered eating behaviour.
 
 The researcherswantedto know if fasting during Ramzan, too, would lead to disordered eating behaviour, as in the case of weight-loss regimen.
 
 The researchers noted that, “While dietary restriction for health or appearancerelated reasons was a known contributor to DE, dietary restriction for religious purposes, such as that observed during Ramzan, may not confer increased riskof DEsymptoms.”
 
 The resultof thestudy was published in the latest issue of the international science journal, Appetite. The researchers were drawn from various research institutes and universities in Australia and  .
 
 Health experts from Hyderabad corroborated the research findings.
 
 “Dietary restriction contributes to disordered eating behaviours and associated cognitions. However, it is unclear how these outcomes are impacted by dietary restriction for religious purposes, such as fasting observed by Muslimsduring Ramzan,” the researchers said. The study was based on ecological momentary assessment system.
