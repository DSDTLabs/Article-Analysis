LUCKNOW: Even while the entire opposition lashed out severely at UP government for its order to change the name of dalit icon Dr   as Dr   in all government records, the opposition too, including   party, when in government had used his full name on stamps at least twice. 

 Commemorating the 25th anniversary of India's independence in 1973, the Central government under PM   had released a 20 paise stamp on Ambedkar using his full name, written in Hindi.
 
 Again in 1991, the   government, supported by Congress, issued another stamp, this time to commemorate  's birth centenary on April 14. 
 
 While welcoming the Yogi government's decision to use Ambedkar's full name, Governor Ram Naik said that it was he who had proposed before the then PM   for this stamp which carried full name 'Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar' in Hindi and   in English. 
 
 Congress MP PL Punia said that there was a huge difference between using Ambedkar's full name on a stamp and using it for political gains, which is what he accused BJP of doing.
