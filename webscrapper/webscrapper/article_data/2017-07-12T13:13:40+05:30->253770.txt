PUNE: The   (PMRDA) is aiming to complete the 23-km PMRDA metro line from Hinjewadi to Shivajinagar within two years’ after the bid for executing the   (PPP) model is finalised in August.

 After visiting and surveying Hyderabad metro project (on which the PMRDA metro is likely to be based), Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) chief Kiran Gitte told TOI that he was confident of completing the project in two years’, after the bid is finalised. 
 
 “The length of the Hyderabad metro is 75 km while our metro extends to 23 km. The authorities at Hyderabad metro were given five years to complete the project but it got delayed because of land acquisition issue. However, in our case I am confident of completing the project within two years,’’ said Gitte after reviewing the project in great detail.
 
 He said that the Hyderabad project largely looked at fuelling growth along the corridor, which would be replicated in the   along the corridor will be one of the major aspects of funding. It was only last week that the PMRDA had sought approval for 20 per cent of central funds for viability gap funding for the metro project.
 
 “The Hyderabad metro is an overhead metro and it has also townships on monetised lands, which will be replicated in the PMRDA model. The Hyderabad metro has fuelled growth along the entire metro corridor and the PMRDA wants to roll out the metro on similar lines,’’ stated the PMRDA chief.
 
 He further added that the major land acquisition for the car shed comprising 50 acres had gained momentum while another 50 acres will be acquired in the future. When asked about an extension of the metro line as is the case by MahaMetro, he said that they did have plans to extend the metro to all the Hinjewadi phases as the purpose of the metro is to enable people to travel to work.
