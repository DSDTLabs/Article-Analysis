Excitement turned into chaos when   and   stepped into   Uppal to promote their movie   on Saturday, forcing the actors to make an early exit. What seemed like a manageable number of fans turned into a huge boisterous crowd when the preparations to host the actors drew the regular movie-goers to the scene. And once the two actors arrived, the crowd went berserk. The security personnel were outnumbered as the people grappled with each other to get a closer look at the stars.
As the actors took to the stage to greet the gathering, a few excited folks even made their way on to the stage. This was cut short to 20 seconds, as the security personnel opted to shepherd Adah and Vidyut into the hall where the trailer of Commando 2 was to be screened.
 More commotion ensued inside as movie-goers demanded: “Where’s my seat?” as a couple of rows were cordoned off for the actors. 
 As they tried to exit from the back door, the actors were again hounded by fans, who broke through the security line. Irked by the fans’ behaviour, the bouncers had no choice but to escort the stars to the lift immediately. That only backfired as the doors of lift wouldn’t close due to the over-crowding. Making the most of the delay, another fan, shouted: “You are better than Salman Khan! You are physically fit!” as Vidyut awkwardly struggled to accept the compliment. Soon the doors shut, and the actors were whisked away.
