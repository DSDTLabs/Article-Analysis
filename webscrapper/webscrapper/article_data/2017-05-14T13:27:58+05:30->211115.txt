 Officials from Indore office of Enforcement Directorate (ED) produced Choudhary after the 10 day remand ended.

 “The court has given us permission to inspect the documents on the grounds of arrest as furnished by ED as well as take notes of it while being present in the courtroom on May 17,” Vyas said.
 
 During the proceedings, Choudhary raised objections over the way ED interrogated him. He told the court about an ex-ED official who interrogated him from May 5 to 9 for some ‘vested interests’.
 
 The court asked Choudhary to submit whatever he wanted to say in writing which he did.
 
 Outside the courtroom, an argument ensued between Choudhary and cops over him being taken to jail in a van. Choudhary first insisted on an SUV car brought by his acquaintance to take him to the jail. However, cops were adamant and he had to use the van.
