PATNA:   seems to have marred the business at the ten-day Gandhi   with few visitors visiting the exhibition-cum-sale at the city’s   on Saturday.
 
  The fair, organized by the Union ministry of textiles, opened on March 30 and will conclude on April 8. An annual affair, it is usually organised in November or December, but was deferred this year due to non-availability of the ground as its venue owing to different programmes organised by the state government.
  
  This reporter during a visit to the fair on Saturday noon saw the traders sitting idle while the hot sun rays fell directly on their makeshift stalls made of tarpaulins. The day temperature was around 35 degree Celsius at that time.
  
  “The business has been dull on all three days so far,” a stall owner from Maharashtra regretted, adding it was difficult for even them to sit at the stalls as the organisers had not cared to install even fans in the stalls.
  
  To make the situation worse, especially for   owners and visitors, the entire venue does not have even one lavatory. “We leave the shop at God’s mercy when we go to pee in the open,” said a male stall owner.
  
  At least 79 participants from across the country have brought their products for sale at the 150 stalls at the fair. They are from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Haryana, Delhi, Odisha, Jammu & Kashmir, West Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar.
  
  The Union government’s assistant director (handicrafts development),  , told this reporter the complaints about the lack of facilities would be addressed soon.
