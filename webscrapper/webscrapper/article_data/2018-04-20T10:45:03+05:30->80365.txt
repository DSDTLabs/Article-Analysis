NEW DELHI: The rapid pace of access to banking in India has helped push global numbers, where seven out of every 10 adults have a bank account, driven by access to mobile phone and other technologies, the   said on Thursday.

 
 In India, bank account ownership has more than doubled to 80% in six years. The Global Findex Report noted that the number of accountholders in the country has risen steadily — from 35% of the adults in 2011 to 53% in 2014 and 80% in 2017. The government has argued that financial inclusion programme has gained traction since the Jan Dhan accounts were launched after the   swept to power in May 2014.
 
 Although the number of unbanked has come down, there are still around 1.7 billion such people globally, with seven countries, including India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mexico and  , accounting for half of them. Despite the Jan Dhan focus, India is estimated to have 190 million unbanked people, next only to China, where 225 million adults have no access to banking.
 
 On the flip side, only 7% of the account holders used them for savings and 48% of the accounts remained inactive, the highest in the world.
 
 “Part of the explanation might be India’s   scheme, developed by the government to increase account ownership. Launched in August 2014, the programme had brought an additional 310 million Indians into the formal banking system by March 2018, many of whom might not yet have had an opportunity to use new account,” the report said.
 
 Although more people have access to banking in India now, cash is still the dominant mode of payment.
