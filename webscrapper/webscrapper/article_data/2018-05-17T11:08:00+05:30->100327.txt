PUNE: An unidentified man duped a 69-year-old man of Rs 6,000 on the pretext of helping him deposit the money in the cash deposit machine at an ATM kiosk of a public sector bank near Market Yard around 1.30pm on Tuesday.

 A complaint in this regard was lodged by Mulchand Sharma, a resident of Mahesh Society in Bibvewadi, with the Swargate police. 
 
 Sub-inspector   of the Swargate police station told TOI that Sharma had gone to the ATM centre with Rs 19,000, which he was supposed to deposit in his son’s bank account. 
 
 Chaus said Sharma placed the currency notes in the cash deposit slot of the machine and completed the necessary formalities. However, the cash placed in the slot was not being accepted by the machine. 
 
 “An unidentified person who was standing behind Sharma told him that the machine was not accepting the cash as he had not arranged the currency notes in a proper manner,” Chaus said, adding that the man offered to help Sharma in arranging the currency notes properly. 
 
 An ususpecting Sharma then handed over the cash of Rs 19,000 to the person. “The man pretended to count the notes and again placed them in the cash deposit slot. But when the machine did not accept the notes for a second time, Sharma started counting the money again and that is when he realised that Rs 6,000 of the total 19,000 had gone missing,” Chaus said.
 
 Before Sharma could ask the unidentified man about the missing currency notes, he had disappeared from the kiosk. “Sharma has given us the description of the suspect and we have also asked the bank authorities to provide us the footage of the CCTV camera which is placed inside the kiosk,” Chaus said.
