CHENNAI: The government pays   who teach in medical colleges less than it does teachers in state-run veterinary, agriculture and arts and science colleges, the   said here on Monday.

 A doctor who teaches starts with a   that is Rs 600/month lower and, by the time they get their first promotion in their eighth year in service, an arts or veterinary medicine teacher has already received at least two promotions.
 
 In a 26-page document released to the media, the association has demanded pay parity with central government doctors, time-bound promotions, similar work-based allowances and retirement age.
 
 The salary for doctors in state and central services is the same when they join duty, but doctors in central government services receive promotions in four, nine, 13 and 20 years, compared to eight, 15, 17 and 20 years in the state government, association state president Dr K Senthil said.
 
 A doctor joining government medical service receives receives Rs 15,600 + Rs 5,400 as basic salary when he joins and net pay of close to Rs 40,000. They also get a 3% raise in basic pay every year. After nearly 10 years of service and one promotion in eight years, a government doctor receives a salary of Rs 42,949 with a basic of Rs 17,930 + Rs 5,400, dearness allowance of Rs 24,963 and   of Rs 3,000.
 
 A government doctor in a medical college teaches medical students and provides supplementary supports in patient care. “The special pay they get every month is just Rs 100,” a senior government medical college doctor said.
 
 “[There are] such gross differences in pay between Centre and state because teachers in state-run medical colleges are denied   or AICTE pay scales,” he said.
