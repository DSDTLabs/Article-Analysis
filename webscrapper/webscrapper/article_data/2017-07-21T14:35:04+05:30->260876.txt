CHANDIGARH: The   on Thursday verbally asked the Haryana government to inform if a tribunal could be constituted to probe the controversy related to transfer of ownership of land belonging to village panchayat of Gwal Pahari in   to private parties.

 HC also suggested the state to explore if such tribunal can also include all similar disputes related to the title of government properties in the state.
 
 The division bench headed by   of the HC made these observations during the resumed hearing of an ongoing petition seeking CBI probe into the alleged irregularities in the ownership of 464-acre worth around Rs 3,000 crore land of Gwal Pahari area of Gurugram.
 
 The matter would now come up for further hearing on August 3.
 
 Earlier on May 4, the HC had observed that the land belonging to Gwal Pahari village in Gurugram is admittedly shamlat (common village land) land and the state should make all endeavours to restore it with the municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) whom the land was entrusted in 2010 from the panchayat.
 
 “Everyone is in loot of shamlat land. Admittedly land belongs to Shamlat land. Even proceedings under section 408 of the Municipal Act need to be initiated by the authorities to remove encroachment from the land and high court would monitor it,” HC had observed orally.
 
 The matter has reached before the HC in the wake of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Harinder Dhingra, a resident of Gurgaon seeking directions to hand over the matter to CBI for investigations.
 
 Petitioner wanted probe into the sanction of mutation number 3,112 in respect of said land, which was earlier vested in gram panchayat Gwal Pahari, since the year 1940-41, and in the MCG from March 2010.
