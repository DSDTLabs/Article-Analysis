  :   of   on Thursday launched a protest against the Union labour ministry's proposal to do away with 'cash and kind' wages and replace it with 'cash only' payments to be deposited in workers' bank accounts. 

 Former Union minister and Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha (ACMS) president Paban Singh Ghatowar led around 7,000 tea garden workers in a rally at Lahowal here. The protesters marched along NH-37 up to Dikom where they blocked the highway for nearly half an hour.
 
 During a visit to Guwahati on January 5, Union labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya had revealed that the Centre was planning to scrap the British-era 'cash and kind' payment system by amending the Plantation Labour Act, 1951. Under it, the wages of garden workers here comprise cash as well as ration, firewood, tea, mosquito nets, slippers, healthcare and educational services. 
 
 "There is no clarity on whether the value of ration would be calculated at the subsidized rate of 50p per kg or at the current market value of Rs 25. If the amount is transferred at the subsidized rate, workers will be the ultimate losers. Since there is every chance of them using the money to buy liquor or other useless things, there may be starvation in many families," said   general secretary  .
