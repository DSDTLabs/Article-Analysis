GHAZIABAD: In an advisory issued on Sunday, the traffic police has urged commuters to stick to the rules and regulations on the 10.5km-long   and stop taking wrong turns. Those coming from Delhi side will have to drive all the way to   Extension and then take a U-turn to reach Indirapuram and adjoining areas, the advisory said.

 The ramp on the   side is meant only to approach the elevated road and move towards Raj Nagar Extension and not vice-versa. Likewise, the ramp on Kanawani side is meant only to get down at Indirapuram, the police said.
 
 The advisory has been issued after many commuters were found taking wrong turns at the ramps on both Kanawani and Vasundhara sides to avoid travelling a longer distance to reach their destinations in Indirapuram and adjoining areas.
 
 SP (traffic) S N Singh said, “In the first two days, many people who claimed to be unaware of the rules, fought with our staff and insisted on taking wrong turns. Now we are not going to allow any such thing. We have issued an advisory explaining the rules.”
 
 “There is a need to install permanent speed radars on the stretch. However, till the time we get such a facility, we will use speed-detectors. We are in the process of getting at least 10 speed-detectors for the city. The offenders will be issued e-challans. Moreover, we will send copies of challans to the offenders’ addresses on the basis of their vehicle registration number,” the SP said.
 
 Traffic inspector Ramesh Tiwari said, “As many as five constables have been deployed on the stretch for smooth traffic movement. While two cops each will be posted on both ends of the two ramps to stop people from taking any  , one constabale will be present at the Rajnagar Extension rotary to manage the traffic. The system will be in place till 10 pm, after which local police will patrol the area. Commuters who are found driving in wrong directions will be challaned.”
