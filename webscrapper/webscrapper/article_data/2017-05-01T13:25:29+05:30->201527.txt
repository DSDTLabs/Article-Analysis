 "I received a call from a man who introduced himself as an employee of the head office of State Bank. He said my card was to be revalidated and convinced me by sharing the transactions. Within minutes, I got nine back to back messages about money being debited,'' said Murari Lal, adding that he was harassed by police and bankers .
 
 The second case is that of former employee of Haryana Khadi and  . Lal  , a resident of Sector 12 was duped of Rs 4,8888 between January and February 13 this year. He was also approached by a caller who sought card details. A week after the complaint, Chauhan got an auto-credit of Rs 5,000 from the bank.
