HYDERABAD: When the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) mooted the idea of waste segregation, it also decided to hire Community Resource Persons (CRPs) to spread awareness on the issue. While the idea of CRPs may have been a sound one, discrepancies in the   records have left activists smelling a rat. 

 Till date, the civic body has enlisted 2,100 CRPs. Enquiries however reveal that several remain only on paper. In fact, when contacted, some designated CRPs didn't even know that their names had been listed. 
 
 Prasanna, listed as a CRP from  , said, "The GHMC did not inform us about the programme and I didn't even know my name had been listed as a CRP or Swachh Dooth. Since I visit the Urban Community Development (UCD) wing regularly, they might have included my name."
 
 
  
 
 An Asha worker, Uma, from   circle and a resident of  , said she too has not participated in the awareness programme till date. "The civic body asked to perform the duty in  , to which I did not agree," she said. 
 
 The GHMC is to pay CRPs 10,000 in two or three instalments on fulfilment of their job requirements. This, activists feel could be the beginnings of a scam. Some allege that in the future, money could be siphoned off under the guise of payment to these 'on paper CRPs'. "Timely action should be taken in order to avoid loss of public money," said  , a senior   activist.
 
 GHMC officials said money to CRPs will only be paid after a inspection. "To ensure zero wastage of money, we thoroughly cross-check the number of households inspected by the CRPs before paying them," said civic chief B Janardhan Reddy.
