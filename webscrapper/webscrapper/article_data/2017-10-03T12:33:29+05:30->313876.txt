HYDERABAD: Senior   leader and former MP V   on Monday said he will write to Prime Minister   to ensure that action is taken against the corrupt ministers and officers of the K   Rao-led government.

 He charged Chnadrasekhar Rao with silence on crucial issues such as Miyapur land scam, drugs cases involving film stars and land grabbing by gangster Nayeem and asked why no serious action was taken.
 
 Stating that   has no moral right to talk about checking corruption through a land survey, the Congress leader said the CM should first set his own office right before acting on others.
 
 “There are leaders and IAS officers involved in corruption cases who are working in the TRS government. Some of them are working in the ministries or on portfolios being handled by KCR and his son  . Action should be taken against them,” Hanumantha Rao said.
