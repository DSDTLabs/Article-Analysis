Panaji: Congress on Sunday attacked chief minister Manohar   after he attended the swearing-in ceremony of Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Yogi Adityanath. The party accused Parrikar of leaving important tasks in Goa mid-way to attend the ceremony of Yogi Adityanath, who is regarded as a controversial figure.

  “It is surprising that despite having multiple issues like road accidents, murders, the Supreme Court’s order on liquor stores, the licence of casinos and portfolios to be distributed to ministers, the government has come to a standstill after the election results. Instead of attending to these issues, the chief minister has gone to Uttar Pradesh to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Yogi Adityanath, who is known for his loose remarks against the minorities,” party spokesperson Girish Chodankar said.
 
 Highlighting the fact that a majority of BJP MLAs are from the minority community, Congress demanded for their reaction on Parrikar’s visit to Uttar Pradesh.
 
 “They (MLAs from the minority community) claim to be champions of secularism and should come out and give their reaction on the chief minister’s visit. Vijai Sardesai should also share his reaction as he also claims to be the protector of minorities.”
