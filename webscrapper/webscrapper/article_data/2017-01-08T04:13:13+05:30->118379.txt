 Many commuters have complained that travelling on the 5-km stretch between Rabale and Mahape has been a nightmare since the ban was imposed last week.
 
 Commuters travelling to Panvel and beyond also have to use private transport as heavy vehicles and buses on Belapur-bound carriageway are being diverted either to internal service roads or MIDC Road from Rabale.
 
 “One has to take a taxi or auto to cross the stretch at Mahape and catch public transport buses for onward journey. The taxi and auto operators are charging exorbitant rates in the absence of public transport buses. Authorities should find some solution,” said a Ghansoli resident Sujay Nath.
 
 MMRDA sources said that the underpass work will continue till May, which means commuters have to face the inconvenience for the next five months.
 
 Shirish Aradwad, NMMT manager, said that they are aware of the inconvenience caused to commuters due to the no-entry for buses. “The decision to put up a low-height barrier at Rabale was taken by the traffic wing. Thus, trucks and buses cannot use the stretch. I will speak to traffic authorities, seeking relaxation on the ban on buses as our regular commuters are genuinely inconvenienced,” he added.
 
 Even the traffic department has assured that they will take steps to rectify the situation. “We have made a few changes in the diversion routes over the last one week. We will now ensure that commuters are less inconvenienced,” said  , traffic inspector of Rabale.
