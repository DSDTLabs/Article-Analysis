 Yathindra had come under the scanner in April 2016 after TOI published a report on how Matrix Imaging Solutions India had bagged the government-owned PMSSY Hospital's tender for setting up a super-specialty diagnostic lab at Victoria Hospital, Bengaluru. Announced in 2013, the Prime Minister's Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) was unveiled in year 2003 to correct the regional imbalances in the delivery of health services. Since Yathindra's company was the sole bidder , the issue had raised questions of probity and conflict of interest
