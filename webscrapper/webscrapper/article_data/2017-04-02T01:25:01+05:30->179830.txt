Thane: After sweating it out for almost a week, residents from the lake city finally got some respite on Saturday as the maximum temperatures, which had touched 43.1 degrees Celsius last week, dropped by a few notches—almost eight degrees.

 Since the last few days, the temperatures has been hovering between 38 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees Celsius during the day. Even the night time   wasn’t pleasant, giving many residents sleepless nights.
 
  levels had also risen in the city. However, on Saturday there was slight cloud cover which protected residents from the harsh sun rays.
 
 The maximum temperature dropped to 34.3 degrees Celsius on Saturday and the minimum temperature was around 26 degrees Celsius.
 
 Rishika Shetty (26), a resident from Upvan, said, “The weather had become unbearable last week. Stepping out in the afternoon was just impossible because of the  . Despite living in an area which has plenty of forest cover, we had to switch on the air condition even in the day. Now, finally the weather has become a bit better.”
 
 However, officials from the weather department said that the low temperature will be short lived and the mercury levels will rise again in another two to three days. 
 
 Mahesh Palawat, chief meteorologist at skymetweather, said, “Since the last few days, the mercury levels soared because of the hot north-westerly winds as well as the humid winds from the Arabian sea blowing towards the western and coastal areas. Since Saturday there has been some clouding in parts of Gujarat and in the coastal and western area, which blocks the sun’s rays. However, this temperature will remain low for around two days before it rises again.”
 
 While they predict that the rest of the month will be warmer than usual, they assert that the pre-monsoon activity will begin earlier than usual (in May). “April will be warmer than usual. But, the pre-monsoon activities may begin a bit early this year,” Palawat added.
