HYDERABAD: Brushing aside Telangana’s objections on linking the Godavari and Cauvery rivers, the Centre is going ahead with its own plan, leaving the state government fuming.

 The Centre has decided to follow  , as per which Godavari waters will be tapped at Polavaram in Andhra Pradesh instead of Akinepalli in Kothagudem district of Telangana.
 
 Union water resources ministry sources said water will be transferred from Godavari to Polavaram project via  . The ministry has also decided to move the water through steel pipes, not by canal, to reduce land acquisition and rehabilitation risks.
 
 The earlier plan was to lift 300 TMC ft of surplus water from Akinepalli barrage, take it downstream Inchampalli on Godavari and transfer it to Nagarjunasagar dam on Krishna and form there to Somasila Dam on   to the Cauvery.
 
 
 However, the TRS government opposed this, mooted linking of the   basin first and sought a fresh hydrology assessment on the overall availability of Godavari water.
 
 
 The Centre also made it clear that it is diverting Chhattisgarh’s quota of water and that Telangana should have no objections. “How can it be Chhattisgarh’s quota when the same would flow down to Telangana due to gravity. Whatever is available in  , we have a share and that can’t be denied by the Centre,” said Telangana irrigation department sources.
