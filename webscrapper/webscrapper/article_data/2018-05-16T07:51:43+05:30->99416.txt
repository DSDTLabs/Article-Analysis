LUCKNOW: The government on Tuesday cleared a proposal to implement an advanced traffic management system on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway. 

 The cabinet also took up the matter of nominating RITES for preparing the detailed project report and feasibility study of the   and sanctioned 484 posts for non-PG junior resident doctors.
 
 The cabinet approved the lowest tender of Rs 29.6 crore by   for building, operating and maintaining the infrastructure of Agra-Lucknow Expressway for five years. The work includes setting up outdoor equipment like emergency call box, CCTVs, PTZ cameras, ANPR-based speed informant system and automatic counter-cum-classifier. Control centres will be set up at three places along the expressway, along with speed measuring cameras and number plate readers. A mobile app will also be launched that will give real time information to expressway users. A decision was also taken to sanction 484 posts for non-PG junior resident doctors due to an increasing number of patients in medical colleges especially in Kanpur, Agra, Jhansi, Allahabad, Gorakhpur and Meerut. Sources said that along with an increase in number of patients, there was a rising number of altercations between relatives of patients and doctors, largely because of shortage of doctors. "This not just ruins the peace of a hospital, but also gives it a bad name. In light of this, the cabinet has sanctioned 484 posts for junior doctors," said sources.
 
 The government has also increased the penalty for violation of the Molasses Control Act of 1964. Saying that the penalty at present is extremely lax which allows people to evade law, the cabinet brought in major amendments on Tuesday. This includes increasing the penalty for violation from Rs 2,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Subsequent violations will lead to a fine of Rs 5,000 per day for each, up from Rs 100 at present.
