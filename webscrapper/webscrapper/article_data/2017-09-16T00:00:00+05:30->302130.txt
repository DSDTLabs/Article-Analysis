The trailer has already created a buzz, and now, we’ll have to see how the music fares in this commercial outing. Harris Jayaraj and Murugadoss are coming together after Thuppaki, the music of which, was quite decent. But will they be able to create some magic for this one? Well, the album begins with Boom Boom, rendered by  . We have already heard bits of the tune in the teaser, which created quite an impact. Though it has a few staple beats, Nikhita’s powerful singing enhances the tune. The guitar portions need a mention as they aide to the stylish turnout of the song. Ciciliya Ciciliya by Haricharan and Shakthisree Gopalan is a peppy duet. The song is well-arranged by Harris and the chorus portion is quite impressive, too. Hari and Shakthi simply breeze through with their flawless renditions. The usage of ‘Ciciliya Ciciliya’ is quite fun to listen. This one is sure to make it to the charts! Aali Aali by Brijesh Tripati Sandiliya, Harini and Sunitha Upadrashta is a folk number. The song doesn’t seem to have a proper flow. Also, a portion of it immediately reminds of you Randaka Randaka from Anniyan. It is from the second charanam that you get used this one. Though the tune isn’t that impressive, the singers do a good job. An OK-track, this one. Otrai Iravukkal by D Sathyaprakash, Christopher Stanley and Pravin Saivi is a slow song, which primarily built on voice and guitar. The usage of English lyrics (the usual boy head-over-heels with a girl) isn’t impressive, but it is Sathyaprakash’s Tamil portions that are likable. The album ends with SPYder On Mission — an off-shoot from Boom Boom. It isn’t too loud yet packs in the punch. Except for two songs, Harris doesn’t really up the magic quotient for SPYder.
