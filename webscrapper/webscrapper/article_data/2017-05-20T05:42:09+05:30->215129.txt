BENGALURU: Counting of the 1.44 lakh votes for the state   president's post will be taken up on Saturday; results are expected by late evening.

 It will be a day-long exercise since ballot papers were used for voting. In the four-cornered contest for the post, the fight narrowed down between   (nephew of Sindhanur MLA Hampannagouda Badarli) and K N Rajendra (Madhugiri MLA K N Rajanna's son). The other two aspirants were M Amruthraj and K Kemparaj.
 
 However, there have been complaints of rigging by supporters of all candidates. “We have filed complaints of ballot boxes being opened while being transported from other districts to Bengaluru, before the Foundation for Advanced Management of Elections (FAME), an NGO run by ex-election commissioners,“ party sources said. The Youth Congress president will have a tenure of three years.
 
 Meanwhile, in the results declared for districtunit committees, transport minister Ramalinga Reddy's daughter   has been elected vice-president of Bengaluru city and MLA N A Haris son Mohammed Haris general secretary. Raghuveer Gowda is the city president. In the districts, animal husbandry minister A Manju's son,  , has been elected Hassan district Youth Congress president.
