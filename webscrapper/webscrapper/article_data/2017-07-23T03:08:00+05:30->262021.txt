Panaji: The Association of All Goa Muslim Jamaats and the Council for Social Justice and Peace have criticized the government’s handling of the investigations into the desecrations stating that it was being conducted in a “simplistic manner”. The two associations in a statement released after the public meeting for peace on Saturday, alleged that there is a “pervasive hate campaign that is being systematically perpetrated in Goa by right wing forces at times with the command and at other times with the tacit acceptance of the government of Goa”.  Around 1,000 people attending the public meeting held at Azad Maidan in solidarity with minority groups in other parts of the country and to work for peace and harmony. Activist and writer Soter D’Souza said the government at the Centre was turning a blind eye to communalism. He said it was unlikely that Francis Pereira was the only one behind the desecrations, alleging that this was a typical pattern seen throughout the country where the blame in cases of communalism is pinned on a mentally unstable, drunken man or an ex-convict.   Dalit thinker and activist Chandrakant Jadav, social activist Sabina Martins, Asif Hussain, secretary Jamaat e Islami Hind, among others, also spoke at the meeting.
