 After a consensus, speaker Ram Niwas Goel announced that a six-member committee, chaired by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and including three AAP and two BJP MLAs, would take up the matter with the Centre. 
 
 AAP MLA Vishesh Ravi shared the plight of   who are finding it difficult to run their household with their salaries. “People don’t believe us when we tell them our salary. Those MLAs who have married recently and those who have children find it more difficult to manage with the existing pay,” he said, adding that MLAs who are unmarried are willing to stay so owing to the same reason. 
 
 In December 2015, the assembly had passed a Bill seeking 400% hike in the basic salaries of MLAs and ministers besides hefty increase in perks and allowances. Sisodia said the Bill was pending for approval with the Union home ministry. Sisodia moved a resolution to constitute a committee, which was passed with a voice vote in the house.
 
 AAP legislators Saurabh Bhardwaj, Sanjeev Jha and Praveen Kumar, and BJP legislators Om Prakash Sharma and Manjinder Singh Sirsa have been appointed members of the committee.
 
 While moving the resolution, Sisodia said the committee will meet home minister Rajnath Singh and request him to clear the Bill.
 
 As per a provision of the Bill, the basic salary of legislators would increase from the current Rs 12,000 to Rs 50,000 and their overall monthly pay would be around Rs 2.1 lakh as against Rs 88,000 currently.
