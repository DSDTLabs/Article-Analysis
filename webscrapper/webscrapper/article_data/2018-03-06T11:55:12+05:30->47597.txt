by Sara Naveed is the author's magnificent debut as a novelist. A Pakistani author who lives in Lahore, Sara takes us to her home city and makes us fall in love there with her simple yet touching story.

 The book is a love story between Zarish Munawwar and Ahmar Murad. Zarish is a college student in her early twenties who falls for her professor, Ahmar. The female protagonist is quite a brat, arrogant and used to getting her way. Her petulance and childish antics make reading from her perspective a little irritating in the beginning. But the beauty of the love story is seeing love change and humble her, bringing out in her a selflessness that was unimaginable at the beginning of the book. Ahmar too is changed by his love for her. He is free from the shackles of his past that had made him a hesitant lover.
