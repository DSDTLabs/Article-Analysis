CUTTACK:   today allowed the   district administration to declare the result of the 'No Confidence' vote against Anandpur civic body Chairperson   that was held in July last year.

 The result of the no trust vote was kept in abeyance for last five months as Jena had obtained a stay order on the result from the High Court.
 
 Earlier, a single-judge bench of the   had made a similar order on January 3 allowing the district administration to announce the result after vacating the stay.
 
 But the January 3 order of the HC was again challenged by Jena in a writ petition.
 
 The Division Bench of the HC headed by Chief Justice   today dismissed Jena's petition and allowed the district administration to declare the result of the no trust vote.
