KOLKATA: Rattled by the allegations of misbehaviour by the staff of AMRI Mukundapur, hospitals are pulling up socks to improve soft skills of both medical and non medical staff. While most private hospitals regularly conduct training on soft skills, they feel that they need to work on this harder on the face of increasing incidents of mob violence in hospitals.

 
 For example, Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals regularly conducts reviews, specially in cases where patients had complaints against the hospital. This helps them find opportunity for improvement while dealing with such cases in future.
 
 “Training are conducted regularly for medical and non medical staff on effective communication and behaviour towards patients and relatives,” said  , CEO of Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals.
 
 Hospital officials believe that talking to relatives of patients with compassion and patients in such times of crisis can prevent a situation from escalating. “When a family is grieving the death of a member, one should not be rude to them. Being indifferent to their trauma could escalate the problem. There is a clear instruction to our hospital employees to talk to such families with compassion.” said Dr  , chairman of Medica Superspecialty Hospital.
 
 Hospital administrators, though, felt that at times such incidents are preplanned so that the patients’ families get away without clearing the bill.
