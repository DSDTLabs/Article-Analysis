AHMEDABAD : There is no end of woes for   of   and his  , who were attacked by four persons of   on December 25, over cattle grazing. Babu has   on his ribs, legs and face, while Rekha sustained injuries on her legs and shoulder. 

 Police have nabbed the accused whose bail plea is pending before a local court in Una.
 
 The dalit family, which was already struggling to make ends meet, was financially devastated with their breadwinner hospitalized. They have begun to sell family jewellery to survive.
 
 Babu and his elder brother Premji are the only earning members of the family, but with Babu remaining hospitalized and Premji having to commute from Una to Rajkot daily, there's no one to earn money.
 
 Premji's wife Bhanu Sankhat, 50, and her daughter Hina, 20, have begun to start working as daily labourers in a groundnut mill so that the 10-member family can survive.
 
 "We could not sit idle with empty bellies, so I called in my married daughter, Hina, from Mumbai to work for some days here, so that we can survive," Bhanu said.
 
 "However, we earn Rs 400 a day and it is difficult to meet all expenses including those required to tend to Babu. So I had to sell my earrings and some silver ornaments at the throwaway price of Rs 5,000 to get some money," Bhanu said, adding, "We did not have any other option."
 
 She said that no social activist or political party leader have come to meet them after the incident, that had taken place merely 6 km from Mota Samadhiyala, where four dalits -Ashok, Vashram, Bechar and Ramesh Sarvaiya - had been mercilessly flogged by cow vigilantes on July 11.
 
 "The treatment is free in the Rajkot civil hospital, where Babu is hospitalized, but we have to bear the transportation costs from Una to Rajkot, food expenses, and survive the void created by lack of earning," said Bhanu.
