NEW DELHI: A 10-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her   for the past one year at her house in southeast Delhi’s Jamia Nagar. Police said the accused had shifted to the survivor’s house as his family had been staying in West Bengal. 

 He was arrested on Monday, almost a month after he went missing when a case was registered against him by the girl’s family. 
 
 The matter came to fore a month ago when the accused man had gone to meet his family at his native village in West Bengal. Since he was away, the girl, sensing an opportunity, told her mother about the abuse. Her father was later informed about the incident, after which the family informed the police and a case was registered. The accused had since then been evading arrest. 
 
 The girl’s father worked at a factory and whenever he and his wife were away from home, the man sexually abused the survivor. He even threatened to kill her and other members of her family if she let anyone know about it. “The girl said that her uncle had been abusing her since the last one year. She, however, never uttered a word, fearing that he might harm her and other members of the family,” said a senior police officer. 
 
 “After the case was registered, we formed teams to nab the accused,” added the officer. The man first refused to accept the charges against him, but later broke down and confessed about his involvement in the same. 
 
 Another such incident was reported in Mangolpuri on Saturday, where a 17-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by a 20-year-old youth. 
 
 The duo knew each other but when the girl refused to talk to him anymore, he sexually abused her.
