PATIALA: Thirteen years after three “ancient” paintings worth crores of rupees were found missing from   in Patiala in October 2004, police are yet to make breakthrough in the case.

 The miniature paintings of gods Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh were kept in a chamber of Qila Mubarak’s Ranwas building, and are suspected to have been stolen during the historical monument’s renovation by the   (ASI).
 
 A case was registered against unknown persons at the Kotwali Police station soon after. However, now the police are unaware of the case. The SHO of Kotwali, when contacted, said he would have to go through old files to ascertain the status of the case.
 
 Police sources maintained that the case had been “dumped as untraceable” and no one was investigating it as of today. The sources said as the police could not find any clues, the case could never be solved.
 
 According to caretakers at Qila Mubarak, there were four miniature paintings on all four corners of the painted chamber. One of them, of Guru  , had gone missing in 1996. This painting also could not be traced. It had been reported that one of the doors leading to the chamber had been bent to facilitate entry of people, and it was believed that the thieves could have entered the chamber using that door and walked away with the paintings.
