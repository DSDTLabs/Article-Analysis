 Officials, while talking to the media after Saturday’s meeting, said that the excise officials had shared crucial information with the NCB as the ongoing drugs case has inter-state ramifications.
 
 NCB zonal director, Sunil Kumar Sinha, who works from Bangalore, came to Hyderabad for the meeting, which was held in the NCB’s regional office in Attapur. They discussed issues such as imparting technical training to excise officials and shared the call data records of several people who have figured in the drug case.
 
 Later, Sinha told the media that in many cases, drugs like cocaine and LSD come from abroad. This has gone on unchecked for a long time as there is no mechanism to check international passengers at the time of arrival at their destination.
 
 “Many drugs cases were cracked at airports in the past. But since there is no mechanism to thoroughly check international passengers coming from other places, there is some gap on this front,” Sinha said.
 
 NCB officials are now planning to take up a campaign, along with excise officials, for the benefit of school and college students and to inform them about the dangers of drug abuse. 
 
 “We also want to make use of social media to spread this awareness against drug use,” Sinha said at the pre.
 
 Meanwhile, the excise officials denied reports that the ongoing drugs case involving Tollywood personalities might be transferred to NCB in the backdrop of Saturday’s meeting. 
 
 “There is no truth in the transfer of the case. The investigation of the case will be done only by the excise department,” officials said.
