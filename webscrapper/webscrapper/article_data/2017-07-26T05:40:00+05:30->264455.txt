Nagpur: The state government has extended ban on gutkha, kharra, flavoured tobacco, scented supari and related items citing them dangerous to health for the fifth consecutive year. Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) records show 689 cases registered against sale of these banned products in six districts of the division in the last five years.

 Anti-tobacco activists and people say the number of cases are very low and these prohibited products are being sold openly everywhere in the city and other part of the division.
 
 The FDA on Monday reimposed the ban on scented supari. While extending the ban on all products for one year, the FDA on July 17 had lifted the ban on scented supari till a study and report was completed by a one-member committee. Following strong criticism, the FDA extended ban on scented supari but for only six months.
 
 As per FDA’s data, 8,310 inspections were done in six districts of the division between July 19, 2012 and July 20, 2017 during which banned products were seized in 689 cases. An offence was registered against 299 persons of whom 424 faced prosecution. 
 
 Value of seized products amount to Rs3.89 crore. In the state, the FDA had seized products worth Rs106.98 crore in the last five years.
 
 The president of Vidarbha unit of Akhil Bhartiya Grahak Panchayat, Gajanan Pande told TOI that the government imposed ban on these harmful products but never implemented it in an effective manner. “We conducted a study and learnt about the ill-effects of tobacco-related products. We filed a case with Akhil Bhartiya Grahak Manch around 8 years ago. Banning was a good step but all types of banned products, especially kharra, can be seen being sold and consumed across Vidarbha,” he said.
 
 Pande added that the government should initiate action against FDA officials. “FDA officials take action only after complaints come to them. It never conducts search operations. Action on official negligence can bring some change,” he said.
 
 However, joint commissioner (food) SR Kekra said FDA was taking action in the division and even planning to expedite things. “Banned products worth Rs20 lakh were seized on Monday night with the help of city police,” he said.
 
 FDA Officials say that staff crunch and no ban in adjoining states of Maharashtra were the reasons behind the banned things continuing to be available. “Norms say there should be one food inspector for every 1 lakh population. Nagpur district unit comprises 12 food inspectors while the requirement is 40. Districts like Gadchiroli have only two food inspectors. One assistant commissioner has charge of two or more districts. Even joint commissioner of Nagpur division is having charge of Amravati division. Food inspectors have to be present in courts and also follow a lengthy process in pre and post action. FDA is also a lengthy list of works like issuing food license to eateries, checking quality and hygiene of food etc,” they said.
