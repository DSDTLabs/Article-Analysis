LUCKNOW: In a review meeting on Thursday, divisional commissioner   instructed   to expedite   projects as execution of none of them had begun yet.

 Even the detailed project reports of several proposals had not been completed.
 
 Some of these   are providing smart parking solutions in  , installation of sign boards and CCTV cameras at 108 places in the city and covering the entire area under solid waste management plan, whose project completion deadline has been crossed. Work on any of these is yet to begin.
