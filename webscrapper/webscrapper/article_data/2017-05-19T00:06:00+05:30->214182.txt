Indore: The Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh high court on Thursday granted a stay on the removal of the Bakra   at Gafur Khan ki Bajariya until an optional rehabilitation plan is not submitted by them.

 Justice SC Sharma granted this stay during the hearing of a petition filed by MP Bhed Bakra Vyapari Evam Dukandar Association, which challenged the IMC’s action to remove the goat and sheep market.
 
 The association, through its counsel advocate Vinay Saraf, told the court on Thursday that the Bakra marketplace was a source of income for nearly 500 families. Hence, removing the market without giving an alternate option would severely impact the lives of hundreds of people.
 
 “We had already said in the petition that we are ready to shift the market elsewhere. Our main concern was regarding the IMC’s oral order directing closure of the Bakra mandi,” Saraf added.
 
 The court took note of these arguments and directed the IMC to first acquire separate land for the market, build the structure, provide facilities for traders, start the market’s operations and only then could the market at Gafur Khan ki Bajariya be closed down.
 
 “The IMC had also submitted an affidavit before the court stating they planned to shift the market to a plot near Rau and that they had written a letter to the Waqf Board to allot land for Bakra Mandi,” Vinay Saraf added.
 
 In the petition, the traders alleged IMC had threatened them to remove the mandi, failing which their houses would be razed by the civic body. They also said the mandi had been operational there since the Holkar era.
 
 The IMC on previous hearings had told the court they had received complaints from residents of the area that certain traders had been keeping live goats and sheep in residential bungalows which made it difficult for them to live.
