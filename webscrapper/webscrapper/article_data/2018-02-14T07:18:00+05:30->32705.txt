NOIDA: The RWA federation on Tuesday said welfare associations were not obliged to arrange for compost machines and manage solid waste according to the solid waste management rules, 2016. 

 The RWA federation’s response followed a meeting with the   on January 16, when the latter had proposed that the   could manage the solid waste generated at their doorstep through compost machines and bear 25% of the cost while the   would fund the rest.
 
 The RWA stand was reiterated by the   on Tuesday, when it maintained that according to the rules, only communities and institutions that have more than 5,000sqm area and generate waste exceeding 100kg a day were required to ensure segregated waste, facilitate collection in separate streams and hand over the same to authorised pickers.
 
 “Household waste generators are only to ensure segregation in separate streams and RWAs are required to facilitate the collection,” said A N Dhawan, the secretary-general of FONRWA.
 
 Dhawan added that such roles of households and RWAs had come into play only after the Authority, which has been assigned the municipal services, “have formulated composite rules/guidelines, arranged for authorised waste pickers or authorised recyclers”. According to Dhawan, no RWA had come forward to purchase the compost machines at 25%of the total cost, as had been proposed during the meeting on January 16. Dhawan said there could be further problems regarding the compost machines, as the people residing in the neighborhood might oppose the foul smell coming out of the garbage in them.
