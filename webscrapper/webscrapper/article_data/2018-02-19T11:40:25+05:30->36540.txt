Whether you visit it during the day or at night, you’ll always see witness thousands of dhobis meticulously working amidst small stalls that reportedly date back to British era. The iconic city landmark has now got a colourful makeover though thanks to artist-muralist and social activist  .
As part of her   project, Rouble decided to team up with   and   to add splashes of vibrant colours to Dhobi Ghat, making it stand out even more than before. 
 Rouble has also been busy working on the   and   slum painting and revamping project where apart from painting the slums, they are also refurbished and given waterproof roofs. Said Rouble, “The idea is to ensure a beautiful and colourful metro and at the same time, help people who stay there waterproof their homes. Seeing the look, a lot of them volunteer to join in and help us make the area colourful. That is the least we can do for the dwellers of the world’s largest open laundry. As a Mumbaiite, it is a matter of pride for each of us that we house these dhobi ghats.”
