This Monday evening, at a multiplex in a mall in Sector 21, the audience bought the tickets, made their way inside the cinema hall, and found their seats. But instead of the opening credits on the big screen, the audience was greeted by the cast in front of the screen. It was a play being staged inside a cinema hall, in what the organisers call is a first-of-its-kind experiment.

  A Noida-based theatre group, ' ', staged their play ' ' inside a cinema hall of a Noida multiplex. The group said that the idea to hold a play inside a cinema hall sprung from the constant complaint of Noida not having decent auditoriums for theatre. Kanu Priya, the director, said, "I had been trying to look for a proper auditorium for almost two years in Noida, and in their absence, and had to stage shows in Delhi instead. But that meant that our Noida folks and the actors' families had to travel there to see. So when I couldn't find a decent auditorium, I decided to be a little creative and that’s how this idea came."

 The play was a satire on spirituality and society’s bid to proclaim their spiritual belief as the best. The play told the story of a dysfunctional family, where every member – barring the man of the house – is into some different form of attaining spiritual enlightenment, and tries to prove that their path is better than what others follow. For the audience, it was an unusual and unique experience, and many of them wished there were more such stagings, considering a scarcity of theatre shows in Noida. Anu Singh, a Sector 93 resident, said, "I’ve seen plays, but this was a unique experience. Generally, you come to the cinema hall to catch a movie, so it was a good change. There need to be more such experiments in Noida."
