NOIDA: The   administration on Saturday directed the   to conduct a 15-day campaign to check if all schoolbuses in Noida and Greater Noida follow safety norms.

 The order by district   BN Singh comes against the backdrop of the Kushinagar accident, in which 13 students were killed. “Officials will ensure these buses and vans have fitness certificates and are equipped with safety gear. Driving licences will also be checked and violators fined,” Singh said.
 
 The assistant regional transport officer has been directed to submit a day-to-day report on the number of vehicles checked. Transport department officials in Noida said they had formed teams to conduct the campaign. “We will also sensitise the bus and van drivers about safety measures,” said an official.
 
 Aradhana Shukla, principal secretary in the UP government, had written to the transport department on March 30 asking for the enforcement drive to be undertaken in their respective areas. But several school buses had given the checking sessions the miss. At least 13 students were killed on Thursday when a speeding train crashed into a school van at an unmanned rail crossing in Kushinagar.
