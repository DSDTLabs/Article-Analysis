  She adds, "NSD is like a temple for me. Unfortunately, most of my teachers have now retired, but I visit the campus just to experience the vibe of the place. Not only NSD, I love   too. I have learnt kathak from   in Mandi House. I also love chhole bhature from Nathu's. I really miss Delhiâ€™s food in Mumbai. Main kabhi kabhi Delhi ka khana pack karake bhi le jati hoon. This place has given me a lot. I have learnt kathak from Sangeet Bharati, acting from NSD and I love the food from this place. So Mandi House is like my maayka, toh wahan jaana toh banta hi hai."
