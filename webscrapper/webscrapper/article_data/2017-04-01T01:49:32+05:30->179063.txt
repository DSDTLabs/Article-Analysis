MUMBAI: As much as 75% of the 858 acres (390 hectares) of   (MbPT) land will be a green zone and earmarked for open spaces and streets, according to a draft plan prepared by the consultant.

 Last November, a consortium of HCP Design, Planning and Management, PricewaterCoopers and Unity Consultancy won the bid to prepare the master plan for the revamp of port land. Of the 1,586 acres (721 hectares) of port land, around 440 acres is for port and allied activities. 
 
 “The draft plan will be discussed with stakeholders before it can be finalized. We hope to come up with the final master plan in six months and thereafter, work can begin in phases and completed in two to three years,” said MbPT chairman Sanjay Bhatia said. 
 
 The revamp will be carried out on 858 acres (390 hectares) of land of which 220 acres (100 hectares) is in ready possession. “Only 25% of this space will be consumed by Built-up Space but the remaining will be used for streets and garden with 26 per cent of public gardens, 12 per cent for private open space and balance for streets.” he added. The consultants will adopt New York’s City grid plan in the design. “The promenade will be thrice the length of Marine Drive and will have a cafeteria. Next to the promenade, there will be a 111-acre central garden, which will be four times the size of Oval Maidan. Unlike Marine Drive, a motorway will not be planned next to the promenade,” said Bhatia. 
 
 Citizens will have access to port land through the CST-Panvel high-speed railway corridor and an underground parking facility will be planned in the area.
 
 The project will be executed on a self-financing model by carrying out commercial exploitation of land.
