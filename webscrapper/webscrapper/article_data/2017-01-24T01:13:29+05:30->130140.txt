Noida: Police and the   have come up with a plan to widen the sector road connecting   with Shahdara drain to end the gridlock on the Kalindi Kunj route that has now become a daily feature. 

 A separate lane will be created for vehicles going to Delhi from Noida within a week, officials said. “We’ve decided to lay a separate slab on the road just ahead of the curve that joins the flyover with the Shahdara drain,” said Noida   cell in-charge Sandeep Chandra. 
 
 Traffic police inspector Dharmendra Yadav said while there is no permanent solution other than widening the Shahdara bridge, a separate lane for heavy vehicles has been suggested to the Noida Authority.
 
 Since work on an underpass began on this route earlier this month, half the road has been blocked by traffic, due to which police asked heavy vehicles to take the DND flyway to go to Delhi. The underpass will connect sectors 94, 95, 125 with Master Plan III road to decongest Mahamaya flyover.
 
 The situation worsened on Monday when Delhi Police blocked all three entry points to Delhi, including Kalindi Kunj, Chilla and DND, for the Republic Day parade preparations. Commuters travelling from Noida and Greater Noida to Delhi via Mahamaya-Kalindi Kunj, struggled to reach the narrow Okhla barrage as Delhi Police put up barricades on the Noida-Delhi border. The check will be repeated on January 25 and 26.
