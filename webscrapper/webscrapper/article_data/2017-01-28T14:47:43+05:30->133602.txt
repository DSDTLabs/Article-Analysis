 "I hope we reach the level of visuals and technology that we see in Hollywood films. If that happens, I am ready to kick some zombies," she added.

 When asked which one she has seen so far, the actress said, "I actually haven't watched either, but I want to watch both. So hopefully soon I'll end up catching both."
