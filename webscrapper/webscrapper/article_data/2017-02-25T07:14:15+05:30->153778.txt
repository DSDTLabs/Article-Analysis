WARANGAL: “It is probably time that Indian software engineering graduates stop going to the  . The gruesome killings must make us think twice about sending our children abroad," said M Sanjeeva Reddy, a farmer who recently lost his son in a shooting incident in the US.

 Reddy, whose son Vamsi was shot dead in Milpitas city of California recently, said, “Our children should not go and should not be sent to the US either for pursuing their higher studies or for work."
 
 Reddy said he understood the pain of Srinivas Kuchibotla's family who lost their boy to a shooter in Kansas. “Our students should not go to the US unless they receive prior security assurances from the government. I appeal to all parents to encourage their children to stab back here. There are enough opportunities in India with sufficient income sources and those in the software sector can find employment with good salaries in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai and Delhi," he said.
 
 “These attacks show that Americans do not respect our knowledge and our work. These attacks were carried out by white men who are projected as better people in that country. Students and visa holders must think if it is worth risking their lives for the lure of making more money there," Reddy said.
 
 “Every time an incident like this occurs, we parents dread for our childrens' safety and immediately make efforts to contact them. I know of people who have even fainted on hearing of such incidents in cities where their children live. All this stress is not worth it," Reddy said.
