LUDHIANA: In a breather for thousands of industrial units running in mix land use (MLU) areas, which were facing the problem of not getting consent to function after 2018, the   Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has decided to extend the deadline by five years to 2023. This was announced by PPCB chairman   during an interaction with industrialists on Saturday. Pannu also informed that several other demands of industrialists were being considered by the board, and decision on these would be taken soon.

 Speaking to mediapersons, Pannu said: “Industry has a very big role to play as far as controlling pollution in Punjab, and especially Ludhiana, is concerned. We are ready to give any help to the business fraternity, but at the same time, we expect compliance of rules and regulations by all stakeholders. As part of our industry-friendly measures, we have decided to give consent to factories in MLU areas until 2023, and we are going to bring the voluntary disclosure scheme once again for industries. PPCB is working very aggressively on the CNG gas station project, and in the first phase, it will be started in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, and Phagwara. A complete ban on registration of diesel three-wheelers will be brought into effect soon, and we will do whatever it takes to battle pollution.”
 
 Meanwhile, city businessmen gathered at the interaction — organized by   and Commercial Undertakings ( ) — appreciated the steps taken by PPCB to control pollution, including removal of sewerage waste, and ban on pressure horns.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, CICU president   said: “We are thankful to PPCB chairman for extending the deadline to give consent to factories in MLU areas to 2023. In addition to this, the board should also set up a committee to search for new technology and procedures towards pollution-free manufacturing. PPCB should also give consent to constructions of multi-storied buildings for industrial units.”
 
 CICU general secretary Pankaj Sharma demanded that at least 50 acres of land should be earmarked for red category industries in the upcoming Focal Point at Dhanansu. He also said the authority of parks and green stretches situated in focal points should be given to industrialists for maintenance and better upkeep.
 
 The programme was attended by more than 150 prominent industrialists, including SC Ralhan, Rajnish Ahuja, SS Passi, Inderjit Singh Navyug, Jaswinder Thukral, Rajinder Singh Sarhali, Manmohan Singh Ubhi, Inder Singh Nagpal, and  .
