Visakhapatnam: CPI   of Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee (AOBSZC) said that special category status (SCS) for Andhra Pradesh would not be granted through mere debating in the Parliament, but through united agitations by the people of the state.

 The AOBSZC spokesperson Jagabandhu alleged that chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu has been covering up his failures by citing excuses such as lack of funds allotment from the central government.
 
 The banned outfit, alleged that both the Bharatiya Janata Party and Telugu Desam Party have indulged in opportunist politics and alliance. They have cheated the public. He gave a call to the public to raise their voices against both the parties. He accused the two parties of not implementing a single condition in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 in their four-year rule.
 
 Jagabandhu alleged that Naidu has made false claims of making Andhra Pardesh the most developed state in the country and yet, ‘there has been no development in the past four years, but only destruction’. He said “Naidu has been following the ‘World Bank-style development’ and alleged that the dispensation killed three   that were captured on his swearing-in ceremony day to stifle the voices against him.”
 
 He further said that development of state should not just include the construction of a new capital city and the Polavaram project, but the development of backwards areas like Rayalaseema and nsorth Andhra. “People should demand for proper development,” he advised.
