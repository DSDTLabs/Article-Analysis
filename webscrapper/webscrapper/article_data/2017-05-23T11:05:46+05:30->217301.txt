VISAKHAPATNAM: Usually busy road junctions make people frown as they wait at traffic signals under the hot sun. But it was an exception at two such junctions – the   on the national highway and Birla Junction near NAD — on Monday morning. At these two junctions, the waiting commuters wore smiles on their face as they rode away with gifts.

 Hundreds of motorists, who were spotted with TOI newspaper and were abiding by traffic rules, were recipients of rewards from traffic cops as part of ‘Win with the Times’ campaign.
 
 D Sowjanya, a private employee, said, “I was driving my two-wheeler and, as usual, wearing a helmet. So being rewarded for following traffic rules was quite unexpected. But I am happy to get the gift. I also feel it is a very good campaign by TOI to raise traffic awareness among the public.”
 
 TV Naidu, who was waiting at the junction in his car, also found the campaign quite enlightening. “Given the large number of road accidents that take place in cities, such type of campaigns are the need of the hour to make people aware of traffic norms and encourage them to follow it. I congratulate TOI for taking this initiative,” he said.
 
 Organised by The  , the campaign is supported by the city traffic police and Vizag RTA department and would be held at various junctions in the city till May 26 from Monday to Friday between 8.30 am and 10 am. On Tuesday, ‘Win with the Times’ campaign will be held at   and TC Palem Junction.
