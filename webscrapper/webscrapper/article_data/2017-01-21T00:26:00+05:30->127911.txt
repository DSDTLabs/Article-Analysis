Bhopal: Former finance minister Raghavji Bhai (83) is distraught that former Congress leader and three times chief minister   has joined the BJP. Raghavji questioned the principles of the BJP which expelled him after an allegation of unnatural sex in 2013, but accepted ND Tiwari who had to step-down from the post of Andhra Pradesh governor after a sex CD scandal. Tiwari also fought a legal battle denying paternity to his son Rohit Shekhar but finally had to concede defeat.

 “I find it hard to believe that ND Tiwari is acceptable to the BJP when the accusations against him have been proved while I was expelled by the same party when nothing could be proved,” Raghavji Bhai told reporters on Thursday. “My expulsion was against the tenets of the party constitution and I have been saying this from the first day.”
 
 In July 2013, Raghavji Bhai’s male domestic help accused him of sexual exploitation and a CD surfaced to support the allegation. Four months before the assembly elections, Raghavji had to resign from the ministerial post and was even arrested and sent to judicial custody. His political career came to an end with the sex CD and   allegation.
 
 But on Thursday, Raghavji resurfaced and asked, “What does the party want to prove by accepting ND Tiwari? I have nothing against the BJP giving a ticket to his son Rohit Shekhar but it beats my logic why the party should have accepted the father into the fold.”
