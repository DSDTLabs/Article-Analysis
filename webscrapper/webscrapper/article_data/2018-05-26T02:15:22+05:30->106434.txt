NAVI MUMBAI: Unattended   and slush removed from the drainage lines and nullahs during the ongoing pre-monsoon cleaning work have been lying on footpaths and roads in   nodes like Kharghar, Kamothe, Kalamboli, Taloja and Karanjade of   area for many days, alleged residents. Foul odour along with little space to walk has added to their woes. In most part of the city the drainage covers on the footpath are still open even after the sludge was extracted.

 “Cidco contractors are yet to lift the waste that is being dumped along the footpaths. If it’s not removed it will flow back to the drain and road during he first shower of the season and cause flooding,” said Kharghar resident   N. 
 
 The contractors have beenhired by Cidco to maintain the drains during the monsoon to ensure that no clogging takes place. 
 
  Cidco administrator of New Panvel and Kamothe, P S Phulari said, “We will issue strict warning to the contractors to dispose off the sludge on the next day of its removal from drains.” 
 
 In NMMC area the excavated sludge, once dried, is carried away to the dumping yard within 48 hours which is not the case in Cidco nodes, said residents. Sitaram Rokade, Cidco administrator for   said, “We will look into the matter.”
