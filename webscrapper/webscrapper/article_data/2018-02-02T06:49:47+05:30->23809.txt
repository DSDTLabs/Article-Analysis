NEW DELHI: The   will explore various options and discuss the minimum support price (MSP) plan with states before devising the scheme,   minister   said on Thursday.

 Addressing a news conference after presenting his fifth Budget  ,   defended the move to impose long-term capital gains tax and said resources will be made available to fund the mega programmes. He said there were several factors in the Budget which benefit people across the spectrum. “There are some factors which benefit all. Infrastructure benefits everyone,” Jaitley said.
 
 Finance secretary   said there were two schemes before the government on MSP and it will have to choose one scheme or states can be given both the alternatives.
 
 “There is need for deep discussion on this with states. Niti Aayog will discuss the issue,” Adhia said, referring to MP’s Bhabantar scheme, in which the price difference is paid to farmers. “The other option is providing the infrastructure for actual procurement in states. The Centre and states can share the cost for the project,” he said.
 
 The FM said high crude price could have an impact if it breaches the range with which the government is comfortable. “I am personally not willing to share my view on which way the prices will go. Nobody predicted the fall when it took place and nobody predicted the rise when it is taking place. I think there is a certain range which keeps us comfortable and if it goes beyond, obviously it has its own consequences. We are almost on the verge of that range at the moment,” he said.
 
 Adhia said the excise duty on petrol and diesel was being reduced and this would be converted into a cess and it would not impact final prices. He said the earlier road cess was being subsumed under the road and infrastructure cess to fund roads, railways and urban infrastructure.
