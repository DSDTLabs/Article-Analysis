Panaji: Six months after the fire at the KTC bus stand building in Panaji engulfed the Panaji RTO office and the Presidential supermarket, the other tenants in the building have been instructed to ensure that their shops have fire prevention equipment on the premises or they stand to lose their trade licences. With the due date for registration having expired on March 31, tenants of the KTC bus stand building had approached the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) for the annual renewal.  The officers concerned informed them that they must obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the directorate of fire and emergency services first as this is a mandatory certificate for renewal of trade licenses. Shopkeepers are now in the process of fixing fire extinguishers in their shops to be eligible for ‘fire safe’ certification. “This new provision has been added this year, probably due to last year’s fire breakout,” said Kadamba Tenants Association, chairperson, Antonio Inacio.  “Fire inspectors will come and inspect the premises and then issue an NOC which we will then submit to the CCP to renew our licence for another 12 months,” he said. “Every shop requires to have fire safety equipment. The portable extinguisher is user-friendly and can be used by anyone. If shopkeepers are interested, we will give them a demo on fire safety. But before reaching us, they should know how to extinguish a fire,” said Ravi Naik, Panaji station fire officer.  Depending of their weight, the cost of the cylinders being installed varies from Rs 1,200 to Rs 4,000 plus GST. Commenting that the electrical wiring in the building had been changed post the fire incident, a KTC official said,  “There is no threat of short circuit inside the building anymore. KTC are planning to have fire equipment of our own as well which will be installed within the building premises.”
