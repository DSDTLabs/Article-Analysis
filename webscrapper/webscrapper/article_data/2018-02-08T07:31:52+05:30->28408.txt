KOLKATA: Bengal government is planning to set up   machines in medical college hospitals, which are expected to improve the skills of surgeons and help patients undergo minimally invasive operations. A test run was conducted during a workshop on robotic surgery at NRS Medical College and Hospital (NRSMCH) on Wednesday.

 The effort is described as feasibility study on use of robotic surgery in the government medical colleges, taking into account the huge cost involved, said Debasis Bhattacharyya, state medical education director. Bhattacharyya himself sat behind the console to check the equipment’s functioning.
 
 “We need to find out the viability of robotic surgery in a government set up. I’ve asked for a report on how it will benefit patients. At present, it is being operated in   of Oncology, Bengaluru. We have to think about the cost and where it can be installed. We are assessing the details before seeking approval of the finance department,” Bhattacharyya said.
 
  
 
 Trinamool MLA Nirmal Maji, who heads the standing committee on health in Assembly, said the faculty members of   and Hospital (CMCH) and NRS from departments like general surgery, neruo surgery, uro surgery, plastic surgery, gynaecology, ENT and gastrointestinal surgery learnt how to use machine. Maji proposed installing it at CMCH but SSKM and NRS hospitals also want it. The latest machine costs around Rs 36 crore. Maji hopes the CM will give nod for installation as many top ranking government hospitals in other states have it.
 
 Tapan Mondal, head of Urology at NRS, said in three days they taught around 250 surgeons to use the machine. Similarly, CMCH trained over 200 surgeons said the hospital’s head of Urology  . A health official said they are planning to buy one such machine initially and train more surgeons.
