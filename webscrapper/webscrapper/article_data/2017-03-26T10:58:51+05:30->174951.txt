MUMBAI: A fortnight after the   election results, when   Uddhav Thackeray called up Prime Minister Narendra Modi to congratulate him for the party's victory, Modi invited Thackeray to New Delhi for the NDA's conclave over dinner. The dinner meeting is scheduled for next week, probably on March 29, it is learnt.

 “During talks with Thackeray, Modiji will try to resolve the deadlock in the ruling BJP-Sena alliance in Maharashtra,“ a senior state BJP functionary said on Saturday. 
 
 “Much depends on how Thackeray will respond to Modiji's initiative," he added. “Much also depends on whether Thackeray chooses to be one among the many invitees at the   conclave in New Delhi," said a Sena functionary. “Actually, the Sena is represented by one of the party's senior MPs — Sanjay Raut, Union minister Anant Gite or Anil Desai at the NDA meets. Uddhavji normally stays away from such jamborees. However, he may visit New Delhi as the dinner invite has come straight from the Prime Minister,“ he added.
 
 A Sena leader hinted that the meeting called by Modi could be to obtain consent over the Presidential poll in July.
 
  
  
 
 Meanwhile, BJP veteran Nitin Gadkari has asked the Sena to mend its ways or map out its own path. “They are free to break ties with BJP if they choose to,“ the Union minister for surface transport told a news channel on Saturday , in a clear indication that resolving the ongoing dispute in the 
  is an uphill task.
