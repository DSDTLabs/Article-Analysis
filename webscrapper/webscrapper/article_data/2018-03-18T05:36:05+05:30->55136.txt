MUMBAI: Motorists’ desire to get a new vehicle on   drove up   by 8% and two-wheelers by 18% last week, sources in the   (RTO) say. 

 Purchase of new vehicles usually peaks during Gudi Padwa, Akshaya Tritiya, Dussehra and Diwali, which are considered auspicious days. 
 
  
 On an average, 125 cars and 400 two-wheelers are registered in Mumbai every day. However, in the last one week, a total of 950 cars (around 135 daily) and 3,300 two-wheelers (around 471 daily) were registered. The four city RTOs were open for an extra hour over the past few days to ensure all new registrations were completed and inspections done before assistant RTOs issued the new vehicle numbers. A regional transport officer said: “The new registration numbers are issued within 24 hours while inspections are completed in just a couple of days. So, we expedited the process of getting a new car or bike once citizens made bookings.”
 
 Some also applied for special number plates, which come at a premium. 
 
 While the registration formalities were completed in a record time, the smartcard RC (registration certificates) will be issued in the next three days. "But the dealers can hand over the vehicles with the new number plates and the buyers can drive it right from Day One," an official added.
