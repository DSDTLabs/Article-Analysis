MUMBAI: Drawing attention to the rampant illegal sale of abortion kits through  , the   and Druggists’ Association (MSCDA) has written to the   (FDA) demanding an immediate crackdown on such virtual entities.

 Members from the MSCDA said one of their members, Vijay Changediya, from Pune, recently managed to procure a medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) kit from a website for Rs 1,144. The kit arrived bearing a Delhi address and at no point was Changediya asked to furnish a prescription or even mention a doctor’s reference.
 
 The kit consists of one tablet of Mifepristone to be consumed orally and four tablets of Misoprostol to be administered vaginally. As per the MTP Act, only a registered medical practitioner can administer the medicines. Doctors say unsupervised use of these medicines can lead to several complications, including infection, bleeding and even pose threat to life.
 
 The websites operate from across the country though they are mainly concentrated in the northern states.
 
 “We have alerted FDA officials with specific details on websites that operate clandestinely under fictitious names and addresses. The sellers hide behind the anonymity that the Internet allows,” said Jagannath Shinde, president, MSCDA.
 
 A senior FDA official told TOI several of these websites were shut down in the last few years. FDA commissioner Pallavi Darade couldn’t be reached for a comment.
 
 Shinde said the centre has been deliberating on rules to regulate the online sale of medicines, but there was nothing concrete yet.TNN
