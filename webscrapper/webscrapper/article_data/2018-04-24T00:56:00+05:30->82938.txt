Madurai: A group of disabled people took out a rally from Teppakulam to Madurai collector office on three-wheelers pressing for fulfillment of various demands on Monday. They submitted a petition to Madurai district administration in the public grievance redressal meeting at the collector office.

 According to them, they don't use bus as they can't board them and hence are forced to use three-wheelers. But they find the fuel prices escalating day-by-day and are unable to manage the cost. They sought petrol at subsidised cost.
 
 In their petition, they appealed that if both of the partners were disabled, one of them should at least get a government job for supporting the family and their children should be provided with reservation in education and jobs. They also pleaded that they should be provided special consideration when it comes to free land title to disabled people.
 
 Explaining their plight, the group pointed out that their three-wheelers are not allowed in the vicinity of Meenakshi temple. Besides this, they appealed state government to establish homes for disabled people as some of the women can't get married and sometimes suffer abuse at the hands of their close relatives.
 
 P Karupiah, district secretary of Crawling Differently Abled Association explained the reason behind their rally at Teppakulam. A group of social activists flagged off the rally.
