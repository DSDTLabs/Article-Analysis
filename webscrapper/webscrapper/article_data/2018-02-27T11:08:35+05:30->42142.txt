MUMBAI:   has revealed additional unauthorised transactions related to the scam by 
  and his uncle and business partner,  , increasing the estimated size of the fraud by $204 million (Rs 1,322 crore). This increase means that the total fraud now amounts to nearly $2 billion (Rs 12,622 crore) as against the original estimated $1,772 million (over Rs 11,300 crore).

 The value of the additional unauthorised transactions is almost equal to PNB’s entire net income of Rs 1,320 crore for fiscal year 2017. The disclosure was made to stock exchanges late on Monday night.
 
 The fresh letters of undertaking (LoUs) were understood to have been discovered after being reported by overseas bank branches, which checked their portfolio in light of the recent fraud.
 
 Total exposure of banking sector over ?20,000 crore
 
 We have to inform that the quantum of reported unauthorised transactions can increase by $204 million,” 
  said in a filing to stock exchanges on Monday night. In a separate filing, PNB denied media reports that it has been asked to pay for fraud liabilities by the gover nment.
 
 The unauthorised transactions refer to Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) fraudulently issued by the bank’s midcorporate branch at   in Mumbai in favour of
 
 the   group and Gitanjali group companies. On February 14, the bank had first reported the unauthorised LoUs (which are in the nature of a bank guarantee). Against these guarantees, overseas branches of Indian banks had extended loans to suppliers (who were also associates of the Nirav Modi/Gitanjali group).
 
 The fraud was discovered after the borrowers failed to pay and the overseas branches sought to invoke the guarantees with PNB.
 
 In addition to the LoUs, PNB is understood to have a line of credit of close to Rs 1,000 crore to the Mehul Choksi/Nirav Modi groups. The total exposure of the banking sector is expected to be well in excess of Rs 20,000 crore.
