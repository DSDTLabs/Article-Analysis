Surat: Officials of the Surat district collectorate demolished shrimp farms on 70 hectares of government land at Rajagiri village in Olpad taluka on Sunday. No one has come forward to own these farms. 

 Officials under the supervision of Olpad sub-divisional magistrate went and destroyed them as well as the embankments made for the shrimp farms. The encroachers won’t be able to deposit water there now for shrimp farming. B R Ahir, sub-divisional magistrate at Olpad, said, “It was an impossible task to remove the water. We did the next best thing by breaking the embankments and allowed the collected water to flow towards the sea.” He said notices were issued in the past one month asking whosoever had encroached upon the government land to vacate it. 
 
 Surat district collector Dhaval Patel said, “We will carry out demolitions on a regular basis. We request people not to cultivate crops or do shrimp farming on government land which is illegal. We don’t want people to suffer any losses.”
