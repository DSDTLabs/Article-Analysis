NEW DELHI: Three days after   recovered documents pertaining to assets worth crores belonging to Delhi minister  , the agency on Tuesday seized four hard disks and three laptops allegedly linked to the AAP leader from the president of  , Arun Gupta. 

 The CBI also “categorically denied” AAP’s claim that the documents it claims to have seized were already with it since last year. 
 
 About the property documents recovered on Saturday, CBI officials said, “None of the three documents — two original property documents and a photo copy of power of attorney in question which were recovered during searches at Rishiraj’s residence were provided to it to at any stage or seized by the agency during searches at Jain's residence last year”. 
 
  Delhi government spokesperson   challenged the CBI to put out the documents in the public domain. “CBI’s credibility is at an all time low. It is known for harrassing political rivals. Like we put out documents on Satyendar Jain in the public domain why can’t CBI also put out the documents if they are claiming to have got new documents. What we put out was based on the CBI’s own seizure memo,” Sharma said.
 
 Sources told   on Tuesday that during questioning of   registrar   who was arrested on Saturday night, they got information about the laptops and hard disks lying with Gupta.
 
 The agency searched the premises of Gupta from where the recoveries were made. These electronic gadgets have been sent for forensic analysis, sources added. In response to CBI’s charges, Sharma said that the allegations have no meaning till one knew what is it that CBI has found. “Just seizing hard disks and laptops has no meaning as such,” a senior functionary said. Details of an ICICI bank account linked to Jain were also recovered on Tuesday, said sources.
