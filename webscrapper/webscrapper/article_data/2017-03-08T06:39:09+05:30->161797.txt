AHMEDABAD:  , who tried to commit suicide on Tuesday, said he was fed up with the inaction of the   (AMC). He said the civic body had ignored numerous complaints of hazardous industrial effluent being illegally directed in drainage, and about encroachments in   and Thakkarbapanagar. 

 Kathiria claimed he had been lodging complaints with the deputy municipal commissioner’s offices in south and east zone for many months now. He had informed them about the illegal constructions and also polluted water being discharged into the Kharicut canal. 
 
 He said that none among the engineering staff of AMC had taken note, despite his of submitting CDs of video clips and photographs as evidence at the civic body’s main office as well as the zonal office. 
 
 “As a citizen I am tired of complaining repeatedly to the authorities,” Kathiria said. “How is it that AMC officers turn a deaf ear to a citizen who is in fact helping them in their duty? How can they be so apathetic? I had even tried to become a member of the opposition parties, thinking political clout may work. But that too has not worked.”
