 has been making waves at the box office windows and also breaking records just as much. Starring Mega Star Chiranjeevi and Kajal Aggarwal, this movie was produced by Ram Charan and Surekha – all in the family. The film has broken the records of here as well as overseas. It started off with over 35 crores on Day One including US premiers and here at home. US Box office collected over 8 crores on the first day itself. Day two collected 18 crores, and 1.8 crores overseas, while Day three got 16 crores. Fourth Day that is today is collecting approximately 10 crores totalling up to 78 crores already.

  That breaks a lot of non-Baahubali records in Tollywood. The film is going steady in the B and C centres. Despite the critics going harsh on the telugu remake of Vijay’s Katthi, the masses seem to love it considering the collections.
