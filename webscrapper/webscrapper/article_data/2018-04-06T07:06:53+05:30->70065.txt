ENGALURU:   in   seems to have increased over the past few days, and threatening to fly off on to neighbouring  .

 “I was near the lake for a few hours on Wednesday and it was frothing badly. This could be because of the recent rain as well as pipeline construction work in Kolar, which is causing a blockage and forcing the foam to stay in one place. However, neither of the underlying causes of the foam — untreated sewage and phosphorus content in detergents — has been tackled,” said Pravir Bagrodia of Whitefield Rising, a citizens’ group. 
 
 BDA engineer Veersingh Nayak said the frothing could have increased due to construction work near the waste weir. “The width of the weir has been reduced as work is on, so the froth is piling up,” he said.
 
 Varthur lake is downstream of Bellandur lake, which has made global headlines for its frequent frothing.
