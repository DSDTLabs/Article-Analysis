MUMBAI: The LTT-Madgaon double-decker train may be   due to poor demand as the railways has stopped taking   from February 21. “We have stopped taking bookings for this train as the demand is too low,” said a senior CR official, adding that a final decision is yet to be taken. 

 The train departs from LTT on Sundays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 5.30am and reaches Madgaon at 5.30pm. On its return journey, it leaves Madgaon at 6am and arrives in LTT at 5.10pm. One of the major reason for the train not running successfully because of the inconvenient timings from LTT. Also, its timing clashes with the Karmali Tejas Express, which departs from CSMT at 5am, and halts at Dadar too.
