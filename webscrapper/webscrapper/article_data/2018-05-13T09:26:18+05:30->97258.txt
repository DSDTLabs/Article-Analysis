CHANDIGARH: Whether you have a gift ready for your mother or not,   (PU) certainly has one. It is going to include mother’s name in PhD degrees from the 2018-19 session. The university already includes the mother’s name in the degrees given to MA students and BSc (hons) students.

 Under the existing practice, PhD degrees offered to students only have father’s name and the state or UT to which the research scholar belongs. In the region,  , Patiala, already includes the name of mothers on the degrees.
 
 “The university will now introduce the provision of having mother’s name in PhD degrees. After the discussion in the syndicate, I had enquired and it turned out that PU already has the provision to include mother’s name in BA and MA degrees. So, why not for PhD degree holders,” said Parvinder Singh, controller of examinations, PU. However, this does not mean that father’s name would be removed.
 
 The matter was raised by member Prof I S Sidhu in the zero hour of the syndicate meeting held in March. “Many students during this year’s convocation came to me and said they want to have their mother’s name in the PhD degrees. We are living in the 21st century and there are students raised by single mothers and then there are children whose parents are separated. For such students, having mother’s name on their degrees is significant. I think PhD degrees of a prestigious varsity like PU should have the mother’s name of the scholars,” said Sidhu.
 
 It was in June 2014 that the   ( ) had sent a communication to the vicechancellors of all the universities stating that mother’s name should be included in all degrees and certificates.
