Kolkata: The West Bengal government is coming up with marketing and support initiatives to help global customers’ confidence return to Darjeeling   brands. 

 Last year, due to Gorkha Janmukti Morcha’s shutdown demanding statehood, which went on for over 100 days, tea production in the Hills came to a halt. 
 
 Although the state government is yet to decide on the exact nature of branding support, West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation MD Vandana Yadav said the state government intends to create around 30 brands of Darjeeling tea, which will become the flag-bearers of the industry. 
 
 She was speaking on the sidelines of an event organised here by CII. 
 
 The state government will also help the industry in better price and market discovery. Key markets for Darjeeling tea include Germany, Japan, US and UK. 
 
 It is learnt that the state government might identify selected estates which produce quality tea with a good global order book.
