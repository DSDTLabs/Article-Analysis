AHMEDABAD: In the past five months, on SG Road, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation freed close to  ,207 square feet area within commercial complexes to parking. This space, which largely lay encroached in the basement of the buildings was either underutilised, converted to shops using prefab building materials, used as godowns for storage and even for running tuition classes or as vehicle garages.

 In 30-odd complexes of the 236 large complexes on SG Road, the   demolished encroachments and in some cases the owners themselves pulled down such structures in the last two months. ‘There are some minor encroachment issues in over 70-odd complexes that will be cleared soon,” says a senior estate officer in the   zone.
 
 The official also informed that on the stretch between   to Pakwan crossroads, the AMC had identified parking space for 940 two-wheelers and 228 cars along the service lane just opposite the Karnavati and   side of SG Road.
 
 The New West zone of the AMC is also one of the first to begin uploading all parking plans for all multi-storied buildings within its jurisdiction on the AMC website. 
 
 To eliminate errors, the AMC has even uploaded the photographs of buildings when the Building Use (BU) permission was issued to the builder. The website has a list of names of buildings, their addresses, area approved for two and four-wheeler parking as well as area for visitors parking. 
 
 Also seven large AMC plots that were lying vacant measuring up to 28,762 square metres near Amiraj Farm, behind Kargil petrol pump, Sarkhej Bridge, Sindhu Bhavan Road, Prahladnagar Garden, Silver Star crossroads and near   party plot have been converted to public parking areas to de-congest main arterial roads. This is by far the largest parking provisioning in the New West zone.
