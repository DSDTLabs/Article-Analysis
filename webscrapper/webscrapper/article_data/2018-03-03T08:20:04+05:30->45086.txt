GUWAHATI: The All Assam Homoeopathic Medical College Students' Union filed an FIR on Friday against a few   personnel for having allegedly lathicharged and manhandled them while they were staging a demonstration at Last Gate in the city on Wednesday. The union has also threatened to forcibly close down three   and hospitals in the state for an indefinite period from March 3. 
 
 Over 250 homoeopathic doctors, junior doctors and students from the three homoeopathic colleges and hospitals of the state had been participating in the demonstration at Last Gate from February 26 to 28 to highlight their grievances and long standing demands when police allegedly lathicharged to disperse them. President of the union, Eyasin Ikram   sustained a head injury while female doctors and students alleged of being manhandled and lathicharged by male policemen during the incident.
 
 Farazi said, "We were demonstrating in a peaceful manner at Last Gate to highlight the pathetic condition of the homoeopathic colleges and hospitals in the state. Many of doctors passing out from these hospitals are still unemployed. But a few policemen started lathicharging on us illegally. A policeman dragged me by my hand while another hit me on the head with his stick. I have suffered from a skull bone fracture and had to be admitted in the hospital. Moreover, male policemen also beat up and manhandled our female doctors and students who had participated in the demonstration." 
 
 "We have filed an FIR at the   today against these policemen. We strongly condemn their inhuman action. We want strict action to be taken against the guilty. Since our long standing demands have not been met by the government, we will close down the three homoeopathic colleges and hospitals in the state for an indefinite period from March 3," Farazi, who has been released from the hospital now, added.
