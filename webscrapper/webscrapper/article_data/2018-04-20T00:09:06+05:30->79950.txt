He was a transit passenger who had arrived from Riyadh on Jet Airways flight 9W 523 aroound 7am and was undergoing security check to board Jet Konnect flight S2-421 for Kozhikode, which was to depart at 8.40am. “During security screening, CISF assistant sub-inspector Prashant Kumar noticed some doubtful padding on the waist of a passenger,” said a CISF spokesperson. He was asked to open the waist belt, which was found to be made of cloth. CISF personnel found a gelatinous substance—a yellow powder mixed into a  . The mixture was wrapped in plastic sheet that went inside the belt, said the CISF official. “Kumar informed CISF and   officials, who declared that the yellow material was   weighing about 960gm and worth Rs 27 lakh.
