MUMBAI: In a serious incident, a locomotive jumped the red signal in between   and  , thus disrupting services on the fast corridor for one hour on Central Railway.

 Source said the authorities had set a red signal on CSMT-bound fast track. A few metres ahead there is point and crossing that was set in the direction of Thanebound track.
 
 Source further said the engine jumped the signal and was about to enter the down direction when the loco pilot realized something was amiss and applied the brakes.
 
 In railway terminology, such incidents are called Signal Passing at Danger (SPAD) in which motorman or loco pilot forgets to halt train despite red signal.
 
 An official said, "The incident happened at 1.05 pm. Traffic on CSMT direction was restored at 1.50 pm and on Thane-bound track at 2.20 pm.”
 
 Commuters who were stuck in trains alighted on the track and walked to the nearest station to catch slow trains.
 
 Additonal railway manager   said, “This is a case of a diesel loco passing a red signal. No passenger carrying suburban or mail express train was involved. Around 29 suburban trains have lost punctuality due to this. We are ensuring that cancellation of trains is kept to bare minimum. We are probing the incident further."
 
 CR source said that it is fortunate that the train did not enter the down track. Imagine the consequence if a train from down track was moving ahead if this engine had veered further more.
