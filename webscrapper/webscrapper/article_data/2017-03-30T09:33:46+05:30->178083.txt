VIZAG:   and   had the last laugh in the 2016-2017 domestic season. A swashbuckling hundred from Karthik 126 (91 balls, 14x4s, 3x6s) helped Tamil Nadu clinch the   beating   by 42 runs in the final at the Dr YSR ACA-VDCA Stadium here on Wednesday. 

 The victory meant that Tamil Nadu are now the only state team to have laid their hands on all the five major trophies - Ranji, Irani Cup, Vijay Hazare, Deodhar and Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 - in Indian cricket. It was once again Karthik who came up with the knockout punch. 
 
 Karthik, registering his third List A hundred of the season, walked in with his team struggling at 393 in the 11th over. Medium-pacer   (539) extracted movement and bounce to rattle the TN top-order. However, the 31-year-old flicked his very first ball to the fence, making his intentions clear. What followed was a sensational counter-attack as Karthik and N Jagadeesan (55) -who scored his third consecutive List A fifty -added 136 for the fourth wicket in 20 overs.
 
 This is the second time Karthik had scored a century in a high-pressure final. “Maybe, I'm just repeating the same things that I have been doing throughout,” Karthik said when asked as to what has inspired him over the past two months. 
 
 Karthik was at his destructive best against both pacers and spinners. He took on pacers CV Milind (1/71) and Ashok Dinda (1/54), carting them for two audacious sixes. He unfurled a range of sweeps and slogs that deflated left-arm spinners Axar Patel (162) and Akshay Karnewar (0/44). Karthik said his goal is to be part of all formats at the international level as a “proper batsman.”
 
  “I have worked a lot on the shot selection; have tried to give myself the best chance. My aim is to make it to all formats as a proper batsman,” Karthik told TOI.
