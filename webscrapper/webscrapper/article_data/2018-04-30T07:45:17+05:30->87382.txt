PATNA: Traffic rule violations like jumping the red light, failing to stop at the zebra crossing and riding without helmets can cause you trouble. The state transport department is set to launch an automatic challan system at 15 busy junctions of the city, including Hartali Mor, Boring Road and   crossing this week.

 “Under this system, traffic violators will be identified through   cameras which will be connected to the traffic control room. A team of eight constables, one sub-inspector and four operators along with some technical staff will be deployed to detect the violations and generate immediate e-challans against them,” transport secretary   told this reporter on Sunday and added the whole idea was to create a sense of fear in the minds of traffic offenders.
 
 Deliberating on the working of the   system, Agarwal said, “If somebody violates traffic norms, the CCTV cameras will capture his picture immediately. Through the registration number of his vehicle, an e-challan will be generated and an SMS sent on the registered cellphone number. The person concerned will receive all the relevant details of the offence in the SMS along with a link where the fine will be paid online.”
 
 In case, the violator fails to pay the penalty, traffic police will trace him and take strict action against him. “Based on the database monitored and saved, if the person repeats the offence, the penalty will be doubled. If he commits the same mistake the third time, the fine will be tripled,” Agarwal said, adding the driving licence would be suspended and a heavier penalty charged after three times.
 
 Later, at least 10 hand-held devices will be given to the traffic personnel for generating on-the-spot e-challans. “If the experiment succeeds in Patna, 300 more such devices will be made available across the state,” Agarwal said.
