 The team members focussed on slums in Dhu lagarh's Dayonghata and Banstala areas. 
 
 Later, NCW member Sushma Sahu said: “We are surprised by police inaction against the attackers on the December 13 night last year when goons went from house to house and set each on fire. The state is trying to sweep under the carpet crimes committed against these victims by paying local residents Rs 35,000 each.“ Mamata Banerjee had denied any incident of rioting at Dhulagarh.
