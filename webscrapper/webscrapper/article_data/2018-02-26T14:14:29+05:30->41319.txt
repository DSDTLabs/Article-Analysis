VADODARA: A resident of Tandalja and his mother were booked for abetment of suicide at JP Road police station after his wife hanged herself on Friday evening at her home allegedly due domestic violence

 The deceased Tabassum’s father   told the police in his complaint that her husband   and mother-in-law Hasina Ghanchi had started harassing her three months after their marriage in 2015. Due to continuous harassment, the woman often used to return to her parents’ house but every time her parents convinced her and she would go back.
 
 However, when the harassment increased, Sheikh had given an application to register an FIR against Ghanchi. Thereafter there was settlement between the families and the application was withdrawn. 
 
 On Friday evening, the couple had heated argument over food and Ghanchi even bit her in the fit of rage.   then locked herself in the room on the first floor and hanged herself to a hook.
 
 After Tabassum’s post-mortem was conducted at SSG Hospital, Sheikh gave his complaint on the basis of which police booked mother-son duo for abetment of suicide, assault and subjecting her to cruelty.
