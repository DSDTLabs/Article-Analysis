MUMBAI:   director Ravi Bhandari moved the Bombay high court on Thursday with aquashing plea to challenge his arrest for culpable homicide not amounting to murder in connection with the December 29 fire.

 His plea is that the graver non-bailable offence of culpable homicide is not attracted in the FIR registered against him and an offence of negligence is bailable and hence he ought to have been released on bail and his custody is unwarranted. He even pointed to how in the   Gas tragedy the   had quashed the culpable homicide charge.
 
 A bench of Justices   and BP Colabawalla posted the matter for hearing after two weeks and said in the meantime his bail plea before a sessions court could be heard without a hitch. The bench said his plea may involve larger questions and the court may even consider seeking the opinion of the advocate general. Meanwhile, two ma- nagers of 1Above have moved bail applications.
