NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Wednesday   the police   of Vinay Bansal, son of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s late brother-in-law.   was arrested in connection with an alleged scam in the Public Works Department.

 
 He has, however, contested the allegation of Kejriwal influencing the   officials to award tenders to him saying the tender bid opened on January 19, 2015 when President’s rule was imposed in Delhi and the Delhi government came into existence on February 14, 2015.
 
 Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Khanagwal sent Bansal to custody after the counsel for Delhi Police’s Anti-Corruption Branch said he was required for custodial interrogation.
 
 Bansal, through his lawyer Mohd Irshad, earlier argued that he had nothing to do with the PWD work as it was his later father Surender Bansal who was the proprietor and he was made a partner and played no instrumental role in the working of the firm. ACB had registered FIRs in the   against Surender Bansal and Renu Constructions, owned by him.
