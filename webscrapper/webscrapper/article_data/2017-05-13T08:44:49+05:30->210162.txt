HYDERABAD: Three days after the torrential rains, the uprooted trees and broken branches have come to haunt both residents and civic authorities. While Hyderabadis rue how hundreds of fallen trees are only being dumped on the footpaths, instead of being cleared out of the thoroughfares, staffers of the   (GHMC's) complain how there are just no takers for the wood. 

 Turns out, while they had called for bids from local lumber-yards the last time around, the poor response as dissuaded them from repeating the same this year. "There were as man y as 291 trees that fell down during the rains. While we used to sell them away earlier, we are not doing so this time. This because we found no takers last year," said V  , director, Urban Biodiversity Wing, GHMC, adding that the lumber-yards are only interested in wood like timber, which can be used for furniture. "There are no such trees planted in the city. We only have flowering trees, peepal and neem," he added. 
 
 When contacted, traders said that there was no point in buying these trees as they serve no purpose. "The trees that collapsed are not fit for any use. Earlier people used to buy wood for fires. Now, almost every house has a gas connection. So that leaves them with use," said  , a timberwood store owner based in  . He further said that the traders from the city procure their wood from other states, and are not dependent on the city's green debris.
