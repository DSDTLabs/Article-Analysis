BENGALURU: Vidhana Soudha police have filed an   against former corporator V   alias Naga, who   during a press conference on Friday.

 Nagaraj, who had in a suicide note accused several senior   leaders and police officers of targeting him, said his detractors were trying to prevent him from contesting the assembly elections. His supporters rushed him to a private hospital in the nick of time and he is currently under treatment.
 
 On Monday, a constable attached to Vidhana Soudha police station filed the attempt-to-suicide against Nagaraj. “Since none has come forward to file the complaint, our constable did it. We have booked Nagaraj under IPC section 309 (attempt to suicide). We will question him once doctors permit,” said a senior police officer.
 
 The officer added that though the Mental Healthcare Act has decriminalized suicide, the relevant section in the Indian Penal Code still exists and could be used in case of people attempting to end their lives to blackmail others or create nuisance or with any other ulterior motive. “Nagaraj was staging a drama and creating nuisance,” he added.
 
 Last May, police arrested Nagaraj after recovering Rs 14 crore in demonetised currency from his residence in Srirampura, north Bengaluru.
