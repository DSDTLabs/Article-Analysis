AURANGABAD: City MLA Imtiyaz Jaleel and 19 of his supporters, including a number of corporators, have been booked under the charges of dacoity in a case involving the ransacking of a   earlier this week. 

 Jaleel, the Aurangabad central MLA, and corporator Saira Bano Ajmal Khan, both from AIMIM, had led a protest against liquor shops and bars in the Chelipura area on Monday morning, when a mob went berserk ransacking one of the shops, burning its furniture and destroying several boxes of liquor. The shop has a license in the name of Asha Uttam Jadhav.
 
 Police registered a dacoity case against the MLA and others on Thursday, following a complaint by Jadhav's son, Santosh. The protesters had earlier been booked on the charges of committing mischief by causing petty fire.
 
 The MLA told TOI on Friday that the entire protest was held in the presence of police. "By registering a case of dacoity, they mean to say we committed dacoity in the presence of police."
 
 Jaleel said police personnel present during the protest should not only face action for remaining mute spectators to a dacoity incident, but should also be made co-accused in the case.
