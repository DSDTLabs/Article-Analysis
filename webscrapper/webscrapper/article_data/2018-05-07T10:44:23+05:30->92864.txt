PANAJI: Former chief minister   on Monday will file a written reply before the Goa Lokayukta objecting to allegations made against him while renewing 88 mining leases.“The policy to renew the leases was taken by my predecessor, chief minister  ,” he told TOI. Parsekar also said that as a cabinet colleague, he was part of the decision.

 
 Goa Lokayukta justice P K Misra had issued notices to Parsekar, former mines secretary P K Sain, and director of mines  , for the renewal of the 88 mining leases.
 
 Goa Foundation had filed complaint
 
 The notice was issued under Section 12 (2) of the Lokayukta Act. The first preliminary hearing in the case was recently held.
 
 Goa Foundation director   had filed the complaint.
 
 The Foundation earlier filed a complaint before the anti-corruption branch (ACB) of the directorate of vigilance and the   (CBI) to probe the lease renewal process. As both agencies didn’t initiate the probe, the case was filed before the Lokayukta.
 
 The complaint sought to investigate the circumstances that led to an en masse renewal of 88 mining leases in Goa to various private stakeholders, including one multinational corporation. The renewal, from November 1, 2014 to January 12, 2015, was through flagrant abuse of power and conspiracy by the respondents, the complaint stated.
 
 “The illegal second renewals were done in order to benefit these private persons and companies,” Goa Foundation stated in the complaint. “As a result of these renewals, they benefitted by operating the mining leases allocated for nearly three years from 2015-2018 till the intervention of the   which set aside all these illegal renewals.”
 
 Goa Foundation also said that the complaint is filed against the above-named persons for offences committed under Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, in the act of renewing these 88 mining leases for mining in Goa with a total annual production capacity of 44 million tonnes.
