Trichy: The war of words between T T V Dhinakaran, leader of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), and V K Divaharan, brother of jailed AIADMK leader V K Sasikala, continued on Thursday with TTV describing the latter’s outbursts as blabbering due to his ill health. The MLA said in Kumbakonam on Thursday that Divaharan had not been keeping well for quite some time and hence his words need not be taken seriously. Divaharan had earlier said that he would rather support chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami than Dhinakaran. On Wednesday, Dhinakaran replied to him stating that AMMK had no affiliation with Divaharan. Further, he claimed that Divaharan’s anger was aimed at Sasikala but was directed at him instead. “Divaharan may not be concerned about me but as a relative I am concerned about his ill-health. Hence, I have not taken his words seriously,” said Dhinakaran while refusing to take questions on the matter. TNN
