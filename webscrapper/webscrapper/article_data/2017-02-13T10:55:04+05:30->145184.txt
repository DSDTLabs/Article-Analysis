VADODARA: Local crime branch (LCB) of Mahisagar arrested one more person during the early hours of Sunday with a fake identity card and for helping Limadiya robbery accused Raj Vyas.

 Police said they had learnt from earlier arrests that Vikramsinh Rajput, a resident of Tarsali, was also involved in the loot that took place last week. On the basis of a tip-off about a black car, the cops were searching vehicles at Shignali Chowkdi on   on Saturday night. When Rajput reached the police check-post, the cops found a country-made gun and four live cartridges with him.
 
 “When we asked for the gun’s licence from Rajput, he told us that he is a sub-inspector with   (NIA) and showed his identity card but it was a fake one,” said LCB police inspector C C Khatana.
 
 Cops also found fake appointment letters of ONGC in Rajput’s car. On February 5, when Vyas was arrested, 11 youths had approached the police saying that Vyas had promised them jobs in ONGC and collected amounts varying from Rs3 lakh to Rs6 lakh from them.
 
 Khatana added that Rajput and Vyas had duped these youths together. Rajput admitted to the police during interrogation that he had made the appointment letters by placing fake logo and had printed them at his home. Khatana told TOI that the youths were duped in Vadodara city and therefore they were asked to register complaints against the accused at Karelibaug police station. “As of now, we have arrested Rajput under Arms Act and for helping Vyas in making duplicate identity cards,” he added.
 
 The police received two days custody of Rajput from a local court on Sunday.
 
 Vyas and his three other accomplices had raided the store of   with Vyas impersonating himself as deputy inspector general of police. The accused had taken away ornaments and cash worth Rs14.21 lakh.
