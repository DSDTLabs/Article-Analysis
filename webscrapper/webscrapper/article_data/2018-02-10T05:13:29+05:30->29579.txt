MUMBAI: Almost two weeks after   resident   died, after getting pulled towards an MRI machine at  , the civic-run institute got an estimate of Rs 80 lakh for the machine's repairs. Of this, Rs 25 lakh was the bill for "quenching" the magnetic field of the MRI machine, hospital authorities said. 

 Maru had walked into the MRI suite carrying an oxygen cylinder to help his ailing aunt on January 27. The cylinder, along with Maru, was immediately pulled by the machine's magnetic force. It is unclear how the cylinder's nozzle came loose and Maru breathed in all the gas that led to his death. An inquiry is under way.
 
 Meanwhile, the quenching exercise was necessary to remove the cylinder which was stuck to the machine along with Maru's finger. "This was also done to analyze the damage to the machine. Without quenching, the Philips engineers could not have made an assessment of parts that need to be replaced," said Nair Hospital dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal.
 
 The repair estimate will soon be placed before BMC . Incidentally, the hospital was in the process of ordering a new MRI machine when the accident occurred. The existing machine is over eight years old.
 
  "It is unfortunate the accident occurred at this juncture. It may take months, if not a year, to get a new machine if the present machine is not fixed," said a doctor.
