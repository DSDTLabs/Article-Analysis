PATNA: In an apparent snub to the opposition which has of late been questioning   Kumar’s secular credentials, the state’s JD(U)-BJP government led by him on Wednesday released Rs 36.13 lakh as compensation for people injured and assets, including a mosque, damaged in communal clashes during Ram Navami celebrations last month.

 Allotment letters for the same were on Thursday issued by the state home department, which is headed by Nitish. 
 
 The highest amount of Rs 25.3 lakh has been released to   where 40-odd shops were damaged or set ablaze on March 25 and 26, according to official records. The compensation letter states the Aurangabad DM would identify the owners of the damaged properties and disburse the amount to them.
 
 Another Rs 8.5 lakh has been sanctioned for payment to six people whose properties in   district were damaged during communal clashes on March 30 and 31.
 
 A sum of Rs 2.13 lakh has been sent to the Samastipur DM for getting repaired the Gudari Masjid and Madrassa Zia-ul Uloom in   block, which were damaged during communal clashes on March 27.
 
 Political observers said the prompt release of compensation funds was aimed at underlining Nitish’s commitment to communal harmony. The move assumes significance in view of the RJD-Congress’s charge following the communal disturbances that ‘Nitish has surrendered to communal forces’.
