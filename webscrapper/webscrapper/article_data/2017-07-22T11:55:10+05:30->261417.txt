 While Raulji could not be contacted, his son Malav Raulji said that the board had been removed as it was old and made from flex sheet. “It was torn and had to be removed. Also, we decided to remove the flags as they would have got soiled in the rains and may even get torn. Even the interior of the building is being spruced up,” said Malav.
 
 Malav pointed out that whenever any decision is taken by his father, it would be a public one. “We have nothing to hide,” he said.
