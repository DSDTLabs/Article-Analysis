GUWAHATI: Dismissing speculation of alliances with regional parties in  ,   said it will go it alone in the upcoming assembly election. The party has finalised its first list of candidates for all 60 seats and sent it to the party's central election committee for approval. 

 " Our stand right now is that we are contesting the election alone. The list of candidates we have sent to the central election committee is for all 60 seats. Whether we contest all of them or not will be decided by our central election committee," president of the Meghalaya unit of BJP Shibun   said. The list names 100 aspirants for party tickets. The final candidate list should be ready by next week. "Once the candidates are finalised, BJP will launch its election campaign in full swing," Lyngdoh said. 
 
 D enying the possibility of division of opposition votes hurting BJP's chances, Lyngdoh said, "Division of votes because of multiple regional parties in the fray isn't a new thing in Meghalaya. We are not worried about it. Over the years, we have cultivated a support base whose votes we are sure of." 
 
 A BJP leader said the decision to not ally with regional parties in Meghalaya was taken as a pre-emptive step against   accusing it of pursuing a religious agenda. "We do not want to give Congress the opportunity to create divisions within the society to distract people from its failures. BJP is fighting on an agenda of development," the leader added .
