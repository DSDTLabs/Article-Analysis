CHENNAI : Despite sluggish growth in global trade and competition from new ports, namely the   port,   has managed to generate a   of Rs 32 crore this financial year, as against Rs 13 crore in the previous financial year. 

 P Raveendran, chairman of the  , stressed on the significance of the completion of   elevated expressway for the fortunes of the port during his interaction with reporters here. “The expressway is going to be the lifeline for the port. We have learned that the contractors have submitted a report to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and it is encouraging,”   said.
 
 Speaking to TOI, a Port Trust official said they are seeking updates on the project with the central government. “While we want it to be completed as early as possible, a more practical expectation would be to wait for three years,” the official said.
 
 The cargo volume handled at the Chennai Port during the 2017-18 financial year was 51.88 million metric tons (MMT), which is 3MMT or 6% more than the target fixed by the shipping ministry. Container traffic accounted for a major chunk of this traffic about 30MMT, despite competition from emerging ports.
