PATNA: As part of its continuing efforts to improve punctuality of long- distance mail and express trains, the railways has decided to make full use of its online train tracking system which is based on SIMRAN (satellite imaging for rail navigation) technology adopted by the railways at its vital locations across the country.

 Talking to TOI on Wednesday, a   official said the new train tracking system would help passengers know the exact position of a train. Needless to say, it will be a big relief, especially when foggy weather conditions play havoc with railwaysâ€™ time table on the Kanpur-Allahabad-Mughalsarai-Patna mainline route, he said.
 
 According to him, the new system helps passengers know the position of trains through an online railway enquiry system, which can be reached at www.trainenequiry.com. This facility has been introduced in all zones of the railways, including Hajipur (Bihar)-headquartered   (ECR), he said.
 
 Under the new system, passengers can also know details of the train concerned, including its speed, late running, approaching stations, coach position etc online or by sending an SMS to the integrated railway inquiry number 139, he said.
 
 According to sources, SIMRAN was approved by the railways long back as a pilot project. Introduced on a trial basis in several railway zones, it proved quite successful. 
 
 The railways has also introduced a CBTC ( ) system on vulnerable and crowded routes in several railway zones, including the ECR. It is aimed at further improving the safety system during winter when dense fog adversely affects movement of passenger trains, the sources said.
