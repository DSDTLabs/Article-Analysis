NEW DELHI:   satraps from   have urged the party leadership to change the general secretary in-charge of state affairs, saying it should be a focus area of the pending organisational overhaul. 

 Amid intense lobbying for the reins of MP Congress, sources said the leadership has been forced to look at AICC general secretary   who looks after the state. A meeting of party principals from the state, called by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, witnessed intense discussion about who should head the MP unit, a two-horse race between senior MP and AICC general secretary   and Lok Sabha chief whip  . 
 
 The race appears tilted in favour of Kamal Nath, though an official decision is still to be taken. Sources said the new MPCC chief would be Congress’s chief ministerial face for elections to be held in December 2018. 
 
 Even as the competing claims of aspirants were being discussed, with Rahul all ears, the satraps are learnt to have voiced a common grievance against Mohan Prakash’s handling of the state. The huddle, which sources said also included Congress general secretary and former chief minister Digvijaya Singh, then spent some time discussing the subject. Sources said the MPCC chief will be announced as part of a package which will include a new AICC general secretary. The rejig is geared towards preparing the state unit for 2018 elections, with the idea that the new head should get enough time to rejuvenate workers and mobilise voters in the sprawling state which has virtually become an inpregnable BJP fortress. Interestingly, the proposed rejig of MP unit witnessed a curious sidelight when Prakash on Monday was reportedly asked not to visit the party headquarters on 24, Akbar Road, in the face of a surprise protest. A group of workers gathered at the AICC campus raising slogans against the general secretary.
