PANAJI: A video being circulated on   on Wednesday created panic among  , as it showed a girl being pinned down by two men at the back of a car, while the vehicle was in motion. A third, sitting beside the driver, was filming the scene.

 After mediapersons brought the video to the notice of he police, who promptly began investigation, a bizarre story unfolded.
 
 “We are given to understand that the girl had gone for a party in North Goa and, as per her family’s claims, she was possessed,” Mormugao DySP Sunita Sawant said late Wednesday night, adding that a lady police officer has been sent to her house to record the family’s statement.
 
 SP (crime) Karthik Kashyap said police swung into action after the video was brought to their notice. He said all the boys and the girl in the video were traced by late Wednesday evening. They all live in the same neighbourhood in Vasco and investigation is under way about the circumstances in which the video was made. “The circumstances under which the video was taken were entirely different from what they appear to be, we are told. One of the boys in the video is her brother,” Kashyap said.
 
 An offence will be registered if the girl states her intentions to do so, he said.
 
 Sources said that on being identified and questioned by the police, all involved in the video said that it does not convey the correct picture.
 
 In the video, the girl in a grey T-shirt and jeans is seen lying down at the back of the car. Her face isn’t visible, but she appears to be moaning in a manly voice, while two boys try to hold her down. A third, sitting besides the driver, filmed the scene.
 
 One of the men is seen talking over the phone and the other men are heard discussing about driving to Baina and appear to be talking about seeking some sort of assistance.
