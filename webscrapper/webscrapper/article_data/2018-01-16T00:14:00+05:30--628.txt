Chennai: Composting units will be set up at 74 more locations under the limits of Greater Chennai Corporation which has been sanctioned Rs 9.51 crore for the project following a meeting of the high-power committee set up for the purpose. Giving a boost to the waste segregation infrastructure to reduce the waste ending up in landfills, the proposal was made during the fifth meeting of the high-power committee but received approval during the next meeting at Ripon Buildings. The committee consisted of secretaries from the municipal administration and water supply department, the finance department and chairman of the Tamil Nadu Urban Finance and Infrastructure Development Corporation. At present, the corporation has five vermicomposting units and 149 composting units across the 15 zones. At the new locations, ordinary composting units will be set up for food waste to undergo biodegradation for 45 days to be converted to manure.  This waste can also be used for the production of biogas which can be used for cooking at designated Amma canteens. “Pit-type composting units will be set up in different zones for aerobic degradation of food and green waste into compost,” said an official. The capacity of the units will be 35 tonnes and they will help reduce addition of waste to the dumpyards, he said. Apart from the composting units, zone 1 – Thiruvotriyur, will be getting vegetable cutting machines to cut feed for the composting units in the particular zone, as per zonal officials. The civic body has been using the proceeds of the existing composting units as manure for corporation parks or selling the compost to residents. It is also engaged in producing biogas through units at two Amma canteens.
