PANAJI: Seeking the disqualification of health minister   from the state assembly, Congress on Friday approached the high court of Bombay at Goa with the petition that Rane be disqualified for five years.

 In the writ petition before the court, Congress argued that Rane should be asked to resign as health minister. The case will be heard on May 16.
 
 Congress has filed a case against speaker Pramod Sawant, Sidharth Kuncalienkar, election commission of India, Goa state election commission and the state government. The petition which is before the single judge bench of Mahesh Sonak seeks to prevent Rane from contesting the Valpoi byelections.
 
 All 16 Congress MLAs, including Raneâ€™s father Pratapsingh Rane, are petitioners in the case.
