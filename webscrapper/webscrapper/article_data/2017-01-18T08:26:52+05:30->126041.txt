HYDERABAD: MLAs belonging to the Congress and   (TDP) on Tuesday alleged in the   that the state government was showing discrimination in its crackdown on illegal buildings and encroachments of lakes. 

 Raising the issue,   Komatireddy   said that while the government bulldozed unauthorised buildings in Bandari Layout near Nizampet a few months ago, it has not taken any action against N-Convention Centre at Madhapur, despite evidence that its owner encroached upon two acres of a lake. He also said the government has not taken any action on the town planning staff, who turned a blind eye on unauthorised structures in Bandari layout and other areas of the city.
 
 Minister   said the government will not spare anybody and was not discriminating between influential and general people. He assured the house that the government will take action on N-Convention Centre management if it is found to have encroached on lake land.
