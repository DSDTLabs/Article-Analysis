New Delhi: Clothes designed by women inmates of   Jail will be used in a Bollywood   named Marksheet.   officials said that the apparel are products of the   lab that was set up at Tihar in February last year. The movie apparel were designed with the help of fashion designer Winky Sharma. This is the first time that jail inmates will be designing clothes for a feature film.

 On Tuesday, the cast and crew of the movie will be meeting the inmates at the fashion lab to share details about their characters so the clothes can be designed accordingly.
 
 The fashion lab was set up in accordance with the Skill India Mission launched by the government. The prison authorities had set up the lab with a private institute. The institute also trains inmates in the slash-and-spread method and in tracing the basic bodice.
 
 The lab is equipped with sewing machines, sewing kits and ironing machines, giving the trainees their first experience of designing a dress from scratch.
