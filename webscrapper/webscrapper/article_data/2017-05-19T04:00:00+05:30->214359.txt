AHMEDABAD:   CM  , members of his cabinet and senior police officers presented appointment letters to a record 18,217 new police recruits, at a ceremony on the Sabarmati riverfront on Thursday.

 Earlier this month, representatives of the state government told the   that of the 28,580 posts vacant for various ranks, recruitment for 17,000 posts had been done and appointment letters would be given out soon.

 The CM, in his speech at the ceremony, said that of the 50,000-odd police jobs filled in the last eight years, 2016 and 2017 alone accounted for 26,000.

Thus I expect from you that you won’t take anybody’s money and carry forward this ‘pramanikta nu parva, imandari no utsav’ (celebration of uprightness and honesty) through our work,” said Rupani. The CM also said that Gujarat takes pride in being one of the most safe state where women can venture out at night without fear and it is the police’s responsibility to continue the tradition.
