LUCKNOW: Accepting his defeat in the 2017 assembly elections as people’s mandate, chief minister   on Saturday quit as chief minister, and said the verdict suggested that a party could win elections by misleading people rather than convincing them.

 Dismissing reports that the SP–Congress alliance had failed to work, he said the two parties got 29% votes and its core voters stayed with them. “I’m happy about the alliance with the Congress and I believe the alliance will continue in future,” Akhilesh told reporters at the CM official residence here.
 
 Later, he went to governor Ram Naik to tender his  . The governor asked him to continue as CM till the formation of the new government.
 
 When asked if the   had punctured the SP’s cycle (election symbol), Akhilesh said: “I’ve always maintained that our cycle has tubeless tyres. It is just that we just couldn’t fill it with enough air. But it will not stop.”
 
 “I think the new government will work better than the SP. The farmers’ loans will be waived off in the first cabinet meeting and the government will built better roads,” Akhilesh said, adding: “Now I’m hoping the BJP waives debts of farmers across India.”
 
 Akhilesh said people probably did not like the Expressway that the SP government built, and instead they voted for a bullet train. The Agra Expressway was showcased during the SP’s poll campaign.
 
 Referring to Mayawati’s allegation that EVMs were tampered with, Akhilesh said the issue should be looked into since the charges were levelled by a political party. “We will seek a report from the booths and then take a call,” he said. The SP chief thanked people for giving him a chance to serve for five years.
