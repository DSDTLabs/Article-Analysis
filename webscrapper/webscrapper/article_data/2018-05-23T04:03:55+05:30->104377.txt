Ambehta Peer, Saharanpur: In a controversial remark, BJP’s   MP from  , Kanta Kardam, said, “Muslims have been harassing Hindus and one should be cautious about them.” She was speaking at a poll rally in Saharanpur district where she later shared the stage with UP CM  .

 
 Kardam urged people to come out in large numbers and vote for the party’s   candidate Mriganka Singh. “Make sure you have to go to Mriganka for help and not Tabassum,” Kardam said, referring to the grand alliance candidate   whose son Nahid Hasan is the SP MLA from Kairana. 
 
 Kardam is among several   leaders in UP who have been pressed into action for the crucial bypolls in Kairana and Noorpur. Kardam was BJP’s mayoral candidate in Meerut and suffered deafeat against BSP’s Sunita Verma. 
 
 The 53-year-old Dalit leader has been associated with BJP for 28 years. Kardam belongs to the Jatav caste, same as Mayawati, rose through the ranks starting as a booth-level worker to her current position as vice president of the Uttar Pradesh BJP. 
 
 BJP’s decision to send Kardam to Parliament is viewed as Yogi Adityanath’s move to create an alternative leadership to Mayawati in Dalit politics.
