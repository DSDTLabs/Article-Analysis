CHANDIGARH: Haryana cops have arrested sister of the main accused in the murder of 18-year-old Rajesh Singh who was shot dead at a government school in Sonipat district on March 22. 

 Rajesh, from Madina village in Sonipat district, was killed while he was waiting at playground of Government Senior Secondary School for Girls in Madina for his sister who was writing her Class X board exam on Thursday afternoon. Four men, including  , alias Pawna, a history-sheeter, came in a white sedan and opened fire at Rajesh. He was shot 10 times and died on the spot. Rajesh's friend  , who was sitting beside him, also suffered a bullet shot in his stomach.
 
 Kavita Singh, alias Geeta, sister of the main accused Pawan Kumar, was arrested on Friday night. She was produced in court on Saturday and was remanded to judicial custody. The same men had murdered Rajesh's elder brother five months ago.
 
 Barauda SHO Veer Bhan, confirmed Kavita was arrested on Friday night. "In fact, Kavita had come to Madina last month to attend a wedding. She had a tiff with Rajesh's family and provoked Pawan to settle scores and kill Rajesh. Pawan is a history-sheeter and had been serving life sentence for a murder in Rohtak. He was released on parole in September 2017 and murdered Rajesh's elder brother Rakesh Singh. We are conducting raids to arrest Pawan and his three other accomplices as well," said SHO Veer.
 
 Alleging police inaction, Rajesh's relatives blocked the Madina-Sonipat road and were booked and arrested by the police. Rajesh's father   alleged that despite repeated complaints at Barauda station, cops had failed to act against Kavita and Pawan.
