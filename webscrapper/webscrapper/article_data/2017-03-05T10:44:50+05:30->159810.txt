In a major boost to the residents of Coimbatore and Bengaluru, Union railway minister   has announced a new train between the two destinations. 

 Speaking at a function in Chennai on Saturday, Prabhu said, "The train will connect two important cities- Coimbatore, one of India's large industrial centres, and Bengaluru, one of the largest technology centres."
 
 Stating that there is a huge demand between these two sectors, Prabhu assured that the train will be operated in the shortest possible time and said the rolling stock has been ordered to be arranged soon. However, the minister did not specify if it would be a day train or an overnight service. With not a single train originating from Coimbatore to Bengaluru, there has been a growing demand to operate an overnight train between the two cities.
 
 A senior railway official said the train was a long-pending demand of residents and trading community of Coimbatore. 
 
 M Jameel Ahamed , chairman,  , said, "We request the railway ministry to operate the train overnight. Most youngsters from Coimbatore are forced to use Omni and SETC bus services. At present, very few seats are allotted for Coimbatore passengers on the Kanyakumari - Bengaluru Express." With Omni bus operators charging anywhere between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000 per ticket on weekdays and increasing it by 40% on Fridays and Sundays, many hope that new train service would provide them with a limited fare structure. 
 
 The railway ministry had announced a double decker service called the   last year. Though the timings and train numbers were slotted, the Uday Express has not seen the light of day due to non-availability of rake.
 
 When asked whether the proposed Uday Express would be scrapped for the newly-announced train, a senior railway official said the decision could be taken only by the   headquarters in Chennai.
