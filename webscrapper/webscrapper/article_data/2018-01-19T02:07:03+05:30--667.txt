NEW DELHI:   triple-riding a motorbike   were   after   with a   near   in southwest Delhi on Thursday afternoon.

 Eyewitnesses told police that the three teenagers tried to flee after spotting traffic policemen challaning vehicles on the stretch. They rammed the truck head-on. Following the incident, the truck driver, Ayodhya Pandey, left his vehicle and fled on foot. He was arrested an hour later from a shop nearby, DCP (southwest) Milind Dumbere said.
 
 Around 1pm, locals took the three youths — Firoz (17), Monu (15) and Rohit (16) — to a private hospital for treatment. Firoz and Monu were declared brought dead.
 
 Admitting their mistake, Rohit told TOI that they were driving in a zigzag manner. “Monu was driving, while Firoz was sitting in the middle. We were about to reach home when the accident happened. I don’t recall what happened after the collision as I fainted. I just remember shouting after seeing the truck heading towards us,” he added.
 
 “I saw my best friends die in front of me and that picture will haunt me till my last breathe. As it was a sunny day, we decided not to go to school and take a ride on the bike,” Rohit said.
 
 Firoz’s brother Muzaffar said that their father had gifted the bike to the teenager four months ago on his birthday. 
 
 “He had been asking for a bike and my father bought it on instalments. Firoz and his friends had recently learnt to drive it so that they could go for short rides,” he added.
 
 “My brother and his friends were sitting and playing carom when they decided to go for a ride. My parents are inconsolable after hearing the news of my brother’s death,” said Muzaffar.
 
 Police said that the boys lived in the same locality and studied in different schools. They were natives of Bihar.
