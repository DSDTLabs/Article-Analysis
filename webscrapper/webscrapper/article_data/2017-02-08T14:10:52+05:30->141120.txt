PATNA: The Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) on Tuesday released “alarming figures” on air pollution in Patna to underline the need for a concrete ‘Clean Air’ action plan to save citizens from pollution-related health disorders.
 
  According to CEED, the air quality assessment of Patna in terms of PM10 (particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter) concentration is generally three times the prescribed  , as is evident from a study done by the   during from the years 2009 to 2014.
  
  Even the assessment of Air Quality Index of Patna, done by the   as late as 2016, threw up   that smacked of “severe” level of air pollution that is extremely detrimental to human health, said the NGO at a national conference on ‘Clean Air Bihar: Addressing challenges and unlocking opportunities’ in Patna.
  
  “Particulate matter is the major contributor to pollution in Bihar capital with rise in vehicular emission, construction activities, residential stoves and unmanaged solid waste management being the main culprits,” said CEED CEO Ramapati Kumar.
  
  According to Kumar, Patna is one of the world’s most polluted cities despite the fact that the city or, for that matter, Bihar as a whole is a non-industrialized region. “Construction activities are executed in open in violation of guidelines; waste management is done in open with vehicles carrying garbage without covering it and e-rickshaws are not promoted with there being no recharge points for them in the city,” Kumar said, listing them as the factors behind pollution in Patna.
  
  Bihar State Pollution Control Board’s senior scientist S N Jaiswal stressed the importance of spreading awareness among people about pollution concerns. Mahavir Cancer Sansthan’s Ashok Ghosh, while sharing details of the health implications of air pollution, urged the government and people to take care of the environment and secure the lives of the present and future generations.
