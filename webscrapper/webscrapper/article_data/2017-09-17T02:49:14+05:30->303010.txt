KOLKATA: A warm wind blowing in from the northeast turned Kolkata hot and humid on Saturday. According to the Met office, a cyclonic circulation above   provided moisture that added to the discomfort. But the   could change from Monday and sporadic showers could lash parts of the city. 

 Kolkata recorded a maximum temperature of 36°C while the maximum relative humidity touched 91% on Saturday.
 
 Met officials said that even though a cyclonic circulation exists in the  , it will not have a major impact on the city weather. “The existing circulations are not strong enough to trigger heavy showers or lower the temperature. But a circulation in Bangladesh is generating moisture, which is flowing in with the wind. It has pushed up the humidity and turned the conditions extremely uncomfortable,” said G K Das, director, RMC.
 
 This moisture flow could be cut off on Monday, Das added. “The circulations could intensify marginally and the moisture flow could be off from Monday. Once that happens, the mercury will spiral down. This will make the weather more pleasant.”
 
 This month has been exceptionally warm and dry so far. Last Thursday, Kolkata’s real feel temperature – calculated taking into account factors like cloud cover, wind, sun intensity, humidity and temperature – had shot to 47.1°C according to a private weather forecasting service. Over the last week, the average humidity had been around 70% and often touched 90%. The principal trigger behind the choking weather was the absence of rain, said Met officials. 
 
 “Once showers stop, the mercury shoots up and the humidity makes it uncomfortable. It is the temperature which is making the difference here, not the humidity which remains high even when it rains. But showers pull the mercury down, which is not happening now,” Das added.
