Chandigarh: PGIMER director Prof Jagat Ram inaugurated Advanced Microbial Research Facility in the ground floor of Research Block A of PGIMER on Tuesday.

 The newly inaugurated extension of the department of medical microbiology will have advanced research facility in three specialized areas. The first laboratory will study neglected bacterial diseases, including rickettsial infections like scrub typhus, leptospiral infections and other diseases like bartonellosiscaused by bacteria which are difficult to isolate resulting in lack of good diagnostic tests and understanding of the epidemiology and preventive approaches.
 
 Right now, there is no laboratory for rickettsial disease and isolation of the organism in India, though the disease is increasingly reported. Scrub typhus incidence is rising in Chandigarh and its surroundings. This facility, therefore, will help in early diagnosis of the disease. The second facility inaugurated today will conduct advanced studies in antimicrobial resistance, its molecular epidemiology in the community and hospital and strategies for prevention of the emerging menace of multi-drug resistance in bacteria.
