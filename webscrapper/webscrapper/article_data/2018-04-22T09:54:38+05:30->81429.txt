CHENNAI: Politicians are looting money that’s much more than the turnover of the government-run   (State Marketing Corporation that manages liquor outlets), said actor-turned politician Kamal Haasan. “Tasmac is a business venture and it makes huge revenue. Whether it is good for society or not is not the question. If you start calculating the money our politicians  , it will be larger than what Tasmac makes,” said  , who heads  .

 Speaking on “We the Change”, organised by the Chennai International Centre in the city on Saturday, Haasan said, “It was the anxiety and fear about where we are heading to, that led me to politics. But I am not here to perform miracles. I am here to remind you what we should do,” he said.
 
 Later, during an interactive session, when he was asked what he would do first as a politician, Haasan replied, he would create smart villages. Asked whether he would get elected if he contested, Haasan said he would but did not wish to reveal his party’s strategy. “We are living in a debt-ridden state with high revenue deficit. The new assembly house has been converted into a (multispecialty) hospital. It’s ridiculous. It’s like converting an opera house into a hospital. We need to change it,” he said. 
 
 On the six entwined hands on MNM’s  , he said the southern part of India could be called Dravidian. “A   movement is the need of the hour. Political   change over time. But, Dravidian is pan Indian. I truly believe that   India could easily be called Dravidian. The six hands on MNM symbolise six states,” he said.
