NEW DELHI: Two brothers, who would call people posing as   from SBI’s   unit and offer them lucrative deals to   them, have been arrested. One of the youths had recently graduated from the Delhi University and had bought an SUV with the duped money.

 DCP (west)   said that the youths, Ankit and Ankush Rawal, stayed with their family in west Delhi’s  . “An enquiry was initiated by the cyber cell after we had received a complaint from the   credit cards department about fraudsters duping several customers and withdrawing hefty sums,” said DCP Kumar.
 
 The men would ask for the customer’s account number and customer id for verification, which they would then punch in to apply for a new credit card. The siblings would mention their own address in the column asking for the delivery location. Once they received the card, they would use a POS machine to transfer money from the credit card into their current account. A team from cyber cell found that as soon as the transfer went through, the money would be immediately spend, so customer would not know about the hefty loan in their name. 
 
 It was found that the youths had accessed the data used by the SBI credit card customer care units. They had account number and other details of customers so they sounded authentic while speaking to them. 
 
 “Further investigation is in progress to find out involvement of the men in similar offences and complete the chain of arrests,” said a police officer.
 
 Cops also suspect the role of an insider from the SBI credit card department to have supplied details of the customers to the accused.
