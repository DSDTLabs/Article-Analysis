Just when you are hoping for a different sound, D Imman disappoints with a standard tune featuring the tabla and harmonium in familiar beats. However, the song will still become a hit, thanks to seasoned singer,  , who elevates it with her melodious voice. The theme track, Melancholic Ride, is unlike most theme songs. It is soft and only towards the second half of the track that it gets a little charged. His Semma Joru is a simple and fun track. Though the tune doesn’t stand out, Vishal Dadlani impresses with his high-voltage voice. The chorus portion is striking and the composer has used the saxophone extensively in this one. Kavitha Thomas, too, is part of this tract that has nothing much to offer for the female vocalist. Listen to the track a few times to start liking it. 
 
 Add Langu Langu Labakaru to the list of children’s songs from Kollywood. With comical lyrics, the song mainly features a chorus, though certain portions are crooned by debutante Praniti, who sounds adorable. This cute number has a very retro feel to it and leaves you with a pleasant feel. The show stopper of the album is Yembuttu Irukkuthu Aasai, a slow, romantic number that has been well orchestrated. The use of sarangi in this track is magnificent. The rustic lyrics by Yugabharathi also needs special mention. Though the tune is nothing out of the ordinary, the vocals by   and Kalyani Nair sure make a world of difference. Both the singers have done justice to their portions. Can there ever be a D Imman music without an kuthu number? Lalaa Kadai Saanthi is that number in this album. The song begins with some rock beats but leads into a folk number. Benny Dayal and Sunidhi Chauhan are perfect for this track with their strong voice.
