AHMEDABAD: In an important judgment, the   high court has clarified the permissible role to be played by the victim or aggrieved complainant in a criminal trial. The court said that victims or their counsel can make written submission, but cannot be allowed to address the court over and above the points presented by the  .

 While dealing with a petition filed in connection with a case of abetment of suicide in   police station, Justice   said that the Criminal Procedure Code indicates that the complainant or victim “is not altogether wiped out from the scenario of the trial merely because investigation was taken over by the police and the chargesheet was laid by them. Even the fact that the court had taken cognizance of the offence is not sufficient to debar him from reaching the court for ventilating his grievance”.
 
 The   said that in sessions court, public prosecutor in the only authority to conduct the prosecution, but the original complainant is not debarred from participating in the trial. “He can participate in the trail to the extent as provided under section 30192) of the CrPC. It is always open for the victim to submit written arguments, and if such written arguments are tendered, the court has a duty to consider such arguments before taking a decision. However, he cannot, as a matter of right, assert that his counsel should also be permitted to make oral arguments over and above the arguments that may by canvassed by the public prosecutor,” the court said.
