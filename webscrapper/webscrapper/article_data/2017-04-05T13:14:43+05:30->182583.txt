THANE: By securing a place in the   management institutions in the country, city-based Dr V N Bedekar Institution of Management Studies has placed not only itself, but also the city on the national map for probably the very first time.

 The Human Resource Development Ministry's National Institutional Ranking Framework’s 2017 India rankings revealed that the   institution was in the top 100 national institutes in a number of criteria, including the quality of education, management development programs, quality research papers, placement and so on.
 
 Dr Vijay Bedekar, president and trustee of the institution, said, “This is a moment of pride not only for us, but also for the city as this is the first time an institution from Thane has been placed in the government ranking system. Our main focus lies in the development of the students in terms of the quality of education and how it helps them in getting a good job and having a successful career. For this, the faculty also is encouraged to keep learning and expanding their knowledge base so as to pass it on to students. Now that our efforts have been recognised nationally, I’m sure out faculty and students will be encouraged and motivated to keep learning and expanding their knowledge.”
