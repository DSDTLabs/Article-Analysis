NEW DELHI: Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president   held an interactive session with street vendors in Jahangirpuri on Friday under the party’s campaign, ‘Dilli ki baat, dil ke saath’.

 Maken while addressing the gathering of vendors made big-ticket announcements that if Congress is voted to power in the upcoming municipal polls to be held on April 23, they will issue licences to 5 lakh street vendors. “There are 5 lakh street vendors across Delhi but everyone does not have a license or the space to function. We will identify the space for them and issue licences to all of them if we come to power,” said Maken.
 
 Slamming the AAP-led Delhi government,   said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has been in power in Delhi for the past two years and three months, and the BJP-ruled corporations have completely failed to implement the Street Vendors Protection Act, passed by the UPA government, to safeguard the interest of street vendors.
 
 Maken said, “According to the Act, the street vendors that make 2.5% of Delhi’s total population should have been given licences after identifying spaces for them, but so far nothing has been done.” He added that according to the Act, it is mandatory to give spaces to vendors, which would have freed them from harassment by the municipal authorities and the police. “But the AAP government and the BJP-led corporations have not taken any action to implement the Act. As a result, the street vendors are forced to shell out Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 to bribe the police and the authorities on a daily basis,” he added.
 
 Maken said even if Rs 1,000 is charged as monthly licence fee from each street vendor, the corporations would be able to mop up Rs 600 crore annually and that money can be used to pay the salaries of sanitation workers on time.
