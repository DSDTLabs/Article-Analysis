HYDERABAD: Six engineering students had a narrow escape when their SUV crashed into footpath and overturned near Khairatabad junction in the early hours of Thursday. The students escaped unhurt and police said the youngster driving the SUV was not under the influence of alcohol.

 At 12.30am on Thursday, a red Scorpio moving from Errum Manzil to Khairatabad crashed into the footpath a few yards before the   (ASCI) gate near Khairatabad X Roads.
 
 Due to the impact of the collision, the SUV swerved by 180 degrees and fell onto its side. Oil from the vehicle also started leaking after the high-speed accident. Luckily the six students inside the vehicle, including driver  , managed to survive the accident unhurt, Panjagutta inspector   said.
 
 After the incident, the students of   abandoned the vehicle and fled from the location as people started gathering at the accident spot. During the subsequent probe, Panjagutta police found the students were returning home after attending annual festival on the college campus at Kandlakoya, Medchal.
 
 The students had booked a Scorpio (TS 07 UF 2181) from self drive car rental website, Zoomcar, to attend the annual festival. As there was huge rush at dinner counters on the campus, the students came to the city to have biryani. “However, they found most restaurants were closed and when they were driving towards Khairatabad, the accident occurred due to speeding. All the students were engineering final year students and Parthav has a driving licence, and he was not in a drunken condition,” Panjagutta sub-inspector (SI) K   said.
 
 After the mishap, police removed the vehicle from the location of the accident to prevent traffic jam and they also put sand on the oil spillage to prevent vehicle skidding. Police registered a rash driving case under section 184 of the MV Act.
