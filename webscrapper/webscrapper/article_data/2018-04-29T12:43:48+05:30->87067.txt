PUNE:   pacer  , who left the field with a hamstring injury on Saturday after sending down 2.1 overs, is set to be out of action for at least two weeks.

 
 The 25-year-old pacer, who has been impressive this season claiming six wickets, couldn’t finish his full quota of four overs after he walked off the field early during Mumbai’s chase. Chahar has been quite effective with the new ball for   and played a major part in their victory against Sunrisers Hyderabad picking up three crucial wickets right at the top.
 
 Coach Stephen Fleming termed it a “blow” for CSK. “It’s definitely a blow for us and we have to see what we need to do going forward,” Fleming said after the match.
 
 CSK have suffered quite a few injury blows right from the start of this  . Kedar Jadhav, who was a key member of the side, suffered a hamstring injury in the first match of the season against Mumbai Indians and was ruled out for the entire tournament with England’s David Willey replacing the Indian batsman.
 
 A few matches later, there was an injury scare to talismanic batsman Suresh Raina, who suffered a calf strain and had to miss a match. But fortunately for CSK, the belligerent southpaw was up and running quickly.
 
 Meanwhile, South African pacer Lungi Ngidi, who had gone back to South Africa after the death of his father, has joined the CSK squad.
