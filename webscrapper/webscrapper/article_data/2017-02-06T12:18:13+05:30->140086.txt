MUMBAI: A woman   corporator from Thane on Sunday approached the police alleging that her estranged husband attacked her with a coconut when she visited a temple.  , who represents  , and her husband Manik Patil are locked in a divorce battle for a long time.

 Manik’s supporters have rubbished the claim saying Sangita was using her marital discord to malign her husband as the Sena had not given her a ticket for Thane civic body elections this time. Instead, they said, the party has chosen Manik for the ward.
 
 In her complaint to Shrinagar police, Sangita said it all started when she visited a temple in   locality. The scene turned ugly when Manik apparently reached the same place of worship with supporters.
 
 The couple got into a heated argument. Sangita said Manik began manhandling her. “I was pushed and assaulted by him and his supporters. He even hit me with a coconut that I had brought as an offering,” she said in her complaint. Sangita said she fell to the ground. “I was left shaken. My head had serious injuries.” Last year, the corporator had filed a police complaint against her husband, accusing him of conspiring to attack her office and being a threat to her life. “Since the last time, I have been asking for police protection as Manik can grievously harm me,” she said.
 
 The Shrinagar police have lodged a non-cognizable complaint – these pertain to cases which are not much serious in nature. Constable P D Karande said, “We are investigating if the commotion was planned or was it an attempt to cause harm to the complainant. The couple has already filed for divorce.”
 
 While Manik Patil was unavailable for comments, his supporters termed the complaint a ploy to spoil his image before the elections. Elections for 130 seats at   will be held on February 21.
