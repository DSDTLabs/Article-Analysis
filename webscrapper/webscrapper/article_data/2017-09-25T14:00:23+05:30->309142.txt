 The singer did not reach mainstream fame until his later years, releasing his debut album 'No Time for Dancing' in 2011, followed by 'Victim Of Love' in 2013 and 'Changes' last year.
 
 An extended statement was shared on Bradley's Facebook page, which said, "Mr. Bradley was truly grateful for all the love he's received from his fans and we hope his message of love is remembered and carried on."

 He was raised by his grandmother until he was 8, when his mother returned and moved with him to Brooklyn with her.
 
 By his early teens, he was largely homeless, living on subway trains and in old cars, wherever he could find shelter.

 He soon began performing Brown's songs as   while also working as a handyman.
