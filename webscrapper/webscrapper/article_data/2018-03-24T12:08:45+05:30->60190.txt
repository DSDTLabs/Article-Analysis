Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras   on Friday dismissed the case filed by a couple against actor   accusing him of perjury. Justice  , who heard the case, dismissed it by stating that it was not maintainable in court.

 The couple -  , 65, and his wife Meenakshi, 53, from Melur in Madurai, who claims he is their son, had filed the case. On April 21, a magistrate court had quashed the couple’s plea, which claimed that he is their son and demanded maintenance, on the grounds that the petitioners did not make out a prima-facie case for trial and that their petition was devoid of merit. 
 
 The bench quashed the petitioners’ plea based on the   and school transfer certificate produced by the actor before the high court. The couple claimed that the actor had forged the documents and submitted the same before the high court to defeat the ends of justice.
