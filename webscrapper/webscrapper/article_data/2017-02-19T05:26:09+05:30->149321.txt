 ( ): As people in Saifai, the ancestral village of SP patriarch   Singh Yadav, cast vote on Sunday, one question is being hotly debated: Who will Mulayam accompany when he comes to vote, brother Shivpal or son Akhilesh. The SP netas will vote in Saifai, which falls under the Jaswantnagar constituency from where Shivpal is contesting.

 Except those contesting, all others from Mulayam's family are expected to reach Saifai for voting after 9 pm. Youths sitting in the lawns of CM  's residence were busy guessing Netaji's preference. “ Akhilesh bhaiyya and wife Dimple are expected at 9.30am, while it is not clear whether Netaji will come with them,“ they said.
