NEW DELHI: Union minister   on Thursday lamented the "almost nil" presence of judges from SCs, STs and backward castes in higher judiciary, and said the recent "spontaneous" protests of   against an apex court order on SC/ST Act was a pointer to their "apprehensions" about the institution.

 
 The chief of   also announced a 'Halla bol, darwaja khol' (raise your voice, open the door) campaign to press for "rightful" representation of people from these communities, besides the poor and minorities, in the SC and HCs.
 
 Kushwaha, whose party is an ally of BJP, alleged that the judiciary may a be a strong pillar of democracy but "there is no democracy within it". "The   should come out with a white paper and tell us how many judges have come from poor families," he said. Referring to the recent violent protests by Dalit groups against an SC order which they said had diluted a law on prevention of atrocities against them, Kushwaha said such "nation-wide spontaneous protests" against a verdict of the SC was a matter of concern. It shows their apprehensions, he said.
 
 Due to lack of representation, these communities do not have much faith in the judiciary he said.
 
 "Not only do the people from Dalit, tribal and other backward classes (OBCs) have a negligible presence in the Supreme Court and high courts, but even deserving candidates from common families of general castes find it difficult to reach a judge's position," he said.
