CANACONA: A restaurant in   was gutted in a fire, with goods and cash worth Rs 15 lakh destroyed on Saturday morning.

 The complainant, restaurant owner,  , told Canacona police that his neighbour Justin Fernandes allegedly set fire to his restaurant at 9.30am. Corte alleged that one of the waiters at his restaurant saw Fernandes setting it on fire. “All furniture, including four deep freezers, mobile phones, cloth and cash of Rs 1 lakh were destroyed. The total loss is estimated at Rs 15 lakh,” said police.
 
 A mob of 40-50 persons gathered at the site and beat up Fernandes, who was admitted to Hospicio, Margao, with serious injuries. “We could not arrest Fernandes as he is severely injured. He will be arrested after he is declared fit,” said Canacona PI Filomeno Costa.
 
 Local residents were also furious that the fire tender took almost 50 minutes to arrive, although Canacona fire station is 15km away from Xelim. 
 
 When contacted, station fire officer Mahadev Lolienkar said, “Our vehicle is 17-years-old and does not respond well. It takes a very long time to climb up slopes.” Local residents say that had the fire tender arrived earlier, the loss would have been minimized.
