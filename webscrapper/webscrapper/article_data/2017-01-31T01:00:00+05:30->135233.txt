She is synonymous with intense, power-packed performances. But now,   is all set to explore a genre she is not usually associated with — comedy. The actress is the latest star addition to '  Again', the upcoming installment of Rohit Shetty’s hit franchise 'Golmaal'. 
“I wasn’t shocked or surprised when I was offered the film. I have always loved the 'Golmaal' series and was quite excited about being a part of it. Ajay (Devgn) is a friend and I also know the remaining cast, and working with friends is always wonderful.” 
 We point out that she looks too serious to be part of a comedy, and she says, “Nobody can laugh all the time. People close to me know my funny side. Also, comedy is one of my favourite genres.” 
 By her own admission, Tabu laughs very easily. “I remember watching 'Om Shanti Om' at a theatre in Hyderabad. My sister was watching the same show with her friends and she didn’t know that I was there. In the middle of the film, she called to ask if I was in the theatre, too. When I asked her how she found out, she said that she could hear my laughter. I love to be around people, who have a good sense of humour. All my friends are funny.” 
 Considering her love for comedy, why hasn’t she been a part of one since ' ' (2000)? Is her serious image a stumbling block? “I really don’t have any preferences, biases or prejudices against any kind of cinema. I take up whatever is interesting. People will always approach you with what they think you are good at. I am glad that there are certain kind of roles people identify me with. At the same time, it’s great that somebody like Rohit thought of casting me in a film like 'Golmaal',” she replies.
