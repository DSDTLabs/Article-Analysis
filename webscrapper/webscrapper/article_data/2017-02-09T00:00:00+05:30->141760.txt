Buddies   and   are all set to team up for a comedy. Nadirshah confirmed to us that he would indeed be directing his friend Dileep soon but is yet to finalise if that will be his next project.
 
 “Right now I am in discussions with two other films, apart from the Dileep movie. One is with   in the lead that will be scripted by Benny P Nayarambalam and another is the Tamil remake of  . So, it’s too soon to say which project will go on floors first,” says the director.
  
 On the Dileep movie, which is scripted by Saji Pazhoor, Nadirshah says, “It will be a comedy. That’s what people are expecting from us too. I want it to be better than the two movies I have directed earlier.”
  
 The director says that his current challenge for the Malayalam projects is getting the scripts ready and then finalising the dates with the artistes. “Both Mammukka and Dileep are busy actors, and they will have to like the subject and then give us the dates, which will again take some time,” he says.
  
 Nadirshah says that the only script he has ready right now is that of the Tamil remake of his latest directorial, Kattapanayile Rithwik Roshan that had Vishnu Unnikrishnan in the lead. “We had approached Sathyaraj for a pivotal role but he’s busy with Baahubali 2 and a few more films. We are hoping to cast Vishnu in the lead for the remake too but that again is decided by the commercial possibility,” he says. “You can’t do a movie in Tamil at the snap of a finger. The project is on but it will take its time.”
