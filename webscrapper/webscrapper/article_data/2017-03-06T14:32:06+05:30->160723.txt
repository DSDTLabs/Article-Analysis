The details show that the highest duty paid was Rs1,23,66,357 by 844 people between April 1, 2016 and January 1, 2017. The lowest recovery was Rs50,36,575 from 1009 between April 1, 2012, and March, 31, 2013. 
 
 On the seizure of goods, it stated that goods worth Rs5,25,79,747 was recovered from 49 violators in the last five years. The period between April 1, 2013 and March 31, 2013, saw highest recovery of Rs1,83,85,066 from 7 violators. The articles included gold jewellery and Indian currency notes.

 Kolarkar had also sought details about customs staff deployed at the airport. The department replied that two assistant commissioners, nine chief officers, 12 inspectors, two head constables, and two drivers are posted with the air customs unit. 
 
 Kolarkar said, “Until now, we didn’t know what was happening at Nagpur airport. Often, I saw four or five officials there but there was no information about customs. The seizure of goods worth Rs5crore indicate that Nagpur airport can’t be neglected and officials need to keep a tight vigil. At Mumbai, more offenders are caught regularly. My query proved that people do attempt to evade custom duty through the Nagpur airport.”
