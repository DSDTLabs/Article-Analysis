CHANDIGARH: The screening of a short film based on  's ode to Banaras - 'Banaras: Ka'ba-e-Hindostan' - mesmerised the audience at Principal PL Anand Auditorium, Panjab University, on Wednesday. 

 Directed by Beenu Rajpoot, the film has been selected for the International Short Film Festival, which is scheduled to be held in Srinagar later this month.
 
 Centred on Ghalib's stay in Banaras in 1827-28, the film captures the Urdu poet's unparalleled expression of love for the place.
 
 Calling Banaras the Mecca in India, Ghalib acknowledged Banaras as the place for salvation -- a place that can make everyone forget sorrows.
 
 The 32-minute short film also highlights the contrast that Banaras embraces - wide open ghats (banks) to claustrophobic avenues.
 
 The movie throws light on Ghalib's letters to his friends in which he describes the beauty of the ghats, fresh air, and mornings of Banaras.
 
 The film shows Ghalib observing that if he were to stay in Banaras, he would have broken all customs, put a tilak on his forehead, worn a janeu and dived deep into the waters of Ganga.
 
 Commenting on the relevance of the short film in social context, Beenu said the underlying message of the film was on sustaining communal harmony.
