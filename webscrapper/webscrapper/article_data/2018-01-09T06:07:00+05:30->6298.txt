 Information received by RTI activist Abhay Kolarkar on human deaths, injuries, cattle kills, crop damage cases and compensation thereon revealed that there has been a drastic fall in all the three category of cases.
 
 The state government paid Rs 3.22 crore towards human kills by wild animals for 42 cases till December 2017. During the same period in 2016, 52 humans were killed and a compensation of Rs 4.16 crore was paid.

 At a time when a hue and cry has been raised for crop damage cases, a drop has been reported. In 2016, the forest department paid Rs 8.88 crore towards 23,959 cases but in 2017, 13,888 cases were reported and Rs 5.90crore was paid as damages.
 
 PCCF (wildlife) AK Misra said, “We never claimed that the (man-conflict) conflict has increased. It has just been hyped. I feel it has stabilized. Huge awareness among locals is one of the reasons why it is going down. It also shows that people have been learning to co-exist. Media has also played a key role.”
 
 State wildlife board member Kishor Rithe feels the drop in fuelwood consumption is the turning point, especially after subsidized LPG distribution to people in forested villages.
 
 “The Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Jan Van Vikas Yojana is delivering results. Besides, in the recent conflict cases, it has been observed that the department is responding to situations. Another reason I feel is that in many forested villages, lights have reached reducing conflict situations,” said Rithe.
 
 Central India advisor of Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) Prafulla Bhamburkar said joint efforts by NGOs and forest department are yielding results. Due to better monitoring, conflict is being controlled, he said.
 
 Decrease in crop damage cases may be due to bad crop owing to scanty rainfall, besides more and more farmers going for solar fencing. “Cattle kills going down may be an indication of prey base improving, but again, it has to be proved scientifically,” Bhamburkar added.
