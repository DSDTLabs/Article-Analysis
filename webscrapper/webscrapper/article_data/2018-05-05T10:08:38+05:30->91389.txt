PUNE: A special court on Friday convicted and sentenced a 22-year-old man to four years'   (RI) for   on a minor girl at her house in Shirur in March 2015. 

 "Accused Akshay alias  , who was out on bail during the trial, was taken into custody and sent to the Yerawada jail soon after the judgment was pronounced," additional public prosecutor Sunil More told TOI. 
 
 Special judge R N Sardesai found Dalvi guilty of offences punishable under Section 7 read with 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act which deals with sexual assault, and under Section 452 (house trespass) of the IPC. "The court sentenced him to four years' RI with a fine of Rs 2,000 for the POCSO offence and six months in jail and Rs 1,000 fine for the   offence," More said. 
 
 The survivor (7) and the accused stay in the same locality in Shirur. The girl's parents were away at work when the sexual assault occurred on March 18, 2015. 
 
 The incident came to light when her mother returned home around 1.30pm for lunch and found the accused touching her daughter inappropriately and having partially removed the child's clothes. The mother then confronted and slapped the accused, who ran away from the spot. Later, a complaint was lodged with the police. 
 
 More examined the survivor, her mother and a boy from the neighbourhood, who had witnessed the accused committing the alleged acts, during the trial. The accused took a defence of false implication, claiming that he was not present in the house on the day of the incident and was implicated by the survivor's mother because he knew about the latter's extra-marital affair. 
 
 "The accused, however, could not provide any evidence in support of his defence alibi. On the contrary, the evidence recorded by the survivor stood corroborated by the eye witness evidence of her mother and the witness boy from the neighbourhood," More said. 
 
 The same was not shaken by their cross examination, he added.
