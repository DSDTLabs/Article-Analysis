As if road rage weren’t bad enough, now even minor things like brushing against a person or an inconvenient delay seem to be provoking Delhiites into whipping out knives and guns.
 
  data seems to confirm this. While the number of murders declined from 528 in 2016 to 487 in 2017, murders over trivial issues or sudden provocation as a cause rose from 16% to 18.6%.
 
 What makes people turn violent over petty issues? One of the first studies to examine the differences between impulsive murders and premeditated crimes was conducted by   in the US. “Impulsive murderers were much more mentally impaired, in terms of both their intelligence and other cognitive functions,” wrote  , an expert in clinical psychiatry and neurology and senior author of the 2013 study.
 Nearly all impulsive murderers have a history of alcohol or drug abuse and/or were intoxicated at the time of the crime — 93%, compared to 76% of those who strategised about their crimes.
 
 Criminologist   says most perpetrators in such cases experience “explosive rage”. “Such people are already deeply angry with themselves and the world and often suffer from impulse control disorder. Very often they consider themselves to be failures and victims.” And when a fight over a trivial issue occurs, it touches a raw nerve and acts like a trigger. Such people often report a feeling of calmness after the act. “Their vital signs like blood pressure go down and they experience a high,’’ says Mitra.
