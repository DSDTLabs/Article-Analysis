NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear petitions contending that state governments of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Haryana were liable for contempt for their failure to maintain law and order amid violent protests against screening of ‘Padmaavat’. The petitions also sought contempt proceedings against   for instigating violence. 

 Two petitions were mentioned before a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra who agreed to hear the case on Monday. The petitions contended that the state governments and Karni Sena failed to comply with the apex court’s order to maintain law and order after it upheld the plea for Padmaavat’s release. 
 
 One   was filed by Congress sympathiser Tehseen Poonawalla against state governments and the other by lawyer Vineet Dhanda seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against Karni Sena and its office-bearers for violent protests against the movie in several states. 
 
 Poonawalla contended that state governments did not take stern action against Karni Sena and allowed it to go ahead with disruptive activities, resulting in law and order problems. He said the states failed to comply with the apex court’s order asking it to take steps to prevent such incidents. 
 
 Dhanda submitted that the court must act tough against Karni Sena as it had “crossed every limit, hereby tarnishing the image of the apex court”. 
 
 “If such contempt of court is not stopped, then in future such anti-national and anti-social elements will have the audacity to even abuse judges even inside the courtrooms. The conduct of contemnors are tantamount to scandalising the courts and tend to lower the authority of the SC. It is again tantamount to interfering with the due process of judicial proceedings,” Dhanda’s petition said.
