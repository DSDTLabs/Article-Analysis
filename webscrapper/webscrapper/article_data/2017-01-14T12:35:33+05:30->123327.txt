HUBBALLI: In a bid to respond to crises with greater alacrity, the   is all set to launch 25 multi-purpose  , meant to ensure that the public do not have to wait for long for police aid, once they have contacted the control room.

 The 25 vehicles, which will be equipped with walkie-talkies, surveillance cameras, speakers, GPS facilities among others, will be inducted into active service by home minister G Parameshwara on January 27.
 
 Hubballi-Dharwad police commissioner Pandurang Rane told TOI that the vehicles would also be equipped with a feature called ‘dial 100’. “When someone calls the control room, and provide their name and location, the control room will immediately direct the patrol vehicles to the spot,” he added.
 
 He pointed out that an exclusive command control room would be formed to monitor the new patrol vehicles. “Under this system, we will document all the information about complaints – the number of complaints filed, the response time, the number of complaints attended to, etc.,” Rane said. 
 
 Each of the 25 vehicles will have a small investigation team, with an assistant sub-inspector rank officer entrusted with the responsibility of the patrol vehicle.
 
 Sources indicated that there was a scarcity of drivers attached to the commissionerate. However, it is likely that the department will depute around 15 drivers of the Chalukya patrol vehicles for the new ones. Admitting to the shortage of drivers, Rane said, “We will manage with the existing drivers.”
