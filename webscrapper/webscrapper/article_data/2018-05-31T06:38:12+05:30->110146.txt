AHMEDABAD: It is keeping to his profession of a tattoo artist that gave away an absconding rapist,  , 10 years after he jumped parole in 2008, being convicted of raping a 14-year-old girl.

 Crime branch officials said Vaghela was nabbed from Mumbai on Tuesday, after the newly formed social media intelligence unit ( ) of the crime branch, got his details from a social media platform, where he had put advertisements.
 
 Crime branch officials said according to the complaint made by the parents of a minor girl, who was then only 14 years — Vaghela had lured her into marriage after eloping with her in the year 2007.
 
 “After being convicted and sentenced to 10 years in jail, Vaghela got out on parole the same year and absconded,” said a crime branch official.
 
 Crime branch officials said that in 2016-17, based on the petition filed by the girl’s parents, the courts had taken a serious view and asked the cops to trace the accused. “The courts had expressed their concern over several warrants going unserved to the accused,” said a senior crime branch official.
 
 Crime branch sources said   Kuldeep Parmar of the SMIU of city crime branch, which became functional in December last year, had taken up the case.
 
 “During primary probe, we found that the accused used to own a tattoo shop. We surmised the accused may have continued with the same business. The SMIU unit then scanned several such tattoo makers and struck upon a profile picture matching that of Vaghela,” said a senior crime branch official.
 
 He added, “We found he was running a tattoo shop in Mumbai. He had also mentioned his phone number in the advertisement, making our job easier to locate him.”
