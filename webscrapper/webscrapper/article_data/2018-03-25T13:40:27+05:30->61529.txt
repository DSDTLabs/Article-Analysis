NAGPUR: Federation of Schools   (FSM), an umbrella group for various school associations, has now taken up the issue of pending RTE reimbursement with the state chief minister Devendra   as no resolution could be reached with the education department. 

 SC  , convener of FSM, said, “It is matter of shame and regret that quality of education has deteriorated and total harmony in school has shattered due to ill-conceived educational policies of state. Due to huge pending RTE bills, private unaided schools are left with no option but to refuse admissions in the free category. It’s not something our members are happy about, but there is simply no other way.”
 
 The e-mail FSM wrote to Fadnavis has also been sent to BJP president Amit Shah and Shiv Sena leaders. Kedia said, “In  , RTE is implemented from STD I but here we have a dual admission policy (nursery and STD I), even though no reimbursement is not given at nursery level.
 
 “ It is propagated that every state should adopt Gujarat Model then why is state not adopting Gujarat Model in education field.” 
 
 FSM also came down hard on the principal secretary for school education Nand Kumar. “Kumar has not held a meeting of stakeholders for last 4 years to understand problems being faced by teachers, parents and schools. He behaves like a dictator which is not permissible in democracy,” said Kedia. 
 
 He alleged that education department officials are “threatening schools” to comply. “Education officers try to intimidate us with derecognition and have created Inspector Raj in Maharashtra, which was never there for educational institutes,” said Kedia.
