HYDERABAD: Work to lay water pipelines may get affected in the city and surrounding municipal circles with   deciding not to give road-cutting permission to Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) during the monsoon. 

 As part of its ‘Urban Mission Bhagiratha’ project, the   has decided to sanction one lakh new connections in GHMC peripheral circles. Till date, it has sanctioned 1,000 connections in 11 GHMC peripheral circles. Of these, pipelines were laid to nearly 800 households while the remaining were in progress. With the GHMC’s decision, the   might get delayed.
 
 The water board has to lay new pipelines from nearby water trunk mains for the project as well as ready 56 service reservoirs. As many as 20 service reservoirs are ready for commissioning. Work on the remaining 36 reservoirs was at a brisk pace and might be completed by September. 
 
 In the GHMC peripheral circles, of the 1,800 km of pipeline, 1,200 km, including inlet and outlet, has been completed. For the remaining 600 km, the work of laying   was completed and road restoration was pending. The water board has to lay 60 km of drinking water trunk mains (600 mm diameter to 1,300 mm diameter). 
 
 The GHMC’s latest decision might affect the distribution network. The Water Board had taken prior permission for laying pipelines in GHMC peripheral circles and also deposited money with the corporation for restoration of roads. “The GHMC has given road-cutting permission to complete patch work of laying pipelines in peripheral circles. Water Board will complete it by May end,” HMWS&SB, officer-on-speical duty (Projects), M A Kabir told  .
 
 “As the water board has completed a major portion of construction of reservoirs and laying of pipelines in GHMC peripherals, we made a plea to permit us to complete the works already grounded,” he said. He said the work on trunk mains and distribution network will be completed by June first week.
