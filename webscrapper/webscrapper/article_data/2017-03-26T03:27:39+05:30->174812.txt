KOLKATA: A three-and-a-half-year-old child was rushed to   with   after he fell from the roof of his 4-storeyed home around 12.40pm on Saturday at Garfa. Though the family members claim the child was alone on the roof at the time of the accident, police couldn't reason out how a small child could climb the high railing on the terrace from where he fell. 

 An employee of a pice hotel on Viveknagar Jheel Road in Garfa, Uttam Halder, rushed to the spot after he heard a loud thud to find Neil Banerjee lying in a pool of blood between the passage of two buildings. Halder immediately stooped a passerby on bike and rushed the child to the hospital. 
 
 When TOI met Halder on Saturday night, he looked restless. " I have been keeping my fingers crossed. It was sheer by luck that I got to hear the thud that made me rush to the spot. When I was taking the child to the hospital, he stopped breathing midway. But I did not give up hope and tried to revive him orally," Halder said. 
 
 "The child's condition is serious with multiple fractures. There might be an internal hemorrhage also. We might need to perform some surgeries and only then we can weigh his chances of survival," a senior official of KPC said.
 
 Neil's father Papan, who owns a garment shop in Jadavpur, was also at the hospital.
 
 A visit to Neil's home revealed neighbours had gathered outside to get a feed from the relations about the child's condition. "We have been praying for his speedy recovery," said Robin Ganguly, a local resident. According to the neighbours, Neil is often seen alone on the roof. "We warned his parents repeatedly but they felt he wouldn't be able to climb on the railing," said Khokon Ghosh, another neighbour.
 
 "We are investigating the matter. It could be an accident or a case of negligence even," an officer of Garfa Police Station said.
