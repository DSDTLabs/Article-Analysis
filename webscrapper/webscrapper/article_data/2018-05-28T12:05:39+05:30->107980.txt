NAGPUR: Cracking the whip, Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co Ltd ( ) regional director, Bhalchandra  , has terminated the services of 25 employees in Vidarbha for habitual absenteeism. Stringent action against nine more employees is in the offing.

 A source in the MSEDCL said that Khandait had issued show-cause notices to 52 employees who frequently remained absent in March. “Most of these employees were posted in small towns and chose to remain at their native places rather than join the duty. Thirty-four employees either did not bother to reply to the notice or submitted unsatisfactory replies,” he added.
 
 Mild action was taken against 12 employees like deducting an increment while six had genuine causes for remaining frequently absent. 
 
 The source further said that one of the sacked employees was from Akola circle, four from   circle, six from   and seven each from Nagpur and   circles. “One of the nine employees against whom action is in final stages is from Akola, one from Chandrapur, two from Amravati and five from Nagpur,” he added.
 
 Khandait has also ordered freezing of house rent allowance (HRA) of employees who do not remain present in their place of work during rainy season. “The number of breakdowns increase during rainy season and consumers are put to severe inconvenience if they are not attended to in time. Last year, we had frozen the HRA of several employees due to which most of them now remain at their place of work. Khandait has asked chief engineers of all five MSEDCL zones in Vidarbha to ensure that employees do not remain absent without leave,” said the source.
 
 The superintending engineers (SEs) of all circles have been asked to act on the directive. The CEs and SEs have been asked to submit a report on absentee employees by Tuesday.
 
 The regional director has also warned that if any employee was found to be casual towards power theft in his area, strict action would be taken against him.
