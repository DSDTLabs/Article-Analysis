VISAKHAPATNAM: The menace of   for furniture and basket making,   is on the rise in north coastal AP.

 Official forest records reveal that bamboo is spread over 1,700 sq km of forest land (reserved, unreserved) and green belts (non-forest area) in the region. In terms of volume, there is roughly 960 million clumps of bamboo. Dendrocalamus Strictus is the most commonly available species of bamboo and a clump weighs on an average 4 to 5 kg. More importantly, bamboo can be harvested every once in three years, which means close to 700 truckloads of yield can be potentially extracted.
 
 “Half what is extracted goes to paper mills in Raigada and Rajahmundry and more than 2,500 metric tonne of bamboo worth nearly Rs 6,000 is smuggled from the forests and sold in the unorganised local markets for various purposes,” said retired forest official   of Vizianagaram district. 
 
 Though cutting and transport permits are required from the revenue and forest departments, much of the illegally smuggled bamboo is being passed off as   ( MFC) collected by tribals, said sources in the forest department. 
 
 P Siva Rao, a contractor who exports bamboo to Rajahmundry paper mills, said, “Even contractors try to maximise output by illegally extracting bamboo from protected areas. They do this mainly to increase profits.”
 
 R  , a farmer from Narsipatnam who has bamboo plantations on 10 acre of land, said, “ I am unable to deal with the permit raj regarding bamboo. I do not understand why I cannot sell my bamboo produce in plains areas without permission.”
