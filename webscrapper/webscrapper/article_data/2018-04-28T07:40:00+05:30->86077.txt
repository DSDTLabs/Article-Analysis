Ferozepur: Five persons were reportedly injured, two of them seriously, after the group was sprayed with bullets at Lohuka Khurd village in Ferozepur district on Wednesday night.

 “Suddenly one of them fired a shot at me after which I called some of my friends for help. On getting information, my friends Jasvir Singh, Ranvir Singh, Saad and Arshdeep Singh rushed to the spot to save me. On reaching there, my opponent fired at them injuring Jasvir and Ranvir seriously,” he alleged.
 
 Meanwhile, some passerby informed the police and the assailants managed to flee from the spot. Jasvir and Ranvir were taken to the civil hospital from where they were first sent to the medical college in Zira, and later to PGIMER, Chandigarh.
