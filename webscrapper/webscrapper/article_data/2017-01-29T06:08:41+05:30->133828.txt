LUCKNOW: Hours after   released its election manifesto on Saturday,   chief   said the saffron party had lost its right to come up with a new manifesto since it did not fulfil its promise made to people during Lok Sabha elections. 

 Mayawati also slammed the BJP for raising the Ram Temple issue saying the saffron parivar promotes fanaticism. “UP is not Gujarat,” she said, while speaking to reporters in Lucknow. “Whether BJP is in power or not, constitutionally it cannot construct the temple...I have complete faith in the court,” she said.
 
 The BSP boss said during Lok Sabha elections BJP made tall   which were later dumped. “They said black money stashed abroad would be brought back. Did they? No,” said the BSP chief. “Now they are setting new time frame....20 days...30 days...40 days...none of it means anything,” she said. Mayawati added that BJP has also failed on its promise to curb corruption by sparing Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya.
 
 Mayawati said it was only her party which kept its promise. “Hum log hawa hawai bataein nahi karte hain... (we mean what we say),“ said the former UP chief minister. Mayawati said her party never released a manifesto yet came to power four times in the past. 
 
 Accusing the BJP of being casteist and anti-Dalit, the BSP chief claimed that in case BJP came to power in UP it would do away with the provision of reservation for Dalits and backward. “People have not forgotten the suicide of Rohith Vemula, flogging of Dalits in Una or the   issue,” she said. 
 
 Slamming BJP for raking up the issue of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari joining the BSP, Mayawati said BJP leadership should first do some introspection. She said both BJP national president (Amit Shah) and UP state president (Keshav Prasad Maurya) have a history of criminal cases. “In logon ka itihaas kisi se chhipa nahi hai... (their history is known to all),” she said.
