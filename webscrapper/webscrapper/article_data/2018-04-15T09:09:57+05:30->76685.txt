GORAKHPUR: Tension prevailed in Gorakhpur’s   village on Saturday after villagers were asked to remove the statues of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar and   because they didn’t have the required permission from the district administration for installing them.

 On Friday evening, residents of Dalit Basti in Pandeypar had put up the statues at the zila panchayat campus.
 
 The next morning, however, they were asked to remove them after police reached the spot, said sources.
 
 “They had put up the statues without any prior permission from the administration. The statues were later removed in the presence of senior officials,” said SSP Shalabh Mathur.
 
 Residents, however, alleged that they had been visiting the sub-divisional magistrate’s office and Gagha police station for the last four to five days in order to obtain necessary permissions but in vain.
 
 “For the last five days, we’ve been making trips to and from the SDM office to the police station to seek permission for installing the statues. We feel helpless now that they have been taken away,” said Rajendra Kumar, a villager.
 
 Meanwhile,   leader Shravan Kumar Nirala alleged that cops removed the statues forcefully.
 
 “It was a big day for us but police and administrative officials took away the statues and dispersed us by force. Cops even threatened to register an FIR against the residents of Dalit Basti if they protest,” he said. “Despite claiming they respect Ambedkar, the   isn’t letting us celebrate his birth anniversary,” he added.
