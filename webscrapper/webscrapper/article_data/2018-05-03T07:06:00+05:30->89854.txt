Ludhiana: Two more people succumbed to burns on Wednesday, taking the toll to seven in LPG cylinder explosion at a house in Giaspura. 

 While 28-year-old Meena Devi, a home-maker, succumbed at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), Ashok Kumar, 45, a labourer, breathed his last at PGI, Chandigarh. 
 
 Both Meena Devi and Ashok Kumar, residents of Giaspura, had rushed to Ashok Yadav and Sunita’s house after gas cylinder leak triggered panic on April 26. 
 
 Meena Devi’s mother-in-law Aganya Devi and sister-in-law Anjum Devi, too, had accompanied her. When they reached Ashok Yadav’s house, the cylinder exploded, leaving 34 injured. 
 
 Aganya Devi and Anjum Devi are undergoing treatment at DMCH, where their condition is stated to be critical. 
 
 An inconsolable Kamlesh Kumar, husband of Meena Devi who works as a guard at a factory, said, “Meena had gone to help Ashok Yadav and Sunita on hearing their cries. She took along some sand to douse the flames. But the cylinder exploded, leaving her with critical burns. My mother and sister-in-law were also injured. My five kids are in a state of shock.” 
 
 The other victim, Ashok Kumar, was referred to PGI as his condition was serious. “He was seeking government help for his treatment,” said a kin. He is survived by wife Parvati and two children.
 
 Besides Meena Devi and Ashok Kumar, the blast had claimed the lives of house owner Sunita, her son Raj, neighbours Ram Naresh, Shashi and Amarnath.
