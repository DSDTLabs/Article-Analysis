PUNE:   Board (KTB) said that it has tied-up with local IPL franchise   (RPS) as “associate sponsors” to reach out to Indian travellers.

 “KTB has embarked on this association considering the influence of the sport, especially cricket and its popularity, to drive awareness and consideration for Kenya, as a preferred holiday destination,” the board said in a statement.
 
 About 64,000 Indians travelled to Kenya in 2016 and the country hopes to draw 1,00,000 tourists by 2018.
 
 “KTB wanted to reach out on pan-India basis to each and every Indian, looking for a holiday option that is, full of nature's delight, culture, heritage and unique unmatched experiences," the statement said.
 
 "Kenya is a destination, for family bonding, honeymooners, corporate team building, golfing and other soft adventures. Be it   or the turquoise blue waters with white sandy beaches or the Mt. Kenya region, Kenya with its average climate (ranging from 20 to 28 degree celsius) throughout the year, is a fascinating destination on the equator,” the statement added.
 
 KTB said that along with RPS it will rollout joint initiatives for advertising, promotions and other communication platforms through various mediums, to engage with cricketing fans across India.
