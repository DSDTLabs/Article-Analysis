GANDHINAGAR: The Union cabinet has approved setting up of a new commission for backward classes as a constitutional body. The National Commission for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes ( ) will now replace the National Commission for Backward Classes ( ).

  Prime Minister   chaired a cabinet meeting on Wednesday and approved amending the Constitution and inserting Article 338B for setting up the new commission.
 
 Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) convener,   said that he needs more clarification from the government about the new commission, and will ask the government to prove that it’s not just election propaganda.
 
 Hardik said, “I welcome government of India’s move to set up the National Commission for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (NSEBC) Commission to replace the OBC commission. However, the move seems to be politically motivated and election oriented.”
 
 “The government of India must express it’s clear intention. It has talked about amending the Constitution for the new commission, so it must clarify how and when it will be done,” Hardik said, adding, “Will it be aimed at including Patidars and other communities who are demanding reservation or not? The Gujarat government also needs to express its views.’’
 
 Shankersinh Vaghela, leader of opposition (LOP) in the state assembly and senior Congress leader said, “It’s a political move keeping only the Gujarat polls in mind, and to woo the reservation-seeking Patidar community in the state.
