BENGALURU: Even as you read this, a car resale deal could be going on through a classified portal. Except, the car doesn’t exist and the dealer is a fake. Though he will insist that its at the   parking lot.

 Online fraudsters are using ingenious methods to con innocents, and the vehicle resale cum Bengaluru airport parking fee scam is one such.
 
 Doing the rounds in garden city for over four years now, the scam has victimized over a thousand Bengalureans who have individually lost from Rs 10,000 to as much as Rs 2.50 lakh through online transfers, after being lured into purchasing a second hand vehicle through classifieds portals olx.in and quikr.com.
 
 Last year, over 30 complaints were received at the CID Cybercrime police station inside the Commissionerate alone, and close to 50 more victims approached the Cybercrime station at the state CID headquarters.
 
 In mid-2016, IT professional Naveen Kumar (name changed on request) settled in Koramangala after relocating from Kochi when he got a lucrative job here. Life was good for the 26-year-old who decided to pep it up by adding a sedan to commute. “I logged on to quikr and thought I found the best deal when I spotted an ad for a 2014 model Honda City VX diesel for just Rs 6 lakh,” recalled the youngster, whose ordeal began after he contacted the seller.
 
 “The man, who had an African accent, told me that he had left Bengaluru for the US suddenly on work after parking the car at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) and the vehicle has been there for a few weeks, accumulating a fat parking fee. He asked me to pay the fee which would be deducted from final sale amount for the car,” Kumar added.
 
 Lured by the cheap deal, the techie initially deposited Rs 20,000 into a bank account which the fraudster said was the KIA’s online parking fee payment scheme. In a series of deposits that followed in three months, Kumar lost nearly Rs 2.15 lakh, and realized it was a scam after the fraudster turned incommunicado. Kumar rushed to KIA’s parking area to realize there was no such sedan. He approached Cyber Cell CID sleuths who are probing numerous such cases.
 
 Similarly, city-based businessman Rajkumar lodged a complaint with   police station last October after losing Rs 1.30 lakh to the scamsters after he attempted to purchase a 2012 model Tempo Traveller advertised on olx.in for just Rs 3.5 lakh.
 
 In June 2015, the Chickpet and Kodigehalli police busted a gang each after culprits siphoned off lakhs of rupees from victims online, through the car parking fee fraud. Six Nigerian nationals, including a woman who posed as a Customs official from KIA and orchestrated the fraud with her accomplices, were caught red-handed by Chickpet sleuths. However, this hasn’t deterred fraudsters with the suspicion that multiple gangs are operating in Bengaluru, luring innocents into parting with their money, enticed by car sale ads online.
 
 “Preliminary investigations have established that these scamsters, who were suspected to be mainly African nationals illegally residing in Bengaluru, visit genuine used four-wheeler sellers. On the pretext of taking it for a test ride, they take photographs of the car from various angles, after fixing fake registration plates they carry. They then post the car on olx.in and quikr.com and start cheating people,” a CID investigating officer explained the modus operandi. In some cases, victims have received forged airport parking receipts with pending amounts from fraudsters to validate their scam, police sources said.
