NEW DELHI: NIA on Thursday filed chargesheet against 26/11 Mumbai attacks mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba chief  ,   Mujahideen head Syed Salahuddin, seven separatists and two persons who led stone-pelting mobs in the Kashmir Valley, accusing them of funding and carrying out terror attacks and violence besides subversive activities on the directions of their "Pakistani handlers". 

  Without naming them as accused in the chargesheet, NIA has also termed some senior Hurriyat leaders - Syed Ali Shah  , Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Asiya Andrabi, Yasin Malik and Shabbir Shah - as the "main organisers" of subversive activities in Kashmir, sources said. 
 
  Probe against the five Hurriyat leaders is continuing and their names would be added in the supplementary chargesheet, sources said. However, Geelani's son-in-law, Altaf Ahmad Shah 'Funtoosh', is among those named in the chargesheet. 
 
  In its 12,794- page chargesheet, NIA has cited as 'crucial evidence' like video recordings of Saeed and Salahuddin's speeches instigating youths in Kashmir to take up arms, indulge in stone pelting and support the separatist leaders; and letters written by LeT and Hizbul terrorists to Geelani and others. 
 
 The agency has provided documentary and electronic evidence to establish links between senior Hurriyat leaders, UN-lis-ted terrorists - Saeed and Salahuddin- and Pakistani embassy officials in Delhi, who allegedly provided funds for anti-India activities.
