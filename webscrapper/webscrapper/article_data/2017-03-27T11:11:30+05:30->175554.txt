Rajkot: A woman conductor of   (GSRTC) bus was badly assaulted by a passenger in the Rajkot-Jasdan bus on Saturday night. 

 The accused passenger, whose name is not known yet, pulled the conductor   (22) by her hair and smashed her face on the iron rod of the bus after an altercation, police said. Kukadiya, a native of Hingolgadh village in   taluka, suffered injuries on her face and broke her tooth. 
 
 According to details of the incident, the male passenger boarded the packed bus at   circle on 80-feet Road in the city. Kukadiya requested him to give her some space to reach the rear end of bus so that she could give tickets to the passengers. This made the man angry and he entered into an argument with her. 
 
 In the meantime, he even called up a staffer named Dinesh at the Jasdan bus depot and complained to him. Dinesh then called up the bus driver to inquire about the matter. The issue was settled after the driver had a talk with the passenger. 
 
 However, when the bus approached Halenda village at around 9:15pm, the passenger purposely went near Kukadiya and brushed his leg against her. He then pulled her by her hair and smashed her face on the rod and alighted at the bus stop. He even threatened to kill her, police said.
 
 The bus driver then inquired about the passenger from Dinesh, the staffers whom he had called earlier. He gave the passengerâ€™s mobile number as 9662376668. Based on this, Kukadiya lodged a complaint with Aji Dam police station in Rajkot. 
 
 Police have booked the passenger for obstructing a government employee from performing her duty as well as for criminal intimidation.
