MUMBAI: People from across the country have generously come forward to help fund the treatment of Dadaji  , a self-trained plant breeder who had revolutionised paddy farming with his high-yielding variety known as HMT. 

 
 Khobragade had suffered a paralytic stroke in 2015 and his health started deteriorating a few months ago. Although he is in urgent need of hospitalisation, his family was unable organise the funds. They had appealed to the public 25 days ago for Rs 2 lakh and a crowdfunding campaign was launched, which managed to collect Rs 1.2 lakh till Monday. TOI then published a report about Khobragade’s hardships. On Tuesday, Rs 3.3 lakh more poured in a day. 
 
 Khobragade, who hails from Nanded village in Maharashtra’s   district, is a recipient of over 100 awards. He had dropped out of school after   to help his family on the farm. In 1982-83, he noticed three yellow-seeded paddy spikes in his field, picked them, and stored them for use the following year. 
 
 He sowed this yellow variety separately and realised that its yield was much higher. “Subsequently, my father gave the seeds to other villagers. Their yields tripled and he became famous,” said Mitrajit, Khobragade’s son. 
 
 Since the name of the variety was not known, some of Khobragade’s friends decided to call it HMT, after the brand of wristwatch that he wore. 
 
 Although he got recognition for his work, Khobragade could not monetise his seed innovations. In 1997-98, Khobragade alleged that   (PKV), an Akola-based university, was commercialising his variety under name PKV HMT rice. The varsity claimed it had “purified” his variety.
