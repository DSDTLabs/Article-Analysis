Mysuru: A temple that was illegally constructed beneath high-tension electric lines at Rajendranagar was demolished by authorities of the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) on Sunday. Acting on directives from the court, MCC officials from Zone 8 razed the Sri Rajarajeshwari temple, which had been constructed on a vacant plot without seeking administrative approval from the competent authorities.

 The demolition process started around 4.30am. An official from MCC told TOI that the priest had been informed about the demolition, and been told to shift the idol from the temple’s sanctum sanctorum. “The residents, who arrived at the site before the demolition process started, shifted the idol to a nearby temple, where it was established amid rituals and pujas. We proceeded to demolish the structure only after that,” the official added.
 
 Five years ago, Narayana, a Rajendranagar resident and employee of Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation employee, registered a complaint when he lost his 10-year-old son was electrocuted to death on coming to contact with a live wire when arrangements were being made for a ceremony at the temple. Narayana subsequently moved court demanding justice, and named the MCC, the housing board and the temple as parties.
 
 However, when the court ordered the temple’s demolition, there was confusion over which department the land belonged to – the housing board or the MCC – leading to a delay in carrying out the court’s directive. Narayana subsequently approached the court again. The court then ordered the MCC to carry out the demolition. “We followed the court’s order, and demolished the temple,” the MCC official added.
