CUTTACK: Buses will ply as usual in CDA locality. A division bench of the Orissa High Court on Thursday set aside last year's order of a single-bench judge, putting a ban on bus services in the residential areas of the CDA. Hearing a petition alleging that city buses plying in CDA residential areas were creating nuisance, the single-bench of Justice  , in June 2016, had ordered a ban on movement of buses in the locality.

 Due to the order, residents of CDA were facing lot of problem in commuting. They had to travel to Ring Road to avail the bus facility. The order had hit the office goers badly, said sources. The Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) had filed a plea challenging the order of the single-judge bench. "We pleaded before the division bench of Chief Justice Vineet Saran and Justice B R Sarangi that restriction on bus services in CDA locality was unwarranted as the petition had never prayed for a ban. The bench heard our plea and set aside the order of the single-judge bench," said counsel of CMC Jaydip Pal. 
 
 The bus service was launched by   and   under   National Urban Renewal Mission in May 2011. At least 30 buses were plying from CDA to Bhubaneswar while 20 buses were operating from Cuttack to Banki and Choudwar via CDA. Even Markat Nagar Residents' Association had filed a plea in the high court, seeking quashing of the single-judge bench order.
