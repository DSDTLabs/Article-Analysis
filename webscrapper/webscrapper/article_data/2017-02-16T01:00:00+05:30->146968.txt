Back and neck pain is one of the most common reasons cited for sick leaves at a  . Statistics also state that around 50 per cent of the working population suffer from this ailment at least once in a year. Senior spine consultant Dr  , spine specialist Dr  , and clinical nutritionist   share tips to deal with this. 

 
 
 Doctors say that using chairs that have a fixed back support and an inclination between 90 to 110 degrees are good. One must sit on a chair that has proper back support with hips all the way behind and legs supported flat on the floor. This will ensure that pressure is distributed equally throughout the spine. 
 
 
 
 Sitting on stiff-backed chairs, bean bags, or on sofas that are too soft, could lead to back problems. Avoid sitting on the floor with your back unsupported — especially if your jeans/trousers are too tight. 
 
 
 
 If you want to pick up anything, you must bend your knees, get the object closer to your body, and then lift it. Bending one’s knees when lifting 
 anything helps to reduce the stress on your spine. 
 
 
 
 Keep things at just an elbow-width apart. This prevents you from reaching out and stretching unnecessarily. 
 
 
 
 You should adjust the straps to make sure that it does not sag down to your hips. This creates a lot of pressure on the shoulder and back. Carrying 
 backpacks on one side is also a bad idea. The right way to carry the backpack is to carry it close to your back.
 
 
 
 The root cause for back and neck pain are weak spinal muscles. It is good to do a few stretching exercises while sitting at your desk. Take frequent breaks from constant desktop work to exercise your spinal muscles. Gym-goers should always begin their workout with warm up exercises and end with cool down exercises. Care should be given to your back before lifting any weights. Don’t do high-end activities with a weak core.
