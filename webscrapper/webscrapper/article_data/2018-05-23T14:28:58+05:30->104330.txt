LONDON: A Goan man accused of trying to meet two 12-year-old girls who he had ‘sexually groomed’ has pleaded not guilty to the offence.

 
  Pereira, 30, who lives in Southall and works as a warehouse operative at Heathrow, made his first appearance at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday. He was accompanied by his uncle and another Indian man and woman. The latter, the court was told, was a “family friend” who would translate for him as he “spoke Portuguese”.
 
 Pereira, who hails from Panaji, told the court his nationality was Portuguese, and confirmed his address and date of birth.
 
 The court heard that on December 29, 2017, in the Borough of Ealing, Pereira had attempted to meet two girls aged under 16 following ‘sexual grooming’ knowing the girls were minors.
 
 Dressed in a black-hooded top, dark blue jeans, and black and white trainers, he looked solemn as the charges were read out to him, and confidently said, “Not guilty.”
 
 The court clerk attempted to put reporting restrictions on the identity of the girls, but was informed by prosecutor   that “there were no 12-year-olds” as it was a vigilante case whereby two adults from an online vigilante group had chatted with Pereira online pretending to be 12-year-old girls. Pereira had then arranged to meet them, intending to commit an offence. She said that Pereira turned up to meet them, but the girls did not exist and instead the police were called and he was arrested.
 
 Deputy district judge Shlomo Kreiman asked whether there was a “long history “of chatting with the girls. Pereira’s lawyer said the online conversation with the girls lasted “20 days max”.
 
 Kreiman said the matter was “too serious to be dealt with” at magistrates’ court, and sent it to crown court for a jury trial. Pereira was given unconditional bail and will reappear at   on June 19.
 
 Online vigilante groups are volunteers who set up sting operations to expose people who they claim are potential child sex offenders.
