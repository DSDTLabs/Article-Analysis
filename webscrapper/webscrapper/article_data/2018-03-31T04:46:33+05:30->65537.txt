GHAZIABAD: High drama ensued on Friday morning at   ground just a few hours before chief minister   was to address a public rally. The police seized a bundle of ‘fake’   from the members of All School Parents Association who wanted to hand over a memorandum over   to the chief minister. Police officials claimed that the aim of the association was to disrupt the CM’s function.

 Additional superintendent of police (control Room) Manish Kumar Mishra said, “We had received information that some people were trying to enter the VVIP enclosure with fake passes. We conducted an inspection and seized passes from ASPA members which did not have any names on it. They claimed that it was given to them by some party functionaries. We are conducting an inquiry into it.”
 
 “One of their members, a woman, was distributing passes sitting inside the venue. She herself did not have a valid pass with her. Hundreds of such passes were with them, but the police managed to recover around 30 from her. The members were not able to give a valid explanation about. 
 
 “They were removed from the venue. Later, we took the memorandum which they wanted to give to the CM,” Mishra added.
 
 The ASPA denied the charges and said police officials instead manhandled women members. 
 
 ASPA president Shivani Jain said, “Our intention was not to create any ruckus at the venue. We wanted to give a memorandum to the chief minister. We had reached the venue around 10.30 am. I was given passes by a local BJP councillor. No doubt, they were blank and when pointed out, we immediately mentioned the name. However, police officials were quite rude and pushed me and other members around. We were later kept inside an enclosure till 1.30 pm and guarded by police so that we could not meet the CM.”
