JAIPUR: Calling BJP’s defeat in bypolls a result of ruling party’s disregard for Rajput sentiments, several Rajput outfits gathered at   to celebrate the Congress party’s victory in Ajmer, Alwar and Mandalgarh on Thursday.

 Rajput outfits, including  , claimed that the BJP government betrayed the community on the issue of Padmaavat and Anandpal case which led to its massive defeat.
 
 “For the last 40 years, Rajputs have been voting for BJP. But the party didn’t recognise our contribution,” said Giriraj Singh Lotwara, president, Shree Rajput Sabha.
 
 He accused BJP of sidelining Rajput stalwarts like   and Jaswant Singh. “The party never respected the sentiments of our community which supported it for a very long time,” he said, adding that all communities supported Rajputs’ call for defeating the BJP.
 
 Shree Rajput Karni Sena president Mahipal Singh Makrana said the BJP was hand-in-glove with the makers of Padmaavat movie and did everything to get it released. “If BJP doesn’t mend its ways, then rest assured that it will face a rout in coming assembly and general elections,” Makrana said.
