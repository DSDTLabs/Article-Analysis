PANAJI: While stating that the air quality index (AQI) has significantly improved in the   belt post 2012, the   (GSPCB) report recommended the prohibition of iron ore transportation during busy hours, as recommended by the Indian School of Mines (ISM), Dhanbad, to maintain the current AQI. 

 The board had recently conducted ambient air monitoring in mining areas to ascertain AQI. Its report has been published in the   souvenir.
 
 When mining was on, the AQI in the study area was found to be moderatein the range of 101 to 200as per norms laid down by the  . The AQI after mining operations ceased was found to be satisfactory in the non-monsoon season and good in the monsoon season.
 
 “Mining operations restarted in 2015-16 with a cap of 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA). To ensure the AQI is maintained, the effective management plan, as recommended by ISM, Dhanbad, with strict enforcement of load limit and vehicle speed should be ensured. Similarly, transportation of ore should be prohibited during busy hours, as recommended,” the GSPCB report stated.
 
 Sources said the board collects air quality data twice a week from different locations in the mining belt to check the AQI. The report was prepared based on the data collected from mining areas such as Curchorem, Bicholim, Assonora and Honda.
 
 Recently, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change sought comments from state and central departments over increasing the ore extraction cap in the state to 37 MTPA as per the report prepared by the six-member expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court.
