KOLKATA: Supply syndicates have nearly written the epitaph of legitimate stores across Kolkata. Some of them have diversified into the hardware business to survive while the rest are on the brink of closure. 

 Mantu Halder, a businessman who inherited the construction materials shop on Hazra Road, recalled the situation was very different till the mid-80s when stores like theirs were free to bid for projects and even government orders.
 
 “We used to supply building materials to Lansdowne and Ballygunge. We have even supplied to the PWD. But everything changed around 1985. A nexus of politicians, police and musclemen seized the market. Developers were told to procure only from them. Those that defied were met with bullets,” he said. 
 
 With syndicates cornering the supply to all major construction activities, it was only small amounts required for odd repairs and maintenance of existing houses that shops like that of Halder were left with. The ill-stocked godown reflects the poor state of his business. “Now we supply cement sand or stone chips in hand-pulled carts. Earlier, we used to supply in trucks. If we try to do so now, it will mean confronting bullets. We are resigned to fate,” said Halder, who has begun stocking paints to keep the shop afloat. 
 
 Sukumar Bose, who owns   on Puddapukur Road, felt the heat after a supply   started spreading tentacles. The situation has deteriorated in the recent years. “It is increasingly becoming difficult for us to run the business. Our business is on the verge of closure,” Bose said.
 
 Pratap Nayak, owner of — Assembly Building & Hardware Store, has been supplying to the illustrious Bose family for generations. It was Nayak who supplied materials for the repair at 90 Sarat Bose Road. “If the syndicate now force residents to purchase materials required for small repairs from them, then legitimate shops will have to down shutters,” he said.
