AHMEDABAD:   students have bagged all the three prizes in the design category at the 11th Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers’ Design and Styling conclave, held in Goa on February 17. Swapneel Desai took the top prize, Freny Antony was the first runner-up, and Anand ES was the second runner-up. “I have designed an autonomous car which will shrink when it passes through narrow lanes,” Desai said. “It will expand on wider roads. The innovation has been inspired by travel bags which can be made big or small with the use of zippers.” The car will have the capability of self-assembling and will run on electricity, Desai said.

  Antony, who also made a  , said that such vehicles will be the need of the hour by 2030. “I have designed a car for children aged between five and 10 years which will have auto sensors to scan the roads,” Antony said. “The GPS will take the car to the destination. Initially, people may be apprehensive of driverless cars. But at present, most accidents happen due to human errors.” Anand, who has nicknamed his newly created car ‘Boeing 107’, said that his autonomous car will have facilities like a massager, helping the driver relax while travelling for eight to nine hours.
