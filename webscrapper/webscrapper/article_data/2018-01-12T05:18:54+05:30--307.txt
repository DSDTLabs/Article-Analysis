American indie rock band   have released 'Dead Alive (Flipped)', a more sober and serious take on the original version. It is also the latest track from their forthcoming album 'The Worms Heart'.

 "The original version of 'Dead Alive' was right in the wheel house with tracks we had done before. It has the same triplet galloping rhythm as a number of Shins songs,"  , the artiste responsible for the vocals and guitar of the band, said in a statement. 
 
 "So to 'flip' it, we broke it down into more romantic elements like that dark piano and  's violin, which I love. That's me in the beginning knocking my beer off the console while mic-ing her! Oops! Listen for  's sick fuzzed out solo," he added.
 
 When James Mercer wrote, produced, and recorded the album 'Heartworms', he had a desire for an alternate version, an opposite version. The original track order is reversed and songs are reborn, yet the lyrics and melody remain intact. 
 
 'The Fear' is transformed from tender lament into a growling garage rock cut, while 'Heartworms' is given a disco makeover with Moroder-style synths, and the track 'Half a million' is reworked into a reggae and rocksteady-tinged reboot.
 
 The complete rework of The Shins' 2017 album 'Heartworms' will be released on January 19.
