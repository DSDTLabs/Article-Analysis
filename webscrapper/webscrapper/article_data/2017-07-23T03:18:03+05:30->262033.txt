KOLKATA: Hoardings put up on roads, flags selling at a premium, cafes and restaurants decorating themselves in Tricolour and clubs hiring projectors — Kolkata never went this crazy ahead of any women’s   match till date. But with the Indian team making it to the Women’s World Cup final, the sports-loving city is in no mood to let the opportunity go.

 “This is the moment for which we had waited for our lifetime. The day has finally come when people are talking about the women’s game everywhere. I am so proud as well as thankful to Mithali Raj and the rest of the team for finally making people acknowledge our game,” said Subhra Bhaduri, the head coach of all-girl Rising Star   Club at Vivekananda Park. For Sunday, Bhaduri has tweaked her coaching timings and has called all the trainees at noon. He will wrap up the training by 2.30pm. “We have set up a giant screen inside our academy. We will watch the match together after the training,” said Bhaduri.
 
 Several housing complexes and clubs have also ordered for projectors to screen the match live. At South City, the residents’ association has organized a live screening at the complex cafeteria. “We do screen matches on giant screen during men’s cricket and football World Cups. Then why not for girls?” asked  , a South City resident. Cafes like Wabi Sabi on Southern Avenue will offer special discounts from 2.30pm.
 
 At Amra Sabai Club in Beliaghata, Bandhab Sangha in Behala and Deshbandhu Club in  , the organisers are planning to hire projectors to watch the match. Then there are fans like Sourav Basu, Anju Agarwal and Ritwik Chakraborty, who have cancelled all other plans for Sunday evening. “This is a family moment. This team has even turned my 67-year-old mother into a cricket fan. I just hope this Sunday our girls can do what our boys had failed in the Champions Trophy,” said Chakraborty, a software engineer.
