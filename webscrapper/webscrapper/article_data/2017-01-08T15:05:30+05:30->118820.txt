NEW DELHI: Whether it is a part of the non-cooperation drive initiated by the ousted members of BCCI or not is tough to say, but the   ( ) has taken a blatant stand of not hosting two Test matches between India and England under-19 teams in Chennai. 

 In a letter written to BCCI, TNCA gave the reason of "various domestic programs scheduled during the period" for not hosting the Tests.
 
 "At the outset we thank you for allowing the India-England Under-19 matches at Chennai. However, we regret to inform you that we are unable to host the matches in Chennai due to various domestic programs scheduled during the period," the TNCA official wrote.
 
 The board made suitable arrangement for the Tests, but it didn't go down well with the  . Sources said that the letter-head addressed in the name of former BCCI boss   as the TNCA president is equivalent to a contempt of Supreme Court order.
 
 "From the day the apex court passed the order, the officials of both TNCA and BCCI are removed from their posts. They don't need to resign from their posts. And if someone is still using the same letter head, it's not correct," a source close to the Lodha committee told TOI.
 
 Interestingly, TNCA isn't reading too much into the accusation. It is after all the prerogative of the state unit whether to stage the match or not. "This kind of incident has not happened so frequently in the past. The TNCA have prior commitments and there is no need to talk about anything else," a source close to the association added.
