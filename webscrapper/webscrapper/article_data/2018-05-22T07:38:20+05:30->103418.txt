KOCHI: Inclusion is the need of the hour and the caste system that is existing now is against the views of Hindu philosophers like Adi Shankaracharya and Ramanuja, said   M   in Kalady on Monday. 

  “Sankaracharya’s message was that of inclusion. We should not exclude and deny opportunities to anybody,” said Naidu.
 
 He was speaking at the award ceremony of competitive science and innovation contest at Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering Technology. “Unfortunately, even after so many years of civilization and independence we hear stories of untouchability, where someone is not allowed to enter a temple or area of work. It is all nonsense. The Hindu philosophy has never allowed this,” said Naidu, while speaking to young audience at the college.
 
 “Indian history is replete with a number of scientists, mathematicians, physicians, chemists, metallurgists, surgeons, astronomers and a number of innovators who have significantly advanced human knowledge. One recalls a number of such illustrious names like Aryabhata, Pingala, Brahmagupta, Bhaskara, Varahamihira, Charaka and Sushrutha. India gave the concept of ‘zero’ and the ‘binary system’ to the world. Our ancient surgeons could conduct many complicated surgeries including plastic surgery and cataract surgery,” he said.
 
 The winner of the contest for students from Class VIII - XII was Government Higher Secondary School Kaniyambetta. The second prize went to students of SMV Higher Secondary school and third place went to Government Higher Secondary School for Girls, Cotton Hill, Thiruvananthapuram.
