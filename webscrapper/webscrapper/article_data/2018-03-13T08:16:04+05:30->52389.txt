NEW DELHI: In a blow to  , Naresh Agarwal, a confidant of the Yadavs, joined   on Monday, but immediately embarrassed his host with a “sexist” comment about   MP Jaya Bachchan. “I was equated with those working in films... I was rejected for those who dance in films, work in films. I found it improper,” he said. While BJP distanced itself from the comment, the storm on social media prompted foreign minister   to tweet, “Shri   is welcome. However, his comments regarding   are improper and unacceptable.”

 The former SP MP was perhaps aiming his guns at Mulayam Singh Yadav for nominating Bachchan but ended up embarrassing BJP. Agarwal said his son Nitin, an MLA from Hardoi, will vote for BJP in the Rajya Sabha polls. BJP has fielded 11 candidates although it has numbers to win only eight in UP. The party is pinning hopes on Agarwal managing MLAs from other parties for the ninth candidate Anil Aggarwal as the party has only 28 excess votes and is still short of nine as 37 MLAs elect one RS MP in UP.
 
 Agarwal, who has a vocal critic of the Modi government and BJP in Rajya Sabha, lauded the PM and BJP chief Amit Shah and said the BJP’s growing popularity prompted him to join the party. He was earlier with the Akhil Bharatiya Loktantrik Congress with Jagdambika Pal, Rajeev Shukla and Shyam Sunder Sharma that allied with the BJP government headed by Kalyan Singh in UP in 1997.
 
 His remarks about Lord Ram had led to a major controversy, including disruption of Parliament by BJP MPs who demanded an apology from Agarwal.
 
 Despite having been in Congress, SP and BSP at various times, Agarwal said joining BJP was a “homecoming” and that he would do whatever the party assigned. “I have not joined BJP for any Rajya Sabha ticket, nor have I set any condition,” he said.
