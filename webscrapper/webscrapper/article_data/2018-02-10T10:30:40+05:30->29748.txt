SECUNDERABAD: The   (SCR) has suspended eight   ( ) passenger services for over a month at   for apron work.

 The services that have been terminated temporarily from February 11 to March 21 are between Secunderabad to Medchal, Bolarum, and Manoharabad.
 
 A traffic block has been imposed to lay   apron on platform no 7 of Secunderabad station and this prompted SCR to cancel DEMU services.
 
 The washable apron, which is used to maintain cleanliness, is part of the railway track along the platform. It is a concrete bed along the tracks at stations so that water jets can be used properly to flush out wastes from the toilets of parked trains.
 
 However, a railway spokesperson told TOI that the floors of tracks at all the 10 platforms of Secunderabad station had been cemented fiveyears ago. “The ongoing apron works on platform no 7 is nothing but repairing the cementing done earlier.
 
 Now, we are monitoring cleanliness at railway platforms as per the board’s emphasis. In this regard, washable aprons play a vital role as it helps staff to remove waste from the tracks,” said the spokesperson. In the zone, all important stations have been equipped with the washable aprons.
 
 However, the cancellation of DEMU services may cause inconvenience to passengers as SCR will not run alternative trains to the respective destinations. Railway authorities are unable to run these services from other platforms in the station. The spokesperson said, “Other platforms remain occupied when these trains are scheduled. We have cancelled the trains carrying less passengers. The apron work will give commuters respite from the stench emanating from tracks. We hope they will bear with us for the inconvenience.”
