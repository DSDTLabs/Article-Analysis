KOLKATA: A day after he died after a   at  , cops on Monday have identified the victim as   (57). His family was informed about the incident.

 Police maintained that the initial postmortem report indicates he committed suicide. A resident of Rohini in southwest Delhi, he had lately been living alone on Swinhoe Street in Gariahat.
 
  “We have learnt he was employed in a senior position at Parcon India at Beckbagan’s Business Tower Building,” said an officer. 
 
 DC (southeast) Gaurav Sharma said they have studied CCTV footages at the mall and spoken to security guards. “He entered the mall alone. He was last seen walking to the parking lot where he lit a cigarette. Nobody seems to have noticed him after that,” said an officer.
 
 Sources said that the victim was depressed after his wife separated from him. His children — a son and a daughter — both stay in Mumbai. Neighbours said he had, of late, taken to alcohol and was having problems at work too. Puri was also facing financial problems, said sources. Officers are speaking to close relatives to find out if he was depressed and if he had tried to commit suicide earlier.
 
 “We are still trying to ascertain the exact reason for his suicide, but it seems that his acute financial crunch forced him into becoming an alcoholic and eventually led his wife to separate from him,” said an officer.
 
  Police sources, though, wondered how the victim climbed up to take the jump despite presence of security personnel.
 
 The police are trying to ascertain which floor he fell from. They are also checking the   and witnesses. Mall officials, however, remained tight-lipped about the incident.
