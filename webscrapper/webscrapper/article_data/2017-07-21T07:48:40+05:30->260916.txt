LUCKNOW: Violating a   (NGT) order which makes it mandatory for all states to have   in every town, more than 95% of towns in UP have no such arrangement. Of UP’s 652 towns, only 32 have waste management projects. The worst part is they are functional in only 10 big towns such as Lucknow, Allahabad, Varanasi and Aligarh. 

 NGT orders are for all urban local bodies to ensure that the Municipal   (Management and Handling) Rules 2016 are followed in all towns. The rules state that every town should have a dedicated processing plant and sanitary landfill site. In November 2016, NGT had asked for a status report and solutions from urban local bodies of all states.
 
 UP’s Urban Local Bodies Directorate had written to the NGT in February that the waste management plant is functional only in 10 towns and lying unused in 22. The remaining 620 towns don’t have a waste management set-up at all. As a solution, it suggested that since land availability is a big problem for maintaining sanitary landfill, UP may adopt cluster-based projects. 
 
 An official privy to the development said, “The government is planning to adopt cluster-based waste management   in which all towns within 50km periphery can use a common landfill site for   waste for years. Each of them must have a dedicated waste treatment plant. We are in the process of identifying land for creating landfills.”
 
 The department has sought help from district administrations to scout for such land and provide it for free to urban local bodies. The directorate is planning to create 33 such clusters in the state to cover all 652 towns under waste management rules. Though the waste would be treated within the town, the residual waste would be carried to the landfill site.
