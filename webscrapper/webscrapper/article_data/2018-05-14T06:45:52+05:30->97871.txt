KOCHI: A person cannot be accused as a terrorist only because he watches videos related to terrorism, the high court observed in a judgment recently. Many such videos are available in the public domain, the court pointed out. 

 A division bench comprising Justice A M Shaffique and Justice P Somarajan said in the judgment, "As far as the appellant is concerned, he is detained on the ground that he might have involved in terrorism. The fact that he has seen certain videos and speeches as aforesaid by itself will not be a reason to implicate him as a terrorist, unless there are other materials to establish the same. Many of such videos, speeches, etc are in public domain..."
 
 The court's observation came on a petition seeking bail filed by 26-year-old Muhammed Riyas of New Mahe, who is facing an   investigation in a 'love jihad' case in which the woman has alleged that he lured her, converted her to Islam, and tried to take her to Syria to join the IS.
 
 The NIA probe team got two laptops containing literature, videos and speeches related to Zakir Naik and jihad organizations, and also videos of the war in Syria. As of now, no other terror links have been established, NIA's counsel M Ajay submitted.
 
 Advocate   argued that the petitioner is not at all involved in any terrorist organization and allegations have been raised against him by the woman on account of the matrimonial dispute or under the influence of some other persons. The petitioner is being unnecessarily detained in prison and he will get bail only after 180 days as   has been invoked, the counsel submitted.
 
 Setting aside an order by the NIA special court denying bail, the high court said it is granting bail as no materials are forthcoming even after 70 days of imprisonment of the petitioner.
