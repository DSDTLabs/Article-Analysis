JAIPUR: A 32-year-old woman was   by her   in Rajsamand when she refused to sign the papers that the latter gave her. 

 The incident took place on Saturday when the accused, identified as   Joshi, entered the house where his estranged wife Sharda lived. “Due to their problems they were living separately. Shailash came armed with a sharp-edged weapon and asked Sharda to sign some papers. When she resisted Shailash attacked him and managed to flee from the house,” said a senior police officer on Sunday. 
 
 On hearing Sharda’s cries, the neighbours rushed to the house and took her to the hospital. “She was bleeding profusely. She had been stabbed in the lower abdominal area. She succumbed to the injuries in the hospital,” the officer added. 
 
 Police have registered a case of murder against the accused and efforts were on to nab him. “There are unconfirmed reports that the accused Shailash came to get the divorce papers signed. Since Sharda was living with another man, Shailash wanted divorce. However, Sharda refused to sign the papers,” said an officer.
