BENGALURU: The Dr   (BASE) should open its doors to students from across the world, President   said on Friday.

 “The objective of the institution should not be limited to benefiting local students. It should be a global institute of excellence like Nalanda and Takshashila,” the President said after laying the foundation stone for BASE.
 
 Anup K Pujari, director of BASE, said the government will look into the suggestion. Through a government order (GO) issued in 2014, the state has reserved 30% seats in BASE for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students. “The government will deliberate on the President’s advice,” said Pujari.
 
 He said the governing council on higher education, which is scheduled to meet next week, will discuss various issues, including the institution’s launch. “The project is still at the blueprint stage and the council has to decide on the launch timing. It depends on various issues, including the appointment of faculty members,” said Pujari.
