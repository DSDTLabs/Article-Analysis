Pimpri Chinchwad: The NCP’s youth cell on Wednesday staged a demonstration near the civic body’s main office in protest against BJP for not fulfilling the promises it had made during the 2017 municipal elections. 

 Vishal Wakadkar, president of the NCP’s Pimpri Chinchwad youth cell, said though BJP had assured 24x7 water supply, many areas were still facing water shortage and taxes have been increased. 
 
 “The party had also vowed abolition of penalty on unauthorised constructions. But now notices are being sent to people to pay their taxes and penalty charges, otherwise their properties will be seized,” he said.
