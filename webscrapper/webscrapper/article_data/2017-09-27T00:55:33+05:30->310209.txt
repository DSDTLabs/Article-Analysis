NEW DELHI: Resident   of   have written to the institute director asking for the recruitment of a counsellor for them. This, they claim, is important given that the residents work under continuous pressure and stress, related to long working hours which often requires multi-tasking.

 “In the last few years, there have been multiple instances of suicide or attempted suicide in the institute. Some residents are also seeking consultation with   experts,” Dr  , vice-president of AIIMS RDA said. He added that there is no welfare cell for residents in the institute. 
 
 “We strongly demand that there should be at least five counselling psychologists and a 24-hour helpline number to ensure mental well-being of the residents. It will help prevent untoward incidents in future,” the resident doctors have written to AIIMS director. 
 
 Officials said they will look into the matter.
