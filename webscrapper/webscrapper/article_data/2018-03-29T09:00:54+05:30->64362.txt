LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister   on Wednesday launched a scathing attack on  , saying its ideology of socialism was "a ' dhokha' (fraud), ' mrigtrishna' (mirage) and fascism-turned- goondaraj". Yogi was speaking on the last day of the budget session in the  . 

 His remarks evoked uproar in the Upper House with SP legislators demanding deletion of statements from the House proceedings. Leader of Opposition Ahmad Hasan said such language didn't suit a CM. "The word 'socialism' is mentioned in the Constitution. It is the biggest truth of this country," Hasan said.
 
 Yogi shot back. " Samajwad ek mrigtrishna se zyada kuch nahi hai... ye ek bahurupiya brand hai jo kabhi Germany mein Naziwaad aur Italy mein Fasiwaad ke roop mein dekhne ko mila hai... UP mein uska vibhatsaroop goondaraaj ke roop mein dekhne ko mila (Socialism is just a mirage. It's a fake ideology which manifested as Nazism in Germany and as fascism in Italy. In UP, we have seen its ugly side in the form of utter lawlessness)," the CM said. 
 
 SP legislator Shatrudra Prakash said, "If taking up real issues and standing by truth means 'goondaraj', then they we were goondas."
 
 Referring to the SP-BSP tie-up for recent Lok Sabha bypolls, Yogi said SP leaders have become like "circus tiger" which "survives on ' jhoothan' (leftovers) of others". "Some people have become like a circus tiger, which survives on leftovers as it is unable to hunt its prey. It feeds on leftover and gloats over the fact that it got its share of the prey," Yodi said. 
 
 Yogi accused SP chief   of ignoring his father and uncle while siding with BSP. Amid protests by SP legislators, Yogi said, " Aap log Ambedkar ke baare mein kya bolte they... bata dun? Isharon ko samjho (Should I tell the House what you all said about BR Ambedkar. It's better you catch the hint and stay quiet)."
