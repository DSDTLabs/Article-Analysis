Shimla: To counter any threat to the life of Mamta, the wife co-accused Suraj Singh, who was murdered inside the lockup at Kotkhai police station, police have provided her with police security and have deployed eight female police personnel for her protection.

 Mamta had recently told media persons that when the incident took place on July 4, Suraj was working with her in the fields and he had no role in the crime. 
 
 It is being claimed that Suraj Singh, since his arrest, was blaming the alleged main accused Rajender Singh, for the crime. According to sources, Rajender Singh killed Suraj Singh inside the police lock up on Tuesday night as the latter had agreed to become prosecution witness in the case. The Shimla police are not taking any chances with Mamta’s security now.
 
 Ever since the arrest of six accused by police in this case, people are alleging that real accused are being saved. People are out on the streets protesting to get the perpetrators punished. It was under tremendous public pressure that even after SIT of state police claimed to have solved the case, the state government was forced to refer the case to the CBI.
 
 Sources said following the directions of the state high court, the CBI officials had started collecting information, but formal FIR was yet to be lodged.
 
 Former chief minister and leader of opposition Prem Kumar Dhumal demanded chief minister Virbhadra Singh’s resignation and imposition of the President’s rule following Mamta’s statement.
