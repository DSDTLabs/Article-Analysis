NEW DELHI: The government has denied the allegations levelled by   that it had compromised national interest by engaging a tainted UK-based  . 

 Former Kerala chief minister Oomen Chandy told a press conference, "De La Rue has been short-listed for printing of plastic notes in India despite it being blacklisted, it shows complicity at the highest level."
 
 R efuting the charges, a government statement said, "The said company had been supplying bank note paper till 2010. Further as per the decision taken in 2013, the company was permitted to supply a security feature for bank notes till December 2015. No fresh contract has been given to this company by the government during last three years. The security clearance for this company has been withheld by the finance ministry and hence no fresh orders have been placed with the said company since 2014. The company has applied for setting up a factory in India. No action has been taken on their application." 
 
 Chandy said he had written to the Prime Minister, citing a media report, that three companies, including De La Rue, had been short-listed for printing plastic notes and asked for a clarification. He said the government intimated Parliament in 2011 that the said company had been denied security clearance. Given that it was barred from conducting business, Chandy questioned how had the company been allowed to set up operations in India and how it was finding mention on the website of UK-India Tech Summit.
 
 The former CM noted that the value of company shares had jumped by 33% in 2016.
