BHUBANESWAR: Twenty-five days after the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority ( ) capped the prices of stents (the devices that are used to treat blockages in arteries) at Rs 29,500 on February 13, the Odisha drugs controller has asked the suppliers to revise the maximum retail price ( ) of stocks lying in hospitals without moving them out.

 Drugs controller   on Thursday said the suppliers and vendors were asked not to shift the stock for labelling the stents as bulk removal from hospitals for labelling may create artificial shortage in the short term. "We have given them 10 days to change the price tags. But irrespective of change in the price label, the suppliers are charging at the revised rate since the NPPA notified the new price last month," he said. 
 
 The NPPA on February 13 fixed the sealing prices of drug eluting stents at Rs 29,500 and bare metal stents at Rs 7,260 significantly lowering the prices which were being sold at anything between Rs 65,000 and Rs 1.95 lakh.
 
 The Odisha drugs control authorities have come out with a standard operating procedure on stents. As per the protocol, the hospitals will have to periodically intimate the drugs controller regarding selection of manufacturer or vendor of stents by them. They have to keep challan of stent consignments with details such as quantity, address of supplier, manufacturing/expiry dates, batch and MRP.
 
 After use of the stent, the hospital has to inform the supplier by email with patient details and get a final invoice having patient and stent details on it. They also have to maintain records of returning of unused stocks of stents to the vendor, a practice which most hospitals didn't do so far. The drugs controller has also asked the drugs inspectors to inspect hospitals under their jurisdiction to check overpricing if any. "We have not come across any so far," said the drugs controller.
