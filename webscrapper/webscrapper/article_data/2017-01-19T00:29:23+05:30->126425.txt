Indore: A rejoinder had been submitted in a case on the trenching ground being heard by the high court, raising questions over the security and fire safety measures at the dumpyard near Devguradia. The rejoinder against the reply by IMC was recorded by the court on Wednesday, after which the petitioner sought two weeks to file another rejoinder to a reply by the pollution control board. The division bench granted time to the petitioner and listed the matter for further hearing after two weeks. Along with the rejoinder, petitioner Akash Sharma also filed pictures of the trenching ground showing the boundary wall of the ground broken in certain places from where anyone could enter the area. The petitioner also produced pictures of the broken entry gate and claimed the fires at the ground were sometimes started by sanitation workers, who could come in and leave the trenching ground at any time. “The IMC has also not ensured the availability of tenders at the trenching ground to put out fires, which often break out at the dumping yard,” Akash Sharma said. IMC’s earlier reply had stated that there are sufficient water tankers at the trenching ground and gravel roads have also been made for the tenders to travel easily. “It has also been stated in the reply that there are enough CCTV cameras functioning at the trenching ground to track all the action and process,” Rishi Tiwari, IMC’s counsel said. Meanwhile the pollution control board in its reply had claimed that they had filed a complaint against IMC on many occasions regarding the condition at the trenching ground.
