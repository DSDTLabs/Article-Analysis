PATNA: The   (BPSC) on Thursday filed a Letter Patents Appeal (LPA) in Patna high court, challenging an order passed by the court earlier in the day to allow around 35 candidates to appear in preliminary test (PT) of combined civil services exam to be conducted by the commission on February 12.
 
  Earlier in the day, a single bench of Justice Ravi Ranjan, while hearing a petition filed by one Nishant Kumar and 15 others, ordered BPSC to allow them and 19 other interveners to appear for the PT of combined civil services exam and get their applications processed afresh after the exam.
  
  The petitioners had pleaded before the court their admit cards could not be issued from the website of BPSC owing to technical snag, but the BPSC was not allowing them to appear for the PT without it. The petition filed by the aggrieved student before the court on February 3 stated that their forms could not be submitted on the last date (December 12, 2016) due to slow server of the  .
  
  The admit cards were also to be issued online between January 24 and 31 and the candidates, who could not get it, were asked to send e-mail by February 1 requesting the same. The 15 candidates, who could not get the admit cards by February 1, later filed a petition in   on February 3, seeking intervention from the court to allow them to appear in the exam.
  
  The BPSC during the hearing of the petition stated that it issued admit cards to 2.44 lakh candidates and it could not take any fresh measures at the last moment for issuing admit cards to the 35 aggrieved persons. The court, however, directed the BSPC to allow them to appear for the PT exam and get their registration form filed afresh and their results to be declared only after application is found eligible.
  
  Later, the BPSC, through its counsel  , filed an LPA challenging the aforementioned order. The hearing on the LPA would be held before a division bench headed by acting chief justice   on Friday.
