Panaji: On Tuesday, National Institute of Technology (NIT), Goa, director, Prof Udaykumar R Yaragetti, presented silver rings with ‘NIT Goa’ embossed on them to its graduating students. Altogether 114 students — 67 BTech and 47 MTech — received the rings. Currently, only NIT Surathkal and NIT Jaipur present similarly embossed silver rings to their students. “The idea is to give students something to preserve as a remembrance. Each ring is made of four to five grams of silver, thus making them items of value that will not just be discarded post the ceremony. Among the alumni of NIT Surathkal and NIT Jaipur, these rings are valued so much that some students have plated them with gold and continue wearing them, even years after their graduation. And when former classmates meet, the ring becomes a way to identify another NIT graduate who has studied from the same institute as you,” said Yaragetti.  Interstingly, it was Yaragetti, who is acting director of NIT Goa and the full-time director of NIT Jaipur, has introduced the practice from the Jaipur institute. Apart from the convocation ceremony which will be held later in the year, this farewell ceremony was held especially for the presentation of the silver rings to the outgoing students. NIT Goa was set up in 2010 and the fourth batch of BTech students graduate from the institute this year. Over the years, the strength at the institute has grown from just 60 students to over 450 BTech, MTech and PhD students presently.
