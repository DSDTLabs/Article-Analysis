THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Electricity consumption has recorded a   in the state for the   this summer, with the   demand dropping to 3,843 MW from 4,004 MW last year. 

 Several reasons like reduced dependence on irrigation pump sets to new energy-saving devices have been attributed for the trend but no comprehensive study has been made.
 
 Interestingly, this summer was touted as one of the worst in the recent history. Figures with Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) show that the daily average power consumption also dropped to 76 million units from over 80mu last year. Even in conservative terms, power consumption in the state was expected to register a 5% annual growth. 
 
 “The dip in use of irrigation pump sets is a main reason for the fall in power consumption. Since the summer was projected as the worst, the government had taken precautions and the focus was on drinking water projects. The fall in consumption was most evident in Palakkad region in the past two months,” a senior KSEB official said.
