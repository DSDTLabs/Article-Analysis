NEW DELHI: Asserting that "there are very important national issues which are in queue", the   today refused to grant an urgent hearing to a plea challenging the validity of a law that prohibits aborting a  .

 Today's plea related to an SC ruling from Monday, when it refused to allow a Maharashtra woman to abort her 26-week foetus that would be born with Down Syndrome. As per  , a woman cannot undergo an abortion if her pregnancy crosses 20 weeks.
 
 The apex court said today it would grant a hearing only after the summer vacation. By then, the woman would be close to giving birth or would have just given birth - to a child afflicted with Down Syndrome, a congenital disorder which causes intellectual impairment and physical abnormalities.
 
 The apex court said on Monday, when it refused the Maharashtra woman, that aborting a 20-plus week foetus can be allowed only in cases where there is a danger to the life of the mother or the foetus. Medical reports said the woman's child may suffer from physical and mental problems and with low intelligence, but there was no physical risk to the mother in continuing the pregnancy.
 
 Today, the Chief Justice of India JS Khehar said, "there are very important national issues which are in queue to be adjudicated by court and it is not possible now to decide plea on abortion law."
  
 In February, the top court allowed a 22-year-old woman to terminate her 24-week pregnancy on the ground that it would endanger her life.
 
 In January, the apex court allowed a Mumbai-based woman, who was in her 24th week of pregnancy, to terminate her pregnancy under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act. The court took into consideration a medical report that suggested the foetus would not be able to survive without a skull.
