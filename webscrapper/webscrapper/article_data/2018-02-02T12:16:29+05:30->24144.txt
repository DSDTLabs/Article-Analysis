MEERUT: Jagveer Singh, a naib subedar with the Border Security Force (BSF) who is currently posted in Gujarat, broke down in front of the collectorate premises here on Thursday morning after failing to find help from the district administration to remove illegal encroachment on his land by mafia who were allegedly hand in glove with the local sub-divisional magistrate (SDM),  .
 
  Jagveer, 52, a resident of Jalalabad village in   area here, said he had bought a piece of land with a loan of Rs 10 lakh in 2017. With little money to construct a house, Jagveer has been using the land for farming. A team of officials, led by  , had gone to his village recently and destroyed the crop. Jagveer also said that the officials threatened to file a complaint with the BSF authorities and strip him of his rank if he continued to protest.
  
  An inconsolable Jagveer said he had taken leave from work to sort out this matter but has been running from pillar to post seeking help. “The officials abused me when I landed at the Sardhana tehsil for help. No one helped me at the district magistrate’s office as well. I will be forced to immolate myself if this continues,” added Jagveer.
  
  On the other hand, district officials said that Jagveer had illegally occupied the land and repeated warnings have been issued to him to vacate it. “The land is owned by another person. We got possession of it and have handed it over to the land’s owner,” said SDM Rakesh.
  
  “Instead of dying for the country, I will now be forced to die fighting for my land,” said Jagveer.
