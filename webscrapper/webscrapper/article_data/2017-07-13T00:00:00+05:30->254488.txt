Kannada film   was not only one among the biggest hits in the industry, it also catapulted its lead actor Ganesh and director   into a different league altogether. Ten years later, the duo are now gearing up for their next film together — Mugulu Nage. And enroute to Bengaluru from a song launch from this film in  , both Ganesh and   Bhat took a detour to Jog Falls and visited the exact same shoot locations from Mungaru Male that stay etched in the minds of Kannada film viewers.
How was it to go back there? Ganesh recalls, “There is a dialogue in Mungaru Male — ‘Sweet Memories’. This visit brought back exactly that in our minds. It was a flashback or sorts in our minds, as we discussed our experiences during the shoot back then. In addition to the song  , we also shot the last scene of the film here. I was required to stand at the edge of the cliff with a flower in my hand. This was shot between 5.30 and 6 pm, around the time it is growing dark and there is this fog that rises because of the water. You can’t see anything after a point, and that is the reason why people are not allowed near the falls post 6 pm. So, Yogaraj was behind the camera at a distance and   was the mediator between Yogaraj and me.   was instructing me to move left and right and what not, and after a point I was shouting back at him to just get the shot and be done. We all knew we were doing something new with that film, and it was that zeal that gave us more courage to do the unthinkable. In fact, in spite of the strong wind blowing, I was not even tied to a harness. It was risky, but it was something we had to do that day.”
