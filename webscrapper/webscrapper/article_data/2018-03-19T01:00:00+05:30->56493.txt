 and   are all set to put their best foot forward for what is touted to be India’s biggest dance film. The yet-untitled project will be helmed by Remo D’Souza, who has previously worked with Varun in 'ABCD 2'. It will also feature Prabhudheva along with Dharmesh Yelande, Raghav Juyal and Punit Pathak in supporting roles. The movie, expected to go on floors later this year, is slated to release on November 8, 2019.

 Producer  , Chairman and MD,  , says, “Dance and music go hand-in-hand. As a brand synonymous with music, it seemed natural for us to produce India’s biggest dance film. Having a committed director like Remo, who is passionate about dance and has mastered several dance forms, is amazing. Varun is a born entertainer and the audience loves his dance moves. Katrina is talented and hard-working — she also has a mesmerising presence.” 
 
  
  
 Sharing his excitement, Remo adds, “It’s just appropriate that a film about music and dance is produced by the man heading one of the biggest music companies in Bollywood. With this movie, I will get to direct Varun, who is among the best dancers in the film industry today, and Katrina, who has proved her versatility as a dancer.”
 
  
  
 Varun shares, “It’s a huge achievement to work with Remo on what’s going to be India’s biggest dance film. I performed once in New York with Katrina and it was electric. She’s going to bring her ‘A’ game, so I need to get back in shape as well. Bhushan is not only a strong producer, but also contributes creatively, especially in the music department.” 
 Katrina says, “I am excited to be joining Remo’s vision. Varun’s passion is wonderful; he works tirelessly to create magic on screen. And, Bhushan Kumar, with his understanding of market dynamics as a producer, will ensure this turns out to be the most talked-about film of 2019. I can’t wait to start this journey.”
