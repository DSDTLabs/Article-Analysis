NEW DELHI: Three Africans, including a woman, were arrested for honey-trapping a doctor through Facebook and duping him of Rs 40 lakh. The accused - Jacob, James and Sonia - were arrested from east Delhi on Sunday. Sonia had sent a friend request to the complainant, Vijay, a resident of Farsh Bazaar in east Delhi, through a fake Facebook account. 

  She asked to meet him on her visit to India. "Two days later, she called Vijay that she was in Mumbai and customs officials had seized 3.5 lakh pounds from her. She needed to deposit customs fee in Indian currency," said DCP (Shahdara) Nupur Prasad. She asked him to call a UK Embassy officer who would give him pounds for transferring Rs 40 lakh to her.
