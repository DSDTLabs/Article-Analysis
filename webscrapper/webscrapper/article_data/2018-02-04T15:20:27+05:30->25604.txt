Popular rapper  , who won the fifth season of Bigg Boss  , is currently being flooded with film offers. "I do not want to sign any film in a hurry just because I have won the show. Nor do I want to do a film playing a tapori character. I want to do a film that serves as an inspiration to everyone, from children to the older people. If someone offers me one such story, I'd definitely do a film," says Chandan.
