BENGALURU: An epitaph for tombstones? Yes, the BBMP is categorical that no   or as   can come up on graves in the city's 130  , given the   the civic body is facing in laying the dead to rest.That tombstones continue to come up at these graveyards despite the ban is a reality that the civic agency faces.

 The BBMP, which issued a notification banning headstones on graves way back in 2002, says that with no headstones, it's easy to make room for the dead by laying the bodies one over the other. The implementation of the ban hasn't been easy though.
 
 “There's no way the ban can be explained or justified to somebody who has lost a loved one. There have been instances when people wielding influence don't listen to us,“ said a BBMP official at east Bengaluru's Kalpalli graveyard.
 
 The BBMP has been successful in implementing the ban on headstones in some graveyards though.
 
 “Installing granite stones are not allowed because of space crunch at the graveyard. But that doesn't mean the existing ones would be dismantled. Now, only cement plastering is done. My earnings have plummeted,“ said Subramani, a mason at  . On a visit to Kalpalli cemetery, TOI noticed that laying of granite headstones was still on. “The family members come at night and install them, claiming to have permission from higher authorities. What can we do?“ says Sowri Raj, a gravedigger at Kalpalli graveyard.
 
 Spread over 84 acres, the Kalpalli graveyard is the city's biggest. At Kalpalli, in fact, there are not just tombs but little room-like structures (10ftx10ft) with grilled doors on some graves, where relatives of the dead come every year to perform rituals.
 
 “We are gravediggers. Who will listen to us? Boards prominently displaying the ban must be put up at all the graveyards, and public must be made aware of the dos and don'ts,“ said a grave digger at the cemetery.
