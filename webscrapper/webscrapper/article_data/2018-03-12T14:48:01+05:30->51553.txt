MANGALURU: The   district police on Sunday arrested a man, booked under   Act, six years after he was evading the law, while he was selling fish in Moodbidri.

 The accused is identified as   Melwyn Dâ€™Souza alias Jeevan alias Mohammed Salman. He is 32. He hails from Meramajalu in Bantwal.
 
 According to a police officer at the Bantwal Rural police station, Melwyn had committed the crime against the minor in 2012. The girl is a Muslim and Lawrence had introduced himself as a Muslim to the girl. The girl had brought the issue to the notice of her parents, who in turn filed a police complaint against him.
 
 The officer said Melwyn was booked under Section 354 (sexual harassment) of the IPC and Pocso Act, and he was jailed for a year after that. He secured bail after this, and then went on the run.
 
 The police officer said Melwyn then married a Muslim woman, and had been selling fish for a living. Though his official documents maintain his name as Melwyn, it is not sure whether he has embraced another faith.
 
 On receiving a tip-off that he had been selling fish in Moodbidri, police apprehended him.
 
 Police said Melwyn will soon be produced before the second additional district and sessions court in Mangaluru.
