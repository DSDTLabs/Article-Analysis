CHANDIGARH:   (AAP) national spokesman Raghav Chadha on Monday claimed that people of Punjab would not accept the  , “which lacks any credibility and authenticity”.

 “For instance, in the manifesto, Congress talks about giving jobs, pension and welfare schemes to the people of Punjab, however in 2002, when Captain   became chief minister, he immediately after coming into power had put a blanket ban on new recruitment, pensions and on other welfare schemes,” Chadha said. Nobody could believe that Captain Amarinder and his party were serious about delivering the promises they had made in the manifesto, which looked like a bundle of lies, he added.
 
 Congress had now promised 60 lakh jobs in its manifesto, whereas total number of jobs even in the central government was nearly 50 lakh, which included the biggest departments such as the railways and the armed forces.
 
 Head of Punjab Dialogue and chairman of AAP manifesto committee Kanwar Sandhu also ridiculed the manifesto, which, he said, was devoid of even iota of credibility.
 
 Sandhu said, “They have prepared this manifesto while sitting in the air-conditioned comfier environ or pleasurable drawing room, whereas AAP had gone to each and every section of the society for preparing all its manifestos, be it for Dalits, youth, farmers or for industry and traders.”
