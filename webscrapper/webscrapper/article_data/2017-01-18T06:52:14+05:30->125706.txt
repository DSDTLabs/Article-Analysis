HYDERABAD: Exactly a year after the   (UoH) became the epicenter of a nationwide movement against caste discrimination in educational institutions, nothing much has changed on campus, say insiders. In fact, the situation has only worsened with the central university being turned into a fortress and the administration monitoring the minutest of matters. With differences within the university becoming palpable over time, UoH has become a bubble waiting to burst, say those in the thick of things.

 Following the student movement that took root after Rohith’s death, the university management imposed curbs of all kinds including on congregations and group activities. CCTV cameras were set up at the shopping complex that became synonymous with the ‘Justice for Rohith’ movement and frequent police checks became a routine affair. “Over the last one year, if anything has changed, it is that the university administration has become completely autocratic. It has become impossible to get university permission for any student activity,” said K P Zuhail, former president, UoH students’ union.
 
 That the investigation into Rohith’s suicide has not moved an inch – courtesy the ongoing controversy over his caste – and   continues to sit on the V-C’s chair, has only made matters worse, say students.
 
 Speaking about the atmosphere on campus,  , a member of the   said, “It’s like a jail. We are under watch all the time and authorities are trying to control everything on campus, even emotions. We will not give in.”
 
 Despite assurances, the university management has not conducted a single counselling session till date for students under distress. “There is absolutely no support system for students. Students and faculty members are scared of communicating with each other especially if one party is a Dalit and the other a non-Dalit,” said a student who was among the agitators on Tuesday. “If one more Dalit student commits suicide on campus, the campus will explode,” he said.
