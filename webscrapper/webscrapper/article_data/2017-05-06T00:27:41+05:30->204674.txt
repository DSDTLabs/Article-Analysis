THANE: Thane municipal commissioner Sanjeev Jaiswal’s no-nonsense approach against   defaulters which lead to a massive 77% rise in the municipal   in the last three years appears to have emerged as a model for civic bodies across the state.

 Jaiswal’s initiative saw the Thane Municipal Corporation ( ) income soar to a fabulous Rs 2,050 crore at the end of March 2017 as against the annual   of Rs 1,154 crore.
 
 The administrative efforts has won the appreciation of the state government with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis honouring the IAS officers with a prestigious   on Thursday.
 
 Civic officials assert that Jaiswal’s strict enforcement, coupled with the introduction of the name-and-shame campaign (popular as the band-baja concept to shame tax evaders) into paying up are the key reasons to this increasing revenue collection by the corporation.
 
 “The corporation had been losing crores of rupees in revenue because of the high number of tax defaulters in the city. When municipal commissioner   took over the reins of the corporation, he made all the tax collection rules extremely stringent. He even started the band baja concept wherein we would send a band to the residents of the tax defaulters and shame them into paying up their dues. These methods seem to have paid off,” said deputy commissioner Sandeep Malvi.
 
 Under the leadership of Jaiswal, the corporation saw a Rs 222.23 crore increase in revenue from Rs 1,154.37 crores in 2013-14 to Rs1,376.6 crores in 2014-15.
 
 In the following financial year, this recovered revenue went up by Rs 411.91crore to a sum of Rs1,788.51crore. In 2016-17 the revenue collection reached Rs 2,050.09 crore, which was Rs 261.58 crore more than the previous year.
