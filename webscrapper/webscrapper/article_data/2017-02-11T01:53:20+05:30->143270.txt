NEW DELHI: The cash-strapped east and north corporations are battling a new headache with State   ( ) asking the three civic bodies to pay Rs 46 crore to finance the municipal polls due in April. 

 East Corporation, the smallest among the three BJP-ruled bodies, has been asked to pay Rs 10 crore while the north, the largest among the three, and south corporations will have to pay Rs 18 crore. 
 
 According to a constitutional expert, the rules say SEC will conduct civic polls with the money given to it by the corporations. “The municipal corporations were formed with the idea that they would be self-sustaining bodies and will use the money earned through taxes and grants to finance the election expenditure,” he said. Similarly, the state rural development departments have to pay for panchayat elections. 
 
 A source in the east corporation, which is battling to pay even its staff, said, “It is a huge sum for a financially handicapped corporation.” Officials are brainstorming to find a way to pay the poll panel. The corporation may go for a loan, said the source.
 
 The north corporation, which presented a budget with huge deficit earlier this year, is also worried. “We are running short of money to meet even the most pressing expenditure like salaries and pensions. But this demand cannot be overlooked,” said an official. The chairman of its standing committee, Parvesh Wahi, said, “It is a constitutional requirement.” 
 
 The south corporation, which is financially stable, said it would easily pay the amount.
