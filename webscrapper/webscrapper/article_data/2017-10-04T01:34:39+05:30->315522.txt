NEW DELHI: Four members of the   that   by offering them lift in their   and robbed them of their belongings were caught from outer Delhi on Tuesday.

 The gang members used to pick up the targets from railway stations in east Delhi and offered to ferry them for a low fare on share-basis along with other passengers, who were actually their own men. After travelling a little distance, one of the gang members used to give biscuits or other food items — laced with sedatives — to the targets and then rob them of their valuables.
 
 The accused — Parveen, Suraj, Prakash and Avdesh — were arrested from Karala when they were going towards Rani Kheda in outer Delhi in one of their autorickshaws. “They said that they were also involved in several cases of vehicle and car accessory thefts for the last one year from areas around Ranhola, Aman Vihar, Subhash Place, Moti Nagar and Shastri Nagar in north Delhi,” said Pankaj Singh, DCP outer.
 
 Senior officers said, the gang members usually targeted passengers of trains running late. The men had impressive communication skills and were familiar with the dialect of the targets’ native place. They usually “selected their victim the moment he/ she stepped out of the stations”, an officer said. Police also recovered some sedatives used by the gang members that they sprayed or mixed with water and offered to the targets, which made them unconscious within a few minutes. A conservative estimate pins nearly 14% of the total number of criminal activities reported around railway stations or bus depots on the Zeher Khurani gang .
