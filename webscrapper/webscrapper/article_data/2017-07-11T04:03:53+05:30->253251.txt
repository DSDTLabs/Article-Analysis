MUMBAI: The Bombay   on Monday directed the   government to reply if it will review its policy for granting   to prosecute public servants for corruption.

 A bench of justice Rajendra Savant and justice Sadhana Jadhav took note that while the policy states that sanction has to be granted within six months with an extension of three months by the Home Department, a chart showing the status of cases showed that either enquires were closed after a long time or sanction was refused after considerable time has lapsed. In one case open enquiry is pending for 15 years since 2002. “There has to be a timelimit within which open enquiry will conclude,” said justice Jadhav.
 
 The court heard a public interest litigation by activist Ankur Patil, challenging the government resolution which mandates government nod under section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code to prosecute public servants, saying there are many cases pending for sanction.
 
 Frowning upon the tardy pace of open enquiries, the judges pointed out that all the officers are retired. “Then its so simple for you. You need not grant sanction. This is such a farce,” said justice Jadhav. The judges pointed out that the circular fixes outer limit for conclusion of enquiry and grant of sanction. “In how many cases you have done that? You have followed it more in the breach. If sanction is delayed the public servant is entitled for reinstatement. It has to be read between the lines,” said justice Jadhav.
 
 In their order, the judges said, “Time has come for the state government to take a review of the policy contained in the said government resolution.” 
 
 They directed that a responsible officer of the Home Department file an affidavit stating whether the state government will review the decision regarding time frame fixed for the open enquiry.
