Amid the Holi celebrations, Piyush applies colour on Vaidehi's face, leaving everyone in utter shock. Vaidehi also takes colour from Roshni's plate and applies it on Piyush's face.
 
  Roshni is heartbroken and tearful on seeing this, while the rest of the family members are all surprised. Vaidehi tells Roshni that she might have tried doing everything from stopping Piyush from coming to the Holi party but he came and their true love has won.
  
  Roshni tells her that she is Piyush's wife and will protect him from all evil, the first one being Vaidehi herself. This irks the latter.
  
  Later, Piyush starts dancing with Vaidehi and Roshni asks everyone not to stop them as she wants to see if her husband truly cares for her or not.
  
  
 
  
  Vaidehi walks up to Piyush with sindoor and asks him to apply it on her. Roshni doesn't move as she wants to see if her husband would actually go forth and do it or not.
  
  As soon as Piyush is about to apply sindoor on Vaidehi,   walks in and slaps Piyush. He realises his mistake and starts begging for apology, but Simar seems furious and unforgiving.
  
  The family later decides to go to their house and put an end to Holi celebrations.
