SHIMLA: On the issue of making   the second capital, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh has clarified that the announcement is an old one and he has just reiterated it. He said that he had just stated that it was the second capital of state and never said that it would become one. 

 Interacting with mediapersons in Shimla on Monday, when the chief minister was asked whether the government would hold the budget session in Dharamshala this time, he again replied that the announcement was made much before and he had only reiterated it. He said already one session of the assembly was being held in Dharamshala with offices of Chief Engineers of PWD, IPH and HPSEB besides the education board located there. 
 
 He also made it clear that no offices from Shimla would be shifted to Dharamshala but for the time the government would be camping there, officers from Shimla would move there in accordance with the existing practice.
 
 Meanwhile, leader of opposition Prem Kumar Dhumal and state   president Satpal Singh Satti said that making a U-turn on his statements was Virbhadra’s habit. They said that the latter’s statement on second capital was nothing more than a political gimmick. They said through his statements the chief minister was playing with the sentiments of Kangra people.
 
 Dhumal and Satti said first Virbhadra jokingly announced Dharamshala as second capital and now jokingly he made it clear that no offices would be shifted there. Both further said that in the coming assembly elections if people of the state joke with him then it would become difficult for him. They added that it was during the tenure of their government that two secretariats were opened in Dharamshala and every week one minister used to sit there.
