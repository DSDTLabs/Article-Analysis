 He said that he got the news on December 4 around 4pm to 5pm that Jayalalithaa had suffered a massive heart attack and had probably died. "Even some channels showed the news," he said. He then took a flight and came around 10pm to   where he saw that she was kept under ECMO treatment, he said. 
 
 When asked if he went in, he said that she was in the ICU and it was not correct to go into the ICU for fear of spread of infections. "Moreover, she is also a lady, it was not right to do so," he said, stating that he saw her twice at the hospital. 
 
 The judge also asked him about his family, his role and what kind of relation he shared with Jayalalithaa, Dhivaharan said.
