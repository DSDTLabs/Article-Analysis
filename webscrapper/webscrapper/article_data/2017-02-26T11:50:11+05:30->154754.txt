MUMBAI: A   on Thursday rejected the bail plea of the contractor responsible for maintaining   where a flooring collapse earlier this month claimed three lives. The court said it seemed the accused,   (52), knew that negligence in maintaining toilets would cause death. 

 Following the incident on February 3, Bharti was booked by Mankhurd police for culpable homicide not amounting to murder which attracts a maximum sentence of 10 years. The incident took place around 8.15am when several residents of the   slums were waiting to use the toilets. Suddenly, a huge portion of the floor caved in and several people fell into the septic tank. Three of them suffocated to death.
 
 Seeking bail, Bharti's lawyer told the court that the toilet was constructed by the engineer of the   in 2007 and he was appointed as a contractor for maintenance. The lawyer said Bharti had informed the administration about the state of the toilets but they paid no heed. However, the prosecution submitted despite knowing the toilet was not in good condition, Bharti did allowed public to use it. It further argued that since he had not carried out the necessary repairs he was responsible for the three deaths.
 
 The court however pointed out that Bharti was collecting a charge from the public for maintenance and repairs of the toilet. "He is not maintaining the toilet properly and did not take proper care due to which the flooring collapsed and three persons succumbed to injuries," the court said. Accepting that the accused might pressure witnesses if released on bail, the court rejected his bail plea.
