New Delhi: Dinesh Kumar, a software engineer took a home loan to buy a three bedroom   in  . But he is an unhappy man today because he has been informed by the   that he   the   under  . 

 Kumar is facing the brunt of the failure of UP government to include Noida and Gr Noida in the list of towns where the interest subsidy scheme, which was rolled out from Jan last year, is applicable. 
 
 After TOI broke the story of home buyers being upset, UP government started the process to include the two cities eligible for the interest subsidy scheme. Following the report, the housing and urban affairs ministry took up the matter with the state government. “Since these cities are under industrial authorities, the state industry department has to forward their names for inclusion in the list. Our team is in Lucknow and we are confident of finding a solution soon,” said a central government official, who did not wish to be named.
 
 He added the Centre is looking at options how to bring some relief to a large number of first time house owners, who bought flats in these two cities with the hope that they would get the interest subsidy benefit. The people from middle income groups with annual income up to Rs 18 lakh are eligible for interest subsidy, which is about Rs 2.6 lakh. While applicants from about 300 cities and towns have availed the benefit, home buyers in Noida and Greater Noida are yet to get this.
 
 “My bank kept on demanding letters, applications with the assurance that I will get the interest subsidy benefit under PMAY. But when the loan was sanctioned and the EMI started, I was told the two cities are not covered under the scheme,” said Aman Saikia, who recently bought house on Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.
