AHMEDABAD: In an alarming rise, the number of   cases reported in the city has doubled within a week’s time according to civic body data. 

 The weekly health report of   (AMC) released on Monday revealed that some 59 people had to be admitted to civic body-run hospitals in the city as they were suffering from dengue from July 1-30.
 
 However, the actual number of people suffering from dengue happen to be much more.
 
 TOI’s random check on civic body-run and civil hospitals revealed that 49 cases of dengue were reported in the first two weeks of July itself. At that time, civic authorities claimed only six cases were reported in the city. 
 
 When asked for reasons of the discrepancy,  , medical officer, health, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, said, “After the hospital reports these cases before AMC, it takes us at least 15 days to confirm the cases.
 
  Only after necessary scrutiny and testing of samples that the final number is declared.” 
 
 In the wake of the recent spell of heavy rain, the mosquito outbreak is likely to multiply.
 
  This is evident with the mosquito density (number of mosquitoes per room) of Aedes aegypti, which causes zika, dengue and chikungunya, which has gone up in several areas, including Amraiwadi, Chandkheda, Dariapur and Shahibaug.
 
 Apart from dengue, some 887 cases of malaria, 42 cases of falciparum malaria and two cases of chikungunya were reported in the city till July 29, according to the civic body data. 
 
 However, data by   in   revealed that some 14 cases of chikungunya were reported in the city.
