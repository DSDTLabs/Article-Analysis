NAGPUR:   and conductors, who were employees of  , took out a protest rally on Friday to protest the   of new city bus operators. These operators are not recruiting them and are going in for fresh recruitment as new drivers are ready to work at lower wages. Between 500 and 600 staffers have not been absorbed by the new operators.

 Maharashtra General Kamgar Union (MGKU) has taken up the case of these drivers. MGKU office-bearers and representative of Starbus drivers met additional municipal commissioner Ramanath Sonawane and told them about the injustice meted out to the drivers and conductors. Sonawane decided to convene a meeting of representatives of the three bus operators on March 22 to enquire about the allegations levelled by MGKU.
 
 MGKU leader Verghese Chako said that the new operators were exploiting the drivers and conductors. “They are seeking a deposit of Rs7,000 from conductors and Rs15,000 from drivers. Vansh Nimay had only taken Rs5,000 per head. We had requested the new operators to get the money transferred from Vansh Nimay’s accounts but this demand was not accepted. Moreover, the staffers are not even being issued receipts,” he told TOI. Chako further said that the new operators were also not paying overtime to the staffers even after making them work for two full shifts. 
 
 The union leader said that Sonawane fully agreed with the demand of the staffers. “He said that per labour laws and court judgments, Vansh Nimay staffers should be recruited first and only if there are vacancies should new people be taken in. He also agreed to check the biometric attendance records to find out whether staffers were being denied overtime,” he added.
 
 The staffers charged that   transport officer Shivaji Jagtap had turned a deaf ear to their complaints. “His directives to the operators are not being followed but he is not taking any action against them,” they said.
