 was delighted to meet her college friend after years at a   here. The actress said that though she is seen rarely at events in Delhi, she visits the city often to meet her family. "Delhi has always been home, I studied at Lady Shri Ram College here. When I come to meet my family, I just want to spend time with them, I come to Delhi every month," said Sakshi. 

  She also spoke about her love for saris and how she bought one with her first salary. "I am really fond of wearing saris and I have a good collection of them. Wherever I go, I try and get saris from there. When I went to Varanasi, I picked up some hand woven Banarasi saris. I was fascinated by saris since my childhood. Even as a kid, I would drape my mum's old sari and pretend to be a teacher. As a child, I'd often think, that when I start earning money, I'll have my own sari collection. With my first salary of Rs900 I bought a sari. I worked as a sales trainee at a five-star hotel in Delhi. After finishing class 12, there was a summer job offered to some students. As a sales trainee, I was dealing with saris. That was back in 1990."
