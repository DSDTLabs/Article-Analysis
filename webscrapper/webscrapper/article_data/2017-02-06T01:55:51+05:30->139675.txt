ALLAHABAD: Not just their own horoscope, some candidates in UP are checking how deep the competition is for them by getting astrologers to examine their rivals’ fortunes as well.

 Two prominent astrologers of the city said most of their clients are assuming BJP candidates as their immediate rival. Noted astrologer Fanindra Nath Tripathi said “every candidate wants to know the weak ‘grah’ (planet) of their rivals”. Saying “minor problems can be set right with the help of ‘havan’ and ‘grah shanti’ rituals”, another astrologer is convinced that “it is impossible for a candidate to win if the opponent’s stars are stronger.”   are known to seek astrologers’ help to identify auspicious times to fl ag off campaigns, to check lucky colours, even for their vehicles and also clothes that help them impact voters.
 
 But now matters have moved a step further. the trend was also noted by Narendra Giri, mahant, Baghambari Mutt and president, Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad: “Many astrologers are examining janma kundalis (natal chart) for information of a contestant’s rivals.” He denies he is advising any candidate.
