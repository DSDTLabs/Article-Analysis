JALANDHAR: A 17-year-old girl from a poor   was kidnapped and gang-raped for five months by five persons, including three brothers and two of their friends. Despite repeated complaints by the girl's family,   (Rural) police failed to recover her. 

 The girl, a factory worker, went missing in the middle of September 2016 and her family lodged a complaint. 
 
 The girl finally fled from captivity with the help of a relative of the accused in mid-February. When she returned home, she realised she was pregnant and her family approached the police again. But, the cops were unmoved.
 
 A case of murder and kidnapping was registered against the five accused on Tuesday after a local activist Mohammad Kaleem took the family to Jalandhar (Rural) senior superintendent of police GS Bhullar. 
 
 He suspended the Maqsoodan police station SHO Sukhpal Singh and ASI Raghbir Singh, who was handling the case, and initiated an inquiry.
