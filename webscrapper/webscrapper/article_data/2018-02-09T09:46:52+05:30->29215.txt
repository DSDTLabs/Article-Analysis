Having already qualified for the quarterfinals, the Indian team management made some changes in their playing line-up but the move did not bore fruit as both the Indian teams lost their last league matches in the Asia Team Badminton Championships at Alor Setar, Kedah in Malaysia on Thursday.

 
 While Indian women found formidable Japan too hot to handle and succumbed 1-4, their men's counterparts went down fighting to Indonesia 2-3. In the quarterfinals to be held on Friday, Indian women's team will lock horns with Indonesia. The men's team will have to play out of their skin as they face a strong China for a spot in the semis. PV   provided a perfect start by setting aside Akane Yamaguchi in straight games to give 1-0 lead.
 
 However, Sindhu's win failed to inspire her teammates as Japan bounced back to record 4-1 win in the Group W outing.
 
 The men's Group D encounter was an exciting affair. At one stage India were leading 2-1 despite   losing his first singles. But Indonesia rallied back to post a narrow victory to emerge group toppers.
 
 India fielded doubles specialists   and B   in the singles to rest the regulars for Friday's tough battles. The Indians, however, were beaten by their opponents in the last two matches to lose the tie. The doubles pair of Arjun M R and Ramchandran Shlok squandered a game lead to lose the match 21-14 16-2112-21 before B Sumeeth Reddy surrendered tamely to Ihsan Maulana Mustofa 12-217-21in the third singles.
