Hyderabad: Buoyed by around 20% growth in revenue collections last year,   is hopeful of maintaining robust growth in tax revenues this fiscal too, Somesh Kumar, principal secretary (commercial taxes and excise), Telangana, said here on Wednesday.

 Despite the initial hiccups faced by stakeholders due to implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the state, Telangana clocked around 20% rise in revenue collections in 2017-18 at Rs 41,154 crore. In 2016-17, the revenues of the state rose by 17%.
 
 “20% is already a high growth rate… and now if they (GST Council) bring reverse charge mechanism and invoice matching, we can expect another 1-2% rise. But even if it is not done, we can expect 20% growth,” he said on the sidelines of a Ftapcci event in city.
 
 This month, a committee headed by Bihar deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi will deliberate on ways to reintroduce the reverse charge mechanism, a key anti-evasion tool that was suspended until June 30, 2018, in the wake of protests by traders across the country.
 
 Meanwhile, speaking about the e-way bill that has become mandatory for movement of goods valued over Rs 50,000 from one state to another from April 1, he said the state has not faced any issues in implementing the system as it has already been following the e-way bill system for many years now.
 
 The national e-way bill system was introduced on April 1, 2018, across the country for generation of e-waybills for inter-state movement of goods. The e-way bill for intra-state movement will be generated from April 15 in Telangana.
 
 Kumar pointed out that the total number of Telangana dealers registered for e-way bill as on April 11 stood at 51,068 and the total number of Telangana transporters registered for e-way bill as on the same date stood at 431.
 
 Giving additional details about the implementation of the e-way bill system in the state, he said the total number of e-way bills generated by Telangana dealers upto April 10 stood at 1,46,893 and the value of inter-state e-way bills (outward and inward) generated upto April 10 stood at Rs 4,959 crore.
