HYDERABAD: Justice A   of the   on Wednesday sought to know from the states of AP and Telangana, their principal secretaries of education, commissioners of school education and the director of   of education, research and training (SCERT) as to why they have not restored the lesson on the life of former Prime Minister   in the Hindi textbook of Class VIII. 

 The judge was responding to a petition filed by Ongole journalist  , who said he was aggrieved with the way the authorities were treating a "gigantic leader who single-handedly saved the country from the financial crisis in 1991 by bringing in reforms."
 
 According to P Siva Kumar, counsel for the petitioner, the lesson on the life of PV was introduced in the Class VIII Hindi textbook in 1991 by the then united state of AP and that the lesson explained the rare qualities of the former PM who lead the country through a consensus approach. He presided over a stable government in difficult times despite lacking numbers in Lok Sabha, said the petitioner. In 1997, the TDP government removed the lesson from the Hindi textbook following certain allegations against the late Prime Minister. Though a subsequent probe by the CBI gave PV a clean chit, the lesson was never restored in the textbook, he said. "Though I have been seeking replies from the authorities of AP and Telangana through RTI route, their replies were never straight and they were referring my representations to various wings without anyone giving me a clear answer to my queries," Srinivasulu said and sought a direction to the authorities concerned to reintroduce the lesson on the late PM Narasimha Rao.
