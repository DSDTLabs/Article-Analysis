Mahuva: In order to meet the demand for hybrid coconut by farmers in the state,   ( ) has established Elite Seed Farm for coconut DxT (Mahuva) variety. Production on large scale has been initiated at JAU’s Coconut Research Station in Mahuva, Bhavnagar.

 “We had planted Dwarf Green as female and West Coast Tall as male in 2011at our elite farm. This will boost the coconut production in the state as we will be able to provide pure seedlings to coconut growers,” said a scientist from JAU.
 
 “The elite farm is a model coconut farm for large scale production of seed and it is estimated that it will produce over 50,000 hybrid seeds annually from next year. Choosing right hybrid variety is key for early production and better yield,” said Dr. A R Pathak, vice-chancellor, JAU, Junagadh.
 
 JAU officials said that they are in talks with some coconut growers who want to turn into coconut seed growers to provide good quality seedlings in the state.
