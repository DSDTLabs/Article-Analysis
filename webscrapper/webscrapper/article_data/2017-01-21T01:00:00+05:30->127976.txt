Social media went into a tizzy when Rubina Dilaik — the vulnerable, soft-spoken Saumya in 'Shakti... Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki' — posted a picture of hers in a smokin’ hot bikini. Not many could relate her bold, modern avatar to the tongue-tied kinnar (transgender) in the daily soap. 
But Rubina is not the one to get bogged down by public opinion. Reacting to the feedback her picture got, the actress says, “I didn’t post the picture for instant gratification nor did I wait to see how many people liked it. I know how to represent myself on social media. Actors are mostly recognised by the characters they play and it’s normal for fans to get shocked on seeing them in a different avatar. The real me is outgoing and vivacious. It doesn’t bother me how people perceive my pictures. It actually depends on how evolved they are. Nasty comments don’t influence my thinking and I don’t let them disturb me.”
 Her independent thinking, we point out, reflects in her choice of roles. So, what made her play a transgender? “There were apprehensions, as many of my contemporaries had turned down the offer. In fact, such a character has never been attempted on TV before. But the uniqueness made it intriguing for me. It could have backfired, but I had no hopes tied to it. I took it up to prove my mettle as an actor and I am glad the risk has paid off,” she sums up.
