BENGALURU: The   ( ) is likely to reduce the length of its underground section of the proposed 21-km Nagawara and Gottigere corridor. It is also mulling reducing the number of packages of the underground section from four to two to get competitive pricing from bidders.

 BMRCL had earlier proposed an underground section spanning 14km between Dairy Circle and Nagawara on the corridor. Sources said the length is likely to be reduced to less than 8km. However, there will not be any change in the alignment. With BBMP beginning work on widening of  , BMRCL may build an elevated line instead of the underground section. “We are now considering going for an elevated section on wider roads like Bannerghatta Road. This will reduce the project cost and help in speedy construction,” said a BMRCL official.
 
 BMRCL had split the 8.8-km underground section of the Phase 1 project into two packages and the work took almost five years to complete. Challenges that cropped up during the tunnelling work delayed the project. 
 
 Bids to undergo scrutiny 
 
 The work on Nagawara and Dairy Circle line was divided into four packages to attract more bidders. The line was to be part of an extended corridor linking Nagawara to Kempegowda International Airport.
 
 Larsen & Toubro, Gulermak, Afcons Infrastructure and Italian-Thai Development have offered a package each on the Dairy Circle-Nagawara underground section. The lowest bid received by BMRCL amount to Rs 8,553 crore compared to its estimate of Rs 5,047 crore.
 
 Sources said the bids will now undergo scrutiny by the evaluation committee. BMRCL may tweak the design and packages after approval from the   (EIB). Reducing the number of packages will result in increased number of bidders being in the race and bring in an element of competition, they claimed.
 
 EIB and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) have committed Rs 5,786 crore loan towards the Phase II underground section.
