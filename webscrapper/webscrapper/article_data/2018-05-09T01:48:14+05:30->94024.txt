GURUGRAM: Six employees of a city-based machine manufacturing firm have been booked for fraudulently withdrawing Rs 1.3 crore from different bank accounts of the company.

 In his complaint to police, Pushkar Singh, the company’s account manager, said an internal inquiry had revealed that these employees stole signed blank cheques kept in his cabin and withdrew around Rs 1.30 crore from different accounts over the past few months.
 
 Based on the complaint, police filed an FIR under sections 420 (cheating), 381 (theft) and 120B (conspiracy) of the IPC against Amit Gosai, Mangal Singh Bist, Rajiv Sahay, Amit Chopra, Mandal Mishra and Arvind Pandey.
 
 “For convenience and to meet urgent financial needs, we always keep blank cheques with signatures of our director. Some of the employees stole some of these signed cheques and transferred the money to other accounts,” the account manager alleged. According to him, the company has 31 accounts in 23 different bank branches.
 
 “During an internal audit, it came to our notice that Rs 1.30 crore had been fraudulently withdrawn from different accounts of the company,” Singh added.
 
 Police sources said some of the employees knew where singed cheques were kept in the office, and they had access to them. The cheques were encashed in different banks on different occasions.
 
 Ravinder Kumar, a spokesperson for Gurugram police, said, “Police are investigating the matter and expected to arrest the accused soon.”
