Hyderabad: Bengaluru-based online product rental services provider GrabOnRent on Monday announced the launch of its services in Hyderabad with six categories, including home appliances and furniture, among others. The company has 50 partners in Hyderabad.

 The partners list their products on the GrabOnRent platform and consumers can rent them either for a long-term (on an average 7.5 months) or a short-term (1.5 days) basis by paying a certain amount. 
 
 Set up in September 2015 and backed by IvyCap Ventures and Unicorn India Ventures, GrabOnRent offers furniture, household appliances, electronics, bikes, party and event equipment on rent. It plans to foray into Chennai, NCR, Pune and Mumbai in near-term for which it plans to raise Rs 30 crore in Series-A funding, GrabOnRent CEO Shubham Jain said. It also rents products like laptops to corporates and draws over 20% of its revenues from this category. “There has been a tremendous rise in the renting economy, both vertically and horizontally. Awareness and acceptance among people for rented goods has been a major driver of this growth. Also, with a rise in mobility for education and career opportunities, renting becomes the preferred option to access products without having to spend upfront on purchasing,” he added.
