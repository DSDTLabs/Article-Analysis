NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has transferred a four-year-old "Ponzi scheme" case involving senior bureaucrats and police officers in   from Delhi police to the  . 

 Justice   in a recent order asked the Burari police station to hand over all files related to the case to the CBI after the police was unable to make any headway in the alleged scam.
 
  "The facts of the present case clearly show that the present is a fit case for transfer of investigation to the CBI by a high ranking officer, considering the fact that senior bureaucrats, including IPS officers, appear to be involved in what could well be a multi-victim scam having pan-India ramifications. The status report, as filed, betrays the fact that the investigating officer is even shy of naming the high ranking officers of the IPS and other bureaucrats. This court is, therefore, convinced that the Delhi police would be severely handicapped in undertaking effective investigation and bringing the case to its logical conclusion," HC observed in its order. 
 
  HC acted on the petition filed by lawyer  , who alleged that senior officers of Mizoram government duped people by making them invest in a marketing company called   (MDML) by passing it off as a public entity. The Mizoram government later issued a disclaimer that the state had no relation with MDML. "Looking to the seriousness of the case and considering the fact that CBI is an independent police force and hopefully beyond influence, I am of the view that this is a fit case where investigation should be transferred to the CBI. The investigation shall be entrusted to a high ranking officer who would be beyond reproach, and holds a position higher to those named as accused by the petitioner," the judge said, adding that investigation should be concluded at its earliest.
