HYDERABAD: All stations under   are set to come up with folding wheelchairs and ramps for passengers with disabilities and senior citizens. But the passengers will have to pay charges to avail of the new facility.

 It used to be a nightmare for people, as many stations were devoid of minimum facilities. The situation is very bad at   station. Even though the foot overbridges have escalators, there is a lack of space for comfortable movement in wheelchairs. A ramp will push the wheelchair into the coach. The folding ramp can hold weights up to 250kg. The doors of AC coaches are comparatively narrow, but railway officials said the wheelchairs will move inside easily, including aisles of compartments. The carrying capacity of each wheelchair is about 100kg . 
 
 Trial run of the initiative has been undertaken in   division. On January 18, the service will be launched officially for   express and then it'll be extended to other SCR divisions.
