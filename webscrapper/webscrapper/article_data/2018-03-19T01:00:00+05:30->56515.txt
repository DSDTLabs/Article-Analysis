In their bid to recreate the magic of the 1980s, the makers of ' ' have revisited Madhuri Dixit’s cult number ' ' from 'Tezaab'. The reprised version, presented by T-Series, is a tribute to the dancing diva of the 1980s, and features   reinventing the Mohini act by gyrating to the foot-tapping beats of the number. 

 A teaser of the track from the Tiger Shroff-Disha Patani-starrer, directed by Ahmed Khan, was released recently. With the aim of making it one of the year’s finest chartbusters, the makers have pulled all stops and added new ingredients to the yesteryear hit. However, the lyrics from the original track have been retained; ditto the tune. The song, originally choreographed by Saroj Khan, has been redesigned by Ganesh Acharya along with Ahmed Khan.
 
 For those who have come in late, 'Baaghi 2' is the second film in the franchise and revolves around Tiger and Disha’s action-packed journey of love.
 
 'Baaghi 2', produced by Nadiadwala Grandson and Fox Star Studios, releases on March 30, 2018.
