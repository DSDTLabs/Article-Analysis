  SAMMAN would include counselling of expectant mothers for safe birthing and regular screening of mothers to ensure that baby and mother’s growth is normal. The initative will focus on developing a ‘birthing plan’ for each expectant mother in three districts through technical intervention/surveillance by hospital staff and auxiliary nurse midwives. These expert mentors will gather in special learning labs. In the pilot stage, one such lab has been started in Laksar under Vriddhi, a project aimed at improving reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCH+A) in Uttarakhand.
  
  Dr Nitin Bisht, who is involved in Vriddhi, said, “In these learning labs, 30 auxiliary nurse midwives met every tenth day to share their clients’ pregnancy progress and discussed the importance of antenatal and postnatal care which hold the key to tackle NMR and   (MMR). The prime objective of SAMMAN is to bring down NMR to 12 and MMR to 70 which is in accordance to sustainable goals 2030.”
  
  The MMR in Uttarakhand stands at 165, according to Annual Health Survey 2012-13.
