NEW DELHI: Delhi University students are spoilt for a choice when it comes to places to hangout. From eateries to apparel stores, there are options galore for students that are also affordable. 

 “Hudson Lane and Satya Niketan markets have grown exponentially in the last three years. Students love the ambience of the cafes here and keep coming back,” said Udai Khanijow, owner of Big Yellow Door restaurant chain. A management graduate, Khanijow started the continental eatery with the youth in mind. Now, students queue up for a table. 
 
 More menu options make these eateries more in demand than the simple college cafeterias. 
 
 But street food, too, is quite popular. Satya Niketan, Kamla Nagar, GK M block market and other places in   offer great street   options that cost anything between Rs 30 and Rs 100. 
 
  students swear by the Chowringhee Lane rolls at Satya Niketan market which does brisk business throughout the day. Jiten Sharma and his friends make sure that they visit the eatery every time they pass by the area to relive old memories. “We used to look forward to the last class around 4pm and tried to make it to Chowringhee Lane before other students could crowd it,” said Sharma, an alumnus of Sri Venkateshwara College. 
 
 PG accommodations around the area have added to the popularity of the food joints in the area. Apart from eateries, shops selling cheap clothes and knockoffs of famous brands also attract students to places like Kamala Nagar market and GK M-Block market. 
 
 “Although clothes here aren’t exacty cheap, we preferred to unwind here with friends by simply strolling around the market during the short breaks we used to get in between our classes,” said Aditi Jha, an alumna of Lady Shri Ram College.
