PUNE: The two   which were brought to the city towards the end of 2016, will finally be put on display for the public at the   in Katraj on Sunday. This is the only pair of pure Asiatic Lions in the state.

 Speaking to TOI, zoo director Rajkumar Jadhav said: “After their arrival, the lions were kept under quarantine as per the rules of the   (CZA). At the time, they had sustained minor skin injuries. After these small wounds healed, we kept them under observation to ensure they adapt to their new surroundings.”
 
 “Now, we have moved them to the enclosure, and they will be on display from tomorrow (Sunday),” he added. 
 
 For moment, the lions — named Tejas and Subhi — will occupy the enclosure meant for the White Tiger. Meanwhile, the White Tiger and the Royal Bengal Tiger will be moved to a different enclosure. The construction of their permanent enclosure has run into a few delays.
 
 “We aim to have the enclosure ready in the next 8-9 months. Their current enclosure matches the required size of 2,600 sqmt and has all the features they would need to be comfortable,” the zoo director said.
 
 The purebred Asiatic Lions, both around six years old, were brought to the city from   in Junagadh, the only place that breeds this species. The   had offered the Junagadh facility a variety of birds in exchange. The proposal for bringing these lions to the city was made nearly three years ago, and Jadhav played a key role in facilitating the exchange.
