KOLKATA: Though   missed Eid, she is now looking forward to celebrating Durga Puja back home in  . And she has all the reason to rejoice because doctors have managed to re-attach two fingers of her left hand which got severed in an accident. For over two months, this 30-year-old schoolteacher has been confined in the plastic surgery ward at   and Hospital.But she is now happy and fit.“I missed Eid. But I am happy that I will not miss Durga Puja. I am in a festive mood because this is the time of the year when I catch up with friends and relatives. I am excited that I will be home on Shasthi,“ Akhtar told TOI.

 The life science teacher was pillion riding on way to her school on July 17 when she met with an accident. A motor van trying to overtake her brotherin-law's bike had crashed into them, chopping off the index and middle fingers of her left hand.
 
 “I nearly fainted when I saw that my index finger was completely detached and was lying on the road. My middle finger, too, was almost severed," Akhtar recounted.
 
 But Akhtar did not lose her nerve.She asked her brother-in-law to fetch a bottle of mineral water and a plastic bag from a nearby shop, and to wash and pack the fingers. They rushed to the nearby rural health centre, where doctors helped wrap the plastic bag in ice. Akhtar and her relative then went to RG Kar. “The patient arrived in the emergency ward around 11am. Luckily, we had an OT table available," said Dr R N Bhattacharya, head of the plastic surgery department.
 
 A team of surgeons led by Dr Gaurab Chaudhuri and anaesthetist Dr Goutam Chaudhuri operated on Akhtar from noon till 11pm. “The procedure is easier when the limb or the finger is severed due to cut injury. In this case it was crush injury . And the more the injury gets closer to the lower part of the limb, narrower are the vessels.That makes it more challenging," said Dr Gaurab Chaudhuri.
