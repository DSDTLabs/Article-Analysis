New Delhi: The AAP-led Delhi government on Monday   the amended   and   for   of Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal recently approved the rules after several rounds of vetting.

 Sources said the Delhi government will now form around 25 town vending committees instead of 71 as proposed in the initial rules that were notified in January 2016. “We will form one committee for every 10-11 municipal wards. It will have vendors, government officials, NGOs and other stakeholders as members. The municipal commissioner will head the vending committees,” said an official.
 
 The amendments were made after the Delhi high court last year observed that street vendors’ rights were “grossly affected” due to the delay and asked the government to fast track the setting up of town vending committees, which is mandatory under the street  .
 
 Following this, the government had made the amendments and sent the rules and schemes to the LG for approval. Sources said the LG had approved it in September last year. The rules were then sent for legal vetting. “We got the final approval from the LG two weeks back,” said a source.
 
 Though the   is yet to upload the gazette notification on its website, sources confirmed the changes regarding the committees. Though the government has reduced the number of committees, vendor associations still feel implementation of the Act will be difficult. “Forming so many town vending committees will defeat the purpose. The government should form a grievance redressal committee to address the concern of vendors,” said Arbind Singh, national coordinator, National Association of Street Vendors of India.
