HYDERABAD:   pacer   blamed his team's profligate bowling for the four-run loss to   in an Indian Premier League match.

 "I think it's too many runs. Everyone has given so many runs. We did not get early wickets. Because of that, we lost. In IPL, you need early wickets," he said in the post-match press conference.
 
 He complemented Sunrisers Hyderabad captain   for his 126-run knock, which came off 59 balls, and helped his team post a mammoth total of 209 runs.
 
 "He (Warner) played beautifully. He used all the chances and got a hundred. He is a good batsman. He made many centuries in the ODIs and Tests also. He is a world-class batsman. It's a beautiful innings from him," he said.
 
 Asked if Sunil Narine is leaking runs because of his current focus on batting, Yadav said no bowler can escape the blame for last night.
 
 "It can happen to anybody. It can happen with me. I have also given 50 runs in four overs. It's difficult when someone is hitting properly and someone is striking good. It can happen to anybody.
 
 "It can happen to Malinga also tomorrow. The situation the team is in at present, we need someone who can hit the ball properly. I think Sunil had that confidence. That's why he is opening the innings," he said.
