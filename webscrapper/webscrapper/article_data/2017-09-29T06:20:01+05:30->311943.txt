SURAT: The   (SGTPA) has strongly demanded level playing field for the man-made fabric (MMF) sector. Currently, the Goods and Service Tax (GST) on MMF yarn is 18%, while that on fabric is 5%. Whereas, for cotton yarn and fabric, the   rate is uniform at 5%.

 The SGTPA leaders met the sectoral co-convener of   Yogendra Garg on Wednesday and demanded that the council must seriously consider providing a level playing field to the MMF sector vis-à-vis the cotton sector. The association said that polyester fabric is known as the fabric of poor. Surat’s textile sector manufacture saris below Rs 200. On the other hand, the cotton fabric is for the elite class. However, the central government has divided the MMF and cotton sectors by keeping separate GST rates for yarns and fabric. 
 
 SGTPA president Jitu Vakharia said, “We have strongly recommended the co-convener of GST Council to keep the GST rates uniform in both the sectors. If the GST rate in both the sectors are uniform, then the textile sector will have a level playing field in the consumer market.”
 
 Vakharia added, “At present, the textile sector is facing a lot of difficulties and challenges due to the differential GST structure for the MMF sector. Most of the weaving units doing job work has almost shut the shops . More than 50,000 workers have been rendered jobless in the last two months.”
 
 President of the   Kamal Tulsiyan said, “The government must seriously think about the MMF sector, otherwise it will be ruined in the coming days. The downfall of the sector has started. ”
