GANDHINAGAR: Finally, on Monday, 1986 batch IAS officers of   received their pending promotions elevating them to rank of additional chief secretary ( ). Officers of the same batch in other states had received the promotion long back.

 Key faces among the 1986 batch officers who will benefit from Monday’s order include Sanjay Prasad, Pankaj Kumar, Vipul Mitra, Rajiv Gupta and P D Vaghela.
 
 Among the state’s 1986 batch IAS officers, only Sangeeta Singh, principal secretary, civil supply and consumer affairs had received her promotion to ACS before others, because one post of ACS had fallen vacant after the retirement of P K Taneja.
 
 Officers believe that the cascading effect of Monday’s order will bring promotions of later batches of IAS officers in line with those of their counterparts in other states. The promotion of 1986 batch officers to ACS rank had already been carried out in states like Haryana, Karnataka, and Madhya Pradesh, much before it was implemented in Gujarat. 
 
 In Gujarat, the state government had delayed implementation citing lack of vacant posts. However, chief secretary   was reportedly able to convince the government to promote all 1986 batch IAS officers from principal secretay to ACS rank.
