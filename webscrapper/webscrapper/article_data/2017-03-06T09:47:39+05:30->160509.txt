IMPHAL: If Congress has appealed to   by promising to safeguard  ,  , which has fielded candidates in all   in the hill districts of the state, has been advocating peace in the hills. 

 To combat the Hindu-Meiteis of Imphal Valley, a traditional Congress stronghold, BJP is wooing people belonging to non-Hindu religious groups. It is doing so by stressing on protection of religious and cultural identity. The second phase of polls on March 8 will see 22 of the state's 60 assembly seats vote; half of them are ST-reserved and Christian-dominated. The results on Saturday will prove if the party's gamble has paid off, but BJP spokesperson N Biren Singh expressed confidence.
 
 "Our popularity among Christians and Muslims is on the rise. We want to reiterate that all communities will have the freedom to practise their religion and culture here. At present, Manipur is a state divided on ethnic lines. We are committed to bringing unity between the hills and the valley," he said.
 
 Congress leaders, however, also lay claim to the allegiance of voters belonging to non-Hindu groups. Chief minister Ibobi Singh has, on different occasions, accused BJP of spreading communal tension in the state. At a recent election rally here, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi charged BJP and RSS with wanting to 'crush'  's pride and identity.
