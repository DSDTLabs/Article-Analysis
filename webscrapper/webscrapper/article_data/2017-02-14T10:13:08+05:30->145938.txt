CHENNAI: The city police on Monday booked a senior AIADMK leader, who owes allegiance to party general secretary V K Sasikala, for making a ' ' last week against chief minister O Panneerselvam. 

 Police booked AIADMK south Chennai (north) district secretary and former MLA V P Kalairajan under different sections of the IPC, including 'criminal intimidation'.
 
 AIADMK members on February 5 elected Sasikala as party legislature Leader, a step to her elevation as the chief minister. Two days later, however, Panneerselvam revolted against her, alleging that she forced him to step down so she could take his place. Following this, Kalairajan said in an interview, "He [Panneerselvam] is planning to capture the party headquarters. If he lays a hand [on the headquarters], he will lose his arm..."
 
 The video went viral on social networking sites.
 
 Following this, an AIADMK functionary from neighbouring Kancheepuram district, submitted a petition to the Chennai police in which he sought action against Kalairajan for making derogatory remarks against Panneerselvam.
 
 The complaint stated that Kalairajan threatened Panneerselvam with dire consequences. Complainant N Chellapandian, an AIADMK students' unit wing functionary in Kancheepuram central district, demanded police action on his complaint.
