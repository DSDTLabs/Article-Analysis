NEW DELHI: Looking to score a political point, MPs of the   took up the issue of violence in the lead up to the panchayat polls in the state with President   on Thursday. 

 
 A delegation of   MPs along with alleged victims of the violence met the President over allegations made by   accusing members of the Mamata Banerjee-led party of forcibly preventing its candidates from filing nomination papers for the panchayat polls in the state. This was a counter move to the BJP which met the President last week with state leaders and alleged victims of violence from the state. 
 
 TMC MPs hit out at the opposition for perpetrating violence against its party workers and supporters, as it appealed to President   to outright reject the “malicious campaign” against the   government.
