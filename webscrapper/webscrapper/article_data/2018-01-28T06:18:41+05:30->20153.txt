LUCKNOW: The rising pollution and deteriorating Swachh Bharat ranking of Lucknow have compelled Centre to select it in the first list of 15 cities for launch of electric buses.

 The urban transport department plans to launch these buses by June 2018.
 
 Under the ‘Fame India’ scheme, the ministry has announced Rs 1 crore subsidy for each bus, each costing around Rs 2 crore, by Centre.
 
 Lucknow will get 40 buses in the first lot of 20 airconditioned and 20 non-airconditioned ones.
 
  costs about Rs 2 crore while a non-AC costs Rs 1.9 crore. The charging infrastructure of each bus
 
 costs Rs 25 lakh.
 
 Of this too, 10% will be given by Centre as subsidy. In total, Lucknow will get Rs 40 crore subsidy for 40 electric buses from Centre while state government will give remaining Rs 44 crore.
 
 The ministry had sought proposals from different states and UP had sent names of Lucknow, Agra, Varanasi, Kanpur and Allahabad. Electric buses reduce noise and air pollution and are cheaper to operate.
 
 The buses will ply on city roads and will be taken care of by Lucknow City Transport Services Limited.
 
 Later, the department plans to give these buses to a private operator for operation and maintenance.
 
 A senior official said, “We still have to decide the fares.”
