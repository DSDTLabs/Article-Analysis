GURUGRAM: The department of town and country planning ( ) has failed to take any action against plot owners who have built illegal structures at   in Sector 54 even six months after detecting the unauthorised constructions and issuing notices to the offenders, alleged the township’s residents.

 According to the residents, the department had carried out a survey of the area in August-September last year following a complaint on the CM Window in this regard in July. 
 
 After the survey, the department had also issued notices to 37 plot owners who had made unauthorised construction beyond permissible limits and in violation of rules. The offenders were asked to submit revised building plans for the unauthorised structures.
 
 The department had even submitted its action taken report that is available on the CM Window. “A survey of the society (Suncity) has already been carried out by this office. And during the survey, it was noticed that (37) plot owners have made unauthorised construction in violation of the zoning regulations. Therefore, show cause notices were served by this office the offenders on September 8, 2017. In reference to the notices, the property owners had appeared for hearing in the DTCP office. (However) none of them has submitted the revised building plans till date,” states the report (a copy of which is with TOI). Vishwa Singh, general secretary, Suncity RWA, said, “Despite DTCP notice, none of the property owners has submitted a revised plan. Unauthorised construction is still going unchecked in the township.”
 
 Shockingly, DTCP has not taken any action against them yet. An DTPC official said, “We gave the licence to the coloniser. It is now their responsibility to check unauthorised constructions. However, after residents’ complaints, we sent notices to all the plots owners and strict action will be taken against those who don’t submit revised plans soon.”
