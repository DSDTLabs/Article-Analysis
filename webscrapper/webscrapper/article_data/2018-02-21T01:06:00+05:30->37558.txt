Madurai: Frustrated over the inordinate delay in registration process, ever since online registration of land and other documents was made mandatory in the state, around 200 document writers staged a demonstration on Tuesday.

 Led by president of Madurai District Document Writers Association, V R Ramamurthy and secretary, R Muruganandam, the demonstration was held in front of the registration offices on the Othakadai registrar office premises. 
 
 The document writers also decided to raise slogans against the government everyday for a period of five minutes before commencing work, from Wednesday, demanding the easing of the registration process. They also decided to stage a hunger strike in the coming days, said treasurer of the association, T S Naganathan. 
 
 Ever since the registration process was shifted to online from February 13, it became extremely slow and complicated, with each registration taking hours together.
 
 Naganathan alleged that most of the computers and hardware infrastructure created for registration department is 18 years old, when the department was computerised in 2001. Without upgrading systems, it is impossible to speed up the works and this in turn affects public and government, he rued.
