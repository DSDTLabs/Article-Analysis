PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A five-year-old boy was allegedly beaten up and inflicted   by his mother and stepfather in Ramnagar slums in Chinchwad on Tuesday evening because he had gone to his paternal aunt’s house without informing them.

 His mother, Komal Ashtule, and stepfather, Kishore Bansode, searched for Viraj Ashtule, but could not find him. When he returned, they beat him up with shoes and sticks, and burned him in places with burning paper. The boy was taken to Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation-run Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital in Pimpri for treatment on Wednesday.
 
 Savita Divate (40) of Patil Estate in Wakdewadi, an office-bearer of a social organization, has lodged a complaint with the Pimpri police station.
 
 Vivek Mugalikar, senior inspector of the Pimpri police, told TOI, “We have arrested the boy’s stepfather and booked his mother under Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Juvenile Justice Act.”
 
 Mugalikar said prima facie investigations revealed the boy’s mother had inflicted burn injuries with burning paper, while his father assaulted him with sticks and footwear, as the boy went out for playing without informing them. “The boy suffered minor burns and is being treated in the hospital,” he added.
 
 MM Deshmukh, superintendent, YCM hospital, said, “The boy was admitted in the afternoon. He does not have burn injuries. He was beaten and has marks on his body. He will be discharged in a few days.”
