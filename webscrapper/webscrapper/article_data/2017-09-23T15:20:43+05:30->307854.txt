One would imagine an ex-husband, especially someone who is rumoured to have been seeing someone else while in the marriage, would be invariably an enemy for life. But for Manju Warrier, cinema precedes personal enmity. The very same   who had suggested earlier that there is a criminal conspiracy behind the rape of the Malayalam actress, has now come out with a post asking asking people not to boycott  's film  !

 Both Ramaleela and Manju's own   are releasing on the same day, and Manju has put down her thoughts on the subject in a lengthy facebook post today. A film is not the output of one individual, and cinema is the livelihood of a lot of people, she writes. If you distance cinema from people there won't be producers to fund films and lots of dreams will break. Above all, the team behind a film will be fully satisfied only when a film is accepted by people, not just when it collects money. And so, boycotting a film and asking others not to watch it is an unforgivable sin, she concludes.
