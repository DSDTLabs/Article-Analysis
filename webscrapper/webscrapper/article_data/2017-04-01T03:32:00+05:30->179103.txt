Vasco: Citizens, visitors and others looking up at the heritage   in the busy market area of Vasco can now see the time piece ticking after many years. Those who know about its history are glad that the restoration project is drawing to a close, after years of neglect.

 The restored heritage clock tower in the port town will be inaugurated soon. The restoration was taken up by Rajaram and Tarabai Bandekar Charitable Trust in April 2015 and was to be completed by December.
 
 “The painting work is almost getting over and the handing over and inauguration will take place soon,” said the chief officer of MMC Deepali Naik.
 
 Heritage landmarks like this clock tower built in 1938 often suffer neglect and fade with time, as heritage lovers often complain. “We hope this restoration ticks off awareness about the importance of heritage assets and their maintenance,” said conservation architect, Ketak Nachinolkar.
 
 The clock had stopped ticking many years back and the tower itself showed signs of neglect due to to MMC’s apathy in taking up maintenance work. Monsoon leakage and commercial outlets that came up in the building had taken a toll on the tower.
 
 This tower is located on a municipal building in the heart of Vasco. Municipal records state that the Vasco market, built in 1938, is an example of Art Deco style of architecture. The central portion of the long side of the building is raised as a tower above the roofs and is mounted by a domical roof. The tower face on all four sides has clocks.
 
 The design of the octagonal-flanking smaller towers is reminiscent of the design of the Gateway of India in Mumbai which was designed by the British architect George Witter in 1914. This is inspired by historical Gujarati Islamic architecture style more prominent in mosques of the 14th and 15th centuries.
 
 The restoration has seen people of Vasco taking to social media to appreciate the municipality and the trust which took up the project.
