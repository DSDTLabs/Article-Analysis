CHENNAI: Late Tamil Nadu chief minister J   Deepa Jayakumar on Tuesday night met chief minister O Pannerselvam at her aunt's memorial on the Marina Beach here and said, "My political journey begins today." 

 After the meeting, Deepa told mediapersons that Panneerselvam and she would work like "two arms of AIADMK."
 
 Deepa, who had earlier welcomed the Supreme Court verdict upholding the conviction of AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala and her family members in the disproportionate assets case, said on Tuesday night, "They (Sasikala and others) are going to, where they have to."
 
 Earlier in the day, Deepa told reporters that she was always saying that Sasikala would not be accepted as leader of the party, primarily because she had impending verdict in the assets case.
 
 "People also welcome the verdict as they do not want to see Sasikala to lead them and against her," she said, adding that Jayalalithaa disliked her close aide from taking positions in the party. However, the dominance of Sasikala in the party had many of her supporters gaining party posts, and many relieved according to her whims.
 
 "Our Amma (Jayalalithaa) did not like them (Sasikala clan) at all. None has any second thought about it. Sasikala had brought harm to the leader, and cheated her only to gain power and money. The court verdict has put an end to this," she said. tnn
