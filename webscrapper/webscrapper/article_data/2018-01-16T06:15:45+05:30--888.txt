CHENNAI: Caught unawares by a large influx of visitors on Monday, officials at the Vandalur   were forced to close several enclosures and seek reinforcements from the police and other forest divisions to manage the surging crowds. 

 "We expected a large   to visit the zoo only on Kaanum   which falls on Tuesday. But, to our surprise, a large number of visitors arrived a day earlier," said a senior wildlife official.
 
 "Even on a weekend, not more than 1,500 visitors come to the zoo. But, this year, more than 5,000 visitors turned up by 11am and the number rose to nearly 30,000 by the end of the day," the official said.
 
 He said the serpentarium, Malabar giant squirrel house and nocturnal animal house were off-limits to visitors. "These enclosures are small and narrow, leading to the possibility of a stampede if there is a large crowd. In order to avoid any untoward incident, they were closed," he added.
 
 Zoo authorities said the three enclosures will remain out of bounds on Tuesday, along with the aquarium and gharial enclosure.
 
 Following the spurt in the number of visitors, zoo officials requested help from the local police who sent 25 policemen. Around 100 staffers from other forest divisions also landed at the zoo to assist officials. 
 
 C   from  , who visited the zoo with four family members, said, "We booked our tickets online. Officials said the van service for the safaris was closed at 1pm, which was a disappointment. The facilities at the zoo are very good."
 
 Visitors also thronged the Children's Park in large numbers on Monday, with authorities putting the count at more than 11,500. The awareness centre was shut since it's not big enough to host a large crowd, said officials. "The centre will remain closed till the Pongal holidays are over," said an official.
