Gandhinagar: Congress MLAs and the office-bearers of the party will meet on January 3 at the party headquarters in Ahmedabad to elect the leader of opposition in the newly elected Gujarat assembly. After the meeting, the party may finalize the name which is likely to be declared from New Delhi.

 According to a senior Congress leader, the party will consider all aspects, including the caste factor, for reaching to any conclusion. “The party will also consider the fact that the Lok Sabha polls is scheduled in 2019 and the LOP must be acceptable to all sections of society. The LOP candidates may be from the Patidar, OBCs and the STs. From the Patidar MLAs, Paresh Dhanani and Virji Thumar and from OBCs, Kuvarji Bavaliya, Punja Vansh, Jawahar Chavda, Vikram Madam and Alpesh Thakor are in the race. Ashwin Kotwal and Mohansinh Rathwa are key ST contenders,” he said.
 
 The meeting will be conducted by state party in-charge Ashok Gehlot and state party president Bharatsinh Solanki. After taking feedback from the MLAs and the office-bearers, Gehlot is likely to talk to All India Congress president Rahul Gandhi for the final decision.
 
 After former leader of opposition Shankersinh Vaghela rebelled against the party, the Congress had appointed Mohansinh Rathwa as the LOP.
