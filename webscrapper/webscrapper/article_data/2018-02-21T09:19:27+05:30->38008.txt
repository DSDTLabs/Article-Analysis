HYDERABAD: At a time when the Union home ministry is getting ready to hold a meeting of the chief secretaries of the two Telugu states to resolve pending issues stemming from bifurcation, an order issued by the Andhra Pradesh has triggered a fresh controversy.

 On knowing of this order, Telangana chief secretary   held a meeting with officials and decided to express their displeasure over their move. They have decided to write a letter to the AP chief secretary on the issue.
 
 Officials said division of many institutions listed in Schedule IX and X have not been completed for the past three-and-half years. The Centre has appointed a committee headed by   to finalize the assets, but the exercise has not been completed. 
 
 The Union home ministry was supposed to hold a meeting on February 21 with the chief secretaries of both the states to resolve the issues of bifurcation and Schedule 13 of the AP Reorganization Act. The Schedule 13 talks about the promises made, such as setting up of institutions, projects and other issues.
