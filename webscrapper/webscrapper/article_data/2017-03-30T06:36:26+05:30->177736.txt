AHMEDABAD: Gone are the days when the libraries were limited to books, as the city’s   is set to establish a library of building materials, in a bid to better expose students before they enter the world of architecture.

 The material library will be set up at the new workshop, which is coming up as part of the university’s expansion plan, by the end of June. The materials on show will be conventional materials, natural materials and composite materials, said officials at CEPT, adding that they have started collecting natural materials and students will be able to access the library by August.
 
 “We will show all building materials in physical form, which will help students to choose materials for their buildings. If students are exposed to materials, it will help them visualize and translate ideas into reality quickly,”  , workshop director at CEPT, told TOI.
 
 “If students know the materials, they will know how they can be used and in what climates. Knowing all the aspects of building materials will come handy for students, because they can get direct exposure to them,” added Sheth.
 
 She said all materials will be barcoded and a library catalogue will be made available. The students can issue materials on their smart cards. “Students can also access the material catalogue online and check what material is available and what is not. The students can also check the properties and behaviour of each material,” she said.
