 is that song from the film  , directed by Bejoy Nambiar, that will stick to your mind for a long time. As the Malayalam and Tamil audience wait for the release of the film, which has   and actresses Sai Dhanshika, Neha Sharma, Arthi Venkatesh and Sruthi Hariharan. By the looks of the videos and songs unveiling the segments of Siva, Shekhar, Ridra and Trilok, one can expect some amazing performances coming from each one of them. 

 It was earlier posted on social media that the gang, which comes out with the best lip-syncing video of the song, will have themselves featured in the fan version, which will be launched by Dulquer. And, interestingly, Dulquer and Bejoy also tried it out. 
 
 The video looks full of fun.
