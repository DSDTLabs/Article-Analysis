CHENNAI: The sudden blazes at the tree dumping yards could have been avoided had the corporation managed the green debris better rather than dumping them at landfills, said experts.

 “Every city gets its share of horticulture waste,” said Dharmesh  , climate policy analyst for   for Incinerator Alternatives. “The ideal way to deal with this would have been to bring shredding machines in every ward or zone, shred the bulky horticulture waste and compost it. This waste is rich in manure and could have been used for trees, gardens or in places like Semmozhi Poonga. Though corporation has managed the logs well, they haven’t been able to handle a large quantity of green waste,” he said.
 
 With the trees being auctioned or taken away as firewood, the dry leaves and twigs, which are the major problem now, remain. “When it mixes with food waste and other garbage, methane is formed. This increases the possibility of fire,” said Shah. “We do not have the infrastructure to prepare for horticulture waste. We dump everything in landfills.”
 
 But, it may not be too late, said retired deputy director of Tamil Nadu Agriculture department G  . “The dry leaves can be composted if they are not contaminated with urban waste,” he said. 
 
 Ramakrishnan said the leaves can be put together in a pit, mixed with pseudomonas fungus, covered by soil and moistened frequently to get compost in less than three months. “There are several such techniques and the corporation can market the compost at a reasonable cost,” he said.
