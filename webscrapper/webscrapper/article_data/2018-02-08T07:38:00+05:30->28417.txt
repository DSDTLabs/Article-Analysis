INDORE:   of Indore has instructed   not to register vehicles with less than 12+1 seating capacity as school vehicles. 

 This comes after district administration restricted such vehicles from ferrying school kids following death of five people including four school students of Delhi Public School in a road accident on January 5. 
 
 Jitendra Singh Raghuvanshi, regional transport officer (Indore) said that from now vehicles such as Tata Magic, Maruti Vans and auto-rickshaws will not be registered as school vehicles. “The administration has already restricted these vehicles from ferrying school kids. This restriction has been put in place as per the guidelines of Supreme Court. Only buses are now allowed to ferry schoolchildren,” he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, some of the owners of such vehicles who have already purchased the vehicles and got them registered as school vehicles are planning to approach the transport department authorities as they will not be able to use these vehicles. 
 
 There are around 4000 Tata magic and Maruti vans engaged in ferrying school students. This includes around 600 Tata magic vans. Most of them do not have commercial permit and were being used as school vehicles. 
 
 Tata and magic van operators had also raised an objection on administration’s action. They were demanding regular permit for their vehicles, but the administration denied. 
 
 They have been allowed to ferry passengers in city, but have been restricted from ferrying school going kids to and from school. 
 
 Transport department officials said that they have already started seizing such vehicles which are still being used for carrying school children and are also cancelling registrations of such vehicles.
