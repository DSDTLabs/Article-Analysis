CHANDIGARH: Moving the   on Monday against his conviction in rape cases,   (DSS) head Gurmeet   Singh has submitted that the prosecution (CBI) had not conducted his potency test. Ram Rahim had claimed before the trial court that he is not virile since 1990 --- much prior to allegations of rape being levelled against him by Sadhvis.

 "The prosecution did not get the medical examination of the accused-appellant done to prove that he was capable of performing sexually. The finding of trial court that the plea of about his incapacity after 1990 is not substantiated because of his two daughters is totally erroneous. The trial court has presumed that because he is father of two children therefore his plea was not correct without ascertaining the age of his two children, especially when the plea of accused-appellant recorded under Section 313 is after a year," Ram Rahim's counsel has submitted before the HC in his appeal.
 
 The dera chief seeks directions to set aside the August 25 order through which he was convicted of raping two   and the August 28 order sentencing him.
