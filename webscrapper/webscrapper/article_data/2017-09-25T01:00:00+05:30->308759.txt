The first look motion poster of  , starring   and   in the lead, has kindled the curiosity of fans. While it’s known that Gautham plays a college student and Vijay Sethupathi, a tribal leader, the latter’s look in the film has got many intrigued. 

 Debutant director   says, “Many have been asking me why Vijay Sethupathi’s called Yaman. In villages, people who consider Karuppasamy as their deity name their kids  . Similarly, the tribals in the film consider Yamadarumaraja as their kuladeivam and hence, they call their leader Yaman. We’ve worked a lot on Vijay Sethupathi’s look; we’d sketched a lot of looks and discarded so many of them before zeroing in on this one. Interestingly, in every scene, he will be sporting a different look. In fact, Vijay Sethupathi would send me pictures of himself in various wigs and ask me if any of those worked.”
 
 The director is all praise for his lead actors. “What happens when a city-bred youngster finds himself amidst tribal folks? Will a tribal man be able to survive in a city? This is what the film attempts to find out. Gautham was very comfortable to work with; he was eager to attempt new things and would always deliver more than what is expected of him. We would always have full-fledged discussions before every scene and only after we were convinced would we go ahead with the shoot. Neither of them made me feel like a newcomer; they are a director’s delight.”
