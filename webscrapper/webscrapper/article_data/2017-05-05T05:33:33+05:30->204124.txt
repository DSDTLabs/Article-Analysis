CHENNAI: A six-man gang hijacked a truck carrying 26 barrels of   worth Rs2 crore in a daring  , after attacking the driver and an armed   accompanying him, near   on  

 The city police said Malladi Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd, near Ranipet, owned the medicines. Sekar, the driver, and an armed security guard, Venkatesan, were transporting the medicines from the company’s production facility in Ranipet, Vellore, to the company’s office in Alandur when the gang commandeered the vehicle.
 
 When the vehicle arrived at the Sunguvarchatram bypass on the Bengaluru-Chennai highway, an investigating officer said, a gang of six men who had apparently followed the truck in an SUV, intercepted the truck.
 
 “Members of the gang posed as government officials and asked the driver for permits for the cargo,” the officer said. “While the driver was searching for the documents in the back of the vehicle, they attacked the guard, who was carrying a rifle, and overpowered him.”
 
 “When the driver returned, they beat him up too,” he said. “They pushed the driver and guard to the side of the highway and made away with the truck.”
 
 The gang abandoned the vehicle near Mappedu village, around 10km from the spot of the hijacking, after taking away its cargo.
 
 “The gang, we suspect, used another truck to move the cargo,” the officer said. “We have retrieved some footage from security cameras on the stretch and hope it will help us identity the culprits.”
 
 Kancheepuram SP Santhosh Hadimani supervised the crime scene investigation.
