JAMMU: Aijaz Ahmad Mir, the PDP   from Wachi, stirred a political storm on Thursday when he referred to slain terrorists as “martyrs” and said that the Centre-appointed interlocutor to Jammu & Kashmir should hold talks with the Hurriyat and terrorists to resolve the Kashmir issue.

 Mir, while addressing reporters outside the legislative assembly, said, “Jo Kashmir ke hain, chahey kisi bhi halat mein marein, woh martyr hain (Those who hail from Kashmir are martyrs, irrespective of circumstances under which they get killed).”
 
 He also asserted that Kashmir is a political issue, which could be resolved with dialogue. “I feel that interlocutor ( ) should hold talks with Hurriyat and also the terrorists… People have different opinions about the terrorists like how many of them are killed. But, where do they (terrorists) come from... they are residents of J&K,” he said.
 
 Referring to ‘Operation All Out’, where 200 militants were killed, Mir said, “We beat the drum about eliminating 200 terrorists but how long will this process continue? It has to stop somewhere.” The statement left the party’s ally —   — red-faced, which condemned it as “absolutely intolerable.” Reacting to the controversy, BJP MLA   said, “No one can describe a slain militant as martyr. If a sitting MLA has said it, it certainly calls for an enquiry.”
 
 BJP MLA from Nowshera, Ravinder Raina, said glorifying terrorists is like playing with fire and he will take up the matter with the speaker and also ask Chief Minister   to reprimand her legislator for such a “sensational” statement.
