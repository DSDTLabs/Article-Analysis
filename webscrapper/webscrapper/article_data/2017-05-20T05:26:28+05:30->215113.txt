CHENNAI: The Union   is likely to establish an All India Institute of   (AIIMS) in   by the year-end, state health minister   said here on Friday.

 After inaugurating facilities for the newborn at Institute of Child Health in Kilpauk, Vijayabaskar said, “Union health minister J P Nadda has told me that the hospital will be established by the year-end. I am hopeful [that the state will have an AIIMS campus by then].”
 
 The Centre in the Union Budget for 2015-16 made the announcement that it would set up an AIIMS campus in Tamil Nadu.
 
 The state government drew up a list of five possible locations — Chengalpet in Kancheepuram district, Pudukkottai city in Pudukkottai district, Sengipatti in   of Thanjavur district, Perundhurai in Erode district, and Thoppur in Madurai district — for the AIIMS campus.
 
 A committee of experts from the Centre had in 2016 visited each of these places. Though officials seemed most impressed with Sengipatti as a location for the proposed institute and hospital, the Union health ministry on March 7 sought for more information on each of the five suggested sites.
 
 Former chief minister J Jayalalithaa had dispatched a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking his intervention to ensure that the Centre speedily set up the facility.
 
 In Jayalalithaa’s letter to Modi in February 2016, she requested that the Prime Minister directed the officials concerned to act with urgency to set up the AIIMS campus in Tamil Nadu so people of the state could benefit from an advanced medical facility and have access to state-of-the-art medical facilities and healthcare.
 
 Health secretary J Radhakrishnan said the state government had submitted all the information required to the Centre and a parliamentary committee.
