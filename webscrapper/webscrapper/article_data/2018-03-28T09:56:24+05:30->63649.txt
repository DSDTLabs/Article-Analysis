CHANDIGARH: The UT administration's first round of auctioning liquor vends began on a dramatic note on Tuesday. Though the UT received 166 bids for 79 of its 93 liquor vends, the entire process was hijacked by an unhappy bidder for nearly four hours. 

 The bidding process was still on when this story was filed late on Tuesday night. The bidder, whose name could not be verified, had reportedly filed bids for 16 vends. However, when the process was still underway, he intervened and kept requesting UT officials for four hours to allow him to change his bids in two forms. 
 
 Though he kept on pressing officials, they did not allow him to change his bids. With the administration not getting any bids for 14 of its vends, it will now hold a second round of bidding. The commotion caused by the bidder delayed the process.
 
 As the auction process was still on when this story was filed, the highest and lowest bids could not ascertained. 
 
 Though the UT has slightly increased licence fee, excise duty and other fee, liquor continues to be the cheapest in Tricity. According to sources, a bottle of Blender Pride will cost around Rs 620 in Chandigarh from April 1, while people will have to pay around Rs 650 in   and Mohali. Bacardi Rum will be available at around Rs 530 in Chandigarh, Rs 650 in   and Rs 680 in Panchkula. A bottle of Signature will be available at around Rs 650 in Chandigarh, Rs 660 in Mohali and Rs 680 in Panchkula.
 
 The department has increased the number of vends from 77 kept on auction last year to 93 this time around. There has been little increase in the reserve price of all old vends. The reserve price of new vends is substantially higher than the old ones.
 
 The reserve price of three vends is higher than Rs 5 crore - Sector 30 market (Rs 5.05cr), Sector 42 market (Rs 5cr), and   village (Rs 5cr).
