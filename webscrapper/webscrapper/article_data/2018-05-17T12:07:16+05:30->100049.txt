CHANDIGARH: PGI has postponed the foundation stone laying ceremony for its new advanced neurosciences centre after the authorities failed to receive confirmation of the scheduled visit of union minister of health and family welfare, J P  , on the occassion. The minister, along with local dignitaries including the adviser, home secretary, finance secretary and the member of parliament, was in the list for attending the ceremony. The PGI officials were intimated about his participation before   election results.

 However, it seemed that due to the minister’s political engagements after the poll results in Karnataka, the health ministry could not confirm his presence at the ceremony which was scheduled on Thursday 11am.
 
 “Media interaction was also slotted after the ceremony. But till now, we have not received any confirmation,” said PGI director Dr Jagat Ram.
 
 Sources said the ceremony will be postponed in absence of Nadda as he had shown his interest in laying the foundation stone of the new centre. “Cards have been prepared and the PGI was about to send invites to the guests. But now, it has been held back in absence of confirmation,” said an official.
 
 On June 15, after BJP fell short of majority in Karnataka assembly elections, J P Nadda along with other senior party leaders were asked by the BJP parliamentary board to attend a meeting of the newly-elected BJP MLAs as the party’s central observers.
 
 Advanced neurosciences centre, which will have 300 beds, is a Rs 495.31 crore project. It will cater to the patients suffering with neurological diseases and disorders. It will house facilities like brain suite, mapping, invasive neurophysiological techniques and advanced imaging technology. The centre shall come up near a market adjacent to the school for public health. 
 
 The PGI authorities were constantly in touch with officials in the health ministry, but failed to get confirmation about the minister’s visit.
