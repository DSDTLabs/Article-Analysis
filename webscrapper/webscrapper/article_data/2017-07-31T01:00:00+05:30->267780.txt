Even though   had a short role to play in  , it was quite a memorable one. As for his next, the actor has signed  , which is being directed by  . 

 Talking about his role, Vatsan says, “I play a jobless, but an arrogant guy who doesn’t mind showing off his muscles. The movie also stars  , Karunakaran and Venkat Prabhu. The story revolves around three guys — Kalai, newcomer Gautham and I. What happens to these boys forms the crux of the story.” 
 
 Interestingly, Vatsan and director Murali had worked together for a 40-minute pilot film three years ago. But the journey has not been easy for the Chennai lad, who confesses that it was a struggle to find a place in the industry. He says, “I was 18 when I did Engaeyum Eppothum. The film did well and it was declared a hit. But at that time, I had no clue what a hit movie is or what happens when a movie fails at the BO. Now, I realise the importance of a hit and how much an actor should cherish it. The last few years in the industry have been a great learning experience for me. I made a few wrong choices and people are always there to only misguide you. They do all the damage and act as though they don’t even know you. I completely blame myself for all this. I was naive and blindly trusted several people. But slowly, I understood how the industry functions. I started working out and focusing on my physical transformation. Having worked in a few films, I guess I have now learnt how to choose scripts and whom to trust.”
