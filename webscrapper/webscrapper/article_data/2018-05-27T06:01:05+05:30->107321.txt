PANCHKULA: Despite having Psoriasis (a skin disease),  , a humanities student and resident of Panchkula, Sector 7, scored 86.4% in class XII. The achievement is doubly significant, considering that the skin ailment left him unable to attend school regularly from the age of six.

 Varun said he took notes from his schoolmates and studied at home for the most part. Sometimes, he said, his parents asked him to leave school but he was determined to deliver a great performance.
 
 Varun, a student of Bhavan School, Panchkula, says his teachers and parents always motivated him to realise his dreams. “I used to go to school when my skin allowed me to. It was hard for me,” he said.
