SURAT: Partially decomposed head of a calf in Godadara locality of Limbayat, Surat created tension in eastern parts of the city early on Monday. A road side butcher shop was torched by rioters and stones were pelted on shops and police teams. At least 40 tear-gas shells were lobbed by police to control the rioters.

 Earlier, local residents including some individuals belonging to notorious saffron groups carried the calf head attached till ribcage in a cart and roamed around the area. They also staged a dharna claiming that the calf was killed by butchers and the head was thrown in a public place to insult sentiments of other community. 
 
 However, police sources informed that the calf head was not chopped by butchers since it was attached to ribcage. Police suspect that the calf dead body could have been thrown by some cattle breeder after it died. It could have been dragged upto the road by dogs. 
 
 Police have resorted to lathi charge and lobbed tear-gas shells. Over 50 people were arrested by police for rioting. Police installed heavy bandobast in the area and the situation was brought under control.
