CHANDIGARH: A day before the   (UPSC) was to hold a meeting for elevation of 32 Haryana Civil Service (HCS) officers to the IAS cadre, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday issued it (UPSC) notice, seeking its response on plea challenging the elevation process.

 The matter has reached the HC in the wake of a petition filed by   Shahbad, an HCS officer presently posted as managing director (MD), Cooperative Sugar Mill, Shahbad in Kurukshetra district. In his plea, Sujan Singh has sought directions to consider the vacancies and select list of the year 2017 in a meeting scheduled to be held on Thursday. In its meeting, UPSC is only considering the vacancies and select list from 2012 to 2016 of the HCS officers for elevation as IAS officer.
 
 The petitioner has mainly asked the HC to restrain the UPSC from holding the meeting for selection schedule to be held on March 22, 2018 and to determine the vacancies arisen in 2017 and to consider the same in the next meeting of the selection committee. According to him, he had approached the Chandigarh bench of   (CAT) but the matter was adjourned by the tribunal. He has submitted that if the meeting is held on Thursday, it would cause irreparable loss to him.
 
 In support of his arguments, the state civil service officer has also produced a Union government communication through which the Haryana government was asked to prepare selection list and determination of number of vacancies in the promotion quota of IAS that has arisen between January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 and further requested to submit the proposal by January 10, 2018 so that meeting of the selection committee could be scheduled earlier.
 
 The petitioner submitted that he had given representations to the Centre as well as the state in January and in February for considering the 2017 list but it raises doubt as to what circumstances have arisen to fix the meeting of the selection committee on March 22, 2018 without including the vacancies and select list of 2017.
