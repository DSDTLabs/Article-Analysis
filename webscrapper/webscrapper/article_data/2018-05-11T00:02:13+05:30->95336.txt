Thiruvananthapuram: Following the heavy summer rain that lashed the city, Kerala Water Authority (KWA) has temporarily opened one of the shutters of Aruvikkara   on Thursday. It was opened at a height of 10 cm to release the water from the reservoir as the level touched the brim. It was closed by evening.

 The city recorded 7cm rain on Wednesday. The capacity of   dam has reduced to a considerable level due to desiltation. Water authority officials clarified that they were forced to open the shutter, following continuous rainfall, to flush out turbid water.
 
 Meanwhile, the irrigation department broke the sandbar at Poonthura and Veli, following concerns over water level rising in canals and rivers in the city. Veli sandbar was broke opened to discharge water in Veli backwater that came from Ulloor, Pattom and Pazhavangadi canals. Breaking of Poonthura sandbar is expected to help reduce water level in Karamana-Killi rivers.
 
 Premchand, assistant engineer of Irrigation department, said it was difficult to break the sandbar at Veli as it was done after an interval of around 3 months. “Since there was no rain for the past few months, the sandbar grew thicker,” he said. He added that various factors, including high or low tide condition, have to be assessed before breaking sandbars.
 
  The water level at Peppara too has increased to 101.5 metres following the rainfall.
