NEW DELHI: Another case of an ATM dispensing fake Rs 2,000 notes with Children’s Bank of India printed on them has surfaced near   in south Delhi. A youth, Chandan Rai, who had gone to withdraw money from an ICICI ATM near Sheetla Mata Mandir, Garhi on March 3 got a shock when he received such notes.

 This incident comes shortly after a cash custodian was arrested for putting in similar fake Rs 2,000 notes in an SBI ATM at Sangam Vihar. The case has been transferred to the Crime Branch for investigating the source of the notes. The fake cash has been sent for forensic analysis and the ATM has been sealed. Bank officials have also been asked to join the probe.
 
 Police said the notes resemble the bills that were dispensed by the Sangam Vihar ATM. Cops suspect that an organised gang is involved in circulating the notes with the help of a few employees of the cash delivery companies.
 
 “Rai, who works at a private company, said that he checked the notes after withdrawing them as he had read about   being in circulation in newspapers,” said DCP (southeast) Romil Baaniya.
 
 The youth found that the notes had Rs 2,000 printed in the same font as the original currency, but they had “Children’s Bank of India” in place of RBI and “Churan Patti” written in place of the watermark. The notes even bore a pledge that said “I promise to pay the bearer a slip of Rs 2,000.” The notes had serial number 000000 on them.
 
 The CCTV footage of the ATM is being scanned by the police to check who had last filled cash in the machine.
 
 Cops will also question Mohammad Isha, the cash custodian who had been arrested earlier for placing the   in the Sangam Vihar ATM. Isha is currently out on bail. Police have detained a few others who they suspect to having supplied him with the notes. A case for circulating fake currency notes has been registered.
