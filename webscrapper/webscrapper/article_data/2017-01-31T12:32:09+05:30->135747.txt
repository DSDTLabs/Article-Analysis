UDUPI: Demanding written guidelines for paryaya, former junior   of Pejawar Mutt, Sri Vishwa Vijaya has filed a case against the ‘ashtamutts’ in the Udupi   on Monday.

 The petition was filed by advocate K S N Rajesh. Sri Vishwa Vijaya urged for a written law for the smooth functioning of the paryaya. The copy states that, in order to maintain sanctity and unity among the seers of the ashtamutt, written guidelines are a must. During paryaya, the puja and administration of Krishna Math is handed over to one of the swamijis of one of the ashtamutt to the swamiji of another mutt. Currently rituals and customs are being changed according to the wishes of the paryaya swamiji, the petition stated. During festivals this creates misunderstanding among the peetadhipathis and spoils the image of Madhvacharya, who is the founder of ashtamutts.
 
 On January 4, 2016, Sri Vishwa Vijaya had sent a legal notice to all the eight mutts to form a written constitution with bylaws but no one responded compelling Sri Vishwa Vijaya to file a lawsuit.
 
 Responding to the suit, Sri Vishwesha Thirtha Swamiji of Pejawar mutt said, “Vishwa Vijaya Junior swami wants a guide for the future. The requirement was there from a long time. I did not get the notice from the court. Once I do, I will have a talk with all heads of seers and do the needful.”
