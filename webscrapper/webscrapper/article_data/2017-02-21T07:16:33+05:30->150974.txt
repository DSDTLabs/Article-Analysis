 The decision was taken during a recent workshop aimed to acquaint forest and environment department officials with the effects of climate change.
 
 The action plan guidelines had been framed in 2014, and three years later, the environment department and forest department will be integrating the vulnerability assessment from these findings into their plan for Maharashtra. The day-long workshop was organised by the two departments and Action on Climate Today — Innovation Program.
 
 Speaking about the same, additional chief secretary — environment   said, “The Department for International Development (DFID) India – an arm of the UK government, and the department of environment have created modules for six states to make the action plans of various government departments to be climate change-adaptive and resilient.”
 
 The module for forest and environment departments was presented before their senior officers. “Based on this, the officers gave inputs on what more is needed to make the action plan of the forest department ‘climate change-proof’. The core premise of the workshop is adapting to the inevitable reality of climate change,” he added. The findings from the workshop will be compiled in a week, Gavai said.
 
 As many as 30 senior officers of the forest department, along with the secretary – forests, as well as various NGOs involved in forest and environment conservation participated at the event. When asked about the future, Gavai told TOI that similar workshops would also be held for various other departments including industry, agriculture and others to sensitise them and integrate the climate action plan into their functions as well over coming months.
