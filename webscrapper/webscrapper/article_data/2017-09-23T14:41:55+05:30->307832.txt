 recently faced criticism for uploading the "all-male" picture to celebrate one year anniversary of ' ', but  , who was one of the female leads in the movie, believes the megastar did not exclude them intentionally. 

 To mark the one year of 'Pink' Bachchan, 74, uploaded an all-male crew picture, with many people pointing out the irony. 
 
  
  
 "I 100 per cent know he probably wouldn't have done it intentionally. It's not possible that he deliberately chose a picture in which we weren't there. In fact in all the award functions, after receiving the award he used to always mention 'I want to thank the three girls for this film',"   said in an interview. 
 
 "I don't think it was intentional at all. It might have been that it skipped (his mind) or he didn't realise or something. I don't think it was intentional from his side to exclude girls," she added. 
 
 'Pink' released last year in September and garnered rave reviews. 
 
 The film, which featured Bachchan as a lawyer defending three girls, played by Taapsee, Kriti Kulhari and Andrea Tariang, also bagged the National Award for Best Film on Social Issues. 
 
 Directed by Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury, the court room drama also featured Angad Bedi in a pivotal role. 
 
 Post 'Pink', Taapsee had three Hindi releases this year- 'Running Shaadi', 'The Ghazi Attacks' and 'Naam Shabana'. 
 
 She is currently awaiting the release of her next, 'Judwaa 2' which stars Varun Dhawan and Jacqueline Fernandez.
