AHMEDABAD: Crime branch police inspector and the investigator of the sedition case against Patidar leader  ,   got a massive reprieve from Gujarat high court in a corruption case, because of the absence of state government sanction to prosecute him. Justice Z K Saiyed quashed a special anti-corruption court’s decision to prosecute Geddam on charges of corruption. The high court junked the case against the cop on two grounds – there was no prior approval from the government to prosecute him and that anti-corruption bureau (ACB) claimed it did not find substantial evidence against him. Geddam was booked for corruption in 2004, when he was a PSI at Maninagar, after a subordinate, an unarmed police constable Sachin Patel – was nabbed accepting a bribe of Rs 1,500 from one Hussain Shaikh. During investigation, the constable stated that he accepted the money at the behest of Geddam, for letting Shaikh’s brother run a hotel in the area.

 ACB director, however, did not find the evidence against Geddam substantive and asked the investigator to file an ‘A’ summary in the case of Geddam. The summary report was accepted by the special court in 2005. The complainant questioned Geddam’s being let off from the case before a higher court.
