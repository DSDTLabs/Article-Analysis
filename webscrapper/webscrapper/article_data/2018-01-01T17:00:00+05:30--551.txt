   This year, the actor has moved on to other films, like the trilingual 'Saaho' with  , but he fondly reminisces the five years that he spent living as Bahubali. “Walking into such a grand set every day is exciting for an actor. I was part of a great wonder, so the experience didn’t ever exhaust me. It’s just in the last one month of the shoot that I felt that I should do something else. I told Raja also that I wanted to do something else now,” he says. In the same breath, he adds, “During the first part, the pressure was far more, as we didn’t know how the Hindi-speaking audience would react to it. The Tamil and the Malayalam audience are slightly different, so when it worked with the Hindi audience, we were shocked. But   made a universal film, so that made a huge difference. His vision is larger than what you can even imagine. Someone like   backing the film also helped a lot. Initially, we wanted to make part one and two together, but then Raja thought that the script was becoming too long, and he wanted to focus on many characters like Kattappa, Devasena, Shivamani and Avantika. Of course, the question — Why Kattappa killed Bahubali — kept the audience engaged for a year.”    About 'Saaho', he adds, “Our director (Sujeeth) was very keen to have Shraddha on board. When he discussed it with the producers and all of us in the team, everyone felt that Shraddha is perfect for the role and luckily, she accepted the film.”
