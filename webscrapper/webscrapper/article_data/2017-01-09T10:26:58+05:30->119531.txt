THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Despite assurance from social justice minister that   (PH) candidates will be given priority (PH) in government jobs, nothing has changed on the ground. The PH candidates have now approached the chief minister seeking his intervention. 

 Though the state government has extended the term of expiry of the   (KPSC) rank list till June 30, the PH candidates are concerned that any further delay will have an impact on their postings as many had been waiting for over two years. 
 
 Few days back, K Madhu, a PH candidate, had urged chief minister   to ensure justice to PH candidates in job reservation based on a   directive. He had earlier written to the chief minister on October 10 last year indicating that PH candidates were ignored by the government over the years despite the apex court and high court ruling in their favour. A native of Thrissur and a post graduate from  , Madhu has been awaiting his posting after his name figured in the KPSC rank list two years ago for the deputy collector's post in land revenue department.
 
 When contacted, state law secretary BG Rabindranath told TOI that the state service rules need to be amended to ensure reservation for PH candidates. "A decision has to come from the social justice department," he said. 
 
 SJD secretary Mini Antony said she has taken charge as the new secretary of SJD only recently and is yet to study the file.
