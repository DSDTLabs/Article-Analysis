BENGALURU: The state assembly secretariat's decision to wrest control of the maintenance of Suvarna Soudha in  , Legislators' Home (LH) in Bengaluru and development of the legislators' club and township has drawn flak from various quarters.

 In an order issued on Wednesday, assembly speaker K B Koliwad divested the control of the public works department (PWD) over these structures. The development and maintenance of Suvarna Soudha, LH (Belagavi), and drivers' quarters in Lalbagh Siddapura and Crescent Road will also be handled by the secretariat. It has already identified 2.2 acres behind Kumara Krupa Guest House to be developed into a club for legislators on the lines of the Constitution Club of India in New Delhi, and is scouting for 50 acres of government land in Bengaluru for developing the township. The order allows the secre tariat to outsource all civil and electrical works to private contractors and manage grants from the finance department.
 
 An upset ex-speaker Kagodu Thimmappa said: “I had earlier opposed this idea but they have still gone ahead with it. I don't know what prompted them to do so. I feel the secretariat's job is not to handle civil works but only to ensure conduct of the session. I will take it up with the authority." Senior BJP leader S Suresh Kumar posted a sarcastic tweet calling the secretariat 'Karnataka Legislature Township'.“Do we need an assembly which involves in real estate business. When we have so much of work to do, why get into real estate?" he wrote.
 
  secretary  , however, said many states and the Parliament have already set a precedent by taking control of its assets.
