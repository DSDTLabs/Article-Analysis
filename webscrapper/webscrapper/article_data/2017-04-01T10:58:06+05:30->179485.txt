The college houses 27 different species of teak trees. The management recently decided to axe the trees as the roots were becoming a problem for the foundation of the building.
 However, the students foiled the plan. Speaking to HT, Somu Muttanavar, a student, says, “The trees increase the beauty of our college and keep the temperature down. The roots cannot disturb the college building because the roots enter the depths of the soil and do not stretch, like those of a banyan tree. This is just a lame excuse by the management. We will only permit them to chop the trees if they promise to plant a hundred saplings in the college premises."
 Another student, Guruprasad, adds, “The college has a number of other problems, but they only chose to concentrate on the trees, which are not even near the buildings. If the management decides to go ahead with the plan to chop the trees, it will be held responsible for all the events that unveil after that in the college."
 SV  , the principal of the college says, “It is good to see that the students of the college are nature lovers. But we have taken permission from the forest department and our management will take a positive decision in this regard.”
