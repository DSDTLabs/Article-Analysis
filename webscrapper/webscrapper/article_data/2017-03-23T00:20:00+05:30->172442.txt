Pune: Cab aggregator, Uber, said it has launched its ride sharing service uberPOOL in Pune.

 With the launch, Pune has become the seventh city in India to get the service. People will now be able to share a ride with others who are going in the same direction as they are. 
 
 Uber said, in the cities where it has launched the service, at least a fifth of all its customers are using the “pool” service.
 
 “Shared rides are up to 50% cheaper than travelling solo on uberGO, irrespective of the destination and adds just a couple of minutes to the total ride time,” the company said in a statement.
 
 For example, the company said, a ride between Magarpatta City to the railway station that costs Rs 147 on Ubergo will cost Rs 80 only if a commuter chooses uberPOOL.
 
 According to the map provided by Uber, the company covers the pool option in most parts of central Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, but leaves out areas like Bhosari, Katraj, Dhayari, Wagholi, among others. Also, the company said that a rider can book a maximum of 2 seats per pick up.
 
 Last year, Uber’s competitor, Ola had launched a similar service called OLA Share.
