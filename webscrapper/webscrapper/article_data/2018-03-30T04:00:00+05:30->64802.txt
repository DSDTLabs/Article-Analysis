Surat: The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) is not likely to take any action against its member who had threatened a head of department during the senate meeting of the Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) here on Tuesday. ABVP office-bearers claimed that they have not received any complaint. However, a senator demanded action against the senator, who owes allegiance to ABVP, for issuing a threat to a professor during the meeting. Kanu Algotar, who has been elected as senate member from the Arts faculty, intervened when head of department of rural studies Vipul Somani was speaking on the university’s annual report. Algotar demanded name of the college where irregularities had taken place, but was told by Somani that he would reply to the chairman as per the rules. This angered the senator, who threatened him. VNSGU vice-chancellor Shivendra Gupta was chairing the senate meeting. “A senator should not enter into an argument with any member. Issuing threat to a professor and HOD is a shameful incident. It is shameful for the vice-chancellor since a professor was threatened in his presence and no action has been taken as yet in the matter,” an elected senate member from the law faculty Bhavesh Rabari said. Rabari demanded strict action against the member. “An environment is being created in the university by issuing such threats so that people dare not raise any issue,” Rabari added. “We did not receive any complaint about the incident and so no action has been taken against the senate member. We have come to know about the incident but in the absence of any complaint, no action can been taken,” ABVP city coordinator Bhushan Vankhede said.  VNSGU authorities claimed the concerned parties have reached a compromise. “Both the individuals talked to each other after the senate meeting and it seems they reached a compromise between them,” vice-chancellor Gupta said.
