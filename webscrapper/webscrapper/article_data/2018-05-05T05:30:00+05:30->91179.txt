Mysuru: A biker fell from his vehicle, and sustained injuries, when   police who were carrying out random checks on automobiles on Hunsur Road, put a   in his way to stop him. The mishap occurred near the Karnataka State Open University on Friday.

 The cops, who were attempting to stop the biker, placed a barricade in front of Akshay Kumar rather abruptly, as a result of which he lost his balance and fell. A student, Akshay was none too pleased with the event, and along with other passersby on the road, sat in the middle of the road in a gesture of protest, bringing traffic movement on the thoroughfare to a juddering halt.
 
 The protesters demanded that city police commissioner A Subramanyeshwar Rao arrive on the spot. Criticising the cops for jeopardising lives of motorists while carrying out checks on vehicles, they said, “They are least bothered about the lives of people. All they care about is collecting fines and making money.”
 
 On hearing about the incident, sub-inspector Mamatha rushed to the spot to pacify the protesters. However, when a few people spotted her allegedly recording the incident on her phone, they were annoyed further and demanded an explanation from her.
 
 Meanwhile, the cops who placed the barricade in front of Akshay moved away when the crowd started to swell.
