Thane: Builders in Thane have protested against the   revenue department’s decision action of sealing offices of some developers, who allegedly defaulted on paying government dues like non-agricultural (NA) tax and royalty for excavating sand as per the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966. 

 Developer Suresh Haware, whose firm was penalized, said the action is “unjustified”. “We will challenge the move in court as a previous Supreme Court order says that if soil is excavated for construction purposes from any site and is used at the same spot, it does not attract any royalty. The soil excavated from our site as per the department’s claim was never taken out of the premises and so it is unfair to consider us as defaulters,” said Haware.
 
 Meanwhile, the district   is in the process of intensifying its action against defaulters and has plans to slap notices on another 250 prominent developers and commercial complexes from Thane and Navi Mumbai for defaulting payments of over Rs 100 crore to the treasury.
 
 “A list of 250 commercial unit holders has been compiled and we are sending notices to them,” said a senior revenue officer from the Thane collectorate.
