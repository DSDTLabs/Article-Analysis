CHANDIGARH: Candidates who appeared for the   ( ) preliminary examination in Chandigarh on Sunday found it to be moderately difficult.

 “Once again, UPSC has provided testimony to the fact that it should be unofficially called the ‘Unpredictable Public Service Commission’. It was observed in the last few years that first-timers were able to crack the examination, while old aspirants were somehow feeling betrayed due to little focus on the static portion of the syllabus. This year, UPSC has managed to maintain a fine balance between the dynamic and static portion of the syllabus,” said  , a Chandigarh-based UPSC trainer.
 
 Anmol Sharma, an IAS aspirant, said, “It was majorly focused on current affairs and the difficulty level was average. For me, it was a good attempt.”
 
 “The difficulty level was almost the same as last year’s paper. The static questions did not fall from the sky, they were inextricably linked to the current events of importance — Governor’s role, international events such as war in  , technological background of basic technical utilities that we have incorporated in our lifestyle today,” said  , an IAS aspirant.
 
 The exam has two papers and the first paper was held from 9.30am to 11.30am. The second paper started at 2.30pm. The exam has three stages — preliminary, mains and interview.
 
 The examination was a fine amalgamation of several events which provided dynamism to the statist syllabus to provide equal opportunities to all aspirants. We have advised and taught the students consistently to maintain a fine balance between the two aspects of the syllabus and develop the ability to link these two in a fine relationship,” added Malhotra.
