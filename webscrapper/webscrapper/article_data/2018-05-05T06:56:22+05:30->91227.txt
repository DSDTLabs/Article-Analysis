BENGALURU: The state government on Friday declared a holiday for government offices, banks, government and private schools and colleges on May 12, the day when citizens of Karnataka will head to polling booths.

 
 The move is to facilitate maximum participation of voters in the assembly elections. However, the holiday doesn’t apply to officials on poll duty and those deputed on emergency services.
 
 If any school or government office happens to house polling booths, the jurisdictional election officer can declare a holiday for them on Friday, May 11 as well, if it’s needed to make arrangements for polling.
 
 Schools or government offices where counting will be held on May 15 will also be shut for other operations.
 
 The notification states that permanent employees, contract staffers and dailywage labourers working in commercial establishments, industrial undertakings and other set-ups are eligible for a paid holiday on May 12.
