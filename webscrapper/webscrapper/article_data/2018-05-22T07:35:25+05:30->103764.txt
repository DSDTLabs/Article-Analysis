 KOCHI: Officials with the   in   said   in the city has come down during the period of April to May 2018, compared with January to March 2018. The mosquito density in the city stood between 90-100 MHD (man hour density) during January -March. 

 "Since April, we have found out that the density has come down to 80 MHD. Vector density up to 80 MHD is normal but if it goes beyond that then it needs to be monitored," said S Vinod, senior biologist at district vector control unit.
 
 Density is calculated based on number of mosquitoes caught by 10 people in an hour using an aspirator.
 
 "We have carried out high - intensive mosquito elimination programmes in every nook and corner of the city. We have also conducted source reduction and dengue surveillance activities in these areas," said Vinod.
 
 The official also said they are conducting mosquito eradication programmes in migrant workers camps as most of these disease outbreaks happen in such camps.
 
 The health department and vector control unit officials have asked the public to remain vigilant in the wake of summer showers as it can lead to waterlogging, which in turn can serve as an ideal ground for mosquito breeding.
 
 "There is a high chance for an increase in the density of Aedes Aegypti (dengue mosquitoes) during this time. If not monitored it can result in an outbreak, said Vinod.
 
 Meanwhile officials with health department, Kochi corporation, said that with support of various residents associations in the city they will soon launch a drive to remove non- bio degradable waste from homes.
 
 Kochi corporation health standing committee chairperson V K Minimol said, "To prevent the outbreak of diseases such as dengue fever, elimination of mosquito breeding grounds is crucial. Last year during this time around 100 cases of dengue and two deaths were reported within the city. This year except 2 or 3 cases, no major disease outbreaks occurred."
