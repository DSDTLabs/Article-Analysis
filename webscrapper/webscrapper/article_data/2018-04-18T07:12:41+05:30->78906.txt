State governments are with the Centre on seeking recall of the recent SC order allegedly diluting provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, home ministry officials said on Tuesday.

  “The Centre has made abundantly clear that there should be no dilution of the SC/ST Act. It has filed a review petition in the Supreme Court for recall of the order dated March 20, 2018. Insofar as the states are concerned, they are also on board. They are in touch with the Centre and many of them are taking steps. Some have already announced that they will associate with the Centre,” a ministry official said.
