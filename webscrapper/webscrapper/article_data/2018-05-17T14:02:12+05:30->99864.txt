MADURAI: A 75-year-old woman from Palani was killed as her house collapsed after rain lashed the town and its surroundings on Wednesday.

 The victim was identified as Saibin Biwi. Police sources said though the downpour was not heavy, neglect of the unstable tiled roof house resulted in the mishap.
 
 The incident took place on Wednesday evening, when the woman was alone in her house. On being alerted, a police team rushed to the spot and shifted the body to the Palani Government Hospital, where a postmortem will be conducted on Thursday. 
 
 Based on a complaint, a case was registered with the Palani taluk police station and investigation is underway. 
 
 Moderate to heavy rain also lashed the Kodaikanal and   in   and Virudhunagar districts. Due to rain, water level in the streams in   hills increased, the forest department assessed the situation and prohibited pilgrims from entering the Mahalingam temple located atop the hill. 
 
 The forest department had given four day permission for the devotees on the occasion of new moon day on Tuesday. As the terrain is dangerous due to the presence of many steams, the department promptly banned the devotees.
 
 Meanwhile, the water level in Kumbakarai falls located on the foothills of Kodaikanal hills too increased, resulting in the department banning visitors to take bath.
