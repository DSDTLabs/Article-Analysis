LUCKNOW: The rebellion by Dalit   MPs continues in Uttar Pradesh.

 Days after  , a tribal MP from   constituency, wrote a letter to PM   accusing the UP government of discrimination, the party’s Dalit MP from Etawah, Ashok Kumar Dohre, sought Modi’s intervention in cases of atrocities after the April 2 Dalit agitation.
 
 
 In his letter, Dohre said Dalits, especially in UP, were being targeted by police and cases were being lodged against them after April 2. He said Dalits were being pulled out of their homes and beaten up. “Casteist comments were being hurled at them,” Dohre said, demanding action against police.
 
 On March 16, Kharwar wrote a letter to the PM saying his brother was removed as Block Pramukh by local BJP leaders with the help of block members affiliated to BSP.
 
 He claimed instances of corruption in the district administration and forest department in Chandauli, which is close to his constituency.
 
 “After BJP came to power, I hoped things would improve but nothing happened,” said Kharwar, claiming that his home was deliberately included in forest zone in 2015 and his brother was subjected to casteist remarks.
 
 He claimed that he had met CM Adityanath Yogi twice only to be “scolded and asked to leave”. In his letter, Kharwar also claimed of his meeting UP BJP president Mahendra Nath Pandey, who is also Chandauli MP, and BJP organisational secretary Sunil Bansal but to no avail.
 
 “I also received life threat after which I had to approach the SC/ST commission,” he wrote.
 I went and met all top BJP leaders. After exhausting all my options within the party, I have gone to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes,” he wrote.
 
 Five days ago, BJP’s dalit MP from Bahraich Savitri Bai Phule had held an agitation in Lucknow claiming that the constitutional provision of reservation for Dalits were under threat. BJP MP from Delhi Udit Raj has also gone public over souring relations with top party leaders.
