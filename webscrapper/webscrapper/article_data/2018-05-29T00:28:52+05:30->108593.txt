NEW DELHI:   on Monday sought the response of Delhi Metro   Corporation in a PIL seeking in-depth inquiry into the   of rails procured through a Swiss company for  .

 The petition, which came up for hearing before a bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice C Hari Shankar, alleged that the rails supplied by the Swiss company — East Metal AG — may have high content of Hydrogen making them more susceptible to breaks or fractures, which could lead to a major disaster.
 
 The court sought an extensive study of its effects before going ahead with the pending projects.
 
 Rails are continuous line of steel bars laid on the ground as one of a pair forming a railway track and the PIL claimed that DMRC had procured these for its future and current expansion plans.
 
 While seeking a response from DMRC and the Swiss company, the court asked it to furnish its stand by October 9, the next date of hearing. DMRC had won the contract for supplying the rails.
 
 The plea also urged that the rails should not be used till their procurement and safety is inquired into, as lives of millions of commuters would be at stake. The bench, however, refused to go into that aspect and posted the case for October.
