Panaji: With heavy machinery deployed to level the massive heaps of mud and debris dumped earlier in a long, lowlying strip of roadside land on Miramar-Dona Paula concrete road, the reclamation process appears to have entered the second phase. The clandestine mud-filling in a lowlying barren agricultural land within coastal regulation zone (CRZ) of Caranzalem beach had started on weekends in mid-December last year. The spot below a huge sand dune area with a board indicating that it was a property gifted by reverend canon Francisco da Cunha Souto Maior, a philanthropist in the 18th century was the first to be dumped with massive quantities of mud. Corporation of city of Panaji (CCP), including then mayor, Surendra Furtado kept denying any knowledge about the illegal dumping. The blatant dumping in the lowlying area continued over the months while authorities looked the other way. A couple of months later, another strip of land, further ahead towards Dona Paula near a beachside hotel, was also being reclaimed. On Saturday, heavy machinery was seen at the site in front of a showroom, as the mud dumped sporadically has been levelled. “A platform has been made at a level higher than the road. With the drainage blocked, this may affect the flow of water and cause flooding in the area,” a villager said. Citizens are irked by the apathy shown by authorities in initiating action against the illegal reclamation in CRZ area. The media had reported the issue several times, but CCP kept on insisting that no complaint had been received. Nandkumar Kamat, an environmentalist, said that he had telephonically informed the CCP. Newly-sworn in CCP mayor, Vithal Chopdekar said that he was not aware about the land-filling, but assured to look into the matter, especially the weekend levelling activity. “I will talk to the commissioner, who is out-of-station and look into it,” he said.
