NAVI MUMBAI: While the budget presented by the previous   municipal commissioner Tukaram Munde focused on tapping all resources for earning revenue, the current civic chief, Ramaswami N is expected to include various developmental works.

 The civic body will be presenting its budget for the financial year 2018—19 in a fortnight before the standing committee.
 
 Two projects that are likely to be incorporated in the budget expenditure are the barrier -free   as well as a comprehensive contract system for maintenance and repair work of all civic assets. “To make Navi Mumbai pedestrian friendly it was long envisioned that the city footpaths should be free of all forms of barriers. The project will be an important component in the next year’s expenditure. Around Rs 25 crore may be provisioned for the project,” said a senior civic official.
 
 Mayor Jaywant Sutar is being commended for clearing the decks for the project. “Due credit has to be given to the newly appointed mayor who, in his first general body meeting in January, cleared all proposals which were pending for five months. One of them was the barrier free walkalbility across the city. So by the time the budget will be finalised the work order of the project will be through,” added the official
 
 An annual contract system for maintenance of civic assets such as gardens, playgrounds or civic owned buildings is also being planned. 
 
 Ramaswami is still finalising the budget and factor in developmental works in it.
