LUCKNOW: Soon, users would be able to rate public toilets across the city on the basis of their experience. The new system would enable to log their experience on the spot with just the press of a button installed on the site. 

 Based on the feedback,   will take corrective measures. In the first phase, LMC will install the machines in 50 public toilets. This includes areas around Hazratganj, Lalbagh and   railway station. The decision comes about two weeks ahead of   (cleanliness) survey scheduled to begin in Lucknow in early February.
 
 The move is aimed at supervising private contractors running these toilets. The machine, which bears three coloured buttons, 'Green' for clean, 'Yellow' for OK and 'Red' for dirty, will be installed at the entrance of toilets. Since these machines are GPS- (Global Positioning System) enabled, the feedback will reach the central server of Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) giving location details and users' rating instantly to the union ministry and LMC officials. 
 
 Additional municipal commissioner   said, "This is an ambitious scheme of SBM. We have roped in a public telecom operator to provide these machines for public/community toilets in the city. This will help us keep a tab on operation and maintenance of toilets." 
 
 Currently, Lucknow has about 250 public toilets and aims to increase the number to 350 by the end of this year as per the target set under SBM. It aims to install these machines at all these sites gradually.
