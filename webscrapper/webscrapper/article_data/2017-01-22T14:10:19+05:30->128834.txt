KAKINADA: The Kapu Satyagraha Yatra by Mudragada Padmanabham scheduled to be held from January 25 has been denied permission as no request for approval has been submitted, said East Godavari police superintendent M Ravi Prakash. The rally was planned from Ravulapalem to Antarvedi in West Godavari via Amalapuram.

 Addressing the media here on Saturday, Ravi Prakash said as per   guidelines, police permission is a must for padayatras. He said the   had applied for permission to organise a bike rally, but it was rejected. “If Mudragada seeks permission for his rally, the police department will assess the situation and take a decision,” Ravi Prakash added. 
 
 Meanwhile, Kapu Sangham state coordinator Vasireddy Yesudas said they would organise the padayatra at any cost with or without police permission. “Did   take permission for Mee Kosam Padayatra in the state? When a political party which has to honour the constitution did not take permission, why should a small caste association ask the police,” he questioned.
