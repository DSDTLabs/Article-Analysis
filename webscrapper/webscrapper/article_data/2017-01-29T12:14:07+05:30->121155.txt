 may have extended an olive branch to the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) party to ensure the smooth release of his film 'Raees', but his troubles are far from over. According to latest reports, it is rival party   that is now fishing for trouble. 

 
 
 Akshaye Rathi, a leading distributor, took to Twitter to announce that he has received threat letters from the political party's Chhattisgarh wing. In the letter, the party leader has warned distributors of dire consequences, if they go ahead with the film's release on January 25.
 
  
  
 The distributor has shared the letter and has been pleading with Shah Rukh Khan fans to help him bring this issue to light. Rathi also pleaded with the Chhattisgarh Chief Minister's Office to look into the situation and ensure that law and order prevail. Further, he asked the Shiv Sena's Youth Wing President Aaditya Thackeray if he endorsed such behaviour. 
 
  
  
  
  
 After the controversy surrounding the release of Karan Johar's 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil', all eyes turned to the SRK action-flick for having Pakistani star Mahira Khan as the leading lady in the film. This won't be the first time that the actor has been at the receiving end of the party's politics. A few years ago, Shah Rukh had to brave the Sena storm during the release of his film 'My Name Is Khan'. 
 
 Shah Rukh Khan and the Shiv Sena are yet to comment on the same.
