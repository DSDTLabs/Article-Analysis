 Reacting to the news, the chief minister told reporters in New Delhi that the police had zeroed in on the suspects and nobody would escape from the police net. 
 
 “The police have identified the suspects. A comprehensive inquiry is on. Attack against a woman is a matter of serious concern. 
 
 “It shouldn’t have happened. But there is no truth in opposition's claims that the law and order situation has collapsed,” he said.
 
 “ The law and order situation is perfect.Nobody needs to be worried over it,” the chief minister added.
 
 Meanwhile, KPCC president   and BJP state president Kummanam Rajasekharan have come down heavily on Vijayan. 
 
 While Kummanam wanted Vijayan to relinquish the home portfolio, Sudheeran said the state was under the grip of goonda-quotation mafia.
 
 “It’s not democracy that we witness in Kerala these days. It’s nothing but goondaraj that we see around. The kidnapping of an actress and the murder of BJP worker at Kadakkavur are the latest episodes that indicated lawlessness in the state,” Rajasekharan said.
 
 Sudheeran said the attack against the film actor was shocking. “The incident is a dishonour to the whole of Kerala.” he said.
