JABALPUR: A Sikh charged under the Arms Act for allegedly keeping a sword in place of a ‘kripan’ has written to the DGP, claiming that CM   is liable for a similar case since he was gifted a sword during a religious ceremony held in Bhopal on January 5. 

 Ajit Singh alias   of Jabalpur has written to the DGP that in Madhya Pradesh, only Sikhs are allowed to keep weapons between 6 inches and 9 inches long. The law says that any blade longer than 9 inches will be considered a weapon even if a Sikh carries it. But Sikh religious leaders have gifted the CM a sword that is longer than 9 inches. In his January 17 complaint, he has submitted a copy of the twitter handle of the chief minister where he is seen accepting the sword. 
 
 He has also attached the copy of an MP high court order. Ajit Singh is charged with carrying a sword. He filed a revision petition in district court, which gave him relief, but the revision order was dismissed by the high court. He has attached the same HC order with his complaint.
