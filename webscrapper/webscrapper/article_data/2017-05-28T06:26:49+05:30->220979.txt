AHMEDABAD: Election fever seems to have gripped the   of Commerce and Industries (GCCI) with 64 nominations filed for 33 posts by the   closed on Saturday. The last date for filing nominations was May 27. With the nominations over, now full-scale campaigning for the posts are expected to begin.

 In the run-up to the elections, candidates who are fighting for top posts like senior   and president have formed a separate panel, known as ‘Active Panel’, to campaign jointly.
 
 According to the GCCI constitution, usually, the senior vice-president is promoted to the post of president and therefore, Shailesh Patwari, who is currently the senior vice-president will be promoted, replacing Bipin Patel as president. Also, according to convention, the existing vice-president is promoted to the post of senior vice-president.
 
 However, this time, vice president K T Patel will have to battle it out with Jaymin Vasa, who is currently the chairman of the foreign trade committee at GCCI.
 
 Sources said that Patel has joined hands with president of Gujarat Traders Federation, Jayendra Tanna. Bhargav Thakkar, Hemant Shah and Tanna are in the fray for the post of vice-president.
 
 On another side,   is forming a different panel. “We have filed around 17 nominations for several posts, and will declare our panel soon,” said Gadhvi.
 
 “In the wake of demonetization, businesses have suffered major losses and needed policy decisions were not taken,” Gadhvi said, adding, “At such a time, GCCI representatives were not effective in addressing industry and trade issues.”
 
 “Now, it is up to the chamber members to decide, whether they want to become event managers of the government or resolve their issues,” said Gadhvi.
