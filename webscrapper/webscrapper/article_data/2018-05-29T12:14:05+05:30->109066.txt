The Bengali version of ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati ’ is all set to hit the small screen from August 16. Bengali superstar   is going to host the show, stepping into the shoes of Bollywood megastar   from the Hindi version. But the actor says there is no pressure on him.

  “There is no comparison between us (him and Amitabh Bachchan). I respect him a lot and have watched KBC right from its launch. But I can tell you, I will be hosting the show not as 'actor Prosenjit Chatterjee' but as   da," he said at a press conference on Monday (May 28). 
 
 Prosenjit promised that the viewers will get to see him in a brand new ‘avatar’, which is closer to their hearts. 
 
 “I will talk to the people sitting on the hot seat just like I treat my guests. There will be warmth. And I will be happy if anyone wins Rs. 1 crore. That way for the first time I will also be able to see such a huge amount of money,” says the actor while bursting into laughter. 
 
 Interestingly, a few years ago, former Indian skipper  , was seen hosting the Bengali version of ‘Kaun Banega Corepati’ on another entertainment channel. But Prosenjit isn’t ready to draw any comparison with him either. “Sourav is my dearest friend and I think he will be happy to see me hosting the show too,” says the humble actor.
 
 Rahul Chakravarty, Business head of the channel informed that the entry process has already begun. A special team is working for research and preparing questions for the show.
