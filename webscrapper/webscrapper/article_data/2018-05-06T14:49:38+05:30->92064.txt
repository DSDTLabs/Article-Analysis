 Truth  , a private forensic lab in the city, says it receives at least 20-30 cases every year from companies. The test, however, is done only with the consent of the subject.
 
 
 "Polygraph tests are only an investigating tool which has corroborative evidence value.

In some European countries, polygraph is a key part of the recruitment process," Truth Labs director   told STOI. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 "We have lie detector equipment and experts who come from different parts of the country. Sweating, heart rate, pulse and blood pressure are measured while three types of questions are asked. Controlled, Relevant and Irrelevant questions are posed to the person, for which he/she has to give yes or no answers. While they answer, the graph is measured," Prasad added.
 
 The lab, for now, is sticking to only employee matters and is not entertaining requests for tests to check family matters such as extramarital affairs unless there is a court order. Each polygraph test costs around 5,000 to 10,000 depending on the case. The service is also offered by another company,  , in the city. 
 
 "People who want to prove their innocence in civil matters also approach us with the help of the party that makes an accusation," Prasad said.
 
 Till recently, Truth Labs was outsourcing DNA fingerprinting tests to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology. "Now we have tied up with a Delhi-based private lab for DNA fingerprinting. Paternity tests are done only with consent of both wife and husband," he added.
