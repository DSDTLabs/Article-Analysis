ZIRAKPUR: Still those bumpy roads, that improper garbage-collection system, lack of sewerage and drainage, nonfunctional streetlights, and ill-maintained parks, even after a year of the TOI roundtable event in which   legislator   and municipal council president   had promised early solutions to these problems of  .

 
 During that TOI in Conversation event in Zirakpur, residents had complained about potholed roads, dark streets, swamping, encroachment by real-estate developers, and unscientific waste management. The MC President had claimed that the civic authorities were in the process of resolving these issues. During a revisit to Zirakpur after a year, TOI found a few roads in worse condition than the previous June. It seemed those surfaces had not been repaired for more than a year, even after several reminders to the municipal council. Residents anticipate the roads to turn worst during monsoon, when water covers the potholes and makes driving treacherous.
 
 Zirakpur resident   said that for the past one year, the residents had been asking for repair of the internal roads.
 
 There are unkempt green areas in Zirakpur but no proper park around the housing societies. Many people in Zirakpur don’t have a place to go for morning and evening walks. The civic authorities don’t have even any plan to developed any green patch in Zirakpur.
 
 The sewerage and drainage systems are absent from many parts of Zirakpur. P K Sharma, chairman of the confederation of resident welfare associations of Zirakpur north, said: “We have no relief from the problem of water accumulation after rain. Traffic chaos because of absence of service lanes is another issue. “Because there aren’t many cops around, anti-social elements have free run of the area,” Zirakpur resident   said.
