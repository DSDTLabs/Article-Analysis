JAIPUR: All India   Sabha (AIKS), the farmersâ€™ wing of the CPI (M), has given a call for a march to Jaipur on February 22 to lay an indefinite siege of the state Assembly in fulfilment of various demands, including waiver of loan. 

 At a meeting of the state committee of the organization held under former   and national president Amra Ram took this decision on Wednesday. The budget session of the   assembly is beginning on February 5. 
 
 Member of the state committee   said, the decision was taken in the light of the fact that state government is backtracking on its promise to waive off farmers loan up to Rs 50,000 reached with Kisan Sabha on September 13 last year.
 
 He said, farmers from all over the state will join the siege on February 22. In order to create awareness among the farmers, Kisan parliament would be organized at the village level. The main demands of the farmers include agriculture loan waive off, implementation of   committee report, flat rate for agriculture power connections, and Rs 2000 pension per month to farmers over 60 years of age on   model. 
 
 Yadav alleged that the ruling   is not paying attention to the plight of the farmers in the state. The farmers are not getting remunerative price to their produce and the state government is refusing to honour its promise given to the farmers, it alleged.
