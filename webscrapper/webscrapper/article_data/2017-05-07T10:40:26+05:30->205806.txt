NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked   (AAP) to furnish details of its overseas   to rule out any violations of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act. Even though the home ministry on Friday clarified that the communication to AAP was a "routine query put to all political parties from time to time", AAP was quick to allege a witch hunt by the   government. 

 In its communication, the home ministry directed the Arvind Kejriwal-led party to explain certain funding from abroad, based on suspicion that the party may have violated FCRA provisions. 
 
 The ministry clarified that the communication was part of its "routine" queries sent to a few other political parties as well on overseas funding.
