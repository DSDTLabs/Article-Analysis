CHARMINAR: Two edifices stand shoulder to shoulder just south of the Musi. Two institutions and landmarks of the  , both inalienable components of the city's heritage. While one is the pillar of democracy the judiciary the other is an important institution of learning: the Government  . But it appears that ruling dispensations, including the recent one, are not very keen on preserving the structure. 

 The college, which is an example of the Indo-Saracenic architecture, finds itself in a complete state of disrepair. Lime mortar plaster has given way to naked brick and stone masonry. There is a break in the crenellations and several such structures are damaged. This is the state of affairs of the building.
 
 Once listed as a grade II - B building by the then   (HCC), it was proposed to be handed over to the Department of Archaeology and Museums (DAM) in 2011. Minutes of meeting of the HCC, then a concern of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA), show that the body proposed the change in custody. "The committee noted that a letter was addressed to the principal secretary to the government,   (CE-I-2) Department, J- Block, Secretariat, as per the suggestions of the committee. The committee did not object to the transferring of the heritage property to the   (sic)," an excerpt from minutes of the meeting of HCC reads.
 
 "This was done to allow better monitoring of the heritage structure. It also meant better allocation of funds for conservation of the structure," said a former HCC member who did not wish to be identified.
