GANDHINAGAR: The   Congress is planning a massive campaign to revive its organisational presence in the state’s municipal corporations and municipalities. 

 On Wednesday, the Gujarat Congress’s new president, Amit  , and its new in-charge, Rajeev Satav, along with other senior leaders, had a day-long meeting with party members from municipal corporation and municipality areas, to plan a strategy for reviving the party’s prospects in urban areas, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
 
 Chavda said, “The party has decided to appoint zone vice presidents in municipal corporations and other office bearers. The party will focus on raising issues of urban people aggressively and will expose corruption in BJP-led urban local bodies. The party will approach NGOs and opinion makers in urban areas. Like in rural areas, the party will appoint one male and one female party worker for every ward. We will aggressively raise issues of water supply, public infrastructure, road, traffic, education and employment.’’ 
 
 Meanwhile,  , leader of the opposition in the state assembly and senior   leader, said, “The Gujarat BJP government has failed to convince the Madhya Pradesh BJP government to provide the required Narmada water to Gujarat. It is unfortunate the MP CM has denied Narmada water to Gujarat. Chief minister Vijay Rupani must sit on a fast against MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and demand water for Gujarat.
