AHMEDABAD: The city’s   has procured fiveC  , the first for any fire services in Gujarat. The cameras were used for the first time   at   on Friday morning.

 Rajesh Bhatt, the additional chief fire officer, Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES), said that the cameras have been given to deputy chief fire officer ranks and above. “The camera has range of 30 metres and is water-resistant with nearly-unbreakable body,” he said. “The cameras would be handy in pinpointing the location of fire’s starting point and major affected areas, and in searching for people when visibility is low.” The camera prepares a heat map, detecting the temperature of objects and differentiates between various affected regions, something which is not possible with naked eyes. It can also ‘see’ inside walls, spotting such objects as overheated electric wiring. AFES officials said that the cameras would help speed up firefighting operations and increase effectiveness of rescue. Sources said that several fire services in Indian cities including Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, and Bengaluru have thermal-imaging cameras but only a few have mobile-based technology.
