DHARAMAPURI: A gang tampered with a signal board and forced the New Delhi-bound   to stop before   in   just after midnight on Sunday before escaping with   worth around 3.5 lakh from five women. 

  Four trains were delayed by at least 15 minutes due to the damaged signals, a Salem railway division official said. Normalcy was restored after around 45 minutes. 
 
 A railway official said the Thiruvananthapuram-Delhi Kerala Express train left the Kerala capital in the afternoon and reached Salem around 10pm. It crossed Morappur around 11pm and was heading to Jolarpet. Around 12.05am, when it was less than a kilometer from Thottampatti railway station, the pilot did not get the signal and was forced to bring the train to a halt. 
 
 As the crew waited, a gang of men suddenly barged into S1, S2 and S3 coaches and snatched gold chains from five women passengers. "They targeted those sleeping on the lower berths near the door," a government railway police officer said. The women raised an alarm, but before the Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel in the coaches could arrive, the robbers jumped out. "They disappeared into the darkness," the officer added.
