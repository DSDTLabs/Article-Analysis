GURUGRAM: The   (HSPCB) has asked the   to remove construction debris dumped illegally on roads in  , creating air pollution in the locality.

 Acting on complaints lodged by residents, HSPCB has written to civic guardians, asking them to take prompt action against contractors violating the rules. “Residents are worried about the rising air pollution in their area. The corporation should clear the debris and send it to the designated sites,” said an official of HSPCB, requesting anonymity.
 
 According to residents, the road was marked by beautiful green belts till some seven years ago. Since then, construction waste has robbed the area of its green sheen. “One can see all sorts of construction material — sand, cement, bricks and fine concrete — and heaps of debris dumped along the road,” said Rohit Singh, a resident.
 
 “I have to keep windows of my apartment closed all day to prevent dust particles from entering the house. My 5-year-old son is already using a nebulizer. I think I have made a big mistake by moving to   from Delhi,” said Sushmita Sahu, another resident.
 
 Green activists feel such activities also pose danger to soil and groundwater. 
 
 “Even though we don’t have any hard evidence against anyone, we know trucks carry debris from nearby construction sites on Golf Course Extension road at night and dump the waste here. Mounds of waste are also blocking the internal sector roads,” said Pradeep Oberoi, a resident of Uptown in Sector 66. “We approached HSPCB only after our repeated pleas to MCG fell on deaf ears,” he added.
