AHMEDABAD:   investigating a case of rape on 16-year-old student, arrested the 27-year-old tuition teacher from his native place near Chanasma in Patan district early on Sunday morning. Police also seized his mobile phone and sent him for medical examination.

  On Saturday, Shraddha Patel (name changed), a resident of Sabarmati, had lodged a complaint with Chandkheda police against  , a physics teacher running PB Patel Classes at Jantanagar, for rape and blackmail. 
 
 The class XII (science) student had alleged that Patel had spiked his water in May last year and had clicked her pictures in compromising position. Using it to blackmail her, Patel had allegedly raped her multiple times in Ahmedabad and elsewhere.
 
 V R Vaniya, inspector of Chandkheda police station, said that they got to know that Patel had gone to Chanasma in Patan. Working on the information, a team was sent to the village where Patel was found. 
 
 “He had fled from Ahmedabad after he got a whiff of the complaint. He has denied the charges levelled against him. He is unmarried and his parents used to visit him frequently at his Chandkheda residence. His family is involved in farming,” said Vaniya. 
 
 He added that as the victim has complained about clips and photographs by Patel in her complaint, his mobile phone has been sent for forensic analysis.
