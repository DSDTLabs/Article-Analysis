Thirty years after his mentor,  , thespian   received the highest French civilian award, the Legion of Honour, in a ceremony in Kolkata this week. It was a moment of pride for Bengal, but I could only see a few of the veteran actor’s associates at the event held at a   hotel. I am sure the actor must have wanted a low-key ceremony devoid of political colours, but from the look of it, the organisers goofed up while drawing up the guest list. Those who have worked closely with the actor were sad about missing out on the chance to witness the insignia of   d’Honneur conferred on him. When it comes to this man, everyone wants a piece of him.
