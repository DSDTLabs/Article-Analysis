CHENNAI: The 35 lakh increase in suburban train commuters over one year has also been due to stringent ticket checking and administrative measures taken by the Chennai division.

 Officials discovered that many commuters did not buy tickets. So teams with   (RPF) were formed to identify such people and persuade them to buy tickets, instead of imposing fine on the first-time offenders.
 
 These special squads were placed at the entrance of many stations, especially   and Egmore. Meanwhile, RPF closed all other exits to prevent ticket-less travellers escaping.
 
 On the administrative side, officials discovered that many ticket-collectors were in the same spot for 20 years, in violation of vigilance guidelines.
 
 Many of them were also found to be working only for few hours at their spots or employing proxies. Periodical transfers were effected and fresh legs were placed in important locations. This has also contributed to more ticket-less travellers being apprehended, officials said. The transfers were done against great resistance from employee unions, who have also gone to court against such orders.
