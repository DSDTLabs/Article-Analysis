If you listen to the songs of  , you wouldn’t be able to tell that they were composed four years ago. To make songs that will be relevant years later is exactly what   — who has composed and sung all the five songs of the film — had in mind. A lot has changed personally for the   rapper since; here’s a look at just how much: back when he was approached to compose music for the film, Chandan didn’t even own a laptop, and today, he has a world tour and another tour of the US lined up. In a candid chat with Bangalore Times, he tells us about his first-time experience as a Kannada film music composer.

 
 
 When I was approached for Seizer, Vinay Krishna (director) told me that it is a technical movie and it’s got a lot to do with cars. I’m also crazy about cars, and I like to experiment with my music, so I was excited. When they approached me in 2014, I didn’t even own a laptop to compose music; I only had a guitar, which I had bought for `5,000 with my first salary in 2010, despite others telling me not to (since I was a nobody back then). Vinay liked a song that I had composed with just my guitar. Seizer is my debut film as composer, and I wanted the songs to sound fresh even after five years. And that’s what’s happened. If you listen to the songs — a mix of rap numbers and two romantic, melodious songs — they sound like they’ve been composed recently.
 
 
 
 I believe in my strength and don’t dabble in things I don’t know much about. We have many talented, melodious singers here; rap has always been my strength and that’s what I have stuck to. I haven’t learnt music, but I know how to compose music. Back in 2014, rap wasn’t popular, but that was my forte, so that is what I stuck to. Having said that, I am happy that the two melodious number from Seizer —   and   — are doing well on music charts.
