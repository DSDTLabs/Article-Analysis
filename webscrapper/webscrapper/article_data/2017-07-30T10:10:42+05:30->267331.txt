HYDERABAD: After getting used to Tollywood personalities stepping out of swanky cars and rushing into   to depose before investigators for alleged links in the drugs case, prohibition and excise officials were in for a surprise on Saturday when a person came to their headquarters on a two-wheeler. He was identified as Srinivas, driver of actor  .

 Since July 19, when director   appeared, and till Friday, when Ravi Teja appeared before the   (SIT) sleuths, all Tollywood personalities arrived in style in popular cars. Srinivas, however, came on his bike and went straight to the fifth floor, where the SIT office is located. 
 
 He was called by SIT sleuths for questioning as they suspect that he was allegedly used by Ravi Teja in transporting the contraband delivered by the peddler to the actor. Srinivas was called based on the confession given by one of the peddlers.
 
 Srinivas denied the allegations. He denied having any knowledge about drugs. He was mainly questioned to corroborate what Ravi Teja had informed the sleuths during his questioning on Friday. 
 
 The officials, who started questioning Srinivas at 10.30am, let him off by 1.30pm. Apart from  , the SIT interrogated two more persons,   and Danish Rajadhan. On Monday, Tanish Alladi, who is one of the 12 Tollywood personalities, has been called for questioning.
