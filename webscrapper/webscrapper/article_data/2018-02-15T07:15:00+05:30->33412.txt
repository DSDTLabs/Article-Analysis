GURUGRAM:   and police officials have said that no inquiry has been sought into the accident that left three masons with burn injuries on Tuesday after high-tension power lines allegedly fell on them when they were working on the roof of a building in  . 

 The discom said the accident was caused by the 33kV power line going towards the Rozakha Meo feeder but ruled out any inquiry, saying that it was at a permissible height and did not fall on the masons. TOI called up police officials in Sohna who also said that no complaint had been filed with them.
 
 On Tuesday morning, three masons — Girish (42), Rahul (23), and Islam (30) — were working on the roof of a single-storey building in Shiv Colony when high-tension cables, which had been held up with pillars made of wooden sticks, fell on them after the pillar was knocked down. Discom officials, however, argued that the cables were at a permissible height, adding that only one mason suffered burn injuries after his hand tool touched the 33kV line. “The cables did not fall on them. In that case, the electricity connection would have been cut off, but that didn’t happen. Our senior officials went to the spot and ascertained that one person suffered electrocution after his hand tool touched the 33kV line,” said Ashutosh Kumar, executive engineer, Sohna, DHBVN. Officials added that the men were involved in illegal construction work as discom guidelines prohibit such work within a radius of 1.5 metres of the 33kV power lines. KC Aggarwal, superintendent engineer, Gurgaon, circle II, said, “This is not a case of negligence on the part of the discom.”
 
 According to officials, they have not received any complaint but ascertained facts as they have to file a report to senior officials in two days. “We were anyway going to replace those lines but that was deferred because of proposed road widening and railway line construction work,” an official said.
