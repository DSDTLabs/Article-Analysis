CHENNAI: Election fever has gripped Tamil film industry again. After the actor union elections last year, the   election is nearing. 

 Actor Vishal, general secretary of the South Indian Artistes' Association (Nadigar Sangam), will fight a team of veterans headed by R Radhakrishnan, producer of films like 'Oru Poo Oru Thuppakki' and 'Galatta Ganapathi'. Vishal's star-studded team includes actors and directors who have also produced multiple films. This includes Prakash Raj, Gautam Menon and Myskin . The team headed by Radhakrishnan includes K Rajan, Sivasakthi Pandian and J S K  .
 
 The election will be fought on long-pending issues including piracy. Both teams have vowed to fight online piracy and restrain local cable operators who screen newly-released films. Several hundred films produced over the last decade are yet to come out of the cans. The contestants have promised to ensure these films are sold to satellite channels. 
 
 Vishal who met the press on Sunday said, "We have fulfilled all our election promises made during the Nadigar Sangam polls. Those who headed the producer council over the last 10 years have done nothing for the welfare of the producers."
 
 Radhakrishnan and team announced that they will hold an agitation on Monday morning in front of the Nadigar Sangam headquarters in T Nagar to voice outrage against Vishal, who they say denigrated the producer fraternity during a campaign speech.
