Vadodara: When you walk in the special operations group (SOG) police station, you will come across a big wooden frame that carries photographs of the cops posted there. The photographs kept right at the entry of the police station have names and designations of the policemen who have done commendable work in last one month. 

 “Many policemen do good work and hence they need to be encouraged. So I suggested the initiative that can go a long way in improving the efficiency of the cops. I also give prizes to the cops who perform well,” said city police commissioner, Manoj Sashidhar. Sashidhar has revived the SOG that had been inactive earlier and is encouraging them to take up important cases. 
 
 SOG police inspector, H M Vyas said that it is important for a cop to be appreciated for his work. “If the cop is motivated, their self-confidence will go up and they will work better. The idea behind keeping the photographs is to give them a sense of achievement and also create an environment where he or she works harder to ensure that their photographs stay on the frame for months,” Vyas told TOI. 
 
 The SOG cops, whose photos have been kept in the frame, have solved the cases of burglary, busted liquor trade and seized weapons. “Also the policemen who bring information that leads to cracking of the case or busting of liquor raids also get place in the frame. And it has worked as our team now works harder,” Vyas said.
