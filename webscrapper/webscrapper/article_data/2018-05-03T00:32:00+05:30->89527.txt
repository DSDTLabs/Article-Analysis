Guntur: Deputy chief minister K E Krishnamurthy on Wednesday sent ripples in political circles after he squarely put the blame for the cash crunch on the Union government. He alleged that the Narendra Modi government is diverting money from the banks only to the election-bound states to fund its candidates. He said shortage of currency notes in ATMs across India, including Andhra Pradesh, is the result of unethical practices being followed by the Modi government.

 Krishnamurthy participated in several programmes in Sattenapalle constituency, organised as part of the birthday celebrations of state assembly speaker Kodela Siva Prasada Rao on Wednesday. He also inaugurated the newly-constructed sub-registrar office.
 
 Speaking at the occasion Krishnamurthy said that the NDA-led government is working only for the BJP-ruled states. He declared that such a tendency threatened the democracy in the country. He showered praises on Rao for his developmental exercises in Narasaraopet and Sattenapalle constituencies. 
 
 The speaker said Telugu people taught a fitting lesson to the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for insulting the state and the people are ready to do the same to the present Union government. He criticised the Centre for not coming forward to support the state in anhour of crisis. “It was unfortunate that they are going with corrupt people and convicts,” Rao alleged.
