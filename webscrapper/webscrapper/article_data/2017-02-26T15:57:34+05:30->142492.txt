Ever since the trailer release of debut director  's  , there has been a buzz in the Kannada film industry. The film, which is an out-an-out family entertainer, stars   and   and has been produced by K Manju. Gurunandan, who was last seen in the hit film First Rank Raju, is excited about the film, and for more reasons than one. Here's what he had to say about what makes this film an 'eye-opening' entertainer:

 
 
 Smile Please revolves around a joint family that is headed by a strict matriarch. When my character visits their house, how he takes it upon himself to go around spreading smiles and cheer around forms the rest of the story. When Raghu narrated the script to me, I immediately took it up because of two reasons. First, it's a family entertainer and exactly the kind of light-hearted movie that I'm looking to be associated with, and second, because of how relevant the subject is. In our busy lives today, we have forgotten how to connect with our families and live with a smile on our faces.
 
 
 
 Although the film has only four songs composed by  , each one of them is quite different. There are components of melody, romance, familial bonding and more in each. The entire album is a well-composed one, filled with hum-worthy numbers.
 
 
 
 Most of the film's shooting took place in   and Bengaluru, and the joint-family scenes take place in a palatial house. The way the film has been shot is bound to remind you of our ancestral homes in villages, where we would've spent many holidays.
 
 
 
 Kavya Shetty was one of the best co-stars I've worked with so far. She's very helpful and cooperative on the sets. The rapport we shared can be seen
