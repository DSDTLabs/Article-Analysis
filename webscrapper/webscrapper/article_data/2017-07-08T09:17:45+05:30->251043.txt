AHMEDABAD: The body of 23-year-old Sahil Dabhi, a resident of   in Nikol, was found in the   at the riverfront near NID on Friday morning. While the youth, a second-year college student, had gone   on June 21, his family said he had called his mother several times, telling her there was a threat to his life and to his family.

 Police sources said that a few days ago Dabhi had couriered a letter to his parents, telling them that there was a threat to his life and he couldn’t return home. “While the family says Dabhi may have been kidnapped and killed, we have registered a case of accidental death and are investigating the case,” said a senior police official.
 
 According to police records, Dabhi left his house saying he was going to Vadodara for a job interview and never returned. The family had lodged a missing person’s complaint at Nikol police station.
 
 His family claimed that a few days later, he had called them, expressing a fear that if he returned home his life could be in danger. “After that, his phone was switched off,” said a relative of his.
 
 The mystery deepened when the family received a letter from Dabhi, sent by courier, from Bopal. “He again mentioned the threat to his life in the letter,” said a family member. Police sources said they checked   footage at the courier service office and found that Dabhi was alone when he posted the letter.
 
 According to police sources, about two days ago, Dabhi had phoned his mother and said that ‘they’ would kill him. “When his mother asked him where he was, he said somewhere near the riverfront,” a relative said. Dabhi’s bag, which he had when he left home on June 21, was found on the riverfront near NID on July 6, one day before his body was found in the river. “We have sent the body for postmortem, to know the cause of death,” said a senior police officer.
