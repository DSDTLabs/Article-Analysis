It’s ironic. On Thursday, even as the   was busy setting up a life-size installation of the state animal, the spotted deer at the   as part of the ongoing beautification drive, a nearly one-year-old male deer was found dead at the  . Marking what could perhaps be first instance of deer death in year 2018 at UoH, the deer’s carcass with its antlers intact, was spotted near the  , which has a dense forest cover. 

 Blaming the unchecked growth of stray dog population on campus for the deer death, a wildlife activist from the varsity,   said, “It’s not that human involvement in such incidents can be entirely ruled out, for in the past we have found poachers using trained dogs to attack deer. But this time, the fact that the carcass was intact, complete with antlers, prove that there couldn’t have been poachers at play. There were bite marks on the hind side of the deer indicating a stray dog attack.”
 
 In fact, the animal activist community within the varsity has been crying hoarse about stray dog attacks on wildlife for years now. However, the authorities have not taken any stringent steps to curb the menace, they rue. With summer approaching, the conflict between stray dogs and wildlife like boars, peacocks and deer will only increase, they say, calling for strict measures to be undertaken to protect the hapless wildlife.
