NEW DELHI:   has demanded a high-level probe into Delhi government’s decision to use public money to fight a defamation case against CM  . BJP MLAs met   Anil Baijal on Wednesday to submit a memorandum in this regard. 

 BJP MLA Vijender Gupta, leader of the opposition in the Delhi assembly, said: “We have demanded a high-level probe into the Delhi government’s decision to make the payment of Rs 3.86 crores to Kejriwal’s counsel, Ram Jethmalani, in the defamation case against Arun Jaitley. The probe should be conducted in a timebound manner so that guilty could be brought to book and penalized for betraying public faith.” 
 
 Gupta alleged that the matter is serious as repeated efforts were made by the Kejriwal-led AAP government to keep the case file away from the LG. “Deputy CM clearly wrote on the file in December 2016 that ‘this file need not be sent to LG for his approval’. He also directed that GAD ( ) ‘shall ensure compliance of these directions at the earliest preferably in a day”. This shows that efforts were made to hide things,” said Gupta.
