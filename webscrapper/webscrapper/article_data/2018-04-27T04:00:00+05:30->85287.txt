Rajkot: Una town in Gir-Somnath district remained tense on Thursday following threats issued to the flogging victims by some of the accused on Wednesday. The alleged threats have come in wake of the Una flogging victims and other members of Dalit community planning to renounce Hindu religion on April 29.  The victims of Una flogging along with nearly 2,000 others will embrace Buddhism in Mota Samdhiyara village of Una next week at a mega function where people from all over the state and Maharashtra are expected to assemble.  The organizers claim that nearly 5,000 people are expected to witness the event. Considering the big gathering security in Una has been tightened. Gir-Somnath superintendent of police, Hitesh Joisar told TOI, “We have tightened security but have not yet received the details of the programme from the organizer. We will finalize the security deployment plan by Friday. First, we will deploy personnel from Gir-Somnath district police and if required will demand police force from nearby districts.” Workers of Ambedkar Yuva Kranti Sangathan, Dalit Adhikar Manch, Navsarjan, Dalit Yuva Sangathan and Rashtriya Dalit Adhikar Sangathan will remain present at the event.  Kirit Rathod, a Dalit activist and one of the organizers of the event, said, “We have distributed pamphlets all over Gujarat. People from Maharashtra have also been invited. Members of the Bhartiya Bauddh Mahasabha and other Buddhist people will also join us.”
