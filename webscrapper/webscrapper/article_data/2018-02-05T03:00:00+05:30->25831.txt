Margao: A proposal to have a town hall near the South Goa district and sessions court, Margao, was mooted by town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai on Sunday.  He said this at the weekly Sunday Dialogue programme near the Holy Spirit church. While interacting with residents, Sardesai said the town hall can be built at the site where a non-conventional energy park project was supposed to come up. The Goa Energy Development Agency had acquired land for the energy park. “That project has been shelved and central funds received for it have been returned. The Margao Municipal Council (MMC) can examine the new proposal once the land is transferred to it,” he said. When Maddel residents drew his attention towards the release of open sewage into nullahs and drains with the PWD failing to act on their complaints, the minister said, “The issue will be resolved once the north trunk sewerage pipeline is connected as the existing pipeline is in a dilapidated condition and needs to be replaced. ”
