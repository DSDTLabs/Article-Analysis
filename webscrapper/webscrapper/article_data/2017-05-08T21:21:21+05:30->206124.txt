Bhopal: “Woh Mujhe Mama Kehta Tha. Meri Ankhon Ke Samne Mere Bacche Ka Collar Pakad Kar Gaadi Ke Saath Ghasita Aur Sir Tanker Se Takra Dia. Mera Baccha Mar Gaya Mai Kuch Nahi Kar Paaya (The accused Shiva Patil used to call me uncle. They grabbed the collar of my son and started the vehicle; they dragged him and threw him on a tanker. All this in front of me but I could not do anything to save him),” Abdul Saeed, father of the deceased Salman, 25, alleged while talking to TOI. 

 A sobbing Saeed said the accused and his son had never quarrelled in the past and were friendly. “I have lost everything, It is unbelievable, can you believe anyone who calls you ‘mama’ will do such a thing with your child? There were no disputes between them as far as I know. It’s a shock to the family. They were in an inebriated state and it’s not just the four who are suspected to have committed this crime. I suspect there were others too involved in the crime. Soon after the incident, some of them escaped on their motorcycles,” Saeed said. 
 
 “Salman had only gone out to rescue his younger brother Sohail, but he was beaten and dragged along with the car, before being thrown and run over,” he alleged. 
 
 Salman’s family was mourning his death and their relatives had assembled at the house in Shanti Nagar. The locality wore a deserted look and nobody was willing to talk about the incident. There were hardly any pedestrians on the street barring the group of mourners and the cops, on Sunday evening. 
 
 Body of Salman was brought to the house in the evening after the autopsy and legal procedures. Heavy police force was deployed at the locality to avert any untoward incident.
 
 “There is no tension in the area but we are taking all precautions and thus the security has been tightened in the locality,” said an official.
