Miley Cyrus' father   said there is not much misconception about the singer as she has always been an open book. 

 Billy Ray, who plays a washed-up country star trying to hold onto fame while doing his best to maintain a relationship with his daughter in hit series 'Still The King', said his real-life daughter cannot fake her behaviour.
 
  
  
 
 "She is such an open book. There is really not a lot of misconception in some ways because she has been very open. She's so real. If she's doing a scene on Saturday Night Live or being Miley in the kitchen or at her house or  , she's just so undeniably Miley there's only one Miley," he said.
