PUNE: Increase in instances of   over the Indian subcontinent could be the result of a spike in intensity of cosmic rays across the globe, according to a study conducted by scientists from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology ( ), Pune.

 The study found a 2% to 3 % rise in cloud cover and lightening activities over the Indian subcontinent in the last 15 years, which could possibly be connected to an increase in intensity of cosmic rays, which have spiked by 3.5 % across the globe.
 
 Devendraa  , scientist,  , told TOI that the research, which was published in the international journal, Survey in Geophysics, in March this year, reviewed numerous past and recent studies on the link among cosmic rays, climate, lightning and human health.   in Varanasi was also involved in the study.
 
 Cosmic rays are high-energy radiation -- originating mainly outside the solar system, including distant galaxies -- reaching the earth’s surface. “Satellite observations and numerical modelling from IITM have suggested a 3 % increase in cloud cover over the Indian subcontinent, possibly due to an increase of about 1.5 watt per square metre (Wm-2) of incoming energy (solar as well as  ) from solar system in the last 15 years, from 1999 to 2014,” said Siingh.
 
 Siingh said this indicated an increase in intensity of cosmic rays by 3.5 %. “The consequent increase in cloud cover has led to an increase not only in thunderstorm activities over the Indian subcontinent but also in convective available potential energy (CAPE), which is known to increase lightning flashes in the same proportion,” said Siingh.
 
 Explaining how cosmic rays result in increasing lightning activities, Siingh said that lightning is initiated by enormous cosmic rays from the solar system. “These cosmic rays generate a considerable number of ‘ionized’ particles. The flux produced by these systems ultimately leads to formation of clouds and, consequently, lightning activities,” said Siingh.
