AMRITSAR: Punjab leader of opposition and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Sukhpal Singh   visited   village under Ajnala assembly constituency on Tuesday to express solidarity with the family of farmer Major Singh who had ended his life due to heavy burden of debt on Monday. 

 Talking to newspersons, Khaira said rising incidents of suicides by farmers was an alarming trend as the Congress government had failed in fulfilling its promise of 100% farm debt waiver. Citing the suicide note left by deceased farmer, Khaira said Major had categorically mentioned “Captain” and “Congress government,” and as per the law of the land, people responsible for forcing the farmer to commit suicide should be brought to book. 
 
 He said chief minister   should give adequate compensation to the family of the deceased and also offer a government job to the son of the victim.
