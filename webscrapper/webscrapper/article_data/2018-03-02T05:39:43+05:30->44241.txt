Punjab finance minister   aims to make the state revenue surplus in next four years. However, the latest monthly key indicators of the state government accounts don’t inspire much confidence in his possible success, at least for now.

 Reason: Against the total estimated revenue as well as capital receipts for 2017-18, amounting to Rs 83,251.94 crore, the state has barely been able to recover 48.47%, or Rs 40,355.64 crore till December 2017.
 
 
 
  
 
 When questioned about presentation of unrealistic figures in the 2017-18 budget,   said, “In fact, we had left a gap of Rs 10,000 crore that we thought we would be able to cover during the course of the year.”
 
 The government, explained Manpreet, was also not aware how the Goods and Services Tax ( ) would pan out and what kind of benefits it would provide the state. He attributed another reason for the 2017-18 budget oversight. “There has been some additional burden on account of salaries which we had not anticipated. The last government announced some dearness allowance (DA) and increments for employees just before they left, which we were not able to really guess.”
 
 The accounts for the corresponding period of December 2016 reveal that the SAD-BJP coalition had been able to recover 75.17% of its estimated revenue targets for 2016-17. Punjab was supposed to achieve zero revenue deficit from 2011-12 onwards. However, the revenue deficit has shown an increase with every passing year — from Rs 6,811 crore in 2011-12 to Rs 14,784.87 crore in 2017-18. Given the present financial condition, Punjab’s outstanding debt at the end of this financial year could surpass the estimated figure of Rs 1.95 lakh crore.
 
 “We are truly in a debt trap,” agreed the finance minister. Debt servicing is what is bleeding Punjab. Every month, debt alone accounts for around an average of Rs 3,000 crore. Over that, around Rs 2,000 crore goes for disbursement of salaries to around 3.5 lakh employees. Also, about Rs 1,000 crore has to be disbursed for pensions.
 
 The Punjab government has postponed the decision to come up with governmentowned liquor vends this year because of logistics issues. The step was aimed at generating around Rs 2,000 crore revenue and stop liquor smuggling.
 
 At the same time, the   government has curtailed the total capital expenditure on acquiring assets like construction of buildings and purchase of land and it amounts to Rs 1,277.94 crore till December 2017, which is not a healthy sign for a developing state. In 2016-17, the SAD-BJP government had made capital expenditure of Rs 3,391.38 crore in the corresponding period.
 
 The power subsidy amount has also increased from Rs 8,966 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 10,255 crore in 2017-18. The state government had failed to pay salaries to employees in time which it had earlier been paying from the value-added tax (VAT) collection close to Rs 1,400 crore and state government’s share in the central taxes. But after GST roll out in July last year, VAT has been subsumed in the GST and the state government is getting the GST amount after a gap of one month.
 
 In its first year, the Congress government also failed to release its 40% share of the various Central government schemes, including the midday meal scheme, thereby resulting in non-disbursement of the remaining 60% amount by the Centre. Eyeing municipal bodies’ elections, the state government also refrained from imposing any new tax till date, but how long can the government survive without introduction of any new taxes has to be seen.
 
 When the Congress government took over in Punjab, it was left with around Rs 13,000 crore of unpaid liabilities. As of now, the state government still has around Rs 8,000 crore unpaid liabilities. “For this, I am really sorry for the people as some part of it is employees’ GPF, pending payments of projects. It is very embarrassing for a state like Punjab not to be able to pay it on time,” said Manpreet.
 
 Punjab government last year decided to reduce stamp duty on property registration in urban areas from 9% to 6%. But Manpreet revealed there has been a shortfall in stamp duty collection as the real estate sector did not pick up as expected.
