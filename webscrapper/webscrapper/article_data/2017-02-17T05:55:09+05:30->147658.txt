NEW DELHI: The   (EC) on Thursday said defence minister Manohar Parrikar’s “bribery” remark was in violation of model code of conduct but let him off with advice to be “more circumspect and careful” with his public utterances in the future.

 Rejecting claims of the senior   leader that the CD carrying his purported remarks has been tampered with and that the translation of his statement from Konkani to English is faulty, the commission said that public utterances of leaders, especially those who occupy high constitutional positions, “which even remotely give the indication of condoning act of accepting bribe in connection with election, are not acceptable”.
 
 Such utterances, it noted, amount to encouraging bribery which, apart from being an electoral offence, is also a corrupt practice”.
 
 Parrikar was quoted by EC as having told a public meeting in Chimbel, Goa on January 29: “You vote by taking Rs 2,000 from someone. It is ok. Someone will hold a rally. There is no objection, if someone roams there with Rs 500. But you should keep in mind that vote shall come to lotus only”.
 
 The poll panel said all leaders, especially those who occupy high constitutional positions, are expected to ensure and promote the sanctity of electoral process.
 
 It said Parrikar’s remarks violate these norms.
 
 AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal and   (GFP) had approached the EC against Parrikar.
 
 Rajya Sabha MP Shantaram Naik, meanwhile, demanded that Parrikar resign from the Union’s council of ministers for his remarks, while the GFP said, “The EC has different rules for different sets of people.” It questioned why an FIR had not been filed against Parrikar.
