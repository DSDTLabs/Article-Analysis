MUMBAI: The   has come under fire from corporators for going lenient on road engineers ahead of the release of the second part of the road scam probe report, expected this week. On indications that the report is likely to indict fewer engineers than before, corporators have alleged that the civic administration is bowing to pressure from the engineers’ union.

 To that the administration says that the reason fewer engineers may be indicted this time around is because when the first inquiry began, engineers became cautious and ensured that roads under their areas of responsibility were done properly. Corporators aren’t willing to buy this theory and also say that even the first time, the punishment meted out was mainly fines of a few thousand rupees and stopping increments—minuscule compared to the scale of the scam (Rs 352 crore), and thus unlikely to be of any deterrent value. The second part of the probe is on misappropriation by contractors of Rs 959 crore.
 
 The inquiry panel, which was to submit its report by January 31, sought an extension from the municipal commissioner till February 14. A source said it is likely the report would be out this week. A civic official said that many engineers during the first phase of the probe found out that 200 engineers were being eyed by the probe panel and so became cautious about their work. “Therefore, in the inquiry’s second phase, the number of engineers likely to be indicted appears to be lower. But if engineers punished after the first phase are found guilty again, their punishment will be increased.” The report on punishments was submitted by the municipal commissioner to the mayor on January 6.
 
  
 
 An angry corporator, Manoj Kotak ( ), said, “The scam was worth crores of rupees and cannot be justified by meager fines and stopping of increments.” Opposition leader   said it was time the   chose companies of repute to construct Mumbai's roads.
