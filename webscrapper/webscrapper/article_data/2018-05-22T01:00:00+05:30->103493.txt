Bollywood films are known to show wedding sangeet functions and parties with pomp and extravagance. And there is always that perfect dance number, which gets the whole khandaan on the dance floor. In ' ', led by four ladies   Khan,   Ahuja,   and  , there is a sangeet sequence with all the usual show-sha, but with a twist. In the upcoming song ' ', the four friends will be seen having a blast at the bride Kalindi’s (played by Kareena) sangeet. The gal pals are in high spirits (a few extra shots that is), they mess up their steps for the dance performance and they don’t exactly behave like the bride’s besties are supposed to. It’s far from the perfect sangeet, but that’s what adds madness and fun to the usual wedding revelry. The lyrics of 'Pappi' are penned by Shellee with music by Shashwat Sachdev, who has also sung for it along with Sunidhi Chauhan.
