MUMBAI: If an eight-hour work shift for police personnel is to be en forced across the state, more than 1 lakh personnel--or 50% of the current force--will have to be recruited, state police chief   told TOI on Wednesday.

 “As of now, there are 2,22,035 posts in the Maharashtra police, of which 2.10 lakh are occupied. The state will have to create 1.11lakh more posts to go ahead with the eight-hour work shifts,“ Mathur told TOI.
 
 Last year, Mumbai top cop   launched an eight-hour work shift on a trial basis at Deonar police station.Of the city's 93 police stations, 43 have begun implementing the new timings, with eight more planning to join next month.
 
 “Currently , there is a serious staff crunch in the police department, making it impossible to implement this scheme across the state,“ Mathur told TOI in Aurangabad.
 
 A senior officer from Mumbai said that feedback to the shift system has been excellent so far.
