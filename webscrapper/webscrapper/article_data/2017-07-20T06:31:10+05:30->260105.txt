LUCKNOW: The Lucknow Municipal Corporation is ready to launch its   payment system next week. It was scheduled to get functional in May but was delayed because updating data of all zones was taking time. “Since a lot of time has gone into correcting the system, people are not left with much time to avail of the 10% discount on paying   before July 31, hence we plan to extend the deadline to August 31,” said an   official.

 The online tax system will help users assess tax on their own and even get it verified before online payment. The system will generate an e-receipt of payment and update credit against a house number instantly. Earlier, though people got the online receipt, updating their accounts took months as it had to be done manually in the account books. In the new system, the amount will reflect instantly. 
 
 The system could not be launched in June because of threat posed by the Chinese malware that hacked several accounting and revenue collection systems. “Many government projects fell prey to the malware and we faced some data loss too, so we postponed the launch,” said an official. The software was handed over to NIC to re-strengthen security arrangements. The agency is currently conducting the final test and would hand over the system for launch by next week.
