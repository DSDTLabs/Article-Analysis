Jaipur: After a long delay, the budgetary promise of laying 20,000 kilometers of roads has finally received some momentum.

 Malaysian firm DMIA, which signed a MoU with the government during Resurgent Rajasthan to construct about 4,000km of roads, will submit the final detailed project report (DPR) on February 21.
 
 After dillydallying for almost 18 months, the company will submit the report to Public Works Department (PWD) on ‘package number 6’ to construct 610km of roads at a cost of Rs 1,036 crore. The PWD has offered 61 roads under seven packages to firms covering 4,000km. The total amount required for the purpose comes to Rs 7,176 crore.
 
 According to officials, the DPR has to be approved by the empowered committee before the government issues bidding notices under the Swiss Channel Method.
 
 As per the Swiss Channel Method, the government will allow other developers to bid against the proposal submitted by the Malaysian firm. If the government receives a better proposal, the Malaysian company will be given the first opportunity to match it. If it fails to do so, the contract will be awarded to the second proposer.
 
 The Malaysian firm will also submit DPRs for packages 5 and 7 by March 15.
