PUDUCHERRY: Tension prevailed at the legislative assembly in the Union territory of   on Tuesday after   members led by legislature party leader   staged a protest demanding that the   government provide rice, sugar and other four essential commodities free of cost for all ration cardholders ahead of the Pongal festival in Puducherry.

 The government has been disbursing essential commodities free of cost through the fair price shops during   and Pongal festivals every year. However, the government could not distribute essential commodities free of cost for the Diwali festival last year following lt governor  's recommendation to extend freebies only to the needy and deserving — red cardholders — and not to all ration cardholders.
