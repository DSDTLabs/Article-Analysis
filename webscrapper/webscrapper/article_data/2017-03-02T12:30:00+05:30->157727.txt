Teenagers who consume a diet high in soft drinks, red and processed meat and low in vegetables may be at increased risk of developing  .
Researchers collected data from about 45,204 women who had participated in a questionnaire in 1991 about their diet in high school, when participants were 27 to 44 years.
 
 "Because breast cancer takes many years to arise, we were curious whether such a diet during the early phases of a woman's life is a risk factor for breast cancer," said Karin Michels, professor at University of California.Each woman's diet was given an inflammatory score using a method that linked diet with inflammatory markers in the blood.
 
 During 22 years of followup, 870 women were diagnosed with premenopausal breast cancer and 490 were diagnosed with postmenopausal breast cancer. Researchers then divided the women into five groups based on the inflammatory score of their adolescent diet.
 
 Those in the highest score group had a 35% higher risk for breast cancer relative to those in the lowest score group. Based on early adulthood diet, those in the highest inflammatory score group had a 41% higher risk.
