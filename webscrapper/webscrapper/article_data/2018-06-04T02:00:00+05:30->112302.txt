PATNA: The state tourism department is set to inaugurate a 100-feet tall statue of Lord Buddha in the middle of Ghora Katora lake at Rajgir in Nalanda district by the end of this month. The statue has been built by the Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation (BSTDC) with an expenditure of Rs 48.41 crore.

 BSTDC managing director Inayat Khan said almost 95% of work for erecting the statue had already been completed.
 
 Tourism department officials said a cafeteria and ten guestrooms would be developed around the lake for the tourists. Visitors will also able to enjoy joyrides in the lake on motor boats and paddle boats. Ten pergolas with benches will also be set up for tourists. 
 
 The tourism department has also spent Rs 47.14 crore for the development of anti-coaching camp, eco-friendly toilets and a watch tower at Ghora Katora. In a bid to make the areas near the lake lush green, more than 16,971 saplings have been planted.
 
 Ghora Katora (horse’s bowl) lake is surrounded by hilly mountains and dense forest. It is believed to be the place where stable of Jarasandha, a famous character from the Hindu mythological epic Mahabharata, was situated. The lake has become a popular picnic spot as it is also close to Vishwa Shanti Stupa, the peace pagoda at Ratnagiri hills.
 
 Motor vehicles are banned near the lake and it can only be reached by horse-drawn cart or tonga and bicycle. “The e-transport facilities are being provided by the forest department. We are also planning to start battery-operated vehicles for the convenience of the tourists,” Khan said. 
 
 Chief minister Nitish Kumar had visited the lake on December 31 last year to reviewe the progress of installation of Lord Buddha’s statue. He had instructed the officials concerned to ensure that enough space is provided below the hanging bridges being constructed on both sides of the statue to allow boats to pass easily under it.
