 Former Rajya Sabha member from Puducherry P Kannan, DMK, AIADMK and other political parties too came down heavily on the BJP leader for his comments. Kannan, while condemning the violence unleashed against the   in Tripura, slammed the BJP leader and sought the BJP leadership to sack him.
 
 Raja in his post, which he deleted later, questioned the connection between communist leader Lenin and India in an effort to support the demolition of Lenin’s statue in Tripura after the BJP emerged victorious in the recent assembly polls in the north-eastern state. He went on to say that like Lenin’s statues, Periyar’s statues (in Tamil Nadu) will also see the same fate, leading to widespread protests from leaders of different political parties.
