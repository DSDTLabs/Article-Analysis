MUMBAI: A   on Thursday sentenced a 44-year-old man to   for the   of his wife and a colleague who attempted to save her when he attacked her in 2013. 

 The accused   attacked his wife Seema Inchal's (30) after over suspicions that she was having an affair with another of his co-workers Mitesh Ghonge (30). Ghonge was also injured in the attack and was the key witness in the trial.
 
 The court had found the accused guilty on Tuesday. On Thursday the court pronounced the sentence after hearing arguments from both sides.
 
 The incident took place on January 7, 2013. Ghonge told court that in the afternoon that day, he received a call from Inchal asking him why heâ€™d called his wife after seeing his missed call on her phone. Inchal then asked Ghonge to come his house at Saki Naka. Ghonge went there along with the other victim Rajendra Rane (40).
 
 Ghonge alleged Inchal confronted his wife and slapped her. When Rane and he tried to intervene, Inchal took her to the kitchen. After sometime the victim began to scream. He alleged that when Rane and he ran into the kitchen, they saw Inchal stabbing Seema. Ghonge said when they tried to overpower the accused, he stabbed Rane in the stomach and chest. He alleged that as Rane and Seema collapsed, Ghonge tried to reason with Inchal. But he too was assaulted. It was only after his pleading that Inchal calmed down and opened the door.
 
 Ghonge said he ran to the police station and informed the cops. While he rushed to the hospital, Inchal was arrested. Inchal's defence denied the incident.
