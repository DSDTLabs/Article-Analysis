KOLKATA: A homemaker preparing   at her   was saved by a whisker when a KMC dumper   broke through the walls of her house and came to a stop just before invading into the kitchen.

 The   took place on EM Bypass when the truck carrying garbage from Ultadanga to Dhapa crashed into the walls of a roadside hutment around 7am on Tuesday. The driver was speeding towards Science City when a car in front of him stopped before a red signal at Duttabad. The dumper driver applied brake and swerved left to avoid collision but it rode up the pavement and crashed straight into the home of Rupa Banerjee.
 
 “I was still sleepy and was dozing off while preparing tea when there was a deafening sound and my entire house shook. As I came out, I found one of my rooms completely demolished. There was smoke and dust all over and I could not understand what had happened,” Banerjee shuddered.
 
 Banerjee thanked her stars that the room that was demolished did not had any occupant. “My family members were sleeping in the other room. Had the truck hit that room, my husband and children may have suffered major injuries,” she said.
 
 The driver of the dumper, however, suffered serious injuries. He was taken to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital where his situation was stated to be critical.
 
 Local residents said large dumpers carrying garbage are often found speeding and violating traffic signals on EM Bypass on their way towards and way back from Dhapa. “They do not stop at red signals, ply along opposite lanes and even drive rashly. Police do not take any action against them,” said a resident of Duttabad.
 
 On Tuesday, the driver was booked for rash and negligent driving but could not be arrested as he was hospitalized. The truck was initially seized but was later handed over to the KMC.
