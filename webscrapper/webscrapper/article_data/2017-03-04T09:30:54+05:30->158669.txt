BHOPAL: Former chief minister and senior-most MLA in MP Assembly,   on Friday came down heavily on the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government on the issue of   deaths in Sheopur district. During the Question Hour, the veteran   legislator asked minister for women and child   for monthly data on the number of malnutrition deaths in Sheopur between 2015 and 2016.

 When the minister said that there were no malnutrition deaths reported in the district during the two years, Gaur showed her the statistics.
 
 As Chitnis started giving the dates of a nutrition drive by the women and child department in Sheopur and claimed 20,259 children were malnourished, Gaur said, “Do not quote figures. Give me the real picture in the field.” He took out a report by the health department which was submitted to the high court.
 
 “You are saying there have been no deaths due to malnutrition in Sheopur, whereas a report submitted to high court by the health department says there have been 116 deaths and a total 80,000 people were found malnourished. How can two departments have two different findings? Which one is the true report?” the octogenarian BJP MLA asked.
 
 Chitnis argued that malnutrition is a serious issue in the state and more work has to be done to address the issue. She said, “But the parameters of the health department and the women and child department are different on malnutrition. While malnutrition does not lead to death, yet with malnutrition comes diseases which claim lives.”
 
 But the former chief minister was not happy with the answer. He said, “There has to be a probe into malnutrition in Sheopur.” Chitnis said a probe has already been done, but another one will be ordered.
