CHENNAI: Criticising the Tamil Nadu government for attempting to 'induce'   in under-developed areas of Kancheepuram, Vellore and Tiruvallur districts,   and city residents voiced their opposition to the proposed   (CMA) expansion plan.

 On January 22, the government had via notification declared its intent to expand CMA from the current 1,189 sq.km to the proposed 8,878 sq.km, in the process subsuming 1,709   in these three districts. On Monday, the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) organised a workshop at Ripon Buildings to seek comments from stakeholders.
 
 "The proposal should have discussed constituting a Chennai metropolitan region development authority because as it stands, the CMDA will have a free hand to convert agricultural and wet lands to help (real estate) developers," said K P Subramanian, an urban planner. Subramanian has challenged the expansion proposal in the Madras high court.
 
 "Can the CMDA promise us that every one of the 4,200 water bodies in the proposed expansion area will be protected?" asked S Janakarajan, economist and professor at  . "Urbanisation is one-way traffic. There is no going back and so the government must be doubly careful," he added.
 
 Tara Murali, representing Citizen consumer and   (CAG), said the proposal makes clear the government's intent to induce urbanisation. "The expansion proposal is a consumption-based development model. It has no sustainability," she said.
 
 The workshop was attended by bureaucrats including S Krishnan, secretary, housing and urban development department, and Rajesh Lakhoni, member-secretary, CMDA. "Capacity building (to handle the expansion) is happening in parallel," said Krishnan.
