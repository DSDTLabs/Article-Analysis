THANE: A three-year-old filly (female  ) that was lying on the footpath in a critical condition in   was saved by a local NGO, Wildlife Welfare Association (WWA), early on Friday. Officials said that the animal was dehydrated when it was found. 

 “Around midnight, a local called up about the horse which was   up. It seemed dehydrated and almost dying. We took it to   after feeding it sugarcane and gave her water,” said Omkar Kolekar, a volunteer at WWA.
 
 When Kolekar enquired with locals about its, owner, he learnt that the horse had been left alone for more than eight hours. “A few locals said that a small boy was collecting money while he was with the horse, but it was left alone after 4pm,” said Kolekar. “We suspect the animal was dehydrated as she was kept standing in the sun the whole day,” added Kolekar. The animal is now being treated at Thane SPCA. 
 
 “When the horse was got here, she was completely dehydrated and critical and we had to administer saline. She is now responding well but will be under observation for at least four,” said Dr Meghesh Gaikwad, veterinarian at Thane SPCA.
 
 The owner contacted the hospital and said he had gone to get fodder for the animal. “Asked why he was looking for food at midnight, he had no answer,” said Shakuntala Majumdar, president of the Thane SPCA. “We will register a complaint against him.”
