CHENNAI: Angry about the draft Coastal Zone Management Plan, fishermen raised slogans and staged protests at the   of the   at Port Trust’s old dock on   on Friday.

 According to the CRZ 2011, the draft plan should have included the fishermen’s traditional infrastructure, their community space and housing facilities. None of these have been included in the draft plan. “The non-inclusion mainly facilitates construction along the coast. The plan allows for private infrastructure development. There is no mention or efforts to conserve the coastline or the community dependent on it,” said K Bharathi, president of South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association.
 
 Coastal Resources Centre representative   said conducting the public hearing is in violation of the   order, which clearly asked the authorities to mark the hazard line on the map before holding the public hearing. ‘This has not been done by those who prepared the plan,” he said. Also fish landing centres on railway tracks in Royapuram and in a private factory in Ennore, clearly shows the map was not prepared keeping in mind the condition of fishermen and their livelihood, he charged.
 
 The community is also irked that the public hearing which was supposed to be at a common venue for fishermen from   and Chennai, has been changed at the last moment. Fishermen from Tiruvallur now will have to go to Thiruvottiyur. “This has been done deliberately to split the united voice of fishermen,” said Bharathi.
 
 At the venue, district collector V Anbuselvan heard the grievances of the fishermen and also received petitions submitted by the fishermen. While the fishermen insisted that the collector cancell the public hearing, the collector said he would take into consideration the issues and hold another public hearing in this regard.
