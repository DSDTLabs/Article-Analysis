GURUGRAM: The Blue Bells School parents’ association on Saturday lodged a police complaint against the school management, alleging the school had raised its annual fees using approval from an unregistered parent-teacher association, which was secretly formed by the school.

 In their complaint,   said the school raised fees by 10-15% without any consent from parents. Instead, they alleged, it had taken ‘approval’ from an unregistered association. 
 
 Sameer Nasa, whose son is in Class VI, said, “The school management is not willing to speak with us. In the name of development charges, they have been extorting huge amounts from us.” Another parent, Mahesh Yadav, said, “We’re ready to sit with the management to resolve all issues. But if they don’t consider our demands, we’ll take it up further.” Sunil Kumar, head constable at Sector 4 police station, said, “I can’t book the school. It is their internal matter with the parents. The best I can do is arrange a meeting between them.” 
 
 Blue Bells director Suman Gulati said, “We’re open minded people and are willing to talk with anyone.”
