Vadodara: Server room of Dhanlaxmi Bank located on Race Course Road was gutted in fire on Thursday afternoon.

 According to officials, the fire broke out at around 1.30 pm, possibly due to over-heating in the server room on the building’s first floor. “The bank employees on ground floor sensed the burning smell and informed us immediately after they got to know that a fire had broken out,” said Parth Brahmbhatt, fire officer, Vadiwadi fire station.
 
 Fire officials said that the blaze was doused very quickly but since the room was filled with smoke, they had to break the glass window and continue salvaging. Firemen also had to use mechanical exhaust fans so that the smoke could come out quickly. Along with servers, the air-conditioners in the room were also damaged.
 
 Although fire had not spread further to any other room, bank employees, customers and people working in adjoining offices rushed out in panic.
