RAJKOT: In order to strengthen   for better detection of crime,   has launched the ‘Auto rickshawala Police Mitra’ scheme to take auto drivers into confidence for information gathering.

 Surendranagar superintendent of police Deepak Meghani launched the scheme on a pilot basis in four police station areas of   city. The pilot project will be implemented in police stations of ‘A’ division, ‘B’ division,   and Wadhvan.
 
 “We have decided to connect auto drivers with police through the new scheme as they are the ones who ferry unknown people arriving in Surendranagar and drop them at difference places. They can immediately identify suspected elements and inform police about them or their activities. This will help police prevent or detect serious crimes,” said Meghani.
 
 A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was issued by the SP to concerned police stations. He also asked cops to connect with auto drivers and hold regular meetings with them to get alerts and information about suspected elements in their respective areas.
 
 Police said that they will encourage auto drivers whose information leads to major prevention or detection of crime. Police also assured the drivers that their names will be kept confidential.
