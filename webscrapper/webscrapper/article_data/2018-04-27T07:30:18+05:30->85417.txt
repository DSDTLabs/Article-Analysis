SHAHJAHANPUR: It was quieter on Thursday at the house of the rape survivor whose five-year fight against Asaram brought the self-styled godman down.

 
 A day after a Jodhpur court sentenced him to life imprisonment, the media crews had left, the phones were ringing a lot less and the neighbours had gone home. “We had a good night’s sleep after so long,” the girl’s father said. “We laughed a bit, ate well and thanked God for a long time.”
 
 
 
 When the news of the conviction came, the girl, now almost 21, was giving an exam in college. It was difficult for her to concentrate. Moments after she stepped out of the examination hall, her brother called her.
 
 “As soon as she reached home, she first folded her hands and prayed at the temple at home. She stood like that for quite awhile,” said her father. The girl herself said she was happy she got to see “such a momentous day”. Now, she smiled, she will try never to look back.
 
 “The court’s order has given us a lot of courage and hope,” the father said, adding, “Her dream of becoming an IAS officer received a setback following the incident as her studies were disrupted for two years. She is a bright student and has always scored over 85%. She will now start her life afresh and will think of what she wants to become. I will support her, whatever she decides to do.”
 
 He said that many people have visited to congratulate them and that some of them stood by the family through the worst. “We were offered crores by Asaram’s cronies to withdraw the case. We were threatened, harassed, humiliated. The case had disrupted our lives. Our entire family was affected following the incident. My elder son was then 19 years old and as I was busy with the case, he started managing both his studies and our transport business. When our statements were being recorded in the court in 2014-15, our business was hit so hard that revenues went down by 80%. It is slowly picking up.”
