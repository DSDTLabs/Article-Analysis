NEW DELHI: Upset over his mother’s exorcist activities, a 42-year-old man stabbed his mother to death in southwest Delhi’s Palam on Wednesday morning.

 Rajiv Sharma, who works as an MTNL operator, was later arrested from his residence. One of Sharma’s neighbours made a PCR call when he heard Sharma’s 62-year-old mother, Premlata, screaming for help.
 
 When a police team reached the spot, Premlata was lying unconscious and bleeding on the ground. She was rushed to a nearby private hospital, with the help of Sharma’s wife, where Premlata succumbed. 
 
 Police said that Sharma did not try to flee. “A murder case was registered and the weapon used in the crime was also seized,” said Surender Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (southwest). Sharma told the police that he was frustrated with his mother’s exorcist activities and her meetings with tantriks as it had started affecting his children. He said that he had warned her several times not to practice   at home, but she refused to relent. On Wednesday, Sharma had an altercation with Premlata on the same topic, following which he stabbed her.
 
 Sharma told police that his mother had started involving his children in her practice of black magic. She even tried some tricks on them, which she learned from tantriks. Unknown people also visited Premlata at home, which further angered Sharma, police said. Sharma said that she had been involved in these activities for the last four years. A senior police officer said that Premlata sustained one stab wound in the stomach. “It appears that she died of excessive blood loss,” he said.
