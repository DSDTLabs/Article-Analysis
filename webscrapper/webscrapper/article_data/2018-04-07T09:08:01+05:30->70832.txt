BENGALURU: Itis quite common for youngsters to write love letters in blood. But a youth in   district in   has stunned all by writing a six-page bloodletter to Prime Minister  , demanding a government school.

 Vijayaranjan  , 25, from Nalatwad in Muddebihal taluk, used a syringe to extract blood from his arm, inked the letter using a thin brush and sent it to the PM’s office through  . “We were tired of requesting local politicians and officials to sanction a government secondary school and a college for our small town. Students from the lower economic strata are forced to travel 20km every day to reach the government school in Muddebihal,” said Joshi.
 
 Nalatwad has a population of around 15,000. It has a private school and a college but parents struggle to pay for education. “Many youths were angry with the administration as our pleas fell on deaf ears. We’d even petitioned our MLA, education minister and chief minister.” But why a bloodletter? Joshi said: “Our handwritten and typed representations failed to make any impact. We hoped the PM would take note if we wrote the letter in blood.”
