Indore: For the past two days,   near Aurbindo Hospital, is reeling under darkness at evening in absence of electricity. Over   in the village use lanterns and chimney lamps at night thanks to the delay in installation of a   in the area. 

 The residents claimed since Saturday morning the power supply was disrupted. They said that the existing distribution transformer was not working for the past few days. “We have already complained about the power cut, but nothing has been done so far to solve this problem. Despite paying the bills on time, the power company has failed to provide proper supply,” said villager  .
 
 Another villager said that while Discom was replacing old transformers in rural areas to avoid unscheduled power cut, faulty transformer in their village was not replaced despite repeated complaints.
 
 “It’s examination time for students and they have no other option but to use chimney lamps or lanterns to study. Many of us have been paying the bills on time, but we are ignored when it comes to solve power woes. Such delay in restoration of power supply is very common,” he said. 
 
 Officials with Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Ltd, however, refuted the allegations and said that the supply to the village was disrupted due to failure of distribution transformer in the area. 
 
 “We have already brought the transformer for installation, but it was delayed due to Sunday. The transformer would be installed on Monday and supply would be ensured immediately after its installation,” said discom Mangliya deputy engineer (rural) division Anand Ahirwar. 
 
 Some officials also claimed that timely payment of electricity bills is an issue with the consumers of the area. “Hardly 20 percent of the consumers of the area have been paying their bills on time,” they added.
