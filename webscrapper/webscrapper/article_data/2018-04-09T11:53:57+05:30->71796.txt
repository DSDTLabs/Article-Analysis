Actor   was granted bail, but trouble may not be over for him yet. Bail was granted bail by a court in Jodhpur, yesterday evening, in the 20 year old blackbuck poaching case. And   Khan is now a free man. However, trouble may not be over for the Bollywood superstar yet. 

 The actor will have to return to Jodhpur on May 7, and go to the same court that released him on bail. This will be for his next hearing in the blackbuck poaching case. 
 
  
  
 
 Salman will seek a formal suspension of his conviction in May. 
 
 However, if the court sticks to its earlier verdict and does not grant bail, then Salman might have to go to jail all over again.
 Also, the other troublemaker for the actor could be the   community.
 
 This community is now planning to approach the   challenging the bail ordered by  . 
 
  
  
 Once the case reaches the High Court, it will be scrutinised right from the beginning. And then if found guilty, Salman might have to go behind the bars. 
 If the Higher courts deny him bail, then there would be absolutely no chance for the actor, Salman to come out of prison before completion of his sentence. These hypothetical scenarios are also practical at the same time.
