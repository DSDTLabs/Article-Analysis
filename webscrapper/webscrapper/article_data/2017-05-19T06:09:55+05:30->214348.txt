VADODARA: The   (VMC) on Friday decided to postpone razing Sahakarnagar settlement in Tandalja that has over 1,400 dwellings, mainly of people from the minority community. 

 The razing has been on the cards since October when the civic body gave a public notice to residents there asking them to vacate their houses.   from Dariapur Ahmedabad, Gyasuddin Sheikh, had also raised the issue chief minister Vijay Rupani. Sheikh had sought that the razing drive should be postponed till June 30 as the holy month of Ramzan began on May 26. Earlier in the day, similar representations were made by activists as well as state Congress general secretary Narendra Ravat to the municipal commissioner Dr Vinod Rao.
 
 Late on Thursday evening, Rao said that the civic body had decided to put on hold the drive after the residents agreed to give an undertaking in writing that they would vacate the houses by June 30. “They have agreed to give us the undertaking by Friday evening,” said Rao. In November last year, VMC had postponed the demolition of Sahakarnagar in Tandalja in wake of demonetisation. But sources claim that the civic body would have landed into legal complications had it gone ahead with the razing of 1,428 houses and 78 shops. The holders of these properties were to be rehabilitated at the same site in a scheme that was to be taken up under a public-private partnership (PPP) mode. After demonetisation, VMC stated that it was postponing the razing drive as people were facing hardships.Activists who are working to help Sahakarnagar residents said that one of the major bone of contention was the ownership of the land where the settlement stood. “The VMC is yet to get the possession of the land. A part of it is a waterbody on paper even if only a swamp exists at the site today,” said an activist.
