LUDHIANA:Moving ahead with the ongoing demolition drive, a team of   (Glada) razed eight illegal colonies located in the outskirts of Ludhiana on Friday, where construction was in the initial stages. In this month itself (March1-9), the department has taken action against 31 illegal colonies. Friday’s demolition drive was the third in a row since Wednesday.

 Glada estate officer   said the demolition drive was conducted in eight colonies located in the villages of Ayali Kalan, Chuharpur, and Ladian Kalan. He added that more such demolition drives against unauthorized colonies would be carried out in the coming days, and they had razed infrastructure like sewerage, electric polls, and roads during the drive.
 
 Glada chief administrator   said: “If any new illegal colony is developed under Glada jurisdiction, it will be demolished and an FIR lodged against the erring developer. We have also asked the departments concerned not to provide any power supply and telephone connections in the illegal colonies, in addition to the government’s ban on registering deeds in such colonies.”
 
 Glada has also requested the public not to invest in such colonies. However, the department is also waiting for a new policy for regularization of illegal colonies. For that, the department has sought suggestions from developers in case they wanted any changes in the upcoming policy, but the developers have not shown much interest.
