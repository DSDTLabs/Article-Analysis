Gone are the days when the neighbourhood park had a few slides, swings and a track for walkers/joggers. Authorities, it would seem, have awoken to the idea that children and adults alike are pressed for time and squeeze very little physical activity into their day-to-day routine. Which is, perhaps, why a large number of parks these days have adapted gym equipment like cross-trainers, hip twisters adn ski walkers, among others, in colourful yet weather-proof versions.
 What’s interesting is that the city’s   brigade has taken a shine to these parks and on a quick stroll through any such area in town they can be seen busy incorporating a little more than just a walk into their   routine.
 For 62-year-old Hoysala Rajyashree, an   in the vicinity of her home proved to be a blessing in disguise. “I have been battling several   issues and my doctor advised me to incorporate exercise into my daily routine to stay healthy. 
  Going to an open gym is not only cost effective, it also allows me to enjoy nature and fresh air, while also packing in some exercise,” she says.
  While the greenery at these parks is also a draw for sexagenarian MK Balasubramanya, he adds that the fact that the equipment is simple and user-friendly helps people like him. “Their usage does not require any professional guidance. Moreover, you can visit it at any time of the day based on your convenience,” he says.
