VADODARA: The residents of Sahakarnagar in   gave undertakings individually to the   (VMC) assuring the civic body that they would vacate the houses by June 30 and hand them over to the civic body. Much to the surprise and relief of   officials, persons who were in possession of the dwellings made a beeline to sign the undertakings.

 Besides the assurance that the dwellings and shops will be vacated by June 30, the undertakings state that the signatories would withdraw a suit filed in the Gujarat high court and submit the copy of the undertakings to the court. It adds that the residents would not object to a razing drive in the monsoon and shall not take any legal objections to the process.
 
 VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao said that the representatives who had objected to the razing drive earlier too welcomed the VMCâ€™s stand and assured of cooperation in the days to come. He said that the residents too would not wait till the last moment to vacate the houses.
