Mysuru: Along with the city mayor MJ Ravikumar, deputy commissioner D Randeep, district in-charge minister   formally invited the member of the Mysuru royal family   on Monday.

 Assuring the minister and the district administration of full cooperation for the   celebrations, Pramoda Devi said, “Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar and Trishikha Kumari will participate in the Paada Puja, and all the other key rituals. The Khas Durbar will be held from September 21 to 29 where both of them will be present.”
 
 Pramoda Devi, however, chose to steer clear of the controversy surrounding the demand for the installation of a statue of former MP and royal family member Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar at a junction close to the Mysuru Palace. She said that there were no differences with the state government on the issue. “I have not written to the government on the matter, and will not comment on the subject at this juncture,” said Pramoda Devi.
 
 Mahadevappa, also the public works minister, expressed his delight over the support extended by the   for the ‘Naada Habba’ celebrations. “Dasara celebrations will be inaugurated on September 21 at 8.45am atop Chamundi Hills by poet Nissar Ahmed, who will arrive in Mysuru on September 20,” the minister said. Mahadevappa also handed a cheque for Rs 36 lakh from the state government to Pramoda Devi on the occasion. 
 
 On road repair work in the city being delayed, Mahadevappa said, “Incessant rainfall has hampered asphalting work. If the roads are asphalted when there is rain, work will go waste since the quality of the work will leave a lot to be desired. Road work planned ahead of Dasara will now be taken up next month once the rainfall recedes.”
 
 Mahadevappa also expressed his grief over the death of Congress leader and former minister Qamarul Islam. “His death is a huge loss to the state,” he added.
