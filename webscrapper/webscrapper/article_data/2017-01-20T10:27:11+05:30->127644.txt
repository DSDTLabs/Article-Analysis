CHENNAI: Trust antiestablishmentarian ire to spur a movement.

 “There’s no place for politicians here,” one of the student protesters shouted, a war cry for the thousands of young people who had gathered on   on Thursday. The crowd erupted in loud cheers.
 
 Young speakers, all in black, took turns to keep the crowds charged up and around 3pm, as the numbers really began to swell, one of the speakers vowed to the crowd that he would not vote until the authorities lifted the ban on jallikattu.
 
 “Surrender your Aadhaar and  ,” another speaker said. “Let’s put them in a box and send them to the Election Commission as a mark of disapproval.”
 
 Thunderous applause greeted an old man in the crowd who rose and surrendered his voter ID card. Hundreds followed him and gave up the government-issued cards.
 
 “Until Thursday night, we collected 1,700 Aadhaar and voter ID cards,” one of the organisers of the protest, IT professional L Thulasiraman, said. “We plan to go around on a vehicle and collect ID cards from the crowds on Friday.”
 
 Another organiser, J Harish, a former student of Chettinadu College of Engineering and Technology and software professional, said, “All of us gathered here and have found support in each other. The protest is a joint effort of students from several colleges and young professionals.”
 
 Students from scores of engineering, arts and science, medical and law colleges in the city took part in the protest. But there were others too.
 
 V Ganesh, 40, a general physician, joined the students. “It is a great feeling to join the college kids in protest,” he said. “I brought a drum to keep the crowds energised. I started at Gandhi statue and by the time I reached Thanthai Periyar Maaligai, we had formed a large group.”
