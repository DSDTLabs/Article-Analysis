THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   N C Asthana has issued a circular stating that the investigating officers need not strictly go by the advice given by the legal advisers of vigilance.

This gave enough breathing space for the political bosses to make a politically-motivated choice," sources said. 
 
 At present there are seven legal advisers for the   in the state.
