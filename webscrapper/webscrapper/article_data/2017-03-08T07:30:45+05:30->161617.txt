BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh government has hiked the honorarium for those detained during the Emergency from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000 per month, taking it at par with the pension received by freedom fighters.

 Minister of state (MoS) for   (GAD)   announced the hike during a debate on the supplementary proposals of Budget for 2017-18. “We have hiked the monthly pension of MISA detainees and freedom fighters from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000. As of today, MP has 2,604 Loktantra Senanis and 750 freedom fighters,” he told the House during the debate. He further informed the assembly that the government has decided to respectfully call detainees of   Act (MISA) as   (democracy warrior). 
 
 Earlier in the day, the Congress members opposed the proposal related to the MISA detainees and sought to know the number of such beneficiaries. The opposition legislators also questioned the prudence of the ruling regime to go for a pension hike. “With this, Madhya Pradesh has virtually equated MISA detainees with freedom fighters. This is the second time after December 2011 that the MP assembly has raised the honorarium or pension to MISA detainees,” they said.
 
 Earlier, in December 2011, the honorarium was raised from Rs 6,000 to Rs 15,000. Some other BJP-ruled states also pay such honorarium to MISA detainees who were jailed during the 21-month emergency imposed in 1975. Madhya Pradesh is the only state in the country where those detained under the MISA during the Emergency get such a high amount in monthly honorarium.
 
 In 2008, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government started giving money to MISA detainees under the Lok Nayak Jaiprakash Narayan Honorarium Rules-2008 — made for extending assistance to those who were detained for political or social reasons during the 1975-1977 Emergency when civil liberties were suspended, political opponents jailed and the press muzzled.
