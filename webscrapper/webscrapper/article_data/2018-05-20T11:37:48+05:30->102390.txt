LUCKNOW: In a fresh canine attack incident in  , a 55-year-old woman was targeted by a pack of three dogs on Saturday. The incident took place at   in   police station area. 

 The woman, Shivrani, had gone to the fields at around 2.30pm when a pack of three dogs pounced upon her. 
 
  "I fell on the ground. As I fell, one of the dogs dug his teeth in my neck and then almost chewed my leg above the ankle. I kept screaming in pain till villagers came and chased away the dogs. The villagers then informed police and administration," said Shivrani. 
 
 Even as the district administration has been repeatedly claiming of having neutralised most dogs involved in the attack, the canines seem to be getting more brazen with the Saturday attack having many new elements.
 
 It was for the first time when an adult was targeted by dogs. 
 
 Besides, the dogs usually attacked early morning but on Saturday, it was later afternoon. Animal behavioural experts, vets, and forest officials have failed to unravel the reasons behind the continuous attacks.
 
 Sitapur district magistrate Sheetal Verma said that Shivrani was admitted to the district hospital where here condition is stable. 
 
 "Shivrani told us that the attack was carried out by dogs. Only 4-5 dogs are left in Khairabad area and probably only they are attacking villagers," Verma said.
