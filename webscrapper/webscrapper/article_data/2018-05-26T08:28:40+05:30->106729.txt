SHILLONG: Campaigning at Latri and Sonabil for Clement Momin, the National People's Party (NPP) candidate for the   bypoll, Manipur deputy chief minister   and sports and youth affairs minister   on Friday launched a scathing attack on   and the Congress party. 

 "Mukul Sangma and the Congress party was never concerned for the people and the future of Ampati constituency. Very few roads were created and infrastructure was not developed much in the constituency. The educational facilities in Ampati and   are very poor, which is a testimony to the fact that they failed to create an environment for the future of our children," said Yumnam Joykumar Singh.
 
 "He (Mukul Sangma) failed to create basic facilities in education, health, social security and economic stability. He just created a perception of development, but that is not a reality," Singh alleged. 
 
 Letpao Haokip said the byelection is very important for NPP which currently has 20 MLAs in the  . "If the people of Ampati give us the mandate, we will emerge as the single largest party in Meghalaya. NPP is a new party and has been able to expand its reach to different parts of the country. We urge the people to strengthen us further, so that we can continue to work to create better infrastructure and facilities for our people," Hakip said.
 
 He also praised chief minister Conrad Sangma and sought the people's support to ensure that Clement Momin wins the election
 
 On the other hand, the Congress party, which has fielded Mukul Sangma's daughter Miani Shira is also campaigning hard to try and retain the Ampati constituency, which is considered to be a bastion for the Grand Old Party.
