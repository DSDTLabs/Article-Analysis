MUMBAI: The   ( ) is no longer the special planning authority for the Gorai-Manori, Uttan, Pali, Chowk, Tarodi, and Dongari areas. While   is within   limits, the others are in the jurisdiction of the Mira-Bhayandar municipal corporation. 

 The East Indian enclaves were identified as a tourism development zone (TDZ) and the MMRDA was appointed to prepare the development plan (DP) for the area, which it did. Last year, the plan was put up for objections and suggestions. Locals came out in large numbers opposing the plan. According to the draft, industrial development was to be allowed on land parcels of 10 hectares (25 acres) or above in areas classified as green zone I. Moreover, 15-metre-tall buildings (three to four floors) were to be allowed in such zones. The locals even set up an environment protection committee to oppose the plan.
 
 A notification issued by the state urban development department states that the MMRDA completed its task of preparing the DP for the notified area and the plan stood sanctioned by the government. But the MMRDA's plan is to be revalidated by the two civic corporations, though, as per the notification, any changes in development permissions are to be carried out in consultation with the MMRDA.
 
 Advocate Godfrey Pimenta, convenor,  , who helped locals file objections and represented them at hearings before the MMRDA, said, "At least residents do not have to come all the way to   to make any changes in the plan. It can be dealt with locally now."
