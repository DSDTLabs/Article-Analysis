AGRA: In a major overhaul of the   police department, those personnel who were found to have connections with "known criminal elements" would be transferred or demoted, said director general of police (DGP)  . The government has already created a list of such policemen and action will be started against them by the middle of April, he said on Sunday. 

 "Those policemen who are associated with criminal elements, or who are known to have shown such people undue favours over the years have been identified and will now be transferred or demoted. This is being done to make the department perform at optimum efficiency," DGP Ahmad said.
 
 The announcement was made right before the state government is expected to demote underperforming officers and promote and appoint nearly 200 IAS and IPS officers in the state.
 
 DGP Ahmad was in Agra for two days and held a meeting with the inspector general, deputy inspector general and senior superintendent of police to discuss the law and order situation of the area. In less than a week, four policemen were attacked in Agra zone itself out of which two were murdered in Agra and  . One more constable was shot dead in Pratapgarh.
