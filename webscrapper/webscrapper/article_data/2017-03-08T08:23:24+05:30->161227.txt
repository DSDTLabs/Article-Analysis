NOIDA: Noida can hope for a summer of fewer power cuts, thanks to a slew of measures taken by the power department. In view of the rising demand for electricity, 79 transformers of 400kV capacity are currently being installed at various villages across Noida.

 Over 92 transformers of 400kV capacity from the   will be added by the end of March to share the load. Old sectors such as 11, 12, 22, 26 and 27 will be given priority for transformer installation. Apart from this, maintenance work is currently under way on 80 substations.
 
 According to Mukul Singhal, superintending engineer, PVVNL, unlike last year’s peak demand (in the months of June, July and August) of 1,100MW, this year, the demand is expected to go up by 5-6%.
 
 For this, apart from upgrading existing substations, additional 79 transformers of 400kV capacity are currently being installed in the villages of Noida such as Barola (sectors 50, 78), Harola (Sector 2), Chaura (Sector 22), Nithari (Sector 31), among others. “These transformers are expected to bring big relief in sharing peak load demand,” Singhal told TOI.
 
 Further, the power department is carrying out extensive repair and maintenance work across its 80 substations in the city. “From oiling of transformers to checking on leakages, repair/replacement of parts as well as check on rusting panel boxes, cables is under way. This work is expected to be completed by March end,” Singhal said.
