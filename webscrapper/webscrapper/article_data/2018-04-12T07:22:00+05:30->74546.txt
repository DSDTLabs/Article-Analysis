Rohtak: The strike by interns at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, ended on Wednesday following an assurance by the authorities to accept their demands and form a vigilance committee. The PGIMS interns had been on strike for the past nine days, demanding fulfillment of their demands, including increase in stipend.

 PGIMS diorector Dr O P Kalra said the demands of protesting doctors had been accepted and a three-member committee formed to work in that direction. 
 
 PGIMS had to cancel its convocation scheduled on April 22 due to strike by MBBS and BDS interns and is yet to fix a new date for it.
