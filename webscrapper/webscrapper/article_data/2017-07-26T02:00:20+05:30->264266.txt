ISLAMABAD: Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Tuesday approved the request of  , the country’s high commissioner to India, for premature retirement from service.   was set to retire in April 2018.

 He had sent his resignation letter to Sharif, who, according to foreign office sources, has accepted it. Basit has already completed his three-year tenure in New Delhi and Sohail Mahmood, who is currently Pakistan’s ambassador to Turkey, is expected to take charge next month as the new high commissioner to India.
 
 According to media reports, Basit was unhappy with the government for giving preference to junior officers by appointing them in key positions. “Basit sought early retirement as he was not happy with the appointment of   as Pakistan’s foreign secretary,” local media reported, citing sources.
 
 Basit was among the top contenders for the foreign secretary slot when ex-foreign secretary Aizaz Chaudhry was appointed the country’s ambassador in Washington. A career diplomat, Sohail Mahmood, 55, joined Pakistan foreign service in 1985. He has not played any direct role in Pakistan’s India policy so far and is expected to land in New Delhi without any baggage.
 
 Mahmood will take charge at a time when there is no official dialogue between the two countries. The Pakistan military court’s decision to award death sentence to Indian national Khulbhushan Jadhav on charges of espionage has further deteriorated the situation.
