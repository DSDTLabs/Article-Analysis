NEW DELHI: Hurt by the  's caustic comments on his judgement convicting the Talwar couple in the Aarushi-Hemraj murder case, the trial judge (now retired) has moved the   seeking expunging of the HC's remark accusing him of being unaware of "basic tenets of law". 

 Former special   alleged that the high court while setting aside his verdict and acquitting the Talwars made "disparaging remarks" and "unwarranted comments" and sought their expunction. He said,"It is necessary that judicial decorum is maintained at all times and even where criticism is justified it must be in language of utmost restraint, keeping always in view that the person making the comment is also fallible." 
 
 Agreeing to hear his plea, a bench of justices Ranjan Gogoi and R Banumathi issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government, CBI and the Allahabad High Court and sought their response in four weeks.
 
 Senior advocate S R Singh, appearing for the retired judge, said the strictures passed against him would affect the judiciary at large and even when there was jurisdiction for criticism, the language should be dignified and restrained.
 
 In his petition, the former judge said he was not aggrieved against the judgement of the acquittal of Talwars but he was hurt by the observations. The high court in October acquitted the Talwar couple in the murder of their teenage daughter Aarushi and domestic help Hemraj. 
 
 The verdict ended a nine-year ordeal of the parents who were found guilty by a CBI court of murdering their 14-year-old daughter.
