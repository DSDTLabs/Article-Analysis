Pune: Over a month after techie Antara   was brutally murdered, her father Debananda Das, is set to come to Pune to meet senior police officers.

 Das told TOI over the phone on Monday that the murder of another techie in Pune on Sunday had shocked him. He said he wants the Pune rural police to solve his daughter’s murder.
 
 “There has been another murder in Pune involving another working woman. It is shocking and I can imagine what her family must be going through. It is good that police have been successful in arresting the man involved in her killing. The case related to my daughter has no answers as yet. Our efforts have gone in vain,” he said.
 
 “I have been trying to keep a tab on the happenings. I know the Pune rural police have a new superintendent. I plan to come down to Pune in February to meet him. I will request him to look into the case and solve it so that we have answers. The Pune rural police are doing their job but they have not been able to get anything out of Santosh,” he said. The Das family have told police that Santosh Kumar Gupta had been stalking her. 
 
 Antara, a software engineer with   in Pune, was brutally murdered on December 23 when she was walking down a dark pavement a few meters from her office gate in Talawade IT park. 
 
 The police had zeroed in on Gupta, who lives in Bengaluru, and knew Antara since long. Though the police have claimed that Gupta was the main conspirator, they have not been able to gather enough evidences against him so far.
 
 “I have been called by Antara’s office in connection with some formalities. That area in Pune seems to be an unsafe place for women. I am sure police must have some plan as many people, including women, work there in different companies,” Das said.
