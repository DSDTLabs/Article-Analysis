The album opens with 'Uff Yeh Noor', which gives a sneak-peek into Noor’s life. While Armaan Malik’s voice adds freshness to the track, the lively background score and the claps in between complement the peppy song. Second on the list is 'Gulabi 2.0', a tweaked version of the 70s chartbuster ' ' with additional lyrics by Kumaar. Amaal, Tulsi Kumar and Yash Narvekar’s sultry rendition gives this EDM number a party flavour. This is just another reprised version of the Mohammad Rafi classic, and is nothing to write home about. 
 
 Another club number in the album is 'Move Your Lakk', composed and written by Badshah. Sonakshi and Diljit Dosanjh join the rapper, and the three groove to this power-packed promotional track with swag. 'Jise Kehte Pyaar Hai' is a refreshing love song, in which Noor realises that she has finally fallen in love. Sukriti Kakar’s melodious voice (she’s the same girl who got us dancing to 'Kar Gayi Chull'), unpretentious lyrics and breezy music work well to elevate the mood of the song. Amaal’s simple composition, in which the voice takes precedence and the beats take a backseat, deserves a special mention. The phrase ‘What’s meant to be, will be’ is the underlying message in 'Hai Zaroori', sung by Prakriti Kakar. A slow, gloomy track, it has powerful lyrics by Manoj Muntashir, which will strike a chord with listeners. The music is well orchestrated, balancing the highs and lows from the percussion to the chimes.
