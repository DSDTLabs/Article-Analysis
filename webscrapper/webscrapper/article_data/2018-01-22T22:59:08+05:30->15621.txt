Surat: A group of parents of students of several schools met at a restaurant on Gaurav Path here and held discussions on the issue of fees on Monday. They expressed concern over quality of education if the schools were forced to bring down fees by the fees regulation committee (FRC) formed by the state government in different cities.  Parents of students of Delhi Public School, P P Savani, Abrama; S D Jain School, Vesu and a few others took part in the meeting. The group later addressed a press conference and said they were not against the state government’s decision, but worried about the quality of education to their children. Sources informed that a few parents were encouraged by some school administrators to hold a press conference and support the administrations of various schools which are charging more than the prescribed government fees.  “Many parents gathered to discuss the issue since they fear that the quality of education will deteriorate if deserving schools were forced to bring down their fees. We agree that if any school is found charging exorbitant fees for a student, then action should be taken against it. But this should not be generalized,” a parent said. “Parents are ready to pay higher fees to a school not only for education of their children, but for good extra-curricular activities as well. We knew the fees of the schools when we got our children admitted there. Therefore, the state government should take our opinion too while taking any decision on such a matter,” another parent said.
