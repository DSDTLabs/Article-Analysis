 From 10.30am the power supply to Carmona sub-station started fluctuating and this situation went on till 9pm. This sub-station caters to tourist hotspots like Cavelossim, Varca, Carmona and Orlim. 
 
 Inquiries with junior engineer Angle revealed that the in-coming supply at Xeldem was disrupted which resulted in the outage. Xeldem assistant engineer   said that there was a problem in  , and hence the incoming supply was stalled for two hours from 10.30am to 12.30pm. 
 
 He said that there were no issues after that. He also said that engineers at other sub-stations push the blame on them by saying in-coming supply from Xeldem is faulty. 
 
  superintending engineer   said that the situation should improve after the transformer at Cuncolim is replaced, which will be done in a couple of days.
