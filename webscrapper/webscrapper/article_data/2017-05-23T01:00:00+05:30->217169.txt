After 'Balika Vadhu',   will be back on TV in a negative role again. Roop, who will be seen playing the third angle in the love story of Raj and   in ' ', is not worried about being typecast. She says, “It’s better to play negative lead roles than portray just any other character on the show. On TV, you can either play the lead role or a vamp and the latter today has many shades.”

 The actress, who had hidden her marriage to  , a businessman, when she entered showbiz, reveals why she thought it was necessary. She says, “It is a myth that married women do not get work. Those days are gone now. So, if you think I hid my marriage for that reason, it’s not true. When you admit that you are married, people try to get skeletons out of your closet. They dig into your personal lives and link you with strangers, which could be detrimental. They also want to know details about your marriage, children and so on. I wanted to keep it private because I only want my work to speak.”
 
 Roop, who was only seen wearing a sari and salwar kameez on screen, surprised everyone when her bikini pictures emerged on social media. She says, “I had gone on a holiday to   and at a private beach I posed in a bikini. I don’t know if I would want to wear it on screen though.” But if the bikini was meant for private moments, why did she post a picture on her social media account? She replies, “Well, don’t I have a right to wear a bikini and show off? If actors can show their abs, why can’t women show their bikini bods?”
