Mumbai: The   vs   case has brought to the fore an interesting history of Cyrus Investments, one of the investment vehicles of the Mistry family and which owns shares of Tata Sons. The Mistrys had acquired Cyrus Investments, formerly named  , from lawyer-businessman   in the pre-independence era. This information was shared during the NCLT hearing in Mumbai on Monday.

 More than 90 years ago, Dinshaw had lent over Rs 2 crore to the   when its two major companies,   (now Tata Steel) and   (now Tata Power) ran into financial problems. When Tatas couldn’t repay the loan, the outstanding amount was converted into long term payments__that is one-eighth share in Tata Sons’ commissions. Dinshaw subsequently transferred the rights to the commissions to his private company, FE Dinshaw.
 
 In 1928, Dinshaw sold some shares of his company to Shapoorji Pallonji Mistry (Cyrus Mistry’s grandfather), thus beginning the Mistry family’s 90-year-old association with the Tatas. After more than two decades, in 1950s, the lawyer-businessman sold his majority stake in FE Dinshaw to the construction magnate. Later in 1978, FE Dinshaw, by then owned completely by the Mistrys, changed its name to Cyrus Investments as the earlier identity gave a misleading notion that the company was still owned by the then late Dinshaw and was associated with FE Dinshaw Estates, which is under the ownership of his family. In between, in 1965, the Mistrys had gained equity ownership in Tata Sons. Currently the Mistry family owns 18.4% in Tata Sons.tnn
