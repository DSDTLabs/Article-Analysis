CHENNAI: Adding a strong political tone to the pro-jallikattu street protests that   launched on Friday, party working president M K Stalin accused Prime Minister   of making time to meet actors and others but not AIADMK MPs who sought help to get the ban on the traditional bull sport lifted before the Pongal festivities began. He wanted the Centre to promulgate an Ordinance so that   could be held now. 

 Cadres poured on to the streets across the state joined by allies, including Congress, to pressure the Centre to facilitate holding the sport conducted during the harvest festival. Stalin, who participated in a protest outside the Chennai collectorate said AIADMK should continue to pressurise the Centre. Tamils will not forgive if the Centre and state did not take urgent steps to hold jallikattu this year, he said. 
 
 “Whom does Modi meet. He has met actors like Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, Rajinikanth and Gautami. I am not criticising them, for they have their own pride. But, for Modi who allots time for these actors, can’t he give time to AIADMK MPs to discuss an issue of heritage importance of Tamils,” said Stalin.
 
 Hitting out at the state government, Stalin said chief minister   should have left to New Delhi from Hyderabad on Thursday, after the Supreme Court declined to pass an order on jallikattu, and met Modi and discussed the issue, Stalin said. 
 
 “It is not a problem for the NDA government to promulgate an ordinance. So far the Centre has promulgated 22 ordinances, including a controversial Land Acquisition Act. It is still not too late, we have a day left for Pongal... I humbly and rightfully ask on behalf of Tamils, bring an ordinance, else the people will not forgive the Centre and the state government,” said Stalin. DMK leaders in other districts too staged protest meetings.
