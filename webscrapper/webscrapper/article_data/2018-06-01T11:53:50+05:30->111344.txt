HYDERABAD: Union law minister   on Thursday dismissed the attempt of various political parties to form an alliance against the   (BJP). "Darned clothes won't last long," he commented on the efforts being made by the opposition parties. "But we are happy. Earlier, the parties used to unite against the  , now it is against the  . It only shows our popularity," he said at a press conference in Hyderabad. The Union minister was talking about the show that was put up by several parties in Karnataka recently as they rallied against the BJP. 

 
 "But we are going to play a big role in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Both these states will be our focus areas," Ravi Shankar Prasad said. When pointed out by TOI that Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and   chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao were dismissive about the BJP, Prasad quipped: "Naidu should not disown his legacy of sailing with us for three-and-a-half years." He added that the opposition unity would serve no purpose as they won't be able to provide a stable government. "They cannot lead and have no acceptable leader," Prasad said. 
 
 Prasad said the outcome of bypolls, most of which have been against the BJP, should not be a barometer to read BJP's popularity. "During general elections, people will vote in favour of the BJP," he said.
 
 He also spoke about the rapid strides IT has made in the last four years comparing it with the previous Manmohan Singh-led UPA government. After demonetisation, Telangana was the first state to adopt digital transactions. "I would say it would have been better if there was digital transfer of money," he said, when asked about his opinion on the Telangana government distributing cheques to farmers under the Rythu Bandhu scheme.
