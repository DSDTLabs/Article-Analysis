ALAPPUZHA: Seventeen years ago on January 22, 2000, fate brought   before Chellamma Antharjanam-a destitute Brahmin widow-who was about to jump in front of a train at Ambalappuzha. Rasiya recused her, took her home and cared for her; then began their unusual friendship that surpassed religious and cultural differences. 

 That bond ended on Tuesday night when Chellamma passed away. But Rasiya ensured that the funeral was conducted in the way her friend wished: by following Hindu rituals on Wednesday noon.
 
 Reminiscing their time together, the former vice-president of   described how Chellamma became a destitute after her husband, who was mental ill, died five years after their marriage. "Chellamma was working as a maid. When she became old, she returned to her brother's home and was turned away. Alone, she made up her mind to end her life and met me instead," she said.
 
 Rasiya, who was living alone, constructed a house with a kitchen and two rooms under the panchayat scheme. The house named 'Chellamma Bhavanam' had a 'thulasithara' too.
 
 This unusual friendship inspired Malayalam producer-director   to make a film 'Thanichalla Njan', which bagged the national award for the best feature film on national integration. Actor Kalpana essayed Rasiya's role. Kalpana, who used to visit them, extended support till her unexpected death in 2016. Kalpana received national award for the best supporting actor for the same film.   was cast as Chellamma in the film.
 
 "She was admitted to the medical college after she fell down at home on June 5. She underwent a surgery some days ago and was discharged from the hospital on July 1. On July 8, the plaster was removed from her leg. We had appam and tea on Tuesday and then I lost her. I am unable to put in words my anguish. I don't know how I will live without her," said an inconsolable Rasiya.
