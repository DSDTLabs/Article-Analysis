VADODARA/ANAND: A leopard and a cub kept villagers of   on the banks of   near   of Anand on the edge throughout Friday. 

 It was late on Thursday evening that villagers of Anklavdi had spotted the leopard and the cub in a banana farm. Rama Solanki, a farmer of the village, had also received minor injuries after he was attacked by the big cat, when he was returning home by taking a shorter route from the banana farm. Number of locals had later thronged the farm located on the outskirts of the village while Anand district’s forest officials were informed about the animal’s presence in the area. Later, the forest department officials had also put up a cage but the leopard could not be caged. 
 
 “We have put a cage to trap the leopard and the cub since Thursday evening but the entire area is surrounded by ravines and there is also presence of nilgai (blue bull) in the area. We are continuing our efforts to trap the animal,” said J R Patel, in-charge range forest officer. He said that even after over 24 hours of efforts the animal has remained elusive.“It may have left the spot because of presence of large number of villagers in the area,” he said, adding that apart from forest department officials, volunteers of NGOs are also present at the spot. 
 
 Locals said that the forest department officials, who have brought the equipment, cannot do much as the leopard is moving from one place to another in a wide open space. 
 
 The residents will spend their night keeping guard as the last attempt to render the animal unconscious before nightfall on Friday too had failed.
