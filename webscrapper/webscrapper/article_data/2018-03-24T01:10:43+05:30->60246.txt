MUMBAI : A day after Maharashtra Navnirman Sena President Raj Thackeray’s sarcastic remarks against him, senior BJP leader and Union transport minister   asked him to refrain from making uncalled for and baseless remarks.

 Addressing the   rally on Gudipadwa at  , Thackeray had launched an attack on Gadkari, saying his announcements are like soap bubbles which vanish in a fraction of second. “Gadkari’s announcements are like soap bubbles. Gadkari himself knows that there is resource crunch and that announcements made by him will never see the light of the day, still he is making populist announcements,” Thackeray had said.
 
 Taking objections to Thackeray’s critical remarks, Gadkari sent a 25-page letter, listing key decisions taken by him after he took over the reins of the transport department and their present status. “I have taken several key decisions, particularly for Maharashtra. They are different stages of completion. It would have been better had you done some basic research before passing remarks. I am prepared for a public debate on the work done by my department at the same venue, Shivaji Park,” Gadkari said.
 
 Gadkari said when he took over the charge of the transport ministry, the length of national highways passing through Maharashtra was 5700 km, while now work has been sanctioned for 16,736 km, as a result, the length of national highways in Maharashtra has crossed 22,436 km.
 
 Gadkari pointed out that in view of sudden spurt in suicides, the state government has undertaken 78 irrigation projects in Vidarbha and 26 in Marathwada.
