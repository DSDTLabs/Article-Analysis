While themes like feminism,   and cross-dressing have been recurrent for fashion shows organized by different societies of DU colleges, the fashion society of Ramanujan College chose an offbeat theme – cross-border surgical strikes – for its fashion show at   on Thursday. 

 Glitz, the fashion society of Kamala Nehru College, organized its annual fashion show competition, La Vogue, on the last day of Ullas, its annual cultural festival. While other colleges presented Shiva-inspired and  , Glam, the fashion society of Ramanujan College, presented ‘Highlights of 2016’, which included surgical strikes,   and glimpses from the Rio Olympics held last year.

 Jamaluddin, a third-year student and a member of the society, dressed like a terrorist in a black kurta pyjama with his face covered, and a rifle in one hand, surprising many. After he went backstage, Prabneet and Himanshu, who were dressed as soldiers with guns, walked the ramp. 'Since the theme was ‘Highlights of 2016’, it was important to showcase the surgical strikes that took place last year, and we got a very good response from the students, who always get excited on seeing army officers," said  , vice-president of the society. 
 
 Jamaluddin said, "We are proud of this act as we were able to depict something as serious as the surgical strikes. I always thought it was important for me to dress up like a terrorist for this show to do justice to our theme."
