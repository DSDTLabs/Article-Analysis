MUMBAI: If you are visiting Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan and zoo in Byculla any time soon, you will now receive a barcoded ticket instead of the usual paper which you showed the guard at the entry gate. The new ticket has to be swiped at the main entrance and while entering the Humboldt penguin enclosure.

 The zoo authorities said the new ticket is being introduced as the entry fee hike comes into effect from August 1. Adults will have to pay Rs50 to enter the zoo. The fee all these years was only Rs5 for adults and Rs2 for children. Zoo director Dr Sanjay Tripathi said they felt the new tickets will prove to be a more secure. “It will help us know the exact number of visitors to the zoo and revenue, as no one will be able to enter without this ticket,” said Tripathi. 
 
 The fee hike was proposed after BMC kept the   for public viewing. The new rates were criticised by activists in the city, who felt it would restrict the entry of many who could not afford an entry fee of Rs50. But the zoo authorities said it would not affect the number of visitors.
 
 On July 26 last year, three male and five female penguins were brought to the zoo from Coex Aquarium, Seoul, in South Korea. They had been kept in a quarantine facility, where the temperature was maintained at 16-18 degrees Celsius, only to be moved to a swanky enclosure this March. Olive, Molt, Bubble, Donald, Daisy, Popeye and Flipper, the flightless birds, were also kept for public viewing from that month. Dory, one of the penguins, died last October. The zoo has earned around Rs 48 lakh, with one million visitors, since then.
