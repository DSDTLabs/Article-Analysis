MUMBAI: The Makar Sankranti festival on Saturday proved to be dangerous for birds, with nearly 65 getting admitted to the   in Parel in a span of 48 hours with  , said the hospital’s doctors on Saturday evening.

 Sankranti is marked by flying kites, but the   used for the kites is so sharp that it ends up injuring people, birds and animals. “Birds suffer the most. Apart from the 65 brought to the hospital, another 70 birds were treated by our two mobile ambulances moving in south Mumbai and the suburbs on Saturday,’’ said Lt Col Dr J C Khanna of the Bombay Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BSPCA). 
 
 Almost 75% of the   birds were pigeons, with seven kites, five owls and one seagull also in the list. Two birds died as a result. “Most of the birds have cut wings that won’t heal. They will be kept for life in our hospital,’’ said a senior doctor. 
 
 The manja is an abrasive thread used for kite-fighting. Fine particles of glass is used to polish the thread and make it sharp to cut other thread. Birds are common victims during the festival when people indulge in kite fights.
