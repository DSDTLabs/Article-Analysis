Pune: Spraying itching powder on clothes of a 31-year-old Hadapsar resident, two men on Wednesday morning decamped with his bag containing Rs3.90 lakh on B T Kawde Road.

 The victim, Mahadev Daund, of Kale Padal in Hadapsar was returning home with his friend around 11.30am when the incident occurred.
 
 Daund is preparing for the Maharashtra Public Service Commission examination. His friend, Baliram Dole, had recently sold his land in Kalepadal. The man purchasing the land had deposited its price in the bank account of Daund’s relative.
 
 “On Wednesday morning, Dole had gone to the bank in Hadapsar to withdraw the cash. But he was told to come after an hour,” said senior inspector Anil Patrudkar of Kondhwa police.
 
 Patrudkar said Dole then contacted Daund and told him to come near the bank with a bag. Daund reached there 11.30am and put the cash in the bag.
 
 “Daund said he had an itching sensation while coming out of the bank, but he ignored it and started heading towards B T Kawde Road with Dole on the latter’s motorcycle,” he said.
 
 Dole stopped the bike on the way and went into a shop for some work, while Daund stood near the motorcycle with the bag. “An unidentified person approached Daund and told him that there was some dirt on his shirt. As Daund was feeling itchy, he removed his T-shirt. As he was checking it, two men on a bike fled with the bag,” he said.
 
 A similar incident was reported at Chandni Chowk in Bhosari on Tuesday, when unidentified men sprayed powder on Tukaram Salvi and fled with a bag containing Rs1.23 lakh.
