AHMEDABAD: Seventeen   in   on   were gutted in a   on Sunday afternoon. While the Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) officials are yet to ascertain the reason for the fire, they believe that the naked flame used for cooking might have started it.

 AFES officials received a call at 1.50 pm from Ganeshnagar after which seven vehicles and a team of 22 officers and personnel were sent to the spot. Firefighting lasted for nearly two hours. Fortunately nobody was reported hurt; the area had been cleared after the first hut caught fire, said AFES officials. 
 
 In another incident reported at the same time, Shapath V on SG Road reported smoke up to the 7th floor. AFES officials said the reason was burning of waste in the basement of the building. “The smoke travelled up which created confusion about the source of fire,” said an official. “The officials at the building have been asked to be more careful about waste disposal.”
 
 On Saturday night, AFES recorded a major case when an LPG cylinder exploded even as a firefighting operation was on. Three firemen escaped with minor injuries. The incident took place on the third floor of Vraj Apartment near Lal Bungalow on CG Road where the occupants had complained of fire that had started from a refrigerator.
 
 “The cylinder might have been leaking. The cylinder did not have much gas otherwise it could have been a disaster,” said an AFES official.
