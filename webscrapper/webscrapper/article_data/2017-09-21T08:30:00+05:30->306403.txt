Mohali: Police cracked the case of attempted murder of an advocate with the arrest of two persons, who confessed to be contract killers, on Wednesday. The accused have been identified as Varinder Singh, a resident of Dholewal village in Sangrur and Jasprit Singh alias Bamba, a resident of Daad village in Ludhiana. 

 During preliminary interrogation, police said the accused confessed that a relative of the advocate hired them as contract killers. SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal said, “We have arrested the two in connection with the attempted murder of advocate Harkishan Singh. We recovered a .32 bore pistol, 30 caliber rifle, ammunition, laptop, mobile phone and Rs 25,500 from their possession. They confessed that they were hired by an NRI relative of Harkishen to murder him.” The car in which they attacked the victim has also been recovered. 
 
 Police said Gurpreet Singh, the NRI relative of the victim from Canada came to Mohali three to four months before the incident and hired the contract killers. Since then, the accused had been following Harkishen and on May 26, they shot at him while he was heading towards the court complex near Radha Soami Satsand Beas building. The advocate escaped as the killers missed and hit his scooter. 
 
 Police said Gurpreet hatched the plot suspecting the advocate of acting as counsel for his wife, who divorced him. His wife is the younger sister of Harkishen’s wife. After the divorce, custody of the NRI’s two children was also given to the ex-wife. Police booked NRI Gurpreet Singh under section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for criminal conspiracy to eliminate the advocate.
