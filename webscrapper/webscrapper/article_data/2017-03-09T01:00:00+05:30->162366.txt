We had multiple musicians bringing out singles on Valentine’s Day. And now, a couple of them have come up with songs for Women’s Day, too. One such composer is R  , who is known for bringing out special songs, especially during Women’s Day. For the third consecutive year, the composer has come up with a song titled, Enadhu Iniya, which is rendered by singer MM   an written by Dharan. 

 Talking about the song,   says, “This song brings out the various emotions of women, including calling all men as a ‘friend’ and asking them to hear out what women have to say. The song speaks against male chauvinism and speaks about giving freedom of choice to women — in terms of clothing, thoughts and lifestyle. It is more of women hitting back at the society and rising up against all odds.”
 
 On choosing Manasi, he says, “The song is based on the ragam, darbari. Since it has a Carnatic base, I wanted someone who can sing the tune confidently. Manasi has that classical backgorund.” 
 
 Kumar ensures he composes a song for every special day. “It is a passion of mine. Also, you can convey things to people beautifully through music and lyrics,” he adds.
