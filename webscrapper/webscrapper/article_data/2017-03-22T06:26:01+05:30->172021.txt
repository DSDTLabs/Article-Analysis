NEW DELHI: The national   regulator and   (GIC) will come out with a policy that will make it mandatory for everyone buying a new vehicle to pay third-party insurance premium for three and five years for cars and two wheelers, respectively , at the time of registration.

 They will also design and market separate policies for third-party, owndamage and comprehensive vehicle insurance.This will allow vehicle owners to choose any of the products over and above the third-party insurance, which is mandatory .
 
 It will also help states compel owners to have   for their vehicles.
 
 Third-party insurance premium is only around one-third of the total premium one pays for composite insurance cover.   (IRDA) and GIC assured these steps to a Supreme Court committee on road safety after the panel made these recommendations.
 
 These moves gain importance in view of the fact that over 45% of the vehicles plying on Indian roads are uninsured and victims of road crashes involving such vehicles run the risk of getting no compensation. This is far more critical as more than 60% of two-wheelers have no insurance cover and these vehicles are responsible for every fourth road death in India. GIC has told the SC panel that till December end, about eight crore of the total 14 crore vehicles plying on roads had insurance cover. It has also urged the panel to instruct state governments to carry out checks and identification of uninsured vehicles on a quarterly basis.
 
 Earlier this month, a parliamentary standing committee had recommended to the government to consider a framework to make third-party insurance a one-time affair, as is the case with the vehicle registration tax. It had suggested that everyone buying a new vehicle should be made to pay the amount at the time of registration.
