It was RGV’s birthday yesterday and friends and well-wishers were flooding the filmmaker with ‘Happy Birthday’ wishes. But it seemed to have touched a raw nerve.   shared his lament, posting, “To all those who are wishing me to have a great birthday I am having a miserable one because I am now one year older (sic)”. But then, soon, the filmmaker found a reason to cheer, courtesy a hater who made him this special birthday poster (see inset). The filmmaker seems to have loved the moniker: “Devil of tweets and the terrorist of films”, that was plastered on a photo of Ramu riding what seemed like the Twitter bird with a phone in one hand and an empty bottle of vodka in the other. “A hater of mine did this and I love him for it (sic),” he posted, with heart-eyed emojis. Well, looks like the term ‘love-hate relationship’ just found a whole new meaning.
