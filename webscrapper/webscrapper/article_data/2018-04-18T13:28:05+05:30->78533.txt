JAIPUR: Ajmer in Rajasthan stands second in the country among cities with most   addicted children after Goa but there is no de-addiction centre there. The addicted children have no place to go for treatment; the Rajasthan high court was informed.

 The division bench of Justice M N   and D C Somani was hearing a suo motu petition drug addiction among children in the dargah area of Ajmer.
 
 An Ajmer   report field in the court said that Goa stands first in the number of drug addicted children followed by Ajmer and the third place goes to Kullu in Himachal Pradesh. The surprising fact is that there is no de-addiction centre in Ajmer and the police have left with no other option except to let off the children addicted to drugs. These children indulge in criminal activities.
 
 The report said the drug menace is rampant in the dargah area and   in the district.
 
 The court said there is need for deaddiction centres and serious action to be taken against the drug peddlers to address the issue.
 
 The court observed that despite the menace of drug addiction rampant in the area there is no effort to address the issue by setting up deaddiction centres and coming down heavily on the drug peddlers.
 
 The court has directed the state police to clamp down on drug peddlers who were mainly operating in Pushkar and Ajmerâ€™s dargah area. The court directed the district SP to be present in the court on next hearing on April 30.
