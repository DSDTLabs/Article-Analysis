HYDERABAD: With meagre returns of 158,   was one of the three successful Bangladesh bowlers here on Thursday. The seamer started the day well, scalping   in the first over of the day, but the visitors toiled the next 50 overs for their second wicket.

 “It was a new experience for me because I am playing the third Test of my career and my first Test in India. I've noticed that India score big against every team. The ball did a bit in the first hour, but after that it was dry and flat,“ Taskin said.
 
 “On these kind of wickets, bowlers have to be patient. You can't bowl loose deliveries, but be patient and wait for the batsman to make a mistake. I tried to reverse swing, but they are the No.1 team and they handled it well.“ The 21-year-old from Dhaka said he is learning from West Indies legend Courtney Walsh, who is with the Bangladesh team as their bowling coach. “He is helping us and we're learning a lot of things from him. The main thing is all the fast bowlers in our team are very inexperienced and we are learning day by day . I'm sure it will help us in future.“
 
 Taskin rued the missed opportunity to run-out   . “If that run out had happened, we probably would have had 5-6 wickets instead of three. But that's part of the game, we are hoping to start well tomorrow.“
 
 The Bangladesh bowlers, he said, will have to be more consistent if they want to contain  . “He is the top batsman in the world. He left the good balls, edged a few but loose balls were all hit for boundaries. Our bowlers will need to be more consistent.“
