GURUGRAM: The   ( ) has almost finalised the blueprint for a cashless and paperless ticketing system for its  .

  On Thursday, CEO V Umashankar held a meeting with the heads of various banks, including telecom banks (like Jio Money or  ) in Mumbai, to finalise the funding model of a card- and mobile-based payment system.
 
 “We have had a series of meetings with the banks, and received their quotes. While we’ll absorb part of the cost, the rest will be borne by the bank. We want to make the bid competitive. Apart from card-based solutions, we’ll also offer mobile-based solutions, for which we’re in talks with telecom banks as well. The idea is to have a cashless and paperless ticketing system for the city bus service. We’d need around three months to roll this out, and one month to market it,” said Umashankar.
 
 GMDA plans to bring out a common card, which can be used to buy groceries and pay utility bills apart from travelling in buses and metro. 
 
 The city bus service is supposed to roll out by August 15. While the technical bid is over, financial bids will be opened on Friday. “Four bidders had participated in the technical bid and all four have qualified to the next round, which is for the financial bid, which will be opened on Friday. We’re hopeful of meeting the mid-August deadline to roll out the buses. We’ll also do the branding of these buses by then,” he said.
 
 The city bus project has been in the pipeline for over a decade. It received a final push after GMDA was formed last year. Initially, buses were to be rolled out by end-March, but in the last GMDA meeting, chief minister M L Khattar announced the deadline has been extended to August 15, by when 200 buses will be rolled out. The remaining 300 buses are expected to hit the roads only by the end of this year or in early 2019.
