BENGALURU:  , the new Karnataka DG&IGP, is a man a hurry. He has less than a year before he retires, and within that time he aims to improve   and turn the police into a   that files   instead of waiting for complaints. Excerpts from an interview to TOI.

 
 
 
 Yes, it can be a handicap because you have been out of touch. But it is also an advantage as I come with a clean record. I'm no one's favourite or foe. I have spent several years in Karnataka in various posts and with my experience in CBI, I can perform.
 
 
 
 
 Even the smallest thing that happens in Bengaluru is a talking point on international platfor ms. There were some incidents reported during New Year's Eve and it was all over the news. I want Bengaluru police to take proactive steps for women's safety.
 
 Any steps in particular to make the city safer?
 
 It is important to change the attitude in police stations.Police have to proactively engage when it comes to women's safety. They should take a phone call for help as a serious complaint. 80% of the police comprises non-executive posts. They should be given more respect and responsibility , and there should be higher accountability . The beat system needs to change.There shouldn't be rotation of constables, so that one constable is able to become familiar with the area.
 
 
 
 
 Yes, it was only after the stint that I faced complaints, including a court case. But the judiciary has given me a clean chit. Some of the cases were filed by those affected. I am happy. The stint created fear in corrupt officers.
 
 
 
 I wish to do away with many jobs, which had meaning 30 years ago, but are irrelevant now so that manpower can be diverted to relevant work. This needs proper permission from the government.I don't understand why cases should go to CBI or CID. We should bring back people's trust in police's investigation skills.
