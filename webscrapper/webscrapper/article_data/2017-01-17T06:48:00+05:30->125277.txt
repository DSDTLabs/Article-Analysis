MUKTSAR: Punjab CM   on Monday reacted sharply to the candidature of three big guns of Congress, including newly-inducted Amritsar ex-MP  , saying they “would not know even the names of villages of the seats they are fighting from“.

 “In 7-10 days, one can't even remember the names of villages. These candidadates don't know the number of booths or villages. Some are from Patiala and some from Delhi (referring to Captain Amarinder and  ). People know they won't be available after election,“ said Badal senior “And Bittu and Sidhu are not some Aurangzeb,“ he added.
 
 Earlier, Union minister and deputy CM  's wife   took swipes at Sidhu for returning to a party “responsible for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots“.
 
 “Congratulations to Sidhu saab who calls it ghar wapasi to go to a party that wreaked genocide on the Sikh community . Some people have their feet in three boats, sometimes BJP, Congress and why not go ahead a little into Pakistan,“ she said.
