Vadodara: A 10-year-old girl, who was   by her father, was rescued by the 181   near  . 

 The girl’s family sells books in the area to earn a living. But her father got angry after she failed to sell a single book and branded her on face and hands. 
 
 The helpline officials said that the girl’s father works as labourer. As his income was not enough, he managed a small amount and bought some books. He asked his daughter to roam around railway station area and sell the books.
