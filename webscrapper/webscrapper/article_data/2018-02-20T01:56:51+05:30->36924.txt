NAVI MUMBAI: A week after a woman from   was crushed to death with a grinding stone at her flat in Vashi, her husband, who was absconding, was arrested on Saturday. The police claimed that   (42), a real estate agent, suspected his wife,   (37), of having an extra-marital affair. 

 Ganesh allegedly smashed Snehal's head with a grinding stone and had jabbed her face with a pair of scissors on February 11. The police claimed that Ganesh has confessed to the crime. 
 
 "The accused did not have a regular income due to the uncertainty in the real estate business and had taken to the bottle. Snehal kept the home fires burning by tutoring students in Sanskrit at her home," said police inspector (crime) Kisan  . "Over the past three years, there were frequent quarrels between the couple as Ganesh suspected her of infidelity, especially whenever she spoke to any man."
 
 Gaikwad said that Snehal had moved to her brother's house in Kamothe along with their son as she was unable to bear the humiliation.
 
 After killing Snehal, he fled to Surat and moved to Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri to evade arrest. "Eventually, he returned to Vashi, and the cops got wind of it. He was arrested from Kopri village," said another police officer.
 
 On February 11, Snehal had gone to her husband's house in Vashi to collect her and her son's clothes when Ganesh picked up yet another quarrel with her and beat her up. When she retaliated, he hit her with a grinding stone and stabbed her face with a pair of scissors. Ganesh then locked the house and escaped.
 
 As Snehal did not return nor answered her brother's calls, he asked his other sister to check on her. When she reached the house, she found the door locked and alerted her neighbours. One of them climbed a scaffolding and found Snehal lying in a pool of blood.
