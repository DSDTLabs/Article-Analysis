SHIMLA: Union health minister J P Nadda launched the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) under Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) from Mandi on Saturday.   to substantially reduce the   disease by   from its severe forms such as pneumonia and meningitis. 

 Pneumococcal disease is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in children under five years of age across the globe and in India, out of which the latter constitutes 20% alone. Terming this as an exemplary step in India’s immunization programme, Nadda said the Centre is committed to reduce morbidity and mortality among children. He added that no children should die from vaccine preventable diseases in the country. 
 
 “While these vaccines in the private sector were accessible to only those who could afford them, by making them available under the UIP, the government is ensuring equitable access to those who need them the most, especially the underprivileged and underserved,” he said.
 
 Under mission Indradhanush, launched on 25 December 2014, which aimed at expanding immunization coverage to all children of the country by 2020, more than 2.6 crore beneficiaries have been immunized. Currently, the vaccine is being rolled out to approximately 21 lakh children in   and parts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. This will be followed by its circulation in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan next year. From 1 per cent annual increase in coverage of full immunisation.
