NEW DELHI: Anxiety clouding their faces, members of the   of Nizamuddin have been “running from pillar to post to get some information”, as one of them put it. Their concern is about the disappearance of Syed Asif Ali Nizami, the Sajda Nashin or hereditary administrator of the  , and his nephew Nazim Nizami since March 15 while on a trip to Pakistan.

 The octogenarian Asif Nizami was visiting Pakistan after three decades to call on his 90-year-old sister in Karachi. The uncle-nephew due was last seen on March 14 at the shrines of Baba Farid Ganjshakar in Pak Pattan, around 180 km from Lahore, and the Data Durbar or Data Ganj Baksh.
 
 “Nazim has been a frequent visitor to the shrines in Pakistan because of a traditional link between the Nizamuddin Dargah and both the Data Darbar and the Pak Pattan shrines,” said Syed Sajid Ali Nizami, son of Asif Nizami on Friday. “They sent us pictures on Whatsapp that they took at the two shrines. The following day they were scheduled to take the flight for Karachi to visit my aunt. But Nazim bhai was stopped at Lahore’s Allama Iqbal Airport.”
 
 Relatives waiting for the duo at Jinnah Airport in Karachi never saw either of the men coming out of the airport. “After landing in Karachi, our father had phoned to inform us about what happened at Lahore airport. Neither we in India nor relatives in Pakistan have heard from him since,” claimed Sajid.
 
 Altamash Nizami, another relative, said that the family was fretful and anxious about the wellbeing of the two men and hoped that “whoever was holding them should release them soon”. The family plans to seek an appointment with union home minister Rajnath Singh.
 
 Meanwhile, Nafees Zakaria, spokesperson of the  , acknowledged receiving a query about the   men from the Indian government on Friday.
