PANAJI: If a female MP laughs in Parliament, it is being seen as unwanted behaviour. A layman can harbour such perceptions, but this is not expected of law-makers sitting in the Parliament, Congress MP   said in Goa on Sunday. She was reacting to PM Narendra Modi’s ‘Ramayana’ jibe at   earlier this month in the  . 

 “Earlier, the land laws favoured men. The laws were later changed, but the perception they created about women remained. Even if a woman laughs in Parliament today it is seen as being unbecoming of her. Some men have this perception of women, but men who make laws in parliament cannot have such perceptions. They are expected to give the country direction with their status. But if they continue to behave in this manner, how many years will it take us to give the girl child and females the equality they deserve,” said Chowdhury at the international conference on gender inequality ‘Difficult Dialogues’ in Goa.
 
  Chowdhury later said she didn’t require permission to laugh ‘after being a five-time MP’.
