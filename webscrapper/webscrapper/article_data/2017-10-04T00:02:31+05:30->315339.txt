MUMBAI: A   of   has told the cops that when she asked one of the accused, prison guard Bindu Naikude why she and the others had severely assaulted the victim, the cop laughed and replied,“Whoever commits mistakes like her will be assaulted in a similar manner.” 

 The statement of the witness, a jail inmate, is one among the 182 cited in the 990-page chargesheet made available to the defence. The witness had questioned Naikude on the evening of June 23, the day Shetye was allegedly assaulted. Shetye died the following day. 
 
 The document was submitted before the magistrate court last week against jailor Manisha Pokharkar and guards Bindu Naikude, Waseema Shaikh, Sheetal Shegaokar, Surekha Gudve and Aarti Shingane. The brief facts of the document said that the murder was premeditated as the officers had allegedly received complaints about Shetye from inmates. 
 
 Among the witnesses are five foreign national inmates whose statements are recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code. One of them, Julie Warner said that after she saw the accused were assaulting Manjula with a stick, kicks and slaps, she shouted “enough, enough stop”. Cremancia Basikoro, a Zimbabwe national, told the cops that she saw the accused beating Shetye in her barrack and the victim was begging for them to stop. Tanzanian inmate Fatima Chambo recalled that on the evening of the incident she saw that Shetye was not in a position to walk and Porkharkar even ignored her plight. 
 
 Inmate Fazleen Shaikh has told cops that she too was brutally assaulted in April when she brought to jail kheema pav provided by her family during a court hearing. She said that she was repeatedly beaten up by officials including Pokharkar, Naikude, Shaikh, Shingane among others. Fazleen said that ever since Pokharkar began her stint in January, inmates and warders felt terrorized.
