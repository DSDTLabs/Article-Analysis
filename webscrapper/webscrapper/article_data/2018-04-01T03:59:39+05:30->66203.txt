GREAT NOIDA: Play truant but don’t get caught — even if it is a drill.

 A   attached to   police station has been sent to the   for misleading the senior superintendent of police about the location of the station house officer during a security drill on Friday night. A probe, too, has been ordered into the matter.
 
 As part of the drill, Noida SSP Ajay Pal Sharma had sent a wireless message to all SHOs in   to share with him their location and assignments. The accused constable, Devendra Pawar, responded to the message, saying the   of his police station, BK Verma, had gone out to conduct a raid.
 
 Sharma then asked all SHOs to share their location and pictures on WhatsApp. The Noida police chief said while all other officers responded with WhatsApp messages, the SHO of Kasna police station did not.
 
 When Sharma visited the Kasna police station to see what was wrong, he apparently found SHO Verma sleeping in a room.
 
 Sources said the constable, Pawar, had admitted to giving false information about the SHO’s location. He was then sent to the police lines. 
 
 “We have also ordered a probe into the matter,” the SSP said.
 
 Verma said he was unwell on Friday and was there at the Kasna police when the wireless message was flashed. “The constable inadvertently said that that I was on a round in the area,” he said.
