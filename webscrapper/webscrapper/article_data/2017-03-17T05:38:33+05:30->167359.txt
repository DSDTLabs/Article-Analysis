LUCKNOW:   (II) on Thursday granted bail to Chennai-based Dr M Sudheer who was arrested by   on February 24. Special Judge Harish Tripathi ordered his release on furnishing two sureties of Rs 50,000 each and a personal bond of the same amount.

 The bail comes after Lucknow police admitted lapses in the initial investigations. Dr Sudheer, a professor of orthopaedics at the Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, was arrested on the basis of an FIR against him at   police station in June last year by one Sarfaraz, a city-based real estate agent. In the FIR, the doctor was accused of not paying back Rs 1 crore taken for opening a medical college in UP. Tamil Nadu government doctors went on strike after his arrest. Meanwhile, a money lender, Kamraj, who was also arrested by the   police, admitted he framed   with the help of his aides in UP. 
 
 Lapses in the police investigation came to the fore when SSP Lucknow Mazil Saini re-examined the case on the directions of DIG, Lucknow range. On Thursday, Saini replaced the investigating officer of the case and deputed Indiranagar police station inspector Dhirendra Kushwaha who will work under the supervision of ASP (Aliganj) Meenakshi Gupta.
 
 ASP (trans-Gomti) Durgesh Kumar, who has assigned the task of probing the role of officials responsible for the lapses said, “We will verify the documents put forward by both Dr Sudheer and Sarfaraz.”
