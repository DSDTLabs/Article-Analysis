NAVI MUMBAI: Close to 1000 motorcyclists were stopped and issued a warning by the   along the Mumbai-Goa highway, between Wadkhal and Pen, for not wearing the mandatory safety helmets on Saturday.

 This is one of the biggest road safety drives conducted by the traffic cops along the busy highways, to warn and also inform the   that the penalty for not wearing helmets has now been upgraded from Rs 100 to Rs 500 as per the state government rules.
 
 Talking to TOI, Police Inspector (traffic) of  , Manojkumar Mhatre, said: "Today we did not issue challans or collect any fines, as we wanted to suitably make the motorists aware that they cannot drive without wearing helmets. Since the penalty is now a stiff Rs 500 per head for helmetless driving, the citizens have been formally told that next time they should only venture out on their bikes with proper helmets."
 
 PI Mhatre added that while this drive was done on the Pen-Wakhal stretch of the highway, they will also carry out similar drives in other interior roads and places like Alibaug, Roha, Mahad, Shrivardhan among others. "It is also often seen that bikers go 'triple seat' on a single motorcycle. This dangerous practice also needs to be stopped in order to curtail the number of road fatalities," said Mhatre.
