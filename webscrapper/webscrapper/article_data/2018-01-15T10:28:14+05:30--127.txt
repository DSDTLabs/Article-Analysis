VIJAYAWADA:Temples across the state witnessed a huge rush of devotees on Sunday on the eve of   celebrations. A large number of people were seen waiting in queue lines for ‘darshan’ of Goddess   at Sri   atop the Indrakeeladri since early on Sunday.

 Vedic scholars offered special prayers and performed rituals as a part of the Bhogi celebrations. Temple priests performed special pujas for ‘bhogi mantalu; and prayed for the prosperity of farmers across the country as Sankranti is the festival of farmers. “Sun will enter ‘uttarayana’ from ‘dakshinayanam’ on the day of Sankranti and it has a great significance. The special bonfire was arranged at the temple and the ‘gangireddu vinyasalu’ programme was organised reflecting tradition,” said Shiva Prasada Sharma, vedic scholar at Durga temple.
 
 ‘Bommala koluvu’ arranged at   on the   Durga temple premises is drawing huge response from children. Traditional   and Etikoppaka toys explaining Hindu tradition were on display display at the ‘bommala koluvu’. “Sankranti is a festival of joy and ‘bommala koluvu’ is the very important element of Sankranti for girls. We are ignoring this tradition due to busy life. The exhibition arranged at the Durga temple is portraying the tradition and I have brought my grandchildren to the temple to show this,” said L Venkata Ramana, a retired railway employee.
 
 Thousands of Ayyappa devotees, who had ‘darshan’ at Sabarimala, visited the temple on their return journey. “This is my seventh visit to the temple on the ‘bhogi’ day. The ‘darshan’ of Goddess Kanaka Durga after Sabarimala ‘yatra’ is considered to be sacred and it took three hours,” said M Lakshmi Narasimha, a pilgrim from Kurnool.
