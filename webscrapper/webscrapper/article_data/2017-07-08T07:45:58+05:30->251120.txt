Pune: The second entry to   located along the Raja Bahadur Mill Road will be formally inaugurated on July 14, railways authorities said.

 The entry, which includes a foot over bridge (FOB) connected to all the six platforms in addition to a huge parking lot, will facilitate many passengers coming to the station.
 
 “The FOB and the parking area were thrown open for passengers around a month-and-a-half back. The facility will, however, be formally inaugurated with Pune MP Anil Shirole expected to do the honours. Like the existing parking lot in front of the main entry to the station, there will be a bay reserved for private company cabbies such as Ola or Uber or any other service. The plan has been a success and tenders for the new one will be floated soon,” a railway official told TOI.
 
 “The existing main entry is fine, but we felt the need for a second entry to make things easier for passengers. Moreover, the road along the main entry is single lane on both sides, which results in frequent traffic jams. However, with the second entry, people will have more than one option to enter the premises. The parking lot is huge and more work is being done to make it more passenger-friendly,” the official said.
 
 Atul Shastri, a passenger, said things have become more convenient. “My office is in Daund and this new entry is a boon. I live near the   and entering the station from the second entry is a better option than taking the main entry, where there is heavy traffic. People living in areas like Khadki, Dehu Road etc will prefer using this entry,” he said.
 
 Railway officials said that soon all the FOBs will be interconnected with the help of a skywalk, which will make things even easier for passengers.
