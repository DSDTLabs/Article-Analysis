Mumbai: A tripod-type boring equipment tilted and rested dangerously on a local   at   station where the Army is constructing a footover bridge (FoB), sparking rumours that the   had crashed on Wednesday. However, the railways downplayed the incident, saying there was no threat to train operations or passenger safety.

 A picture of the tripod’s head resting on the Electrical Multiple Unit (EMU) rake went viral, leading to buzz of another tragedy. But the Central Railway scotched the rumours soon. A senior official said, “The   was being shifted and it tilted.” The incident took place at 9.50am and the CSMT -bound train was held back for 7 minutes. The incident took place when the train was stationary. 
 
 However, CR’s divisional manager Sanjay Jain said the tripod was “deliberately made to rest while being shifted”.
 
  It did not fall nor did it pase any threat to the train or passengers.”
 
 A senior railway official said, “The workers could not balance the tripod because of which it tilted. Neither is the tripod heavy nor did it had sharp fall.”
 
 However, source said that the someone at the station immediately rushed inside the coach and pulled the alarm chain so that the train did not leave before the lifting of the tripod. Another one had rushed to the motorman cabin to alert him about this incident.
 
 Railway activist Subhash Gupta, who tweeted about the incident, said, “The incident is scary as no such work or movement of the construction material should be allowed when train operations are underway. I was tipped about this incident by an official who felt that the repercussion would have been severe if railways was carrying out this work instead of the army.”
 
 The army has been given a deadline of completing the work on the FOB at Currey Road as well as Ambivli and Elphinstone Road by January 31.”
