NEW DELHI: The   directed King Edward Memorial hospital in Mumbai on Friday to constitute a medical board to examine a pregnant woman who sought the court’s approval to abort her 23-week-old malformed  .

 A bench of Justices S A Bobde and L Nageswara Rao asked the hospital to file a report on the medical condition of the woman and whether she could be allowed to abort the foetus. The court said it would decide her plea after getting the report.
 
 The 21-year-old woman, identified as Mrs X in the writ petition, pleaded to the court to allow her to terminate the foetus as it did not have kidneys and would be unviable.
 
 “The petitioner found out in the 21st week of her   that the foetus doesn’t have kidneys. She had to undergo two scans before this could established and the foetus has multiple anomalies,” she said in her petition.
 
 The bench had in January allowed a 24-week pregnant woman, facing danger to her life due to abnormality in foetus, to terminate her pregnancy. The court had allowed a plea of the Mumbai-based 22-year-old woman to abort after taking into account her medical report which said there was very little chance of survival of the foetus and the woman’s life would be engendered if it was not aborted.
 
 Indian laws allow   till 20 weeks of pregnancy, but around half a dozen women have moved the   in the recent past seeking permission to abort beyond this deadline.
