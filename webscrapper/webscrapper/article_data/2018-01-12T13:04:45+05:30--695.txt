It’s a sad day for the music industry.   or   to the music lovers in Kolkata breathed her last in Chennai this morning. The powerful voice behind Pink Noise and Skinny Alley, she raised the bar for English music in the city. Jay was influenced by Pam Crain who she met in the ’70s, who taught her how to hold the mic, what to wear on stage and even how to behave. Jayashree lost her husband, Gyan, another veteran musician a couple of years back. After his death, she told us in an interview, “I was deeply involved in yoga and it used to be very intense. But after Gyan, I was not able to concentrate on it. Three years back, I discovered this Chinese tradition called Qigong. And now, I'm deeply involved in medical Qigong. This involves exercise, meditation and concentration. So, that's pretty much my life now. I practise it 4-5 hours a day and am studying the theory so that I can teach it. I feel much calmer and happy within myself.” Jayashree was suffering from   and moved to Chennai around two years back to be with her family.   of Someplace Else told us, “They last had a show at SPE some two years back. To me, both Gyan and Jay were like family. They would always ask me how I was doing and what was it like on my homefront every time we met. Also, she was deeply spiritual.” Chanda Dutt, wife of Anjan Dutt, wrote on FB, “Jay stay happy wherever you are till we meet again… you will be missed.” Wrote  , “It's just devastating. I'm just sad. I'll miss u like mad. I love u.”
