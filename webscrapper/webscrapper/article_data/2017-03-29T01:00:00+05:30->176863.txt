Apoorva Lakhia’s upcoming directorial venture, '  — The  ', has wrapped up with the final 45-day schedule in Mumbai. 
The film, which stars   in the title role, is based on the intriguing life of Haseena Parker, don Dawood Ibrahim’s sister, who had 88 cases registered against her, but was taken to court only once in her life.
 
 She was rumoured to have single-handedly run her brother’s `1000-crore underworld empire in the city. Interestingly, casting director   chose Shraddha’s brother, Siddhant, to play Dawood in the movie. It’s perhaps the first time in Indian cinema that real-life siblings will be seen playing bhai-behen on the screen as well. 
 
 With the story portraying Haseena from the age of 17 to 55, a lot of effort has gone into creating the right look for Shraddha. While her creative makeup has been done by  , her costumes have been designed by Eka Lakhani, in association with Thea Minhas and Ajay Mistry.
 
 The July 14 release, produced by Nahid Khan with Swiss Entertainment and co-produced by Sameer Antulay and Babu Tyagi, also stars Ankur Bhatia, Rajesh Tailang and Priyanka Sethia. The film’s soundtrack has been composed by Sachin-Jigar.
