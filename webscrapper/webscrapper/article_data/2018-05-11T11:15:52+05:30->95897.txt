HYDERABAD: A vacation bench of the Hyderabad High Court on Thursday refused to remove a restraint order that is lying in the way of finalising an Outer Ring Road ( ) toll fee contract over an extent of 135km around Greater Hyderabad. 

 The bench of Justice U Durga Prasad Rao and Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili heard the appeal filed by   (HMDA) and its Hyderabad Growth Corridor Ltd. The Bench noticed that a vacate stay plea was already filed before a single judge who passed the restraint order and directed appellants to take their contentions before the same court after the vacation. A single judge earlier directed the   not to finalise the bid following a plea by Inderdeep Constructions Company, operating the toll plazas earlier at 18 crore a month. 
 
 Telangana additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao told the court that they have got a new bidder who is offering more and hence wanted the court to accord them a green signal to go ahead. He asked why the state should suffer a loss just because a contractor chose to challenge the process. Moreover, he did not even participate in the latest bidding process. 
 
 Appearing for Inderdeep Constructions, senior counsel Vedula Venkata Ramana told court they challenged a clause in the fresh bid that eliminated several contractors. Authorities fixed a minimum of 21 crore per month and we see a design behind this to limit the contract to a select few, he said. 
 
 Following a plea by the additional advocate general, the bench accorded liberty to authorities to move a vacation court headed by a single judge next week.
