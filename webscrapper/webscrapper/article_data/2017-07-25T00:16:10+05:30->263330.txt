Trichy: A city-based environment organisation has called for a ban on the use of national flag made from plastic saying that it pollutes the environment and is in a way an insult to it. 

 While many states have banned the sale of it, they are calling upon the state government to follow suit. 
 
 Addressing a letter to the chief minister, members of the NGO Thaneer has called for a blanket ban on its usage. 
 
 “Production of plastic   will stop automatically once its sale and purchase is restricted. It is the state government which has to come forward by imposing a blanket ban on its sale,” said K C Neelamegam, secretary of Thaneer, adding that 21 states including Kerala has imposed a ban on its usage. 
 
 Unlike the past, the use of plastic flags is more prevalent in the past 2 decades especially during independence and republic days. However, these flags are later found in drains and vacant lands as pollutants.
 
 “We could see such used flags in drains which remain there for months together after being used on Independence or republic days, especially in schools,” said Neelamegam. 
 
 It is widely used in schools because of the fact that the flag is made of plastic prevents it from being easily torn and the chemical colour makes its shiny, he said.
 
 Advocating the usage of paper flags in schools, M Sekaran, president of Thaneer, said that such plastics are in a way insult to the national flag. The union government has been considering a ban on it and Tamil Nadu should be an example by imposing the ban ahead of Independence Day, he added. 
 
 Asked on the political flags made of plastics that are also widely used, he said that political parties should act responsibly by shunning its usage.
