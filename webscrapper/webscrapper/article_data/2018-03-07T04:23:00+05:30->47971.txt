Vadodara: The detection of crime branch (DCB) has picked up Karan Patel alias Jago, brother of history-sheeter Kalpesh Patel alias Kachiya, for questioning after a case was filed against him for threatening a key witness in three murder cases. 

 Rakesh Parekh, a transporter and farmer, had told the court during hearing in one of cases on February 27 that he had been receiving threats from Kalpesh, Karan, Deepak Dhobi, Ashok and Pappu. 
 
 After Parekh’s statement, court had ordered police protection for Parekh but he approached the crime branch and filed an FIR. The police said that Parekh had received summons to remain present in court on February 5 for his testimony. But around 10 days prior to the date, Ashok, Dhobi and Pappu came to Parekh’s office in Maneja and asked him to tell the court that he does not know anything and the police had made him sign on a pre-written statement. 
 
 He was also allegedly told not to identify accused Sanjay RDX in court. On February 4, Dhobi took Parekh to a restaurant to and allegedly threatened him to stick to what he was asked to do otherwise he will have to face the consequences. Later, Dhobi made Parekh talk to Kachhiya, who was in jail at that time. Kachhiya too threatened him. Parekh, who was under stress, did not go to court on February 5 after which he was summoned again on February 27. 
 
 Before going to court on February 27, Parekh was allegedly threatened to follow the instructions, but when his statement was being taken by the court he said that he was receiving threats for changing his statement. “We have picked up Jago for interrogating him. If his involvement is found in the threat case filed by Parekh then we will arrest him,” said a crime branch official.
