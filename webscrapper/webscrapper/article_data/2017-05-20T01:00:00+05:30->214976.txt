It’s never too late for new beginnings in life.   would agree. The actress, who is over 50 years old, says that she wants to give marriage another chance. “So, what if I am 50-plus? I want to get married again,” she says.

 And, this time around, she hopes that it will be a happily ever after.
 
 Divyajyotee had first got married when she was really young and became a mother at the age of 16. However, that relationship was not meant to be. She separated from her husband 19 years ago after their differences seemed irreparable.
 
 But there’s no bitterness in the actress, who says, “My ex-husband has been a great father to our three children and that matters the most to me. He has always helped them financially and given them the best of education.”
 
 Talking about her decision to find a new life partner, she explains, “I feel the need for a companion as I don’t like to be alone. My children are all grown up and settled in different cities. There should be someone I can share my darkest fears and successes with. He has to be well settled as financial security is important, too. We will take care of each other when we grow old.”
