NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party ( )   on Thursday told the Delhi high court that his statements against Union minister   were based on information relayed by chief minister  .

 Appearing in response to a court notice, Vishwas told Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw, before rendering an apology or taking a stand on the issue, he wants to know if his party leaders lied while issuing statements against Jaitley. Vishwas sought more time to ascertain if his party chief lied before he apologised to Jaitley or if the reason for his apology itself amounted to a lie. 
 
 On April 26,   had asked Vishwas to be present to clarify if he wanted to cross-examine Jaitley in the defamation suit. Vishwas claimed that Kejriwal and others agreed to apologise without including him in the decision-making process. His subsequent queries to them after the apology have remained unanswered, he said.
 
 Vishwas is the only one against whom the defamation suit remains after Kejriwal and four other AAP leaders tendered unequivocal apology to Jaitley in his defamation suit.
 
 Advocate Manik Dogra, appearing for Jaitley, refused to accept the Vishwasâ€™s stand that he was only responding to the call of his party leader, and argued that he had in the past claimed to have seen documents while making the allegations. 
 
 Taking note of his request, the court listed the matter for hearing on May 28.
