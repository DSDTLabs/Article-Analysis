Gumla: Three minor girls, who were trafficked from Gumla and later rescued from Delhi and Ranchi railway station by police and volunteers of Child Line, were produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) here on Thursday. 

 One of the girls, hailing from Bangru village in Palkot block, was rescued by Delhi police few months ago after she fled her house at Dwarka in Delhi. She was kept at a shelter home Nirmal Chhaya in Delhi.
 
 "I fled the house in sector-10 at Dwarka locality in Delhi where I was sent to work. I didn't like working there. After escaping, I sat near a park where I was spotted by police and was sent to the shelter home where I stayed for five months," the girl told TOI.
 
 She, along with four other girls from Bangru, was taken Delhi by an alleged trafficker, Dasru Lohra of Joriya village in Bharni block of Gumla, on the pretext of a job at Rs 6,000 per month in October last year. The remaining four are still in Delhi, she said.
 
 In a separate case, two other minor girls, one from Lalmadi village and another from Garbutoli, both under Sisai block, were rescued by volunteers of Child Line from Ranchi railway station when they were being trafficked to Chandigarh by Sunil Sahu. Sahu, police said, was known to one of the girls.
 
 “All three were handed sent to the children’s home in Gumla after being produced before the CWC,” one its members Sanjay Kumar Bhagat said.
