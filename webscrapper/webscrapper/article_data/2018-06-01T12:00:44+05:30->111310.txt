  is Mumbai’s top cop and is widely regarded as the man responsible for bringing down the city’s infamous mafia. However, Pasari faces charges of an illegal encounter and   (Nagarjuna) is appointed as the SIT chief to investigate. Shivaji and his team soon realise that there’s more to Pasari than meets the eye and wherever he goes, bodies seem to follow.
