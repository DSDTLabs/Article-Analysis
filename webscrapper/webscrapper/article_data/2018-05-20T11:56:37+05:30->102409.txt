HYDERABAD: As a pilot project to experiment with the engineered polymer wall system, the   ( ) has built a 250 square feet room for security guards at the Kattedan sports complex.

 
 Touted to be the first-ofits-kind for Hyderabad, GHMC officials said that through this project, they will study the possibility to using the same method to set up   and   meal counters (?5 meals) to reduce the cost of construction.
 
 “In this system, the raw material used is reinforced cement concrete (RCC) and polymer sheets. As the sheets are used to cover the RCC walls and there is no requirement for curing, it helps save on water and cement usually needed post construction,” said Dattu Panth, superintending engineer (south zone projects), GHMC. He added that the method also helps save time. “The construction time is reduced by more than half and the cost is reduced by at least 10%,” Panth said.
 
 His claims were corroborated by Hyderabad mayor  , who inspected the security room recently and approved the methodology used to build it.
 
 Experts also allayed concerns about the structural stability of the building. “Use of RCC walls is common across the country. Government agencies in many states are already using RCC as they are durable and cost-effective,” said C A Prasad, director of  , that worked closely on the project.
 
 According to him, the engineered polymer wall system also cuts down on the maintenance cost as it does not require regular plastering as is the case with concrete walls, which develop cracks after a few years.
