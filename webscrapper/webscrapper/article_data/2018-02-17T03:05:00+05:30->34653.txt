Gandhinagar:  , the second term BJP MLA from the Raopura seat in Vadodara, has been nominated for the speaker’s job by   BJP president Jitu Vaghani. Trivedi, was minister of state (MoS) for sports, youth and cultural affairs. 

 A criminal lawyer by profession, Trivedi will file his nomination on February 17. If no one from the Congress files their nomination, Trivedi will be unanimously declared the speaker. It is likely that in keeping with the tradition of the   being from ruling party, Congress may not oppose Trivedi’s nomination.
 
 Trivedi will take oath as speaker on February 19, the first day of the   session.
 
 As chief minister Vijay Rupani has not appointed an MLA from Vadodara as minister, it was somewhat expected that Trivedi would be nominated for speaker.
 
 Trivedi has a sound legal background but has limited experience as a legislator.
