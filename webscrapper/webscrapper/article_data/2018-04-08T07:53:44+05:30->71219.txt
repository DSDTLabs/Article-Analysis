GAYA: Job seekers having an MU degree may not need to make futile rounds of the university office to get their degree verified, a mandatory requirement for government and other public sector jobs. For, a process is underway to facilitate online verification of the universityâ€™s degrees.

 According to MU VC Prof  , degree verification has been included in the digitisation process being introduced by the university. The beneficiaries will include those seeking jobs outside the country. Even those going abroad for higher studies will benefit. 
 
 The digitisation project, the VC said, has been entrusted to the Consultancy Development Centre, an autonomous body attached with the department of scientific and industrial research. The agency was selected through open bidding.
 
 The move will also go a long way in checking plagiarism, a not-so-uncommon practice that has virtually corrupted the entire PhD and other research work.
 
 Asked about the earlier initiative to check plagiarism through Gyanganga, the digital repository of more than a lakh PhD dissertations submitted across the country, the VC said the   route to check plagiarism could not effectively take off for certain reasons.
 
 Earlier, the university made NET mandatory for enrolment for a PhD degree. As per the   guidelines of 2009, PhD degree aspirants are required to go through a rigorous scanning process that includes pre-PhD test, semester-long classroom course in research methodology, open viva and publication of at least two papers in peer-reviewed journals.
