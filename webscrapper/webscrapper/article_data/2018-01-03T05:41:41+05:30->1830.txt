KOLKATA:   and in-patient services in the city were largely unaffected by the pan India doctors’ agitation in protest against the proposed   (NMC) Bill. All branches of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in the city and elsewhere in the state observed a black day on Tuesday, in response to the 12-hour agitation call by the IMA headquarters in Delhi.

 IMA headquarters, which withdrew the agitation in the evening, had asked doctors across the country to stay away from their routine services from 6am to 6pm, sparing emergency and critical care services, on Tuesday. In Kolkata, however, the OPD services in both government and private hospitals continued without any disruption.
 
 The doctors wore black badges to support the stir. State medical council president Mrinal Majhi and IMA state secretary   took part in rallies calling the bill draconian.
 
 “Closing OPD services in such short notice would have inconvenienced patients as many of them come from the districts. Though we support the stir, we decided to provide normal services,” said a doctor of a private hospital off EM Bypass.
 
 Even as the agitation was on, the lower house sent the bill to the parliamentary standing committee on health, with   MPs playing a crucial role in it. The news came as a shot in the arm for agitating doctors. “We congratulate all political parties and leaders, specially the West Bengal chief minister who instructed her MPs in the Lok Sabha to stand up against the bill,” said the honorary president of Bengal Doctors’ Forum Rezaul Karim.
 
 “We’ll continue to fight till its withdrawn,” said Service Doctors’ Forum treasurer Swapan Biswas.
