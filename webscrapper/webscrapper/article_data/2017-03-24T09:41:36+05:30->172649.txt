GANDHINAGAR: BJP   from Vadodara Yogesh Patel has written an open letter to the state education minister   complaining about the “ongoing loot by several private schools in the name of fee” and lack of quality education in these schools.

  “When Prime Minister   was Gujarat chief minister, I had written to him to take action against the education mafia in the state. After my representation, the then education minister ordered free and compulsory education under the Right to Education and ordered regulation on non-granted non-government primary and higher education schools. However, corrupt school administrations are still charging very high fees from the parents. Some schools have started taking extra money from parents in the name of other services. They are taking advantage of the government’s policy of allowing 10% fee hike. Some are going beyond the allowed limit. Right to Free education has also been greatly been compromised in the state,” writes Patel. 
 
 Patel proposed a strict implementation of the fee regulation and not allowing fee hike every year. He has written to the minister to keep fee structure low and to check the loot by non-grant schools in the name of fee. Patel also highlighted the fact that some schools force parents to buy books and uniform from a particular shop only. 
 
 He has requested the minister to take steps to ensuring qualified teachers and playground in every school and collection of fees on yearly basis. tnn
