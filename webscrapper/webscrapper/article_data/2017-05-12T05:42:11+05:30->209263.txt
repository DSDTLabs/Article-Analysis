LUCKNOW: With allotment of contracts under way and work orders still not issued, it looks like LMC will miss its own   of May 31 to complete   of roads.

 The pace of proceedings suggests the corporation would not be able to complete the work even till June 15, the deadline set by CM Aditya Nath Yogi to make all city roads pothole-free.
 
 After all paperwork is over, it still takes a week to start the work. Though tenders had been announced on May 5, officials expect work orders to come by May 15 after all technical formalities with contractors are over. 
 
 According to LMC’s estimate, patching and repair work can take up to two months. A budget of Rs 22.9 crore has been earmarked to fix as many as 67 km of patches in 298 bylanes and inner colony roads of the city.
 
 The patches have been identified after a through survey. At most places, broken roads will be levelled and on some, interlocking tiles will be laid and mud patches will be cemented.
 
 Most roads identified are in areas of Hazratganj, Kaiserbagh, Aishbagh, Rajajipuram, Aliganj, Sitapur  , Triveninagar, Hardoi Road, Indiranagar and Gomtinagar.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner Nandlal Singh said, “All tender work is finished and we expect work to start from May 15. I think we will be able to complete all of it before the assigned deadline.”
