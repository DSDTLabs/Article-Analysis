MUMBAI: To ensure smooth running of the city’s first   service,   is considering capping the number of tickets to be sold to avoid overcrowding as only one rake will be available for operations.

 Trials are currently on for the 12-coach AC train, which is likely to be launched on the   sector in October. Though the timetable has not been finalized, sources said WR may run 12 services a day, including two in morning and evening peak hours.
 
 “We will have to restrict the number of tickets, including season tickets, to ensure that train does not get overloaded,” said a senior WR official. “If many people try to get into a coach and get stuck in the doorway, the train may not move on time.”
 
 In June, WR had proposed a queue system for passengers that would be monitored by pushers who would ensure no one gets stuck in the doorway and hold up the train.
 
 A railway official said it is possible that commuters with valid tickets may not be able to board a crowded AC train. “Since only one rake will be in operation, they will have a long wait for the next train. We fear commuters may demand refunds or create a ruckus if they do not get to board a crowded AC train.”
 
 WR is also yet to finalize the fare structure. A retired WR official suggested that the fare structure be modelled on that of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, with no concession being offered on season tickets. But others are of the view that the fare be equivalent to that of chair-car in mail/express trains. “If AC train fare is cheap, WR can expect overcrowding, but expensive tickets will ensure less patronage. A final decision on whether to cap the number of tickets sold will depend on the fare structure,” said a WR official.
