PUNE: The 5%   proposed for the micro small and medium enterprises ( ) will help in easing demonetisation-related pressure in the sector, but may not be enough to create substantial new jobs in the immediate future, experts said on Wednesday.

 “Clearly, more was expected from the budget to support the MSMEs,” an industry leader said, adding the tax cut won’t have any immediate impact on jobs.
 
 There are about 2,000-2,500 MSMEs in   employing about 5-6 lakh people. “The MSMEs’ gain due to the tax cut will be clear only after the rise in raw material costs is taken into consideration and their ability to pass that on in a low-demand environment,” said Anant Sardeskhmukh, director general, MCCIA.
 
 There are about 5.77 crore MSMEs in India. As per the data quoted by FM, just 1.2% of these filed their tax returns in FY 2015-16. “This number might double over the next year as more MSMEs will file returns to avail cheaper loans from banks,” said Milind Kamble, founder chairman, Dalit Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industries.
