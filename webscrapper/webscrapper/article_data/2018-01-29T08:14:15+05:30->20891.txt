RAJKOT: A gang of hooligans unleashed terror near a residential society in Aji Dam area by torching as many as 14 bikes and one car after Saturday midnight.

 The bikes and Maruti Eco car were parked outside   on  . At around 1am, the gang cut open the fuel pipes of the vehicles and set them ablaze one by one. Late in the night, the police arrested six persons including one minor for the crime.
 
 Those arrested were identified as Suraj Jabardan Gadhvi (21),   (20), Mukund alias Gullu Thakur (19), Parthraj alias Hardevsinh Jadeja (19) and Jignesh, all residents of various parts of the city. Aji Dam police station officials said that the gang merely wanted to terrorize people and create their scare among them. 
 
 Three of these six arrested were involved in a similar vehicle-torching incident reported from Dhoraji last week. 
 
 Police and fire brigade rushed to the spot and doused the fire. Police had recovered the footages from CCTVs installed near by but the images were very dark.
