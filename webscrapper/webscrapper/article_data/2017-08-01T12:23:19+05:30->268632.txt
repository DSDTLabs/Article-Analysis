PATNA: State   minister   has warned that action would be taken against “ghost” (absentee) teachers if they do not mend their ways.
 
  “Those who are in the job of teaching just to get salary should change their mindset or face the axe,” Verma said after taking charge at his office at Vikas Bhawan on Monday. He said the DMs and district education officers would have to ensure teachers attended school — and on time.
  
  The minister said his focus would be to improve education scenario and up attendance of students in schools.
  
  Recalling his school days, he said the situation has since bettered a lot in that schools have infrastructure like desks, benches and blackboards. “We used to sit on the floor... Our schools were thatched buildings,’ he said.
  
  Asked about the use of unfair means in examinations and recent topper scams, the minister said security around school examination centres and vigil inside examination halls have since been beefed up. “It was our bad luck that a topper scam pertaining to 41-year-old Ganesh Kumar alias Ganesh Ram happened again in 2017,” he said.
