NEW DELHI: From Wednesday, all taxable   coming from outside Uttar Pradesh to the state will need to have electronic way bill ( ) if their value is above Rs 5,000.

 IFTRT, a thinktank on transport issues, has termed this a regressive rule which will bring back inspector raj. It said GST had provisioned for digital uniform e-way bill to check consignments above Rs 50,000 irrespective of type of goods transported.Tax lawyer R S Sharma said, â€œFrom July 1 onwards, entry of taxable goods was allowed in UP without e-way bill. Now from July 26, movement of taxable goods coming from outside UP to the state will be under e-way bill.
 
 Further, for movement of specified goods like iron, steel and edible oil from one point to another within the state has to be under e-way bill, if value of goods is above Rs 1 lakh.
