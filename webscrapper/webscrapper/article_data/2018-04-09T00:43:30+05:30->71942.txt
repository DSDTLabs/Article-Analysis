Madurai: In a scathing attack on M K Stalin, Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan asked the DMK leader to quit bluffing the public and stop his padayatra play-acting for the Cauvery Management Board (CMB). He said that DMK and Congress should give up the protest as they were only staged dramas to please the public. The Cauvery dispute has been here for many years and it has to be resolved through dialogue rather than protests, he told reporters at the Madurai airport on Sunday. The minister said he was not happy with Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s stating Karnataka would have to give water to Tamil Nadu if Congress won the Assembly elections in that state. “This should have been condemned by Tamil Nadu Congress president S Thirunavukkarasar,” he said. “Former Karnataka Chief Minister Yedduyurappa has said that it would be attempted to resolve the issue through dialogue. Ask the DMK to stop its protest. They fooled the people in many issues including the Sri Lankan Tamil issue and fishermen issue. Where did the DMK go when the resolution on vice-chancellors’ appointments was passed in July last year?” He asked. “It is only the Opposition that said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not giving us time to meet him. “Is the chief minister or deputy chief minister saying so?” he asked.
