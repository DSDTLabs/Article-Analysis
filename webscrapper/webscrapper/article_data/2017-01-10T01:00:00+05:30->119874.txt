 turns 43 today. The superstar says that he will usher in his birthday with his family and two sons. That’s not all, with his home production ' ' all set to hit screens on January 25, the actor is also planning to party with the cast and crew of the film. In an exclusive chat with BT, Hrithik says, “I have been working on the post-production of 'Kaabil'. On my birthday, all I want to do is spend time with my family and children. There’ll also be a wrap-up party of sorts with the cast and crew of the film. I think I will have a great time surrounded by the people I love.” 

 The actor, who is devoted to fitness, points out that his concept of birthday has changed since he became a dad. “I look forward to the occasion because my children make interesting plans. They have the habit of writing to me on my birthday, so I eagerly await their notes, and they also look forward to it. It puts a smile on my face.”
 
 Interestingly, Hrithik’s debut film 'Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai' ('KNPH') had also released in January (14th). Does it make him nostalgic? 
 “I feel like I am travelling back in time. It reminds me of exactly what I had gone through during my first release. It’s a very strange feeling, and the reason could be that I have come a full circle. It’s almost like I am starting again. It’s been long since I’ve had the opportunity to put my heart and soul into a film,” he says, adding, “A film script is like a pool. The deeper it is, the deeper you can go, and I have had the opportunity to go into the depths of Rohan (his character in 'Kaabil')... The last time I felt like this was probably during 'KNPH' or ' '. It’s like going back to the basics.”
 
 Duggu also has a special message for his fans, who he credits for his success and stardom. “I thank my fans for all the love that I receive. Every birthday, I am made to feel cherished — I want to tell all my fans that what makes me special is them and I value their love,” he signs off.
