NEW DELHI: Following the new-found bonhomie between former CM Sheila   and Delhi Congress chief Ajay   and the ghar wapsi of former Delhi unit chief Arvinder Singh  , the party has got down to firm up a roadmap to steer its revival in the capital. 

 Congress has zeroed in on price rise, unemployment, sealing and gaps in the public distribution system (PDS) as the core issues to take on BJP at the Centre and the AAP government in Delhi, said a source. The poor impacted by the gaps in the ration system, unemployed youth and the traders impacted by the sealing drive will get priority, he added.
 
 While the high court is hearing the plea of AAP’s 20 disqualified MLAs in the office-of-profit case, Congress plans to use this time to lay the ground for the bypolls in case of an adverse verdict as well as for the parliamentary elections next year. The involvement of Congress president Rahul Gandhi with Delhi’s organisational re-design is a critical indicator of how serious the party is about regaining its lost ground, said the source. 
 
 On Monday, the Delhi   saw a   of all   with Maken sharing space at the head of the table with Dikshit. Besides a few former Delhi MPs, ex-ministers Lovely and Haroon   were present. AICC Delhi in-charge P C   also attended it. 
 
 While focusing on Delhi, the party has picked up price rise and unemployment as two key issues with a national appeal. While the issue of the sealing drive will be Delhi-centric, the PDS gaps will be highlighted to win back the city’s urban poor — AAP’s core constituency.
 
 Delhi Congress will begin the drive on March 4 with protests and padyatras against BJP and AAP in 280 blocks, said Maken. Senior functionaries will meet block representatives once every month to review the outreach plan and make necessary changes to strengthen the focus, he added. “Instead of centralised protests, it is felt that expanding outreach at the grassroots level is more important.”
