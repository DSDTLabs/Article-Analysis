CHANDIGARH: With no clarity so far from the estate office on percentage of   to be reserved by private schools under economically weaker section (EWS) and description of nominal fees, the admissions under the   quota is likely to suffer. The education department extended the date for submission of forms under EWS category from December to January 15 and the dates are expected to be further extended if things are not clarified within a week. This issue has been hanging fire from the past seven years.

 However, school education director   said, “We will settle the issue by the upcoming week.”
 
 On December 5, the education secretary, UT Chandigarh B L Sharma and Independent Schools Association held a meeting with assistant estate officer   to seek clarity on percentage of seats to be reserved by private minority and non-minority schools in Chandigarh under the land allotment scheme. However, they could arrive on no conclusion. 
 
 Thereafter, the education department had written to estate office asking them to clarify on the percentage of seats. Under Right to Education Act, schools have to reserve 25% seats for EWS students. This 25% is inclusive of seats to be reserved under land allotment scheme. For seats under RTE Act, the education department pays the reimbursement. However, no reimbursement is given for seats reserved under land allotment scheme.
 
 On the other hand parents from EWS category who are looking forward to admit their children under EWS category must submit the admission forms this week as the last date is January 15. The department had extended the date in December hoping that the matter will be clarified by then,   had reported.
 
 As per the data gathered by   in the academic year 2018-19, private schools will be offering 710 seats to students from economically weaker section under Right to Education Act in 49 schools.
