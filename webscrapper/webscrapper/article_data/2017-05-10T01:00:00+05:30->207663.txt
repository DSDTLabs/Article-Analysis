 has turned filmmaker with his new 20-minute movie in the Virtual Reality (VR) format. Rahman, who was in Noida recently to launch a prelude of his VR movie, spoke about this new experience. He said, "In a way, the line between filmmaking and music is blurred. You have to understand that both the things have a common purpose – to convey emotions."

  
 Rahman, who also launched his song (from his performance at the UN concert) in the VR format last year, said that anyone can choose to become anything they want. Commenting on the role reversals of actors and singers, he said, "I feel that you can do anything, but you just have to really delve into it. Now, directors are becoming composers and composers are becoming directors. It's just about how sincere I am (about the work I do), and shouldn’t cheat. I should excel at it. Even as a singer, I think I should do my best, I shouldn't go flat and my singing should have that feel. It’s not that acting belongs only to actors and singing belongs to singers."
 
  
  
 
  
 When asked about the things that   lacks which Hollywood has, Rahman said, "We are catering to our people (with the kind of content, music and films we have), and I think that it is important to create artistic leaders – that's the only place where we lack. What I am trying to do in Chennai is training students from across the country. They will become composers. It is our responsibility to make our people artistic leaders and make them learn to push for things and not just be sheep."
