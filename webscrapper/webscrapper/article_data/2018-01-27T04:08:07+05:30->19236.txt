NEW DELHI: Stressing that safety of people was the “supreme law” which could not be compromised at any cost, the   has directed authorities to ensure strict compliance of fire safety norms in hotels, restaurants and other public places to avoid recurrence of incidents like the Uphaar fire and the recent tragedy in a Mumbai pub in which 11 persons died. 

 “It is the prime duty, rather statutory duty, of police personnel/administration of every state to maintain and give precedence to safety and morality of people. Indeed, both are important and lie at the heart of the doctrine that the welfare of an individual must yield to that of the community,” a bench of Justices   and A M   said while upholding   government’s decision, making it mandatory for restaurant owners to seek prior permission for having live music band, cabaret dance and discotheques in their premises. 
 
 As per the law, the owners would be granted permission subject to fulfilment of various conditions, including that the material used in the building should not pose any fire hazard and there should be at least one emergency exit. It also says restaurants would not be allowed to hold shows which are immoral and indecent. 
 
 The association of restaurants challenged the provision saying the government was putting unreasonable restrictions which hampered their business. The bench, however, said making it obligatory to obtain licence to have cabaret, discotheque or live band was a reasonable restriction.
