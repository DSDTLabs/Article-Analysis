 Despite severe competition from other ports and also private ports like Gangavaram Port in the city limits, VPT has improved its position in cargo handling and stood on fourth place among all major ports in the country. It was on the fifth spot in 2016-17. 
 
 The ports at Kandla, Gujarat, and Paradip, Odisha, were on first and second spots with 110 MT and 101 MT respectively, while JNPT is on third position with 65 million tonnes.
 
 Krishna Babu said that the port registered 4% growth than the previous year. It had handled 63.54 million tonnes of cargo in 2017-18 as against the 61.02 MT in 2016-17.
