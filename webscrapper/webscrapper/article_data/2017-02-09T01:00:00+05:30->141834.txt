TV actors  ,   and   have travelled to   to shoot for the upcoming show, Koi Laut Ke Aaya Hai, a supernatural thriller. The entire cast is shooting in Gajner, a small tehsil near Bikaner. Some portions of the show have also been shot at Gajner Fort.

 
 Surbhi Jyoti, who is best known for her show Qubool Hai, is playing the lead. She says, “I’m playing a Bikaner girl in the show.

 Despite a packed shooting schedule, Surbhi manages to steal some time to enjoy herself. She says, “I have a very tight schedule. But I did I try some folk moves with a Kalbelia dancer at a musical evening organized at our hotel.” 
 The actress also talks about shooting in the chill wearing chiffon dresses. Surbhi says, “I like winters, but it is such a tough task to shoot in the open wearing a chiffon kurti. I am trying to pretend that I am not feeling cold, but I don’t think I can pretend anymore. For my previous show, I shot in the desert near Ajmer in July. Shooting in the scorching heat was another experience. So in a way, I have experienced both the summer and winter of Rajasthan.” 
 
 
 Rajasthan was recently in the news when members of the   vandalized the sets of Padmavati in Jaipur and attacked director Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Surbhi condemns the attack, but says that such incidents can’t malign the image of the state. “I don’t think one incident can malign the image of the state, neither am I going to judge anyone on that basis. Rajasthan is one of the most colourful and vibrant states in the country. Kuchh log kharab hain aur unhone galat kiya hai, but that does not mean that everyone is like that.”
