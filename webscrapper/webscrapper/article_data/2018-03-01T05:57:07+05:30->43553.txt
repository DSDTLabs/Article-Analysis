 The HC was hearing a PIL seeking a ban on the excess use of pesticides, traders using chemicals to ripen fruits and growth hormones used for livestock. The PIL claimed there were no standards. The bench expressed its concern that over 1,500 food samples that were sent to the laboratories under the FDA were pending for inspection.
 
 
 “Why are over a thousand samples lying in the laboratories. How will you bring these down to zero. If the samples are found to be adulterated, then imagine the consequences to children who are consuming these food articles,” observed the judges.
 
 The state informed that it was launching criminal proceedings against those who adulterate food. “Prosecution alone is not enough,” said the judges.
