“Ever since my visit to India in 2010, I have been fascinated by the country, its art, traditions and colours. So, when I decided to pursue fashion designing, I zeroed in on India for its rich colours, textures, intricate jewellery designs and embroideries. Back home, the designs are more straightforward and plain. 

 I have a great connection with Mumbai. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be, fast. It is also high on fashion. My classmates and faculty make me feel at home. 
 
 While the people here are warm and welcoming, it’s always better to be street smart. I often go street shopping here and enjoy bargaining with the shopkeepers.
 
 During my stay here, I have also been to other places in India — Goa, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, New Delhi and  . I love the variety of cuisines these places offer. My favourites are ' ', 'dosas', 'parathas' and 'idlis'. 
 
 It’s my second year in the city. I don’t know whether I will settle here or not, but I know one thing — I am not done with India just yet.”
