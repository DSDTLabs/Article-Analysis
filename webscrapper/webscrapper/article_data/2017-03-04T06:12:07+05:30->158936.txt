GURUGRAM: A man filed a complaint against his neighbour on Thursday after the latter’s pet dog attacked the complainant’s 9-year-old granddaughter.

 According to complainant Jal Singh of Baghanki village, the attack happened on the afternoon of February 25 when the Rottweiler suddenly entered their house and attacked the girl while she was playing.
 
 “Before anybody could intervene the dog had bitten her all over. We rushed her to private hospital where doctors said she needed 2-3 major operations. The owner of the dog didn’t bother to help us with the treatment,” Singh told the police.
 
 The victim’s family also alleged that the dog owner, identified as Rakesh, has a number of such ferocious dogs, posing a threat to neighbours. The injured girl is reportedly out of danger and is recuperating in the hospital.
 
 Police have lodged an FIR against the dog owner under sections 289 (negligent conduct with respect to animal), 323 (causing hurt) of IPC at the Manesar police station.
 
 “The child was attacked on February 25 but a complaint was filed only on Thursday,” said inspector Jagdish Prasad, SHO.
