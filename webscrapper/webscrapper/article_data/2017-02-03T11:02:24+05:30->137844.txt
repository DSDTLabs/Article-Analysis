KOCHI: The high court on Thursday dismissed appeals filed by   leaders P Jayarajan and T V Rajesh MLA questioning a further investigation by   into their alleged roles in the conspiracy behind the murder of Muslim League worker Abdul Shukkoor. 

 The further investigation by CBI was ordered by a single bench of the high court in February, 2016 after the   government informed that a proper probe could not be conducted due to intimidatory tactics played by CPM. Shukkoor was hacked to death at Taliparamba in Kannur in 2012, allegedly by CPM workers in retaliation to an attack on the vehicle carrying Jayarajan and Rajesh. Jayarajan is the 32nd accused while Rajesh is the 33rd accused in the case.
 
 While asking CBI to conduct an additional probe, the single bench had specifically pointed out that all those who were with the party leaders at Room No. 315 of   at Taliparamba were booked for conspiracy (section 120B of Indian Penal Code) in the final report but the leaders came to be avoided from the charge. Instead, they were booked for not trying to prevent the murder after getting information about the conspiracy (section 118).
 
 In the petition seeking a CBI probe that was considered by the single bench, the victim's mother had alleged that police was unable to collect evidence due to stiff resistance and intimidation by CPM. While issuing the order for a further investigation, the single bench had stated that criminal justice will become a casualty if self-proclaimed kings of a locality are permitted to rule in the matter of investigation.
 
 While upholding the single bench's order, the division bench said the order was issued by properly appreciating the facts in the case and held that no interference is warranted. The division bench dismissed the contention of the appellants that the single bench's order was issued by only taking into consideration the anguish of the victim's mother.
