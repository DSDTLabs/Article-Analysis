PATNA: Women who have reached   should conduct pelvic muscles-strengthening exercises to get rid of bladder control problems or urinary incontinence.

 This was advised by medical experts at a conference on ‘Late Complications of Menopause’ organised by   to coincide with the installation of its office-bearers for a two-year term. While Dr Usha Didwania was installed as the president, Dr Renu Rohatgi will be the vice-president, Dr   the secretary and Dr   will be the treasurer.
 
 “The average menopause age in India is 47.6 years. The female body stops generating oestrogen harmone after the natural cessation of menstruation. Apart from controlling the menstrual cycle and physical changes during pregnancy, oestrogen also helps keep the bladder lining and the urethra healthy and strong,” said Indian Menopause Society’s national president Dr Ratnabali Chakraborty.
 
 Older women experience weakening of pelvic floor muscles which are responsible for bladder control, resulting in urinary incontinence. “At times of coughing, sneezing or lifting heavy objects, leakage occurs through the weakened muscle. It is called stress incontinence,” Dr Chakraborty explained and advised such women not only to conduct pelvic muscle exercises but also to control diabetes if they are diabetic. 
 
 “They can also opt for surgery to lift the sagging bladder. That may solve the problem,” she said, adding menopausal women are more predisposed to health issues caused by metabolic syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that manifests itself after the body stops generating oestrogen.
 
 “These health issues include increased blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, weight gain and high levels of cholesterol, which increases their chances of experiencing heart stroke,” Dr Chakraborty said and underlined the importance of lifestyle management from an early age to prevent such post-menopause complications.
