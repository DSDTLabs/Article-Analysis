 Police said on December 8, 2016, Rao knocked the door of Sunita Doiphude’s flat at Bail Bazaar in Kurla (W). “He told her that her husband and school-going son would die in a bike accident unless she allowed him to conduct a ritual,” said inspector  . “He told her to put her mangalsutra and gold earrings in a utensil, keep it in the puja ghar and began chanting. He then asked her to fetch a glass of water. As soon as she entered the kitchen, he vanished with the ornaments.” A few days later, he targeted Bhandup housewife   using the same modus operandi. 
 
 Based on a tipoff, the anti-robbery squad arrested him from Ghatkopar.
