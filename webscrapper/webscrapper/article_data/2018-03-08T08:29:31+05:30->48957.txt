AMRITSAR: The   district administration, in order to improve the district's sex ratio at birth, took a traditional approach to successfully getting the message across to the masses. The places of worship were involved in the project and were asked to urge and exhort people not to discriminate against the girl child and give girls opportunities to grow in society. 

 This move was the key to improving the district's sex ratio at birth (SRB) to 880 females per 1,000 males within a year. Earlier, the SRB was 840 girls per 1,000 boys.
 
 "Tarn Taran is among the top 10 districts of India selected by the Union ministry of women and child development for its exemplary performance to mark the third anniversary of 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' campaign at Jhunjhunu in   on Thursday," informed former deputy commissioner of Tarn Taran D P S  , the brain behind involving religious institutions in inspiring people towards an egalitarian society.
 
 Prime Minister   will be honouring Kharbanda and current DC of Tarn Taran Pardeep Sabharwal on the occasion.
 
 Kharbanda, who was on his way to Jhunjhunu to receive the award from the PM, said he had issued letters to all 'granthis' of gurdwaras and 'pujaris' of temples to inspire people in their daily morning prayers from the public address system to give equal opportunities to both boys and girls and not to think of female foeticide. "It worked when we noticed increase in the SRB after a year or so," he said.
 
 He also informed that the administration had put up male-female sex ratio billboards in every village so that the common man could understand how drastic the situation regarding female foeticide was.
