 seems to be guarding more and more secrets of late. His SohamSubhashree starrer, Amar Aponjon, left Tolly star   miffed. The actor, who starred in Raja's movie, Bachchan, in 2014, was hoping to start work on the remake of Tamil film Autograph after the release of  's Boss 2. But before he could plan ahead, Raja had already remade the same film as Amar Aponjon. Trouble started when  , who is one of the producers, and Jeet both claimed that they had the territorial rights of the remake. Last week, I told you how the release of the film was quietly pushed back after Jeet reportedly moved court asking for compensation. Now I hear the matter has been settled out of court and Jeet is happy with the hefty sum he was paid.It's heartening that the film is releasing on its expected date, but I would love to know what Jeet is doing after his Eid release.
