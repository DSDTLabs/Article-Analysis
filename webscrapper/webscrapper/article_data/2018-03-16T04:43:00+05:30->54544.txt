Ahmedabad: Highlighting the potential for collaboration between India and the United Kingdom (UK) on the business front, British deputy high commissioner to Gujarat, Geoff Wain, said investors from the UK are looking to invest in Indian startups. He interacted with the media at the sidelines of an innovation conference in Ahmedabad on Thursday. Wain threw light on projects for collaboration between UK and Gujarat on the academic and commercial front.

 “In addition to British investors looking to invest in Indian startups along with technology transfer by UK-based companies to their Gujarat counterparts, for further collaboration under government initiatives, we are also looking at facilitating a two-way investment ecosystem so firms based in Gujarat can also invest in UK companies,” Wain said.
