MUMBAI: The BEST Workers’   called off its indefinite bus strike starting Thursday and the BEST administration put on hold the processing of files pertaining to wet-leasing 450 buses till March 5, after an industrial court order late Wednesday evening.

 Sources said the undertaking had moved court at the eleventh hour to prevent a strike in the city.
 
 The court is already hearing a petition filed by unions against wet-leasing of buses by the transport undertaking, and the next date is scheduled for March5. So, the court order mentioned that neither can any union go on strike nor can the BEST administration execute its plan of hiring 450 new buses—200 AC mini, 200 non-AC mini and 50 midi buses—till that date.
 
 This means, the first batch of 25 new buses that were to arrive in the city in May will now be delayed, said sources. “We were planning to issue the work order for the new buses next week. But now this will be delayed ...We will strictly abide by the court directive,” said a senior BEST official.
 
 Union leader Shashank Rao had called for a strike from Thursday as workers feared that involving private contractors to run buses would mean “privatization of fleet” and feared retrenchment of staff.
 
 On Wednesday, Rao met BEST general manager Surendrakumar Bagde, BEST committee chairman Anil Kokil and had a separate meeting with   commissioner Ajoy Mehta, but the meetings were “unsuccessful”. “We called off the strike only on court orders,” Rao said.
