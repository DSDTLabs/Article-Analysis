Surat: Husband of a BJP municipal councillor was nabbed red-handed by the anti corruption bureau (ACB) team while accepting a bribe of Rs five lakh near his house in Godadara on Thursday. 

 Police also booked his wife for involvement in the case.
 
 Police arrested Dinesh Babu Rathod Ahir, husband of Meena Rathod, the BJP municipal councillor from ward 25 in Surat Municipal Corporation. He had demanded Rs five lakh cash from the complainant to allow his unauthorised construction of a school. In the recent past, an illegal portion of the school structure was demolished by the SMC authorities following RTI applications filed by some local residents in the area.
 
 The complainant’s partner was constructing the school building and they were told by a known person that the councillor could ensure that the building won’t be razed even if it is illegal. Hence, the complainant had approached the accused and finalised the deal. Meanwhile, he approached ACB and lodged complaint after which the trap was laid.
