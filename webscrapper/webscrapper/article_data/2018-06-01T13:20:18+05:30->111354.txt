NEW DELHI: India and Indonesia have agreed to 

 
   upgrade their ties to comprehensive strategic partnership 
 
 as the two countries signed 15 agreements including one on defence cooperation after extensive talks between Prime Minister   and   Joko Widodo in Jakarta.

 
 The two leaders highlighted potential areas of cooperation in marine, economy, and socio-culture as well as discussed regional and global issues. 
 
 The highlight of Prime Minister Modi’s Indonesia visit, strategically speaking, was the military access India got to the country’s  . That adds to our growing naval heft in the neighbourhood. 
 
 
 
 
  Its position at the mouth of Malacca Strait makes it crucial. Malacca Strait is the main shipping lane between Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean and one of the busiest sea routes. The deep sea port (deep enough for submarines too) will help counter China's rising maritime influence in the region.
 
  
  
 
 
  India gained military access to the port on Oman’s southern coast this year. Duqm, on the northwestern edge of Indian Ocean, provides easy access to Red Sea
 
 
 
  
 
 
  This one is close to Pakistan's Gwadar port where China has invested heavily. It also falls on the North-South Transport Corridor (NSTC) that links India to Central Asia and Europe
 
 
 : On paper, this is purely an infrastructure project. The agreement had to be revised due to political opposition in Seychelles but broadly it signals a step forward for India’s strategic interests
