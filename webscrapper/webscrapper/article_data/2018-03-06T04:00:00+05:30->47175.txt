Surat: A major repair work at Katargam GIDC tank is likely to affect water supply to nearly 8 lakh citizens living in Katargam and Varachha zones of the city as they are likely to get no water or supply at low pressure on Tuesday. 

 Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) is undertaking a major repair and replacement work of the 1,200 mm valve in Katargam GIDC water tank from Monday midnight. A similar repair work will affect regular water supply in Rander zone on March 7. 
 
 Poor monsoon has led to less water supply to the city from Ukai dam on river Tapi. Instead of 350 million cubic metre (MCM) water till June first week, SMC will be getting about 280 MCM water this year. SMC has already announced water cuts of up to 10% and implemented it by bringing down daily water supply to city from 1,250 million litre per day (MLD) to 1,150 MLD. Presently, Katargam zone of SMC that was supplied 130 MLD of water on daily basis will be getting 73 MLD less water on the Tuesday. This means less or no water for Katargam, Ved and Dabholi areas. Similarly, in Varachha, the normal water supply is 126 MLD. However, with repair work on the leaking valve water supply is likely to be affected and supply could be reduced to 100 MLD. “Our efforts are to supply water as early as possible by completing repair work . However, unless the valve is replaced it would be impossible to continue water supply,” a senior official of hydraulic department of SMC said. tnn
