Ahmedabad: Gujarat high court has refused to interfere in a habeas corpus petition demanding that the release of a woman detained by Special Operation Group (SOG) on allegations that she is a Bangladeshi citizen living in India illegally.

 On January 7, Rangeelakhatun Mandal and another woman, Payona, were detained from the highway near Gota, where these women live and work as domestic help in the locality. Both women were detained as Bangladeshi citizens living here without proper documents. Since then, they have been under detention. Payona was released four days ago, one day before the HC turned down the habeas corpus petition filed by Rangeelakhatun’s husband Zakirhussain Mandal.
 
 In his petition, the husband claimed that the family belongs to Kolkata in West Bengal. He even furnished copies of Rangeelakhatun’s voter ID, Aadhar card etc. to establish that his wife holds Indian citizenship. He submitted that all the documents related to his wife’s citizenship were supplied to SOG officials, but they did not heed them and continue to hold the woman in detention.
 
 SOG officials maintained that there is prima facie material to believe that the woman is a Bangladeshi national staying in India without permission.
 
 The high court asked the officials to bring the woman before the court and the judges ascertained that she was not ill-treated by cops under detention. However, the HC turned down the petition on the grounds that the question of nationality of the woman cannot be decided in the habeas corpus petition. Since the issue of nationality remained undecided, the family could bring the facts to the notice of concerned ministry.
