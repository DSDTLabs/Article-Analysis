HYDERABAD: At a time when viewership on the   (VR) platform is slowly increasing in the country, a city-based NGO has made the world’s first ever VR   on human trafficking to make the narrative as close to reality as possible.

 ‘Notes to My Father,’ made by Hyderabad-based   is based on the true story of a trafficking survivor from a village in Andhra Pradesh. The 11-minute documentary is an emotionally churning account of survivor Ramadevi and her father Kullayappa, who unwittingly pushed her into the sex trade.
 
 The documentary, directed by Mumbai-based filmmaker Jayisha Patel, is set to make its world premiere at the prestigious South By South West (SXSW) Festival on March 14-16 in Austin, Texas. After this, it will make its way to India in May.
 
 The documentary shows Ramadevi penning a letter to her father recounting the horrors of her past in a brothel. Through the moving narrative, she reaches out to her father and talks about her pain and hopes of saving her own daughter from suffering a similar fate.
 
 Ramadevi was married off at a young age by her father, who worked as a daily wage labourer in Andhra Pradesh. He had assumed that her husband’s house would be the safest place for her, but after the marriage soured, she was sold off to a broker who forced her into prostitution. She managed to escape a year later and now works to raise awareness about human trafficking.
 
 “Virtual reality is the closest thing we can offer to people. It is more tangible and more engaging. We are already seeing that the movie is very impactful as one gets to see the emotions from close quarters,” said Hannah Norling, head of marketing and communications at My Choices Foundation, one of the film’s producer.
 
 The documentary forms the core of an awareness campaign titled ‘The Good Father’ by Operation Red Alert of My Choices Foundation, which is aimed to prevent human trafficking in the country.
