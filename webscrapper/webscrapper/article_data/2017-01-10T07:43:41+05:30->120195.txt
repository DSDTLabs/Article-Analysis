GUWAHATI:   demonstrated in front of the   (SSA) office here on Monday in   against the   being paid to them over the past  . 

 The agitators, who power the midday meal scheme in thousands of government-run schools of the state, sought better pay. They also said they would bring the scheme to a halt if their demands were not fulfilled.
 
 "Midday meal workers in Assam get only Rs 1,000 every month. In some other states, the respective governments are paying such workers more than the wage fixed by the Centre. In Assam, the state government has not given us anything extra. This is extremely humiliating. We want the government to hike our wages or face further protests," said Bibekananda Adhikary, working president of the Sadou Asom Madhyahna Bhojan Karmachari Union.
 
 Workers of the union alleged that the state government was slowly handing over the management of the midday meal scheme to private NGOs, which, they said, had made them even more vulnerable. "After the NGOs were roped in for the midday meal scheme, many workers are not event getting the Rs 1,000 that is due to them," Adhikary said.
 
 The union demanded that the state government give official recognition to midday meal workers, many of whom are being changed at the behest of the respective school management committees.
 
 In a memorandum sent to education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, the union demanded that the state government sanction an additional Rs 5,000 per month to the workers at the earliest. Midday meal workers get wages for 10 months a year and the union also demanded that they get money for the entire year.
 
 "At a time both the Centre and the state government are focusing on empowering women, they should look into the plight of a large chunk of women who are engaged as midday meal workers. They are not even getting minimum wages to fulfil their basic needs," said general secretary of the union, Chitra Rajbongshi.
