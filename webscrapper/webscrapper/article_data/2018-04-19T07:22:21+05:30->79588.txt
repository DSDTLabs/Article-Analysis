HYDERABAD: The battle for supremacy in poll-bound   is not just being fought on the ground.   in the US are also on the job of setting an agenda on what should be discussed on social media so that it could trend. The idea is to laud the BJP and show the   in poor light. And, to execute it some topics are given with a specific hashtag to trend on Twitter.

 
 
  
 
 TOI has got a list of tweets that were asked to see the hashtag #SidhuTopsinCrime trends.
 
 The ' ', which ostensibly functions from the US, provided several sample tweets that were put out on social media from 8am (IST) on Tuesday (April 17). On Wednesday morning, Namo Warriors ensured #ShahSaffronSurge was trending on Twitter.
 
 At the end of the day, it garnered over 12,000 tweets.
 
 The May 12 polls in Karnataka are turning out to be interesting as both the BJP and the Congress are fighting it out bitterly on social media, poking fun at each other, and losing no opportunity to take a dig at one another. A few days ago, the BJP’s Karnataka unit found the downpour in Bengaluru something good enough to lash out against Karnataka chief minister  .
 
 
 
 “No matter how much Siddaramaiah spends on his ads, these bloody rains hit Bengaluru for just 2 hours and totally puncture Siddu’s claims! ‘Varuna’ is playing spoilsport with Siddaramaiah everywhere!” BJP Karnataka tweeted on April 16. While cheeky tweets are on the spur of the moment, the more organised way is to put out tweets with a trendy hashtag. Links of stories that have appeared online are also provided with the tweet.
 
 However, the Overseas Friends of BJP, USA, which works on how to get tweets trending, does not list this among its six objectives. They aim “to work towards projecting a positive and correct image of India and its people in the US and foreign media, and correct any distortions in the media’s reporting of current events taking place in India”, and “to promote philosophy of Integral Humanism”.
