Renowned   artist and writer   recently graced a workshop in the city that aimed at raising awareness on tribal folk art among the city folk. The three-day workshop that turned the spotlight on Gond art, had around 50 young artists from the city in attendance. “In India, we have around 3000 different crafts and arts. But the people who live in cities are barely aware of most of them. my main motivation is to give the urban folk a feel of traditional arts, so that they can understand and appreciate our artforms,” he told us, ahead of the workshop.
As the masterclass began, Shyam introduced the ancient art form of the Gond tribe, indigenous to  ,  ,  , Maharastha,   and Odisha. “The Gond art began as a decorative tradition and the tribes used mud colour to fill their walls, ceilings, and floors with art,” he explained. But they now use canvas and paper, and paints instead of mud colours. “The speciality of Gond art is that we depict ideas, concepts and even objects for that matter in the form of trees, animals and birds. For example, the first time I saw an aeroplane I depicted it as an elephant. Because aeroplane is the largest vehicle that I have seen and elephant the largest animal,” he shared, laughing. 
 Shyam went on to add, “The Gonds create signature patterns to give a certain texture to the paintings. There are certain signature motifs that are the essence of this tribal art form, however, the individualism of each Gond artist can be observed in his signature style.” 
 The participants got to know all aspects of Gond art — from the history to motifs, themes, sketching and colours. The lessons began with Shyam teaching them how to outline a painting and then went on to explain how it can be filled up. Participants were then guided on how to express their own ideas using the aesthetics of the Gond tradition.
