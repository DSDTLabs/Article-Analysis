BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh ATS on Sunday produced two more accused –   of Delhi and Sanyog Singh of Chhatarpur – before district court here on Sunday. Both were arrested on Saturday.

 They have been remanded to police remand till February 23. Abdual Jabbar, 62, was arrested from   area in New Delhi for his alleged links with   who was arrested a few days ago. Sources said Sanyog Singh was also closely associated with Balram and used to operate some of his bank accounts. Balram used to dispense money to various channels using Jabbar even as Sanyog played the role of a courier.
 
 Balram Singh, 26, a resident of Suhash village in Satna district of Madhya Pradesh, became part of the cross-border lottery fraud two years ago and was apparently used by Pakistan handlers to transfer money to their ‘moles’ in India, said sources. His named had cropped up during investigations into monetary transactions of two alleged ISI ‘spies’ caught by security agencies from Jammu in November last year. Satvinder Singh alias Bittu and Dadu alias Lucky were arrested from Suchetgarh while they were moving around in suspicious circumstances. Investigations revealed they were providing vital security related information to Pakistan through WhatsApp groups. During the investigation, police came to know that they were collecting secret information regarding “locations of army, police and other security forces” and subsequently supplying the same to Pakistan through WhatsApp groups. The money they got in return was deposited in their bank accounts. When the bank transactions were investigated, it was found that cash was deposited in Satvinder’s bank account from Satna district in Madhya Pradesh.
