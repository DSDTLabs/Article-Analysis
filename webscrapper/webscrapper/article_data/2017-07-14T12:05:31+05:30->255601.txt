AMRITSAR: The parents and well-wishers of Nanak Singh alias Kakar Singh, have expressed anger over Pakistan’s denial that their son is languishing in its jail. 

 Talking to TOI on Thursday, Nanak’s father   said, “He was very young when he accidently crossed the border. I am sure he would have told his name as Nanak Singh but Pakistan Rangers would have recorded Kakar Singh instead.”
 
 Nanak, then 5, had accidently strayed into Pakistan in 1985 while working in the fields in village Kot Razda Bedi Channa in   sector of Amritsar. He was spotted by Pakistan Rangers after his family announced that over the local gurdwara’s public address system.
 
  (ISF) president Keshav Kohli, who had raised the issue of Nanak being imprisoned in Pakistan’s Kot Lakhpat jail as Kakar, told TOI that they had sent all the relevant documents to Union external affair minister   and were waiting for her reply.
 
 He said in 1999, local police had gone to the house of Rattan with a list of prisoners lodged in Kot Lakhpat jail. “There was a name of Kakar Singh, son of Rattan Singh, resident of Kot Razda Bedi Channa village in the list. Since the names of father and village name are same so we believe it is Nanak who is lodged in jail on mistaken identity. Government should explore on these lines to bring back Nanak,” said Kohli.
 
 He said ISF had made multiple representations to Pakistan Prime Minister   to personally intervene and ensure release of Nanak.
 
 The ISF had paid homage by offering chadar (sacred spread) at the tomb of Sharif’s great grandfather Mian Mohammad Baksh at his native village Jati Umra near Amritsar on June 10, 2016, said Kohli, adding, “Our gesture was out of respect and in return we had expected Pakistan to identify Nanak, lodged under the name of Kakar. However, Pakistan has out rightly rejected his presence there. Now we have decided to go back to Mian Baksh’s tomb and remove the chadar as mark of protest.”
