CHANDIGARH: Police resorted to mild use of force and apprehended Haryana Pardesh   Committee ( ) president Ashok   as he attempted to enter Chandigarh from Panchkula along with his supporters on Monday.

 Tanwar had given a call to lay siege on the residence of Haryana chief minister   as the first leg of ‘Haryana Bachao Parivartan Lao Cycle Yatra,’ which started from   earlier in the morning.
 
 Accompanied by supporters from across Panchkula (urban) and Kalka assembly constituencies, Tanwar pedaled for 15kms to reach Panchkula to enter Chandigarh from the Mansa Devi Complex.
 
 There was a heavy police deployment to prevent any untoward incident. The commuters on the Chandigarh-Kalka route were affected due to the cycle rally.
 
 While addressing the gathering in Kalka, Tanwar said their march would stop in Haryana only after gifting all 10 seats of the Lok Sabha to the Congress and helping the party form the government in the state.
 
 “Come what may, Congress’ struggle will not stop. This is fight against the failures and wrongdoings of the BJP government in the state and at the Centre. I am not afraid of being arrested. Government cannot suppress the voice of the common man now,” said Tanwar.
 
 Referring to his preventive arrest, Tanwar said it was an act done by the state to shield the failures of Manohar Lal Khattar-led government. “Law and order situation has gone from bad to worse. Farmers are at the mercy of God and the traders too have planned to leave the state. That’s why so many people have joined our march,” he said.
