GURUGRAM: Malls, hospitals, plazas, hotels and even   are likely to come under the dragnet of renewable energy department, which has made it mandatory for them to carry out an energy audit that will curb  . This, the government hopes, will bring Gurugram’s peak load — which stands at 1,400 MW — down by 30%.

 Invoking Section 18 of the  , 2001, the department of renewable energy passed new guidelines, making it mandatory for power consumers, drawing a connected load of 1 MW or more, to get an energy audit conducted by an auditor accredited by the   (BEE), within 18 months from the date of notification. 
 
 “Within two years, these consumers shall take necessary actions for implementation of the recommendation of the energy audit report, and furnish details of action taken on the recommendations within three months of the lapse period of two years from conducting the energy audit,” the order copy reads. 
 
 “This audit will check the units of energy they are consuming and the number of units they could have conserved,” an official from the department told TOI. 
 
 The order was passed on November 9, 2016, but following the “dismal” response from consumers, the state principal secretary for renewable energy Ankur Gupta, last week, notified officials about the urgency of the auditing, said sources.
 
 The order also fixes a penalty in case consumers fail to act on the expiry of the three years and six month period from the date of issuance of notification.
