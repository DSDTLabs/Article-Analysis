LUCKNOW: Dr   (RMLIMS) has been questioned on a delay in informing the health department about its   students reportedly being dengue positive. The chief medical officer ( ) has written to the institute director in this regard. The institute was also served a notice by the district health team for creating conditions conducive to mosquito breeding in several parts of the campus.

 After the notice, RMLIMS provided details of 13 other dengue positive persons it had tested between September 15 and 22. The institute had not provided this information to the CMO.
 
 On Monday , when a team of health officials inspected the institute demanding details of the MBBS students reported dengue positive by the institute earlier, RMLIMS claimed that while card testing had shown positive signs, Elisa testing later showed eight negatives and one equivocal (needing re-test) case.
 
 â€œNo student is dengue positive at the institute but the situation of stagnant   on campus could definitely lead to such cases. Notices have been served. Special attention will be paid to RMLIMS for the next one week," said additional CMO Dr SK Rawat.
