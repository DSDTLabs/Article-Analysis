It’s funny, how we don’t easily root for ‘adulterous’ characters without prejudice. It’s because we seldom make room for narratives about the relationships that exist beyond society’s definition of what’s “morally acceptable”. Cinema has sensitively dealt with the subject in the past, but when it comes to theatre, the dynamics change, says actor  .

 Playing director for his debut play  , a Hindi adaptation of Bernard Slade’s 1975 romantic comedy Same Time, Next Year, Sharman says, “The play does not preach about morality, but it acknowledges the fact that there are some relationships that cannot be labelled, but they exist and mature beautifully like all others.”
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Main aur Tum, that will be staged in the city tonight, tells the story of two people (essayed by Sharman and Marathi actress  ), who are both married to others, but meet for a romantic tryst once every year. 
 Though the subject has been treated with utmost gravity before, this play employs wit and humour. “The beauty of the characters and how they change with time is far greater than the need to name their relationship. The greater challenge is to bring out these intricacies and show how both characters evolve with time in the same space,” Sharman explains.
 
 The play has had over 30 shows till date. “Audiences across, barring one city, welcomed the concept, which goes to show how audience sensibilities have matured,” says Sharman. Tejashri, who features as Tanvi in Satish Rajwade’s   — which also speaks about first love existing even after marriage, adds, “Marathi audiences, who appreciated my role as an adarsh bahu on TV, also welcomed my transition to Tanvi’s character. They have begun embracing narratives where the protagonists love each other, whether there’s a happily-ever-after or not, and that’s a step forward.”
