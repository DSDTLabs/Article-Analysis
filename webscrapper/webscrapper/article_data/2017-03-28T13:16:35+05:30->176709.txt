THANE: The enthusiastic response seen at the early stage of the   admission process this year seems to have fizzled out as close to 30 percent of the selected applicants in the district did not confirm their child’s admission after the first lottery list this year.
Of the 5042 students who were selected in various schools in this first list of the Right to Education’s 25 percent quota this year, as many as 1471 didn’t even approach the school to claim their child’s seat, revealed the data provided by the district education department.
 
 After the selected list was announced on March 6, the parents of the applicants were given a week’s time till March 15 to confirm their admission at the schools which they were allotted to. This date was then pushed to March 18 keeping in mind the Holi celebrations in that period. Despite this, only 3444 applicants confirmed their admissions while 127 others were rejected on the basis of faulty documents. The remaining 1471 students will have to try again next year.
 
 Education officers here who asserted that the 100 percent online procedure has guaranteed transparency were baffled at the poor response. “This situation has left us baffled. The quota is reserved for children of the weaker section whose parents have been through the entire process from registration to getting through a lottery system. The very fact that they didn’t take the only step to their child’s happiness is absurd. When we received the complaint of harassment from around 24 schools by parents going to confirm this admission, we immediately took action and ensured that each of those students was given admission as deserved,” said Meena Yadav, district ZP education officer (primary
 
 “The new online system is very transparent and ensures that the parents are in the loop of the entire process. We have even put advertisements in the local newspapers as well as set up help desks for them. In addition to all this the parent of the child seeking admission is informed whether he is selected or not as well as the dates to visit the school for the admission via text messages,” she added.
 
 Some officials have speculated that some of the parents may be hoping that their wards may get a better school in the next list, and may have defaulted on this one to avail the other. “The applicants had to fill out as many preferences as they wanted at the time of enrolling. There is a possibility that some may have gotten admission in the school which is their second or third preferences and are hoping to get their first preference in the second lottery, which isn’t possible as the second lottery is for a completely different batch of applicants. These 1000 plus students will have to try again next year,” said a ZP official.
 
 Meanwhile, education activists here cry foul play on the part of the schools. “There are many schools in the district including Dombivali’s Vidya Niketan School, Badlapur’s Gurukul and Holy Writ Schools, etc, who were harassing parents by asking them for fees and wrongly telling them that they were not selected. We took around 150 such harassed parents and conducted a rally outside the collector’s office last week. While their issues were resolved, there must be many other illiterate poor parents who didn’t realise this trickery. Why would parents who have been through such a long process skip the last step t getting their children into good schools?” questioned Nitin Dhule, an education activist here.
 
 Of the total 8,407 RTE applicants in Thane district this year, as many as 5042, were selected in the first round of the lottery system, of which 3444 students have secured admissions in the schools of their choice.
 The next selection lottery round will be conducted on Monday March 27.
 
 
 
 According to the Government of India’s Right of Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, section 12 (1), 25 % of the strength of each entry level class in   board and government aided schools should be reserved for children belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged groups in the neighbourhood, and provide free and compulsory elementary education till its completion. This rule however doesn’t apply to unaided minority schools, madrasas, vedic pathshalas and education institutions primarily imparting religious instruction
