ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court on Wednesday granted   to Garima Bhushan and   Singh,   of Noida’s former engineer-in-chief  , in a Prevention of Corruption Act case.

 
 
 Garima and Karuna have been accused of floating a company to utilize the money illegally earned by Singh during his tenure in Noida. Allowing their applications for relief, a division bench of justices Ramesh Sinha and D K Singh directed them to be released on bail. The court, however, rejected the bail application of Yadav Singh’s son Sunny in the same case.
 
 The   registered criminal cases on July 30, 2015 and submitted a chargesheet against them. The case is being heard in the CBI court in Ghaziabad.
 
 Singh was engineer-in-chief of Noida Authority, Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority before raids conducted by the income tax department in November 2014 showed he owned property disproportionate to his known sources of income. He was suspended by the UP government in February 2015. The state also set up a one-member judicial commission to probe the charges against him.
 
 In July 2015, the high court directed the CBI to investigate the case, stating the allegations were very serious and the probe was complex. The state government went to the   against the high court order but the apex court refused to entertain its plea.
