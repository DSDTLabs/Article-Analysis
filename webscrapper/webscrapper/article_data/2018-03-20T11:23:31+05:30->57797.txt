CHENNAI: Madras high court has directed school education department to inspect every government, government aided and private school in the state for compliance of National Building Code, and to ensure safety of children from building violation and fire risk.

 The first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice Abdul Quddhose issued the interim directions in view of a Supreme Court directive given after the   school fire disaster of 2004. As per directions passed in the PIL moved by A Narayanan, the school education department is to form district level committees to carry out inspections and file a report by April 9.
 
 According to the petitioner, after the Kumbakonam school fire tragedy, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court, in which the court on April 13, 2009 gave several directions to all states and Union territories to ensure safety of school-going children. “In the said judgment, the apex court enumerated safety standards, in particular, fire and life safety and code of practices in educational institutions. Unfortunately, National Building Code of India, 2005 and the Supreme Court’s directions remain only on paper in Tamil Nadu. Several unrecognised schools, claiming to impart Samacheer, CBSE, ICSE syllabuses, were allowed to function without any statutory inspection. Many schools run by both government as well as private persons were functioning in dangerous conditions,” Narayanan said.
 
 He added that many of these schools neither have recognition from the school education department nor affiliation from CBSE. Such schools were existing in congested localities without proper lighting, ventilation and  . Many schools function on busy roads with heavy traffic, without a compound wall to ensure safety. Even godowns and commercial complexes have been converted into schools with impunity, on account of lack of periodic inspection, monitoring and punitive action by authorities, he said.
