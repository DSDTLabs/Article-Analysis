Actress   says she did not tell her father, veteran musician  , about her stint with singing in "Rules Don't Apply." 

 Lily, 27, plays a Hollywood wannabe in Warren Beatty's new movie and the actress did not tell her father about the song till the time it was out with the trailer, reported The Wrap.
 
 "I didn't tell him about the song until it was out in the trailer. I didn't share what it sounded like. I didn't give him any hints or anything. So I think that was kind of a surprise, which was fun," the actress said. 
 
 The actress admitted that she found the idea of singing the movie's title song live on camera "terrifying". 
 
 "Marla is a songwriter - not a singer - so I got to use the excuse of, well, if my voice cracks as Lily, or I'm nervous, Marla would have been. Like, it's totally fine," she said.
