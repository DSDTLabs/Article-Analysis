ALLAHABAD: At least 150 schools across the state, mostly situated in districts marked as ‘sensitive’, scored perfect zero as none of the students in these institutions cleared either class X or XII examinations conducted by   (UPSEB). Following it, board officials are mulling seeking explanation from them.

 
 The record shared by the board shows that 98 schools had 0% result in class X and 52 in class XII. These included government, aided as well as private schools. Secretary, UPSEB, Neena Srivastava told TOI, "This year strict measures were adopted by the state government to check copying. Apart from it, there is a possibility of only a dozen or so students appearing from such schools so we will decide on the fate of all such educational institutes when the board will reopen." The board is closed for three days after 
  .

In 11 schools, all examinees failed in class X while in six schools, all students of class XII couldn’t clear the examination.
