LUCKNOW: A youth was accused of raping an eight-year-old girl by luring her with chocolates in   on Monday night. The survivor was visiting her relative’s house for a family function and was playing outside with her cousin when the miscreant, identified as Bablu (25), allegedly approached her.

 He allegedly lured the girl to go along with him by promising to buy her chocolates. The youth then reportedly took her to a secluded place where he raped her and fled the scene, abandoning her there. 
 
 Meanwhile, the cousin informed her parents who went looking for the girl. When they failed to find her, her father called on ‘Dial 100’. By then the entire family had started looking for the child. They found the girl in a dishevelled state with blood stains on her frock. Itaunja police inspector Ashok Pandey sent the girl for medical examination. He said, “On the basis of identification by the cousin and some villagers, we traced Bablu, who was found lying in an inebriated state, and arrested him. He has been booked under   and Prevention of Children from sexual offences Act (POCSO).”
