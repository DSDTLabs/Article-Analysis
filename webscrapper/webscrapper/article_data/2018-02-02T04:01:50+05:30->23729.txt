NEW DELHI: The CPM has approached the   challenging the Centre’s decision to introduce electoral bonds and said the move “undermined democracy” and it would “lead to greater political corruption”. Claiming that the scheme would clean up political funding, the   government had announced electoral bonds in the previous budget. It met with stiff resistance from opposition parties and initial reservations from the Election Commission.

 
 CPM general secretary   said CPM was left with no choice but to move the  . “We took up the matter in Parliament and sought amendments to the bill when the government moved the proposal. Using their majority in LS, the government overturned the RS’s recommendations. The no disclosure clause in electoral bonds will create opacity in funding and is bad for democracy,” he said.
