CHANDIGARH: The   government has decided to constitute a board for registration of   and shelter homes running in the state. A proposal to that effect had been approved by chief minister  , said women and child development minister   on Friday.

 She said in order to keep children in orphanages and shelter homes being run by organisations and trusts, registration of such children was being ensured under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. “However, there was no registration procedure of shelter homes and orphanages giving shelter to women. Therefore, their registration and compliance of directions of the central government was not being ensured,” she said.
 
 Taking the issue seriously, Jain directed the department to prepare a proposal in this regard and send it for the approval of the CM. She said the state government would soon issue notification regarding constitution of the board.
