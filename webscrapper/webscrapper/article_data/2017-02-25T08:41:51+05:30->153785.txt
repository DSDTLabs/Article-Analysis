BATHINDA: Bathinda police on Friday dismissed head constables   for   a baptised Sikh in a police station and preparing a video clip of the act. 

 On February 8, the two cops had been placed under suspension along with Rampura Phool station house officer (SHO)  . The issue was 15 months old but came to light on February 7, after someone uploaded the video clip on Facebook. 
 
 Dharam Singh, a baptised Sikh Congress activist from Bhairupa village of Bathinda, was arrested on November 17, 2015 for protesting against rural development minister Sikander Singh Maluka over acts of sacrilege in Punjab. Congress workers had held a protest on February 7 and approached the Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) for action against cops who had stripped Dharma. 
 
 Bathinda SSP Swapan Sharma said, “Head constables Ram Singh and Harminder Singh have been dismissed from service for beating up a person and disrobing him in a police station. The SHO is already under suspension.”
