Surat: A 34-year-old woman killed her husband at Mankunia village of Vasda taluka in Navsari district on Thursday night. The woman was arrested after she admitted to having killed her husband.  Deceased Mangle Valvi, 35, lived with his family at Mankunia village of Vasda taluka. He had a small farm while his wife Meena used to work as a farm labourer to supplement the family income. The couple had three daughters aged 3, 5 and 9. The couple had a fight over money and food on Thursday night. Mangle then chose to sleep outside the house in the verandah. When he was fast asleep, Meena picked up an axe and struck him thrice on his neck, killing him on the spot. Police sub-inspector JV Chavda said the woman then went to her father-in-law’s house to tell him that Mangle was not getting up from bed. Mangle’s father Madhu Valvi rushed to his son’s house to find that he had been murdered. When police reached the house, Meena feigned ignorance but later broke down. She admitted to having killed Mangle and surrendered the axe too. Chavda said, “The family was facing financial problems. The couple used to quarrel daily over food and money. The man always demanded money from his wife as she was working but she used to refuse.” The two elder daughters of the couple are with their grandparents while the youngest is with the woman, who will be produced before a court soon by the police.
