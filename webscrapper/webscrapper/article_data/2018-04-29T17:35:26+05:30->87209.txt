KOLHAPUR: The dairy farmers from across   are going to distribute milk free of cost at district and taluka centres for seven days starting from May 3 in a protest against the state government's failure to intervene in the falling milk procurement prices said, Ajit Navale, farmer leader associated with   on Sunday. 

 The state government has set the minimum price at Rs 27 per litre for the milk dairies to procure milk from the farmers. Till last year the farmers used to get Rs 30 per as the dairies used to afford procuring the milk at that rate. However, now the rate at which the dairies are buying milk from the farmers has come down to Rs 19 per litre to Rs 22 per litre. 
 
 Navale said, "Against each litre of milk, the farmers are suffering loss of Rs 8 to Rs 10. The state government has set the procurement price at Rs 27 per litre, however the dairies are not paying the price to the farmers. It is the responsibility of the state government to intervene and resolve the issue and force the dairies to pay the minimum price assured."
