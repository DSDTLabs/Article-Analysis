BENGALURU: India's Davis Cup captain   reiterated 'singles first', following his team's epic comeback win over China.

 
 There are a couple of things to note in this Asia-Oceania Group One round two win that has earned India a spot in the   play-offs. Firstly, veteran   went past 84-year-old Italian Nicola Pietrangeli's record of most doubles wins, raising the bar to 43-13.
 
 The record is at home now, rest assured. Paes and Rohan Bopanna's rollercoaster victory on Saturday laid the foundation for 23-year-old Ramkumar Ramanathan and 28-year-old Prajnesh Gunneswaran to seal the win, which was achieved without the country's No.1 Yuki Bhambri. Bhupathi, 42, has sought to change the narrative since taking over as captain last year.
 
 "I have been working with a bunch of five-six singles players, looking at options," Bhupathi told TOI from Tianjin. "I don't pick a team depending on ranking, but on looking at the opposition."
 
 The non-playing captain keeps the calculation simple. "We need to win three matches to win a tie, one of them could be doubles. But four of the five matches are singles, that's where we need to get strong," Bhupathi said. With the success India has enjoyed over the last two decades, starting with   in the late 90s to Rohan Bopanna now, the focus has long been on doubles in the country. Bhupathi blamed that on Grand Slam presence. "We haven't had a sustained singles presence in Grand Slams," he said. "I'm looking forward to Yuki, Ramkumar and the rest changing that. Getting into main draws and winning a couple of rounds, keeping home interest alive."
