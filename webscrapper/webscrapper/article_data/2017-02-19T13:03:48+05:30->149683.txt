VARANASI: Annoyed over alleged indifference shown by major political parties, prominent seers and 'mahanths' (priests) here have vowed to support two   contesting Assembly polls from   and Varanasi Cantt seats. 

 The names of the two Independent candidates, Sunil Kumar Shukla from Varanasi Cantt and Satish Kumar Agrahari from Varanasi South, were announced after they took a pledge to "serve the people" on the bank of Ganga at Dashashwamedh Ghat on Saturday.
 
 The saints, associated with Akhil Bharatiya Ramrajya Parishad Nyas, took the decision of supporting the Independents claiming that "most political parties did not support them on the issue of police action against seers and devotees during idol immersion in October 2015".
 
 "The move is to give a message to the ruling party as well as other major political parties that there is nothing bigger than the self-pride of Kashi," said Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, a disciple of Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati. He added that as "political parties have nothing to do with the dignity of Kashi, the seers will support the two candidates in the assembly election".
 
 "It has been painful for us that the chief minister didn't even utter a word to comfort the devotees hurt in police lathi charge," he said, adding "such attitude clearly shows arrogance". 
 
 Many seers and devotees, including Avimukteshwaranand, were hurt in police action at Godowlia crossing. In July, senior SP leader and UP minister Azam Khan had gone to Sri Vidya Math to meet Avimukteshwaranand and also took lunch at the math. Azam had assured the seer that the government would provide legal assistance to pursue the matter of idol immersion in rivers, including Ganga, in court against the ban order. But, nothing has been done, said the seer wondering "how could one trust the politicians".
