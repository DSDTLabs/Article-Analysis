Vijayawada: The city police commissionerate, which is reeling under staff crunch, is now being stretched further as it has to supply   officers to Vijayawada international airport. 

 In January, the state government issued a gazette notification declaring the airport as an authorised immigration check post. 
 
 With no new recruitments for the police commissionerate being sanctioned since bifurcation, the decision to provide 55 immigration personnel puts pressure on the police unit. Principal secretary (Home) AR Anuradha too issued a GO (MS) 7 authorising the immigration check post. 
 
 Vijayawada airport director G Madhusudhan Rao said that they had spoken about the immigration services with the then DGP of the state, N Sambasiva Rao. 
 
 “Sambasiva Rao later sanctioned 55 members for the immigration checkpost. The first batch received the training, which includes etiquettes in dealing with passengers and all the arrangements are made on par with other major international airports like Shamshabad,” Rao said. Rao added that training for the remaining batches is expected to be over in the next couple of months. Soon, the immigration staff will get a specific dress code. 
 
 Deputy Commissioner of police (L&O I) Gajarao Bhupal was appointed as the civil authority of the check post. 
 
 By and large, most of the airports get their immigration staff from the centre as CISF personnel. 
 
 After the bifurcation of the state, the Gannavaram airport has been developed with Rs 150 crore. New passenger terminal building was constructed, and the existing old building was renovated for the international operations. 
 
 Airport officials said that the customs check will also be available soon. 
 
 Training has already been imparted to two teams in Hyderabad to facilitate customs check at the airport.
