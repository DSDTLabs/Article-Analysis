Ghaziabad: A 26-year-old tutor was arrested on Sunday night from   township for allegedly raping a minor student. 

 The father of the girl alleged that the tutor sexually exploited his daughter on the pretext of giving her coaching lessons and used to call her at odd hours, said police.
 
 Arjun Batra, the accused, ran his coaching classes, ‘Pathshala’ in  , a residential society in Crossings Republik, where he also lived in an independent flat.
 
 According to the girl’s family, the accused was in contact with the minor for the past seven-eight months. The age of the girl was not specified by police. “We received a complaint from the minor's father on Sunday morning that Batra called his daughter at odd hours and probably raped her,” said Prajyant Tyagi, chowki in-charge, Crossings Republik.
 
 “The minor’s father apparently caught the girl having a friendly conversation with the tutor via messages and asked us to arrest him,” added Tyagi. Before the accused was arrested, he was beaten by the minor's family and their relatives in his house, according to police. The accused was arrested under Section 375 (rape) of the IPC and under POCSO Act and has been sent to judicial custody. The girl submitted a written request against medical examination, a usual protocol in rape cases. Hence her medical test was not conducted.
 
  The accused was living in the society as a tenant for over two years and used to take individual tuitions initially. “After he gained popularity, he started teaching groups of students and had made it a full time profession. From what we know, the accused was in a relationship with the victim and had made objectionable video clips of the victim and was blackmailing her. The girl might have come under pressure and then revealed the matter to her parents,” said Niranjan Gupta, an RWA member.
 
 However, the police have denied the presence of any such video clip.
