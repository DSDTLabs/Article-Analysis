Tirunelveli: Camera traps will be installed at nearly 1,500 places along 750 paths for estimating the tiger population at the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KTMR). Field director (FD) of KMTR, N Venkatesh told TOI that the first of physical citing, taking pug marks, scratch marks and kill to identify tiger movement that began on January 27 concluded on Friday (February 2).

 “Installation of camera traps has already begun and will be carried out in three phases, covering around 250 paths in each phase. We have only 500 camera traps that can be used only in 250 paths at two cameras each per path to get a full view of the tigers for better accuracy,” he said and added that each phase would take about 35 days. Since it is a dense forest it will take 10 days for installation of the 500 camera traps for a phase, followed by recording images for the next 25 days. The feed from the camera traps will then be retrieved and the camera traps installed in the next 250 paths.
 
 The first phase of camera trap study will be conducted at Kalakkad Wildlife Sanctuary, followed by the second phase at Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve area and the last in the buffer zone of the tiger reserve in Kanyakumari Wildlife Sanctuary. Prior to commencement of the exercise, forest department officials said the population estimation exercise would be completed by March 31. “Because camera traps have to be installed at more places we expect the study to be completed by the end of April,” he said.
