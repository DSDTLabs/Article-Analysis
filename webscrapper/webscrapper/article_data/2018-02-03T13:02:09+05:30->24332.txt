Madurai: The Madras high court Madurai bench on Friday raised questions over the government’s proposed appointment of   as director of medical education (DME) and called for all files relating to the appointment of DMEs since 2014.

 The court’s observations came on a contempt case filed by the dean-cum-special officer of  , S Revwathy who has been fighting for her right to the promotional post of DME for two years. The additional advocate general told the division bench of justices   and R Tharani that the state’s health and family welfare department had prepared a panel of names for the appointment of the new DME, from which it had chosen Edwin Joe. 
 
 When the bench asked the reason for picking Joe, the AAG said that the department had taken into consideration various aspects of the contestants, among whom Joe had more “positive aspects”. At this, the bench asked whether the other contestants did not possess positive aspects. It also asked whether Joe did not have any “negative aspects.” .
 
 It then asked the government side, “Will you (government) do anything to appoint a person whom you want, and disturb others whom you don’t want?” adding, “If you are not able to do good to those people leave them, but don’t give trouble to them. The government shall produce all documents relating to appointment of DMEs from 2014 and the proposed appointment of Joe on February 7.”
 
 The post of DME had fallen vacant on December 28, 2015 after the then DME S   became vice-chancellor of Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University. As per the norms framed by the government, Revwathy should have been appointed as DME. 
 
 But the government appointed   dean R Vimala as DME on March 18, 2016 by relaxing the rule under the Special Rules for Tamiil Nadu Medical Service. Thereafter, it appointed Coimbatore government medical college dean Edwin Joe on April 25, 2017.
