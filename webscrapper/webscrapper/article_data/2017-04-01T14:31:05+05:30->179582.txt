Sharwanand's comic caper 'Radha', directed by debutante Chandra Mohan has been gaining quite a good pre-release buzz with its promotional content. 

 The movie, which has the actor donning the role of a witty cop is earlier scheduled to hit the screens on May 12. With big releases aimed across the summer season including that of Pawan Kalyan's 'Katamarayudu', 'Baahubali: The Conclusion' among others, the makers of 'Radha' are now in a fix over releasing the movie at the scheduled date and are reportedly looking into changing the release date.
 
 While on the other hand, Sreenu Vaitla's 'Mister' starring Varun Tej is gearing up for a theatrical release on April 13, the makers of 'Radha' are now looking for a safe zone slot to release the fresh date. The official announcement would be made very soon.
 
 The movie is produced by Bhogavalli Bapineedu and music is rendered by Radhan.
