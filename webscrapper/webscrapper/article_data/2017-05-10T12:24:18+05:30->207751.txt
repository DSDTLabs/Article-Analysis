PORVORIM: Excavation work for construction of the 15 MLD water treatment project at Porvorim has begun, public works department ( ) officials said.

 This project is expected to resolve the water shortage issues in Porvorim as well as in surrounding areas like Reis Magos and Nerul.
 
 Vijayanand Raut of the PWD said that, once completed, the Porvorim water treatment plant will reduce water scarcity issues faced in these thickly-populated areas.
 
 Water to Bardez taluka, including Porvorim, is being supplied from the Assonora plant, which also supplies water to parts of   area. The Assonora plant receives around 125 MLD (million litres per day) of raw water from the Tillari irrigation project, of which it treats and supplies around 100MLD to Bardez per day, yet there is a deficit of 15MLD between the water supplied to the taluka and its requirement.
 
 The area’s water requirement is expected to rise further as a high court complex is coming up at Porvorim, along with several residential and commercial projects which are underway in the area.
 
 Residents of Porvorim say that in most areas, water is supplied to them for only two hours a day during the summer, which is insufficient to meet their daily needs.
 
 PWD officials said that they do supply water for five to eight hours in some of the areas in Porvorim. “Water is supplied by tankers to any area where residents demand for it,” Raut said.
 
 A Porvorim resident, however, said that they had to resort to purchasing water from private tanker operators as they do not receive the PWD water supply most of the times even after requests are made to the department.
 
 Another 25 MLD project has been planned at   to meet the water requirement of Bardez taluka, but work on the project has not begun as the land acquisition process is still on.
