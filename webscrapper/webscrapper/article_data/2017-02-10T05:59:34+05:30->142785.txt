THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The price of milk sold under the Milma brand in the state is set to go up by Rs 4 a litre from Saturday.
A decision in this regard was taken at the director board meeting of the   (Milma) here on Thursday. The Milma had earlier obtained the approval of the state government for the price increase.
 
 Milma had last increased the prices of its milk and milk products in July, 2014. The high court had, a few years ago, ruled that Milma was free to fix the prices of its products.
 
 Justifying the hike, Milma chairman P T   said the steep rise in production cost and sharp decline in yield have compelled the cooperative federation to go for a price hike.Of the Rs 4 increase in price for different varieties of milk the cooperative brings to market under the brand name Milma, Rs 3.35 (87.75%) would go to milk farmers.   would get 16 paise each (4%) from the hike and 0.75% of the hike amount would go to the milk farmers' welfare board. The federation would set aside 14 paiselitre to meet its procurement, processing and packing expenses.
 
 “The cost of milk production has considerably increased in the last two years since the previous hike. But there has been no increase at all in the milk price. Such a situation has forced many farmers to withdraw from the field. Milk farmers had long been demanding an increase in milk price,“ said Kurup.
 
 Since there would be a delay in preparing milk packets with new prices, Milma would be using packets with old prices for a few more days, said Kurup.
 
 Milma authorities claimed that the price of milk they purchase from other states for sale in Kerala had increased in January itself. The availability of milk too has come down in other states. Milma brings to market five milk variants, prices of which would now range from Rs 39 per litre to Rs 44 from the existing price bracket of Rs 35 to Rs 39.
