A source says that the team is just back from Kashmir after canning some major portions there. 

 Talking about the song, director Vinod says, “The element of romance has been woven into this action-thriller. This song was shot in Pahalgam in Kashmir. The temperature was minus two degrees there during the shoot. We were camping in Kashmir for a month-long schedule last month. We waited for 20 days for the snowfall to shoot this song. It was actually worth the wait. We canned a major action block, too, in the first schedule. The climax portion was shot near Pakistan border.” 
 
 He went on to add that the crew had a really tough time dealing with the bone-chilling weather. Vinod adds, “We struggled a lot to cope up with the climate. Throughout the shoot, we found it hard to deal with the unpleasant weather. We even managed to shoot amidst avalanches. Both Sibi and Nikhila play VFX specialists in the film. Their romance witnesses an unexpected twist when they head to Kashmir.”
