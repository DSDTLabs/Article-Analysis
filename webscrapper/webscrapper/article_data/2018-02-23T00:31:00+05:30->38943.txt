If you’re planning to let your kids play at home this Sunday, confined to the four walls of your home, then don’t. Get them out; let them unwind in the open without getting hurt by speeding vehicles. It’s time to reclaim streets which are not just for motor vehicles. Thillai Nagar 10th Cross Street (West) will be the center of all excitement and fineness activities this Sunday. Make sure you are there.

 Times of India Happy Streets is Trichy’s precious opportunity to enjoy the city’s original charm, where families can spend part of their Sundays doing a workout, participating in leisure activities or simply socialising with others. This will also be the best day for bonding with one’s family members. So leave your cars and bikes behind and use your happy feet to get to the Times of India Happy Streets for a roller coaster of a morning!
 
 There was a time when children used to play on streets that were less noisy and congested. Happy Streets is an attempt to relive such moments, may be only for a few hours on every Sunday, where we wean off motorized transport, reduce congestion and pollution and provide sustainable mobility. Happy Streets is one place where you can play around, walk, cycle and pursue all that you wanted to but postponed owing to unavailability of space.
 
 An exciting mix of activities awaits you on Times of India Happy Streets, right from street football, workshop on diet exercise and nutrition and an open gym where you can participate in aerobics.
 
 Not only this, there is a lot more in store with activities that will make you nostalgic by allowing you to play something that you were fond of like marbles, tug of war, trampoline to name a few to revisit your childhood days. And there’s more to come. Performance by music bands, campaigns and workshop on traffic rules, and road safety demonstrations.
 
 The Times of India   is an initiative by Trichy City Municipal Corporation in association with the Trichy City police.
