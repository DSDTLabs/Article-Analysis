HYDERABAD: While acknowledging there are instances of misuse of the law to some extent, the   said due to substantial political pressure on police and revenue departments, many victims are forced to compromise with the accused before the chargesheet is filed which results in the case being disposed of at the police level itself.

 
 
  
  
 
 President of Telangana SC/ST Employees Association Medi   said instances of the Act being misused are exaggerated. “Whatever little extent that the law is misused is due to the ruling class and improper implementation. In many genuine cases, FIRs are delayed, and even if an FIR is registered, they are subsequently closed after a compromise is brought about under political pressure. They are then disposed without a chargesheet being filed. In some cases, the victims compromise on humanitarian grounds. Therefore, all these 40 per cent cases cannot be generalised as false cases,” Ramesh told TOI.
 
 He said, “In Hyderabad, most slum dwellers are SCs and the ST population in the city is very less. As a result, majority victims are from SC community. The interaction of SCs with the forward castes is resulting in more victimisation. There are several other Acts that are misused. The   ruling has to be reviewed.”
 
 Allaying apprehensions, city police said they are taking all steps to ensure that investigations are done as per legal procedures. “We have formed a special cell under   to review the SC/ST Atrocities Prevention Act cases. And in a time-bound action plan, a special drive is being undertaken to investigate cases based on evidence. By the end of the week, we will have another review on the progress of the cases. And finally, a third review will be conducted by me. We have also held consultations with   Collector   on the compensation to be given to the victims,” Hyderabad police commissioner   told TOI.
