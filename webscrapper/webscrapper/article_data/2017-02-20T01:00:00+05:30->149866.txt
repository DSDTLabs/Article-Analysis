Manisha Koirala, who will soon step into   Dutt’s shoes for the   biopic, is gearing up for the most special moment of her life. Towards the end of the year, the actress, after playing mother to   in the film, hopes to bring a bundle of joy into her life. Manisha’s plans to   a baby girl are afoot, and if all goes well, the little one will be in her mommy’s arms in the next 12 months.

 Manisha, who bravely battled cancer, tells us, “This December, it’ll be five years since I got completely cured. If everything goes well, I’m planning to adopt a baby girl. I just hope everything goes right and it all falls into place. I want to be there for the child, and I’ll make sure that I plan my life around this. I’m super excited about this new phase in my life, and I can’t wait for it to begin.”
 
 Manisha admits she’s begun to see life through a different prism. The actress, for the last two years, has expressed her desire to adopt, and her wish, it seems, will finally be answered. She adds, “I’ll pass on my wisdom and the lessons learnt out of life’s experiences to her. I’ll also teach her to appreciate the abundant beauty that lies in everything God has created.”
