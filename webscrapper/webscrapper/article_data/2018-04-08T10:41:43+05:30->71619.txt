 Contrary to the stipulations in the RTE Act, Kerala still consider Classes I to IV as  , Classes V to VII as upper primary and classes VIII to X as high school. More than anything else, the complex and all-pervading presence of aided school system in the state has forced the state government against making any structural changes in the system.
