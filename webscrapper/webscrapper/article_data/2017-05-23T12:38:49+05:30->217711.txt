 Pen drives, copy of hard disks and other electronic evidences seized from the apartment of Saibaba in Delhi by Gadchiroli police, which were produced as evidence before the Gadchiroli court, were also presented before the Ernakulam court by NIA. In one of the video-clips produced as evidence, Saibaba and Ajaykumar were found sitting together at a convention in Hyderabad.
