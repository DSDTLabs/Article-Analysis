Madurai: Seven recipients benefitted from the organs donated from a brain dead person at the Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC).

 On Friday, Thiagarajan, 57, of Athikulam in Madurai, who was working as a manager in a hotel in Battalagundu, was travelling on a two wheeler on the Battalagundu Bypass Road, when another two wheeler collided with his vehicle.
 
 He sustained severe injuries and was rushed to a private hospital in Madurai, where doctors declared him brain dead. As all his organs were in good condition, his family members, including his wife Manimekalai, were counselled by hospital counsellors on the importance of organ donation and his family agreed to donate his organs.
 
 The governmentâ€™s permission was obtained immediately and doctors performed a series of surgeries lasting for nearly five hours and the organs were harvested from the person. The liver and two kidneys were transplanted to patients of the MMHRC, the lungs were sent to Apollo Hospitals Chennai, heart to Chennai Fortis Hospital and the eyes were handed over to Aravind Eye Hospitals in Madurai.
