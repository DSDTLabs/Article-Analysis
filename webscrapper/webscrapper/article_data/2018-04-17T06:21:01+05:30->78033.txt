GURUGRAM: Around 650 National   Mission (NHM) workers went on   on Monday after the health department refused to renew contracts of four workers. 

 The strike was called off later in the day after the authorities renewed contracts of the three workers for three months. The health services took a hit as ambulance and junior staff remained unavailable.
 
 The four contract workers whose contracts were not renewed included staff Manita, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) Manoj and Amit and accountant Jyoti. Manita and Manoj were held guilty of medical negligence in February. Owing to this, a woman was forced to deliver at the hospital courtyard. Manoj, who had brought the woman and her husband to the hospital in an ambulance, dropped the woman on the hospital courtyard, instead of taking her to the emergency ward. Manita allegedly took the woman for ultrasound test, where she was denied the test for want of an Aadhaar card. Manita, according to sources, again left the woman unattended in the hospital courtyard where she delivered a baby.
 
 Amit, sources said, has been absent from duty while a complaint has been filed against Jyoti at the CM Window for not releasing an employeeâ€™s salary.
