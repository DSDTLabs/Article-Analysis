MUMBAI: A first time corporator and a new entrant to the BEST committee, Anil Kokil from Shiv Sena, raised eyebrows in political circles as Shiv   announced his nomination for the coveted chairman’s post on Tuesday. The elections will be conducted on Thursday. 

 Kokil, however, is not new to the BEST, as he comes with three decades of service in both transport and power supply divisions. 
 
  “I will take up issues related to employees’ welfare and at the same time, concentrate on the needs of commuters and power consumers,” Kokil said.
