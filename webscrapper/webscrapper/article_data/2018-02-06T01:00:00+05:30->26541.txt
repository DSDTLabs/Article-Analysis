I chose India over other countries because it’s secular and culturally diverse. I have been in Mumbai for over six months now and was in for a culture shock in the start – the teaching methods, accent of the folks here were difficult to cope with. However, I’m getting a hang of things here all thanks to my classmates who are extremely cooperative. 

 For my daily commute, I use the local trains. Travelling in Mumbai locals is an adventure of sorts. My friends and I call it the “push push train” as that’s what everyone does. My favourite food items here are frankies and chicken pulav. I love watching Bollywood movies – they are so full of emotions and entertaining. While I don’t understand Hindi much, ' ' from ' ' is my favourite Bollywood song.
