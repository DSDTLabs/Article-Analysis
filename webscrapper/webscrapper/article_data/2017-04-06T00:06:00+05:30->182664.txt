Indore: It’s that time of the year where industries have to depend on water tankers to meet production demands as water supply to industries in parts of   will completely stop from April 15.

 The areas will see a sharp reduction in daily supplies due to the depletion of water in Karam dam and Sanjay Jalashay.
 
 Companies that fail to shell out more to buy water from tankers will slash daily their production.
 
 Depending on the nature of the industry, companies have to spend about 3 to 10 times more than the usual water bill to buy water from tankers.
 
 According to Audhyogik Kendra Vikas Nigam (AKVN), water supply in sector 3 will last only until April 15 while others sectors such as 1 and 2 and SEZ will see reduced supply.
 
 PD Joshi, general manager at a battery manufacturer in sector 3 of Pithampur said, “Every summer we face severe water shortage and spend about Rs 1 lakh to purchase water.”
 
 The daily requirement at the battery manufacturer is about 1 lakh litres.
 
 According to industrialists, last year water supply to industries of Pithampur was stopped in early April. Water supply will remain poor from April to July.
 
 They said transportation of water through tankers becomes a costly affair in summers.
 
 The plight of export-oriented companies like pharmaceuticals, packaging firms, polyester packaging films and textiles become grim due to shortage of water supply hitting production.
 
 According to Pithampur Audhyogik Sangathan, AKVN supplies around 6 MLD water to Pithampur as against the required 18 MLD.
 
 Gautam Kothari, president, Pithampur Audhyogik Sangathan said, “Every year industries lose due to higher water costs. Many industries have to cut down production to keep the unit running. There is a high need to improve the basic infrastructure in the region.”
