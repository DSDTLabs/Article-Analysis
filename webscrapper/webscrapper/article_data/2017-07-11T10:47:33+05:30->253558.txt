LUCKNOW:  , the younger daughter-in-law of SP patriarch  , has refuted media reports published and telecast on July 2 that it was her NGO that received a majority of grants given by the Gau Seva Ayog during Akhilesh Yadav’s tenure as the chief minister. 

 In a press release issued by her team on Monday, she says: “I take a strong objection to both print and electronic media reports for casting aspersions against me and my husband....While we have nothing to do with the Jeev Asharay, an NGO engaged by the   to look after the distraught animals brought to its Shelter Home, known as the Kanha Upvan, our names are being dragged unnecessarily into the controversy over the NGO funding.”
 
 “We have no relation, whatsoever, with the NGO, Jeev   Goashala, Lucknow. We are not even a member of Jeev Ashray Goashala. I strongly condemn association of our names with Jeev Ashray Goashala in getting the financial aid disbursed by the State Government,” the press note quoting Aparna, the wife of Mulayam’s younger son Prateek Yadav, says.
 
 However, she goes on to add: “I do accept, being an animal lover, I have visited Jeev Ashray Goashala several times alone and also with family, friends and well-wishers. But this does not mean that we become the owner of the Kanha Upvan.”
 
 “I am also deeply saddened by the news item quoting the animal husbandry minister, who too has ascribed my name with Jeev Ashray and announced to hold inquiry against me without verifying the facts,” she says.
