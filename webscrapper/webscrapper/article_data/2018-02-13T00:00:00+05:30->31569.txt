For the past few years, all the music that   has produced has been directed at one cause — to build environment consciousness and bring focus on climate change, with key focus on India. His upcoming concert in the city later this month, which features   awardees from across the world, is to raise awareness on environmental issues. It is little wonder then that he features on the Real Leaders 100 list of leaders who ‘Inspire the Future’, alongside  ,   and  . Ricky is the only person from India to make it to the list.

 Although Ricky is humbled to see his name in the list, he says that it is an added responsibility. “For the last couple of years, I have dedicated my life and music to creating environmental consciousness; that’s the only music I make. After receiving this honour, I will continue to do whatever I am doing, but more vociferously and with a little more encouragement. Any recognition is a platform for doing more work and it helps open more doors. It also gives me a good pat on the back for the choices I have been making. So, it feels good and daunting at the same time,” says Ricky.
 
 To make people eco conscious is to change their behaviour. So, how does Ricky think that music can drive this change? “Music is a powerful language, not just for communication, but to retain a message deep into one’s consciousness. Music is an emotional way to put across a message, which is why a song is more powerful that giving a thousand speeches. People across the world are constantly failed by leaders and politicians. When it comes to polices, people follow them with minimum commitment, just because they have to follow a law. But when you use an emotional language and get into someone’s conscious, they tend to follow the message and teach it to their kids as well. It’s up to artistes and musicians to make a difference,” he signs off.
