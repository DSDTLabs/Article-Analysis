MAPUSA: With elections to 186 panchayats in Goa just a month away, members of a few local bodies in   and Pernem seek the ouster of their respective heads and deputies. 

 Though they cite reasons such as no consultation on developmental works, the actual undercurrent is different. These members were assured of a smooth ride during the panchayat polls by the newly-elected MLAs on the condition that if they garner support for them at the grassroots level, they will ensure power to them.
 
 Now, it’s payback time. With tacit support of these elected representatives, most of the panchayat members are at work to unsettle the current dispensation. Among the panchayats that have seen no-trust motions include Agarwada, Chandel-Hasapur, Tuem, Assagao and  . 
 
 In the seven-member Agarwada panchayat, four members moved a motion against sarpanch, Shashikala Dhamaji and her deputy,   Shetye. In Chandel-Hansapur, sarpanch   and her deputy, Sudhir Malik met a similar motion. 
 
 In Tuem panchayat, five out of the seven panchas raised a banner of revolt against sarpanch, Prajakta Kannaik. Similar was the fate of Assagao and Sirsaim panchayat chiefs.
 
 Panchayat and assembly elections are fought on party lines in Goa, but people don’t consider party affiliations while casting their vote during the panchayat polls. Analysts believe that most of the panchayat members worked against the sitting MLAs during the 2017 assembly elections in these talukas, due to which they had to bite the dust. 
 
 The ensuing panchayat elections will be a testing time for the ousted BJP ministers as a defeat of their chosen candidates would further weaken their position in the constituency, and their own future prospects, too. Post the recent assembly polls, many panch members deserted the BJP MLAs and forged alliance with the new MLAs.
 
 Though the defeated BJP MLAs are mantaining a distance from the panch members who worked against them, their only hope is that their party is in power.
