 On her role, Reba tells us, “I play Tina who grew up in an island. My character is shown as someone tolerant to the problems that exists in such a place. Though she is brought up in a naadan way, she is neither completely traditional nor modern.”
 
 Talking about the romantic angle in the movie, she says, “It is not a clichéd romance but a cute love story. I will be playing an equally prominent role as that of Neeraj.
