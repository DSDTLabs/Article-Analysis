Lambi (Muktsar): A two-minute audio conversation between Punjab chief minister   and a farmer from Lambi in which the SAD veteran is making desperate attempt to control dissidence has gone viral on social media. The audio has triggered sharp reactions from both Congress and   (AAP), which said the ruling Badal clan was resorting to begging to persuade voters.

 “This shows the list of crimes they have done in the past 10 years and the hurt they have caused to Sikh sentiments. Nobody will forgive them for sacrilege, farmers’ suicides and drug deaths. If the CM is unable to save his own seat, then SAD will lose all seats in Punjab,” claimed AAP spokesperson Sanjay Singh.
 
 In the audio, CM’s aide can be heard asking farmer Gurdeep Singh to speak to Badal and stifle the dissidence to boost the party’s prospects. When the chief minister comes on the call, he tells Gurdeep, “Meri madad karni, hun meri izzat da sawaal hai (It’s a matter of pride for me, you have to help me).”
 
 Unconvinced, Gurdeep retorts, “Uncle ji oh ta theek hai, but your local leaders like Mindoo Khera have made things very bad here.” Badal again pleads, “If you have called me uncle, then you have to support me. No ifs and buts. Let’s forget the past.” 
 
 However, SAD said that the CM was not committing any crime in making a call to his supporter. “It’s just a routine call to ask a supporter to stay with us. What’s the big deal in this,” asked SAD spokesperson Manjinder Sirsa. On the other hand, Congress chief Capt Amarinder said the move was a desperate attempt by Badal to seek forgiveness.
