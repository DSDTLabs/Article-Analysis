Surat: The world’s largest diamond cutting and polishing centre in Surat will be observing one-and-a-half month-long Diwali vacation from October 15. 

 Few days ago, Surat Diamond Association (SDA) announced that the industry will be shut for a month ahead of Diwali festival starting from October 15 to November 15. However, many small and medium unit owners are planning to extend the vacation for one-and-a-half month. 
 
 The Goods and Services Tax has cast a dark shadow on the business of small and medium diamond manufacturers, traders and merchants. Many small manufacturers running 15 emery wheel units have stopped manufacturing of diamonds fearing blockage of capital investment with 3 per cent GST payment and 0.25 per cent GST in rough diamonds. 
 
 Most of the diamond units will start shutting down in Varachha, Mahidharpura and Katargam before October 15. 
 
 “The situation is grim in the market. I have seen many small people who do job work without work since the past two months. Our profit margins have shrunk to an extent that we are unable to sell our goods. Small manufacturers are the worst hit as they do not get raw material on credit due to GST,” SDA president Babu Gujarati said.
 
 A small unit owner in Varachha Mahesh Savaliya said, “As Diwali nears, I am just thinking how am I going to pay bonus to my workers. I have not been able to sell a single diamond in the last one month. The 3 per cent GST on diamonds is quite high and small merchants are not willing to pay. However, this time around I will keep the unit closed till the end of November.”
 
 Another diamond company owner Rajesh Shah said, “The orders for Christmas season have plummeted by almost 30 per cent this time. GST has increased the prices of polished diamonds, but there is no realization of profit. The buyers are asking for huge discounts which is not possible in this scenario.”
