VISAKHAPATNAM: After a wait of over three years since demolition of the old court building, the foundation stone laying ceremony (bhoomi puja) for the new court complex took place on Sunday at the district court premises. The Rs 30-crore court complex would house different courts in four floors besides two floors allotted for parking.

 On Sunday morning, principal district judge PV   laid the foundation stone for the new court complex while building contractor AV   performed the bhoomi puja.

 On the occasion, justice Jyothirmayee said, “In the district court complex, there are 44 courts. Some of the courts would be shifted to the new building once it’s constructed.”
