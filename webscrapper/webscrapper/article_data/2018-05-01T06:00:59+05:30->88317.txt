CHENNAI: Even if caste emerges as a contributing factor for a murder, the offence cannot be termed as 'honour killing', the Madras high court's Madurai bench observed on Monday. A division bench of   T   made the observation while commuting death sentence awarded by a trial court to a man accused of one such crime. 

 In May 2014,   and  's daughter eloped with one Viswanathan. Aggrieved, the couple, in May 2016 picked up a quarrel with  's sister and murdered her. Terming the murder as an act of 'honour killing', a trial court convicted the duo and awarded death penalty to the husband.
 
 Deciding the appeal, the bench said: "Though element of caste is involved to a certain degree, evidence falls short of terming this case to be one of honour killing. Though it could be said that the caste of the accused and deceased may be a contributing factor in the perpetration of the crime, the same cannot be termed as a murder to save honour. What had taken place outside the house of the deceased before the accused inflicted the fatal injuries is not known. It could have been the inability to secure his daughter back, that resulted in the killing due to mental strain and heat of the situation. Therefore, this case falls short of being termed as 'honour killing'."
 
 The bench commuted Shankaranarayanan's death sentence awarded to life term and acquitted Chellammal.
