 The theme of the installations was rivers of the world. Manav said, “This is unique because it’s a travelling museum. These installations will travel from one place to another, culminating at an actual museum. The idea behind a travelling museum is making it accessible to maximum people.”

  The project was unveiled by the artist along with senior officials from the mall in the presence of art lovers from NCR. Pushpa Bector, head – premium malls, DLF, said, “There hasn’t been a great history of public art projects in the NCR, but of late that has changed, which is a welcome sign. What I particularly liked about this one is that it is in a modern mall, a place where you wouldn’t expect an art installation. We are trying to make art accessible to everyone.” The installations will be displayed in the mall till February 18, and the launch will be followed by weekend events like morning meditations, as well as dance and music collaborations.
