Trichy: A mentally ill rape victim in Trichy received a solatium of Rs 2 lakh from the state government on Thursday for the maintenance of her girl child. The man who was charged with raping her had cleared a DNA test in this regard and was acquitted for lack of evidence last year.

 The 30-year-old woman from Avarampatti village near Manapparai was handed over the cheque by the special public prosecutor, G Krishnaveni Thamaraiselvan, on the integrated district court campus in the presence of her family members. The solatium, which came as a mild relief to the poverty-stricken woman, was ordered by the mahila court here on August 31 last year.
 
 According to the case, the woman used to graze goats on the farm lands of a resident of the village. However, though she was unmarried she became pregnant. When quizzed by her family, she told them that the owner of the farm had raped her several times from November 9, 2014 on the promise of marrying her. The woman later gave birth to the baby. Subsequently, the All woman police station, Manapparai registered a case under sections 376 and 417 of IPC. The court ordered the man to undergo DNA test to confirm whether he was the biological father of the child born to the woman. However, the DNA test did not point fingers at the man. After considering the arguments of the counsels of both the parties, the court acquitted him in 2017.
 
 Even though the court freed the man, it observed that the woman was a victim of rape by someone else. The police were unable to identify the culprit so far. On their part, the police cited the “mental instability” of the woman as the obstacle before them to find the accused. The court observed that considering the mental health condition of the woman and the future of the girl born to her, the district administration and the district legal services authority must take steps to help the victim get solatium from the state government. The government has now handed over the relief.
