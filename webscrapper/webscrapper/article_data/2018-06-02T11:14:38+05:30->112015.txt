RAIPUR: A nurse, her husband and two children were found hacked to death at home in village in Mahasamund on Thursday, sending shockwaves across the district.

 The killers struck when there was a power cut in the area. Villagers heard blood-curdling screams, but assumed that it was a woman in labour at the health centre. As daylight broke, they were stunned to see the blood-smeared bodies of Yogamaya Sahu, 30, husband Chetan, 32, and their two children, aged 8 and 6.
 
 Yogamaya was an auxiliary nurse-midwifery and Chetan had started his own business after working as a medical sales executive in Raipur. They lived in a house within the government health centre compound. Police believe it is an inside job, and seeing the brutality of the killings, they feel it was murder for vengeance. 
 
 Police have found that the family was targeted a few weeks ago, when some unidentified persons vandalized their new car parked at home. The Sahus installed two CCTV cameras after that, but police did not find any footage of Wednesday-Thursday as there was a power failure in the area. 
 
 After strong winds and rainfall on Thursday evening, the Pithora region suffered an all-night power failure. Due to the heat, most people slept outdoors or kept their main doors open for ventilation. The Sahus did the same.
 
 They kept their main door open and slept in the open courtyard of their quarters. In the darkness, the killers sneaked in and stabbed and hacked the sleeping family. Neighbours told police that they heard the screams but thought a woman was giving birth at the health centre. It was the maid who first came upon the grisly crime scene and raised the alarm. 
 
 Police suspect the involvement of some known persons. The killers tried to break open wardrobes and opened boxes but nothing was found stolen.
