IMPHAL/MUMBAI: A two-member police team from Manipur reached Mumbai late Tuesday to take   back home. 

 Singh, 65, had been missing for 40 years until he was traced to the streets of Bandra recently. The Bandra police then put him up at an   in Virar.
 
 The team from Manipur's Patsoi police station are likely to fly back home with Singh on Wednesday.
 
 Meanwhile, back at his ancestral home, Singh's family members have made all arrangements and even set up a separate room for him.
 
 Hailing from Khumbong Mamang Leikai in   West, Singh left home in 1978. His family had given up all hope until a YouTube video showing Singh singing an old Hindi song on the streets of Mumbai was brought to their attention on Saturday. The video was uploaded on October 17 last year by Bollywood designer Firoze Sakir.
 
 Atom Samarendra, secretary of   (Khumbong), who played a pivotal role in tracing the senior citizen, said Singh's family, other locals and his childhood friends are anxiously waiting for his return.
 
 "We are planning a simple homecoming function for him at our local ground. His family members, relatives, childhood friends and locals will go Imphal airport to welcome him," Samarendra said.
