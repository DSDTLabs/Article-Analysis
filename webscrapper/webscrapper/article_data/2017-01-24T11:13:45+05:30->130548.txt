BHUBANESWAR: A   carrying at least 65   from   skidded near a steep curve while descending from Dhauli hill and turned turtle, leaving 45   on Tuesday. So far, no loss of life was reported.

 "Total 45 injured  , including five children and 15 women, were rushed to   here. Doctors referred six of the injured to SCB medical college and a hospital in Cuttack after their condition worsened," said Khurda district collector Niranjan Sahoo said. 
 
 Tourism minister Ashok Panda said the accident occurred after the driver lost control while negotiating the sharp turn.
 
 A helpline number 0674-2391983 has been announced by the Capital Hospital.
 
 Bus accident survivors blamed the driver for reckless driving. “Since the bus was descending from the hill, the driver should have been careful. We would have died had the bus plunged from a bigger height. Luckily the bus rammed into a dry waterbody after skidding off the road at the bottom of the hill,” said Bijan Dey, an injured tourist.
 
 Locals vented their ire on state government for poor road safety measures at the famous tourist destination. “We have been witnessing accidents frequently. The government has been unsuccessfully promising to widen the road. The authorities should have installed signage boards, warning drivers from other states to drive carefully,” said Jayant Sahoo, a local resident.
 
 In 2012, a packed tourist bus plunged off the Dhauli hill on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar on Tuesday, killing four and injuring around thirty tourists from West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.
 
 On October 14, 2014, a software engineer died and 40 others were wounded when a bus skidded off the hill and fell into a gorge. On May 23, 2016 a bus driver escaped by a whisker after he rammed the empty vehicle into a roadside concrete fence atop Dhauli hill. Luckily, the bus got stuck in trees in a nosedive position.
