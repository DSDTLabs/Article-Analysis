PUNE: As part of its transparency agenda, the   ( ) has opened the doors of the standing committee meetings to the public. However, citizens have not shown much interest in attending the meetings at which crucial financial decisions are taken. 

 Following municipal elections, citizens’ groups had demanded that the BJP fulfil its promise of a transparent administration and allow media and citizens to attend the meetings. The general body meetings are open to everyone, but standing committee meetings were held behind closed doors. BJP opened the doors of the standing committee meetings in March, but civic officials said not a single person has attended the meetings so far, except a few reporters.
 
 Standing committee chairman   said, “We have taken all efforts to bring in transparency. Most information is easily available for public scrutiny, so the need to attend meetings may not have arisen.”
 
 Activists, however, blamed the poor publicity given to the initiative. “People aren’t aware of the move. Adequate publicity should have been ensured,” said   of Sajag Nagrik Manch.
