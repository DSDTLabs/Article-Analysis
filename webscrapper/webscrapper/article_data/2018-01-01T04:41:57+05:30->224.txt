 The person at the rear got off and shot at Mahlawat using a pistol he was carrying. The bullet broke the SUV’s glass but did not hit Mahlawat directly, only grazing his back. He sustained minor injuries. 
 
 As the men fled, Mahlwat drove himself to   and was sent home after first aid. Police said that the attack was carried out by young men, who had not covered their faces at the time of the attack.
 
 The entire incident was recorded using the security footage of the CCTV camera of the petrol pump, which has been handed over to the police officials.
