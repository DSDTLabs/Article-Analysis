AHMEDABAD: The   ( ) on Friday opposed the discharge applications filed by two accused cops in the 2004 Ishrat Jahan encounter case, retired DIG D G Vanzara and retired SP, N K Amin. 

 The investigating agency has denied all claims of innocence on basis of which Vanzara and Amin sought discharge from the case.
 
 According to CBI counsel R C Kodekar, Vanzara and Amin's involvement in the criminal conspiracy is duly established in the evidence that the CBI has placed in the chargesheet filed in 2013. Witness statements recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC before judicial magistrates reveal the fact that Ishrat and three other persons killed in the police encounter were illegally detained by cops at the behest of the accused.
 
 Statements made by the CBI in reply to the discharge applications highlighted the evidence from the chargesheet that the victims were in illegal custody of the accused and were kept at Arham Farm. They were even interrogated by both the accused cops before they were killed on June 15, 2004.
 
 The CBI also highlighted that there was a plan to kill Ishrat and three others before registration of the FIR, and it cited statements of witnesses showing that the   was prepared much before the encounter.
 
 After CBI filed its reply refuting Vanzara and Amin's claims that they were falsely implicated and that there is no evidence against them, special CBI judge J K Pandya posted further proceedings on the discharge applications on May 5.
 
 Meanwhile, former DGP P P Pandey was discharged from the case by the CBI court in February for want of evidence against him as well as for the absence of prosecution sanction. Vanzara and Amin have also contended that there is no sanction obtained by the CBI to   them.
