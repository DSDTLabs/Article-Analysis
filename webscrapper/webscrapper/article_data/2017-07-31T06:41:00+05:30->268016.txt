MADURAI: Late President A P J Abdul Kalam’s grandnephew A P J M Sheik Saleem sought to end a controversy regarding the Bhagavad Gita placed by Kalam’s statue at his memorial at Peikarumbu in   by placing the Quran and Bible beside the statue on Sunday.

 Abdul Kalam’s memorial was inaugurated by PM   on July 27 to celebrate his life, including his cultural interests. 
 
 One of the statues that had been kept under covers till the PM Modi unveiled it, depicts the former president playing the veena, with a sculpted ‘Bhagavad Gita’ on a bookrest beside him.
 
 On Saturday, MDMK leader Vaiko asked if the Bhagawat Gita was placed beside the statue “with an ulterior motive”, and if the Modi government thought that there was no one to question it. “Is the Gita above the Thirukkural, the only book which is qualified to be placed in the memorial?” he said.

 Thirumavalavan also said that it was the Thirukkural (a classic Tamil Sangam literature example) that should have adorned the memorial.
 
 Meanwhile, Kalam’s relatives Sheik Dawood and Salim told PTI on Sunday, “An unnecessary controversy was raised by some people. 
 
  officials had not sculpted the Bhagavad Gita near the statue with any (ill) intention.” They said they would also place a copy of Tamil treatise Thirukkural near the statue soon.
 
 They said Kalam was a leader to all Indians and no one should seek to politicise the issue.
