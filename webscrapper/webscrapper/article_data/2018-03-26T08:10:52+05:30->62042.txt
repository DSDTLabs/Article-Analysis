HYDERABAD: Cyberstalking is on the rise in the city, with an increasing number of cases being reported, and   filing an average of five cases of cyberstalking and social media harassment every month.

 Last year, Rachakonda recorded over 52 cases of cyberstalking and social media harassment. This year, they received 10 such cases so far.
 
 According to the   police, 80% of the cyberstalking offenders are known to the victim and start harassing the woman victim with an intention of revenge.
 
 "There have been cases, where the offender had blackmailed the female victim, after obtaining their pictures from social media.
 
 In most cases of cyber harassment and  , the offender tries to take revenge after the victim refuses to accept their proposal, or it is a case of revenge after a breakup," he added.
 
 Nearly 20% of the victims are minors, who are primarily school going girls. Most of the time, the victims are worried that their parents will not allow them to use social media or slap restrictions if they find out about the case.
 
 Though police receive verbal petitions frequently, hardly 25% of the victims choose to file an FIR. This year, police have planned to make women victims aware of the law and cybercrime. Police have been conducting awareness programmes on colleges and schools.
 
 "Most of the victims are unaware of the law or what are the various kinds of cybercrime. Today everyone is using a smartphone and internet, however, not many people are aware of the law or crimes related that. We are educating the women in schools and colleges along with She Team to come forward and file FIR. We are also trying to teach them how to use social media in a safer way," said the official.
