Brazilian football legend   is still breaking new ground and playing the field. According to reports from  , the retired star is to marry two women at the same time and will tie the knot in August with his pair of fiancees,   and  . 

 The two women have been living “harmoniously” with the former Barcelona star since December at his £5 million Rio de Janeiro mansion, according to reports. 
 
 They both get exactly the same presents at the exact same time, apart from an identical “allowance” of £1,500 from the footballer which they can spend as they want. Reports say Ronaldinho, 38, recently bought them the same perfume during a trip abroad together. 
 
 The star’s sister, Deisi, however, is against her brother’s polygamy and has been quoted in the Brazilian media as saying she won't be attending. However, there is no dearth of well-wishers. 
 
 Brazilian singer Jorge Vercillo, who is Ronaldinho’s neighbour, has confirmed his presence, as have many other celebrities. Ronaldinho started dating Beatriz in 2016 but also carried on his older relationship with Priscilla. 
 
 He will marry the two women at a private ceremony inside the   condominium, in the posh Barra da Tijuca district in Rio where he has lived since 2015, according to Brazil's O’Dia newspaper. “During the Rio carnival this year, Ronaldinho hired a VIP box in the sambadrome to watch the processions and took both women,” the newspaper reported.
