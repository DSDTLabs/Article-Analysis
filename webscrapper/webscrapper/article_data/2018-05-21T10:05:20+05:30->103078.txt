 Kamboj had started his political career by joining the BSP and was made the state president by party founder Kanshi Ram. He was still the BSP state president when he switched over to Congress.
 
 When he left the Congress for the AAP in November 2015, Col Kamboj had said the Congress had failed to emerge as an alternative to the SAD. He had said that the AAP was the only hope for the people of Punjab.
