MATHURA: In a heart-wrenching incident, 34-year-old Vimla Singh had to carry her disabled husband Badan Singh on her shoulder for over 15km for several weeks to obtain a disability certificate from the CMO’s office in Mathura.

 Since she did not have the money to hire an auto or a taxi, she walked from her house in Geeta Vihar colony to the CMO’s office and back. Earlier, an NGO had refused to give her husband a tricycle as his “one leg was working”.

 The couple had approached the government to get a free wheelchair under a state-run scheme and required a disability certificate for that. To the get the certificate the couple had been making rounds of the health centre in Mathura for the past several weeks.
 
 Badan Singh told TOI that they had first visited the CMO's office three weeks ago and he was told that disability certificates are issued only on Mondays. "We went there again on last Monday and were told that my photograph is required, so we had to again return", he said adding that he finally got the certificate this week on Monday.
 
 Additional Chief Medical Officer, Mathura, Dr Rajiv Gupta said that Badan Singh had been provided the certificate of 70 percent disability but he was not aware of his case. He admitted that disability certificates are issued once in a week on Monday and a photograph is required for the form.
 
 He said the department would have surely helped them, if they had approached any senior officials and explained their plight. He said under the government's welfare scheme a disability certificate is mandatory to receive the free wheelchair.
