PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The municipality-run   (YCMH) in Pimpri is hoping to get a medical college and research centre soon. 

 BJPâ€™s Chinchwad MLA Laxman Jagtap and Bhosari MLA Mahesh Landge met medical education minister   in Mumbai on Monday urging him to grant a no-objection (exemption) certificate and grant concession in fees to the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation-run YCMH. 
 
 Mahajan said he was positive about granting the exemption certificate.
 
 During his municipal election campaign in Chinchwad, chief minister   had announced that YCMH would soon get a medical college and research centre. YCMH was started 25 years ago, but several medical posts since the last five years are lying vacant. Both MLAs have also requested the minister for a permanent solution in this regard.
 
 Earlier, the state government had appointed PCMC medical officer of health K Anil Roy, officer on special duty for completing formalities of the medical college. A few days ago, he sent a letter to the state government to get the exemption certificate. 
 
 Earlier, the civic body had obtained permits and approvals to start the medical college. However, it failed to kick off due to the lack of the certificate.
 
 YCMH is the largest multi-speciality hospital run by the civic body in the municipal limits. It has a 650 bed capacity. However, the staff-patient ratio is less. There is a shortage of doctors too.
