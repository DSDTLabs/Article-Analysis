BHOPAL: It is a catch-22 situation for the patients vising the hospital run by the Madhya Pradesh  . Drawn in by the low consultation rates, they get a shocker when they have to pay exorbitant prices for medicines at the hospital’s pharmacy.

 Waiting in line for hours just to see the doctor seems like the easiest part for them. Unregulated consultants prescribe low branded medicines, and the pharmacy refuses to provide the generic low-cost option of the drug — contradicting the government norms.
 
 “We will only dispense the medicines prescribed by the doctors. If you have any issue, take it up with the doctor,” said a representative of the private medical store at the   hospital.
 
 The store runs 24*7 and is always teeming with patients. “A generic option must be provided by the drug store. I am not aware of the violations. We would investigate the matter,” said Red Cross hospital superintendent, Dr S C Sharma.
 
 Bypassing rules, some consultants, when unavailable, also invite patients to their private clinics, where the patients have to pay the regular — and expensive — fee. 
 
 The hospital has also faced flak for leasing out spaces for other private ventures in the past. Governor Anandiben Patel — who is also the chairman of the MP Red Cross Society — visited the hospital on Wednesday. 
 
 The governor inspected the hospital blood bank, pathology and other services. 
 
 Elections for Red Cross have not been held for over three years. The last body was dissolved in April 2015.
