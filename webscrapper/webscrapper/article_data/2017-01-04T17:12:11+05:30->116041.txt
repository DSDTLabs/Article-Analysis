Don’t you just hate it when one of your nail breaks? It can happen suddenly when you just snag your nail. And, the only solution left is to cut all your nails! Well, the next time your nail breaks, just use a tea bag to fix your  . Wondering how?
 
 
 
 
 
 Here’s what you need to do:
 
 1. If you’re wearing any nail polish, take off the polish from that broken nail.
 
 2. Now, cut a tiny piece (as per the width of your nail) from a tea bag. For this hack, you would need the paper tea bags and not the fabric ones.
 
 3. Start by applying a clear base coat on that nail and place the tea-bag piece on the broken nail. It should cover half your nail.
 
 4. Once dry, apply another base coat on this—making the paper look translucent. Now, you can easily apply the nail polish on this fixed nail.
