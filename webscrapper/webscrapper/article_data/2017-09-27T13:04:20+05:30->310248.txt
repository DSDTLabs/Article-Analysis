COIMBATORE: A group of youngsters have conducted a snap survey of city roads for potholes and submitted photos of nearly 500 such roads to the corporation commissioner,  , seeking steps to repair them.

  member   said the survey was on for the past one month. “We have a team of volunteers and we wanted to do something about the bad condition of the city roads. So, we decided to visit as many streets as possible and click pictures of the potholes. Then, we documented it and submitted it to the corporation commissioner,”   said.
 
 One of the volunteers said they had contacted a junior engineer attached to the civic body to repair   road. “But, the engineer said he could not undertake any patch work as the northeast rainfall was due in October. We told him that he can’t put the commuters’ life at risk,” the volunteer said.
 
 The corporation commissioner has, however, assured them to take up the patch work soon. “The corporation officials said they were waiting for funds from the state government,” Ashok said.
 
 City engineer Parvathy, meanwhile, told TOI that they were carrying out a survey of bad roads and would prepare an estimate soon. “We have started filling up several potholes using construction debris. In some locations, we are also taking up patch work,” she said.
 
 The youngsters have also made a video and shared it on social media to make it a mass movement. “The corporation spends most of its funds on laying roads, but there is no quality checking. They do not have a quality control team and erring contractors are not penalized. Unless the corporation takes steps to curb corruption in awarding road contracts, quality roads will remain a distant dream,” Ashok added.
