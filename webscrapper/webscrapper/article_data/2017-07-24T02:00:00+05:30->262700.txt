PATNA: With   around the corner, the makeshift stalls at   market in   area in the city are luring customers with varieties of rakhis with devotional songs playing in the background. 

 “We start selling rakhis a month before Rakhshabandhan and 100 to 150 customers purchase rakhis here every day. This place will be jam-packed ten days before Rakhabandhan,” said Ankit Kumar, who otherwise sells women accessories. Like Ankit, other shopkeepers are also busy selling rakhis.
 
 “You get the best rakhi here and that too at a minimum price. This is the reason why large number of buyers throng this place,” said another shopkeeper Abhishek Kumar, adding, “Once the Rakshasbandan is over, many shopowners will shut their shops for ten days and relax.”
 
 Rakhis are available from Rs10 to Rs100 here. This time, rakhis with stones or coins have hit the market. Apart from them, rakhis with swastik mark, Om and peacock are also available and people are looking for rakhis painted in silver colour so that they look like silver. “Still, a large number of buyers go for traditional rakhis made of silk thread and a few beads embedded in them,” added Abhishek. Rakhi, along with roli, chandan and tray are also being sold for Rs40 to Rs80 as it is convenient to carry all the necessary items together.
 
 For kids, rakhis having the pictures of Pokemon, Chota Bhim, Doraemon and teddy bear are in great demand. These rakhis are being sold from Rs15 to Rs30. However, many shopkeepers regretted that the sale has dipped this year compared to previous years. Some of them attributed it to increase in online purchases and smaller players entering the market.
