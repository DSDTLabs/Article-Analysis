Keri: High demand of   wood in Maharashtra, coupled with restrictions on its transportation, has led to a rise in its illegal trade in Goa. 

 Sub-divisional forest officer of Ponda, A G Samant, told TOI, “Earlier, licences were given for felling khair trees and also a permit was issued to transport the wood to other states. A permit is no longer given for its transportation.”
 
 Forest officials of Pernem and Ponda have confiscated large amounts of illegally transported khair wood and have booked offences against the law-breakers. 
 
 The thorny, deciduous trees that usually grow up to 15 metres, are in demand in Maharashtra as a substance called ‘kattha’ is extracted from its heart wood, which is used to lend a red hue and distinct flavour to paan (betel leaf). 
 
 Range forest officer of Pernem Vilas Gawas, told TOI, “Since the beginning of the year, our staff confiscated 39 trees in Dhargal that were illegally transported. At Aai and Matane in Dodamarg, there are two processing units of kattha. In Talawade near Sawantwadi, large-scale processing of kattha is done. Khair wood from Goa is taken to Maharashtra.”
 
 Ponda range forest officer Deepak Betkikar, said, “Our staff earlier confiscated nine khair trees in Usgao. More recently, we seized a pick-up truck carrying logs of 15 khair trees to Maharashtra.”
