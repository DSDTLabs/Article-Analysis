MUMBAI: The Govandi-Deonar belt in the eastern suburbs emerged as a major Muslim stronghold in the civic polls, electing five   corporators and one from the Hyderabad-based and Assaduddin Owaisiled Majlis-e-Ittihadul Muslimeen, which made its debut with two seats. But SP's overall tally fell from nine in 2012 to six, possibly because of a split in the Muslim vote. Two Muslim candidates from the Sena won--from Bandra (E) and Jogeshwari (W). 

 Muslim voters got confused due to the presence of so many candidates from the community in wards with significant Muslim votes. While Muslims backed non-Muslim candidates in several seats, including those from Shiv Sena, Muslim candidates from parties such as the Hyderabad-headquartered and Assaduddin Owaisi-led MIM and SP didn't get non-Muslim votes,“ said former MLA Sohail Lokhandwala.
 
 Two Muslim candidates from the Shiv Sena too won, suggesting that a section of the community's votes went to the Sena.
 
 However, all five Muslim candidates from BJP lost.
 
 Significantly, the Govandi-Deonar belt in the eastern suburbs emerged as a major Muslim stronghold in the polls, electing as many as five SP corporators and one from the MIM.Six of the 15 corporators in the M-East Ward belong to Muslim parties.
 
 The ward has also elected six corporators from the Sena and one each from Congress, BJP and NCP. In 2012, the ward had four SP corporators. This time, Congress and Dalit parties appear to have lost space to the SP and the MIM.
 
 “Muslims here have not voted for the Congress but for SP. It did not matter to the public that we were first-timers,“ said SP corporator Ruksana Siddiqui. While the MIM was expected to compete for the Muslim vote here, it doesn't seem to have affected SP's performance.
