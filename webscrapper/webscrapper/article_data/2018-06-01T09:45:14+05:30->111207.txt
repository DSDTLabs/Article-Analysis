BHOPAL: Defending MP chief minister  , Union home minister   on Thursday said that what Chouhan said is absolutely true and   is provoking farmer agitations not only in MP, but in Maharashtra and the southern states for political gains. 

 "What Shivrajji said about Congress is very much true. This is a Congress sponsored agitation and no farmers' union is involved in the agitation. Congress has a tendency to play pranks", Rajnath told reporters during a press meet here on the completion of four years of Narendra Modi-led NDA regime.
 
 Rajnath said Congress becomes active during elections by misleading people. The so-called farmers' agitation from June 1 is also the brainchild of the Congress.
 
 "What happened to Kalavati (the widowed Vidharbha farmer who shot to fame after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi visited her in 2008 and narrated her plight in the Parliament) and Bhatta Parsaul (a village in   from where Rahul Gandhi started protests in 2011 against farm land acquisition, leading to the enactment of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013). It is the Congress that misleads the public and has taken up the   issue to provoke farmers against the BJP-led state government", said the Union minister.
 
 Singh also attacked the Congress for raising its voice against the skyrocketing prices of petrol and diesel across the country. He, however, said that the government was trying its best to solve the crisis.
 
 "Our government is trying to solve it (fuel price hike) so that the general public doesn't suffer", Rajnath said. Citing an increase in the prices of crude oil in the international market, the Union minister said that the fuel price hike, which is a result of the rising global oil prices, has not affected the economy of the country.
