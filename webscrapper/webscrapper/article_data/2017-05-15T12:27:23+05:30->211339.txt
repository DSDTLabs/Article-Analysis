PATNA: Climbing the stairs to reach the top of   to have a bird’s eye view of the city does not seem possible in the coming days as the renovation of this   is still going on. 

 Sources said the renovation work, which is at least three years behind the schedule, was to be completed by the end of fiscal 2013-14. But it will take at least two more months to complete the renovation, sources said. 
 
 Though the directorate of art, culture and youth department had earlier claimed the visitors would be allowed to climb the staircase in January this year, it could not be possible even after four months of the fresh deadline. 
 
 It is to be noted that the repair work of Golghar, which is under the directorate of state art, culture and youth department, was handed over to the Archaeological Survey of India ( ) in 2011 after its inner wall developed a 68ft-long crack. 
 
 ASI officials looking after its renovation said though the restoration of inner wall was done within two years by using pressure grouting technique to fill the crack, the work on the outer wall got delayed because of lack of nuts and bolts required for joining the iron scaffoldings. 
 
 Keeping in mind their safety, visitors were denied entry to the landmark structure after the repair work on its western side staircase was almost over. The repair of its eastern side staircase began in July last year and is likely to take another two months to complete, sources said. “Around Rs1 crore has been earmarked for the renovation of this giant structure, which is 96 feet high and has the foodgrain storage capacity of 1,40,000 tonne,” said an ASI source.
