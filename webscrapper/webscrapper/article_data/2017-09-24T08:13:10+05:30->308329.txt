NEW DELHI: The inaugural World T20 changed the landscape of Twenty20 cricket with India going from outsiders - they barely had a domestic T20 setup owing to the BCCI's apathy towards the format - to lifting the title at a packed The Wanderers after beating arch-rivals Pakistan in an epic final.

 On September 24, 2007 in Johannesburg, India beat Pakistan by five runs to win the World Twenty20.   was the star with the bat for India, hitting 75 off 54 balls to get the total to 157 for 5 against a spirited Pakistan performance in the field, but Rohit Sharma's unbeaten 16-ball 30 proved a crucial cameo.
 
 RP Singh struck early with the wickets of Mohammad Hafeez and Kamran Akmal, and Irfan was excellent with figures of 3/16 in his quota as India applied the squeeze. Once again it was Misbah ul Haq left with the task of taking Pakistan to an improbable win, and with 54 needed from 24 balls with three wickets in hand he almost did. Almost. After hitting   for three sixes in the 17th over, Misbah appeared at his unflappable best until the final over.
 
  
  
 
 
 After much thinking   put faith in   for the last six balls, from which Pakistan required 13. The first ball was a wide; the second a full toss which Misbah put away for six. The Pakistan fans at the ground were jubilant, the Indian supporters crestfallen. That's when Misbah walked across his stumps to paddle Joginder to fine leg, only to miscue the shot and find Sreesanth lurking at short fine leg. The second Sreesanth took the catch, The Wanderers exploded.
