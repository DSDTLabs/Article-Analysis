AHMEDABAD: With the poor recovery levels of property tax at most municipalities and municipal corporations in the country, experts present at a conference emphasized upon municipal governments monetizing on land, instead of depending on property tax revenues alone. The two-day conference on ‘Urban Development: Technological Solutions and Governance Challenges’ was organized in Ahmedabad on Thursday. In fact, the conference is a lead-up event to the third annual meeting of   (AIIB) scheduled to be held in June this year in Mumbai.

 In his lead presentation, O P Mathur, senior fellow and head – Urban Studies, Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi, said, “It is high time state and central governments recognize the role of municipal governments in development of urban infrastructure and it is important to fiscally empower them. One of the ways this can be done is through monetizing land, which must be used as a source of revenue in addition to property tax.”
 
 Experts also said that lack of private finance is one of the major challenges in urban development. Highlighting the condition of property tax collection in  , Mukesh Puri, principal secretary, department of urban development and urban housing, Gujarat, said, “While municipal corporations record property tax collection of more than 90%, the recovery is poor across 160 municipalities with an average of 50% or even less.”
 
 “This is the reason why the government has planned to depute regional municipal commissioners in various areas for unlocking the assets and recovering the untapped potential of local bodies in the state,” he added.
 
 Puri also spoke about various town planning schemes in the state and said, “Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority, has a capital of Rs 1,000 crore for 2018-19, of which Rs 250 crore has been spent on infrastructural development.”
