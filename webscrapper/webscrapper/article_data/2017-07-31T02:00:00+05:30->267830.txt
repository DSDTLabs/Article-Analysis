PATNA: The   on Sunday hit out at CM   over the induction of LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan’s brother  , who is neither an MLA nor an MLC, in   cabinet and asked him (Nitish) to explain whether the elevation of Paras is aimed at ‘serving people’ or ‘serving a particular family’.

 RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said Nitish, while speaking in favour of his trust motion in   on July 28, had said the mandate was given to him to serve people and a particular family. Gagan said the LJP’s Paras is neither an MLA nor an MLC. His only merit is that he is brother of LJP chief Paswan.
 
 “The LJP already has two members – Raju Tiwari and Raj Kumar Sah – in the assembly and one member, Nootan Singh, in the legislative council. But the CM blatantly ignored the LJP’s three legislators and chose Paswan’s brother to induct as minister despite he being a non-MLA. In fact, Paras was rejected by voters in the last 2015 assembly election,” Gagan told TOI. Paras contested the 2015 assembly election from his traditional seat Alauli in Khagaria district as LJP candidate, but was defeated by RJD’s Chandan Kumar.
 
 Gagan said people of Bihar today wanted to know from the CM the criteria for induction of Paras in the cabinet. “The CM always talks about morality in politics. People of this state sent two candidates of LJP to the assembly. They were elected by voters. But the CM chose Paras who was rejected by voters to appoint as minister. Is it morality in politics?” he asked.
