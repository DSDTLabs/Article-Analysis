Their stories are full of grit and the burning desire to reach the top, literal ly. Now, the lives of   Gayen and Tusi Das -the two Everesters from   -will be turned into a Bengali film by the hitmaker duo of Nandita Roy and   Mukherjee. With this, the directors want to take Tollywood to where it's never gone before, as they plan to shoot at the   base camp. 'Stories that touch everyone's heart have always inspired us. Nothing can beat Chhanda and Tusi's stories and this will be our most difficult film. We are researching the lives of these two women and their families are helping us.   Gayen, Chhanda's brother, has given us her diaries which are helping us put the script together. Tusi is also providing us with valuable information, like how frostbite had taken a toll on her eyesight and she actually saw Everest with one eye! These two women are inspiration for all and I feel their stories should reach everyone,' said Shiboprosad about his dream project, which is titled Joyee.

 Chhanda and Tusi, both of whom summited Everest in 2013, had different trajectories to the top. While Tusi sold eggs for a living at a Dum Dum market, Chhanda sold her we dding jewellery to pursue her dream. Chhanda died during a tragic Kanchenjunga expedition in 2014. Tusi was also part of the same climb, but managed to return to safety .
 
 The director is tight-lipped about the cast of Joyee. 'That will happen only after the research for the film is complete. The actors we cast as Chhanda Gayen and Tusi Das will have to go through rigorous training and learn mountaineering,' said Shiboprosad.
 
 Tusi, who lives in Nainital now, told us that she was super-excited that she would see her life on celluloid. Jyotirmoy said, 'We still can't accept that Chhanda is not with us.When Shiboprosad Mukherjee and Nandita Roy approached us, we couldn't say no, as we want the story of our sister's success to reach everyone. And what better medium than a film for that?'
