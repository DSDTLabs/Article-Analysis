NAVI MUMBAI:   by industrial clusters continues to be rampant as nearly 50 per cent of common effluents treatment plants (CETP) in the state have not been able to meet the green norms.

 As many as 11 of the 25 CETPs have failed the parameters for biological oxygen demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) levels, as per the last report uploaded on the website of   ( ), which monitors the CETPs. While   is the measure of oxygen required for converting organic waste into food and ambient oxygen level for healthy aquatic life,   is measure of oxygen as per toxic waste.
 
  
  
 
 Besides, 12 of them have failed the COD test. 
 
 An MPCB official said, “Nearly 50 % of the CETPs are non-performing. We categorise treated waste into green, orange and red. Green (code) is within norms, orange slightly polluted and red the worst case of pollution, but orange is equated with pollution.”
 
 While officials of both MPCB and   (MIDC) have expressed concern over the poor effluent treatment, they are at loggerheads over the new norms stipulated by the Central government in January 2016.
 
 According to the new norms, all CETPs, whether in the coastal belt or hinterland, will have to treat the effluent at a higher grade for better aquatic life. For the CETPs discharging waste in the creek, the change is big BOD from the earlier < 100 mg /l to <30 mg /l .
 

  The number of violations and percentage would only increase if the new norms are enforced. An MIDC official said, “The norms will be gradually implemented as CETPs have renewal periods of five years when it will be enforced.”
