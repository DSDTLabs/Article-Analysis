If you work with a doyen, you can’t escape her charm. Pakistani actress   plays Sridevi’s screen   in 'Mom'. Reportedly, the 23-year-old was in awe of her reel step-mother. When asked about their rapport on the set,   says, “We are very friendly and she calls me   in real life, too. There were a few scenes in which we had to be restrained. So, before shooting those, we had to maintain a distance from each other. She is unbelievably talented; she’s a silent killer.”
