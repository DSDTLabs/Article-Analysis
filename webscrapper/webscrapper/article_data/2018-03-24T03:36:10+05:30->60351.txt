LUDHIANA:   (AAP)   has welcomed the   to set aside the election commission ruling disqualifying the 20 MLAs of Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi and claimed that they were disqualified without giving them opportunity of proper hearing.

 Welcoming the decision, AAP spokesperson Punjab Darshan Singh Shankar said that this decision of Delhi HC will be seen as a big blow on the face on Union   Govt and its then puppet Chief Election Commissioner AK Joti, who had recommended the case of 20 AAP MLAs for disqualification to President of India a day before the completion of his term as   obliging his masters without giving the opportunity of hearing to them which was requisite for natural justice. Shankar said that the decision was amounting to murder of democracy, as the EC Joti, who was especially picked up by Modi for the constitutional post of CEC acted in an autocratic unconstitutional way leaving aside the pleas of the affected MLAs for giving them hearing. “Joti was a blue eyed officer of Modi who had served as his Chief Secretary in Gujarat’, said AAP Spokesperson.
 
  Shankar further added that the AAP MLAs had not availed any benefit which can be presumed as office of profit , where as many MLAs of   were continuing as CPSs in the BJP ruled states of Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pardesh at the time of decision.
 
  He slammed Modi Government at Centre for “unnecessarily harassing and creating hurdles” for the Kejriwal Govt. from the day one, on one pretext or the other, which was very dangerous for the federal system of governance in the country. He warned that the people of country were seriously watching the behaviour of BJP led Union Government towards AAP Delhi Government, which has been "excellently performing" particularly for improving education , health and other facilities in Capital of country .
 
 “Reacting to the dictatorial attitude of BJP, the people in many states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pardesh , UP and   had recently given a big jolt to BJP by defeating its candidates during bye elections to Lok Sabha”, AAP spokesperson added.
