KOLKATA: A dent detected on the wing of a   aircraft during a routine inspection forced the grounding of the plane with engineers suspecting a bird-hit behind the damage. The aircraft later flew back to Mumbai for repairs after   officials went through a report sent by Jet Airways engineers on the nature and extent of damage and certified it fit to make the return journey to the base.

 The dent on the front edge of the right wing was detected by an engineer examining the plane after flight 9W 665 from Bengaluru landed in Kolkata. Suspecting it to have been caused by a bird-hit, the apron control at Kolkata airport was alerted to look for bird carcass around the runway.
 
 But with no trace of the dead bird, Jet Airways officials suspect the bird-hit happened during takeoff at Bengaluru and not during landing in Kolkata. Bird-hits, especially involving bigger birds like kites and eagles, are hazardous and cause extensive damage to planes. It gets particularly tricky if the bird gets sucked into the engine, damaging the blades. It can also cause a short-circuit that can in turn spark a fire. On Friday , the 141 persons on board the Jet Airways flight were lucky the bird hit the wing just above the engine and did not get drawn into it or else the   737-800 aircraft would have had to return to Bengaluru after the takeoff.
 
 There have been several bird-hits in Kolkata in the past but the number of incidents reported has gone down in recent years. Municipal authorities around the airport attribute this to better solid waste management and replacement of open garbage dumps with compactors in many places. But the bird activity around the Rajarhat end is still a cause of worry.
 
 “At the airport environment committee meeting held every six months, we tell municipal authorities to ensure cleanliness so that birds don't hang around the airport. There has been progress but there is still some distance to go,“ an airport official said.
