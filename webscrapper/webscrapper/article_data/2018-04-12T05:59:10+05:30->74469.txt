NEW DELHI: Complementing BJP's wide-ranging Ambedkar-centric activities, RSS affiliated weekly ‘Organiser’ has dedicated this week’s edition to the Dalit icon, recalling his ideology and political rivalry with   and Left. 

 
 The weekly has used ‘Ramji’ as Ambedkar’s middle name, a move initiated by the UP government, which has been questioned in various quarters. 
 
 “There have been attempts by the Congress and communists to categorically represent Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar’s political praxis as their own. Facts of history laugh at all such efforts because Babasaheb was disgusted with both,” the weekly wrote in its cover story. 
 
 On questions about who owned Ambedkar’s legacy, the weekly said, “To be true, the whole Bharat owns it. However, political forces which believe in breaking Bharat have been misappropriating Babasaheb for their schismatic plans. That is precisely what the Congress and the communists are up to now. They are disfiguring the whole Ambedkarite political idiom of reform, inclusion, democracy and development to suit their agendas of creating division, chaos and conflict.”
 
 It went on to say that Ambedkar’s original writings, when read and reproduced in the right context, affirmed that Congress and communists “detested him and discriminated against him”.
 
 The magazine recalled how Marxists like   who tried to situate   in the multi-linear methodology known as Ma.Phu.Aa (Marxism-Phule-Ambedkarism) had to bear with a long internal struggle within the CPM on the question of caste struggle. Patil eventually founded the   in 1978 because CPM couldn’t see electoral gains in the Dalit movement then, which it sees now, the weekly said.
