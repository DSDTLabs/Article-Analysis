PATIALA: Demanding the release of their due   that has not been paid for the past six months, the faculty of Rayat   Centre for Excellence,   on Sangrur road staged a protest in the front gate of the campus. The faculty members have been protesting against the management of the institute since Monday following which lectures of various departments were suspended.

 The protesting faculty also alleged mental harassment at the hands of the authorities of the institute who, it was alleged, have been violating the   norms and labour laws. The protesting teachers also blamed the management for taking advance fees from the students for the past few years.
 
 “From the past six months we have not been paid the salaries and when we demand for the same, they rudely turn away the faculty members claiming that the authorities will pay them on their own will. Earlier too, we have faced harassment by not being paid for three to four months but this time the management has crossed the limits. Besides this, we are forced to sign a letter that violates the labour laws too as under it we have to give three-month notice period before leaving the job failing which we’ll not be paid the salary for three months,” said an agitating woman faculty member.
 
 There are around 70 faculty members and around 1,400 students in the campus where pharmacy, management, dipoma, BTech, MBA and other courses are taught. The management of the institute claimed that they are yet to receive Rs 4 crore under post-matric scholarship scheme for the scheduled caste and scheduled tribes students from the government and as a result of its delay they have been facing hardships in paying salaries.
 
 Director of the Rayat Bahra Centre   said, “Salary of only two months has not been paid to the faculty. We have promised to pay the pending salary till Dushehra.”
