 Left with little option, state police recently approached the Centre for help. "At least 374 sites have been connected using the BSNL network whereas 91 locations are working offline due to connectivity issues. The matter has been taken up with the Centre," DGP   said.
 
 Under the CCTNS, at least 312 police stations and 154 other offices including police headquarters, scientific and technical organizations, ballistic and fingerprint bureaus will be linked.
