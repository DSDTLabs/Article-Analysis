'  — Emotion Ka Confusion', the makers say, is a classic example of like-minded people joining hands to make content-driven cinema. 
The film, presented by  , Green Apple Media and Falansha Media Pvt Ltd, is about the chaos and confusion caused by a mixture of strong emotions. Directed by Rajesh Ram Singh, it stars Darshan Kumar, Pia Bajpai, Priyanshu Chatterjee, Swanand Kirkire and Chandan Roy Sanyal in pivotal roles. 
 
  of Falansha Media Pvt Ltd says, “This movie has been a delightful experience because I could associate with a team of dedicated people. I’ve been working with   of Green Apple for four years. Shemaroo came on board a little later, but   from the company was extremely supportive from the word go.” 
 
 Neeraj, on his part, beams, “This journey is about my trust in Amit. I’m not from the industry, so I followed my gut feeling. Of course, Shemaroo’s entry into the picture strengthened my instincts about the film.”
 
 Though common perception is that only big-ticket films move the box office, content-driven films are also finding plenty of takers these days. Ketan says, “We are all equally enthusiastic about good content. After the experience of working together on 'Mirza Juuliet', we’re sure we’ll team up in future too.”
