A teenage slum dweller is on trial for the murder of his abusive father. All evidence hints at him. How difficult could it be for a   of twelve to make a unanimous judgement? But one raises a doubt, forcing the rest to confront facts and examine the possibilities beyond, opening a Pandora’s box of sorts, of personal agenda and prejudice.

 Directed by Nadir Khan and based on  , the 1957 American noir courtroom drama film,  , that will be staged on Sunday at Susie Sorabji Auditorium, will examine what a courtroom would be like, if jury trial still existed in India. Thespian and producer   says, though the treatment and characters are aligned to the Indian context, the script is Reginald Rose’s original. “Though India doesn’t have a jury system, and the script dates back several decades, it raises relevant questions even today,” he adds.
 
 Twelve men and women from different walks of life, are responsible for deciding on the boy’s future. “Over the course of the play, one understands where they come from and what influences their decisions,” says Rajit, who plays the role of one of the jury members. Besides its ensemble cast, the play is also logistically demanding. Rajit says, “Not every venue can accommodate the large sets and technical intricacies it requires.” 
 
 As a medium, the film had the luxury of cutting, to create the tension a courtroom drama requires. How the same can be achieved in theatre, should be reason enough to watch it.
