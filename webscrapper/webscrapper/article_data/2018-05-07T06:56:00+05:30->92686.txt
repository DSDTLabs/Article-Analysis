Malda: Violence has claimed more lives barely a week before   elections in Bengal. While Trinamool worker Nayan Mandal (20) was shot dead in Malda’s Raghunathpur village on Saturday night, Congress supporter Pancha Musahar (40) died on Sunday morning at Malda Medical College and Hospital (MMCH) of injuries after bombs were thrown at him and some others on Friday night. In Purulia , Aditya Singh Malla (62), whose wife and son are TMC candidates, died after being attacked at the party office in Barabazar. Five BJP men were arrested.

 Nayan was shot in the head while returning from an election campaign. Women and social welfare minister Sashi Panja, who visited the family, said: “With people no longer supporting it, Congress is resorting to violence. Police will take action.” Congress MP Mousam Noor denied this, saying: “This is the result of the TMC factional feud. We are not involved.”
