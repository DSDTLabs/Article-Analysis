SURAT:   (SMC) will be implementing a pilot project on parking on seven major roads of the city. If people are found parking their vehicles on any of these roads, they would be charged for parking according to the rates decided by SMC. The city has a road network of 2,200km but is yet to come out with a   on roads. SMC expects to earn additional revenue of Rs150 crore per annum from this venture. 

 Surat has a population of around 50 lakh people and at least 27 lakh vehicles. Till now, the civic body has been able to make provision for parking only 50,000 vehicles, including two-wheelers in the city area. However, in the absence of a policy, people park their vehicles wherever they wish. 
 
 “Vehicles parked on either sides of the road lead to traffic jams,” said an officer from the traffic department of SMC. The pilot project on parking for the seven roads in seven zones of the city is expected to come into effect by this month-end. 
 
 Municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said, “The project is in the process of being finalized in consultation with police. Thereafter, contracts will be awarded for parking. The basic aim is to regulate parking on public roads and reduce traffic congestion.” 
 
 A survey conducted by the   (UMTCL) for SMC had made several suggestions. These included smart parking provisions for residents. People would be able to mark out available parking slots in specific areas and even book them before starting from their houses.
 
 “Initially, we are looking at proper implementation of parking project on these seven roads. There is maximum capacity to altogether park 3,263 four wheelers or four times more two-wheelers here. Tenders would be floated in a week’s time for the contracts,” another SMC officer said.
