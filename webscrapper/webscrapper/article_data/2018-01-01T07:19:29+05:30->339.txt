BENGALURU: A city hospital is among 15 health facilities from across the country that will implement spacesafety and quality measures in their emergency and intensive care departments to eliminate hospital-induced errors and emergency mortality rates.

 The expanded pilot project is being taken up after the measures were adopted by a 200-bed Chennai hospital. Three weeks after implementing the 20 space safety and quality steps in itsemergency and intensive healthcare units, the hospital recorded an overall improvement in patient safety from 0.05% to1.5% and a striking drop in emergency department mortality rate by 1.2%.
 
  
  
 
 Implementation of measures used in the space industry, a first in global history, is part of Health Quest, a platform driven by medical experts from   (SEMI),   (ISCCM),   (AHPI) and scientists from Indian Space Research Organisation ( ). In Bengaluru, Narayana Hrudayalaya will adopt the measures as part of the pilot.
