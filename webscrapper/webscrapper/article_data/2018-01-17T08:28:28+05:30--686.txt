TIRUPUR: Avinashi-Athikadavu scheme struggle committee has submitted a petition to   district rural police seeking permission to start an indefinite hunger strike again as there was no progress in the implementation of the scheme.

 The struggle committee said the government had promised to complete tender process by December and start the project, which was to irrigate drought-prone areas in Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode districts.
 
 “Earlier, the government announced under the scheme it would construct canals from the   river to feed the irrigation tanks in the three western districts. But later it decided to pump water from the river and supply it through pipelines, for which it allotted Rs 250 crore. But the government was yet to modify its earlier order,” said M S  , a convenor of the committee.
 
 “While participating in MGR centenary birth anniversary celebrations in Tirupur last July, chief minister   promised that the government would complete tender process for the project and lay the foundation stone by December as well as to complete the entire project within 30 months. But, no action was taken,” said D Prabakaran, another coordinator.
 
 The farmers are waiting for more than six decades for the scheme. “We are forced to take up the hunger strike, as we did in 2016, so, we have sought permission from the Tirupur police to allow us to conduct the stir again from February 8,” said Prabakaran.
 
 It was to be noted that a group of farmers had started an indefinite strike in February 8, 2016, and when the strike entered the twelfth day, the state government passed the first order regarding the scheme.
