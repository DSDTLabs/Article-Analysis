 On Friday, one of the yatras started from   on Viital Malya Road and the party chose the venue to highlight the recent incident involving MLA NA Harris's son  , and called it "Gunda Raj under the Congress." The march ended at Brigade Road-Residency Road Junction, near Harris' residence. 
 
 "Shanthinagar has become Ashanthinagar thanks to the Gunda Raj prevailing here. People must teach Harris a lesson in the elections and re-establish peace in the constituency," Union minister HN Ananthkumar, who led the padayatra along with the BJP leaders R Ashok, Aravind Limbavali, Malavika and others, said. 
 
 Earlier in the day, the march was kicked-off by Union ministers   and Ananth Kumar at Basavanagudi after offering prayers at historic Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple. 
 
 Launching the yatra, Javadekar asked the people to choose between good governance of BJP and "goonda raj" of the Congress.
 
 "Siddramaiah-led Congress government has been arrogant of power because of which law and order is deteriorated in the cities like Bangaluru," said Javadekar. 
 
 He urged the people to protect Bengaluru as he said the city deserves much better governance. On Saturday, the BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa will lead the yatra at K R Puram constituency.
