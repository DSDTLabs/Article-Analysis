CHANDIGARH: The Haryana BJP on Tuesday accused the Congress and INLD of misleading youths and using them as tool to attain publicity in the state or to woo masses. State BJP chief spokesman Rajiv Jain was referring to the incidents in which the National Students Union of India (NSUI) activists and Youth Congress workers had shown black flags to chief minister   in Panchkula, Gohana and Rohtak.

 “All this was done to tarnish the image of the BJP government and Khattar. It is being seen as an act of frustration by the Congress following the change of mindset of youth after implementation of welfare schemes,” claimed Jain. He further said they were sure that the youths of Haryana would understand the nefarious designs of both Congress and INLD. “They have already realized the transparency in the recruitments done by the government,” Jain maintained.
 
 Haryana NSUI chef Divyanshu Budhiraja and his team was the first to stop Khattar during his programme in Panchkula last month. Budhiraja and his associate   were booked and arrested after a case was registered against them in this connection. Following this, NSUI activists had chased Khattar during his programmes. Meanwhile, there had been incidents when INSO, student wing of the INLD, workers had staged protests against the government and the CM.
