NAVI MUMBAI: The staff employed by a towing van contractor has been caught pilfering petrol from seized bikes parked at the Panvel traffic chowkie. The video, shot by a citizen who noticed the offence, has gone viral on social media. The bikes parked at the chowkie had been towed away as they were illegally parked on roads. 

 Vehicle owners have raised eyebrows over security of the towed vehicles and alleged that by the time they reach the traffic chowkie to pay penalty and get back their bikes and cars, the staff employed by the towing van contractor steals petrol. 
 
 Senior inspector of Panvel traffic unit Vijay Kadbane said, "I have seen the video where a man is seen filling petrol in a bottle from the fuel tank of one of the motorcycles parked at the Panvel traffic chowkie. The man has been identified as Shaikh, the driver of a towing crane operated by a contractor. We enquired with Shaikh and he has told us that he had borrowed a bike whose fuel tank was empty. He was stealing the petrol to refuel the borrowed bike as he was in a rush to reach home."
 
 Shaikh has claimed that he took only 500ml of petrol so that he could reach a petrol pump. "We have complained to the towing crane contractor, who has sacked the driver. Shaikh has claimed that he is not a habitual petrol thief and that he had committed the crime first time as it was an emergency."
