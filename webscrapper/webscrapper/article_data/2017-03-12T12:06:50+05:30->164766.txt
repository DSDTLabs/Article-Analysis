 Ranchi Gaushala Samiti secretary Ranjit Tiberewal said, “Traditionally we are supposed to use cow dung cakes for Holika bonfire but we hardly get them these days. So, we decided to make and distribute cow dung cakes.” Cow dung cakes are environment-friendly as compared other sources of the bonfire.
 
 A member of another cow welfare group, Gau Sewa Pariwar Samiti, Ajay Bharatiya said, “Using the cow dung cakes will not only prevent the felling of trees and air pollution but will also help in purifying the air.”
 
 “Nowadays, people burn everything including tyres and other things which pollute the environment to a great extent. Burning cow dung cakes will also kill insects,” he added. 
 
 The cowshed at Ranchi Gaushala Samiti houses as many as 700 cows. They have prepared around 40,000 cow dung cakes for the festival. 
 
 “We are requesting people to bring camphor and cardamom for burning Holika so that it helps in purifying the environment,” Bharatiya said. 
 
 The overwhelming response from citizens has encouraged the Ranchi Gaushala Samiti to prepare for the next Holi.
 
 Tiberewal said, “This was the first attempt and the response from citizens has been wonderful. We are hoping to bring more awareness in the coming days. We intend to start ahead from next year and prepare cow dung cakes on a larger scale.”
