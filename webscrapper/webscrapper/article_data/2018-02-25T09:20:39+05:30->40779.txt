HYDERABAD: Around 100   were pressed into action to relocate   from   as part of the Charminar Pedestrianisation Project. Earlier, a meeting was held with the hawkers and police. The local legislator and corporators conducted the meeting at Charminar on Saturday.

 
 As part of the project, hawkers and pushcart vendors selling fruits and other commodities in the vicinity of the historic monument will be relocated to Charminar bus depot.
 
 While fruit vendors were relocated to the bus depot, other hawkers selling artificial jewellery, clothes and shoes feared that they will lose their source of living. The government is yet to show them an alternative place.
 
 
 There are more than 800 hawkers in Charminar apart from fruit vendors. “Fruit vendors have been relocated but what about us,” questioned a hawker. When STOI visited the place, hawkers aired their grievances saying they will be rendered jobless. “We earn around Rs 300 to Rs 400 daily and this stall is my only source of income. I request the authorities to provide us an alternative place,” said one of the hawkers.
 
 
 Police and politicians are in a dilemma over the hawkers’ issue. Pathergatti corporator, who attended the meeting along with Charminar legislator Ahmed Pasha Quadri, suggested that hawkers be relocated to the Kaman near   near the law and order police station. “We have requested the cops to relocate the hawkers on the pavement on both sides of the road starting from the temple to  ,” said Syed Sohail Quadri, Pathergatti corporator.
 
 
 Barricades have been set up near Charminar bus station exclusively for hawkers where they have been relocated on Saturday.
 
 
 Flexis and hoardings have been pulled down at Gulzar Houz and Panchmahal.
