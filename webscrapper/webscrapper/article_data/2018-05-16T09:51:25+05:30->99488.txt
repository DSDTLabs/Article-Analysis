HYDERABAD: Making it clear that transport authorities are entitled to collect life tax from the owner of a vehicle only on the price he paid for owning it and not on the ex-showroom prices, Justice M S   of the   has directed the Hyderabad transport authorities to refund ?51,000 excess tax collected from a Hyderabad resident.

 The judge pronounced this order after hearing a petition filed by   who challenged the way the authorities are calculating and determining the life tax to be paid. According to his counsel Pranay Sohini, Kishore Rai bought   XC 60 D5 inscription model vehicle in January 2018 from a Hyderabad dealer,  .
 
 Though the ex-showroom price of the vehicle is ?55.90 lakh, the dealer gave a discount of ?3 lakh on the cost of the vehicle and sold it for ?52.90 lakh. But when the vehicle was taken to the transport department for registration, they calculated life tax basing on ex-showroom price and made him to pay ?51,000 more.
 
 “We have no other option than to pay first because we already reserved a number and any delay in getting the vehicle registered within 15 days would result in cancellation of the number allotted to us under   Vehicle Rules,” the counsel said. The judge did not agree with the contention of the state counsel who argued that the practice of dealers giving discounts is an unethical practice that hurts the state exchequer. There is no law prohibiting dealers from giving discounts and it is,a valid trade practice, the judge said in his order. The judge allowed the plea of the petitioner and directed the authorities to refund the excess tax money within four weeks.
