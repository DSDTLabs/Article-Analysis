BENGALURU: With   failing between   management and employees over several issues including the latter’s demand for regularisation of services,   (BMREU) has threatened to go on an indefinite strike.

 Last month, BMREU deferred their proposed indefinite strike from March 22 for a month after both the staff and management agreed to hold discussions as per the   high court’s suggestion. 
 
 Suryanarayana Murthy, vice-president, BMREU, told TOI that they have conducted several rounds of talks with the BMRCL management since March 26. “But there was no outcome from the past eight meetings. We will soon finalise a date for the strike,” he said.
 
 “We may also be forced to go for a flash strike without any prior notice if our demands are not met. We have already placed all our demands to the management, but there has been no response from them so far. We have no other options as the management is not considering our genuine demands,” said Murthy.
 
 Sources say the BMRCL management is mainly opposing BMREU’s primary demand to recognize the union and also to abolish contract labour system.
 
 “We are not in a position to take a decision because of the election model code of conduct,” said a senior BMRCL official. “We can’t recognise the union as most leaders are outsiders who has no role in BMRCL. We always consider the genuine demands of our employees.”
 
 Murthy said the election model code of conduct will not be applied in this case as it is an internal matter of BMRCL and these talks were initiated before the elections itself.
