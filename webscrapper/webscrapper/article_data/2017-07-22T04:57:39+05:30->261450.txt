NEW DELHI: Opposition parties may have upped the ante against the government for bringing in a paradigm change in its policy towards Israel but the ruling   is making no bones about the warmth in ties with the Jewish nation. The party and forums related to it continue discussing the recent visit of PM   to Israel as well as the US and the success they achieved.

 Headed by BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav, the India Foundation on Friday organised a breakfast briefing on PM’s US and Israel visits which was attended by envoys of more than 30 countries and saw participation of more than 50 foreign missions.
 
 Madhav himself was the moderator and foreign secretary S Jaishankar spoke about the significance and success of Modi’s visit to the two nations. This was the sixth breakfast briefing series organised by the India Foundation aiming to apprise foreign dignitaries on India’s viewpoint on key issues engaging world attention.
 
 However, the focus on Israel shows that the saffron leadership is optimistic that ties with the middle-east nation are set to get stronger especially after the personal bonding Modi developed with his counterpart  .
 
 Even during the parliamentary party meet on Wednesday, foreign minister   briefed the party MPs about Modi’s visit to the two nations.
 
 The party continues to highlight the Israel trip despite the opposition’s reservations about a tilt towards Israel after Modi became the first PM to visit the nation which his predecessors avoided due to its conflict with Palestine.
