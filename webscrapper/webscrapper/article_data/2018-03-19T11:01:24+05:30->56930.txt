Kochi: With no assurance from   management on renewing his contract, full-back   is mulling a return to his former club   in the next season. It is learnt that   runners-up have given a huge offer to the Kerala defender and the Thrissur-born lad might sign the pre-contract in the next couple of days if the Blasters management is unwilling to extend the contract.

 
 
 Sources close to the player said that though Blasters CEO Varun Tripuraneni and head coach David James have been saying that Rino is an integral part of their future plans, there has not been any move from the management towards extending his contract. “Sometimes the team management will be hoping that they might be able to sign Rino in a low fare once the offers from other clubs dry out. This is not an ideal approach from a professional team management. I heard that the management were not even picking the calls from the player’s agent,” said a source close to the player.
 
 It is also learnt that some members of the management are reluctant to renew Rino’s contract since the player missed a majority of the season through injuries. “If Blasters management feels that Rino is injury-prone, then what is wrong in signing with a club which assures playing time for the defender,” said the source.
 
 Sources close to the team have confirmed that if Rino leaves Blasters, then striker CK Vineeth also might leave the squad. It is learnt that Vineeth is on the radar of clubs like Jamshedpur FC and ATK though he is yet to initiate any talks with these clubs.
 
 Kerala Blasters, after failing to reach the playoffs in a disappointing season, have roped in winger Halicharan Narzary from NEUFC and midfielder Sakeer M from Mumbai City FC in other transfer developments.
