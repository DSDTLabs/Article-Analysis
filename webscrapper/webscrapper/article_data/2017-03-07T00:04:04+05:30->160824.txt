New  : With civic elections drawing near, political parties are leaving no stone unturned to ensure that they don’t fall foul of the electorate. The east corporation, for one, has effectively put a stop to all forms of punitive action, including sealing and demolition   and issuance of notices/fines for various violations. 

 At a meeting on Monday, the   standing committee directed commissioner Mohanjeet Singh to immediately halt all such punitive action, whether they relate to conversion or parking charges, or factory licence violations. 
 
 Standing committee chairman Jitender Chaudhary said: “The model code of conduct will come into force within 10 days. So, this might be our last standing committee meeting. I have directed the commissioner to stop all such punitive action, such as sealing and demolition and issuance of challans and notices, until the new House is constituted.” 
 
 In the last one month alone, hundreds of shops and factories have been sealed and over 2,100 notices issued to commercial properties in the Shahadra zone alone. The suspension of such action seeks to avoid the wrath of the trader community, widely seen as the support base of BJP. The traders have already been badly hit by the Centre’s demonetisation move. 
 
 Leader of the House, Sanjay Jain, said: “Every day, notices are being issued to traders. Shops and factories are being sealed and people are living in an atmosphere of terror. Traders are being inconvenienced. This should stop immediately.”
 
 Officials aren’t happy with the move, though. A senior corporation official told TOI: “There is no precedent of elections leading to suspension of legal action against violators. Law doesn’t get suspended during elections. If there are violations, due action will be taken, irrespective of the directions.” 
 
 Among the areas that have seen wide-scale sealing and demolition are Mansarovar Park, Mandoli Road, Chandra Lok, Jyoti Colony, Jagjit Nagar, Kartar Nagar and West Jyoti Nagar.
