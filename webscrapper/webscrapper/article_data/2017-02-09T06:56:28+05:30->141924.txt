 The notification issued by P G  , additional district collector, Morbi, will be in force till February 28. 
 
 “PAAS leaders have been active in Gujarat over reservation and leaders from Dalits and OBCs are also taking out public rallies, meetings and giving memorandum to government officers over various issues. The notification has been issued to maintain law and order in these situations,” the notification states.
