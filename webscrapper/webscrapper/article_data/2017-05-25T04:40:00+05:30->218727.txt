Ahmedabad: Following the controversy over separate question papers in Gujarati and English languages during this yearâ€™s National Entrance cum Eligibility Test (NEET) for admission in medical and dental courses, parents of class XII students, who sat for NEET in Gujarati, have approached Gujarat high court demanding a retest.

 
 Earlier this month, when the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) conducted NEET, the students who took the entrance test in Gujarati language had claimed that the question paper in Gujarati was not only different, but much more difficult than the exam in English.
 
 Some of the parents, who have moved the HC through advocate Jigar Patel, have demanded that NEET should be held once again. In the alternative, they have requested the court to direct the board to prepare a separate merit list for Gujarati medium students. The petitioners have argued that since there were two different question papers for different language medium in NEET, the principle of uniformity was not maintained. Since there was no uniformity in examinations, there cannot be a combined or a common merit list on basis of these tests.
 
 It has also been contended that as the question papers were different, and the quality of questions asked in NEET in English and NEET in Gujarati differed from each other, Gujarati medium students cannot be treated at par with the students who took the tests in English. The results on basis of two different exams would be prejudicial to Gujarati medium students contended the petitioners.
 
 Advocate Patel said the petition was filed and mentioned before Justice A J Shastri for urgent hearing on the issue. The HC has fixed Friday for hearing the petition.
