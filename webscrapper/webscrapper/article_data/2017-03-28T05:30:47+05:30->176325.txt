MUMBAI: The   has put its ally, the  , in a spot by suggesting that RSS chief   should be the BJP-led  's candidate for the presidential election. Matoshree is throwing its weight around as it knows that BJP, notwithstanding its win in the UP assembly elections, needs its support in the crucial election scheduled for July. 

 The Sena gameplan is to force the BJP to take party president Uddhav Thackeray into confidence before finalising the NDA nominee for the presidential poll, said observers.
 
 Sanjay Raut, Sena MP, told mediapersons on Monday that BJP bosses will have to visit Matoshree for talks with Uddhav Thackeray on the issue. "Matoshree offers delicious food," Raut quipped.
 
 This is an indication that Thackeray will keep away from the NDA dinner conclave to be shortly hosted in New Delhi by PM  . The PM had, in a telephonic conversation recently, invited Thackeray for the NDA meet to informally discuss the presidential nominee.
 
 "Bhagwat's name is being discussed (for the presidential election). This will surely be a good choice for Hindu rashtra (nation)," Raut said. The NDA's presidential candidate should be "competent, have good knowledge of the Constitution and should be a strong nationalist," he added. Raut, the senior Sena leader who often voices the party's views on key issues in order to tap popular mood, did not elaborate on the subject. "Uddhavji will take the final decision," he added.
 
 "Sena has put us in a dilemma. It would look graceless if we outright reject Bhagwatji's candidature. But fielding him as NDA nominee is an impractical suggestion," said a senior BJP functionary. 
 
 Stating that no RSS functionary aims at holding office in government, the BJP leader said, "Not that Sena doesn't know the functioning of the Sangh Parivar. Pushing Bhagwatji's name is a move to keep BJP on a leash."
