Pune: An innovation hub with facilities for computing, robotics and fabrication, among others, has come up at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan's Muktangan Exploratory Science Centre.

 The innovation hub will encourage students to solve real-life problems using scientific principles and technologies, Nandkumar Kakirde, secretary, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, said at a news conference here on Friday.
 
 The innovation hub will be inaugurated on February 28 on the occasion of National Science Day. In addition to honing problem-solving skills, students will also be encouraged to realise their ideas and design innovative solutions for their homes, schools and society. A team of expert mentors will guide young innovators in converting their crude ideas into finished products.
 
 Anant Bhide, director, Muktangan Exploratory Science Centre, said, "The hub aims to develop basic skills in wood work, metal fabrication, electrical works, plumbing and electronics. Children will also be exposed to “how things work” and also promotion of a 'quality culture' through emphasis on aesthetics and 'fit for use' concepts."
 
 Sandip Natekar, deputy director, innovation hub, said, "Nearly 4,000 square feet of floor space has been renovated and equipped to offer different facilities to students."
 
 The exploratory has received funds under the National Council of Science Museums of the Ministry of Culture to set up the innovation hub on its premises.
