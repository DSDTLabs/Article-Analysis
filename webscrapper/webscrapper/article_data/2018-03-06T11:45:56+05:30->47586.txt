 . A well-researched historical fiction, the book takes the reader into the slow struggle of life during the Great Depression and the Civil War.

 The book starts with a father and his young daughter going to visit a man and is told from the little girl's perspective. The story switches between the perspectives of these three characters. The father disappears, the girl grows up to support her family and the man they visit runs his nightclubs with shady dealings. The different perspectives are set across different times and often change abruptly, which can be slightly confusing. The story also moves slowly, even dragging at points. However, it is beautifully written and offers great insight into the staggering changes the world went through during that crucial patch of history.
