TRICHY: While rail passengers were happy with the emphasis given to safety aspects like track maintenance, they were disappointed with the budgetâ€™s silence on railway projects since only two announcements benefiting Karnataka and   were made. 

 The finance minister had announced conversion of 4,467 unmanned level crossings into manned ones, but it is being pointed out that Trichy division was already ahead in this matter having converted 19 unmanned level crossings into manned ones. Subways had been provided in lieu of six level crossings while one crossing had been closed after diversion of the road.
 
 Capital infusion of Rs 1.46 crores was a welcome move. However, better accountability should be established for the public to reap the benefits, pointed out S Pushpavanam, secretary, Consumer Protection Council,  . Railways had returned 40 per cent of the unspent safety fund three years ago. Wi-fi for all stations and escalators in stations with over 25,000 footfall were a good public relation and image-boosting exercise.
 
 D  , deputy general secretary of   (DREU), said that the budget was silent on filling up 2.25 lakh vacant posts in the railways as well as the demand to fix minimum salary for central government employees. However, the announcement to establish   cameras in 7,136 stations was welcome.
