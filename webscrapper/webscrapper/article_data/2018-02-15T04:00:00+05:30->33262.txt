Chennai: The proposed safety norms for two wheelers effective April 2019, that deals with braking efficiency and emission among others will give Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India (HMSI) a leg up in the market, senior company officials said.

 The second largest two wheeler company already retails some of these technologies now and expects its technical edge to earn marketshare as the entire industry moves to BS6. “When the brake norms come into effect, any two wheeler up to 125 cc must be fitted with a combi-brake system and beyond 125 cc all two wheelers must have ABS. All Honda scooters are already equipped with combi brake so there will be no extra cost to the customer,” said YS Guleria, senior VP-sales and marketing, HMSI. The company introduced combi-brakes in 2009. The brake tech will also fuel a race between the entry level commuter bikes which currently command 37% of the Indian two wheeler market and scooters which command around 34%. 
 
 “Once these bikes are fitted with combi brakes, it will increase their costs and decrease their price differential with scooters which will work in favour of the scooter particularly in price conscious rural markets,” said Guleria.
 
 In motorcycles too Honda will retain a tech edge, he said, because in categories upto 125 cc HMSI, products like CB Shine and CB Shine SP already have combi brake as a variant. “Currently 20-25% of CB Shine sales come from the combi brake with equiliser variant,” said Guleria. 
 
 Honda is targeting 6 million plus units this financial year with 66-67% of those numbers coming from scooters and the rest from motorcycles. “The premium category is growing at double digit and we want to expand our portfolio,” said Guleria. 
 
 “In the existing 11 lines in 4 factories, we are looking at inhouse efficiencies and we are almost at the point of finalising the capacity that can be got out of our current lines. Thereafter we will take a call on further increase in overall capacity,” he added.
