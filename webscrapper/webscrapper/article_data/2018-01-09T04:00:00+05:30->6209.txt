Vadodara: A 50-year-old woman, whose house at Bhathujinagar in Manjalpur was demolished by Vadodara Municipal Corporation on January 3 died on Monday morning. 

 The deceased Laxmi Solanki’s family members have alleged that she died because of cold as she was sleeping in the open.
 
 After their houses were razed, Solanki and several others were living there in open space. Solanki’s nephew Dilip said that they tried to wake her up on Monday morning but she did respond. Dilip said that as it was cold on Sunday night, she died of it. However, the family members did not take her body for post-mortem to know the exact reason.
 
 When TOI contacted, Dilip said that Solanki was ill some days before the demolition took place. “My aunt was ill and was admitted to a private hospital but before the demolition happened, she was discharged. It is because of demolition that she was already in a shock and died because of cold,” he claimed.
 
 He also said that the civic body has allotted them homes at Sayajipura but they have not shifted there because of lack of amenities. “We want houses at Kalali and when we talk to top officials of VMC, they promise us but do not give us assurance in writing,” added Dilip.
 
 A day after the demolition had taken place, a father of two children residing on the same encroached house had died of heart attack.
