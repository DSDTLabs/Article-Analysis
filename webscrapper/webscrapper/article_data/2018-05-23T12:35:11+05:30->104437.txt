HUBBALLI: Former chief minister and Hubballi-Dharwad Central MLA   alleged that JD(S) supremo HD   does not want senior Congress leaders   and   as deputy CMs.

 The former CM told reporters on Tuesday that the Congress-JD(S) alliance will topple any time. “Karnataka Congress in-charge   said that the decision to whether continue with Kumaraswamy as CM for five years is not finalized. This shows that this government will not complete its full term,” he said.
 
 On the discovery of VVPATs by the roadside in Vijayapura district, Shettar demanded that the probe be handed over to the CBI. 
 
 Speaking about his sixth consecutive victory in Hubballi-Dharwad Central, Shettar said he emerged victorious with a big margin despite negative campaigning done by the Congress. “The Congress candidate spread misinformation about me but failed. BJP voters never changed their mind. The opponents did not understand that the constituency has literate voters who vote only for the BJP,” Shettar added.
