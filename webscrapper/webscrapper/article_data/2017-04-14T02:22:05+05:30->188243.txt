GURUGRAM: The state health department has formed a special committee to keep a check on mosquito-breeding and vector-borne diseases in the city, with dengue and   making an early appearance in Delhi, Gurugram’s next-door neighbour, this year.

 Though dengue and chikungunya have not yet made inroads into the Millennium City, health officials told TOI on Tuesday the committee will start a six-month-long drive against the vector-borne diseases in the district from May.
 
 Usually, dengue outbreaks occur after rains when temperature conditions are conducive for breeding of Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes which flourish in stagnant fresh water and are responsible for spreading the virus. 
 
 “But as we are seeing an early outbreak of dengue and chikungunya in the national capital, the drive will be launched in Gurugram by the first week of May this year, instead of June. The idea is to act in advance, before the mosquito-breeding season starts,” a senior health official said.
 
 “The services of Asha and Aanganwadi workers will be sought for the project. The committee will involve MCG in the drive and fogging will be done across Gurugram with the civic body’s help,” he added.
 
 According to doctors, already there has been four cases of viral infection, with symptoms close to dengue, in the city. Last year, 86 cases of dengue and 105 cases of chikungunya were recorded in Gurugram. However, deputy civil surgeon (malaria), Dr SS Saroha, said: “Initiatives can’t be completed without public participation. We conduct awareness drives and tell people not to keep stagnant water in their neighbourhood. But when that is ignored, diseases are bound to spread. We may have an early outbreak of dengue and chikungunya in Gurugram. Vector-borne diseases usually spread by July, but this time we are anticipating it from early May.”
