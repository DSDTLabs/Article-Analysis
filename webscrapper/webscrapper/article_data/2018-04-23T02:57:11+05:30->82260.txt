NEW DELHI: A 22-year-old man was crushed by a speeding   in east Delhi’s Madhu Vihar on Saturday afternoon. A CCTV camera installed in a shop captured the chilling incident in which the victim was   for several metres until the driver was forced by passengers to stop the bus.

 The incident was reported around 2pm. A police team rushed the victim, Sonu Choudhary, to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead. The driver, identified as Sukhpal Singh (49), was nabbed while trying to flee the spot.
 
  had come to Delhi from Bihar just 20 days ago. He had gone to meet a couple of friends on Friday. He was returning with them when the incident took place. The man had gone to buy a soft drink while his friends waited for him on the other side of the road. The cluster bus hit him while he was crossing the road.
 
 CCTV footage showed Choudhury crossing the road. After the bus hits him, it slows down slightly. The man tries to regain balance, but before he can do that he is hit again by the bus. After crushing him under the wheels, the bus drags him for several meters before finally coming to a halt.
 
 “When his friends raised an alarm and started shouting for help, the driver got scared and kept going. He didn’t know that Choudhary was under the wheels and getting dragged along,” said a police officer. A case has been registered at Madhu Vihar police station.
