PUNE: Unidentified culprits punctured the Mumbai- Solapur fuel pipeline belonging to   Corporation Limited ( ) and stole diesel worth Rs3 lakh.

 The theft happened over Thursday and Friday in Lohegaon, and came to light after the Solapur unit of HPCL started receiving diesel at a low pressure.
 
  (51) of the Loni Kalbhor depot filed a complaint at   police station on Saturday morning.
 
 The underground pipeline, measuring 2.5ft in diameter, starts in Mumbai and ends in Solapur. It is a high-security pipeline which transports petrol, diesel and kerosene, and is equipped with sensors every kilometre. 
 
 According to the complaint, the culprits drilled a hole in the pipeline and plugged it with a locally made valve. They siphoned diesel through the valve. Police said 50,000 litres of diesel was stolen in just two days. The stolen fuel was valued at Rs3 lakh. 
 
 As per the HPCL official, the suspects endangered their lives and also the lives of local residents who live along the pipeline. â€œHad something gone wrong while puncturing the pipeline, it would have led to large-scale havoc, the official said. 
 
 The theft would have escaped notice had the Solapur and Loni Kalbhor units not noticed a drop in pressure. Also, the sensors indicated a leakage in the pipeline, and zeroed in on the leak. An inspection of the pipeline revealed the illegal valve.
 
 Police suspect the thieves were familiar with how the fuel is transported, and had information on the pipeline which enabled them to drill the hole.
