BENGALURU: Nearly 40 days after it was shut down following a wall collapse,   in   will be reopened on Sunday. BBMP on Saturday reinstated the mall’s occupancy certificate (OC), which it had withdrawn after the incident on January 16, which left two persons injured.

 A spokesperson from Mantri Developers said they received the certificate on Friday and the mall will start functioning from Sunday. “Some of the shopowners have already reoccupied their spaces and were ready to welcome shoppers on Saturday itself,” he added.
 
 MB  , additional director (town planning) BBMP, who’s also a member of the expert committee which probed the wall collapse, confirmed the development and said they have laid down certain conditions for the developer as well. “Firstly, the mall authorities should reconstruct the collapsed portion as per the committee’s recommendations. Right now, the collapsed portion has been repaired from inside. Till the external work gets over, we have asked the mall authorities to keep that portion closed for the public and also deploy security guards there,” he added.
 
 Thippanna said the mall authorities have been told to submit an yearly maintenance report. “We have told them to instal fire extinguishers at strategic locations. Also, they have to get a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire department. The certification should be renewed every two years and BBMP should be kept updated,” he added.
 
 The BBMP move comes following the submission of a site-incident report by the mall authorities, which declared the structure safe. The report pointed out that the structure has been withstanding live loads for the past seven years, especially during weekends and holidays.
