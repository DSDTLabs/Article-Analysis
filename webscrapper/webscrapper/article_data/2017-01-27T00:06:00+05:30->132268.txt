KOLHAPUR: The civic body will elect a new chief of the standing committee in a special meeting to be chaired by district collector Amit Saini on January 31. The last day for filing nominations is Friday. 

 It is a vital election as the standing committee plays an important role in major financial decisions of the civic body.
 
 The committee is currently held by   (NCP) corporator Murlidhar Jadhav. As per a post-civic poll agreement, it is the turn of the   now. The alliance holds majority in the standing committee. 
 
 The opposition alliance, Tararani Aghadi and   (BJP), are yet to disclose their candidate. However, considering their weak presence in the committee, they don’t have much chance.
 
 The committee has eight members each from the Congress and the NCP, while the Tararani-BJP alliance have seven members and the Shiv Sena has one. There is a possibility that like the last election, the Shiv Sena member may abstain from the election. 
 
 A Congress corporator said, “The civic panel chief is elected from among the members of the committee. We have two candidates,   and Rahul Mane for the post. The decision to nominate one of them will be taken in a meeting which will be attended by senior party leaders.”
