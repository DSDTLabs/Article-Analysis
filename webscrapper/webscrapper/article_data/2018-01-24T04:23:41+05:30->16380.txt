THANE: The   on Tuesday sentenced five men to   for the murder of   Sanjay Rokade at the   in July 2014. The court also censured the investigation officer from Naupada police station for “irresponsible investigation”.

 The ghastly murder was a fallout of a local gang rivalry and the five had assaulted him with sharp weapons around 6pm when he was driving along with a friend, Jayant Bhoir. Judge PR Kadam held all the accused—Mangesh Jadhav, Manish Jadhav, Nilesh Katate, Manoj Sonawane, and Ganesh Devadiga—guilty of the murder.
 
 “Rokade had purchased an Innova car and was driving towards a car accessories shop at the Teen petrol area when the accused smashed the windshield of his vehicle. Rokade confronted him and no sooner after he stepped out, they struck him with an iron rod resulting in his death. The impact of the hit was so hard that it tore open his skull and the brain was splattered all over on the car,” Sangita Phad, the government pleader told the court.
 
 The judge also came down heavily on Macchindra Thorve, now retired from police service, and said the investigation officer knowingly left loopholes so as to give the benefit to the accused. In his order, the judge directed the state police chief to initiate a disciplinary probe against Thorve, though he may have retired from service, and to initiate action against him.
 
 He said there was “intentional mischief to misdirect the probe as well to withhold the material evidences from the court. It cannot be considered a case of bonafide or unintentional omission of commission. It is not a case of faulty investigation but to ensure that suspect can go scot-free.”
 
 The judge added, “No doubt there are so many latches and lapses by investigating agency. However after perusal of entire evidence and charge sheet it appears that such latches and lapses are intentional and investigation officer has knowingly kept the latches to give benefit to accused.”
