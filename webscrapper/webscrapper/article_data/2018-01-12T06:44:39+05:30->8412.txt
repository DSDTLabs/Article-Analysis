PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Even after a year, no government agency or public sector company has come forward to take over a large chunk of prime land belonging to the sailing   ( ) in Pimpri.

 The 87.7 acres in question was approved for sale in December 2016 to meet the company’s net liabilities of Rs 821.17 crore, help in the waiver of government loans and interest amounting to Rs307.23 crore and the deferment of dues to the tune of Rs 128.68 crore. 
 
 Because of the liabilities, the roughly 1,100 HAL employees have not received their salaries for the last eight months. In this regard, the Hindustan Antibiotics Mazdoor Sangh, led by its general secretary Sunil Pataskar and vice-president  , met Union commerce minister   to ask for his help in reviving the company.
 
 The plight of the employees, who had gone without salary for nearly two-and-a-half years, was highlighted last year following which, through a Union cabinet-approved Rs100 crore loan, they received salary for 28 months. 
 
 The company had floated tenders for the sale of the land. The tenders also received an extension, but no government agency showed interest. 
 
 “The Syrian government had sent a proposal to the commerce minister for antibiotics and other medicines. Last week, met the minister on the proposal. The HAL the facilities necessary for production,” Pataskar said. 
 
 “If the production starts (at HAL), the company is likely to turn a profit,” Borhade said. 
 
 In September last, Maval MP Shrirang Barne, who is also the president of the employees’ union, met Union minister   in this regard. At the meeting, Kumar said the sale of land is the only option.
