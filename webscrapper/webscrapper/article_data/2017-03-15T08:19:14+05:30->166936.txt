PUNE: In due time, the   ( ) may see the appointment of a special Upalokayutka on the lines of   (BMC). The office holds bigger authority to deal with issues than the civic administration and will thus help dispose citizens’ grievances speedily. 

 “The authority is a must for Pune. It is needed for better functioning of the civic body. We are hopeful that it will be established soon,” said MP  , who has given a letter to the chief minister seeking to establish the authority.
 
 He said the state is positive about appointing the authority in Pune. It will get things moving at the civic administration without any misappropriation.
 
 The appointment will also help resolve grievances, which are to be taken up before the state government, at the city level.
 
 A Lokayukta is an authority before whom citizens can raise complaints against public servants. Currently, the state has only one such authority based in Mumbai. Complaints against ministers can also be lodged with the office. The   (deputy Lokayukta) will be a subdivision of the Lokayukata at the city level.
 
 “The state government's move to appoint an Upalokayukta in Mumbai has been welcomed. The move should be replicated at PMC as well,” said Vivek Velankar, of Sajag Nagrik Manch.
 
 He said that getting information from the civic administration is very tough. However, the new authority would help the case of activists like him. A body to keep watch on civic administration activities at the city level is required, he pointed out. It will help control the absolute power given to the commissioner’s office, he added.
