Panaji: The national council for educational research and training (NCERT), New Delhi, will be conducting the national achievement survey ( ) for Class X students on February 5. Students from 360 government and government aided schools across Goa will be participating in the survey, after the NCERT cleared their participation.

 The state government officials have instructed that all teachers be present on the day and ensure the smooth conduct of the examinations. 
 
 Usually, the NAS tests students in five subjects - mathematics, English, social sciences, science and modern Indian languages.
 
 From the academic year 2017-18, the NAS is to be held every year across the country. Till now, the NAS was being held once in three years by the NCERT. As a part of the survey, sample schools are chosen randomly from different states. From the NAS, it is expected to know what children of a chosen class should have learnt till that level of education and what has been the actual learning, and identify the gaps in learning.
