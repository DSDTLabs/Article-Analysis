CHARMINAR: It is barely a fortnight before the city welcomes the month of Ramzan.
Even as earthen bhattis are being readied at restaurants across the city to prepare the month's delicacy of haleem, a section of foodies are busy debating its etymology.
 
 Conversations at dinner tables in some homes and restaurants and between foodie groups revolve around what the dish should and should not be called.
 
 Should the status quo of haleem be continued or does the nomenclature need to be changed to daleem?
 There are very good and passionate arguments on both sides.
 
 Those who make a case for a rechristening of the delicacy say that haleem is the attribute of God and that it is disrespectful to name a food item after the Almighty .
 
 Others believe that the debate is unnecessary . Consider the case of  , who runs the   page   in Hyderabad. With a membership of over 12,000, the group is for those who are particular about consuming halal meat, but is also open to others who wish to join.
 
 “This debate is being reignited before Ramzan. Memes are being made in favour of renaming haleem. As a group admin, I don't interfere. But personally I feel that the debate is unnecessary ,“ he says.
 
 One such meme, which is doing the rounds on social media, reads thus: “Its daleem, not haleem. Please pronounce the name correctly ,“ after which it seeks to make a case that haleem is the name of God and that it should not be disrespected.
 
 Those in favour of a change in nomenclature claim that the daleem is derived from dalya, or oats, and therefore, should be renamed.
 
 “Apart from the disrespect angle, I see no other problem in calling it daleem,“ says M A  , a marketing executive.
 
 And as in the case with opinions, there are fence-sitters. M A  , an IT professinal, says, “Let people call it whatever they want. Haleem or daleem. As long as its well made, I have no problem.“
