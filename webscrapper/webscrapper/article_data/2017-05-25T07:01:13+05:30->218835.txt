PUNE: A 32-year-old woman allegedly assaulted her father-in-law with a heavy wooden plank after her husband told her to serve him rice for dinner at their residence in   near   around 9pm on Tuesday. 

 She later ran away from home, police said.
 
 The victim,   (60), who sustained serious head and back injuries, later lodged a complaint with the Hinjewadi police against his daughter-in-law. 
 
 An offence punishable under Section 326 (causing grievous hurt by a dangerous weapon) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered. Senior police inspector Arun   said they were looking for the woman.
 
 Waykar said the woman had finished serving rice to her mother-in-law and her husband,  , when he told her to serve it to his father as well. 
 
 Instead of doing so, she left the dining area and went to the rear portion of the house. 
 
 "They were still eating when she returned with a wooden plank and assaulted the victim. She had not been provoked or goaded by the family," Waykar said.
 
 Godambe has been admitted to a hospital in Hinjewadi where he was reported to be out of danger.
 
  A search team that went to the woman's maternal house did not find her there. Other attempts to find her were futile.
