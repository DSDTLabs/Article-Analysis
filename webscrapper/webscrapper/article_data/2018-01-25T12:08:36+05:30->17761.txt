PATNA: The state   on Wednesday accused the   leadership of indulging in “cheap politics” by alleging that the saffron party and CM   had conspired against RJD president Lalu Prasad, who was convicted by a   court in Ranchi and served five-year sentence in the third case of the fodder scam on the day.

 State BJP president Nityanand Rai said Lalu was implicated and incarcerated in the fodder scam when H D   and I K   were the prime ministers.
 
 Further, Lalu had been convicted first when the   government led by PM   was at the Centre, Rai added. BJP functionaries, including health minister   and former MLA Rameshwar Chaurasia, also attacked the RJD for criticizing the BJP.
 
 They maintained that Lalu was reaping what he had sowed and, therefore, the RJD functionaries should respect the judiciary and the court order. Pandey said Lalu would be convicted in the remaining three other fodder scam cases as well, while his family members would also face trial for their omissions and commissions.
