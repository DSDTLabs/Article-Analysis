PUNE:The police late on Wednesday night arrested three men, including a bookie, for running a cricket betting racket in Pimpri. The suspects were taking ball-by-ball bets on Indian Premier League cricket matches.

 A team of cops, led by senior inspector  , recovered 18 cellphones, two laptops, an LCD TV and Rs4,370 in cash. “We have also seized three notebooks which contained the names of bettors, written in code,” Mugalikar said.
 
  (46) — who already has three cases of betting against him — Anil Darda (39) and   (40) were arrested under the Bombay Prevention of Gambling Act.
 
 Sub-inspector   received a tip that the three men were taking bets on Wednesday’s IPL game in a building at Shagun chowk in Pimpri. “We raided the spot around 10.30pm on Wednesday and arrested all three,” Mane said. “We are in the process of ascertaining how much money was involved, as there were no cash transactions. It was all done online,” Mane said.
 
 The trio would watch the match on TV, and take ball-by-ball bets from customers over the phone. 
 
 Modus operandi
 
 Investigations have revealed that the trio ran the racket since the IPL started, and would change location every day to avoid getting caught by the police. They would even park their vehicles far away and walk to the spot to avoid detection.
 
 2nd in a week
 
 This was the second instance of a betting operation getting busted since the 10th season of the IPL began. The Bharati Vidyapeeth police, late on Sunday (April 9), raided a farmhouse along the   highway in Jambhulwadi, and arrested four men for running a betting ring. Six cellphones, one LCD TV, a set top box and Rs1,500 in cash were recovered. 
 
 Cops vigilant
 
 A senior crime branch officer told TOI that the crime branch and the city police force is collecting information about betting rackets in the city. “We are also keeping watch on city-based bookies,” the officer said, urging anyone with pertinent information to come forward.
