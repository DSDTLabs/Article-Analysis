NEW DELHI: An   has been registered against   MLA from Karnataka   on charges of delivering a   in Belagavi, during which he said about the upcoming Karnataka polls that "this election is about Hindus vs Muslims".

 
 
 Speaking at a campaign meeting in Sulebhavi village four days ago, Patil, MLA from Belagavai, said the assembly election is not a fight for good roads, drains and drinking water but a war between Hindus and Muslims. A video of his speech has gone viral on social media.
 
 Patil further said those who want Babri Masjid and Tipu Jayanti can follow Congress, while those who want Shivaji can vote for the BJP. Patil has often courted controversy with his rabble-rousing speeches. 
 
  "India is a Hindu country and there must be a Ram Mandir. I am committed to the construction of the Ram Mandir. Let Congress candidate Laxmi Hebbalkar make clear her stand on Ram Mandir. If she tells she is committed to it, I too will vote for her. If you vote for the Congress, they will only build Babri Masjid," Patil told the crowd.
 
 Congress candidate Hebbalkar said it's obvious that Patil is playing the Hindutva card as he has nothing to say about development and has done nothing for the constituency for 10 years.
