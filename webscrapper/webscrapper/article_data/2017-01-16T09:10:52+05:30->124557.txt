AHMEDABAD: It was a shocking sight for  , 29, a resident of Gota, and his friend Amrat Parmar, 23, when a youth driving a scooter collapsed a few feet away from them on Sabarmati Riverfront road near   at 1.30pm on Saturday. 

 Ashwin and Amrat were there to see the festivities. The duo rushed to the youth, later identified as Harsh Oza, 23, residing in a society near Dharnidhar Derasar, and checked that he was bleeding profusely from his neck.
 
 A thread was wrapped around Harsh’s neck which had made a deep cut, cutting his windpipe as was revealed later.
 
 “We didn’t know what to do but I immediately removed my shirt and got both our handkerchiefs right on the bleeding neck and tied the shirt in an attempt to stop the bleeding. We parked his scooter and tried to call EMRI 108 when we were told that it would take some time for them to reach due to heavy rush. We mustered all our courage and took Harsh on my scooter as I drove it, Amrat sat in the back, taking Harsh in between to the VS Hospital, clearing the traffic,” narrated Ashwin.
 
 Harshendu Oza, Harsh’s father, told TOI that it was only the duo’s presence of mind that saved his son. 
 
 “He has got 110 stitches and an operation was performed to stitch his windpipe together. If it were not the youths, I don’t know what would have happened to my son. He has been shifted to   on Sunday and is recuperating,” he said.
 
 The duo not only held ground till Harsh’s family reached VS Hospital and handed over his belongings but also ensured that his scooter, parked near the riverfront, also returned to the family on Sunday. 
 
 Ashwin said that they would keep in touch with Harsh’s family to check on his health. This indeed is a city of angels!
