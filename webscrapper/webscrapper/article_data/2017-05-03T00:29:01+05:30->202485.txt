Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh Congress on Tuesday launched a “pol khol” (expose) campaign from Budhni, the assembly constituency of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, to highlight the alleged large-scale corruption, irregularities in government welfare schemes and illegal mining under the BJP regime in the state.

 ​Addressing a gathering, MPCC​ president Arun Yadav alleged that the BJP was involved in large-scale irregularities and corruption for the last 13 years while its policies are not in the interests of the common people. Congress has launched a state-wide campaign to expose this through ‘pol khol chaupal’. “The BJP leaders were involved in illegal sand mining on the banks of Narmada and other rivers, illegal felling of trees in protected forests and their transportation. The party will expose involvement of leaders in black marketing, irregularities committed in Vyapam and Ujjain Simhastha, Rs 2,200-crore Katni hawala case, Rs 1,500-crore toilet scam, atrocities on marginalised community, exploitation of poor, farmers and women,” he said.
 
 Leader of opposition Ajay Singh and state general secretary Chandrika Prasad among others attended the rally. The party will continue the campaign in other districts till assembly elections 2018, said the leaders.
