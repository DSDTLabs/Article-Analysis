KOLKATA: The collapse of a portion of cornice at the century-old   near Sukeas Street on Sunday has brought the rickety state of the city’s one of the oldest privately held markets under lens. With the owners unable to carry out restoration due to funds crunch, the dilapidated market is not only staring at an uncertain future but also posing threat to passers-by.

 
 A portion of the cornice of a flat on the third floor of   market collapsed on Sunday morning, injuring five persons, including a vegetable vendor. While injuries of four pedestrians were not severe, the vendor —Butan Das — suffered severe injuries on his arms and shoulder. “It was around 9.30am when a huge piece of concrete fell from above. Butan, who was sitting in front of me with vegetables, cried in pain. Before I could figure out what exactly had happened, I saw him bleeding profusely,” recounted  , who runs a flower shop on the pavement that leads to Mahendra Srimani Market.
  
  
 
 
 Inside the market, rusted iron rods jut out from places where plasters have chipped away.   only reveal the sorry state of the building. Nobody could remember when the last repair was carried out. A source said owners of nearly 150 shops inside the market, once a hit among the shoppers of north Kolkata, did occasional repairs of their shops. But they later passed on the responsibility to the owner of the market.   — grandson of Mahendra Srimani — did not try to hide his inability to bear maintenance expenses.
 
 
 “What has happened on Sunday morning is unfortunate. But with the revenue that we earn from the market, it’s difficult to pay the electricity bills and other maintenance charges,” the octogenarian said. “While shop owners pay Rs 300 per month on an average, residential units pay a rent of Rs 800-Rs 1,200 per month,” he added.
