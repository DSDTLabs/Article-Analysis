KOLKATA: Two days before filing his nomination for the   as Trinamool Congress’ candidate,   MLA from Sabong   Bhuiyan submitted his resignation to Bengal assembly speaker Biman Banerjee.

 The resignation of this six-time MLA ended a nearly year-long controversy after Bhuiyan joined Trinamool in September 2016 but retained his Congress MLA post. Congress not only appealed to the speaker for his expulsion, but also moved court. Sources in the assembly said Banerjee wished him well and told him to work for Bengal.
 
 “This is the end of a more than 50-year-long relationship with Congress. I sent my resignation along with my wife’s to Sonia Gandhi and then I resigned from Bidhan Sabha at 1.55pm. I was hurt by the way some Congress leaders treated me and forced me to leave the party. It was Mamata Banerjee who put her faith in me. However, I shall continue to work for the people of Sabong as long as I live,” an emotional Bhuiyan told TOI over the phone.
 
 After the assembly polls, this Sabong lawmaker was mired in controversy. He was accused of being involved in the murder of Trinamool worker Joydeb Jana, who was killed just before the elections in April 2016. Later, his name was dropped from the chargesheet. Bhuiyan’s decision to continue as chairman of the public accounts committee defying party leadership also created controversy.
