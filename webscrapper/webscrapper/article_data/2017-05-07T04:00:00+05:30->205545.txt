Vadodara: After advising people to stay away from illegal slaughter and sale of meat, the minority community in Godhra has gone a step further. 

 Management of several community halls in the town are now insisting that beef should not be served in any function. They have put up signboards outside their commmunity halls stating this.
 
 The boards declaring this have been placed prominently at two such halls in the town. The boards state that since beef was banned, its use in the kitchen was not allowed. They add that the person booking the halls would be responsible for the consequences.
 
 According to sources, the boards were placed recently after the stricter cow protection law in the state as well as the strict stance adopted on cow slaughter in Uttar Pradesh by the newly elected government there. “The boards were placed to avoid any problems at the halls in wake of the new developments. While largely buffalo meat was used as beef, we decided to stop even this. If someone rakes up an issue, not only will the function get ruined, it may also vitiate the atmosphere,” said prominent minority leader Rafiq Tijoriwala.
 
 Tijoriwala pointed out that elders and community leaders had held meetings soon after the new act. 
 
 “We have ensured that the message percolates to the entire community. People have been asked not to use beef even if marriages are held at home,” Tijoriwala said.
 
 Dilu Haji, whose niece was married at one such community hall, said that the entire community had decided to abide by the law. “The boards ensure that people do not violate it,” he said. Another minority community member Yakub Mamji said that announcements to stick to the law were made even after prayers at mosques. 
 
 But he said that with even buffalo meat not available, many were finding it difficult to serve meat at weddings as mutton and chicken were costly.
