LUCKNOW: A group of   students protesting for the past six days in support of students' union elections renamed their agitation from ' ' to 'Chuppi Tod' on Saturday.

 The group highlighted 21 shortcomings of the university and called out to students to raise their voice against its “poor“ administration.
 
 The students visited all departments and distributed pamphlets questioning the university administration and asking students to raise voices against fee hike, late result declaration, the library not being open round the clock, lack of facilities like water and washrooms and lack of a women's grievances cell.
 
 Students said they would not end the protest until concrete steps were taken for elections. “There are elections for teachers and employees, why are only student elections withheld,“ said student Anurag Tiwari.
 
 Ashish Mishra, a student, shaved his head and sat in the protest barefoot. “I will not wear slippers till the university makes efforts to get the stay on elections vacated,“ said Mishra. He said the university did not want students' union elections so corruption could continue unabated there.
