 Officials say the lizards normally hibernate from November to March every year and require no extra food during that period. The lizards are not disturbed or checked on during the hibernation period and "pulling" them out caused them to go into shock.
 
 The postmortem reports of the lizards confirmed that they suffered a drastic temperature fluctuation in their body, which proved fatal. An inquiry has been launched by the zoo authorities to initiate action against the zoo ranger who is alleged to have pulled them out.
