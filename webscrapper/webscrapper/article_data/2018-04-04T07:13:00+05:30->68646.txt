GHAZIABAD: Fifteen more people were arrested on Tuesday in connection with Monday’s violence in the district during Dalit protests against what they claim is a dilution of a law protecting their rights, police said. On Monday, 30 people were arrested across Ghaziabad and all of them were sent to judicial custody by a court.

 On Tuesday also, there was a huge deployment of police personnel across strategic locations of the city, including the district collectorate, railway stations, bus terminals and government offices, in order to avoid a rerun of the   that had taken place a day earlier.
 
 Police said strict vigilance was kept on criminal elements who have track records of instigating mobs in the past to organise protests. Schools and colleges across the district also remained closed on Tuesday as a precautionary measure to ensure safety of students.
 
 Police said 12 separate FIRs have been registered in various police stations of the district pertaining to the vandalism by the agitators. A total of 285 persons have been identified and named as accused in the FIRs, up from 100 that had been named till Monday.
 
 “We are trying to identify more persons on the basis of CCTV footages at our disposal. Sections pertaining to attempt to murder have also been invoked against some accused in FIRs registered in Kavi Nagar and Vijay Nagar police stations. These are the two areas where vandalism had been at its peak on Monday,” Ghaziabad SP (City) Akash Tomar told TOI.
 
 “CCTV footages from others areas are also being examined,” he said, adding that those arrested have been charged mainly under   sections that pertain to rioting, prohibiting government servants from discharging their duties and for destroying government property.
