AHMEDABAD: A consumer court has awarded compensation of Rs 1 lakh each in three different cases as clients took travel agents to court over false promises of providing work visa for the USA.

 The court has asked Bharuch-based travel company   Tours & Travels and its owner couple Ibrahim and Nurjahan Lotiya to pay compensation apart from refunding all payments made to them by their clients who later approached the court.
 
 In this case, the travel company published advertisements in newspapers in 2013 that it would arrange working visas for people desirous to work in countries like Panama, Mexico, Sourth Africa and US. 
 
 Nearly 50 persons approached the company and some of them even made payments towards air tickets and charges of work visas. When the travel agents failed to secure visa and air tickets, a criminal complaint was lodged by one of the victims,   in Bharuch, who accused the couple of criminal conspiracy, forgery and cheating. It was alleged that the travel firm had supplied bogus tickets and work visas to some of its clients.
 
 The FIR accused the couple of duping various clients of total Rs 56.25 lakh. Police even recovered some amount from the accused persons.
 
 Three of the clients moved the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Bharuch district. Mayur Rana complained that he had paid Rs 10 lakh to the travel firm. Mintu Patel from Navsari had paid Rs 8.75 lakh and Bharuchâ€™s Sharad Jadav said that he had paid Rs 13.5 lakh to the couple. All three were desirous to go to the USA for work. They had been promised air tickets to Newark and work visa for US.
 
 All three demanded compensation for cheating and deficiency of service on part of Four Seasons. The consumer court gave the couple an opportunity to hire a lawyer for their defence, but they could not manage it on the ground that they were then lodged behind bars. 
 
 After granting some time, the court closed their right for hearing.
