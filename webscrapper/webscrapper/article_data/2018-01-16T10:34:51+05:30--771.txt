PANAJI: With   (GIDC) approving the transfer of the industrial plot to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited’s (HAL),   MRO (HE-MRO), the joint venture formed between French aerospace firm   will now setup the necessary infrastructure at the plant in  , said chairman and managing director of HAL, T Suvarna Raju.

 Aeronautical engineers of HE-MRO have already begun servicing helicopters used by the three Armed Forces in forward operating bases. “We have started catering to client needs at forward bases. The joint venture itself would be attending to the issues in the forward area by themselves,” Raju said. “They had an opportunity to attend to the requirements abroad.”
 
 HAL and Safran Helicopter Engines will each invest Rs 21.25 crore at the initial stage to start the maintenance and repair facility since each firm has a 50:50 stake in the joint venture. As per the initial strategy, the repair facility will provide maintenance repair and overhaul services for Safran TM333 and HAL Shakti engines installed on HAL-built helicopters. Once operational, HE-MRO will repair 50 helicopter engines each year, ramping up to 150 engines in the near future, Safran Helicopter Engines said in a statement issued earlier. HE-MRO is expected to have 100 employees and was meant to start is repair activity at the Honda plant in 2018.
 
 Sources say that it could now take as many as 12-18 months to set up the maintenance, repair and overhaul facility at Honda. After the formation of the joint venture, HE-MRO engineers were recruited, trained and certified by Safran helicopter engines. Due to the procedural delay in transferring the land at Honda industrial estate, the HE-MRO began operations from Bengaluru.
 
 Manufacturing of helicopter engines and assembling of engines may happen at the Honda facility later, said Raju.
