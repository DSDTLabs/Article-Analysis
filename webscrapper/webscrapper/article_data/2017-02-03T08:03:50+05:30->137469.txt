The chief executives of India’s largest technology companies will head to Washington this month to argue against US President Donald Trump’s envisioned tightening of visa programmes. The CEOs would meet officials and lawmakers on February 20 to try and dissuade the president from raising requirements under the 
  , said R Chandrashekhar, Nasscom chief. 

 TCS and Infosys depend on the system to insert foreign talent on the ground to work with US clients. Trump is believed to be 
  aimed at overhauling work visa programmes. 
 
 Visa restrictions can transform the way US firms like Apple and Indian corporations such as Wipro recruit, to offset a dearth of homegrown US engineering talent. Businesses will then have to try to hire American first and if they opt for foreign workers, priority will be given to the most highly paid — making hiring more expensive. 
 
 “We want to put across to the new administration and the lawmakers what would be lost by America closing those doors,” said Chandrashekhar, who will join the delegation on a four-day visit to the US. Nasscom has already shared its concerns with its own government. “We are parallelly pursuing our own course of action.” 
 
 Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat, introduced a bill last week to tighten requirements for the   work visa programme. Senior executives are putting together contingency plans in the event they can’t get enough workers into the US to work with their clients. The topic may come up during a conversation between PM Narendra Modi and Trump slated for June. “The reality is far more complex than making changes to the 85,000 H-1B visa programme.”
