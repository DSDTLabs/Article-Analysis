GUWAHATI: Mass protests erupted in Assam three days after NSCN-IM general secretary and its chief negotiator in peace deals with the Centre,  , said the August 2015 'framework agreement' recognizes NSCN(I-M)'s demand for territorial integration of all Naga-inhabited areas in the region. 

 The Naga group proposes to carve a 'Greater Nagalim' by joining large tracts of land in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and parts of Myanmar where there are Naga inhabitants. The outfit also claims that Assam's Karbi Anglong and   districts along with parts of Golaghat, Sivasagar, Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, and Jorhat districts.
 
 Chief minister   said, "There is no such proposal with the central government. We are committed to protecting Assam's territory." But Sonowal's two predecessors - Prafulla Kumar Mahanta and   - have demanded that the centre make the content of the framework agreement public to remove all doubts.
 
 "Nagaland has already encroached upon land in Assam and a case is pending with the Supreme Court. Now, there is no question of giving more land to Nagaland," said Mahanta. Gogoi said, "The Centre must make provisions so that Assam's territorial integrity is not comprised under any circumstances."
 
 General secretary of All Assam Students Union Lurinjyoti Gogoi said, "Any Naga agreement where Assam's territorial integrity is compromised with cannot be accepted." People living in Golaghat district bordering Nagaland staged protests against the NSCN-IM and burnt effigies of the Prime Minister and the chief minister.
