MADURAI: Divya  , an independent filmmaker known for her documentary ‘Kakkoos’, was arrested by police on Tuesday and produced before a judicial magistrate court.

 Police said the arrest was made to execute the orders of a judicial magistrate court as she had failed to appear before it in a case relating to a students’ protest, which took place in 2009. 
 
 Nizam, a former student representative, was also arrested with her. However, both were released on conditional bail. Bharathi, 28, an activist, was one of the accused in the 2009 student protest following the death of a college student   in the government hospital.
