CHENNAI: The number of temporary drivers engaged to run   buses dropped by over a third on Monday and the government began exerting pressure on the striking employees by sending “messages” to their families. 

 MTC claimed 1,701 buses (53 %) were operated even when only 192 temporary drivers were employed and 2,600 notices were issued to employees who abstained from work. 
 
 On their part, the striking employees, owing allegiance to the   and CITU, occupied most seats in the buses that were operated and stopped commuters from entering. Some were allegedly drunk. 
 
 Some workers who protested at   said they would operate fleets free (without selling tickets) if the government continued to force them to give up the protest. 
 
 Unlike on Sunday, there was additional rush on the first day of the week and suburban trains and metro rail services came to the rescue again. 
 
 There were a few incidents of stone pelting on buses. Near Natarajapuram in the suburbs, masked men on motorcycles hurled stones at a bus and fled. “Netaji, a temporary driver who was at the wheel, was hurt. We are yet to identify the culprits,” a police officer said. Another bus was similarly attacked near   by motorcycle-bound men, nut none was hurt. Police filed FIRs in both incidents.
 
 The demand for share autorickshaws was high, particularly during peak hours, in Koyambedu, Guindy, Nungambakkam, Central Station and   bus terminus. The few buses operated during this period were packed. 
 
 “We are optimistic many will join work on Tuesday as the HC has clearly said the public is getting affected. Departmental action would be initiated on absentees depending on the situation,” an MTC official added.
 
 Besides, the uncertainty over ticket reservation for Pongal special buses caused heartburn among commuters. A total of 27,000 specials were to be operated in the second week of January.
