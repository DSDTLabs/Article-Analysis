AHMEDABAD: No wonder most   registered under POCSO (The  ) result in acquittals. A  , who investigated one such case told a   on Friday that he did not have any idea about the “full form” of POCSO.

 Aniruddhsinh Parmar, 59, who was a police inspector with Shehrkotda police station and is now retired, said, “I think POCSO is sexual life saving.” The former investigator of the POCSO case told the court so after having put in 22-23 years of service with the police department in 2015, when he was probing the case under POCSO.
 
 Parmar entered the witness box before additional sessions judge A A Nanavati as the investigator of the case for deposition. During his cross-examination by advocate Anand Brahmbhatt, Parmar said that he was well acquainted with IPC, CrPC, Evidence Act and Police Manual. He did not have any idea about which section of the   gives police the power to investigate a crime.
 
 During his questioning, Parmar further said that POCSO Act can be invoked in a case where the girl is below 15 years, but later changed his version and said that the girl should be below 17 years of age.
 
 The investigator also said during his cross-questioning that the rape survivor’s birth certificate was not verified, nor did he seek a doctor’s opinion about the girl’s age when she was sent for medical examination. He did not peruse the medical certificate issued by doctors. He did not even write the case diary himself.
 
 Parmar’s is not the first case in which a cop does not know the full form of POCSO. Last year, a DSP, Dharmendra Desai, stated before the city sessions court that he did not know when the POCSO Act was introduced, and what the full form of POCSO was.
