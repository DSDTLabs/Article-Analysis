ISLAMABAD: After 
  of more than 100 terrorism suspects in the past two years, some Pakistani politicians are pushing back against the opaque courts in a rare sign of backbone against the nation's powerful military. The courts were set up about a month after Pakistani   massacred more than 100 schoolchildren in December 2014.

 The military's closed door proceedings have drawn ire from human rights organisations and admiration for swift rulings in a country where civilian courts are clogged. Investors have also noted Pakistan's improved security since a militant crackdown. However, 
  , is facing off emboldened politicians in a bid to continue the secret courts.
 
 As their mandate expired earlier this month, the government has yet to commit to an extension and opposition politicians openly object to it. The tussle will likely increase strains between the two branches of power in the nuclear-armed nation. 
 
 The military said earlier this month the courts have "yielded positive effects" and Bajwa's predecessor, retired General  , told a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week that they had stopped insurgents.
 
 "Freedom of speech and other things like human rights and all, they are limitations and they are difficult to handle when you are dealing with hardcore terrorists," said Raheel Sharif. 
 
 Yet the biggest opposition parties have objected to their reinstatement. Parliamentary leaders and opposition parties are due to meet and decide the fate of the military courts on January 31.
