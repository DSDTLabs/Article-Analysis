We had earlier told you that actor   is gearing up to do yet another Tamil project, with debutant filmmaker Ra Karthik. It was speculated that the film has travel as one of its main elements. 

 Karthik says, “Travel-based movies are very rare in Tamil and I guess we can call this film the first travelogue movie of its kind in the industry. It’s based on an interesting and scenic road trip, and is quite a feel-good film too.” However, the filmmaker says it’s too early to talk about Dulquer’s character or any other aspect of the film.
 
 The director adds that the film should go on floors this year. “I have met Dulquer and the shoot should start this year if all goes well, but the dates are yet to be finalised.” The film is also scripted by Karthik himself. The rest of the artistes and technicians will also be finalised soon, he adds.
 We have also reliably learnt that Dulquer will be taking up yet another Tamil project by a debutant director this year. In Malayalam, the actor is also playing a key role in Soubin Shahir’s film Parava.
