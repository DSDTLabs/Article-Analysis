CHANDIGARH: 80% Rule For Promotion In BSc: Parties Not Settling For Special Chance, Varsity Not Ready To  
The decision to raise the   bar for promotion to the next class has not gone down well with the science students of Panjab University (PU).
 
 The choice-based credit system (CBCS) now requires them to have 80% credits as opposed to 50%--just the kind of excuse student parties were looking for early in the session to instigate some protest and expand their base. Earlier, their separate agendas kept them divided,while this year, they have found a common issue.
 
 Earlier this week, Panjab University Campus Students' Council president   had given an application to dean of university instructions (DUI)  , saying that since the majority of students had credits below 80%, the benchmark for promotion be reset to 50%.Around the same time, Indian Students' Association (ISA) also gave a memorandum to the vice-chancellor for a change of criterion.
 
 On Friday, the DUI issued fresh instructions for giving the students a special chance to fulfil the criterion by sitting another examination.“We have not diluted the rule about the 80% bar. We have requested all science departments to hold the tests again.We want to improve the quality of education and set our standards higher,“ Meenakshi Gupta said.
 
 On Friday, the   (SFS) also organised an open discussion on the subject. SFS activist Harman said notwithstanding the special chance to bridge the  , the decision to set the credit bar at 80% should be taken back. “Setting such a high benchmark for the promotion of first-year BSc (hons) students will break them under pressure before they even start their career,“ he said.
