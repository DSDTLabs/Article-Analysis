Udaipur: Taking a step ahead towards environment conservation and to ensure proper utilisation of funds, Mohanlal Sukhadia University (MLSU) has decided not to receive or felicitate guests with garlands or bouquets. 

 Instead they would be given plants and books as a token of gratitude and respect. MLSU vice-chancellor Prof J P Sharma has directed all affiliated colleges to follow the culture now on for events and functions organised in their departments. The idea was given to the V-C by students of the university's law college. 
 
 “Thousands of rupees are spent in colleges every year on garlands and bouquets as customary greetings to the guests who attend functions. We find this sheer wastage of money as the flowers are perishable and go waste within few hours,” said Sakshi Pandya, vice-president of the law college students’ union.
 
 In their memorandum, the students suggested to replace the garlands with plants that would not perish and grow into trees useful for the place wherever planted. The V-C was so impressed and touched by the idea that he immediately agreed to implement it and adding for a greater cause, he said the guests would also be given books as a token of gratitude. 
 
 “Universities stand for education and what better combination than plants and books as symbol of knowledge, awareness and sensitivity,” Sharma said. MLSU is perhaps the first university in the state to step out of age-old customary greeting practices and set a model for others to show responsiveness towards environmental concerns.
