NAGPUR: Functioning of NMC’s   officials has come under scanner after  , the private firm assigned to treat city garbage, failed to pay Rs1.64 crore fine imposed on it. Disclosing this in the   general body meeting, senior corporator Abha Pande claimed involvement of NMC officials who were going easy on the company. 

 Demanding an inquiry, Pande said health department had imposed a Rs1.64 crore fine on Hanjer for keeping its plant closed for 449 days between 2013 and 2015. She also alleged nexus between NMC officials and the company. “The fine was earlier imposed at the rate of Rs25,000 per day and then Rs50,000 per day,” she informed the House. As per calculations, the company was supposed to pay Rs5.40 crore. NMC reduced the fine amount and imposed only Rs1.64 crore for reasons not known. What’s more, NMC did not bother to collect even the reduced fine from Hanjer and instead paid the electricity bills that Hanjer should have paid, she revealed. 
 
 The company treated far less quantum of garbage than it was contracted to since the beginning. This forced residents to approach the   bench in Pune. In February 2012, NGT also imposed a fine of Rs20 lakh each on Hanjer and NMC for violating management of solid waste rules.
 
 While NMC paid the fine, the private company appealed in the   and obtained a stay. Even Maharashtra Pollution Control Board issued notices to both NMC and Hanjer for not treating waste. 
 
 Pande wondered how despite having lawyers who are paid lakhs of rupees every year, NMC had not approached higher court to have the fine stayed. 
 
 NMC was so lenient towards the company that it even provided it an excavator, she disclosed. Officials of Pench department failed to give satisfactory reply to the queries raised by Pande. At this, Mayor Nanda Jichkar asked the civic chief Ashwin Mudgal to conduct an inquiry into Pande’s allegations and submit a report in the next general body meeting.
