VIJAYAWADA: Poor inputs from Nuzvid and surrounding areas have hit the quality of mangoes being sold at Nunna market.

 Nunna market is the biggest mart for mangoes in  . It is known for exporting around 7,000 tonnes of Banginapalli, Chinna rasalu,   on a yearly-basis. The market, which usually starts operations by first week of March, is experiencing marginal sale this year.
 
 “Poor crops have dashed our hopes this year. We exported around 500 tonnes by this time last year, while we are unable to export 10 tonnes this year. Demand in the market is increasing every day but there is a huge gap in supply,” said Atluri Ramakrishna, a trader in Nunna.
 
 Many traders from other parts of the country are waiting for inputs from local farmers to export mangoes. “We are unhappy with the quality of crop this year. Limited stocks are arriving at local markets and traders are fighting to get it for the low rates. Fine quality Banginapalli costs Rs 1.2 lakh per tonne in the second week of March and now it has reduced to Rs 28,000 and we hope it will reduce further,” said Mangal Chand Singh, a trader from New Delhi.
 
 Farmers in Pathapadu, Nunna, Eedara and other villages blamed a delay in the crop season. “Mango crop got delayed for a month this year. We have noticed flowers in February and it made a huge impact on the crop. The quality of the crop became inferior with sooty mould infection, which has resulted in falling prices,” said  , a farmer.
