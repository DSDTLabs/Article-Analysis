The festival of colours can cause   to the eye and  . Eye specialists and dermatologists alike say people are often unaware and negligent of the problems that can occur when colour is applied wrongly or chemical colours are used.

 Dr Harshvardhan Ghorpade, cornea and cataract surgeon, Fortis Vashi said that care should be taken to avoid colour going into anyone's eyes. 
 
 “Wear protective glasses, if needed, and if colour gets into the eyes, wash your eyes thoroughly with clean water,” he said. However, if the eyes turn red, swollen or irritable, then the person should go to a doctor, he added.
 
 He advises using organic colours instead of chemical-based ones and not to mix mud or too much of colours. “Do not aim water balloons or any object at someone’s eyes. Children and older people's eyes are more sensitive to such chemicals, so they need to be extra careful,” he cautioned.
 
 Consulting cosmetic surgeon, Dr Mohan Thomas recommends olive or almond oil to be applied on the skin and moisturiser on the hands, face and other exposed parts of the body. 
 
 “Likewise, using dark nail polish is ideal. Vaseline on the lips and a thin film of foundation on the face can help prevent the colours from directly coming in contact with the skin and causing a lot of damage,” he said.
 
 Applying oil to the hair helps prevent it from drying out, said Dr Thomas. He also recommended egg to be applied to the scalp for 30 minutes and then washed with a good shampoo and conditioner. “Better still a hat or a cap will protect your hair from the strong chemical dyes,” he advised.
