 Junaid Ahmad, Country Director for India,World Bank, said, “It’s a powerful film and it should be screened at as many venues as possible.”
 Talking about the film, Nila said, “Kadvi Hawa is not the kind of a film which is about box office numbers. It’s the kind of a film which will be discussed. Between I Am Kalam and Kadvi Hawa, I have made so many films, but wherever I go people know me as I Am Kalam’s director. Kabhi kabhi mujhe aisa lagta hai ki maine koi kaam nahi kiya kya uske baad? I hope Kadvi Hawa will be remembered like I Am Kalam.” He added, “I have received requests from people who want to write research papers on the making of Kadvi Hawa.”
 Talking about the screenings, he said, “A number of screenings have been scheduled at different film festivals. I will be visiting   this month because the organisers of Karachi Film Festival have also contacted me to screen the film.”
