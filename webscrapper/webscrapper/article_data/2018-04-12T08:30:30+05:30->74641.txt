INDORE:   cell of state cyber police on Wednesday arrested a 19-year-old youth of Jharkhand for duping a man in Indore of Rs 50,000 by transferring it to an international wallet.

 Police had received a complaint from Vijay Nagar resident Anand Devliya that some unidentified person had made a transaction of Rs 50,000 from his credit card which was used internationally. 
 
 Police formed a team and the online wallets were traced. The team of cyber cell traced the account and identified a lady in Jharkhand Jyotsna Dangi. When the woman was questioned, cops learnt that her brother Deepak Kumar had made the transaction and deposited the money into her account. 
 
 When Deepak was questioned in this regard, he told police that he had found the details of the victim Devliya on Indian Complaint Forum – an online platform for registering complaints. 
 
 Devliya had posted a complaint on the forum saying that the transaction made by him at a retail outlet using his SBI credit card had failed and even then cash was deducted. Deepak took Anand’s email id, his name address, phone number and credit card number from the forum. 
 
 “He called Anand and told that he was speaking from the bank and asked for his email id password. He asked for the credit card details like expiry date and CVV. The victim also gave him the OTP number,” said cyber cell SP Jitendra Singh.
 
 After receiving all the details successfully from the complainant, the accused used the credit card to transfer the money into two online wallets in England and Singapore. He then transferred the money to his sister’s bank account. 
 
  Deepak’s family members told police that Deepak had always been inclined towards technical things and was fascinated by the cyber world. “He said that he wanted to be like Mark Zuckerberg and do something big in his life,” said Singh.
