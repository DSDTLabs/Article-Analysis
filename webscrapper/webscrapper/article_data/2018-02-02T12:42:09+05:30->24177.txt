KOHIMA: A 12-hour bandh called by the Core Committee of Nagaland Tribal Hohos and Civil Organisations (CCNTHCO) began in parts of Nagaland on Thursday amidst tight security. 

 The bandh has been called against an official notification for the February 27 assembly poll despite a general appeal for solution of the Naga political problem before the elections.
 
 While the bandh was being peacefully enforced in at least five districts, some tribal bodies decided not to support the it in six districts.
 
 The core committee said the decision to call the bandh was taken at a meeting of all the apex tribal hohos and mass-based organisations on January 29. The committee said in a release the decision was unanimously taken by all concerned and therefore it would go ahead as resolved.
 
 "The very purpose of this bandh is in pursuance of the resolutions adopted collectively that Nagas prefer to have solution first rather than election now," it said. Some apex tribal bodies, including   (APO), Eastern Nagaland Public Organisation (ENPO) and  , were not imposing the bandh.
 
 An APO statement had said on Wednesday no bandh would be allowed within Angami-inhabited areas and asked the people not to participate.
 
 ENPO leader   had said the organisation would not impose any bandh within its jurisdiction covering Mon, Tuensang, Kiphire and Longleng districts.
 
 The Lotha Hoho also decided not to support the bandh in Wokha district. Meanwhile, officials in the police and election department said elaborate security arrangements were in place to thwart any untoward incident.
