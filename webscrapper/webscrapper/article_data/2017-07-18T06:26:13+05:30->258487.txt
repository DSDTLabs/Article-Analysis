AHMEDABAD: The   — the scheme to provide subsidized meals to labourers — which was launched on an experimental basis at 83 hiring points for masons (kadiyanakas) will now be implemented in Ahmedabad, Surat, Rajkot, Gandhinagar, Bhavnagar, Vadodara, and Valsad.

 Chief minister   will inaugurate the scheme in Akhbarnagar kadiyanaka on Tuesday. Deputy chief minister   will launch the scheme in Kalol in Gandhinagar. Rupani will later address a gathering at the   convention centre.
 
 Rajiv Kumar Gupta, the principal secretary of the labour and employment department, said: “In all, 5.66 lakh labourers are registered with the labour board.” The scheme was initially launched at 83 kadiyanakas, Gupta said. “The menu has been changed based on labourers’ feedback,” he said. “Some reports suggested that people who are not labourers were queuing up for the meals. 
 
 We have, therefore, decided to serve food only after digitally checking registration numbers.” Gupta said 95% of registrations had been verified and all registrations would be verified in a couple off days.
 
 Labour and employment minister Dilip Thakore said that food was served to around 25,000 labourers daily during the trial period. He said the government was exploring the possibility of implementing the scheme across the state. “If we find an agency that meets all norms, we will implement the scheme in all nagarpalikas,” he said. He said that funds for the scheme had been allocated by the state government.
