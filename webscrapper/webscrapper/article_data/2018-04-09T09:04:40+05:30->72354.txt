PATNA: The   Teachers’ Association (MUTA) has urged governor-cum-chancellor   and CM   to order withdrawal of the FIR lodged by the Patna district education officer (DEO)   with Bahadurpur police station against 114 college teachers for their failure to turn up at seven different evaluation centres in the city to evaluate Intermediate answer sheets.

 “Lodging of an FIR against the college teachers by a junior officer is a direct attack on the autonomy of the university. Besides, the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) never discusses availability of teachers with the respective institutions before evaluation of answer sheets. The Board also does not send appointment letters to teachers,” MUTA president A K   said.
 
 He added the association also demanded setting up of ‘citizen charters’ at the university level so that the university fixes a deadline to address various problems of serving and retired teachers. “The university has not been able to make payment of retiral benefits to teachers due to prevailing red tapism in the office. Unless teachers move the court, their retiral benefits and arrear payments are not paid by the university,” Thakur said, adding some retired teachers, who could not cope with the stress, had died leaving their pension, gratuity and other benefits unpaid.
 
 Meanwhile,  , a senior economics teacher at B D College, Patna, said the teachers would move the Patna high court on Monday seeking quashing of the FIR lodged against them. “Teachers have no faith in the district administration. They will move court to seek justice,” he said.
 
 Some women teachers, who have been named in the FIR, said they were living a tensed life now. “We apprehend that the police might arrest us. We are left with no other option but to move court,” one of them said.
