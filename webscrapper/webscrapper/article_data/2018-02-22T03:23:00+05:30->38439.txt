Vijayawada: A second-year degree student was cheated of Rs 1.6 lakh by online fraudsters. Annavarapau Krupalatha, a native of Garikaparru, received a message on her cellphone saying that her mother had won a lottery of Rs 5 crore, and asked her to contact on the phone number mentioned in the message.

 Unaware of the trap, Krupalatha dialled the mobile number, and the fraudsters made her believe that the money would be transferred to her account if she provided bank details along with identity and address proofs. She submitted all the details on the email address given by the fraudsters.
 
 Later, she was asked to pay Rs 22,800 towards processing fee, which she paid. Some time later, she was told to transfer Rs 78,000 towards taxes, and another Rs 59,200 towards expenses. She deposited all the amounts into three different accounts provided by the fraudsters. When there was no response from them for a long time, she grew suspicious, and dialled the phone numbers, but were unreachable. When she realised she was cheated, Krupalatha filed a complaint with the police.
 
 Sub-inspector of Thotlavalluru police station, K Prasad registered a case. “With the help of the cybercell, we found the bank accounts in which Krupalatha deposited the amount are located in Delhi and Kolkata. We are trying to locate the perpetrators by establishing their identities,” said Prasad.
 
 He said people should not believe the messages they receive on mobile phones claiming they have won a lottery. They should also not provide account details, CVV numbers of debit, credit cards, and OTP numbers to anyone. Prasad said they should also not entertain people who call up saying they are bank employees and ask for account details.
