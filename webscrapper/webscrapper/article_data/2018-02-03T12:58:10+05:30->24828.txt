BHOPAL: BJP veteran   has joined a protest by farmers against the proposed   plant in Gadarwada in MP's Narsinghpur district, and the state government's Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana. 

 Talking to TOI over phone from Narsinghpur, Sinha said he stands by his demand, and refused to meet the chief minister in this regard. "The issue has been raised from time to time, and the state government was in the know of it," said the former Union minister.
 
 The former finance minister has been sitting in dharna outside the collectorate for more than 24 hours now, braving the night chill. Sinha, who has come out in the open against BJP's policies in the Centre and states, had joined a similar protest by farmers of Gadarwada tehsil of Narsinghpur o January 12 and given a memorandum to the district administration.
 
 Sinha arrived in Narsinghpur on February 1 for the dharna outside the office of the collector. "The protest was already on (when Sinha joined). Earlier, Sinha and the farmers had given a memorandum, demanding jobs for farmers whose land was acquired for the NTPC plant, compensation under   for crop damage. They also demand that Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana should not be implemented," collector Abhay Kumar Verma told TOI.
