PATNA: The special investigation team (SIT) probing the   (BSSC)   scam will quiz the static magistrate, who was deployed at the AVN School centre for the second phase of examination on February 5, said SIT chief and SSP (Patna) Manu Maharaaj on Saturday.

 “The official would be asked how the question paper seal was broken hours before the start of examination and why he did not report it to the higher authorities about the leak. The SIT will also check how a disaffiliated school (AVN) was made the examination centre,” the SSP said and added that some other officials, including the patrolling magistrate, would also be quizzed in this connection. The state government cancelled the five-phase examination conducted for appointment of Intermediate-level clerical staff.
 
 The February 5 paper was leaked from AVN School on WhatsApp. School proprietor/director   was arrested in the case. BSSC chairman Sudhir Kumar, an IAS officer of 1987 batch, along with his three family members and two other persons were arrested on Thursday night in the paper leak case. Sudhir was sent to Phulwarisharif jail on Friday night.
 
 “Topper scam accused Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh’s call detail records will also be reinvestigated as he had links with Anand Barar, the Delhi-based evaluator of BSSC papers. Barar is evading arrest,” the SSP added.
 
 The SIT also interrogated Ahmedabad-based printing press owner   and its manager Ajay Kumar, who are on transit remand till February 27. They were arrested in Ahmedabad on February 22.
 
 It is yet not known if any video recording of question booklets’ transportation and opening of their seals at the examination centre was made as per the BSSC order.
