NEW DELHI: In an effort to bring down the maternal and child mortality rate, PM   announced a scheme to provide pregnant   who undergo institutional delivery and vaccinate their children a financial aid of Rs 6,000.

 The scheme, which will be floated across 650 districts of the country, will provide   Rs 6,000 towards covering hospital admission, vaccination and nutritional food,   said. The money will be directly transferred to the bank accounts of pregnant women.
 
 The maternity benefit scheme is aimed at encouraging institutional deliveries in order to reduce maternal as well as infant mortality.
 
 PM’s announcement assumes significance as India accounts for 17% of all maternal deaths in the world. The country’s maternal mortality rate is pegged at 167 per 1,00,000 live births, whereas infant mortality is estimated at 43 per 1,000 live births. Among the primary causes of high maternal and infant mortality are poor nutrition and inadequate medical care during pregnancy and childbirth.
 
 The maternity benefit scheme was initially launched in 2010 on pilot basis for implementation in 53 districts with the benefit amount being Rs 4,000. This was in fact the first central government scheme to provide maternal benefit to women as wage compensation under Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana (IGMSY). The scheme provided conditional cash transfer to pregnant women above the age of 18 years for up to two live births.
 
 Later in 2013, IGMSY was amended to cater to the National Food Security Act, recognising food and nutritional needs of pregnant women. The cash entitlement was also increased by the ministry of women and child development to Rs 6,000.
 
 Even though the benefit was to become universal and provided in all districts in the country from the date of NFSA coming into place, the scheme could not be expanded in the absence of adequate budgetary allocations.
