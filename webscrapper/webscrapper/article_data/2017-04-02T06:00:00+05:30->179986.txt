Kolkata: CISF stopped stamping baggage tags at Kolkata and six other airports in the country from Saturday, but the practice did not cease altogether. A low-cost carrier was seen using its own stamp to keep a check on the cabin bag count.

 Flyers travelling by SpiceJet were surprised when the ground staff at the check-in desk handed them cabin bag tags with the ‘OK to board’ stamp. “I thought the days of stamping and tags were over, but old habits die hard.   have found a new reason to hand us tags and stamp them,” remarked  , a passenger. 
 
 A SpiceJet official said the airline had been following the practice for quite some time to keep a track on the number of cabin bags that passengers declared at the check-in desk. “Many a times, passengers say they are carrying only one cabin bag, but actually have two or three while boarding. If we see that there are bags without the stamped tags, they will be taken from the passengers and put in the luggage hold. This is to prevent over-crowding of the overhead luggage racks,” the official explained.
 
 At present, all airlines allow passengers on the economy class to carry a bag weighing up to 7kg in the cabin. An additional bag is allowed if the flyer has a laptop. Women can also carry a purse. Those flying business class have more cabin allowance.
 
 On Saturday, there were several queries about the no-stamping rule when Air India and   stopped issuing baggage tags and the airlines’ staff had to brief passengers that they were not required. 
 
 Last year, security regulator Bureau of Civil Aviation Security, asked CISF to conduct projects at airports and ultimately declared that tag-stamping be stopped in metro airports to save time.
