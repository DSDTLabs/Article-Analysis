AHMEDABAD: Highlighting the importance of innovations, the director of   (AIM) and additional secretary of Niti Aayog, R Raman, said that we need the youth of our country to become job creators and this cannot happen without innovation. 

 He was present at the eighth edition of Gujarat Innovation Awards, organized on Tuesday evening by   in Ahmedabad . CM Vijay Rupani was also present as the chief guest along with minister of state, revenue, Kaushik Patel, who was the guest of honour.
 
 Speaking further about the initiatives undertaken under AIM, Raman said, “You need to have a problem-solving mindset to innovate. As part of AIM, we’re trying to create an innovation-entrepreneurship ecosystem at the national, state, industry, NGO and individual level. Some of the best doctors and engineers in the US are Indians and the reason why we couldn’t achieve this in India is the lack of innovation-entrepreneurship ecosystem.”
 
 CM Rupani also highlighted the startup policy that has been formed by the state government, in a bid to support and encourage entrepreneurship and innovations. 
 
 “In this year’s budget, we’ve allocated Rs 200 crore for the startup policy. Through our initiatives, we’re trying to identify startups and see how the government can help fund their ideas and innovation into a product/ service that can be marketed,” said Rupani.
 
 “The GIS initiative is useful in achieving this goal. We hope that such initiatives encourage the youth to solve existing problems faced by the people through innovation,” he added.
 
 Some 17 people were rewarded for their innovations at the awards ceremony.  , founder chairman, GIS, said, “There’s an upswing in the field of innovation in India. We have jumped to the 60th spot in global innovation index from 66th in 2016, and this is an encouraging trend. It inspires us to take our work beyond Gujarat and connect with all innovators of India on a larger platform.”
