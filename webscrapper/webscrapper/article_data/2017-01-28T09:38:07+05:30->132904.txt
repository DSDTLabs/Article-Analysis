THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The CPM’s conspicuous dithering on the student agitation against Kerala Law Academy’s management, reportedly because of its close ties to the latter, has earned it the ire of CPI, its principal coalition partner. It has also provoked former chief minister and CPM veteran   to come down heavily on the  .

 Though CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan chose to dismiss the increasingly violent agitation as just another “campus agitation’’, the state executive of CPI that met here upped the ante by declaring full support to the   and urged student leaders not to withdraw from the strike until the principal of the college Lekshmi Nair is removed from the post. All opposition parties too are united in their demand for action against the management and removal of the principal.
 
 “The demands of the students are reasonable and hence the government should take action on it. There is no justification for the delay in taking action,’’ Achuthanandan said. The BJP has decided to go ahead with the hunger strike observed by its former state president V Muraleedharan indefinitely in front of the college campus. 
 
 Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan was not ready to comment on the agitation when the media approached him.
