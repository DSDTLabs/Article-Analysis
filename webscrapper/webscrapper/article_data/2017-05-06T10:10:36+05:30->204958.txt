BHOPAL: Madhya   government on Friday dismissed an application moved by Guna additional district magistrate (ADM) Niyaz Ahmed Khan for allowing him to stay in jail with gangster  .

 Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) members staged a demonstration in Guna appealing to the state government to reject his application.
 
 “Today, he wants to meet Salem, tomorrow he would ask permission to go to Pakistan for writing a book on Dawood Ibrahim and his girlfriend,” said Pramod Bhargav, VHP district secretary in Guna.
 
 The organisation has threatened to hold a statewide protest if Khan’s application was processed for sanction. 
 
 Khan had created a flutter among top bureaucrats and law enforcement agencies in the state by seeking permission to spend a month with underworld don in Taloja jail, Navi Mumbai so that he can write a book on the Salem-Monica Bedi affair.
 
 “I have come to know that my application has been dismissed... will discuss the matter with higher-ups once I get the denial letter and grounds,” Khan said.
 
 He is posted as additional district magistrate in Guna and has finalised the title for his book: ‘Love Demands Blood’.
 
 He had submitted his application to the general administration department (GAD), which was sent it to chief minister  .
 
 Among the things, Khan wanted to find out by spending time with Salem in prison was whether he felt true love for   and how much he misses her.
