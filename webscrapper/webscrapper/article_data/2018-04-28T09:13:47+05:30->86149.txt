MUMBAI: Known world over as ‘International Labour day,’ May 1 could also be a ‘judgement day’ for the current set of   office-bearers, who’re locked in a bitter battle with the Supreme Court-appointed   ( ).

 
 
 In its seventh status report in the SC, the two-member CoA comprising   and   has recommended elections for fresh set of office-bearers by removing acting president CK Khanna, acting secretary   and treasurer  , citing the end of their tenures as per the BCCI constitution. The SC has listed the matter for hearing on May 1. The CoA also asked for apex court’s direction on having an AGM without adoption of the new constitution as per Lodha reforms.
 
 The relations between office-bearers and CoA have hit an all-time low. While the SC-appointed committee has accused the office-bearers of delaying implementation of Lodha reforms. In its status report, the CoA cited Rule 15 (i) of existing BCCI constitution which states: “The election of Office Bearers and vice-presidents shall be held at the AGM of the Board every year. The office bearers and vice president so elected will hold office for three years.”
 
 The SC also needs to fill up two vacancies in CoA after   and   quit due to different reasons. It remains to be seen if the apex court relaxes a few of the Lodha reforms like one-state-one vote and the cooling off period after the BCCI members requested it to do so.
