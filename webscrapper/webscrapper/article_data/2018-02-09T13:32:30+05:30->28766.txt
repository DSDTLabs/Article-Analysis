MADURAI: The 48-hour mass casual leave by employees brought work to a standstill at the revenue department offices in Madurai on Thursday leaving them virtually deserted. Many people who came to the district collectorate and tahsildar offices in the morning expecting to get income certificates had to go back empty-handed.

 “I just hope that they give up the protest soon as I need the certificate soon. My family would get a vehicle of its own for the first time if I get selected,’’ said   of Vandiyur. State secretary of the   officials association, M P  , said that the distribution of about 8,000 certificates was affected due to the two-day strike by over 400 employees in the districts. The certificates were sought to prove community, birth and death, patta transfer as well as widowhood and income. 
 
 “We are demanding that the government fill up ten thousand vacancies in the revenue department, ranging from deputy collectors to village administrative officers. In the Group IV examinations held in the last three years, only revenue department vacancies had not been filled up. There were over 1,500 vacancies of typist and stenographer besides even 60 of deputy collector, RDO and personal assistants to collector,” he said. The protesting employees staged a demonstration at the collectorate building.
