JAIPUR: It seems age is no bar for the country’s obsession with the   Sixty years after   in Karauli district got married, the 83-year-old tied the   again, in the presence of his first wife, for want of a son.

 On Sunday, Sukhram rode on a horse, but without the friends who danced in his ‘baraat’ in 1958, and reached 30-year-old Rameshi Devi’s house to marry her.
 
 “My only son passed away almost 15 years ago when he was only 30. I had worked as a labourer and then as a contractor in Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan and have enough property. There is nobody to look after it. So, I was keen to get married again,” he told TOI.
 
 Residents of almost 12 adjoining villages were invited for the wedding and everyone who saw Sukhram’s grand wedding procession were in a state of disbelief. “It was the wish of the old man, what can we do?” said Ramji Lal Meena, a villager.
 
 Like any other young bridegroom, he performed every ritual at the wedding, including ‘haldi ki rasam, clad in a sherwani. “My first wife has no problem with this wedding. It is of course the wish of God. We only want to have a son,” he added.
 
 Many in the village were seen busy taking pictures of Sukhram and his wife Rameshi. “Rameshi was single and her family agreed for the marraige,” said a relative of the bride.
 
 Asked if the police had received any complaint relating to the issue, a senior officer of Supotara said, “We have not received any complaint on this matter.”
