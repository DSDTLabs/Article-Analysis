SEELERU ( ): CPI ( ) allegedly abducted five persons including four Odisha government officials from the cut-off area near Chitrakonda in Malkangiri district on Friday. 

 The neighbouring state is gearing up for their panchayat elections next month and the officials were at the local polling office discussing the same when the incident occurred. The naxals have not yet claimed responsibility of the kidnap.
 
 Sources said a group of Maoists abducted the five persons and produced them at a praja court at Similipodar village in the cut-off area. Security personnel have been pressed into action to save the abducted government officials, while family members of the abducted officials appealed to the naxals to release their kin. 
 
 The five persons have been identified as poll officials   and Purshottam Behra, junior engineers   and   as well as Jodamba village head Lakshaman Sisaâ€™s son, sources said. Another officer Lingaraj Majhi managed to escape. 
 
 Maoists had faced a major set back due to the Ramaguda encounter in the same cut-off area in October last year where 31 naxals and their sympathisers were killed, sources said, adding that they had put up posters in Gumma block asking the people to boycott the upcoming panchayat elections.
