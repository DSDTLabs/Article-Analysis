 Those chargesheeted are  , field supervisor at the Nand Nagri office of the corporation,  , an employee, Dinesh Gupta, dealing assistant, his nephew  , Jitender Sharma and Vinod Sharma, private individual who impersonated as Rishipal, a beneficiary of the funds.
 
 The loan was disbursed from the corporation and given Rishipal in 2003. The money was distributed equally among the accused.
 
 The fraud came to fore when the internal audit found the records been manipulated. A probe was initiated by the department after general manager of the corporation, Subhash Chander, lodged a complaint. Soon after, the accused returned the money to corporation’s account and tried to cover up the matter. However, the probe established the money trail and found that it was Birpal who had written and signed a false field verification report and Sushil Kumar had signed as Rishipal on most documents as beneficiary.
 
 The chargesheet stated that Vinod Sharma posed as an applicant of the loan and appeared as Rishipal wherever required.
 
 “Two savings accounts were opened in the name of non-existent people at Delhi cooperative bank, Khari Baoli branch and at GPO Kashmere Gate to deposit the money by Anil Gupta and Dinesh Gupta. The accused were arrested after the probe found them guilty and dismissed from service and Birpal retired,” said an officer.
