Not everything goes according to your plans. That’s something 'Ikyawann’s' lead actress   has just realised. The show, which did not garner the desired ratings, was moved from prime time slot to an evening slot recently.   says, “It’s sad, but the fact is that the show has not been able to deliver what was promised to viewers in the promos. It was a story about a tomboy who grows up to be a strong woman; instead the track deviated from the main story. What was conceptualised was way different from what is currently being portrayed. My co-actor Namish Taneja and I share a good chemistry but even that hasn’t help.”

 At the moment, Prachi isn’t seen much on the show and there is buzz that she may be opting out to pursue films down  . She has already bagged a role in a costume drama opposite   superstar Mammootty. Ask her about being paired opposite a much senior actor and she says, “If this can happen in Bollywood, then why not in the South? About television, no I’m not quitting my TV show. These are just rumours.”
 The actress, who is a netball player in real life, is 5 feet 11 inches tall. Has her big frame posed a problem in her career? “I have got work on the basis of my talent. Even on my previous show  , I was appreciated for my work. Being tall and well-built does not mean you can’t play lead roles,” 
 she signs off.
