BENGALURU: Councillors cutting across party lines on Monday demanded that funds allocated under the   welfare budget be utilized properly.

 Speaking at BBMP council meeting, Kadu Malleshwara corporator   said social welfare schemes had not been implemented almost a year after they were outlined in the budget. “Bommanahalli zone has ample funds for the disabled, but they are not being utilized,” said  , leader of the opposition.
 
 Corporators also said laptops — which were to be distributed among students — and things like sewing machines and cycles had still not reached beneficiaries. “I had called for a review meet four months ago with the officials concerned, asking them to speed up the process. However, they are yet to call for tenders” said MK Gunashekar, ex-chairperson, BBMP standing committee on taxation and finance.
 
 R Ramila, Kaveripura corporator, raised the issue of inadequate infrastructure at a BBMP hospital. “Kaveripura hospital was inaugurated two months ago, but it is yet to be staffed or get the necessary equipment. The building is still closed,” she rued. The health officer replied, saying the commissioner had directed them to recruit staff and float atender for the equipment, and it would be done in three weeks.
 
 Mayor   said pending bills related to welfare schemes should be cleared immediately, and the available funds distributed at the earliest.
 
 Referring to the recent fire at  , the mayor said: “It was only through media that BBMP officials found out about the incident. Even a Union minister visited the lake, but the AEE and JC were not present on the spot. If something like this happens again and officials don’t inform their superiors immediately, they will be suspended”.
