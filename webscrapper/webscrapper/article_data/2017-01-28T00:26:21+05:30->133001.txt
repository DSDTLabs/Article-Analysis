New Delhi: The BJP-led municipal corporations have “failed” Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Swachh Bharat Mission, said Yogendra Yadav-led  . Of the Rs 336 crore allocated to Delhi under the mission, just Rs 2.2 crore has been spent till January this year, it alleged.

 The party, which is planning to debut in electoral politics with the coming municipal polls, alleged that the north and east corporations have not spent a rupee out of the total allocation of Rs 88.2 (Rs 46.2 crore to north and Rs 41.9 crore to east) in 2015-16. The south corporation just spent Rs 1.8 crore out of Rs 66.4 crore allocated to it during the same period.
 
 “The corporations are responsible for the failure of PM’s flagship project. While they are citing shortage of funds for the sanitation mess in the city, they are unable to utilise the funds given to them by the Centre,” said Anupam, Swaraj India spokesperson.
 
 BJP-led corporations admit that they have not been able to utilise the funds. But they site technical issues. V P Pandey, leader of the house in north corporation, said the technical conditions put-up by the Centre on the expenditure of the fund is the main reason why the funds could not be utilised. “Even after a relaxation in the conditions, the local bodies are still supposed to borne 60% of the overall expenditure of projects conceived for utilising these funds and rest of the 40% is to be utilised from central funds,” he said
 
 The east corporation is, meanwhile, planning to return Rs 10 crore out of Rs 41 crore sanctioned to it.
