MUMBAI: The 12 civic officials who were served chargesheets in the   case have pleaded innocence, saying that they had initiated action against the two restobars where a fire erupted on December 29, 2017, and killed 14 people.

 The officials, including assistant municipal commissioners   and  , have stated this in their replies that they have submitted to the inquiry committee.

Meanwhile, a subcommittee has also been formed, which is investigating whether the IT policy had been misused.
 
 “We have received almost all the replies and hearings will be conducted soon. We have three months to complete the inquiry,” said Singhal.
 
 According to a civic source, all officials have said they had issued notices to the two eateries and initiated demolitions. They have said that despite all the action taken, the restobars—1Above and Mojo’s Bistro—resumed operations in no time. “But these officials are expected to keep an eye on irregularities, which was not done. We have recorded statements of the heads of the various departments as well. So we know what exactly was whose responsibility,” said an official.
