GURUGRAM: A group of 40 parents protested against   15 on Monday, alleging an exorbitant fee hike by the school authorities. Parents, who didn’t want to reveal their names, told TOI that the school management had notified them about a fee hike of Rs 6,700 during a meeting held in December 17, 2016. 

 The school, parents alleged, justified the hike, citing the   government’s directive to implement the  . “We asked them to furnish the Form VI, which they are supposed to file with the Haryana education department on December 31 every year,” a parent said. “The form contains the details about the fees they collect from the students and the expenditure they are could be making during the next one year. It would have cleared all doubts. CBSE guidelines say the schools run by Trusts cannot demand more money until all funds were exhausted. The Form IV would have revealed the amount of money they still had.”
 
 On January 21, aggrieved parents’ groups had convened a meeting and decided to visit the school. “The school authorities didn’t let us in. Instead they called police to whisk us out,” another parent said.
 
 Parents said two years ago, the school had funds to the tune of Rs 6 crore. “The school even had uploaded this figure on its website,” a parent said. According to parents, the school reportedly conveyed to them that their funds had dried up. “We doubt that they put all the money in the  , which is against the CBSE norms. They cannot consecrate this money for any other purposes other than spending for the children. We wrote to the school on this, but the authorities didn’t respond. Then we went to the district education officer, and registered out grievance in the CM window.”
 
 Sources told TOI that the protests prompted   to visit the school today. “During the meeting, the school has decided to waive off a substantial amount from the fee hiked as part of arrears to be paid to teachers after implementing the 7th pay commission,” they said.
