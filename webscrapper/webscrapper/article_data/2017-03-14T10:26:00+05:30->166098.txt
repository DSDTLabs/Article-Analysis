HYDERABAD: The   has decided not to revise the existing market values of the land across the state for this year. The state's Advocate General K Ramakrishna Reddy conveyed this to   on Monday. The bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Shameem Akther recorded the statement of the state counsel and told the petitioner M Kodanda Reddy who is challenging the inaction of the authorities in effecting an upward revision of market value before each land acquisition made by the state to respond to this decision of the state.

 Earlier your grievance was that there was no decision by the state, now there is a clear decision. if you are still aggrieved, you can challenge the new decision, the bench said conveying its intent to close the matter. A revision means it need not always be an upward revision, it could be downward as well, the bench said in one of the earlier hearings. 
 
 The petitioner's counsel however sought time to respond to the state's latest decision and sought the matter to be postponed by a few days.
 
 The AG furnished to the court the policy decision taken by the state in this regard and conveyed to the state registration wing's commissioner and IG in the form of a government memo. The official communication says that   has resulted in a fall in revenues through land registrations.
 
 As of now, the state counsel said they will not enhance the market values of the land to allow the real estate market to rationalise on its own. We have not revised it in 2014 and 2015 and we have decided not to revise it now also, the state memo says.
