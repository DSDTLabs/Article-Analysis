TRICHY: The BJP-led government was trying to bring in a presidential system by wielding control over state governments, alleged newly-elected   MLA TTV Dhinakaran at Kumbakonam on Tuesday. 

 “The Centre is infringing on the rights of the state governments. Dissent against the government is muffled using raids by   and IT. But, such blatant misuse of power will only be a setback for them as shown by the votes they ( ) garnered in RK Nagar election, which were less than  ,” Dhinakaran told reporters.
 
 Terming the ‘inspections’ and meetings with officials being carried out by governor Banwarilal Purohit as unprecedented, Dhinakaran said that such autonomous tracking of the government was happening for the first time since independence. “It will set a wrong precedent. The ministers and MLAs remain mute spectators to it only to protect their skin,” said Dhinakaran.
 
 On the acquittals in the 2G spectrum allocation case, Dhinakaran blamed the state and centre for failing to carrying out the trial effectively. He also said that AIADMK would have come a cropper had DMK done its best in the by-polls. “The ruling party had been winning in RK Nagar for the past two decades. If DMK had worked well in RK Nagar, AIADMK would have forfeited its deposit,” he added.
