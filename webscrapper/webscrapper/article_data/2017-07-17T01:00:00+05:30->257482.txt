Actor   returned to TV after a break of five years with a heavy-bearded look for season three of ' '. However, barely two weeks since the launch, the makers have decided to change his look to a clean-shaven one, which is similar to his appearance in the first season of the show. Apparently, the popularity of Barun’s character Arnav Singh Raizada in the first season has prompted makers to get him to don the original look.

 Says producer  , “Everything on the show is always done to connect better with the audience. Barun’s haircut was due to the changing graph of the show, which went from intense to fun. We will be returning to the beard look after a few weeks.”
 
 Barun adds, “I wouldn’t know if the look has been changed for better connect with viewers. That’s entirely the maker’s decision and it’s not my place to ask them the reason; I just follow the instructions. I got rid of my beard as they wanted to show more of my face on the show.”
