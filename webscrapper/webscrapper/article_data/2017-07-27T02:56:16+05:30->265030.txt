NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that corruption in Delhi government departments had reduced by around 70% after the   ( ) came to power in February 2015.

 Speaking at an event organised by the Delhi Vidyut Board Pensioners Association, Kejriwal claimed that despite “hurdles being created for the AAP government and efforts made to derail its work”, the government had managed to achieve a lot for the people of Delhi. “We have introduced several public welfare schemes, including free surgery at private hospitals. We will neither indulge in corrupt practices nor will we allow officers to do so. I am not saying that corruption has reduced by 100% in the government but it has come down by about 60% to 70%,” he said.
 
 The CM said that the government had been saving money through different projects and investing it in welfare schemes. “Power distribution companies do not deposit money in the pension fund on time due to which there is a delay in disbursing pensions. Henceforth, this fund will be deposited through the   in the pension trust,” he added.
