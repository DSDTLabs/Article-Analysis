RAIPUR: A tusker was found dead in a paddy field at a village in   district on Wednesday. The district has recorded third death of an elephant in past six months. However, the reason of death is yet to be ascertained. 

 The elephant was found dead in the field of a farmer at   village. After forest officials were informed, a team was then sent to the spot and body was sent for post-mortem examination.
 
 Though there was no injury mark on the body of the tusker, officials fear involvement of locals as the region is known for human-animal conflict that often is the reason behind death of one of them. Often, it has been found that farmers barricade fields with electric wire to keep elephants at bay. But, many elephants have been killed after coming in contact with the wires in the past.
 
 During investigation in the latest case, forest officers said that no such wiring was found from the spot and the reason of death would be known only from the autopsy report. 
 
 Raigarh and its neighbouring regions, including Dharamjaigarh, Surguja, Jashpur, Koriya, Ambikapur and   have been recording elephant attacks for past 8-10 years with loss of lives of both humans and animals while destruction of crops and houses pinch the government as it has to give compensation to the victims.
