Trichy: Among the three entrances to the Sri Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam, Ranga Ranga Gopuram is the most preferred by pilgrims arriving on foot who make up almost 70-75 per cent of devotees visiting the shrine. However, this entrance is mostly obstructed by street vendors and encroachments of shops which occupy a portion of the road as well as pedestrian pathway. Perhaps the encroachments are not a grave threat to the pilgrims, but the presence of traders on the roads is. They put incoming pilgrims at risk as two-wheelers and four-wheelers criss cross the way hampering their smooth movement.

 “The roads within Rajagopuram virtually serve as a display platform for vendors to attract the pilgrims whereas the real shops serve as store rooms. Though the condition here is not as risky as Madurai Meenakshi Amman temple, it is better to prevent than seek cure later,” D Santhanakrishnan, a resident of Thiruvalluvar street, said. Apart from the encroachments, vehicles accessing the stretch add to the congestion. The 350-metre-long stretch between Rajagopuram and Ranga Ranga Gopuram is difficult to tread even on two-wheeler. However, often cars and jeeps stray into the area stalling the movement of devotees. 
 
 Trichy Corporation sources said that encroachments by hawkers recurred on the stretch despite their frequent eviction drives. Meanwhile, labour organisation asserted that the scenario would change only if the vending committee, a body to regulate street vendors, was constituted by the civic body. The committee could earmark appropriate places to do business without affecting the vehicular movement.
