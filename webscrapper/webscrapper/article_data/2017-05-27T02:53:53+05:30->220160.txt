NEW DELHI: Chief minister   has asked top health officials to hold regular inspections at hospitals to check the availability of medicines and consumables. 

 The direction, sources said, was issued after the CM found several deficiencies in drug supply and functioning of equipment at   in north Delhi’s Mangolopuri.
 
 “Kejriwal had asked the hospital to submit an action taken report on the deficiencies which was submitted on Friday. But the CM found it to be an eyewash and asked top officials to personally visit and find out the exact status,” a source said, adding that the CM may himself conduct more surprise inspections in coming days.
