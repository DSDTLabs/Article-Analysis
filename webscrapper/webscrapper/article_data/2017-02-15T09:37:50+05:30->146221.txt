MUMBAI: While hundreds packed the road at Kannamwar Nagar, Vikhroli, eager to hear their leader after a long time, MNS chief Raj Thackeray began his first poll speech in a mellowed voice, speaking about the problems back home.

 “My son (Amit Thackeray) is in hospital, which is why it took me some time to reach this venue. I am shuttling between hospital and home for the last seven to eight days and therefore was not able to pay full attention to poll campaigns last week,” he said. 
 
 He said that such news cannot be “kept under wraps”, without making any mention of what had happened to his son. 
 
 “Some people know about it. But the best part is the support I got from my party workers and senior functionaries.

I am grateful to them,” he said, while not speaking much about what was ailing his son.
 
 Raj had offered to form an alliance with the  , with the objective to keep the   away from power. But this did not materialize.
