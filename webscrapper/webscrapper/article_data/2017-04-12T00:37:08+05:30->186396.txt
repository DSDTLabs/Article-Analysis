Mumbai: The public works department ( ) has appointed an expert committee to determine the cause of the damage to the   at the   on the Eastern Express Highway. It shall also suggest short- and long-term measures to rectify the situation.

 The Thane-bound arm of the Amar Mahal flyover, constructed in 1995, has been closed for vehicular   since April 8, after the first damage was noticed.
 
 Senior officials from the PWD, including principal secretary Ashish Kumar Singh, inspected the site on Tuesday morning to assess the damage and its impact on traffic. Later in the day, PWD officials held meetings with experts from   and IIT-Bombay.
 
 The state government has roped in Professor Ravi Sinha from the   and is expecting a solution in a couple of days, though it will take a few more days than that to make the flyover motorable again. “This, however, is a short-term solution. We are also looking at what can be done in the long term to strengthen the bridge,” a senior official from the PWD said.
 
 Another official said the bridge was constructed with the unique Quadriccon design, for which the requisite expertise was not easily available. The Thane-bound carriageway of the flyover, which is a concrete bridge mounted on a steel structure, began sagging when some joints at the centre slipped. 
 
 “Even the damage that has been caused is unusual. Hence, it is taking us a while to figure out a solution,” the official said.
 
 The official said that for a long-term solution, they would take as much time as required to fix the damage properly so as not to compromise the safety of motorists.
 
 Traffic continued to crawl on the Eastern Express Highway on the Thane-bound carraigeway, with vehicles lining up till Kurla in the south.
 
 The traffic police were present in large numbers to ensure discipline at the junction as some portion below the affected flyover was also blocked for vehicular movement.
