Tuticorin: Tense moments prevailed at the office of the Revenue Division Officer (RDO) at Kovilpatti on Monday as people from   community condemned the RDO for allegedly using her mobile phone and not listening to their grievances. Members of the community and   representatives, who accompanied them, said that the RDO was using WhatsApp without paying attention to them.

 Around 50 persons from the Kattunayakan community went to the RDO’s office seeking community certificates for their children. They claimed that despite parents possessing community certificate, it was not issued for the children. They claimed that many children from that community residing in Ward No 29 of Kovilpatti were affected as community certificate was not issued for one-and-a-half-years.
 
 On Monday, the petitioners were allowed to meet RDO Anitha only after a protest. “But she was glued to her mobile phone for a long time without listening to us,”   town secretary   told TOI.
 
 A video recording also shows the officer checking WhatsApp status and scrolling up and down her WhatsApp without checking any messages. Petitioners said they are disappointed and threatened to stage protests at the RDO’s office from January 18 if community certificates were not issued to them.
 
 District collector   said that the issue pertaining to the delay in issuance of the community certificate was looked into. On the allegation pertaining to the RDO using mobile phone, the collector said that he would inquire with the officer concerned (RDO) about it.
