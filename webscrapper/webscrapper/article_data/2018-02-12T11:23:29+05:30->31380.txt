HYDERABAD: The   dismissed claims by   that the Hanbli School of jurisprudence allows shifting of mosques. Replying to a query from a Board member during the meeting and later from a reporter at the press conference, Board secretary Maualna Khalid Saifullah Rahmani said once a mosque, always a mosque.

 “Maulana   is erroneously referring to the Hanbli School to justify his un-Islamic suggestion. Even the Hanbli School which allows shifting of sites of mosques does it for mosques which are abandoned or away from Muslim population. “There are around 5,000 Muslims in   city and Muslims never abandoned their mosque in Ayodhya on their own. They were stopped from praying there,” said Board secretary  .
 
 The Board categorically denied it has authorized any member to have dialogue with anyone, including Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, for an outof-court settlement to the Babri Mosque-Ramajanambhoomi dispute. “Since 1991-92, the Board has maintained that the court is the only recourse we can take to settle the issue. Individually, members can meet anyone, but the Board unanimously decided we will abide by court’s verdict,” said Board secretary Kamal Farooqui.
  
  
 
 Hyderabad MP and chairperson of Hyderabad plenary’s reception committee   had told TOI on Saturday that citing   where mosques have been shifted to make roads and flyovers is wrong because in the case of Babri mosque it concerns a historic structure. “Who will guarantee that after building a temple on the mosque site in Ayodhya, Hindu organizations will shelve their list of other mosques which they want to be replacewithtemples? Muslims will not accept shifting of mosque plan,” Owaisi said.
