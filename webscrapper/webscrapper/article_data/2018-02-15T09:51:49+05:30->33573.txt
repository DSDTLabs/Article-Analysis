AURANGABAD: A section of students from   (ITI) on Wednesday held a protest demonstration against the move of authorities to hold their examinations online.

 First semester examinations for 22 courses taught at the ITI will be held online from February 17. The reform is taking place in view of the directives issued by the state government. 
 
 A group of students, especially those from rural areas, has expressed apprehensions about the online exams and demanded continuation of the old pattern. Top authorities, however, have dispelled fears.
 
 A student from rural area said, “Many students like me do not have adequate exposure to computer operations. We are worried that whether any inadvertent error on our part would cost us heavily during examination. Many students from rural areas have phobia about using computers and the same could affect their performance during the examinations. Therefore, examinations must be conducted in offline manner,” he said. 
 
 Student activist   said that holding online exams should be made optional. “It is unjust on the part of authorities to make online exams compulsory for ITI students. It can take toll on   who are not familiar with basics of information technology,” he said. 
 
 The protesting students claimed that the evaluation pattern could spell a doom for a section of rural students. 
 
 A total of 831 students would appear for Paper I during online examination and 715 for Paper II at government ITI. The examination is scheduled to take place between February 17 and February 21. 
 
 Government ITI principal M S  , said, “Online examination was policy decision taken by the state government. The online examinations for ITI would be conducted across the state. We have been holding mock-tests to help students overcome the phobia associated with the examination.”
