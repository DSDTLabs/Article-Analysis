KOLKATA: If it’s the  , expect the unexpected.

 
 Vilified for lack of form and jeered for missing goals even during practice sessions,   chose the biggest stage to show critics it wasn’t by fluke that he had topped the I-League scoring charts last season. A magical brace from the Cameroonian powered underdogs Mohun Bagan to a comprehensive 2-0 win in the I-League’s return-leg clash against   at   on Sunday afternoon.
 
 The game was just 55 seconds old when Dicka ruffled the netting with his first touch, evoking memories of Mohammad Akbar’s 17th-second strike for Bagan in the CFL derby four decades ago. Dicka’s second goal was even better as he scored with a sumptuous left-footed volley midway through the first session to help Bagan do the double on their arch-rivals in the I-League this season.
 
 It would have been 3-0 had Nikhil Kadam’s shot not hit the post in the dying moments. In fact, the margin could have been five or more had Kadam not spurned a golden opportunity late in the first session or if Sheikh Faiaz and Akram Moghrabi made use of absolute sitters.
 
 It’s true that East Bengal suffered a massive blow as Mahmoud Al Amna had to leave the pitch in the fourth minute following a challenge by Raynier Fernandes, but every member of Shankarlal Chakraborty’s team deserves credit for the way they applied themselves and went about their job. They thoroughly outplayed East Bengal, even toying with their opponents at times. So complete was the green and maroons’ domination that they didn’t feel Sony Norde’s absence at all.
 
 
 
 KOLKATA: East Bengal’s hopes for a maiden I-League title suffered a big blow as coach Khalid Jamil accepted full responsibility of the debacle.
 
 “I admit that it was 100 per cent my mistake. Our preparation was not ideal. We should have been more defensive. But I am not a coward... I am not stepping down. I accept full responsibility and we will fight back.”
