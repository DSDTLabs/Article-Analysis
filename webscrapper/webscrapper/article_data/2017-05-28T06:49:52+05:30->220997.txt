THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: While the decision to   is a welcome move, experts believe that the   will have to turn to technology if they intend to  .

 Sony Thomas, road safety and communication consultant under the World Bank, said that the department was badly in need of a system to keep track of the repeat offenders among drivers. “In fact, the   representatives had met the department authorities some time ago to discuss the possibilities of developing a smartphone app, which the law enforcers in the department can use to check the track record of a driver just by keying in the licence number,“ Thomas said. However, the department authorities are yet to take a decision on this matter.
 
 He said that at present, the department does not have any proper system to track a driver.With the present systems comprising speed detecting cameras, they can only detect vehicles that are repeatedly involved in violations. “There are possibilities that a vehicle is driven by different drivers. So there needs to be a system in place to track the drivers. And, to do this effectively, all information pertaining to all the licence holders in the state must be made available in digital format so that law enforcers can retrieve them and verify any time using a smart device,“ Thomas added.
 
 The latest move by motor vehicles department is similar to the practice followed by majority of developed nations, where a driver is given demerit points each time he or she is caught violating traffic rules. When caught for a fifth time, licence of the driver is suspended.
