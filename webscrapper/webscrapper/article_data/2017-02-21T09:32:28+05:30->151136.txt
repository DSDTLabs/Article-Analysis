MIDNAPORE: The   police on Monday moved a plea for an arrest warrant against   and his associate Kashi Rao in the murder of their rival underworld figure Srinu Naidu.
The plea -moved in the court of Midnapore chief judicial magistrate (CJM) -was inconclusive and will continue on Tuesday. Rambabu, who was arrested in 2016 for his alleged involvement in rioting at Kharagpur, had secured bail just a fortnight before Srinu's murder. Rambabu, who once reigned the Kharagpur underworld in the 90s, was arrested in 2001for the murder of Trinamool leader   and his brother Manas Choubey. He was convicted for the Choubey killings. Later, after nine years he was granted bail by the   in 2010 Pleading for warrant, special additional public prosecutor (APP)   said the probe is difficult unless Rambabu was taken into custody .“He is currently outside the state and the warrant is necessary to bring him back,“ Naik argued.
