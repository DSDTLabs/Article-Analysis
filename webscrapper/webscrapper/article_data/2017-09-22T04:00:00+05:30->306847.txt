Surat:   

 Surat Airport Action Committee (SAAC) has threatened to launch an indefinite hunger strike at the airport demanding international airport from October 1. Earlier, in February-2017, the SAAC office-bearers had announced their plan to launch an indefinite hunger strike by giving an ultimatum to the central government. 
 
 Letters sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union civil aviation minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju by SAAC sought starting of international operations from Surat airport before Gujarat assembly elections or else people will be forced to begin an indefinite hunger strike from October 1. 
 
 SAAC president Sanjay Ezhawa shared the official documents gathered from central and state governments regarding development works carried out at Surat airport. 
 
 Ezhawa stated the PMO office accepted that Gujarat government had proposed development of Surat and Vadodara airports. However, there was no mention in the documents gathered from the meeting held at Gandhinagar regarding Gujarat’s civil aviation sector development in January 2015.
 
 Sources said Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) is yet to approve the customs notified status for Surat airport. Airports Authority of India (AAI) had sent the customs airport proposal to CBEC seven months ago. 
 
 “The work for the runway extension is going on at a slow pace. The recarpeting of 185 metre runway is yet to be completed. On the other hand, the customs notified status for airport is yet to be approved. In such circumstances, Surat is continuously being deprived of its right to fly. The government has a soft corner towards developing international airport at Rajkot’s Hirasar,” Ezhawa said.
