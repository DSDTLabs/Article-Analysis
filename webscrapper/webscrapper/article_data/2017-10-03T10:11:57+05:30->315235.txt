HYDERABAD: The   has acquitted four life convicts in a double murder case that took place in Kalluru police station limits of   district in February 2007. The bench suspected manipulation by the police on the behest of politicians to fix the accused. It directed the authorities to set the accused free on completion of official formalities.

 The bench was allowing an appeal by Konakala Jamalaiah, his wife,  , and sons, Koteswar Rao and Ramakrishna, challenging the sentence awarded by family judge-cum-additional sessions judge at Khammam, charging them with murdering M   and his son Venkata Satyanarayana.
 
 Kalluru police charged Jamalaiah and his family with the killing of Seshulu and his son on February 28, 2007, by attacking them with knives and a crowbar after sprinkling chilly powder on them. The lower court sentenced the four accused to life imprisonment in 2011.
 
 The bench noted that the accused, too, were injured but the police didn't cite any reasons on how they were injured. The bench also noted that the doctor who conducted the post-mortem stated that he did not notice any chilly powder on the bodies of the deceased. The bench also found that there was political rivalry between the families of the accused and deceased.
 
 Referring to lapses in the probe, the bench observed that “given the strong possibility of political intervention and the glaring inconsistencies in the prosecution's case, including registration and dispatch of the two FIRs, giving rise to a strong likelihood of manipulation of the case by the police, the version of the prosecution as put forth opens the door to doubt and suspicion.“
 
 The bench also said “the very foundation of the prosecution's case is therefore rendered shaky and wholly unworthy of acceptance. This Court finds that the prosecution's case was fraught with inconsistencies and weaknesses, the fundamental defect being its failure to present the origin and genesis of the occurrence in its full and true form.“
