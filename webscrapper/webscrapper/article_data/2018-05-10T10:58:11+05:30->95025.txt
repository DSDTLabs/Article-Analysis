Eager students posed various queries related to multitude issues ranging from basic differences between NCC, NSS and other such organisations to the other perks of NCC that can help them while joining the Indian Army. Girl students were curious as to what NCC has to offer for the female cadets to which   proudly responded with images of country’s first three women fighters. 
 
 The session started at 10 am and was followed by an hour-long   show within the school premise, which the students enjoyed thoroughly. The show included scale models of fighters and transport planes presently held by the   and flying display of remote-controlled aero models. This was an example of one of the perks offered to NCC cadets. The entire session was also attended by principal Dr Vibha Ray, who was instrumental in the organisation of this session.
 
 “The students responded enthusiastically, much to my surprise. Some of them were not even aware of NCC due to lack of exposure in the area. However, as the session proceeded, highlighting the advantages of NCC like personality development, shooting, and flying, more and more students listened on attentively, thrilled with the plethora of opportunities.” the Wing Commander said.
 
 The session concluded with all students eagerly anticipating the opportunity to be a part of NCC lifestyle.
