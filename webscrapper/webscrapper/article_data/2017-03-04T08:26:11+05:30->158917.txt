VISAKHAPATNAM: To wean tribal youth away from Maoists influence, the   (CRPF) and Nehru   of ministry of sports and youth services are jointly organising a tribal youth exchange programme which includes a trip to Simla in Himachal Pradesh from March 6 to 12. Around 30 students, including girls from Maoists-infested areas in Visakha agency, have been selected for the tour.

 CRPF 198 battalion Commandant Kulveer Singh Deshwal said the aim of the tour is to familiarise the youth with different cultures of the country. “Most of the tribal youth in the Visakha agency have never even visited Vizag city. If they could visit the urbanised areas and learn of various cultures, then they will get ideas to improve their career and future,” the commandant said. He said identifying the youth for the trip had started in December and the CRPF staff would also accompany the students. 
 
 Nehru Yuva Kendra coordinator Venkata Ramana said this is the third such cultural exchange programme organised by the central government to the district. Earlier, batches of 30 tribal youth each were sent to Chennai and Lucknow. The tribal youth from Maoists-infested areas like Rudakota, Pedabayalu and other parts of the agency were selected for the programme. During the tour, they would interact with people at Simla and learn about the culture of the state and the particular area. 
 
 Before leaving the port city on Friday, the youth were congratulated by the CRPF officials A Sarang and NK Yadav and others. CRPF staff including the commandant joined them for the tribal dance of Dhimsa.
