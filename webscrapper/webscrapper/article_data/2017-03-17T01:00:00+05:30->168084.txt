Today is a big day for filmmaker duo  , known for their thrillers, loaded with twists and turns. Abbas’ son Mustafa’s debut film, ' ' opens in cinemas and the Burmallas can barely wait to find out what the audience verdict is. The film has garnered positive response, right from the day the first trailer was released.

 Mustafa’s screen presence was instantly acknowledged. His effortless dance moves, evident in the songs, have been appreciated. Ditto his chemistry with leading lady  , who has been impressive right from her first film 'Fugly' to her last release, 'M S Dhoni: The Untold Story'.
 
 'Machine', presented by Jayantilal Gada (PEN) revolves around racing enthusiasts Sarah (Kiara Advani) and Ransh ( ) who meet each other in mysterious circumstances. Over a period of time, they grow fond of each other and eventually fall in love. But a few twists in the story change the course of their lives.
 
 While shooting, Kiara decided to use some of her belongings, including a scarf, to make her character look relatable. On the other hand, the film’s crew worked doubly hard to ensure its car races add the right amount of thrill to the narrative. This edgy entertainer, like the filmmakers’ other projects, is laced with catchy songs that suit every mood. There’s a beach number, a club anthem, romantic songs and a Sufi number too. 'Tera Junoon' is Mustafa’s favourite while Kiara loves '  Toh Mera'. For Abbas-Mustan, Machine is special for a reason. “It’s the launch of our son. 'Machine' has reinvented us as directors. The script had everything we look for. It also had a beautiful message that the audience will take home with them. Thrillers play with the mind of the audience. But this time, there’s a twist there too.”
 
 'Machine', produced by Haresh Patel, Pranay Chokshi, Dhaval Jayantilal Gada and Abbas-Mustan, releases on March 17.
