CHANDIGARH: As part of the ongoing campaign, Chandigarh traffic police has been telling shopkeepers, who sell vehicle spare parts, and motor mechanics not to modify bikes for producing thumping sound while driving.

 The police department has also written to the SSPs of the neighbouring cities Mohali and Ropar to keep a check on the mechanics there as in most cases of bikes challaned in Chandigarh for sound pollution were found to have been modified in these two towns.
 While talking to TOI, Chandigarh traffic police SSP   said the mechanics are being told not to modify bikes. “We have deputed DSPs and inspectors to tell mechanics and sensitise them about modification of bikes and its consequences. If mechanics still modify bikes, stern action will be taken against them too,” said Anand.
 
 “For such cases, there is a provision of penalty of Rs 5,000 and imprisonment up to six years in the   rules,” he added.
 
 A number of bikes, especially,   are modified to generate ‘pataka’ sound. City residents have been complaining to police against the ‘nuisance’ created by such bikers and have been asking for action.
 
 The police have in turn launched special drives against such noise-emanating bikes. From January till now, traffic police have also challaned around 690 bikers for noise pollution.
 
 Besides challaning, traffic police have impounded 71 bikes for noise pollution, out of which 34 were bullet motorcycles with modified cylinders. Traffic police released the impounded bikes only after removing the modified cylinder from a bike.
 
 UT traffic police have also recommended to triple the fee of challans for noise pollution. Police have recommended to increase the amount for first challan from Rs1,000 to Rs 3,000 and Rs 5,000 from Rs 2,000 for subsequent offences. Police also requested the resident to share information or video of such violators on the facebook page and WhatsApp number of traffic police.
