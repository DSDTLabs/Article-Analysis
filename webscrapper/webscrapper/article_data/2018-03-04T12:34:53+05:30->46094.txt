In  , friendships are meant to be broken. The latest to bite the dust is the actor-director jodi of   and   Sengupta. The duo shared an envious bond when they did films like   2011,  , Mrs Sen, A Political Murder and meant more to each other than just colleagues. But things took a turn after they did the Hindi movie, Tere Aane Se, together. I hear it has nothing to do with the usual tale of financers running away, which could be the obvious reason since the film is taking rather long to complete, but their own inability to adjust as producer (Rituparna) and director. Every time Agnidev would travel to Mumbai, he would put up at her flat, but now he looks for separate accommodation there. They have hardly spoken since the shoot, but then, all it takes to bridge the gap is a phone call.
