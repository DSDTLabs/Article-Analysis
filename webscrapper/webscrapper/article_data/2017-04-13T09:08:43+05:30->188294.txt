MUMBAI: Private and deemed medical institutes in the state plan to move Bombay high court again, seeking protection of their rights to run the institute. 

 After Medical Council of India (MCI) directed all states to hold centralized admissions for 100% seats in deemed and private institutes, the state government filed an affidavit on Wednesday, stating that the petition filed by the institutes stands null and void.
 
 Adjourned to next Tuesday, the government said the petition has become infructuous, because pending petition the MCI has come out with a proposal regarding common entrance test.
 
 Senior counsel Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, appearing for a Trust created by parents, as an intevener, said that in view of a   judgment, the petition "may not have become infructuous".  , appearing for petitioners, said interim admissions granted need to be confirmed. The court has called on all parties to arrive at a common consensus if possible.
 
 Deemed institutes had moved court against the state government last year when it had decided on centralized admissions.
