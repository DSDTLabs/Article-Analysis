HYDERABAD: The city's tech power may have helped it set a breakneck speed on the information superhighway but its lagging streets behind when it comes to ensuring smooth flow of traffic, especially in the IT corridor. 

 Parking, in particular, has become a major pain for techies who are forced to park their vehicles by the roadside. With T-Hub Phase 2, the IKEA store,   and My Home Puja coming up at the  , things are only set to worsen, points out   ( ) Barani Kumar Aroll.
 
 "Parking is becoming a major nightmare for techies. Though cops are issuing e challans, they are forced to park by the side of the road due to non-availability of parking space in offices of several IT companies. Roadside parking is leading to blockage of the carriageway and slow movement of traffic at certain places," Aroll told TOI.
 
 However, Cyberabad Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) A R   blamed IT companies for the IT corridor's parking woes. He said cops are not issuing challans to vehicles parked on the pavements near offices of IT companies and are only taking action against those parked by the roadside near busy traffic areas. "Many IT companies have inadequate parking space. In fact, some have a higher number of employees as compared to the total built-up area, due to which 40-50% of cars are parked outside. Companies have to take care of the issue and can't expect the government to do it," DCP Srinivas said, urging techies to use public transport and adopt carpooling and advised companies to beef up their inhouse transport facilities.
 
 SCSC is now trying to identify parking space in nearby localities from where employees can be taken in shuttle buses to their offices. TSIIC is trying to buy more shuttle buses and hand them over to the SCSC for operation, Aroll said.
