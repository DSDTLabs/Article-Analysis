CHENNAI: There were translation errors in 49 out of the 180 questions in NEET   paper, said  , a Chennai-based   which conducted special training classes for below poverty line students in  .

 At a press meeting here on Wednesday, the NGO representatives pointed out the translation errors in the Tamil   question paper. The exam was held on May 6.
 
 They said Tamil translation of the word 'cheetah' should be 'siruthai.' But it appeared it appeared 'seetha' in the question paper (question number 75), they said.
 
 Another error is that for the word 'multiple allele'(a technical word in biology) in question number 77, it was printed as 'pala kutu allelgal'. It should have been 'pal kootu,' they said.
 
 Similar errors had occurred in 47 other questions and the CBSE should provide grace marks for all these questions, said Tech For All founder G B Ram Prakash. “This means, every candidate who took up the test in Tamil should get 196 marks as grace marks,” he said.
 
  
  
 
 
 According to him, the reason for the confusion is that there are no NCERT books available in Tamil and the CBSE failed to standardise technical words in Tamil.
 
 Last year, different question papers were given to English and Tamil candidates and the CBSE had assured the Supreme Court that the errors would not be repeated this year, he said.
 
 In case of ambiguity in translation of any question, English version shall be treated as final, says a disclaimer printed on page one of the question paper in Tamil. “It’s okay to ask the students to refer to the English version in case of one or two errors. Students will not be able to find enough time to go through both the versions for 49 questions,” he added.
 
 Around 24,000 students took NEET UG in Tamil this year.
