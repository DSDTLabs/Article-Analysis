Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has directed a five-member committee, including the chief engineer of water resources department (WRD), to visit a disputed property at St Cruz and ascertain whether it forms part of a local water body. The division bench comprising Justice F M Reis and Justice Nutan D Sardessai issued the order in view of rival contentions about the existence (or otherwise) of a water body (Bondvoll lake) in the disputed property in St Cruz-Bambolim. St Cruz resident Arturo D’Souza had filed a public interest litigation alleging that the disputed property is part of the Bondvoll lake. The committee will comprise WRD chief engineer Sandeep Nadkarni, executive engineer D Y Salelkar (WD-I), Goa University hydrogeologist Adiveppa Chachadi, WRD assistant hydrogeologist Anil Phatarpekar and Tiswadi deputy collector Pundalik Khorjuvekar. The tenant of this property is opposing the petition. After due notice to the respondents, including the tenant as intervenor, the inspection shall be carried out and if the committee confirms that a water body exists, then it will have to suggest measures to protect it, the judges stated. The committee has been given eight weeks from the date of the order to submit a report of inspection. Nigel Da Costa Frias, appearing on behalf of the petitioner, specified the survey numbers which form part of the area of the lake, but the advocate general informed the court that the water body extends to other survey numbers as well.  “The extent of the subject water body can also be a matter to be considered by the committee we propose to appoint with that regard,” the judges held.  Asha Desai, appearing on behalf of the intervenor, pointed out that her client is a tenant in the disputed property which is agricultural land. This was disputed by Calapor comunidade, respondent No. 8, the original property owner. The matter will be heard October 9.
