IMPHAL: Education minister   has called upon different sections of society to make education a disturbance-free domain to ensure that students can complete their academic calendars without any hindrance. 

 A couple of days ago, rebel group   (MC-Progressive), warned to shut down all catholic schools alleging that they admit new students on the basis of lottery. Schools have remained closed since Monday. Radheshyam has instructed all private schools and colleges of the state to be fair during the admission process and follow rules and guidelines laid down by the education department. 
 
 Meanwhile, condemning the twin grenade blasts at   polo ground on Monday, CM N   said during the ongoing budget session that his government will soon set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe into it.
