KOLKATA/MIDNAPORE/BORJORA: Bengal’s flood toll climbed to 31 on Saturday as water levels barely receded across marooned villages and   joined the rescue operations to evacuate more and more people. 

 In West Midnapore’s Ghatal, 30 men, women and children were airlifted to safety by an IAF Mi-17 V5 helicopter. The 30 were picked up from the terrace of a two-storeyed house that had been cut off in inundated   village of Ghatal’s Manoharpur-I gram panchayat. 
 
 Officials at Nabanna said there are plans to widen the aerial rescue operations to evacuate more people marooned in floods. The death toll in floods meanwhile, rose to 31 on Saturday with three more deaths, including two in Bankura’s Borjora.
 
 After Friday’s aborted rescue bid, the IAF chopper returned to Pratappur a little after noon on Saturday and carried out repeated sorties around the house belonging to Panja brothers — Amar and Hareram. With flood waters rising up to the first floor, Amar, Hareram, their wives, kids and neighbours and other families remained hauled up atop the terrace of the Panjas’ home. Barring the Panjas, homes of all the others had been completely submerged or destroyed. 
 
 The family members had refused to board the helicopter on Friday after the Air Force men lowered the chopper’s ladder for them. They had reportedly expressed fear about their ability to climb up, saying it was something they had never done. On Saturday, though, Air Force men helped them overcome those fears by helping each man, woman and child climb the ladder one at a time after tying a belt around their waists.
