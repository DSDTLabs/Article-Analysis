NAGPUR: Beleaguered   leader Chhagan  , out on bail after two years in custody since his arrest in the alleged PWD scam, would be making a comeback at the party’s rally on June 10 in Pune. Bhujbal, who was seen to be extremely weakened after his arrest, would be addressing the rally to mark NCP’s foundation day. The event is also the last in a series of Halla Bol (protests rallies) against the BJP regime.

 Seen as a prominent leader of the Mali community and OBC segments, Bhujbal’s speech may also touch upon the hardships he faced in jail, said sources.
 
 Former union civil aviation minister and party spokesperson Praful   said that the massive rally has been planned to mark 20 years of formation of NCP. It is expected to be attended by over a lakh supporters. Bhujbal too would be speaking on the occasion.
 
 Patel also expressed concern about the medical attention Bhujbal received in custody, saying that he lost 15kg due to a stone blocking his pancreas. “An early diagnosis could have prevented much of his troubles. His condition was worse in the last one-and-a-half months due to the acute pain, and his condition could have deteriorated,” said Patel.
 
 Bhujbal is being seen as a prominent force to woo the OBC and Mali community, to which he belongs to. A weakened Bhujbal is also expected to draw much sympathy, which may help in the coming state elections, say sources. Along with him, Dhananjay Munde, nephew of deceased BJP leader Gopinath Munde, is also expected to attract the segment, said sources.
 
 The seventy-year-old Bhujbal was released last week after being arrested for money laundering and other irregularities. Prior to joining the NCP, he was in the Shiv Sena. On his release, Sena has reacted that destiny has avenged Bhujbal’s attempt to arrest Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray when he was in power.
