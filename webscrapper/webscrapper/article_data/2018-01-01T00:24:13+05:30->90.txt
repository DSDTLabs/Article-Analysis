Madurai: City police on Saturday arrested a seven-member gang for attacking N Abubacker, who was arrested by National Investigation Agency (NIA) in April 2017, in connection with serial bomb blast cases in court complexes in south India. The gang was hiding in a lodge in Chennai and was arrested with the help of Chennai police.

 The accused were identified as Mohammed Harun, Thoufiq Ali, Kiasuddin, Seeni Allah Pichai, Farooq Abdullah, Mohammed Ali and Abubacker Siddque. They were produced before a judicial magistrate and lodged in prison.
 
 Sources said that N Abubacker was arrested particularly in alleged connection with blast incident that took place in Malappuram court complex in Kerala. The blast took place inside a toilet in the complex in 2016. NIA, which was entrusted with the investigation, picked up Abubacker in April and subsequently lodged him in prison. While he came out on bail recently, he went to his brother Pichaikaniâ€™s shop in Vilakkuthoon on Wednesday.
 
 A 10-member gang, which came in search for him, attacked him. However, he escaped from the gang with minor injuries and was admitted in Government Rajaji Hospital. Based on a complaint from him, a case was registered and search was conducted for the accused. Meanwhile, Chennai police, who received information about the accused staying in a lodge in Triplicane, arrested them. A team from Madurai immediately rushed to Chennai and brought them back.
