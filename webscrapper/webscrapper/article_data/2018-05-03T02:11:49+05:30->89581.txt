NEW DELHI: The new financial year has started on a good note for Delhi government. The total   from Goods and Services   and Value Added Tax in April was an impressive Rs 2,468 crore. This is   higher than the Rs 1,812 crore collected in the same period in 2017.

 The implementation of the e-Way bill seems to have played a key role in boosting   by increasing compliance. The electronic document generated on the   portal for movement of goods valued higher than Rs 50,000 has helped prevent evasion of tax. 
 
 The bill also ensures tracking of goods and that they are in compliance with the GST law.
 
 Other contributing factors for the robust collection are the annual surge in tax payments at the fag end of the financial year and the GST regime bringing in greater transparency and scrutiny through digitisation.
 
 According to the trade and taxes department, April’s collection is a milestone because it marked Delhi crossing the Rs 2,072 crore 'break even' point for the second time since the rollout of GST. The break-up includes a State GST of Rs 1,331 crore, IGST of Rs 744 crore and   of Rs 397 crore. SGST and IGST add up to Rs 2,074 crore, Rs 2 crore beyond the break-even point.
 
 Delhi also moved to the positive side of the 14% cumulative growth target stipulated by the Centre. Since GST’s implementation in July last year, Delhi’s tax revenue has risen steadily. In October, GST crossed Rs 1,818 crore to go past the targeted 14% cumulative growth target. The trade and taxes department that month logged Rs 2,364 crore, including VAT of around Rs 500 crore.
 
 TOI reported on Tuesday that despite GST’s teething troubles, Delhi recorded a robust tax income of Rs 26,337 crore in 2017-18. The total, cumulative of VAT and GST, exceeded the government target of Rs 26,000 crore. This fiscal’s target is Rs 29,000 crore.
