Rajkot:   

 On Tuesday evening, Jairaj Gohel was playing with his friend Nilesh outside his house when the leopard hiding in the bushes suddenly pounced on Nilesh and tried to drag him away. Jairaj, however, did not run away and instead picked up a stone and hurled it at the wild cat. “When this did not deter the large cat, Jairaj picked up his electronic toy and threw it at the leopard. The toy started making a peculiar sound which rattled the leopard. It let go Nilesh,” said a senior forest department official in Jamwada range of Gir (west). 
 
 Pratap Rathod, principal of Arathiya Primary School where the boys study, told TOI, “Jairaj’s presence of mind and courage to fight a leopard is exemplary. The village sarpanch informed the forest department. They have placed cages to catch the leopard.”
 
 The forest department is planning to felicitate Jairaj for his bravery at a function in his school soon. 
 
 Leopard attacks are common in Gir-Somnath district with several wild cats seen in villages. The number of leopards in Gujarat has increased to 1,395 in 2015 from 1,160 in 2011 according to the census declared in 2016.
 
 Wildlife expert Priyvrat Gadhvi said, “Wild cats have an exceptionally good hearing, which leads them to their prey. But a loud, unnatural sound is likely to alarm them and may lead them to flee.”
