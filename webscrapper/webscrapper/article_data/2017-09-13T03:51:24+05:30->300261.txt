MUMBAI: Officials of the city cyber cell on Tuesday arrested a 25-year-old man from Mira Road who allegedly hacked into a Chembur youth’s email account, obtained his   details and password and transferred money into his own account and even did online shopping. The accused, Ashar Ayub Khan, cheated Swapnil Wagh of nearly Rs 2 lakh, said police officials. 

 The complainant told police that on August 24, he could not open his email account as his password was rejected. The next day, he got a text message on his phone stating that Rs 30,000 had been debited from his bank account. Wagh immediately contacted the bank and was shocked to learn that someone had transferred the money from his account as well as did online shopping and bought a Rs 400 mobile recharge. “Wagh only had Rs 69 left in his account. He lost a total Rs 1.8 lakh,” said a police officer. 
 
 Wagh lodged an FIR with the the cyber cell police who tracked the Rs 30,000 that was transferred to Khan’s bank account. They then arrested Khan from his Mira Road residence and booked him under the relevant IPC sections for cheating, forgery and breach of trust and also under the Information Technology (IT) Act.
