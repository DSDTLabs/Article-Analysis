NEW DELHI: A junior revenue official, a ‘patwari’ or land record keeper, managed to fully grasp the potential of his modest office to alter records relating to gram sabha (village common) land to spawn a scam that allowed him and his co-conspirator to skim off crores in   in south Delhi.

 According to an FIR filed by the  , Inderjeet, a  , facilitated tampering of records pertaining to around 25 bighas of land in connivance with one Mahesh. 
 
 Apart from this 25 bighas, the CBI is probing transfer of around 97 bighas of prime government land in Asola to private persons. The total 122 bighas would be worth Rs 600 crore at current market prices. A part of these transfers were linked to Inderjeet though all the changes took place during his tenure.
 
 In one of the FIRs registered to probe transfer of 25 bighas to Mahesh, the CBI claimed the “khasra girdawari” inspection report by revenue officers to verify land ownership and use and other reports were prepared in favour of Mahesh, who later sold 10 bighas out of it to one Raman Mehra.
 
 An enquiry showed that tampering in the   pertaining to gram sabha land in Asola was done after January 30, 2014 and before to April 24, 2015.
 
 After altering the records, a no-objection certificate was issued by Inderjeet and sale deed registered. Subsequently, mutation was done in favour of Mehra who made the purchase from Mahesh. The process allowed Mehra to become a bhumidaar (land owner) in place of the gram sabha without due process as per Delhi land revenue rules, 1962.
 
 In its enquiry report, the additional district magistrate (east) said, “It seems true that the said tampering was done during the tenure of Inderjeet patwari and hence he may be held responsible for the conspiracy behind the said tampering.”
 
 The CBI FIR suggested that Inderjeet tried to blame his assistants claiming that NoC and other reports were prepared by them even though he admitted they were not authorised to make a report or entries.
