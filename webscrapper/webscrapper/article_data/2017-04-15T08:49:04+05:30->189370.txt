JAIPUR: Four girls died in   on Friday after they fell into a pit filled with water near   area of the district. All the four bodies were recovered and handed over to the family members for final rites.

 According to additional SP  , the incident took place when 15-year-old Guddu was grazing the cattle near the pit and suddenly fell into it. “Another girl   (9) jumped into the pit to save her friend but died. Similarly, other girls, Nishu (7) and   (10), too fell into pit while trying to rescue others,” Dixit said, adding that incident took place when the kids were grazing cattle and fell into several feet deep pit.
 
 At 12 pm, the parents of the girls went to nearby areas to search for their children but couldn’t find them; hence, they informed the police about the case. “We carried out a search operation in the area spoke to several people about the movements of children. The villagers informed us that girls were last seen near a hill. When we reached the area, we could see their bodies floating over the pit,” the police official said.
 
 The police and villagers fished out the bodies of the children and sent them for autopsy at a district hospital in the area. However, the villagers alleged that pit was created for mining purpose and the contractors did not take any safety measures to cover it. “Although we haven’t received any such complaint yet, but if anybody informs us then we will look into the matter,” the police official said.
 
 The gloom descended as soon as the bodies of the young kids arrived in the villager from the mortuary.
