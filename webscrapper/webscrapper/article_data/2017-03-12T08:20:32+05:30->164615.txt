PANAJI/IMPHAl: 
  and 
  threw up fractured mandates on Saturday, with Congress and BJP staking claim to form governments in both the states.

 While Congress won 17 out of Goa’s 40 seats, BJP was just behind with 13; it also has the support of an Independent candidate backed by it. Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) with three seats, Goa Forward Party (3) and NCP (1) were sitting on the fence, with all three being wooed by Congress and BJP. Of these, MGP is an erstwhile ally of BJP.
 
 In Manipur, Congress, fighting three-term incumbency, bagged 28 out of 60 seats. BJP put up a solid fight, winning 21 seats. In the 2012 elections, the saffron party hadn’t won a single seat. Congress now needs to win over the lone Trinamool Congress legislator, as well as an Independent, who happens to be a Muslim, to reach 30, still one short of the magic figure of 31.
 
 BJP is banking on late former Speaker PA Sangma’s NPP, Ram Vilas Paswan’s LJP and Naga People’s Front (NPF) as all three are NDA allies. These parties hold nine seats in all and leave the BJP with 30 seats.
 
 The Trinamool MLA is being pursued by both the national parties as he could swing the fortunes either way. 
 
 LJP had supported Congress in the last government, but is now part of NDA. “As Congress is the single largest party, we expect governor Najma Heptullah to follow the tradition and invite us to form the government,” a senior Congress functionary said.
