BHUBANESWAR: Former minister and senior   leader Surya Narayan Patro on Monday said oil minister   is acting like a spokesperson of Chhattisgarh on Mahandi water sharing dispute. 

 A day after Dharmendra attacked chief minister   for rejecting the negotiation committee formed by the Centre to resolve the dispute, Patro said, "The oil minister is trying to keep Chhattisgarh regime in good humour because he aspires to re-enter the Rajya Sabha from the neighbouring state after his current tenure in the upper house from Bihar expires in 2018."
 
 "People of Odisha will never forgive those acting against the state's interest, the people will give them a befitting reply," Patro told reporters here.Responding to Patro's jibe on Dharmendra, BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said, "The senior BJD leader seems to be speaking in such a tone to appease his master (Naveen Patnaik), as he had earlier described himself as a servant ."
