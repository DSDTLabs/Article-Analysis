Sony said on Tuesday it would pay about $2.3 billion to gain control of  , becoming the world’s largest music publisher in an industry that has found new life on the back of streaming services.

 
 The acquisition is the biggest strategic move yet by new CEO Kenichiro  . The deal is part of Yoshida’s mission to make revenue streams more stable with rights to entertainment content — a strategy that follows a major revamp by his predecessor which shifted Sony’s focus away from low-margin consumer electronics.
 
 “This investment in content intellectual property is a key stepping stone for our long-term growth,” he told a news conference. The deal values   at $4.8 billion including debt, more than double the $2.2 billion value given in 2011 when a consortium led by Sony won bidding rights for the company.
 
 Sony, which has run the business since then, will buy a 60% stake owned by  , lifting its ownership to around 90% from 30% currently. EMI currently commands 15% of the music publishing industry — which combined with its   business would make the Japanese giant the industry leader with market share of 26%, a company spokesman said.
