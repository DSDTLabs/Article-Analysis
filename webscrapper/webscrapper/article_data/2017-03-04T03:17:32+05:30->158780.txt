NEW DELHI: Former finance minister   said the CSO figures for the third quarter showing steady growth were misleading, and argued that the economy had taken a hit because of demonetisation.

 The   member said the best way to judge the impact of demonetisation on the economy was to take the Gross Value Addition (GVA) without the sectors which were unaffected by the currency ban — agricultural production, subsidies and utility services. If the GVA was calculated without the three sectors, it would come down from 8.76% for Q1 to around 5% in Q3, he said, adding that the GVA for 2016-17 showed a declining trend. “You will find in Q4 that the economy was hit very badly by demonetisation,” he said.
 
 Even as he painted a grim picture, Chidambaram called the Modi government the “most anti-intellectual government” which saw Oxford, Harvard, Cambridge and Nobel laureate   as worthless -- a retaliation to PM Narendra Modi’s recent jibe about “Harvard and hard work”.
 
 Lawyer and Congress MP   called currency ban a BJP-authored scam about illegal exchange of black money in banks and demanded a JPC probe. Former Planning Commission vice-chairman and economist Montek Singh Ahluwalia said GVA minus the sectors unaffected by demonetisation showed a deceleration of growth. He said the real economic impact of demonetisation was on the informal sector, on which the government did not have figures.
