A murder case has been registered on a complaint by Naresh's fatherin-law,“ said the SHO." 
 
 Naresh had voluntarily retired from BSF and was running a small grocery shop near a hospital in Bahadurgarh. Around 2 pm, three men on a motorcycle reached near his shop. Their faces were covered with masks and helmets. Before Naresh could realize their intention, two of them opened fire and escaped waving firearms in the air.
 
 Soon after, Jhajjar additional superintendent of police (ASP) Sawan Kumar and deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Rajiv Kumar rushed to the spot.
