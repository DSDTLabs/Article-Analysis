Jalandhar: Solving the case of murder of youth Sunny, 26, in a mini-bus near village Nahlan between Adamopur and Bhogpur in the afternoon on Saturday, Jalandhar Rural police have arrested victimâ€™s friend, Balihar, who was also the complainant. During investigations, it turned out that Balihar was the mastermind and got Sunny to implicate Sukhwinder Singh alias Kukkad, for whose kidnapping they were facing the trial in a Hoshiarpur court. 

 Sunny and Balihar were returning from Hoshiarpur after appearing in the court when Sunny was hacked to death by two persons who came on a bike with another accomplice and waylaid the bus.
 
 SSP Gurpreet Singh Bhullar said apart from Sunny and Balihar, four other accused were facing trial in the kidnapping case. Sunny had a rivalry with Sukhwinder Kukkad over affair with a girl due to which he kidnapped the latter around a year and half back. He said that negotiations had taken place between the two sides but Sukhwinder had allegedly demanded Rs 8 lakh from them for settling the kidnapping case.
 
 Bhullar said Balihar hatched a conspiracy with other co-accused that they would attack Sunny and name Sukhwinder in the case to be able to settle it without paying any money. He said that while two more accused in the case, Harman Singh alias Honey and Jagmeet alias Lucky, had been identified and those who executed the murder would also be identified after their arrest.
 
 On Saturday, three motorcycle borne youths, with covered faces, had stopped the mini-bus which Sunny and Balihar boarded from Adampur around 2.30pm near Nahlan. As soon as they entered the bus, they allegedly attacked Sunny with sharp-edged weapons. They hit Sunny in the chest and died on the spot. Balihar, one of the accused, had alleged that Sukhwinder and another youth entered the bus and attacked Sunny while their third accomplice remained on the motorcycle for quick escape.
