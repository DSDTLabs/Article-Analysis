MUMBAI:   on Thursday said   and   will have to take action on complaints of illegal sale of exotic birds and animals from across the city, and not restrict it to  .

 The court had on April 10 directed them to stop the illegal sale, while hearing a public interest litigation, which said these   openly sell exotic species like jungle fowls, macaws, hornbills, peacocks, munias, parakeets and mynahs. The Maharashtra Legal Services Authority (MALSA) member secretary was directed to himself or through his deputy, conduct a surprise visit and submit a report with pictures depicting the exact position.
 
 MALSA’s report said there are 20-30 pet shops with boards at Crawford Market, known as pet food shops. However, since they were shut down no business was being carried out. Only one shop sold pet food but there were no animals up for sale. On enquiry, two persons were willing to sell tortoises but said they are not available at the shops but were kept elsewhere.
 
 The petitioner’s advocate said the business has shifted to Kurla and Borivli. BMC’s advocate said they were not being sold in municipal markets. “Even if they are not part of the market area, such activity cannot be allowed to continue as its illegal,’’ said the bench, adding that both areas come under BMC and police jurisdiction. The judges said their April 10 order cannot be restricted to Crawford Market, and whenever such activity is brought to the notice of any BMC official or police, they must take action on the complaints. “Inaction of these offices on such complaints can always be brought to court as the matter is kept pending,’’ they added.
