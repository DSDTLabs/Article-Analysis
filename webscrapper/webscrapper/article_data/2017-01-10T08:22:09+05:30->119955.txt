JAMMU: J&K chief minister   said on Monday that the   of 2016 summer was a conspiracy hatched by Pakistan and Kashmiri  . The five-month cycle of protest and violence that unfolded after the killing of Hizbul commander   on July 8 had left more than 90 people dead.

 Replying to a debate in the assembly on last year’s violence,   said, “When issues like   and Sainik Colony did not work, the killing of Burhan Wani was used to trigger the unrest. Pakistan and separatists derailed the dialogue process by shutting doors on the all-party delegation because they had made preparations for the unrest beforehand,” she said.
 
 Strongly defending the administrative action against rioters, the CM said, “It’s easy to say that security forces could have exercised restraint, but when a mob attacks a police station with petrol bombs, stones and axes, it becomes difficult.
 
  At present, only 138 people involved in the summer violence are in judicial or police custody. All others who were arrested in the cases have been released on bail,” she said. Mehbooba announced the setting up of an SIT to probe the killings and to ascertain if excessive force was used during the summer turmoil.
