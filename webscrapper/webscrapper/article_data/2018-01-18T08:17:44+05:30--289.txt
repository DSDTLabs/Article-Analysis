AHMEDABAD: What would a raga ‘look’ like? The question isn’t new as evinced by the   paintings of 17th century in India. But the question that today’s  ,   had set out to solve in his young days as an architect in Vadodara deals more with whether music can be sufficiently modular to be understood by all, irrespective of approach –   or Indian vs Western.

  “Both architecture and music work on mathematics and set rules,” says Vadnerkar, now in his 80s. “We have swarlipi, whereas the West has staff notations. I thought of simplifying it in a way that it can encompass both Indian and Western systems.”
 
 How does his system work? Vadnerkar has made a grid of 16x12 squares representing one octave. While the horizontal plane shows progression (rhythm), the vertical plane represents scales. Each scale is demarcated by a different colour whereas a full note is depicted by four squares, half by two, quarter by one, eighth by half and sixteenth by quarter of a square. With advent of computer technology, Vadnerkar says that any song can be converted into a musicograph. The colours assigned to different notes are inspired by traditional colours associated with classical ragas.
 
 “With the uniform understanding of such visual representation of music, I can show common elements in a number of Russian compositions and Indian counterparts. It removes barriers between different notations across the world,” says Vadnerkar, while accepting that his system has not been followed widely even as he has made a number of presentations on the subject in India and abroad.
 
 One of the criticisms his system has faced is that it does not fully represent the complexity of a musical system. But Vadnerkar keeps improving it while also taking his system to the audience such as schoolchildren, who are taking their first steps towards learning music.
