HYDERABAD: Ever since T-agitation started in 2009, Hyderabad saw a huge dip in its number of   (FTA). From 7.5 lakh FTA in 2009, the number dipped to 2.9 lakh in 2010 and 75,171 in 2014. But the  's latest numbers show FTAs rising to 1,48,629 (up to November) in 2016.

 While city registered an overall rise in FTA by 47%, the number dropped by 33% in November. "The Centre's demonetisation move might have forced several foreign tourists to postpone their plans," said a tourism department official.
 
 Industry experts attribute the rise in FTAs to a politically stable government. "During the Telangana movement, a lot of foreigners kept Hyderabad out of their itinerary due to agitations. But now, things are slowly returning to normalcy," said manager of Lakdiapool-based Sri Sai Travels, Mahesh Pant.
 
 The fall in FTAs since 2010 had severely affected the hospitality industry apart from the pearls business in the Old City.
 
 Representatives from the meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) sector observe that the city's tourism has developed post-bifurcation. Many also attribute the rise in FTAs to city's recently earned reputation of being a hub for medical tourism."
 
 Even the state government offers incentives to foreigners to visit the city for treatment. Several hotels and hospitals have tied up to offer packages to foreigners," said   secretary, Jagdish Rao.
