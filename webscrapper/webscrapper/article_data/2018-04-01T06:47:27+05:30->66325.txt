MUMBAI: The festival of  , the greatest occasion of joy for Christians worldwide, will be celebrated on Sunday. It signifies Jesus Christ’s resurrection from the grave two days after he was crucified on Good Friday.

 The abstinence of Lent ended on Friday, and celebrations began at Easter mass on Saturday evening. The archbishop of Bombay Oswald Cardinal Gracias conducted mass at Holy Name Cathedral at 8pm.
 
 The service at   in Parksite, Vikhroli, bore a unique touch. Fr   celebrated the Risen Christ with a song from the Hindi film Ram Balram. He sang for the congregation, ‘Humse bhool ho gayi, hamka maafi de do’. He said to TOI: “My theme for Easter is forgive and forget, so it fits well, doesn’t it?” Then he soberly said that the best way to spread the message of Christ’s sacrifice is to use humour and music to draw and retain attention.
 
 Catholics and non-Catholics alike enjoy the sweets that are prepared on this festival. The aroma of confectionery permeates the air, in Bandra West in particular, for the large number of bakeries and home chefs who prepare Easter goodies in this suburb.
 
 
 Young Angie D’Souza of Home Fork serves traditional marzipan, milk cream and chocolate eggs and sweets delightfully shaped like yellow chicks, bunny rabbits and bonnets. “We use rum essence for rum cakes since real rum requires a liquor licence. Our barbecue pork and roast is very popular too,” she says.
 
 
 Malad has an assortment of great cooks too. Johanna D’Souza of Jojo’s, Orlem, says, “We have an Easter surprise egg which is filled with chocolate bunnies. Light fruit cake which is a vanilla base with cranberries, apricot and raisin is very popular. Apart from that there are varieties like marzipan, chocolate fudge, rum and raisin, vodka and cranberry, and coconut.”
