VADODARA: Wary of stricter law for illegal slaughterhouses, abattoirs operating without permission in Godhra have downed their shutters voluntarily. Curiously, Godhra that has a   of non-vegetarians does not have a single licenced slaughterhouse. The only licenced facility was badly damaged about a decade back during a storm and has not been taken care of after that. 

 Municipal councillor   said that there were sellers who used to sell meat on the street in her locality. "None of them are seen in the area any more. The sale of meat without permission has almost stopped. Those in the business are mostly illiterate people who do not understand the law. Elders in the community explained the situation to them," she said. 
 
 Activist Hanif Haji, who is also an elected councillor, said that the issue of illegal abattoirs in Godhra had been blown out of proportion. "The activity had stopped since quite some time. The   also advised community members against operating illegal slaughterhouses," he said. Even cow vigilantes agree that illegal slaughterhouses have come to a grinding halt. "We knew about 17 such establishments over a year back. After the new law passed by the assembly, they have stopped operations," said  , a self-proclaimed gau rakshak.
 
 Bhaijamal, however, said that there was need to give licences for operating slaughterhouses legitimately. "There are families for whom this was the only means of earning. They can be allowed to work within the framework of law by keeping an eye on their activities," she said.
 
 Godhra municipality sanitary inspector   said that the municipality was no more responsible for the slaughterhouses and the food and drugs department was now in charge. "But the municipality had not been giving licences as there was no establishment with proper facilities in the town," he said.
