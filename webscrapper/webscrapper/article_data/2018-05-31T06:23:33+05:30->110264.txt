 Raghavan said Mallya is not in a position to pay money as all his accounts have been frozen. He said about Rs 1,200 crore is lying in deposits with the  .
 
 After hearing both sides for close to one-and-a-half hours, a division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari adjourned the hearing to June 1.

 Mallya had challenged this order only in October 2017 and the same was dismissed on January 2, 2018 for non-appearance. Subsequently, he filed two applications and they were dismissed for not complying with March 28, 2018 order which required him to pre-deposit Rs 3,101 crore with DRAT, Chennai.
