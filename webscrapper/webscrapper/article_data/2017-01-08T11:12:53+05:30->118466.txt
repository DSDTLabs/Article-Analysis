PANAJI: Passengers landing in Goa during the monsoons no longer need to worry about getting wet in the rain, with   Airport, Dabolim all set to get three new aerobridges for the new domestic and international terminal.

  has started preliminary work for the installation of three new aerobridges at  . The project is estimated to cost Rs 12 crores.
 
 “The aerobridges are likely to be ready and commissioned by April 2017. Each aerobridge costs around Rs 4 crores inclusive of the cost of installation and commissioning,” an AAI official said.
 
 Goa International airport already has five aerobridges. With the installation of the three new aerobridges, all the eight parking bays available at the Naval-controlled airport will be connected through aerobridges.
 
 “Airlines, too, will benefit as they will not require the use of coaches for ferrying of passengers between parking bays and the new terminal building,” said airport director B C H Negi.
 
 The contract to supply and install the new aerobridges has been awarded to a Spanish company, but AAI officials chose not to reveal the name of the company.
 
 The AAI operated airport handles over 5.8 million passengers annually, with quite a few international tourists passing through the airport. The airport has often drawn flak for its haphazard layout and the manner in which passengers are ferried to the aircraft.
