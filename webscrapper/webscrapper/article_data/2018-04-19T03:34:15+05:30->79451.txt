KOLKATA: The killing of a   in Jhargram’s Lalgarh has snowballed into a high-voltage political faceoff between the Centre and the state after Union minister   said Bengal is the only state in the country where animals are in danger.

 Referring to the ‘Shikar Utsav’ hunting festival, Maneka claimed that thousands of animals were killed every year and said the festival should be banned immediately. “Thousands of so-called tribals come to the forests around Lalgarh and kill thousands of animals every year. They are being used by smugglers and poachers, and the state forest department has done nothing about this.”
 
 In response, Banerjee said: “How did she know   was held? Did she use a telescope? A tiger died and curious people came to see it. How can she compare this with Shikar Utsav?”
 
 She added: “With people like them in the Cabinet, the government and the nation are in a precarious situation. In her bid to insult Bengal, she has insulted Adivasis. People of all communities live in harmony in Bengal. She does not understand this culture. Their culture is creati-ng divisions among people.”
 
 Banerjee also took exception to the Union minister’s “so-called tribal” remark. “She said Adivasis are poachers and torture animals. She should apologise to the community,” the CM said.
 
 “A tiger has died. How did she know it was killed by Adivasis? Common people were living in fear. It injured villagers who went to collect kendu leaves. Two persons are in hospital,” the CM added.
 
 Maneka also accused the CM of not acting against the culprits to save her vote ba-nk. “Bengal is the only place in India where such illegality is allowed and encouraged. It is important to stop Shikar Utsav here,” she said.
