Hyderabad: Hit by lower sales in North America, city-based pharma giant Dr Reddy’s Laboratories ( ) on Saturday announced a 16% drop in net profit for the third quarter of FY17 at Rs 492.3 crore as compared to Rs 585.7 crore in the year ago period. This was on 6.4% dip in total income to Rs 3,723.2 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2016, as against Rs 3,979.7 crore in the corresponding quarter of FY16.

 Segment-wise, global generics revenues declined to Rs 3,063.8 crore in the third quarter of FY17 as compared to Rs 3,355.8 crore in the year ago period. In the global generics segment, North America contributed Rs 1,659.5 crore (Rs 1,941.7 crore in the year ago period), Europe Rs 214.8 crore (Rs 193.7), Rs 594.7 crore (Rs 580.5 crore) and emerging markets Rs 594.8 crore (Rs Rs 639.9 crore).
 
 According to DRL’s president and chief financial officer Saumen Chakraborty, the generics business revenues from North America declined in Q3 primarily on account of increased competition in Valgancyclovir (anti-viral drug) and its injectables franchise. The company also faced pricing pressure in the market, he added.
 
 Explaining the macro trends in the US market, DRL COO Abhijit Mukherjee said, “The channel has consolidated largely between four entities controlling over 80% of the market, which naturally puts pressure on suppliers. The second thing is that if you are late in approval, the value creation is more subdued than what it used to be in the past. Additionally, I think there is a lot of rigour in the FDA, especially in complex generics approvals.” 
 
 On expectations from the fourth quarter, he pointed out that the company is expecting few approvals to come through. “…Some of them are getting pushed out to next year. It is not going to be an active quarter. We see some headwinds and erosion,” he added.
 
 DRL is also gearing up for USFDA inspection of its three units by March. The three units -- API facilities at Srikakulam (Andhra Pradesh) and Miryalaguda (Telangana) and an oncology formulations facility at Duvvada (Visakhapatnam) – had come under the USFDA scanner in 2015 end. 
 
 Meanwhile, commenting on the results, DRL co-chairman and CEO G V Prasad said in a statement, “Our performance in Q3 has delivered a modest sequential revenue growth of 3% over the previous quarter. Our EBITDA has improved significantly from the last quarter to Rs 8.8 billion on the back of enhanced emphasis on operational efficiencies and controlling of SG&A (selling, general and administrative) costs across all our businesses.”
