NAGPUR: The city is likely to get a state-of-the-art   with seating capacity of 25,000. The plan is to turn the proposed Vasantrao Naik Memorial Auditorium into an amphitheatre project.

 Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) and district administration plan to develop the amphitheatre project in sprawling 7 acre land between Futala Square on Amravati Road and RTMNU Vice-Chancellor’s official bungalow, in West Nagpur.
 
 At the inaugural programme of Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) Suresh   auditorium on September 22 last year, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had announced there were plans to construct an amphitheatre with a seating capacity of about 10,000-15,000. “The high court had imposed a ban on conduct of any events at Kasturchand Park (KP), and Yashwant Stadium. There is no other open space available for events like musical concerts, exhibitions, social and cultural activities,” he had said.
 
 Sources from the district administration and NIT told TOI that Naik auditorium project has been changed into the amphitheatre project. “Bhat auditorium in Reshimbagh has seating capacity of 2,000 and was constructed properly by NMC. Vasantrao Deshpande Hall in Civil Lines has capacity of 900. But the city lacks an amphitheatre, which is a must for growing cultural and social activities,” sources said.
 
 They added that the amphitheatre will be developed on the lines of one constructed at Bhopal. “The stage will be a covered structure. Seating arrangements will be like a stadium, but in the shape of an amphitheatre so that the stage is visible to all very clearly. Provision of parking and other basic amenities will be provided,” the sources said.
 
 It is learnt that famous architect Ashok Mokha, who designed the Bhat auditorium, has been given the task of preparing the design for the amphitheatre project too.
 
 Divisional commissioner Anup Kumar, collector Sachin Kurve, and NIT chairman Deepak Mhaisekar will take a final decision on land allotment in a meeting at the month end. The district administration had leased out the proposed land to RTMNU. For this project, RTMNU has reportedly returned the land to the district administration.
 
 If everything goes as per plan, the project’s execution can be expected soon, as the state government had already sanctioned Rs20 crore for Naik auditorium project. As part of the centenary celebrations of former CM Vasantrao Naik, the state had organized various programmes between July 1, 2012, and June 30, 2013. The then chief minister Prithviraj Chavan had announced construction of an auditorium in the city, and also released the funds. NIT was appointed as nodal agency for execution of the project.
