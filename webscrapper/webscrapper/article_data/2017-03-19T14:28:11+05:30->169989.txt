Actor   is looking forward to the forthcoming 'Munna Bhai' film and says he will be after filmmaker   if there is no role for him in the movie. 

 The 57-year-old-actor appeared in Hirani's debut film 'Munna Bhai MBBS' and went on to collaborate with the director in films like 'Lage Raho Munna Bhai', ' ' and 'PK'. 
 
 Recently, the director announced he would be making the third installment of the 'Munna Bhai' series and Boman could not be more excited. 
 
  
  
 "I am looking forward to it too. Circuit and Munna would be the automatic choice for the film, not me. The third character is always the floating, fresh character. There should be a character available for me, but I would terrorise Rajkumar Hirani if there isn't a character for me," Boman said. 
 
 "Right now, he (Hirani) is busy with the Dutt biopic. So once that finishes, we go into Munna Bhai space," he adds. 
 
 In the first part, Boman played the role of Dr Asthana while in the second, he was an unscrupulous businessman called Lucky Singh.
