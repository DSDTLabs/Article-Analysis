PANAJI: Over 11 months after the BJP-led government took over, guidelines for preparation of the Regional Plan (RP) 2030 are yet to be finalized.

 The Economic Survey for the year 2017-18 states that the government has plans to prepare a new plan with a horizon year of 2030 - almost a decade ahead.
 
 Goa had commenced the process of preparing a RP in the late 1990s. The RP 2011 had to be scrapped due to large-scale conversion of eco-sensitive zones for commercial development and other reasons.
 
 The new RP 2021 was later released in instalments. But, despite an uproar over glaring errors, it was notified without corrections. The state remained in the planning mode for about 20 years.
 
 Further, the report states that the process of rectification or corrections in RP 2021 related to talukas of Sattari, Pernem and   have been completed.
 
 Further, the Economic Survey refers to creation of two posts of chief town planners and other proposals, but no mention is made about inclusion of villages in Bambolim, Kadamba plateau and other planning areas, which have now raised a huge row, even as some villages in   have initiated moves to oppose them.
