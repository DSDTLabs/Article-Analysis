LUCKKNOW: There was much more than what met the eyes at the coronation of   as   at the   attended by 10 chief ministers of the   and its allies and powerful Union ministers, by Prime Minister  , here on Sunday. 

 The swearing in ceremonies of chief ministers in Uttarakhand, Goa and many states where the BJP won elections in 2015 and 2016 were just a formal takeoff of the new government. But presence of former deputy prime minister Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Union minister Uma Bharti, who have all been the flag-bearers of the Ram Janmabhumi movement since the 1980s heralded a saffron surge. Advani and Joshi hardly ever attended any such function in the recent past. 
 
 As Modi and Yogi waved at the supporters from the stage, amid shouting of slogans like 'Ek hi nara ek hi naam, Jai Shri Ram Jai Shri Ram,' it reminded one of the heady days of the 1990s when the saffron wave swept the entire state and such slogans echoed everywhere. 
 
 Gorakhpur is the only parliamentary constituency where the Mathadheesh (head priest) of the Gorakhdham Mandir has been winning since the first election in 1952 and whether BJP is in power or not, the seat has been in possession of Mahant Digvijaynath followed by Mahant Avaidyanath and now Yogi Adityanath who has won it five times at the age of 44. 
 
 This is the only temple in the country from where Mathadheesh enjoys reverence as far as in adjoining Nepal. 
 
 After Modi , it was the Yogi who was in high demand and given two helicopters to tour for poll campaign. Yogi has been popular for his inflammatory speeches and direct attack on his political and religious rivals and now BJP has elevated him to post of UP chief minister to pursue their agenda and policies. BJP has now left no doubts about its aggressive pursuit of the Hindutva agenda.
