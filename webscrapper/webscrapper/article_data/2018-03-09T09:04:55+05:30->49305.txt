AMARAWATI: The   may be growing in strength across the country, with the northeast being its latest domain, but it will have a tough time in expanding its base in   on its own.

 With the BJP-TDP alliance appearing to be tottering, BJP sources said there was a very vocal section within the party that had opposed the alliance with the TDP and who would be a happier lot now. They include those of the RSS background led by MLA Somu Veeraraju and those who joined the BJP from the Congress, including Daggubati Purandeswari, Kanna Lakshminarayana and  .
 
 But the state BJP as a whole need to worry as it would face a tough task in improving the last election tally of two Lok   and four assembly seats on its own. In the past in united AP, the BJP could never make a mark contesting in the elections on its own. This time around, with both the YSR Congress and the TDP now portraying it as the villain in the whole drama, it would be very tough for the BJP to gain the confidence of the AP electorate.
 
 Another major drawback that the BJP faces in gaining strength in AP is that it does not have a charismatic or dynamic leader of the statue of Naidu or Jagan to woo the electorate on its own strength. The only leader who had a mass appeal is M  , who, having become the Vice-President, has to now stay away from politics as he holds a constitutional post.
 
 The BJP’s fortunes could change for the better if it strikes an alliance with the YSR Congress. “But such an alliance can work to their advantage only if both their vote banks remain intact after the alliance. Otherwise, the minorities could desert Jagan and the BJP could lose the little Hindutva votes it has in the state.
