AHMEDABAD:   has gathered momentum after the first spells of rains in the state. Nearly 25.87 lakh hectares of land has been sown, which is 10 lakh hectares than at the same time last year.

 According to data released by the state government, sowing has been completed on 30% of the 85.76 lakh hectares normally sown. Interestingly, this time round a higher proportion of the sowing completed has been for   rather than cotton. Groundnut has been sown on 7.46 lakh hectares, about 54% of the 13.88 lakh hectares normally sown with the crop. 
 
 Officials said that through the total area sown with cotton is greater, the fibre crop has so far been sown only on 46.50% of its usual acreage. Sources said groundnut sowing was rising as the government has started buying groundnut at the minimum support price (MSP), while cotton growers are facing the threat of disease, which is lowering productivity.
 
 State government officials said that this year, about 92 talukas have received 20% more   than normal so far. Some 144 talukas have received 10% more but not 20% more rainfall than normal.
 
 Officials said sowing has been greatest in Saurashtra, where about 17.61 lakh hectares have been sown. It is followed by north   and central Gujarat, where 3.25 lakh hectares and 3.04 lakh hectares have been sown, respectively.
 
 According to officials, in Saurashtra, 6.76 lakh hectares has been sown with groundnut and 9.49 lakh hectares with cotton, so far. Officials said the area sown with groundnut and cotton this year is almost double the area from the same date last year.
