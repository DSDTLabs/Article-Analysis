Legendary writer Kumaran Asan’s Karuna was about a rich and accomplished courtesan, Vasavadatta, from Mathura, who falls in love with a Buddhist monk, Upagupta, only to eventually find spiritual happiness on taking refuge in the Buddha. This is a tale that has had cinematic and theatrical interpretations in  , and now, it is time for director Mahadevan (of   and My Dear Mummy fame) to weave it together for a larger audience, as he brings   to life in a film of the same name in all four south Indian languages and, perhaps, even Hindi.

 Playing the title character in the film is  , who will start shooting for the film in February. “I am very excited to play this role of a mythological character. There is a lot of mystery surrounding her and that is what piqued my interest. This film is going to be shot in the backdrops of the forts of Rajasthan, Halebeedu, Mysuru, etc.,” says Sanjjanaa. 
 
 “Doing a period film has been a long cherished dream, the inspiration being director Bharathan’s Vaisali. My team suggested that we look at Kumaran Asan’s poem on Vasavadatta. We are looking at capturing the life and times of Vasavadatta in a positive tone. The initial plan was to make it a bilingual in   and Malayalam, but the subject is such that it will appeal to other audiences as well, so we decided to include Tamil, Telugu and Hindi as well, all of which will be shot simultaneously. The rest of the cast will include actors who are active in all these industries. The technical team comprises a bunch of known names, including art director Manu Jagadh, who worked on Baahubali, cinematographer   and National Award-winner for costume design, SB Sathish, among others,” says Mahadevan.
