JAIPUR: For improving city’s sanitation, the   (JMC) has decided to distribute free garbage bins to household and  .

 Initially, these garbage bins will be provided to the small vendors sitting at footpaths and makeshift cart owners. Later on, household in the city will be provided with the bins. A Delhi-based firm has provided the sample of a dustbin to JMC. The cost of one bin would be Rs 108, said an official. 
 
 “There is a small hole at the bottom of the bin so that residents do not use it for other purposes. The Central government has also identified some firms to purchase these bins. Many private firms will also be roped in for assistance under corporate social responsibility. Bins will carry sticker of Swacch Bharat,” said a JMC official.
 
 The practice already prevails in Dungarpur and Udaipur. “Once the door-to-door garbage collection starts residents can dispose the garbage collected in the bin. This would improve the garbage collection system,” the official added.
 
 JMC would start the door-to-door garbage collection scheme from   next month. To initiate the scheme systematically, the city mayor also took a meeting in civil zones last week. “JMC fears protests as many residents and sanitation workers are against the scheme. Earlier too, the scheme failed due to violent protest by sanitation workers,” he added.
 
 JMC will launch door-to-door collection of solid waste in all 91 wards of the city. For door-to-door collection in municipal corporation, it is proposed that the awarded organization will levy Rs 40 for a plot size less than 100 square yards, Rs 50 for a plot size more than 100 square yards. For shops in colonies and market areas, Rs 80 has been fixed and for restaurants Rs 100.
