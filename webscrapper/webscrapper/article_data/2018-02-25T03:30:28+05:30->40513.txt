NEW DELHI: Ending the over-a-year-long imbroglio, low-cost carrier   on Saturday said it will move some of its domestic flights from Delhi airport’s Terminal 1D to  . The apex court had on Friday refused to grant relief to IndiGo in Delhi International Airport Ltd’s (DIAL) decision to shift partial flight operations from T1D to T2.

 “IndiGo deferentially accepts the decision of the apex court and shall implement the order in the coming weeks, in close coordination with Delhi International Airport Limited,” IndiGo said in a statement. An airport official said that IndiGo will submit a proposal by March 3 and then DIAL will respond to the same by March 13. As per SC’s Friday order, shifting of flights should take place within the next 24 days.
 
  airport’s T1D has to be decongested so that its expansion work can begin. GoAir (which has only domestic operations) had already shifted all its flights to T2 last October. DIAL wanted to shift IndiGo and SpiceJet flights between Delhi and Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru from T2 only. Now, which all flights are shifted remains to be seen.
 
 T1D has a capacity of handling two crore passengers annually. It is, however, expected to handle 2.6 crore flyers the financial year ending March 31, 2018, explaining the serious overcrowding in peak hours. DIAL plans to expand its capacity to four crore passengers per annum by 2020-21 but the work, it says, can begin only after one-third flights move out of T1D. The expanded Terminal 1 will have 22 aerobridges apart from 15 boarding gates from where flyers will take buses to planes.
 
 Now with airlines agreeing to the shift, the much-delayed expansion work of IGI may finally begin.
 
 The IndiGo statement issued on Saturday said: “By its order dated February 23, 2018, the   of India has declined to interfere with the judgment of the division bench of Delhi high court, which upheld the decision of DIAL to shift one-third of IndiGo’s operations from Terminal 1D to Terminal 2 of IGI airport.”
 
 “IndiGo has maintained consistently in all forums that shifting of only a part of its operations from Terminal 1D to Terminal 2 would not only cause grave inconvenience and confusion amongst passengers, it will also reduce flight options for passengers connecting through Delhi. By virtue of the said order, IndiGo will be one of the only two airlines to operate from three different terminals of one airport,” IndiGo added.
