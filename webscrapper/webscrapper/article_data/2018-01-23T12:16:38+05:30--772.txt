 has already made history as the first Indian woman to sign a   developmental contract, but the former   competitor added a new accolade to her resume this past weekend: Presidential honouree.

 
 In a ceremony held Saturday in the Indian capital of New Delhi, Devi was one of 112 women honoured as the country’s “First Ladies” by President  . The First Lady designation pays homage to high-achieving female pioneers. The ceremony was promoted by India’s Ministry of Women & Child Development.
 
 Honourees came from a variety of fields, such as sports, business and defense. Other honourees included Bachendri Pal, the first Indian woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest, and Radhika Menon, the first female Merchant Navy Captain.
 
 Devi is not only the first Indian woman to sign with WWE, but she was also the first Indian woman to ever compete in a WWE ring, as part of last summer’s Mae Young Classic. A student of former World Heavyweight Champion The Great Khali, Devi is expected to report for training at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Fla., in the coming weeks.
