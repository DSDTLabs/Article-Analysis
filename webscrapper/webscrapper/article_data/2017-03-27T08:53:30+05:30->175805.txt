NEW DELHI: Two days after a 16-year-old youth was   by his friend in east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar, police have found the CCTV footage from the area, which shows how the entire episode unfolded.

 The footage first shows the victim running away from the accused, but is later   and   by him until he collapses. Locals said that they bashed the victim after the incident, but he managed to free himself from them and fled. 
 
 The accused, Babban, knew the victim, Junaid, since childhood. Family members told the cops that the Babban stayed in the same colony as Junaid.
 
 Following his afternoon prayers on Friday, Junaid met Babban near their colony. Locals said that they both were having an argument which turned nasty and Babban started thrashing Junaid before stabbing him.
 
 A passerby informed the police, who took Junaid to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead. Based on eye witness accounts, police registered a case against Babban and arrested him from his residence.
 
 At first he denied having murdered Junaid, but on sustained interrogation, Babban confessed to his crime and told the cops that he had planned to flee to Gujarat after the incident. “The knife used in the stabbing and blood stained clothes of the accused have been recovered,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Cops recovered the CCTV footage from one of the shops in the area. It showed the duo having an argument and Babban pushing Junaid after the argument turned violent. “While they were fighting, a huge crowd had gathered in the area, but none of them tried resolving the matter,” added the police officer.
