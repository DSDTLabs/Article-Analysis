Former Union minister M Veerappa Moily, president of the Congress Manifesto Drafting Committee, is confident of the party returning to power with an absolute majority. He says there is no anti-incumbency wave in the state. “The achievements of the Congress government led by Siddaramaiah will help the party retain power in the state. Neither Prime Minister   nor BJP president   can stop the Congress from marching towards victory,” Moily told TOI in an informal chat.

 Q 
 
 
 BJP has become desperate, we have not. First of all, secularism is one of the philosophies Kannadigas believe in, and the Congress practices. It still runs in the veins of Kannadigas as ‘Kannada Prajne’ -- Kannada consciousness. Earlier, BJP ruled just as an accident because of the JD(S).
 
 Q 
 
 Who protected the nation in the past 70 years? Did BJP or RSS protect the nation? They brought insecurity and disintegration to the nation. Their foundations in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat are shaking. That means there is a mandate against the BJP and its communal agenda.
 
 Q 
 
 
 Modi is not answering MPs in Parliament. He has no trust in Parliament. Niti Ayog remains a body without the power of thinking. In the Gujarat election, he camped there for over a month. Now he has lost confidence and is visiting only for 5-6 days here. He had campaigned in Karnataka in 2013 too. People of Karnataka have the sense to understand their lies.
 
 Q 
 
 
 We have been campaigning projecting our manifesto before the people. We have given a manifesto that benefits every individual in the state. It will definitely be a major discussion this election. We have implemented 99% of the promises made in 2013. All promises in the manifesto for 2018-23 will also be implemented successfully.
 
 Q 
 
 
 G Janardhana Reddy and B Sriramulu had created a nexus of corruption in Ballari, and Anand Singh was a scapegoat in it. Reddy was the captain, and according to BJP president Yeddyurappa, he is one of the three pillars of their party. However, their president Amit Shah has disowned him. Anand Singh was practically a Congressman and has returned to our party.
 
 Q 
 
 
 Five national institutes have submitted reports proving that the project will yield water required for parched regions. Those reports were approved by the National Green Tribunal too. The next government will complete the project as per schedule and follow all procedures.
 
 Q 
 
 
 First of all, he has not been denied a party ticket to contest from Karkala. H Gopal Bhandary, who had lost by a narrow margin of about 4,000 votes, was given the ticket. Oscar Fernandes and other leaders mooted the proposal to field Harsha in Karkala. We said, let us see. We had not requested the party for a ticket. But Bhandary belongs to a microscopic minority and denying a seat to such a person is not appropriate. Harsha is assisting me now and is a spokesperson of the Congress. It is the Congress, not me, which will decide his future. I don’t mix personal life and politics.
