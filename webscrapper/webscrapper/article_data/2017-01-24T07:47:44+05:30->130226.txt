VADODARA: In a rare instance, the   (VMC) presented a budget without any hikes in taxes. The trend so far has been that while the administration proposes hikes, the elected wing either tones them down or rejects them.

 The Rs 3,770 crore 2017-18 budget presented by VMC commissioner Dr   on Monday for the first time divides the city into three parts based on the character of each area –   that comprises of the Walled City areas, the Core City comprising of areas that have been included in area-based development projects under the   and the   that includes the growing areas. Development works have been proposed keeping in mind the characteristics of each of these areas. Rao said that the tax hikes could not have generated significant revenue. 
 
 “Instead, we will be raising revenue through initiatives like energy from solid waste and selling water to industries after tertiary treatment of sewage. Savings will also be made through initiatives like efficient street lighting and pumping stations,” said Rao. He added that he civic body was working on the cricket maxim that a run saved is a run scored. The development of the city will largely be fuelled by public-private partnership projects. Through such projects like housing schemes and others, the civic body is also looking to generate revenue.
 
 The budget highlights the fact that the civic body was looking a medium-term planning for the city with time-bound implementation of projects. The effort has been termed as Action 2020 Vadodara. 
 
 The standing committee of the civic body will now start deliberating on the budget and clear it with changes, if any. In a first, the budget dedicated separate sections to social infrastructure and welfare schemes s well as sustainability.
