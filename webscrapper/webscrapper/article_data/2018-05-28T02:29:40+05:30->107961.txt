MUMBAI:   may soon deploy see-through Vistadome coaches for second-class travellers of the Neral-Matheran   so that all tourists get a scenic experience. 

 At present, such a coach is available only for first-class travellers. 
 
 A railway board member (rolling stock), accompanied by Mumbai divisional railway manager (in-charge) and other senior railway officials inspected the section on Sunday. 
 
 A CR official said that they interacted with tourists on value-addition to railway services there. The official said that modifications to coaches will be done at CR’s workshop and the fare will be fixed in consultation with the railway board. 
 
 The plan will be finalised in few days so that the facility is available after the monsoon. CR also has plans to set aside a coach in the train for a restaurant to serve local Maharastrian dishes. 
 
 The toy train is on the tentative list of UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites.
