Seenuramasamy’s assistant Daya is making his debut as a director with  , which stars TV star   and newbie Riyamikka in the lead. Interestingly, it was his guru who recommended Prajin’s name, informs Daya. “This is a character that needs someone like Dhanush or Vijay Sethupathi, but they are already busy stars with a handful of films, and I could not wait for a year or so. That is when   sir suggested that I look at Prajin, who was impressive in Pazhaya Vannarapettai,” reveals the director.

 He says that he chose the Bangalore-based Riyamikka because she is a “Tamil-speaking girl”. 
 
 The film, he informs, is inspired from a real-life incident. “The story is set in Kundrathur and revolves around an aimless, happy-go-lucky youngster who gets into a problem and how when he tries to sort it out, it turns into a bigger problem. But it has been narrated in a humorous manner,” adds Daya.
 
 The supporting cast includes comedian  , who agreed to act without taking any salary because he was impressed with the role, director-turned-actor RNR Manohar, and actress Shakeela, for whom, the director says, the role will provide an image makeover.
