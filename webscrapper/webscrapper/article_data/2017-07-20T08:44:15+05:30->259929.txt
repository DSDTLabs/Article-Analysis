NAGPUR: Listening to inspiring stories cheers all, young and old. ‘Pure pur Nagpur’, a new series started by  , saw a fresh set of couples from different walks of life come and share their experiences. An interaction with the couples was held at Shri Ram Sabhagruha, Ram Nagar, on Wednesday evening.

 For this second session in its series, noted builder Prabhakar Mundle and wife Anuradha, and Prahar Military School’s founder Colonel (retired)   and wife Shama were invited for a chat. Theatre artiste   moderated the session. She posed questions to all four of them, touching upon areas such as challenges, memories, family and social lives.
 
 “You have been making one leap after another,” said Deuskar to Mundle. He said, “I once asked a businessman what was his secret to success.” He said, “You have to jump at the right opportunity at the right time. That is when I left my job and became a contractor.”
 
 “I once built four dams out of which one started leaking after heavy rains,” said Mundle. “Everyone thought that the dam would collapse. That day, I stood for hours in the rain and got the cracks repaired,” he said. Anuradha said that she prayed for his well-being and went to temple for 11 Tuesdays after that.
 
 Sunil said that he was 21 when he joined the Army. “I was thrilled by questioning what a war was. We used to be told that every soldier should see a war at least once in his life.” Nana Patekar’s movie Prahar inspired him to start a military school, he said.
 
 Didn’t wife Shama ever restrict him? “No, I loved social work as well,” she responded. Talking about their marital life, Shama said she never told her problems to the colonel in letters. “I used to be aware that he was on the border. And to let him focus on his work, I kept house issues away from him. I single-handedly nurtured the house and my children,” she said.
 
 The session saw the couples recall more memories and talk about their lives; their good and bad moments with the audience.
