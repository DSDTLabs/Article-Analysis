MUMBAI: For 15 days from Tuesday, civic teams will go from house to house in 70 areas looking for people who could be suffering from tuberculosis. 

 As the population of Mumbai, dubbed as the TB capital of the country, is out for work during the day, the BMC drive will be held between 4pm and 8pm only. BMC has created teams of 374 health officials for this drive. “We plan to cover 9 lakh population over the fortnight,” said city TB officer Dr Daksha Shah. Suspected patients will be given a voucher for a free X-ray test and   will return the next morning to collect  .
 
 “This is an extension of a national programme for active surveillance. While the drive was held in rest of the country between July 15 and 30, the Mumbai leg will be held between August 1 and 15,” said Dr Shah. Active surveillance, the term given for surveys that seek out patients instead of waiting for them to come to doctors, could help identify the “hidden patients”.
 
 India is home to one-fourth of the world's TB patients; it also has among the highest number of patients with drug-resistant TB. “The idea is to find patients earlier so that they don't spread the disease within the community,” said Dr Shah.
