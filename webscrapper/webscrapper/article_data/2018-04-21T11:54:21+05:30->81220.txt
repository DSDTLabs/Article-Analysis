VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh chief minister   on Friday took on the BJP-led   government and Prime Minister   in his address to the gathering after breaking his 12-hour fast. 

 "Without attributing any reason, the NDA government took back the 350 crore it gave to the state for the development of its backward areas. Now, the BJP-led NDA government has made it clear that it does not care for Andhra Pradesh or the problems facing it. They are indulging in back door politics by conspiring with the opposition parties here. Some people are fearing that the cases filed against them will be pursued and therefore, are toeing the   line. And since they know I will not bend easily, the BJP is conspiring against me with help of the parties," he said. 
 
 Naidu also alleged that the Centre arm-twisted the Tamil Nadu government. "They cannot do that with me. I am not afraid of any cases being slapped against me. The people of the state are my high command," he said. 
 
 Having charged   chief Jaganmohan Reddy(without naming him) with colluding with the BJP, Naidu picked on Jana Sena leader and actor Pawan Kalyan. Referring to the tweets by Pawan criticising the CM and his son Lokesh, Naidu said the TDP will never indulge in character assassination of anyone. "We don't have such a history. This is the credibility we built over a period of time. If someone has a personal problem, they should deal it in their own way," he said.
