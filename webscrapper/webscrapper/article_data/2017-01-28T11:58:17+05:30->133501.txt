GUWAHATI: Former Union finance and home minister   on Friday said demonetisation will not be the sole factor that will determine the outcome of the upcoming elections in five states. 

 Delivering a lecture on demonetisation during the launch of the   here, Chidambaram said, "Each state has its own set of problems. The economic blockade in Manipur is not there in Punjab. Also, it is not a straight fight between demonetisation and anti-demonetisation. So, it is difficult to say that currency ban will have an impact on the assembly polls." 
 
 However, the former minister said demonetisation has disrupted the 'economic' rhythm of the country and its impact will continue for at least two years.
 
 Terming   a 'hoax', Chidambaram added that the Prime Minister should ensure that no one asks for bribe and educational institutions do not seek capitation fee as money has been demonetised. 
 
 "Currency ban will neither kill black money nor corruption. Unless we strike at the root of the problem, demonetisation will not help. Suddenly, the narrative on   has changed to cashless economy. It is completely nonsensical to go cashless. Even countries like Germany, Austria and the US are doing transactions in cash despite being digitized," he said. 
 
 "The economy is crippled. Small and medium industries have closed and jobs have been lost. Demonetisation was completely unnecessary. No natural disaster would have caused the misery which people are facing now," he added.
