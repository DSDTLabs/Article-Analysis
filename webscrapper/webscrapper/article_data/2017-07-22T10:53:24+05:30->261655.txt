MUMBAI: Cricket Down Under is under a cloud of uncertainty. 

 The on-going pay dispute between Cricket   and its players seems to getting worse by the day. The impasse resulted in the Australian cricketers boycotting an 'A' tour to South Africa recently, and, unless things improve quickly, Australia's forthcoming tours to Bangladesh and India too look to be in danger.
 
 With the deadline for concerned parties to strike a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) having passed on June 30, around 230 Australian cricketers have been left unemployed. It has forced the Australian Cricketers' Association ( ) to send its Commercial Manager,  , to explore "commercial opportunities" for the 'on-strike' players in India.
 
 Elaborating about the purpose of his visit, the former   batsman told TOI on Friday: "The main reason for my trip is to have a few meetings, because as of July 1, when the players came off contract, the majority of the Australian cricketers have signed their intellectual property over to the ACA, and that's been managed by the cricketer's brand wing of ACA. So, that creates obviously a number of commercial opportunities for the ACA and for the players. And obviously, they're currently unemployed. So, we're going to have a look at the additional revenue streams that can come to the ACA and the players.
 
 "So, we're having a number of meetings with local companies and very influential people in the marketing world to just getting the ball rolling on a few of those commercial partnerships."
 
 But wouldn't the cricketers' brand value go down if they don't play international cricket? "Look, to think that the players won't play international cricket is probably pretty farfetched. They will play international cricket again. It's just a matter of when. I don't think their value will go down at all. I think it will actually create the opposite impact on the Australian market. The companies want to support the players."
