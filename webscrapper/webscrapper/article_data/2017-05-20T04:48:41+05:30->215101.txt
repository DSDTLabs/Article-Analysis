A research scientist at the Junagadh Agriculture University, K Varu, said that around 20% of the mango crop has already been harvested and it is going on in full swing. He said that the quality of mango is likely to suffer because of the unseasonal rains and that may dampen market sentiments. Varu further said that the produce may also go down. 

 There is likelihood of drop in demand following rains. The JAU scientist said that in the coming days, the supply of mango will go up in the market but with the drop in demand, there is possibility of dip in prices.
 
 Officials at the Talala yard, the biggest market yard for mango trading in the state, have not witnessed any drop in supply. Worried over the rains, the officials carried out a survey and found that Junagadh, the main mango supply zone for Talala, had not witnessed any rain. "The mango input was 18,000 boxes of 10kg each and the price ranged from Rs 400 to Rs 500 for the best quality mango. For other qualities, it is ranged between Rs 300 and Rs 400 for a box of 10kg," said Ramesh Tant, the in-charge secretary at the market yard.
