HYDERABAD: The CAG audit report has exposed that   is not a ‘revenue surplus’ state but a ‘revenue deficit’ state,   president   said. He said the party would take the revelations on corruption to the people in the coming months.

 Addressing a press conference on Friday, the   president said the CAG report categorically said the state government showed borrowings as the state’s revenue. “This reflects incompetence of TRS government in managing finances and also corruption in various departments,” Laxman said.
 
 He said when the opposition parties have raised the issue and said that the state is getting into a debt trap with over ?1lakh crore borrowings, CM K   attacked opposition party leaders and even said that the Centre and BJP-ruled states also borrowed money and even declared that none of the states can survive without borrowings.
 
 “We are not against borrowings, but the government should be cautious on its borrowings and revenues and it has to create assets for the state. But this government has failed and created a hype that Telangana is a rich state,” the BJP president said.
 
 Laxman said the state government has become a sample government. “Of the promised two lakh houses, only 570 were constructed and given to beneficiaries in four years. Similarly, three acres land distribution to Dalits too become a sample scheme,” he said. He said welfare schemes have taken a back seat. The government publicised some schemes more than implementation. Laxman alleged works were taken up to benefit contractors and secure commissions for people.
