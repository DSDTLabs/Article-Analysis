VIJAYAWADA: Homoeopathy is not a pseudoscience, according to  , Union Minister of   (independent charge) in the ministry of ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, Siddha and homoeopathy (AYUSH).

 “The conclusion of the most comprehensive systematic reviews of studies based on classical homoeopathy have concluded that it has a positive and specific effect greater than placebo alone. Four systematic review/meta-analyses of   for all conditions have been published in international peer reviewed journals. Of these, hundreds of clinical trials reached a positive conclusion that there is evidence that homeopathy is clinically effective. Review of basic research on highly diluted homeopathic medicines found 98 replicated experiments, over 70% of replications were positive,” Naik said in the   Tuesday, in response to an unstarred question from V. Vijayasai Reddy, a YSRCP member.
 
 “Homeopathy is being promoted as it is not only safe and effective but also due to its high acceptance through high quality surveys of use of homeopathy. In India, at 23 Institutes/Unit under   in Homeopathy (CCRH), there is 50 per cent more footfall of patients seeking homoeopathic treatment during the last five years,” Naik said.
