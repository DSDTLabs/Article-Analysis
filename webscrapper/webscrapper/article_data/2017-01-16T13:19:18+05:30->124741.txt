RANCHI: In Jharkhand, a woman is not safe even inside her home. Data released by the   (NCRB) shows that 1,654 cases of cruelty by husband or his relatives were reported by women of the state in 2015. 

 However, the figures include only those cases in which FIRs have been lodged against the accused. Several cases reach the   but are sorted through mediation and counselling.
 
 Officer in-charge of Ranchi Women's PS, Deepika Kumari said, "We get around 120 to 150 cases here every month. Most of it is either related to domestic violence or live-in-relationships."
 
 Every district in the state has at least one women PS, set up to resolve family disputes. In case of a domestic dispute, both parties are summoned to the police station for counselling and it is after several sessions of counselling that most of the cases are solved. 
 
 "The main function of a women's police station is to try and solve issues through counselling since most of the cases are family-related.   when counselling is ineffective," Kumari said. 
 
 She added, "The women's police station has been set up with the aim to reduce breaking of families. If these cases go to regular PS then a case would directly be lodged and there is no scope of reuniting the family."
 
 Apart from domestic abuse, cases related to live-in-relationships are also high in the state. In such cases, the woman often accuses the man of entering a physical relationship on the pretext.
