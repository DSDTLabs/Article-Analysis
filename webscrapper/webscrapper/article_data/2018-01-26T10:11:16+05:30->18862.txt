KOLHAPUR: Lawyers from   district protested against the state government's decision to raise court fees by staying away from court proceedings on Thursday.

 The initiative taken by lawyers’ organisation, Kolhapur District   ( ), has stated they will soon coordinate with other organisations from across the state and will stay away from court proceedings one day at a time throughout the state.
 
 “The state government has almost doubled the court fees in almost all the cases and it is a severe blow to litigants, especially the poor. Litigants have already started complaining about rise in court fees and have asked us to raise our voice against it. The litigants have also agreed to participate in our protest,” said  , president of KDBA.
 
 “A meeting of KDBA members and lawyers was conducted at the bar council in city on Tuesday where everyone expressed their views stating that the sudden rise in court fees goes against the right of every citizen to get justice enshrined in the Indian Constitution. The lawyers also expressed their reservations as the state government did not consult the lawyers before hiking court fees. It was decided to organise a rally at district collectorate on Thursday and stay away from the court proceedings,” he said.
 
 “On Thursday morning, all lawyers gathered outside the district court premises located at Kasaba Bawada area of city and after burning the government resolution (GR) of hike in the court fees, we reached the district collectorate. A bike rally was organised and slogans were shouted against the government,” he said.
 
 “We handed over the letter, protesting against the government’s decision to district collector   and asked him to convey our feelings to the higher authorities. Subhedar accepted our letter and stated that he will convey our message and feelings to the state government as early as possible,” he said.
