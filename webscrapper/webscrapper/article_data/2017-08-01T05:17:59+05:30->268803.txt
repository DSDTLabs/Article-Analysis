 One of the accused, Ravin, had died in jail on October 4 last year after contracting viral fever, which jail authorities had termed a suspected case of dengue. He was taken to the LNJP Hospital from the Luksar jail.
 
 On the night of September 28, 2015, a mob attacked Mohammad Akhlaq and his son Danish at Bisada village in Dadri over suspicion of slaughtering a cow and storing beef in his house. Akhlaq had succumbed to his injuries on the spot while Danish survived.
 
 Eighteen local youths, including three juveniles, were charged with murder and assault in the case. The juveniles were granted bail in 2015 while the adults were granted bail by the high court subsequently. Rupendra and Shriom have sought bail while Vivek is yet to file a bail plea in the court.
