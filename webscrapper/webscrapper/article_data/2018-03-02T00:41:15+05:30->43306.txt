NEW DELHI: Most women bureaucrats posted with the Delhi government have been perturbed since deputy   Manish   had compared the   boycotting a DoE seminar with daughters-in-law working under the pressure of patriarchal mothers-in-law. Sisodia, however, chose to skirt the issue on Thursday after a press conference. 

 TOI had reported that when the principal secretary and the director of education did not turn up for a national seminar on improving education on Tuesday, the education minister took potshots at them. 
 
 On Wednesday, Joint Forum of Delhi Government Employees said in a resolution that “the statement given by the deputy CM at the national seminar in connection with the principal secretary and the director of education is highly regressive and condemnable. Such loose comments regarding the bureaucracy and the current situation are extremely gender insensitive and reprehensible, especially when coming from the minister of women and child development, a constitutional authority.” 
 
 The statement was read out by IAS officer Nidhi Srivastava, the district magistrate of New Delhi and a director in  . She shared space with director (women and child development) Shilpa Shinde and Sakshi Mittal, director (agriculture and marketing). “The statement reflects the sentiments of senior women officers, too, who have felt offended,” a top bureaucrat said on Thursday.
 
 Comparing certain officers’ unions with the patriarchal mothers-in-law who keep their daughters-in-law from coming before their fathers-in-law, Sisodia had said a certain section of the bureaucracy was keeping officers away from reporting to work. 
 
 “There is a fear of the mother-in-law in orthodox traditions... Our department has a similar situation these days. Some unions have put themselves in place of the mother-in-law and warned them against turning up in front of the minister,” Sisodia had said in Hindi.
