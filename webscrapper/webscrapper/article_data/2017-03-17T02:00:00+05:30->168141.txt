PATNA: The Patna police may not be able to take Bihar Staff Selection Commission (BSSC)’s suspended chairman   on further police remand for interrogation.

 The 1987-batch IAS official filed a petition before a special vigilance court on Thursday, citing a Supreme Court order of 1992 in Anupam J Kulkarni case. The SC order allowed only judicial custody of accused after 15 days of arrest.
 
 The bureaucrat was arrested on February 24 for his alleged involvement in a job scam, which involved leakage of questions of examinations to recruit 13,120 clerks in state government departments.
 
 Special vigilance public prosecutor Anandi Singh told this newspaper that Kumar’s petition would be heard by the court only if police move the court to seek further police remand of the officer. 
 
 A senior advocate said had the officer not filed the petition, police could have taken him on remand as they did in case of the other accused of the job scam. 
 
 Meanwhile, all the arrested accused, including Kumar, appeared before the court on Thursday. Singh said the next hearing would take place on March 30.
