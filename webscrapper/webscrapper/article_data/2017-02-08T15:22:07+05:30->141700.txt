Actor David   says he wants that more female directors should be given opportunities to helm movies. 

 "I'd love to see a lot more movie stars demanding that female directors be considered for their movies...," Oyelowo said. 
 
  
  
 While answering about the challenge to bring audience to the theatres, Oyelowo said it is really difficult because TV nowadays is doing exceptionally well. 
 
 "The biggest challenge (of working in movies in 2017) is getting people to actually leave their homes to go and watch a film in a movie theatre. There's so much great television these days, it means your film has to be exceptional to persuade people to leave the house," he said.
