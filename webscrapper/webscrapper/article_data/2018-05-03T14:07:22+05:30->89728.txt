Vadodara: The indefinite hunger strike by three senior citizens in Karamsad ended with state   president Jitu   rushing to the town in Anand district and urging them to do so. The elderly men were holding the protest since Monday to demand a special status for the town as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had a close association with it.

 Vaghani had reached Karamsad late in the afternoon and met the protestors along with Anand MP Dilip Patel. Vaghani assured the protestors that the government would take up the matter and do the needful.
 
 The assurance, however, has not convinced all. Sources said that some persons wanted the state BJP chief to give them details of the plan for the town.
 
 Rashesh Patel who had worked actively during the three-day agitation said that they would now keep a close tab on what the government would do for Karamsad. “Right now, it is just an assurance and nothing more,” he said.
 
 Sources said that the sense of urgency shown by the ruling BJP in ensuring that the agitation ends may have its roots in the fact that influential spiritual leaders were expressing solidarity with the cause. Also, the local members of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti headed by   Patel had supported the agitation. Word had also spread that Hardik may visit the fasting elders too.
 
 On Wednesday itself, former Vishwa Hindu Parishad international president Dr   had also written a post on his   wall supporting the agitation. He also questioned the delay in declaring Karamsad as national heritage.
 
 It also seems that the BJP as well as the administration was in a hurry to ensure that the agitation ended. As soon as the thee elders broke their fast, the process of removing the tent was started and within no time the venue was cleared.
