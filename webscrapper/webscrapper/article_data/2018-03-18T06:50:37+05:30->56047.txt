KOCHI: Mattancherry   have got a new building to house their police station. Local self-government minister   on Saturday inaugurated the new building. 

 The minister said that road accident cases in the state are going up. "Many lives can be saved if we have some patience. For the state to become culturally rich then the crime rate should go down.
