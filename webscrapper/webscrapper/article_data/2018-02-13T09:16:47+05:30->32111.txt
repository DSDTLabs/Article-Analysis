MUMBAI: The   ( ) has asked the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to allot two playoffs in the forthcoming edition of the   to Pune, on the grounds that the now defunct Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS), which reached the IPL 10 final, was based out of Pune.

 
 In a letter (a copy of which is with TOI) to IPL chairman Rajiv Shukla, which has also been marked to the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA), CEO Rahul Johri, IPL COO Hemang Amin, and the office-bearers on Monday, MCA president Abhay Apte has claimed that “For the past several years, we’re observing a practice, which has become an unwritten rule of playing the first, and qualifier one as well as the final (of the IPL) at the venue of last year’s champions and playing the eliminator and qualifier 2 matches at the venue of the runners-up team. RPS were last IPL’s runners-up and their home venue was Pune.
 
 “As such, Pune’s MCA Stadium in Gahunje (which was RPS’ home venue) should be the logical choice to stage the eliminator and qualifier 2 matches. Just because there’s no ‘Pune team’ this year, we can’t change history and record that this was the venue of the runners-up team of IPL10. Holding matches at Pune will also be an honour and do justice to the fan base of the IPL which has been created at Pune.”
 
 The letter further adds: “Last year, the same venue had staged three international matches and eight IPL games. The stadium is fit and ready to host the IPL as well as international matches at any point in time.”
 
 
 
 Meanwhile, the IPL GC is likely to take a final decision regarding the timing of the IPL-11 matches in its meeting. There was a proposal from the telecasters’ (Star Sports) to reschedule the timing of the matches on the weekend to 5.30pm and 7pm, but according to sources, the league is likely to stick to the present timings of 4 and 8 pm.
