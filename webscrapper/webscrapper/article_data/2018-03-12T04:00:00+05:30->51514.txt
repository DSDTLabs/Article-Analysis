Vadodara: A branch manager of a private finance bank was booked at Karjan police station on Sunday for not depositing over Rs four lakh loan collection with the bank.

 The accused Nikulsinh Chauhan, a native of Mehmdabad in Kheda, worked as manager of Fincare Small Finance Bank Limitedâ€™s Karjan branch. Police said that Chauhan was responsible for clearing the loan application of the applicants and collect installments of loan from them.
 
 However, according to the complaint given by regional manager of the bank Rajeshkumar Chauhan, Chauhan did not deposit the instalment collected between November 2016 and April 2017 with the bank. When the bank recently contacted the customers to repay their loan amount, they informed them that they had already paid the amount to Chauhan but he did not gave them a receipt for it.
 
 While the bank officials were probing the scam, Chauhan left the job without informing the bank authorities which raised the suspicion against him, police said. After the bank finished its investigation, it came to light that Chauhan had taken instalments from 73 customers which amounted to over Rs four lakh. The bank then contacted Chauhan about siphoning off money after which he promised to repay the amount.
 
 But when he failed to repay, the bank then approached the police.
