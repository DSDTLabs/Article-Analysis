RAMKOT (AMRITSAR):   (BSF) arrested a   and shot his accomplice during a midnight operation at the international border with Pakistan near the Ramkot border outpost (BOP).   also seized 4kgof heroin during a search of the area.

 It for the first time in the past one decade that a   has been arrested n Amritsar sector, said BSF officials. In previous anti-smuggling operations, the Pakistani smugglers were either shot dead or they managed to flee back in the cover of darkeness, leaving behind narcotics, arms and ammunition consignments.
 
 BSF deputy inspector general (DIG), Amritsar sector, J S Oberoi said two smugglers of Thathha Dhilwan village of Pakistan, which is opposite the Ramkot BOP, had made a smuggling bid on Thursday midnight. One of the smugglers, Shabbir Hussain (30), was arrested while his accomplice Rashid was shot.
 
 A BSF patrolling party spotted some suspicious movement along the international border and challenged the intruders. The intruders ignored the warning and continued to move towards border fence inside the Indian territory following which BSF troops opened fire and shot Rashid and overpowered Shabbir.
 
 “It’s very risky to arrest intruders or smugglers beyond the border fence. They might have lethal weapons as in one of the cases, Pakistani smugglers had AK-47 rifles,” said DIG Oberoi. He said that the preliminary questioning of Shabbir had revealed that he worked as a courier for some groups. “He claimed to have crossed the border for the first time, but then he kept on changing his statements,” the officer added.
 
 Shabbir has been handed over to police. “We believe his interrogation will unmask several faces both in India and Pakistan,” said sources. Pakistan-based smugglers often recruit boys living in border villages since they are not only familiar with the border topography but are also willing to risk their lives for even small amount of money.
