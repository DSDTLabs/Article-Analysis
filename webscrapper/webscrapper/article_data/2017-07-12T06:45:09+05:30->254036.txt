CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister   has sought Centre’s support to launch a ‘Connect with your roots’ (CYR) programme for the Punjabi-origin youth settled abroad.

 The chief minister discussed the proposed programme with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a meeting on Tuesday. Amarinder said that the programme would provide an opportunity to the youngsters, settled in different parts of the world, to visit places from where their families hailed or where they themselves spent their early years.
 
 The proposed scheme could be open to those in the 16-22 age group, he suggested, adding that the programme would provide the youngsters a platform to go back to their roots and connect with the same. It would also enable them to learn about their family background and the culture to which they belong, Amarinder said, adding that there was curiosity among the Indian-origin youngsters settled in other countries to know about their ancestral home.
 
 The Punjab government has already launched a ‘Friends of Punjab’ scheme for NRIs of Punjabi-origin to participate in the development and growth of the state. The new programme will enhance the NRI engagement at the level of the youth, who can be a vital engine in the state’s programme, the chief minister said.
