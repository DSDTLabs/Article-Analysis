Monsoon and masti was the theme of the party recently organised by Bharat Vikas Parishad, Kashi. The d√©cor had the feel of monsoon, as decorated umbrellas were used as props. 
Since colours blue and green were the dress code for the evening, we spotted most of the members adhering to it. 
 Several performances by the members further spiced up the evening. Anuj Didwania rendered the song Baharo Phool Barsao. Next to follow was another retro number   crooned by Pankaj Agarwal. Husband and wife duo Dr Ashwini and Dr   danced to Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. Bharat and   were well-applauded as they rendered and danced to Hum Ko Humhee Se Chura Lo.
