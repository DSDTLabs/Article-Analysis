GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat Congress has accused the   and   of “misleading” the people and taking “undue credit for the Narmada dam project.”

 Speaking at a press conference organized in Ahmedabad by the party, Gujarat Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki said that the BJP is boasting about the Narmada dam today.
 
 “But it was the great Congress leader, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who thought of the Sardar Sarovar in 1946 to end water scarcity in Gujarat and usher in the green revolution,” he said.
 
 “By 2002, work on raising dam to 88 meter height had been completed. But after Modi became the CM, he could add only 33 metres to the height in 15 years. Today, only 20% of the people get water for irrigation and drinking against the original plan,” Solanki said.
 
 The Gujarat Congress chief further alleged that the BJP had diverted water to industries instead of giving it to farmers.
 
 Meanwhile, Gujarat revenue minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama accused the Congress of making false allegations on the Narmada dam project. “Congress-led UPA government halted project clearances for years. These clearances were given by Modi as soon as he became the PM,” Chudasama said.
