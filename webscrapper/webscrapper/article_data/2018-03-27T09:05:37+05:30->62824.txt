PUNE: India’s   tie against China moved from the tricky to the challenging on Monday after  , the player of the moment, pulled out with a combination of abdominal and shoulder problems.

 
 “Yuki conveyed to us that he has minor abdominal tissue tear and impingement in the shoulder,” SP Misra, the chairman of selectors, told TOI. “It’s a blow. The way he has been playing, we thought two singles points were assured and we had to look for just one more point,” he added, referring to Bhambri’s run in recent weeks when he qualified for the ATP Masters series tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami in the US.
 
 Bhambri’s scalps in Indian Wells included seasoned veteran Nicolas Mahut of France and World No. 12 Lucas Pouille before he fell to   in three sets. In Miami, the 25-year-old Delhi lad beat World No. 75 Mirza Basic of Bosnia before falling to No. 11 Jack Sock of the US.
 
 The in-form Bhambri is expected to be out of action for at least 15 days. While the true extent of the injury is yet to be ascertained, shoulder impingement (of the tendons by shoulder bone caused by repetitive overhead motion) might need a minimum of three-four weeks rest and therapy to treat it, depending on the seriousness.
 
 It will be a huge dampener for Bhambri himself as, after repeatedly being hampered by a variety of injuries - especially the tennis elbow that put him out of action for eight months in 2016, he finally seemed to reap the benefits of a world class fitness regimen when he has been laid low again.
 
 The selectors have named Prajnesh Gunneswaran, the next highest-ranked Indian on the ATP Tour after   and Sumit Nagal, who are already among the five nominated players. Rohan Bopanna and Leander Paes are the other two while Divij Sharan is the reserve in the squad for the   1 second round tie to be played in Tianjin on April 6-7.
