The development is crucial as eligible oustees of the project will be allotted alternative plots in this sector though fresh lucky draws, slated for February 7. The oustees have also been demanding completion of development works in the sector before plot allottment.

 Out of the 18km-long Northern Peripheral Road ( ) or Dwarka expressway, work is completed on 14.5km stretch. Work is held up in the remaining stretch as around 464 houses in New Palam Vihar, Tekchand Nagar, Kherki Daula and Mohammadpur are falling in the way and their residents have not yet been rehabilitated.
 
 “The development of Sector 110A was delayed due to litigation related to acquisition of land. But now we have resolved all the legal issues. Development works will be completed soon. We are hoping to rehabilitate oustees of the project soon after issuing allotment letters for alternative plots following the fresh draw of lots,” a senior Huda official told TOI on Monday.
 
 As per the development plan, Sector 110-A will have around 478 plots on 14.60 acres of land and 17.89-acre area has been reserved for open space and roads. Around 1.36 acres will be reserved for shopping complex, 0.65 acre for nursery schools, 0.20 acre for religious activity and 0.26 acre for nursery home. “The layout plan of the sector was revised to accommodate all oustees, including those who have small-sized plots,” said another official. 
 
 The expressway project was sanctioned in 2007 and was expected to be ready before the 2010 Commonweath Games, but in 2008 a number of writ petitions were filed by New Palam Vihar residents, challenging the acquisition of land for the same. On the directions of the Punjab and Haryana high court, Huda had agreed to allot alternative plots to residents whose houses were coming in the way of the proposed road.
