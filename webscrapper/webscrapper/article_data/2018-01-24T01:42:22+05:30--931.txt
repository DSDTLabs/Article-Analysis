NEW DELHI: AAP on Tuesday said O P Rawat, who would succeed AK Joti as  , “has accepted that the   did not give a hearing to the 20 MLAs”. 

 The party continued its attack on Election Commission over the disqualification of its 20 MLAs in the office of profit case. The disqualification was also branded as a “Tughlaqi farman”. 
 
 AAP spokesperson   said EC had told the party that all the MLAs would be given a hearing. He claimed EC was   like a “khap panchayat” and giving a verdict without hearing the other side. 
 
 The party also questioned the role of Rawat in the disqualification proceedings. “Rawat had recused himself from the hearing because he was close to several BJP functionaries, including Shivraj Singh Chouhan. But he again joined the case six months ago. This information was not shared with AAP or the MLAs concerned,” Chadha said.
 
 Sanjay Singh, the party’s MP-elect for Rajya Sabha, said, “The AAP government is making progress in education and health, but BJP is trying to scuttle the work by misusing constitutional bodies and disrespecting the mandate of the people.”
 
 EC had recommended disqualification of the MLAs on Friday, and the President had approved it on Sunday.
