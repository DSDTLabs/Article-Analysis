NEW DELHI: There was drama to add to the mystery behind the disappearance of   on Saturday when police turned up at his house at Badaun in UP to investigate who had accessed the missing JNU student’s email account. 

 It turned out that Ahmed’s uncle,  , had logged in, though the Crime Branch team isn’t sure how he got the account password. A probe is being conducted but the cops have not shared any details.
 
 “Our technical analysis showed Najeeb’s email had been accessed by somebody, and we swiftly sent a team to Badaun,” said a police officer. The cops also denied that the visit was a “raid”, as alleged by some relative of Ahmed. 
 
 Ahmed had gone missing on October 15 from his hostel room after a scuffle with ABVP members. The alacrity with which the cops responded to the email access perhaps indicates they are keenly keeping tabs on anything related to the missing youth. “Search operations are continuing in all possible places, including homes of friends and relatives,” said  , joint commissioner (Crime). “Today morning, the DCP himself led the team, and the search proceedings were videographed.”
 
 The Crime Branch has already arrested two people for making a call to Ahmed’s family demanding Rs 20 lakh as ransom. A youth who studied with Ahmed at   from 2008 to 2010 and some friends in   have also been questioned. A police team has been stationed in his native town Farukkhabad.
