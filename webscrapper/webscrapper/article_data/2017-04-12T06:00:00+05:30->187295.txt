Visakhapatnam: The Kuchipudi Kalakshetra founded by legendary classical dancer and Padma Bhushan awardee Vempati Chinna Satyam is all set to get a facelift.

 Speaking to TOI, the academy’s secretary and Chinna Satyam’s son Vempati Venkat said they do not want any government body to undertake the renovation and will generate their own funds through donations by former students. “We feel that the government will commercialise the academy. Nearly Rs 5 crore is required to develop the institute as a Gurukulam. A hostel will also be built,” Venkat said.
 
 Venkat further said the academy was kept undeveloped due to a court case filed by the forest department. However, it got a favourable verdict recently and the renovation works will begin soon. 
 
 The academy was built in 1983 on a three-acre land near Indira Gandhi Zoological Park. Chinna Satyam personally conducted classes which produced many renowned classical dancers since its inception.
 
 However, in the past one decade, the academy has lost its glory due to many reasons including the court case where the forest department claimed that the land belonged to them. Besides, Visakha Valley School tried to take possession of the site by claiming that the academy did not conduct any dance classes. However, a former district collector intervened and solved the issue in favour of the academy. 
 
 A classical dance teacher of the academy, Y Hanumantha Rao said they teach nearly 40 students in the existing premises. “We are also planning to tie up with Visakha Valley School to conduct classical dance classes for the students. This apart, the number of students will increase if the GVMC and Vuda authorities improve the infrastructure near the academy by developing roads and street lights,” he added.
 
 Some of the formers students and dance aspirants opined that the management should speed up the renovation works and make it an iconic classical dance academy of the north coastal region.
