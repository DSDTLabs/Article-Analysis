SHIMLA: Chief minister   on Tuesday said that he would be appearing before the ED in Delhi on April 13 in the   laundering case. He said earlier too he had appeared before the CBI whenever summoned in this regard. On the other hand, two cabinet ministers warned the BJP that if any effort was made for illegal action against Virbhadra, they would have to face serious consequences. 

 Interacting with mediapersons here, when asked about his appearance before the ED, Virbhadra maintained that he would. On Wednesday morning, he would leave for Delhi and return on Friday.
 
 In November 2015, the ED had registered a case against the chief minister under the provisions of the Prevention of   Act (PMLA) after taking cognizance of a criminal complaint filed by the CBI in this regard in September 2015.
 
 In a statement, irrigation and public health minister Vidya Stokes and industries minister   alleged that the BJP government at the Centre was misusing the central investigating agencies against its political opponents, which was not a healthy practice. They said that the investigation by three agencies in a single case against Virbhadra indicates the nefarious designs of the BJP. However, despite all odds, the state government had ensured unprecedented development in the state and it would again form the government, they claimed.
 
 They said that the Congress was not afraid of the BJP conspiracies against Virbhadra and the entire party and MLAs were rallying behind him. They said that the BJP had been trying to destabilise the democratically elected government in the state and the people of the state would never tolerate this. Stokes and Agnihotri said that assembly elections were due in the state this year and keeping this in mind, BJP leaders were involved in malicious propaganda against the chief minister to mislead the people and take political mileage.
