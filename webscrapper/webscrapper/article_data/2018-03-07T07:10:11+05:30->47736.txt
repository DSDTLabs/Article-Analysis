BENGALURU: The counter-complaint against Vidvat L, who was assaulted allegedly by  , son of   MLA N A  , and six others, has not seen any progress,   sources said. 

 The counter-complaint by Arun Babu, who is among the seven arrested in the assault case, alleged that Vidvat had attacked Haris, fell during the scuffle and sustained injuries on the face.
 
 According to sources, they need to take statements from the complainant, Vidvat and others, including Haris, before taking the case forward.
 
 While Vidvat’s friend   filed the complaint against Haris and associates around 11.30pm on February 17, Arun Babu filed his complaint at 5.30am. 
 
 “If there are allegations against Vidvat, they have to be proved during investigation. If the complainant’s statements and claims are false, we’ll have to seek the court’s permission to file a B report,” a police officer said.
 
 Asked whether police could initiate legal action against Arun if he’d lied in his complaint, an officer said: “It is left to senior officials. Vidvat, too, had the liberty to file another complaint, saying Arun had tried to hamper investigation by filing a false complaint.”
 
 Vidvat was brutally attacked, allegedly by Md Haris and his friends, inside a cafe in   on the night of February 17. When Vidvat was shifted to Mallya Hospital, Haris and his men allegedly chased him and threatened his brother Satwik L with dire consequences if they approached police.
