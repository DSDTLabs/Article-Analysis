NEW DELHI: Calling the Supreme Court’s rejection of its plea for an independent probe in the   death case as “grave error”, the Bombay Lawyers’ Association has filed a fresh petition in the apex court seeking recall of its ruling. 

 The court had on April 19 ruled out any foul play in the death of special judge B H Loya and dismissed a batch of petitions seeking probe. Relying on the discreet inquiry conducted by the commissioner of state intelligence, the court had said there is no ground for the court to hold that there was reasonable suspicion about the cause or circumstances behind the death which would merit a further inquiry. 
 
 A month after the court passed the verdict, the association filed a review petition and contended that the   wrongly relied on the findings of inquiry of the state intelligence chief whose report appeared to be “sham and a clear attempt to obstruct justice”. “The hurried inquiry by a police officer, howsoever high in ranking, is clearly insufficient in the facts of the case. 
 
 This court, with respect, has committed error apparent on the face of the record and without sufficient reason discarded the ‘Caravan’ articles overlooking the fact that the initiation of inquiry raised serious doubts about its independence and integrity,” the review petition said.
