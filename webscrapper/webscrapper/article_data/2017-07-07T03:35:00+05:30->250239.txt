Panaji: Discharge of sewage from a structure functioning now as a dormitory into the fields at Kumbharvaddo, Merces is causing nuisance and raising apprehensions of a health hazard in the area. A site inspection was held at the spot by Dr Kedar Raikar from the primary health centre, Corlim along with panchayat authorities and members of Merces manch welfare association.  The association members had complained about the nuisance caused by the illegal sewage flow and possibility of dengue and other diseases spreading in the area. The members requested the health officials in the presence of the panchayat secretary to initiate action to prevent further release of sewage.  Villagers visited a spot at Merces, where land-filling is being carried out illegally. Former sarpanch of Merces, Jyoti Pallienkar said that the current issues plaguing the village should be raised at the next gram sabha and villagers should unitedly work for planned development. Noting the extensive reclamation along the Old Goa-Panaji fourlane road, Sudesh Kalangutkar alleged that the panchayat body is only interested in issuing construction licences to mega projects without considering the village’s carrying capacity, narrow roads and inadequate power and water supply.  José Carmino Joao said the panchayat should protect the pristine features of greenery, agricultural land, medicinal spring and old drainage system. Taking stock of illegal land filling, locals voiced apprehensions about flooding of low-lying areas in extreme weather.
