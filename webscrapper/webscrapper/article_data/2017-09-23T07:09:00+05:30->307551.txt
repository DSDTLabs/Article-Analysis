GREATER NOIDA: After Noida and Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authorities revised their land allotment policy in June this year, Greater   (GNIDA)has also changed its norms for allotting land in its area for group   plots. 

 The proposal was approved in GNIDA’s 109th board meeting held on Friday. 
 
 From now, allottees of new group housing land will have to pay 10% of the land cost at time of registration of property and another 20% after allotment of land. The remaining 70% will be collected in 14 instalments in seven years. Currently, developers have to pay a mere 5% at the time of registration of property and 5% after allotment, while the balance amount is collected in 12 years, including a 2-year moratorium.
 
 According to experts, the land allotment policy, which was revised by the Mayawati-led BSP government in 2009, is the cause of the builder-homebuyer impasse at present. Before the revision, those allotted land in Noida, Greater Noida and YEIDA areas had to deposit 30% of the land cost with the authorities. However, after 2009, builders allotted land had to pay only 10%, and were even offered a two-year moratorium, during which they did not pay anything.
 
 “Our decision has been taken in order to help buyers,” said Debashish Panda, CEO, GNIDA. “This will ensure that only serious builders come forward to develop group societies,” he added.
 
 Another decision taken by the   government in 2009 was revoked by the GNIDA board on Friday. “In 2009, due to economic slowdown, one-time lease rent on commercial property was reduced from 27.5% to 11%, and yearly rent from 2% to 1%. We have restored it to the original format,” Panda said.
