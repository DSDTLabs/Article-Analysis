 NEW DELHI: A   today set July 17 as the next date to hear actor  's application challenging the trial court order sentencing him to a five-year jail term in the 1998  .
 
 
 
 Khan arrived in Jodhpur yesterday for the hearing of his application. The application was listed for hearing today before Jodhpur District and Sessions Judge Chandra Kumar Songara, the actor's counsel Nishant Bora said.
 
 On April 5, Khan was found guilty of having killed two blackbucks during the shooting of his 1998 movie 'Hum Saath Saath Hain'. He was later granted bail after spending two nights in Jodhpur Central jail.
 
 In his order granting bail, the judge had allowed Khan's application for suspension of sentence for a month against his conviction. He also directed Khan not to leave the country without the court's permission.
 
 Since then, the actor had filed a petition before the Jodhpur District and Sessions Court seeking permission to go abroad, which the court allowed. The actor will be travelling to Canada, Nepal and the USA from May 25 to July 10.
 
 
 Khan’s ‘Hum Saath Saath Hain’co-stars  , Neelam, Tabu and Sonali Bendre, and Jodhpur resident Dushyant Singh - were all acquitted due to lack of evidence.
