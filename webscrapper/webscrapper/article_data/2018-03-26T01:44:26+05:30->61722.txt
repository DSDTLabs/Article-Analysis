GURUGRAM: Two men, involved in separate crimes, were arrested on Friday. The first, Mandeep, alias Mannu, a resident of Bapoda in Bhiwaniwas, was arrested on Friday by the anti-snatching team of police from Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan.

  According to police, Mandeep, 32, used to smuggle alcohol across state borders, especially into Gujarat. A car, allegedly stolen by Mandeep from Gurugram’s Sector 29 in August 2017 was recovered by Rajasthan Police earlier this year. Following this, police got a tip-off about Mandeep’s whereabouts which was used to track him down. 
 
 The accused was sent to judicial custody on Sunday after he was interrogated by police on remand since Friday.
 
 “Last year, he stole a Swift Dzire car parked in front of Kingdom of Dreams, after he attacked the driver,” said a police officer probing the case. 
 
 Police said the accused has had a past criminal record as well. 
 
 The second arrest was of a man allegedly responsible for attacking an auto driver and robbing a passenger in May 2017. A mobile phone and an auto rickshaw were recovered from his possession, solving two cases of robbery. 
 
 Police said Daddan alias Ratan (28), a resident of Gonda in UP, was arrested from near Sai Mandir in DLF Phase 2 on Friday night, and is being questioned in police remand regarding his involvement in other crimes in the city.
