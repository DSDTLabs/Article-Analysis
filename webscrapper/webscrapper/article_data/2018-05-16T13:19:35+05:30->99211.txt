SURAT: The   (SMC) has decided to clean up   creek by using an eco-friendly technology on experimental basis. Microalgae culture would be released at select outlets to control water hyacinth and biological pollutants in the water. If the process is successful,   will use it to check growth of water hyacinth in Tapi river too.

 E A H Pathan, executive engineer at SMC, told TOI, “Talks are on with a firm that deals in microalgae culture for cleaning the water bodies. A team of experts from   led by Dr K D   is conducting investigations in the creek to see the types of pollutants found there.” 
 
 Yadav said, “This creek starts from an agricultural area but we have not found agro water waste so far. What we have found is domestic water waste. We will also be conducting examination on what the algae does and its reactions.” 
 
 A team led by  , chief executive officer of Ram Technologies that works for cleaning water bodies, would introduce microalgae from a spot 1,250 metre downstream in Bhedwad creek. 
 
 “Biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, pH, phosphates, ammoniacal nitrogen, sulphates, chlorides, heavy metals and E-coli bacteria tend to be much higher in quantity than the permissible limits because of uncontrolled polluted discharges into the creek. The creek also has macrophyte and water hyacinth,” said Jayesh Dave.
