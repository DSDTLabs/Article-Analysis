CHANDIGARH: Panjab University’s science departments did not even feature in the top 30 of the subject-wise rankings in the Times Higher Education (THE) Emerging Economies Rankings 2018. The departments including chemistry, physics, maths, geology, psychology, biological sciences failed to make the cut. Though the university has not scored well in sciences,   has upped its game in social sciences, dentistry, languages, fine arts and mass communication.

 While IISC Bangalore has taken the lead in physics and astronomy, IIT Bombay is at number 1 in general engineering. IISC is also a top scorer in mathematics and statistics, computer science and civil engineering.
 
 “We are working with 50% less faculty whereas institutions like IISC Bangalore don’t have such problems. How do you expect us to produce the same output when there is a dearth of faculty? The performance significantly depends on the number of teachers. Now, the UGC has also capped the number of   scholars to be supervised under one professor. Working under such conditions will naturally affect the overall output,” said Devinder Mehta, dean of science faculty, Panjab University.
 
 However, Panjab University’s dental institute, Dr HSJ Institute of Dental Sciences, was the top ranker in the subject-wise rankings, followed by the geography department at number 2 among the Indian institutions. The latter was numero uno as per the Asia rankings (THE). The departments of history, political science, fine arts, mass communication are all at the third spot in the list of Indian institutions. In THE Asia rankings 2018, the history department was at number 1 among the Indian institutions leaving   and   behind. However, these two varsities have taken the lead.
 
 While University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET) was ranked number 6, the Dr SSB UICET claimed the 9th spot with the IITs clearly taking the lead in engineering and technology subjects.
 
 Moreover, the PU’s research score is abysmally low at 8.6. In fact, the universities which are in the slab of 301-350 in the THE Emerging Economies Ranking 2018 have performed better than the Panjab University under the research parameter. “Marvelous papers come out when you do thousands of normal papers. This is where we are lacking. The bulk of publications we need to bring out has gone down. It is almost a decade now that our faculty has been depleting. The result of 10 years’ diminution is being witnessed now. The shortage of faculty is hurting us very much,” said M Rajivlochan, director, internal quality assurance cell (IQAC), PU.
 
 PU’s University Business School (UBS) is ranked at number 7 and the language departments have also acquired the seventh place. In sociology and economics, Panjab University is at number 5 while the department of education is at number 4.
 
 Panjab University is at number 3 in arts and design, while the Jadavpur University has grabbed the top spot in the field. In mass communication, Tezpur University is at number 1, Delhi University at number 2, followed by Panjab University at number 3. In the THE Asia rankings 2018, the department of mass communication was at number 2.
