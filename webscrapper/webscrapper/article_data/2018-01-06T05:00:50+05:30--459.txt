NEW DELHI: The   on Friday quashed proceedings against   officials who had wrongly tried to enter the house of a sitting   judge under mistaken identity to search the premises in connection with a medical admission scam. 

 A bench of Justices A K Sikri and   quashed the FIR lodged against the officials after the agency told the court that it had tendered unconditional apology to the Chief Justice of the HC and the judge concerned for the mistake and it was accepted by them. 
 
 Odisha police had filed a case of trespass against a team of CBI officials trying to enter the house of the sitting judge of the   HC in the intervening night of September 19-20 to conduct a raid. They had gone to raid the house while searching for a former HC judge but he had vacated the premises after retirement seven years back. 
 
 The officials immediately withdrew from the spot after they came to know that a sitting HC judge was residing at the house. The officials had gone there on the basis of information received from internet showing the former judge as occupant of the premises. The agency told the apex court that the mistake was inadvertent and bona fide and the FIR should be quashed as the judge concerned had already accepted the apology. 
 
 “It is submitted and reiterated that the whole incident which happened in the intervening night of September 19-20 was unfortunate yet unintended, inadvertent and bona fide mistake during carrying out of the search warrant. The deponent, on behalf of the entire unit involved in the case, once again expresses an unqualified apology to the institution of the high court as also to the honourable judge, at the entrance of whose residence the team members reached under a bona fide mistake,” CBI said in its affidavit.
