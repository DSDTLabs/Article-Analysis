MANGALURU: It used to be a long haul for Mangaluru   ( ) to get details of vehicles involved in traffic violation earlier from the Regional Transport Offices (RTOs). But not anymore. 

  Soon the MCTP will be equipped with a 'Traffic Automation Centre', which will give every details of the vehicles registered across the state at the touch of a button. The centre is being developed under   (M-TRAC) on the lines of   (B-TRAC) and   (M-TRAC). 
 
 The basic idea is to control and manage traffic and enforce traffic rules in the city that is bursting at the seams managing vehicular traffic density.
 
 In the first phase, the centre will facilitate traffic police to maintain comprehensive records of all the registered vehicles across state including the details of the owners. It will also give a list of offences and violation registered against a particular vehicle.
 
 Thilakchandra, ACP (Traffic), Mangaluru, told TOI that MCTP will get another dozen of handheld devices which will be connected to the automation centre. When a traffic cop enters the registration number of any vehicle, the device displays the complete details of that particular vehicle. 
 
 Any fine or violation against the vehicle is recorded in the centre server. "It will help us to reduce manpower and time to address violation of traffic rules. If the violator fails to pay the prescribed fine, his offences will be compounded with his earlier offences," he added. Another official added that the centre will reduce the burden of police sourcing data from RTOs.
