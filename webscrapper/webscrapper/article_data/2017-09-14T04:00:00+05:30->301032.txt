Mumbai: Union petroleum minister   on Wednesday evening clarified that the state-run   (OMCs) may have to cushion any further rise in crude prices and may not be able to raise petro-product prices to rein in inflation. Pradhanâ€™s clarification came hours after a news reports that OMCs were being prodded by the government to not raise oil prices further which led to sharp slides in stock prices of   (IOC),   (HPCL),   (BPCL) and some other companies from the segment. At close of trade on Wednesday,  , the largest among the oil marketing companies (OMCs,) slid 4.3% to Rs 416 while   crashed 6.2% to Rs 500,   crashed 5.1% to Rs 457, Chennai Petro was down 4.1% at Rs 439 and   lost 3.2% to Rs 134. As a result of the sharp slide in stock prices of OMCs, investors in these companies together lost over Rs 21,000 crore in just one session.

 On Wednesday, Pradhan confirmed that petro product prices were de-regulated and the government had no business to interfere in their working. With the clarification from the government in place, market players feel that stock prices of OMCs would recover the lost ground on Thursday.
