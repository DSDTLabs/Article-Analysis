NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate attached properties of former Congress minister   worth Rs 100 crore in central Delhi's Gole Market area last week in connection with a money laundering case in the Saradha chit fund scam. 

  This is the fifth attachment of assets made by the agency in the Saradha case. With this attachment, the total market value of assets attached so far exceeds Rs 700 crore. A press note from the ED said the properties, located at 7B and C, Doctor's Lane at Gole Market, were provisionally attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). 
 
  The immovable assets belong to Sinh and his estranged wife  , both facing trial in a money laundering case before a special PMLA court in Kolkata. The accused are in judicial custody. 
 
 "The value of the attached immovable properties as on April 2013 was worth approximately Rs 63 crore. However, the present market value of these properties is more than Rs 100 crore," the ED said on the latest attachment.
 
  An attachment under PMLA is aimed at depriving an accused from selling the 'proceeds of crime' before the trial is over. However, the attachment order can be challenged before the adjudicating authority of PMLA within 180 days.
