NEW DELHI: The Centre ruled out on Friday the possibility of opening any window for people to deposit scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes and told the   that the deadline, which ended on December 30, could not be extended. 

  Appearing before a bench of Chief Justice   and Justices D Y Chandrachud and S K Kaul, Attorney General   strongly opposed the plea that those who failed to deposit the notes be allowed to do so by the end of March. He said keeping scrapped notes was itself an offence now and people could be prosecuted for it. 
 
  The Centre was responding to the apex court's notice seeking its response on why citizens who failed to deposit scrapped notes by December 30 be not allowed to do so by March 31, as promised by the Prime Minister on November 8 when the ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes was announced. 
 
  After a brief hearing, the court adjourned the case for March 21 for a detailed hearing. It also said that the notice was issued to the government only to ensure that the Centre was alive to the the prevailing situation. The court was hearing a bunch of petitions accusing the Centre of breach of promise as the PM had assured that people could be able to deposit the scrapped notes till March 31 in offices of RBI. 
 
  As the latest ordinance issued by the Centre restricted deposit of old currency notes to those citizens who were abroad from November 8-December 30, some people questioned the Centre's decision to betray the earlier assurance extended by the PM in his address to the na tion on November 8.
