HYDERABAD: In less than a week of this season's  , police have nabbed over a dozen people for   for the home team's matches in the city. Though thousands of seats were unsold, the black-marketers were still selling tickets in black to cricket-crazy fans. 

 "Of the 38,000 seats up for grabs, only 25,000 were sold, the rest of the stadium was empty. But still tickets were sold in black. We need to check where the ticketing agency is faltering," Rachakonda police commissioner   said. The two raids exposed police's claims of preventing black-marketing of tickets. 
 
 Earlier, while highlighting security arrangements for   matches, Bhagwat had said there were only four centres in the city where people could exchange their receipts for passes. The receipts are generated online after purchasing the ticket. After buying tickets, they have to visit one of the four ticketing counters and exchange them for passes. Though the ticket-holders are supposed to bring a valid ID proof, the Rachakonda commissioner said this rule was being flouted. "We will keep tabs on ticket counters as well," he said. 
 
 On interrogation, police learnt the black-marketers have been sending acquaintances to exchange tickets. "To ensure their movement is inconspicuous, the accused are buying only five or six tickets at a time. They are sending their friends or acquaintances for passes. While they buy tickets for 1,000, they sell them for 5,000 and above," the SOT inspector,   said.
