ERODE: A 49-year-old man allegedly stabbed his partner of a saw mill to death and committed suicide by hanging from the ceiling of the mill at   area near Perundurai here on Saturday over some money dispute.

 The deceased were identified as K  , 51, of Thottiyaseelampatty and E  , 49, of the same village.
 
 Palanisamy, police said, had a saw mill near Perundurai bus stand. “When he shifted the mill to Anbunagar Chettikadu area two years ago, he included Maranaicker as his partner,” an investigating official told TOI.
 
 Palanisamy, he said, used to stay back at the mill at night.
 
 On Saturday, a neighbour saw Maranaicker hanging from the ceiling of the saw mill and informed the Perundurai police. “We found the body of Palanisamy in a pool of blood when we entered inside the mill to retrieve Maranaicker’s body,” the official said.
 
 Both the bodies were sent to the Perundurai government hospital for postmortem. Erode superintendent of police R Sivakumar and deputy superintendent of police P Murugan also visited the spot.
 
 Preliminary investigation revealed that the duo had picked up a quarrel some 20 days ago regarding handling of cash. “Following this, Maranaicker stopped coming to the mill. However, their relatives brokered peace between Palanisamy and Maranaicker,” the official said.
 
 Maranaicker subsequently started to come to the mill as usual. “We suspect that the duo might have picked up another quarrel on Friday night. Maranaicker might have murdered Palanisamy by stabbing him and then committed suicide by hanging,” the investigating official said.
 
 The police have registered a case and further investigation is on.
