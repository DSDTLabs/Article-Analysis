 TOI had first reported that a huge gap had developed between the girders of the   and highlighted that a major disaster was waiting to happen. The Delhi government had commissioned the repair work in December and work was to be started from January 2. However, due to delay in getting permission to divert traffic, the work was postponed. The work was further postponed due to Republic Day celebrations and deadline was shifted to February. But due to metro-related work, PWD didn’t get permission in February and the work was again postponed.
 
 “The gaps have been filled by extension joints. Every flyover has such joints between two girders supported by pillars. In summers, these girders expand while during winters they shrink,” said a senior PWD official. The PWD has also been requested to re-pave the roads under the flyover which was damaged due to the construction work.
