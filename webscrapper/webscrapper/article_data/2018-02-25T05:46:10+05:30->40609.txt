MUMBAI: Tricksters have come up with a new modus operandi of stealing cards from people visiting bank ATMs. Malad (east) resident   (32) became the latest victim when the unidentified man convinced him to hand over his ATM card to show how it can be operated even if it is not linked with Aadhar details.
