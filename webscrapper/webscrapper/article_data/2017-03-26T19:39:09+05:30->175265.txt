VISAKHAPATNAM:   struck a century as India B sealed a place in the final of the   after quelling a spirited challenge from Tamil Nadu by 32 runs, here on Sunday.

 While Pandey's innings of 104 stood out,   (50) and   (51) too came up with handy knocks to help India B put on board a challenging 316 for eight in 50 overs.
 
 Tamil Nadu came up with a strong response through opener   (124) before their challenge fizzled out and they ended at 284 all out in 48.4 overs.
 
 It was the second straight win for India B in the competition, having beaten India A yesterday. Their opponents in Wednesday's final will be either India A or Tamil Nadu, who face each other in a do-or-die match here tomorrow.
 
 The Vijay Hazare Trophy holders were very much in the game as they were 244 for three in the 42nd over but a batting collapse meant they lost the next seven wickets for 40 runs.
 
 Pacer   was effective for India B again, taking three wickets alongside left-arm spinner Axar Patel, who produced an all-around effort after scoring a half century earlier in the day.
 
 It was another good day in the office for Dhawan, who had hit form with a hundred against India A.
 
 It was also a timely knock from Pandey, who has not been able to establish himself in India's limited overs set-up. The stylish right-hander hit five fours and hammered four sixes in his 110-ball innings.
