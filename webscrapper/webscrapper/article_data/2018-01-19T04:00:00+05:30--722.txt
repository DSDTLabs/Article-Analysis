Rajkot: Seven undertrial prisoners of Dhrangadhra sub-jail in Surendranagar district were found in possession of eight cellphones, while six cellphones were found abandoned during an inspection carried out inside the jail by the officials of Surendranagar special operations group (SOG) on Wednesday night.

 A native of Patadi in Surendranagar Rakesh Thokor was found in possession of two cellphones, one cellphone each was recovered from Girirajsinh Vaghela, Paresh Dabhi and Kripalsinh Jhala, all natives of Limbdi; Saurabh Rathod and Vijay Thakor, both natives of Dhrangadhra and Dikshit Jhala, a native of Kuda village of Dhrangadhra.
 
 “Two cellphones were found abandoned in the barrack number six of the jail, while four cellphones did not have SIM cards. We have lodged eight cases against the offenders. We will interrogate them to find out the source from where they had procured the cellphones inside the jail once we get their remand,” said Surendranagar SOG inspector K A Vala, hinting that the possibility of jail officials being involved in the crime could not be ruled out. 
 
 A year ago, too, a cellphone, a SIM card, a cellphone charger and a knife were found during checking in the same jail.
