KOLKATA: Rabindranath  , who renounced knighthood to protest against the   massacre 99 years ago, was referred to as “Sir Rabindranath Tagore” on his 157th birth anniversary in Kolkata in the course of a speech by Union environment and science & technology minister 
 .

 
 Several members of the audience who were listening to the minister’s speech, which came after the inauguration of four refurbished galleries at the Indian Museum, gasped in disbelief. 
  later called up the minister, who said it might have been a “slip of the tongue”.
 
 “I have great admiration for Gurudev and I got a little emotional while praising the great men Kolkata has produced. I cannot recollect in my conscious memory whether I called Tagore Sir or not,” he said. “But what happened was definitely inadvertent,” he added. He heaped generous praise on Tagore and other luminaries after inaugurating the four galleries along with governor Keshari Nath Tripathi.
 
 
 
 
 Three of the four galleries inaugurated on Wednesday belong to the Zoological Survey of India and one to the Botanical Survey of India (BSI).
 
 But Vardhan’s use of the word “Sir” did not go unnoticed.   of NGO PUBLIC, who was among the audience, said: “Yes, we noticed it but his intention was to praise.” Indian Museum officials, too, were taken aback.
 
 “We discussed it later. We are surprised because he is otherwise very thorough about the city and its contribution to India’s freedom movement,” a senior Indian Museum officer said.
 
 Tagore expert Amrita Sudan Bhattacharya, explaining the probable reason for the gaffe, said: “Tagore accepted knighthood and then denounced it. The minister must have been confused.”
 
 The Jallianwala Bagh massacre occurred in April 1919 and there is a growing demand in India to seek a formal apology from the British government before its centenary.
