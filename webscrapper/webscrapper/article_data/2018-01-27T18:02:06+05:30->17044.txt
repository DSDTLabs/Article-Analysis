NEW DELHI:   would unveil portraits of 70 people from   who are recognised as  ,   and  . 

 Among those who are being honoured are  , Ashfaqulla Khan, Bhagat Singh, Birsa Munda and Subhas Chandra Bose. Their portraits would adorn the gallery walls to inspire MLAs and visitors to do better for the society. 
 
 Actually, many of the portraits have already come up as work began six months ago. But all the 70 would be ready to be unveiled on Republic Day. The 70 represent the total assembly constituencies in Delhi. 
 
 Each of the portraits is two-and-a-half feet long and one-and-a-half feet wide. At the bottom of it is given a brief description about the personality. 
 
 “Many of these personalities are unsung. All of them were great freedom fighters and patriots. This historic assembly should become a place to remember the brave freedom fighters, and the visitors should be greatly inspired,” said Speaker Ram Niwas Goel.
 
 Some of the other luminaries are Udham Singh, who had “avenged” the Jallianwala Bagh massacre by assassinating Sir Michael O’Dwyer in 1940; Madan Lal Dhingra who had killed a British official; tribal revolutionary Tilka Manjhi who rose up against the British in the 18th century; and Haryana hero Rao Tula Ram who took part in the Revolt of 1857. 
 
 Though it’s unlikely that there would be any disagreement over the other names chosen, BJP might not be comfortable with Tipu Sultan being there at the gallery, going by events in the past. 
 
 Goel defended the move. “I believe Tipu Sultan was a deshbhakt (patriot), so I have put up a portrait of him. Those who want to see these portraits with a positive perspective can do so, and those who want to see them with a negative perspective can do so too,” the speaker said. 
 
 The portraits have been prepared under the banner of Shaheed Smriti Chetna Samiti.
