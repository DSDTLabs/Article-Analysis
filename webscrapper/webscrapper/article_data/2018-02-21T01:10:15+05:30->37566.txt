Udhagamandalam: A leopard was rescued from a well in Mukkimalai village that falls under the Kundha range in the Nilgiris, on Tuesday.

 The one-and-a-half-year-old animal had fallen into the well near a temple in Mukkimalai, 30km from Ooty, Kundha forest range officer Ramachandran said. “There are three wells near the temple. While one is closed, the other two are open. Local residents, who found the animal, had alerted the department officials,” he told TOI.
 
 “There was water inside the 15 feet deep well. We placed a ladder in the well. After a while, the leopard climbed the ladder, reached the ground and ran into the nearby forest area,” he said. The whole operation took nearly two hours. “We could not assess the sex of the animal,” he added.
 
 The forest officials have asked the panchayat to close the wells immediately. tnn
