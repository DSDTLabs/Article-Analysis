JEWAR:   Rajnath Singh on Thursday wooed the electorate in  , Gautam Budh Nagar, on Thursday, the last day of campaigning for the first phase of the UP assembly election.

 Rajnath Singh arrived to a packed ground and asked the crowd to vote for   candidate Thakur Dhirendra Singh. Incidentally, Dhirendra Singh is the man who drove Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi to Bhatta and Parsaul villages in the district on his bike at the height of the farmers’ agitation in 2011.
 
 He had made the saffron switch last month after the assembly election was announced. In the last assembly election, Dhirendra Singh had contested the Jewar seat and lost to BSP nominee Ved Ram Bhati.
 
 Speaking to the gathering, Rajnath said the BJP has not only changed the disha (direction) but also the dasha (state) of the country after winning the Lok Sabha election with a majority in 2014. “That became possible only because of the UP electorate,” he said.
 
 Making an anti-corruption pitch, he claimed that be it the government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Atal Bihari Vajpayee, not a single minister has faced any graft charge.
 
 As in other poll-bound districts and states, Rajnath mentioned his warnings to Pakistan and the surgical strikes carried out against that country.
 
 Taking about the Akhilesh-led government on development, Rajnath mocked the young chief minister for blaming his uncles, father and relatives for not allowing him to work. Referring to the family feud, Rajnath said that “it was all a ploy to deceive the public.”
 
 In an effort to reach out to voters, he asked, “Have you got compensation for your land or have your villages been connected by permanent roads. Has the administration done anything about illegal mining?”
