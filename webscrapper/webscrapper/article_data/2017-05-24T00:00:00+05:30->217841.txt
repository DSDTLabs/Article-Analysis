Bollywood star   turned up looking dapper in a blue suit and a white shirt for a promotional event held in the city. Speaking on the occasion he said how all eyes are set on Telugu Film Industry since it has given a glimpse of its potential with Bãhubali. 
Recalling his days in the industry, he said that his acting career began in this industry with   directed by Bapu in 1980. “Mere career ke shuruwat isi bhoomi se hui thi, isi zameen se hui thi, Hyderabad mein hui thi. Mumbai mein koi kaam nahi de raha tha. Then the legendary director Bapu saab gave me this film. It was then I landed up in Hyderabad. From here I boarded a train to   to shoot for the film. Agar main aj khada hoon toh bas unke wajah se khada hoon. Bapu saab gave me an opportunity when nobody else was ready to give me a chance,” says the versatile actor. Before starring as the lead actor of Vamsa Vruksham, Kapoor did a small role in Umesh Mehra’s Hamare Tumhare in 1979.
 Raving about how he learnt a lot from the Telugu film industry, he said, “I have learnt a lot from this industry — honesty, integrity, fortitude. That’s why the city and its people hold a special position in my heart. If given an opportunity, I would like to work in Tollywood again.”
 When an enthusiastic fan pointed out that though he began his journey 27 years ago, he looks as dashing as he looked back then, the actor laughed and said, “Yeh Hyderabad ke mitti ka kamal hai. I had haleem before coming here, aur haleem khake josh to aaye ga hi.”
