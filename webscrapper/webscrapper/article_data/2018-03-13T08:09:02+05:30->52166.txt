MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has asked the government why it should not initiate contempt proceedings against officials for their failure in preventing unauthorized hoardings from being erected. 

 The division bench of justices M Sathyanarayanan and   has a sought response on March 16.
 
 The petition was filed in the backdrop of the high courtâ€™s order in February 2014 which stated that hoardings and banners should not be allowed till the issue is studied in depth. The court had also ordered the concerned head of departments to enforce the court order. 
 
 The petitioner also informed the court that social activist   had filed a petition before the high court in 2011 to regulate the erection of digital banners in the state, which led the government to amend the Tamil Nadu Municipal Act in this regard. 
 
 Despite the court order many people had erected unauthorized flex boards and hoardings in many places in Madurai, Trichy,   and   districts. The district collectors, superintendents of police and local inspectors concerned, who are supposed to take action against the violation, failed and thereby allowed the violators to go scott free. 
 
 The petitioner said that the officials committed offences under the IPC by disobeying the direction of law with intent to save person from punishment. 
 
 The petitioner further said that she had sent representation to the officials concerned on March 2 but there was no action on it. Hence, she wanted to take action against the collectors, SPs and inspectors of Madurai, Trichy, Pudukottai and Thanjavur districts.
