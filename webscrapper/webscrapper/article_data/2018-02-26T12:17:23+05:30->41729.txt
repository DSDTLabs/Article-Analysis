Later, Chittemma complained of stomach pain and on examination the doctors found that she had internal hemorrhage. The doctors decided to conduct an hysterectomy, however, Chittemma's condition deteriorated further when her kidneys damaged as urine output stopped. Doctors then referred her to Guntur GGH as they did not have facilities for dialysis. By the time she reached Guntur, she slipped into coma.
