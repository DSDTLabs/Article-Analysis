NEW DELHI: A 14-year-old girl, who allegedly jumped off the   of a government school in northwest Delhi’s Mahendra Park, died on Wednesday. Though the reason for the suicide is still unknown, police have recovered a diary from her bag in which she has written about being   over her studies. Police are now probing if she was harassed by any teacher. 

 The girl’s body was handed over to the family on Wednesday and was cremated at the Nigam Bodh ghat. The cremation was attended by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal as well. 
 
 Sources said the Class IX student was under pressure for not having scored enough, though speculations about her being harassed by a teacher is also being looked into. Police said the diary has been sent for forensic analysis. The source added that since the incident, teachers were also asked to attend to the girl while she was in the hospital on ventilator. 
 
 Additional DCP, (northwest) A K Lall confirmed the death, but refused to reveal details about the reason behind the suicide. 
 
 The girl, however, had not been attending school often due to depression. On Friday afternoon, she climbed to the top of the third-floor staircase at the government school and jumped to death.
 
 Police said none of the CCTV cameras installed at the school were functional. The girl’s family had staged a protest demanding action against the lack of CCTVs at the school. The girl’s father owns a small business and stays at a Gujrati colony near the school. A probe under section 174 CrPC has been initiated.
