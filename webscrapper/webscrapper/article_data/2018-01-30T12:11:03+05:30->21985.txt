DEHRADUN: Over a 100 ministerial employees of the health department in Dehradun began a relay hunger strike on Monday alleging that promotions were being denied to workers nearing retirement. Employees under the aegis of the   Medical and Public Health Ministerial Association ( ) protested outside the DG (health) office.
 
  A ministerial employee told TOI that the structure of the ministerial cadre in the health department was formed in August 2017 after much delay but the department has failed to follow guidelines. Employees said that they decided to strike work after a ministerial employee at the post of senior assistant due to retire on January 31 was not promoted to administrative officer. A significant number of employees who are due for promotion but on the verge of retirement decided to launch a hunger strike after that.
  
   , chairman, UMPHMA, said, “It has been almost six months yet the department is failing to take a call on such simple matters. We do not wish to hamper the work of the department which is why we will sit on a relay hunger strike district-wise. After Dehradun, employees at Haridwar, Nainital and US Nagar will sit on hunger strike.”
  
  Meanwhile, some   from humanities subjects who trained to be auxiliary nurse midwives protested outside the secretariat for not being allowed to meet the CM and the health secretary. According to an Uttarakhand high court order issued last year, only science students can be hired as ANMs.
  
  Chandrakala, patron of Trained Diploma-holder Unemployed Women Healthworkers’ Association, said, “What will happen to around 4,000 humanities-qualified ANMs? The department is adamant to hire only ANMs from science background. There are about 1,000 of them.”
  
  Director general of health and family welfare department, Dr  , said that the matter of the delay in promotions and recruitment of ANMs have been forwarded to higher authorities.
