GANDHINAGAR: Former Rajasthan chief minister and Gujarat Congress in-charge,  , said that  , the former leader of opposition, had tried to pressure the party with demands that he knew the high command would not accept. Gehlot, for the first time, spoke about Vaghela’s demands. He said Vaghela was using the rejection of his demands as an excuse to leave the party, which he had already decided to do due to pressure from BJP.

 Gehlot said Vaghela made three unreasonable demands which he knew the high command would never agree to. “He tried to pressurise the party. He demanded that he be declared the CM candidate, that the state party president be removed, and that he be given full authority to distribute tickets in the 2017 elections,” Gehlot said. “No party will accept such demands. He may be upset because of pressure from few top leaders, otherwise no leader will leave the party when elections are just four months away.”
 
 Gehlot said Vaghela may have succumbed to fear of the BJP through the ED and CBI. He may be getting blackmailed by the BJP. 
 
 “If the BJP tries to nail him, Congress will come out in full support of Vaghela,” Gehlot said. “The party does not hold any grudges about him.”
 
 About the possibility of Vaghela and MLAs loyal to him cross-voting in the   elections, as in the presidential election, Gehlot said, “We hope he will show morality, as he is still a   and must respect what the party gave him all these years.”
