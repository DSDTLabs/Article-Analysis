JAIPUR: Transport minister   on Thursday said separate spaces for bus stands across the state will be arranged for Lok Parivahan Seva (private buses with permits) within next three months. The minister admitted that lack of separate spaces for bus stands led to clashes between the staff of   and private bus operators, who were initially allowed to operate from government bus stands.

  Shankar Singh raised the matter during the question hour while seeking government reply on the clash that took place between private operators and Roadways staff at Beawar bus stand in December last year. The house witnessed arguments between the treasury benches and the opposition members when leader of opposition   chipped in, accusing the government of ‘destroying’ the Rajasthan Roadways.
 
 As Dudi claimed that majority of route permits were granted to private bus operators from Punjab, the transport minister refuted it saying just four out of 1563 permits were given to buses with registration numbers from Punjab. “Moreover, the permits are granted under the Central Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, which does not allow differentiating applicants on the basis of their states,” Khan said.
 
 The minister stressed that, compared to Rs 930.32-crore given to Rajasthan Roadways in five years during the previous Congress government tenure, the present BJP government had already granted Rs 1110.73-crore in past three years.
 
 The house was informed that Roadways maintained a fleet of 4591 buses, on an average, in past 20 years and was providing transport services on nearly 6000 routes across the state. In contrast, the private operators were providing services—through state carriage—on nearly 44,000 routes.
 
 In response to a query by BJP MLA (Chomu)  , the transport minister said in past one year the department opened 1023 routes in rural areas and the legislators can give proposals if new routes were to be opened up in their constituencies.
