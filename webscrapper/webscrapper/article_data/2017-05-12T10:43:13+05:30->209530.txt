NEW DELHI: Surrounded by around a dozen policemen, deployed after the attack on him on Wednesday, sacked   minister Kapil Mishra continued his hunger strike on Thursday and determinedly asked Delhi CM Arvind   to provide details on how the overseas tours of five senior party functionaries were funded. He also promised to make a “big disclosure” on Sunday.

 On the second day of his protest at his residence at Civil Lines, Mishra mocked the “silence of Kejriwal” at his allegations. “I never saw Kejriwal so silent. His silence is revealing,” Mishra said before leaving for the Anti-Corruption Branch to register his complaints the   government’s dilly-dallying in the water tanker scam.
 
 He also attacked his party for claiming that the man who tried to physically assault him on Wednesday was a   man. Saying he was actually associated with a mohalla clinic, Mishra alleged, “Even before police took away the attacker, Sanjay Singh (AAP leader) described him as a   youth wing member. The reaction was so quick that it seems the identity details of the man were known even before the attack.”
 
 Mishra said that his hunger strike would continue unless he got the answers he was seeking on financial details of the foreign tours of some AAP leaders. The former minister insisted that the truth behind “hawala transactions, irregularities in transactions and exchange of cash” would come out if these details were revealed.
 
 He also claimed that he continued to belong to AAP, which he said was a party of honest workers, “barring five-six people”, and reasserted that he would “weed out corruption from the party”.
