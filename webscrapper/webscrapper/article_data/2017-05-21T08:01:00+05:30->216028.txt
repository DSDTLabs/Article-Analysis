GURGAON:   Ghaziabad (DPSG) has “sought advice” from the divisional   on the roadmap ahead after the school gave a detailed explanation of how it was well within the legal framework in issuing a new   structure.

 TOI learned on Saturday that DPSG had written to divisional commissioner D Suresh, who is also chairman of the fee and fund regulatory committee. explaining two issues. One, that it was because of the government’s delay the school hasn’t received recognition yet and second, that it had obtained permission from the state education department, as per 29 (1) of Haryana Education Rules, to start the school afresh under the new name.
 
 The letter written on May 11 requests Suresh to protect the interests of the school students and asked whether the school would be allowed to operate under present circumstances.
 
 Suresh told TOI that he has ordered the school management to meet him on Monday to clear the air. “I want to listen to the concerns of both sides,” he said. “The school has responded to our notice.” The divisional commissioner had disallowed the school from hiking the fee after a meeting on April 8 and had ordered them to refund any excess fee charged . 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Suresh termed the school’s justification “logically wrong”. Asked when his office would receive new guidelines from additional chief secretary P K Das, Suresh said they haven’t got them yet but were expecting them soon.
