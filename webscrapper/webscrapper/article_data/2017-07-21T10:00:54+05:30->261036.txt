CHENNAI: A point for you to consider the next time before you order fish - is that the North Chennai and  , both state owned, are releasing 126 kilo litres per hour of effluent into the Bay of Bengal. The   audit pointed to as high as 6.58 billion mÂ³ of effluent being discharged into the sea without any treatment in the last five years. 

 Despite the unit being asked to set up effluent treatment plants, the station ignored TNPCB's instructions - which has pushed up total dissolved solids (TDS) to 1.13 lakh mg/litre from 52,484 mg/litre at sea. The situation has also aggravated chlorine content in water and pushed it up 20% to 62,480 mg/litre. The CAG report said despite the setting up of ETPs being vital in terms of safety, health hazards and the region's ecosystem, the two plants had delayed setting them up.
