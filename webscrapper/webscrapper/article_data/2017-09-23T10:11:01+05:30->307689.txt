MUMBAI: Battered by a series of poor performances, Sri Lankan cricket has been hit by allegations of matchfixing.

 A couple of months after former Lankan captain   stoked a huge controversy by hinting that the 2011 World Cup final between India and Sri Lanka was fixed, former Sri Lanka pacer and selector   has caused yet another uproar by making similar allegations against Lankan cricketers, who're currently struggling at the international level, in a TV interview.
 
 A rattled   (SLC) has immediately issued a release, in which all their contracted cricketers have demanded an inquiry into Wickremasinghe's allegations, while refuting his claims.
 
 “The national cricketers, including all 40 contracted players have called for an immediate inquiry in to certain 'shocking' allegations made by Wickremasinghe, insinuating unnatural and mysterious match patterns. The cricketers, in a petition signed by all including both (Test & ODI) captains Dinesh Chandimal and   to SLC, have drawn attention to what they say was shockingly disparaging and hurtful statements by Wickremasinghe to a private television station that tend to give the general public a suspicious impression about them,” says the release.
