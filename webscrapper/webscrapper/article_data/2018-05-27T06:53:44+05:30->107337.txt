COLVA: The master storm drain on the periphery of the   (SGPDA) is polluted to the extent that it has started spewing a white foam just like Bengaluruâ€™s   lake, though not in such volume.

 
 The storm drain starts near the Fatorda swimming pool and goes up to Mungul along the road to Colva and empties into low-lying areas.
 
 
  
 
 Most facilities, like the swimming pool, the SGPDA market and its exhibition ground, and even the   bus stand have been built on reclaimed land. This nullah was constructed to drain out rainwater, which otherwise would flood the reclaimed land. Even the area around the   district and sessions court sees water accumulating during the monsoon.
 
 A source from the   (MMC) said that the sewage from the market, which was being released in the master storm drain, was the cause of the pollution. Besides sewage, the drain is also full of plastic bottles.
 
 Since earlier this week, a small amount of foam has been seen accumulating at the mouth of the master drain.
 
  councillor Lyndon   said that only part of the master drain, near the swimming pool, is cleaned, and that the entire stretch, which is more than a kilometre long, has never been cleared. When the froth was brought to his notice, he said the council does not have the machinery required to clean the drain. Pereira said he would ask the water resources department, through the local MLA Vijai Sardesai, to do the needful.
 
 A study conducted in 2008 by the department of environmental science, Bangalore University, for the ministry of environment forest and climate change states that formation of foam indicates presence of nitrates above the permissible level. The nitrates come from urine and faecal matter.
 
 Soaps and detergents are sources of sulphates and phosphates. When the mixture of nitrates, sulphates and sewage flow through the drain over stones, a lather is formed.
