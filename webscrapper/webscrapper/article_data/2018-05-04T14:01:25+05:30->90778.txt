 director   said he loved hanging out with Indians when he came to the country. "Well, when I got to India, I didn't know the culture well but I got to understand the people, hang out with them, work with them, laugh with them, cry with them, and at the end, I didn't want to leave India," Hui said in a statement .

  
  
 "There were also things I didn't understand there, stuff I didn't get, but at the same time I totally understand why, being them, they would do things in a certain way. I think it's the same with China too," he added, without telling when and what brought him to India. 
 
 On the idea of doing a Sino-India co-production, he said, "That would be great because I understand both India and China. If one day there's a need for a Chinese and Indian cross-culture movie I would be very interested to be involved."
 
 "I was living in India when   was released there, and I even know how to sing some of the songs in the movie."
