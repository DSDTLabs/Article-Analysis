BHUBANESWAR: The   (PRIs) and the   (ULBs) are going to receive over Rs 4,800 crore in the forthcoming fiscal. 

 As the state government tries to strengthen  , it has earmarked Rs 3,344 crore, the highest ever allocation, for the PRIs in the annual budget for 2017-18. The allocations were made according to the recommendations of the 4th state and 14th   (FC) constituted for a period of five years from 2015-16 onwards.
 
 "The allocation will enable them to provide basic services to the rural population and create community assets to increase their earning," said an officer in the finance department. 
 
 The grant to the PRIs in the current fiscal was Rs 2,181 crore.
 
 According to sources in the panchayati raj department, over Rs 137 crore was spent by the PRIs in 2015-16 to create more than 1,000 assets such as 358 kalyan mandaps, 527 market complexes and 189 village haats (market) and orchards among others. 
 
 In the current fiscal, the PRIs have so far spent nearly 139 crore to develop 436 kalyan mandaps, 326 market complex and 196 village haats and orchards.
 
 "It's good that the government is transferring substantial amount to the PRIs for strengthening basic services according to the recommendations of the finance commissions. But the state government needs to take steps to fill up the vacancies in the gram panchayat and block offices for effective utilization of the funds," former finance minister Prafulla Ghadai said.
 
 The state government has earmarked Rs 1,468 crore for ULBs in the 2017-18 fiscal, lower than what it was allocated last year. The amount would be spent on improvement of drainage system, providing LED lights and development of roads in urban areas besides developing parks, gym, godowns and graveyards, an official source said. The ULBs had received finance commission grants worth Rs 2,445 crore in the current fiscal.
