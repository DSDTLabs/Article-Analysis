COIMBATORE: With unauthorised hoardings mushrooming in the city again, civic activists have filed a petition with the city corporation seeking action against the violators. In the last 15 days alone, the corporation had removed about 168 such hoardings installed across the city.

 Corporation officials said that they have launched an extensive drive to remove illegal hoardings. “We removed most of these hoardings from residential areas. Several building owners had set them up without getting no-objection certificate from the corporation and the police department,” an assistant town planning officer said.
 
 Corporation officials said that since October 2016, as many as 1,198 hoardings were removed from the east zone, 2,247 from the west zone, 1,006 from north zone, 158 from south zone and 1,805 from central zone. “A total of 6,414 hoardings were removed and we are continuing the drive,” he told TOI.
 
 As per norms, those who want to set up an advertisement hoarding should get permission from several departments if it is on government buildings. To set up temporary hoardings, an application has to be submitted to the revenue divisional officer/sub-collector concerned, enclosing the NOC from the building owner or AEE/ADE (for government buildings), NOC from the police station concerned and the challan for payment of licence fee for 15 days before the erection of the hoarding. After scrutiny of the application, permission would be granted for erecting the hoarding for a maximum of six days. The revenue earned is shared by the corporation and the district administration.
 
 Real estate companies and apartment owners still install hoardings along city roads and inside their campuses without getting permission, civic activist SP Thiyagarajan said. “Apart from causing road accidents and traffic violations, the illegal hoardings lead to huge revenue loss to the government,” he said.
