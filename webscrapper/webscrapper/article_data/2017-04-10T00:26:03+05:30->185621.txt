Trichy: Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president S Thirunavukkarasar has urged to make public the content of documents seized by the income tax department from the house of health minister C Vijayabaskar. 

 Speaking to the media at Thanjavur he said he welcome the IT raids but at the same time doubts the timing of raids. 
 
 “Though there have been reports that significant documents were seized from Vijayabaskar’s home, no one really knows about the details. The details must be made public,” he said.
 
 “Raids at the place of ruling party minister just a week ago will make particular candidate weak,” said Thirunavukkarasar, adding that nothing will change even if the bypoll at R K Nagar are postponed. “It should not be cancelled or postponed at this juncture,” he said. 
 
 Stating that there has not been stable governance from the last one year in the state, the former union minister said that not only former chief minister J Jayalalithaa was in a coma but state was too over the last one year. 
 
 While expressing support to the agitating farmers at Thanjavur, ha said that most of the state is drought hit and the ruling government is busy with the by-election.
 
 Alleging the state and Central governments of handling the farmer’s issues in an unconcerned way, he said neither Prime Minister Narendra Modi found it necessary to meet the farmers protesting in New Delhi nor did the state government pay heed to the farmers protest at Thanjavur. 
 
 Citing allocation of Rs4,000 crore for draught as inadequate as against the state’s demand for Rs39,000 crore, Thirunavukkarasar said that the BJP government has been consistently ignoring the state.
 
 “The state government should implement the Supreme Court’s direction by waiving farmer loans in cooperative banks. Similarly, the Union government should waive farmer loans in nationalised bank,” he said.
