Rising Patel leader, and possibly the most painful thorn in BJP’s side at this point in Gujarat,   arrived in Mumbai late last night for a Tuesday noon meeting with   chief Uddhav Thackeray at Matoshree in Bandra.

 Patel told Mumbai Mirror that he will campaign for Sena’s BMC elections candidate from Goregaon, Biren Limbachya, and that he was looking to align with “like-minded people”. “I have grown up idolising Bhagat Singh and Balasaheb Thackeray, and I am extremely happy to be in the land of Veer Savarkar,” he said.
 
 Patel will be a part of a road show organised by the Patel Navnirman Sena in Goregaon on Tuesday evening. He will also address a meeting immediately after. The event will also be attended by Sena leader and Industries Minister Subhash Desai, who confirmed Patel will ask for votes for Limbachya.
 
 Patel, who recently returned from his exile in Rajasthan to Gujarat and was welcomed by cries of ‘dekho dekho kaun aaya,   tera baap aaya’ has vowed to destroy BJP in Gujarat. With the Sena and BJP contesting the forthcoming municipal polls independent of each other for the first time in nearly two decades, Patel could be a potent shot in the Sena’s armoury.
 
 The Shiv Sena has 11 Gujarati candidates, the highest number it has ever had in its electoral history in Mumbai’s municipal elections.
 
 Patel landed on an Air India flight from Ahmedabad late on Monday evening and headed straight to Sofitel Hotel in Bandra-Kurla Complex, which is located a short distance from Matoshree.
 
 Patel is currently leading a high-decibel campaign in Gujarat for the inclusion of Patels in the Other Backward Classes category, guaranteeing them seats in professional colleges and government jobs. He could prove to be big draw for the Gujaratis in Mumbai, who are known BJP supporters.
 
 Regarding his meeting with Uddhav, Patel said he was open to all options. “We are looking for azaadi from the slavery imposed on us,” he said, in an obvious reference to Narendra Modi.
