LUCKNOW: Police finally succeeded in cracking the   in which   technician Veena Mehrotra was found murdered in her house on January 20. Veena was stabbed to death by  , an employee at the shop of Veena’s husband Rajeev, said police after arresting the accused.

 Police was able to solve the murder when Goswami was spotted near Mehrotra’s house in CCTV footage and his mobile location was found in   even though he had informed that he would not be coming to work. Goswami lives in   and travels to work daily via train. The cops recovered jewellery from the cavity of a sofa in the house on his confession.
 
 Laxmikant had been working at Rajeev’s shop since long and was trusted and often assigned household work. He continued working at the shop after the murder and was arrested even the ‘terahwi’ on Monday.
 
 Goswami confessed that he overheard the couple talking about Rs 25 lakhs they had got recently. He planned the loot and reached the shop early to see if Rajeev had arrived. He reached Mehrotra’s house at 10.55am and hid in the ground floor godown and kept watch on the gate. When Rajeev left for shop, Laxmikant went straight to the bedroom upstairs.
 
 Veena, who was in the kitchen, came on hearing noise while holding a knife. She asked Laxmikant what was he doing there.
 
 “Laxmikant told her to hand over Rs 25 lakh but Veena shouted and picked her phone to call Rajeev. Laxmikant snatched the knife and stabbed her. When Veena fell down he attacked her with a rod and cut her throat and wrists. He later opened the safe and took out jewellery and cash in it,” said CO Kaiserbagh Amit Rai.
 
 Laxmikant soon ran out of luck as Rajeev’s sister-in-law rang the doorbell. In fear, he hid the booty in a sofa cavity and went to the roof from where he jumped to adjacent coaching institute building and fled .
 
 ASP (West) Vikas Tripathi said, “We got some CCTV footage and saw a man of Laxmikant’s physique hurrying towards the main road. Rajeev identified him.”
