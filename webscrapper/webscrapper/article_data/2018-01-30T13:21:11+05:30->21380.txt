TIRUNELVELI: Members of the Tamil   on Monday petitioned the   collector seeking relief from the stringent norms and deposit fees they have to pay police to obtain permission to perform at temple festivals.

  general secretary of the association, M   said the high court and police have been enforcing stringent norms to conduct dance programmes at temple festivals for close to a decade. “But the enforcement is very strict over the last one year especially in Tirunelveli,” he said.   said that there are more than 800 artistes in the 45 dance troupes in the district and close to one lakh people, including more than 30,000 women artistes, for whom performing on stage is the only source of livelihood. “We charge Rs 30,000 for small temple festivals. It goes up to Rs 3 lakh for mega events, but it is a rarity,” he said.
 
 Due to denial of police permission to organise such events, they are forced to go to the court and spend around Rs 5,000 to 6,000 to get permission for every event. “In addition to it, we have to pay a caution deposit ranging from Rs 10,500 to 25,000 to the treasury of the district police for every event,” he claimed.
 
 Though it is a refundable deposit, there have not been many instances of the deposit reaching the artistes. “Persons organising the event are not ready to hire us by spending such heavy amounts, as it hits their budget. So they are opting for other forms of entertainment at temple events. This is badly affecting our livelihood,” he added. In his representation district president of the association,   appealed to the government and police department to waive off the caution deposit and to grant them permission to perform at such events from 7pm to 10pm.
