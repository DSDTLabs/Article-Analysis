Actor Margot   said she wants a fiery end to the quirky relationship between Joker and her "Suicide Squad" character   in the forthcoming spin-off.

 The 27-year-old actor, who will reprise her role along with on-screen lover Jared Leto in a movie soon, said the love story of the two villains deserves nothing less than an explosive climax, reported BANG Showbiz.
 
 "Their love story has to end in flames! It has to, it just wouldn't be right," Robbie said.
 
 The actor had previously said that she hopes the spin-off would be a "love story" and suggested it would be interesting to watch Joker and Quinn die for each other.
 
 "I'm personally a sucker for a love story. In any iteration. I think people enjoy seeing two characters who, in   and Joker's case, would die for one another. It's kind of romantic in a messed up way," she said.
 
 The film will be directed by   and John Requa.
