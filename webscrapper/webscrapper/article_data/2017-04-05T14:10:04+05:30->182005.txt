PUNE: The   police on Tuesday booked a couple for refusing to register the sale deed agreement of a flat they had sold to a shoe businessman for Rs35 lakh in 2008.

 The fraud came to light after Basit   (40) of Kondhwa filed a complaint against Ayub Patwekar and his wife  , both of Nana Peth.
 
 Shaikh had purchased a 3-BHK flat measuring 1,350 sq ft at   in Kondhwa from Patwekar by paying Rs10 lakh in cash on June 7, 2008. Patwekar had agreed to take the balance amount of Rs25 lakh in installments.
 
 Shaikh said he had paid his dues to Patwekar between July 7, 2008 and April 5, 2012 through demand drafts, cheques and cash and had asked for the deed in his name.
 
 However, even as Shaikh arranged the property documents and bore the other necessary expenses totally worth over Rs1.65 lakh, the couple avoided turning up at the sub-registrar office giving various excuses.
