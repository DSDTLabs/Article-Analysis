CHANDIGARH:   students from now on will participate along with the students from nursing or technical courses at the   ( )-32 in all sports events. On the 25th annual sports meet in the college, which concluded on Sunday, for the first time doctors, nurses and medical technicians participated in the sports meet together.

 The technical and nursing students used to compete amongst each other, while the MBBS students did not participate at all. This system has been done away with during the recent annual sports meet after some objections were raised to the director principal (DP) of the college about the same. The proposal for an inclusive participation had been sent to the  . “We didn’t feel that we were in a college studying with the MBBS students as we hardly had a common forum. When it comes to sports, we all are students and hence the competitions should be held together,” said a B.Sc medical technology student.
 
 
 “We have to work like a team in the hospital. And if there are such events where all the health workers are not allowed to participate, we cannot teach them equality,” said Dr  , (DP) who took the initiative.
 
 “We have two categories. One is for the undergraduates which includes the medical students and the technologists. In another category, the post graduate students including the doctors and the MPhils/research students participate,” said a faculty member.
 
 “From now onwards we will have equal participation for all. When I joined as the DP recently, I thought it would be the best to remove any kind of barrier of discrimination in the medical college,” said Dr Chavan.
