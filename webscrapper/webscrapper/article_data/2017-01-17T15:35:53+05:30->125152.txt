NEW DELHI: The International Monetary Fund ( ) on Monday cut India’s economic growth estimate for 2016-17 to 6.6% from its earlier projection of 7.6% due to the impact of the government’s move to scrap some high value currency notes in early November.

 The agency raised China’s   growth estimate for 2016-17 to 6.7% from the earlier 6.5%. If the projections are realised then India risks losing the "fastest growing major economy" tag. IMF expects the economy to recover and grow by 7.2% in 2017-18, still slower than the previous estimate of 7.6%. In 2018-19, it expects the Indian economy to grow by 7.7%.
 
 "In India, the growth forecast for the current (2016–17) and next fiscal year were trimmed by one percentage point and 0.4 percentage point, respectively, primarily due to temporary negative consumption shock induced by cash shortages and payment disruptions associated with the recent currency note withdrawal and exchange initiative," the IMF said in its   update. The forecasts are for calendar year for several economies, while for India it is based on the fiscal year (April to March).
 
 
  
 IMF has so far maintained that India is a bright spot against the gloomy global economic outlook. But its January estimate shows that the multilateral agency expects a larger dent to the economy due to demonetisation.
 
 Several multilateral agencies, RBI and economists have cut India’s growth estimates after the demonetisation drive. Earlier this month, the World Bank cut the country’s growth estimate to 7% for 2016-17 from its previous projection of 7.6%. RBI has also lowered its GDP growth estimate for the current fiscal to 7.1% from 7.6%. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) in its latest estimate expects the economy to grow by 7.1% in 2016-17, lower than the previous projection of 7.6%. But this estimate does not take into account the impact of demonetisation. Several economists say that growth will slip below 7% in 2016-17 due to the impact of cash crunch on several sectors such as real estate, farming, consumers, small and medium industries and others. The IMF revised upwards China’s estimate based on expectations of a stimulus. "Near-term growth prospects were revised up for China, due to expected policy stimulus, but were revised down for a number of other large economies - most notably India, Brazil, and Mexico.   is projected to grow by 6.5% in 2017 and 6% in 2018, slower than India’s growth in both years."
 
 Global growth for 2016 is now estimated at 3.1%, in line with the October 2016 forecast. Advanced economies are now projected to grow by 1.9% in 2017 and 2% in 2018, 0.1 and 0.2 percentage points more respectively compared to the October forecast.
