THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Congress leader and former KPCC president   alleged that despite having differences in almost all issues, the LDF constituents stood united to help Harrisons Plantations for getting favour in the high court. The shifting of Susheela Bhat from the government pleader post itself proves the fact that the government was favouring Harrisons Plantations. It is nothing but a conspiracy well-orchestrated by both the CPI and CPM with the plantation company.

 Even though the chief minister had claimed after the allparty meeting in May 2017 that all the encroachments will be evicted, the government has not taken back even an inch of a land till now, Sudheeran said.
 
 
 All the steps for evicting the encroachments have been   the government. This has become evident in this case with the government acting in favour of the encroachers.
 
 The high court had on Wednesday set aside the orders of special officer   for taking over around 38,000 acres of land in possession of   Ltd under the Kerala Land Conservancy Act.
