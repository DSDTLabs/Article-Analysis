MUMBAI: Churches have devised ways to continue with outdoor mass at   and Easter while remaining within the confines of   pollution norms. Some will dissipate sound over a large area by using multiple small speakers. Others will shift the loudspeakers inside the premises of their adjacent schools instead of installing them on the open ground.

 Acting on a Bombay high court order on silence zones, police in certain locations had denied permission for outdoor mass this season.
 
 Holy Name Cathedral in Colaba will affix loudspeakers inside the corridor of its school, not in the open ground. Sound levels will be monitored. IC Church, Borivli, will place several small speakers at a low volume across its grounds rather than use large sound systems. Mt Carmel Church in Bandra will keep within the prescribed   level.
 
 TOI reader Nikhil Shah, an architect, suggests, “One can connect through mobile phone or individual headphones or both. Every person who wants to attend can connect via an app and plug in to the prayer or festival. The church has an app, you can download it, log in and listen at the same time, anywhere. It does not disturb anyone.”
 
 The holy   is commonly associated with Christmas, however, St Pius X Church in Mulund has prepared a crib for Good Friday. “It depicts the Last Supper that Jesus Christ had with his disciples,” said parish priest Cleophas Fernandes.
