HYDERABAD: The municipal administration and urban development ( ) department issued a GO extending the date for accepting layout regularisation scheme (LRS) forms to April 30, but   ( ) circle offices are refusing to accept applications from residents on the grounds that they have not received any order on the extension of  . 

 Sources said utter confusion is prevailing in several circles as the staffers have not received instructions on disposing of pending LRS applications. Making matters worse, several applicants complained that the circle office employees are not accepting fee payment as well as clearing pending documents. "I received a letter on March 31 to pay the LRS fee to get my layout regularised and I had gone to a circle office after two days with a DD but I had to return as I was told that the server was not working. When I visited the office again, the staffers simply refused to accept the payment saying they haven't received any instructions," advocate Venugopal Reddy said.
 
 He further said, "They are accepting applications only if the fee is paid before March 27." His application is still stuck in the GHMC north zone circle office. Sources said this ambiguity is certainly making residents go round and round.
 
 Sources said the MAUD order said the extension is applicable for pending applications which were received till March 31. But, officials in GHMC blamed it on poor drafting of the order which has led to this confusion. "We have written a letter to MAUD officials to clear the air. We are waiting for their reply, said  , director, GHMC house numbering cell (HNC). This cell takes care of clearing and vetting LRS applications.
 
 K Srinivas Varma, general secretary of Lok Satta, Greater Hyderabad, criticised the GHMC apathy, saying that several residents did not receive approval letters for the payments made in February.
