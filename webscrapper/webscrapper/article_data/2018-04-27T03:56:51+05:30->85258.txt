Ghaziabad: The   ( ) cell has recommended assimilation of   falling on either sides of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and Delhi-Meerut Expressway within GDA’s jurisdiction. The GDA will now present the proposal during its board meeting before sending it to the state government for final approval.

 Of 77 villages, 31 of them fall in Baghpat district Kekhra tehsil, while the remaining are in Loni and Modinagar in Ghaziabad. Only villages that fall within 500 metres of the two expressways have been selected. 
 
 The NCR planning cell had sent reminders to GDA many times in the past but no action had been taken.
 
 Ishtiyaque Ahmad, chief architect and town planner (CATP), GDA, said, “We received a reminder from the NCR planning cell requesting to bring 77 villages falling in Baghpat, Loni and Modinagar under the ambit of GDA. The proposal will be presented at the GDA’s next board meeting and then sent to the state government for final vetting.” 
 
 S C Gaur, co-ordinator and planner at NCR planning cell, said, “These villages fall on both sides of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and Delhi-Meerut Expressway. Once both the expressways are commissioned, villages in and around these roads will see exponential growth. However, if there is no development agency monitoring this growth it would be unplanned which is why a proposal by NCR planning cell was mooted in 2011-12 but since then no substantial progress was made.”
 
 He further said, “Now that the   is close to be commissioned a reminder has been sent to the GDA to act on the issue soon.”
