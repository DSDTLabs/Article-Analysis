THANE: His cool quotient, a soft demeanor and the famous pensive look reveals very little about   who charted the Shiv Sena to a comfortable victory securing a clear majority of 67 seats in the 131-member   general body in the lake city.

 While there is some mystery as to whether the party workers and the mid-rung functionaries revere him or fear him more, the 53-year-old man of the masses has risen the ranks from being a shakha pramukh in the dense Wagle Estate area to an undisputed leader.
 
 Not only has Shinde built the party and strengthened the base in   and neighbouring Kalyan-Dombivli, post the demise of Sena leader Anand Dighe, he is considered an ace political strategists having wrestled down not only his bete noirs within the party, but winning friends in the other political parties as well.
 
 “He is the one-point stop for anyone who is in any kind of distress. Unlike most political leaders who would weigh the political and financial consequences of any act to support or aid someone, Shinde sahib has never shied away from extending any assistance and is most accessible to all who flock to his darbar till 3 am almost every day,” said a local from the city.
 
 Popular in the political circles as a man who would keep his word, insiders said the Sena’s victory in Thane against the powerful BJP and in spite of the changing demographic is due to the Shinde strategic planning right from choosing the candidates to silencing the defectors.
