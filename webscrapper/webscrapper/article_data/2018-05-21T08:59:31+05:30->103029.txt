JAMMU: In yet another  , Pakistani Rangers on Monday fired mortar shells on border outposts at several places in   and Kashmir's   sector, prompting retaliation by the   personnel guarding the international border.

 The mortar firing from across the border started around 7:00am in Arnia sector of Jammu and was still continuing when last reports were received, a senior   official said.
 
 "Three border outposts are under fire from the Pakistani Rangers and the personnel deployed there are also retaliating to silence the Pakistani guns," the official said.
 
 "However, there was no immediate report of any casualty in the shelling," he said.
 
 On Sunday night, Pakistani troops fired small arms and mortars, targeting Narayanpur area of Ramgarh sector in   district, hours after "pleading" with the BSF to stop firing, after being pounded with heavy artillery that left a trooper dead across the border.
 
 The BSF also released a 19-second thermal-imagery footage, showing the destruction of a Pakistani picket across the border, in retaliation to the unprovoked firing and shelling along the IB.
 
 The BSF has lost two of its jawans in the latest round of unprovoked firing along the IB in Jammu region since May 15.
 
 Four civilians were killed and 11 others injured on Friday in the Jammu area due to the firing, which increased in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's day-long visit to Jammu and Kashmir on May 19.
 
 The state has witnessed a spurt in Pakistani shelling and firing along the IB and the   (LoC) this year.
 
 Over 700 such incidents have been reported this year, which have left 38 people, including 18 security personnel, dead and scores injured.
