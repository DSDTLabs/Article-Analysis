Amritsar: While admitting that there was a stagnation in the agriculture sector, chief principal secretary to chief minister Amarinder Singh, Suresh Kumar, said the state government couldn’t even think about abolishing the free power facility given to the farmers. 

 Kumar was addressing the ‘Agri Summit 2018’ here on Friday. Suresh said that the dire need of the hour was to save the underground water, as well as, to enhance the income of farming community by minimizing the production cost.
 
 “At present, the state government was providing power subsidy to the farmers up to Rs 6,000 crore annually against the total crop production of Rs 50,000 crore. If the government slashed the power subsidy, farming community will suffer huge economic setback,” he said.
 
 However, the chief principle secretary advocated for the invention of new techniques in agrarian sector. “Crop diversification will be possible only if the farmers get more price of their crop against the traditional crop pattern of wheat and paddy,” he observed.
 
 On the occasion,   chairman Kahan Singh Pannu suggested the farmers to become trades of their own crop to enhance their earnings. “The agricultural department must approach the farmers at grass-root level to provide much needed guidance to understand the national and international market trends,” he suggested.
 
 Among others who addressed the seminar included deputy commissioner Kamalseep Singh Sangha, Guru Nanak Dev   vice-chancellor Jaspal Singh Sandhu.
