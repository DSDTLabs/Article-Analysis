KOHIMA: Nagaland chief minister   on Monday said his government does not want to confront organizations protesting against 33% preservation for women in urban local bodies. 

 In a seven-minute radio broadcast from Kohima, Zeliang said, "Not wishing to confront protesting organisations, my government gave in to their demands to postpone polls to ULBs and declared the elections held on February 1 as null and void. From the very beginning, organisations such as the   (JCC) had been asking time so that they can have dialogue with various tribal organisations to ensure a well-informed election which will promote development for all Nagas. So, it is not fair that organisations and individuals are not allowed to come to the meetings convened by the government."
 
 He added, "My government had a series of discussions with various tribal organisations regarding the obligations to uphold the provisions of the Constitution as long as we are within the Union of India. And holding of elections to urban local bodies with 33% reservation of seats for women was one of them. In 2016, the government had 14 consultative meetings with civil organisations on the issue of elections to the ULBs as amended by the   in 2006. The government also met the recently-formed JCC in Kohima and at Chumukedima in the presence of Nagaland Baptist Church Council ( ) officials."
 
 He appealed to all sections of society to preserve the good image of tribal organisations. The tribal organisations should come forward for sharing their views without any bias or hesitation. He also urged agitating tribal groups to lift the bandh so that students can appear in their examinations. "We must not sacrifice the future of Naga society by confronting each other. After all, the larger benefit for the whole society must be given more importance than any individual or a few," he said.
