GUWAHATI: In a first,   (GU) has adopted the Karbi-inhabited   village, the inhabitants of which are mostly impoverished and ignored by governments old and new. The village, located in Morigaon district and bordering  , has a population of more than 500 but lacks basic civic amenities and healthcare and education facilities. The economy of the village, which comprises Kuthori Teron Gaon and Kuthori-Kro Gaon hamlets, is agrarian but tribals here practise subsistence farming due to the absence of a proper irrigation system.

 As a GU team trudged along the worn-out road to meet the tribesmen of Kuthori Karbi, the journey itself reminded them of the mammoth challenge ahead. "People of this village have to travel five kilometres to NH-37 on foot or on cycles as the transportation system has not developed in the area. Though the village is not far away from the national highway and the fairly developed township of Jagiroad, the Karbis here live a life of isolation," said convener of GU's community outreach programme, Dwipen Bezbaruah.
 
 The nearest government healthcare centre is about 10 kilometres away from the Kuthori Teron Gaon. The poor road poses a big hurdle for ambulances during emergencies. Pradip Teron, a student, said load-shedding was a common occurrence in the village. The village has only a dilapidated lower primary school to cater to youngsters, said director of students welfare at GU, Ranjan Kumar Kakati.
 
 According to locals, only five people from the village have gone on to college; an equal number have got any kind of a job. Attending a recent event in the village as chief guest, GU vice-chancellor   said the university would work for the development of the village education system and improve the villagers' social life. He announced that GU would also provide scholarships to the few students from the village who were studying in colleges and universities.
