COIMBATORE: Even after three years and facing a barrage of complaints, the city corporation has not yet fixed cracks in the drinking water distribution pipeline that pass between   and Selvampathy lakes.

 The pipeline has been leaking for several years, residents living along the lakes said. “Every time water is supplied through the pipelines, it leaks into the lakes. Several kilolitres of water gets wasted daily this way. Also, lake water contaminated by sewage enters the pipeline,”  , a resident, said.
 
 Anand, an environmentalist, who visited the lake for survey and cleaning activities, said he has seen locals using the leakage points to draw water. “Local men have showed us how to collect water from the leaking points. But, no action has been taken,” said  . The pipeline extends up to the crematorium at Chokkam Pudur. 
 
 Many residents have informed the corporation engineers about the contaminated water supply. “The engineers have always said that they will look into it but no action has been taken. During summers, the water loss is lesser as the supply is not very frequent,” said Anand.
 
 R Manikandan, another activist, said he had also informally reported it to the corporation engineers. “We are really bothered about contamination of sewage water,” he said.
 
 Senior engineers in the city corporation told TOI that they will inspect the area and plug the leakage immediately.
