BENGALURU: The   (BBMP) is at it again. Though it failed to implement   at source on several occasions in the past, the civic body has decided to “strictly“ implement it, starting Wednesday. It is also talking about penalties, which will be levied on households which continue to hand over mixed waste, after the grace period ends on February 10.

 If   refuse to pay up, the penalty will be added to their property tax. In the case of rented accommodation, the fine will be added to the   paid by the landlord.
 
 Currently, in most wards, wet and dry waste is picked up simultaneously. From Wednesday,   will be picked up every day, while dry waste will be picked up only twice a week.
 
 Civic officials said they have instructed pourakarmikas to refuse waste in the mixed form. “Once the system gets going well with individual households, we will start working on streamlining bulk generators like big apartments and commercial establishments. We will also collect sanitary waste (diapers, sanitary napkins etc) as several residents feel this cannot be kept at home for long,“ said a senior official with the solid waste management section of BBMP.
 
 So how different is the drive on waste segregation this time? Sarfaraz Khan, joint commissioner, solid waste management, BBMP, said they have good systems in place this time. “We've streamlined garbage transport to processing units. We are also working closely with resident welfare associations, contractors and corporators at the ward level to ensure success,“ he added.
 
 Though the city generates about 4,200 tonnes of waste every day, segregation at source is still below 40%.“With the new segregation drive, we are hopeful of increasing the segregation level to 60%. We are also planning to strengthen our dry waste collection centres with the help of NGOs,“ said another official from the BBMP .
