HYDERABAD: TPCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy threw a challenge at chief minister   asking whether he would take political sanyas if TRS fails to win 106 seats in 2018-19 polls as claimed. "I will resign from politics if Congress fails to win the Assembly elections," he said while addressing public meetings at Zaheerabad and Narayankhed constituencies on Wednesday. 

 Former Union minister   said that Uttam Kumar Reddy is the chief ministerial candidate of Congress. Though this was not an official announcement, many Congress leaders close to Uttam were elated that none of the leaders present on the dais opposed the statement. Those on the dais when Sarve made this statement include   and most importantly  , a known opponent of Uttam.
 
 Leaders close to Komatireddy said it was for the party high command to decide the CM candidate. Projecting CM candidate is not Congress culture and such moves are going to impact the bus yatra with possible infighting, said leaders. Uttam said the next Congress government will abolish Rythu Samanvaya Samithis. He said Congress was making only those promises which are implementable. "KCR is doing Modi's chamchagiri (sycophancy). Whatever Modi does, KCR is supporting him. Is it due to fear, respect or something else?" he asked.
 
 Meanwhile, Uttam gave Rs 1 lakh to the widow of cotton farmer   who committed suicide due to debts.
