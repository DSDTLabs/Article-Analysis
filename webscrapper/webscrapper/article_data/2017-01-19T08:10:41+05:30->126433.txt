BENGALURU: Between 2010 and 2015, Karnataka saw 20 cases of  . For long now, activists have been demanding curbs on easy   in the market, but in vain.

 Back in 2013, the   pulled up the states for allowing open sale of acid. Three years on, nothing has changed, with no check whatsoever on sale of acid. In the absence of proper documentation, the liquid is available in the market for as cheap as Rs 50 per 100ml. 
 
 Haseena Hussian, a 35-year-old acid-attack victim, who is at the forefront of campaigns against such cases in the state, said: “There could be several reasons to justify availability of acid in the market, but no argument can be more compelling than the fact that it poses a threat to human life. Last year, two of the acid-attack victims were children.”
 
 “The idea behind such attacks is to disfigure the other person. There have been cases were hot oil was thrown on the victim. The thrust should be on changing mindsets. And people like me hope to be able to contribute towards this change,” she added. 
 
 A recent plea by two sisters and acid-attack victims at Delhi High Court to increase the compensation amount has raised hopes among activists. At present, the government gives Rs 3 lakh in compensation. However, cost of treatment can spiral to massive amounts over the years. 
 
 Recently, a city court sentenced a man, who threw acid on his wife, to life imprisonment. This was following an amendment to the IPC, which incorporated specific provisions (Sections 326A and 326B) to deal with such cases. If convicted, the sentence could be anywhere from 10 years to life imprisonment.
