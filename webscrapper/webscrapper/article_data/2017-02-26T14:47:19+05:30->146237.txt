We had earlier reported that   and Metro director,   have joined hands for a new movie. The latest about the film is that   and the director just shot a high-octane, dangerous scene in the middle of the sea. 

 Ashok narrates the experience, 'We shot in   because we didn't want to risk it with the oil spill here. Two fishermen, along with the director and I, went into the sea. The entire scene was shot using a helicam. The fishermen were worried because the waves were strong and I had to jump into the water. I have never tried something like this before, but wanted to give it a shot. I took a dip and gained some confidence. The problem, however, began when I drunk in a lot of salt water. We went for another take and the waves almost smashed my head. The boat also lost control and was about to hit my head. Thankfully, I went into the water and saved myself. People actually thought I would lose my life.' 
 
 Talking about the movie, he adds, 'I am glad the movie is turning out really well. The director is special. I am glad I am doing this as I loved Metro a lot. We haven't decided the actress yet or the title of the film,' he says. Director Ananda Krishnan adds, '  will be doing an important role in the film. We are also in talk with other actors for other character roles.'
