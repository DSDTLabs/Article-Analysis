He said that his role in the film was more of an emotional journey than just a character among the umpteen films he has ventured upon. The film has in fact intertwined the actor with his character  , according to him. 

 He recently too to his social networking page, “From the time I first heard the idea of #TIYAAN , I have time and again spoken about Aslan. Beyond the "ACTION" and "CUT", away from the arc lights and sets, each line that Aslan has said..and each emotion that Aslan has felt stays with me. It may or may not be as personal an experience to you. For many of you who watch #TIYAAN...he might just be another one of my characters..but there is no denying that regardless of where my journey in cinema takes me..one chapter will always read..ASLAN MUHAMMAD. (sic).”
