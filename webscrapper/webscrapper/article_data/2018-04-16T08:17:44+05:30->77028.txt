 A senior official said, “A target to recover 40% of lease money from the defaulters has been given to all zone commissioners. Now as per the Public Demand Recovery Act, the bank account of defaulters can be attached.”
 
 The official also said that deputy commissioners have also prepared a list of commercial units which have not deposited the lease money since allotment. “Notices will be issued to such defaulters and seven days’ time will be given to deposit the lease money. In case they fail, the JDA will cancel the allotment,” he said.
 
 According to sources, the JDA coffers are drying up fast and the recent powers to earn revenue will boost the pace of many important projects like elevated road, Dravyavati river rejuvenation work.
