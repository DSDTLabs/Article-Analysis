Accompanied by Haji Arafat Shaikh, who heads Sena’s minority wing Maharashtra Shiv Va-htuk Sena, Soopariwala met par-ty chief Uddhav Thackeray at Matoshree a couple of days ago and formally joined the party.

 “I was with IUML for over two years, but didn’t see it moving anywhere,” said Soopariwala, a Memon from an affluent family. “After I met Uddhavji, many of my misconceptions about Sena vanished. It is not a communal party and believes in development of every Indian, including Muslims,” he added. Though he denied if he was in the race to get a ticket for the BMC elections, he said Sena might field at least half a dozen Muslim candidates.
 
 “In a democracy, everyone has right to choose his/her political ideology, but we are surprised Sajid chose Sena,” said IUML’s spokesperson (Maharashtra) M A Khalid. —Mohammed Wajihuddin
