Dhanbad: Trouble seems to brewing in   after some of its senior party cadres charged the leadership with partiality in the   for the   civic body polls. 

 Following the alleged rift, star campainers of the party, including Baghmara MLA  , ministers   and  , West Bengal BJP unit president Dilip Ghosh and Dhanbad MP P N Singh among others have an additional job damage control. 
 
 Election in charge of the party, Ganesh Mishra, admitted that a few workers of the party have turned rebel after the distribution of tickets. Mishra, however, added, “The rebellion is not going to have any effect on the election and the Sangh parivar, including VHP, Bajrang Dal and RSS are with us.
 
 The party has fielded Dablu Bauri for the chairman’s position and Jai Prakash for the post of vice-chairman. Unhappy with the party’s decision, BJP activists Janaki Rakha and Sandeep Chatterjee filed nominations for chairman and vice-chairman’s posts. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Chatterjee claimed, “We have been serving the party since beginning when BJP had no identity in this area but when it comes to distribution of tickets, our feedback about the candidates were not taken. It is a fight between loyal workers and corrupt elements within the party. The party has now realized that it is going to face a defeat owing to which the road show of chief minister Raghubar Das scheduled on April 13 has been canceled.”
 
 Senior party leaders deny such a rift within BJP. State president of the newly formed “Mission Modi Again 2019”, Anuranjan Ashok told TOI, “Nothing has come to our notice but if there is a rift, it is not good for our mission. Senior leaders in the state must have taken note of it and appropriate steps would be taken.”
