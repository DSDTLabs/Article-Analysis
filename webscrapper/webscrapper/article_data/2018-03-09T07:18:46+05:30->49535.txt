RANCHI:   and CPI (ML) national general secretary   accused   of supporting the   of Lenin in Tripura and Ramaswamy Periyar in Tamil Nadu. 

 Terming the developments as the beginning of a "dangerous design", Lalu claimed that Modi was encouraging the acts in order to get the path cleared for commissioning his own statues across the country.
 
 "I feel the statues of freedom fighters are being broken at the behest of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi is trying to clear the path for installation of his statues in place of the great leaders across the country. Like in the south, where people put up their statues while they are alive, the PM wants his statues to be installed while he is in power. He is highly proud of himself. He thinks he would not come to power again, so he wants to get this work done," Lalu said on the Ranchi civil court premises, where he was produced in a special CBI court hearing in a fodder scam case. 
 
 In an ongoing post-poll violence in Tripura, two statues of Lenin were razed on Tuesday. Ramaswamy Periyar's statue in Tamil Nadu was also vandalized on Wednesday. 
 
 Bhattacharya, who was in Ranchi to attend a meeting of the party's state unit, accused Modi and the BJP of indulging in vandalism because "the victory in the Assembly elections had got into their heads". 
 
 "They think they have got the license to do anything. Instead of acting against the perpetrators, the PM is expressing his concerns. It appears that the PM has lost control over BJP workers," Bhattacharya said at the CPI (ML)'s state headquarters here. 
 
 Lalu accused the BJP of forging EVMs in Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland to swing Assembly poll results in its favour and demanded re-introduction of ballot papers in future elections.
