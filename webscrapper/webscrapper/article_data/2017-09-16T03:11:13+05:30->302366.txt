GURUGRAM: The Indian National Lok Dal ( ), considered to be one of the main political parties in Haryana, has been unable to attract enough   for the   elections. It had to make do with just 23 candidates after it failed to find suitable candidates for the remaining 12 seats. 

 “It isn’t the case that nobody wants to join us. Because of the time factor, we have decided to contest only on 23 seats this time. Last time too we had contested only on 33 of the 35 seats. This year, we received applications from several people who wanted to contest from the remaining 12 wards, but didn’t find them suitable,” said INLD Gurgaon chief  .
 
 But former INLD workers claimed that the party was unable to convince people to join them. “Forget about new ones joining, the party is facing an exodus because of leaders like Gopi Chand Gehlot, who do not believe in inner party democracy. INLD is like a sinking ship and it is very clear that the party unable to find candidates to contest the election. It is because of Gehlot that even I left the party,” said former councillor from INLD Sunita Kataria, who is contesting the election as an independent candidate.
 
 She also alleged that in some wards, INLD has purposefully not fielded a candidate in order to benefit BJP. “In Ward 8,   has given ticket to Krishna Kataria who is the sister-in-law of Shamsher Katariya. She is an office-bearer of INLD. For this reason, INLD has decided not to field any party candidate on that seat so that the votes do not get divided,” she said.
 
 However, the BJP denied of any such understanding between the two parties. “It is for the INLD to decide on how many seats it wants to contest. It is not our problem if they are unable to get candidates who can contest,” said a senior BJP leader. 
 
 On Friday, 76 candidates withdrew their nomination leaving 202 candidates in the poll fight.
