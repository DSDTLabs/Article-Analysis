SURAT: It was a major embarrassment for Union minister for   Piyush Goyal during his maiden visit to Surat railway station on Friday when the escalator at platform number 4 stopped midway during inspection. 

 Sources said Goyal arrived at Surat airport from New Delhi on Friday morning and drove straight to Surat railway station. Goyal’s visit at Surat was part of the event at Vadodara for flagging off Mahamana Superfast Express between Vadodara and Varanasi through video conferencing by Prime Minister  . 
 
 Goyal, who was accompanied by Navsari MP CR Paatil and divisional railway manager (DRM), Western Railway (WR), Mukul Jain went to platform number 4 at the railway station. Goyal, top railway officials, politicians, media persons,   (RPF) personnel took the escalator to reach the platform. 
 
 In just a few seconds, the escalator stopped midway. Seemingly angry, Goyal took the DRM to task asking how come the escalator had stopped midway? To this, the DRM replied that the escalator may have stopped due to overloading of people. However, Goyal pointed out that the escalators are meant to take hundreds of people. Goyal and all others walked on the escalator to reach the platform. 
 
 On a day prior to the visit, the railway station was all spruced up. All the platforms were cleaned, the railway tracks were cleared of all the litter and filth. 
 
 On the other hand, Goyal spent around 30 minutes at the railway station in a chamber with some railway officials and Paatil to discuss about the world class railway station project. 
 
 “We were not allowed to meet the minister at the railway station. The discussion about the world class railway station could take place in Delhi as well. It was important for the minister to listen to the demands of the passengers,” member of passenger service committee ( ), ministry of railways, Rakesh Shah said.
