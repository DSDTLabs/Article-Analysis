NEW DELHI: An Aam Aadmi Party delegation will meet members of the SC-appointed monitoring committee on Tuesday to register their protest against the sealing drive. "If we do not find a solution, we will call upon Union urban development minister   and home minister Rajnath Singh, and also approach the PM and the President to stop the sealing drive,"   said at a press conference on Monday. 

 "After local shops, now local shopping centres have been brought under the ambit of sealing. There are 143 local shopping centres in the city. Over the years, commercialisation has increased in these markets. Now, suddenly, they have been brought under the sealing ambit, citing building plan violations. The civic bodies have collected conversion charges from most of these. Then, how are they illegal?" asked Bharti. The party alleged thatBJP was "blind" to the plight of traders. "BJP is ruling the civic bodies for a long time. It is responsible for illegal construction that took place during these years," an   leader said. 
 
 AAP has repeatedly said that a Central ordinance was needed to find a lasting solution to the problem. Chief minister   had even threatened to go on an indefinite strike if the sealings weren't stopped.
