Rekha Rana’s acknowledged film, 'Yahan Ameena Bikti Hai' missed being nominated for the Oscars this year by a whisker. It was Cameroon’s official entry, but couldn’t make it to the top-five slot in the Best Film in a Foreign Language category. Rekha is the only Indian artiste with two films sent to the Oscars. 'Tara — The Journey of Love & Passion' was the other entry, sent to the 87th Academy Awards from Togo, West Africa.  'Yahan Ameena Bikti Hai', co-produced by MD4 Productions from Cameroon, will release in India at the end of the year. She collaborated on both her projects with producer-director Kumar Raj.  Meanwhile, Rekha’s music video with rapper Stanley Enow from Cameroon recently released in Africa, and is titled 'Pray For Me', in which she flaunts her Indian dance moves in a desi avatar. Last year, she was seen with Stanley and AKA from South Africa in a music video titled Bounce, which topped the African charts for five months.  Rekha will be seen in a Hollywood TV series produced by ASEG Entertainment and Paul Maucha. Back home, she has a couple of Bollywood offers, which is not surprising since she’s trained at New York Film Academy in Los Angeles and her performances so far have all been appreciated.
