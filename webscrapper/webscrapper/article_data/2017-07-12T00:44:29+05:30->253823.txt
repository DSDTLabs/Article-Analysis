Thane: A 24-year-old youth was arrested on Monday charges of   bullying a   girl by sending her obscene videos and trying to befriend her by opening a fake social media account claiming to be a girl.

 Police said Prashant Tak, a resident of Indira Nagar, Mulund, had created a fake account and identified himself as Khushi. “Sometime last week, the minor received a friend request from Tak who identified himself as a girl named Khushi. She accepted the request and soon the two started chatting and exchanged numbers.
 
 Tak forwarded some obscene videos as Khushi and claimed that his parents had seen their chats and were upset about it. He said a friend, Prashant Tak, would help them. When the minor met Tak she realised that she had been talking to him,” said Shulbha Patil, senior inspector from Shree Nagar police station.
 
 Tak was infatuated with the minor and wanted to befriend her,” added Patil.
