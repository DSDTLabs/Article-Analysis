NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Tuesday decided to bring in the   to trace JNU student  , missing for nearly 200 days, asking   to hand over investigation with immediate effect. A bench of Justices G S Sistani and   transferred the matter to the CBI on a plea by the student’s mother seeking an independent investigation, after the Delhi Police agreed.   said the probe by the CBI would be supervised by an officer of the rank of DIG or above.

 While transferring the matter, the court noted that the Delhi Police had implemented all directions and suggestions given by the court. The matter will be taken up next on July 17. The student had gone missing a day after an altercation with some ABVP students on the night of October 14, 2016.
 
 Last week, HC had rapped the police over the manner of its probe into the disappearance of Ahmad, saying it appeared to be looking for an “escape route” and was “beating around the bush”.
 
 The court had said the conduct of the police showed it was trying to sensationalise the matter or looking for a way out as it was filing reports in sealed covers but “there was nothing confidential, damaging or crucial” in them. It was referring to the forensic analysis reports of the missing student’s laptop and call records that the police had filed in a sealed cover but had initially not even shared with its own lawyer.
 
 HC had also lashed out at the police saying it has been “beating around the bush and not in the bush” as it has been sending people across the country and setting up special investigating teams (SITs), but the nine students suspected to be behind Najeeb’s disappearance were neither questioned, nor were they taken into custody. HC’s direction came on a plea filed by Najeeb’s mother, Fatima Nafees.
