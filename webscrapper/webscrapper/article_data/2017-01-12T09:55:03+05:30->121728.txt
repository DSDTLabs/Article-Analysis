NEW DELHI: Low cost carrier (LCC)   is planning to induct the wide body dreamliner into its fleet and operate long haul budget flights to the west. It may place an ‘optional’ order for the Boeing 787, used by   for nonstop flights to Europe, Japan and Australia, along with a firm order for a large number of single aisle Boeing 737 Max.

 It may soon start long haul flights, on which food and beverages will need to be purchased, and become the first Indian budget carrier to do so. While IndiGo, SpiceJet and a number of foreign budget carriers operate international flights to and from India on single aisle planes, at present Singapore Airline’s (SIA) group LCC Scoot in the only one to fly a twin aisle to the country.
 
 SpiceJet is looking at first leasing a Dreamliner and see how long haul budget flights do before converting its optional orders for the plane into firm ones. The LCC, which has got a new lease of life after its co-founder and BJP strongman Ajay Singh re-acquired the airline two years back, had ordered 42 Boeing 737 in 2014 under its previous promoters. Ajay Singh, who coined “ab ki baar Modi sarkaar”, is learnt to be eying an order of at least 92 aircraft.
 
 Asked to comment on its wide body plans, a SpiceJet spokesman said: “We will consider all options which we think will benefit our customers.” If SpiceJet experiment works, other Indian LCCs may also join the long haul fray.
