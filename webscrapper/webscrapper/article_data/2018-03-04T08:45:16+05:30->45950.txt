HYDERABAD: The   (JFC) constituted by the   (JSP) came up with some recommendations on Saturday, including reiterating the demand for special category status for AP. The JFC was set up by   president  . 

 The committee said despite the then PM  's assurance and the subsequent cabinet decision, the Centre went back on its promises. The committee said AP had agreed to the suggestion made by the Union finance minister in 2016, to accept a special package of assistance worth 16,447 crore. "A mere grant of 16,447 crores towards centrally sponsored schemes is not a substitute to special category status," the committee said. The JFC also said a majority of the promises made to   have not been realised. It suggested Centre to prepare a roadmap on the issues.
