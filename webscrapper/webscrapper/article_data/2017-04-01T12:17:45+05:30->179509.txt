Fans of actor   have been waiting for almost seven months for  , as the star's last release was Welcome to Central Jail in September 2016. The movie, which is directed by Dr Love fame Biju Arookutty, had raised expectations among fans with the actor handling Thrissur accent in the movie and once again playing an indolent youth who is comfortable lazing around his buddies rather than take up a job. 

 
 
 The first half though is a let down even for the hardcore fans. The movie, which is 2 hours and 35 mins, has a slow and sloppy first half with no quality humour to boast about. Dileep plays George, a wayward son of a church priest, enacted by Renji Panicker. 
 
 The director devotes the entire initial half to how George and three best friends operate in Thrissur,  , who plays the female protagonist in the movie, plays an aspiring nun and is quite different from her Anuraga Karikkin Vellam avatar. However, the actress has nothing much to do in the film - apart from staying sober and be miffed with George at times.
 
 The first half also hardly has any sequences of good comedy, which is the staple of Dileep entertainers. The interval bang hints that things might get a bit serious in the latter half. The songs too are mediocre.
