VISAKHAPATNAM: Power supply was seriously affected in the city on Thursday, leaving denizens fretting and fuming. With the merucry setting a scorching pace, the plight of residents was nothing less than sitting on a hot furnace even inside the homes. Eastern discom officials blamed the interruptions in power supply to a technical snag.

 PVV  , chief general manager (operations), APEPDCL, said power supply was disrrupted as the 220 kV Gangavaram conductor line was cut off from the 220 kV   switching station. There was also some technical problem between upper Sileru and Pendurthi line. 
 
 “The APTransco authorities are continuously working at the spot for quick restoration of power supply. It is not the fault of power shortage or some other glitch. It was a technical failure in the supply,” Satyanarayana explained.
 
 P Srikanth, a resident of Sivajipalem, complained that there was no power from 9 am till 4 pm in their area. “Though they restored power at 2 pm, there were at least five interruptions and full supply was restored only at 4 pm,” he said.
 
 The discom earlier imposed an emergency load relief (ELR) at Garividi and Tekkali feeders in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts due to deficit in supply by Transco. Satyanarayana said that consumers may contact toll-free no 1912 for redressal of their grievances. Due to the temporary power interruption, supply timings to agricultural pumpsets in APEPDCL jurisdiction have been changed.
