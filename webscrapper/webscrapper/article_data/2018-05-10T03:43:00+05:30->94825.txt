Panaji: Every month, nearly eight marine species wash up on Goa’s beaches, dead and decomposed. Five turtles and one or two hump-backed dolphins wash up every month while a porpoise is seen every two months. The figures appear worrisome. A total of 52, mainly Olive Ridley turtles were reported dead during the last 11 months since May 2017, 20 hump-backed dolphins and seven porpoises, as the coastal environment is turning increasingly hostile to the marine species. Seven sea turtles washing up on just two days, March 28 and 29, and 12 carcasses on three days — from May 5 to 7 — have been the highest number of dead marine species in a short period. “Some carcasses were highly decomposed, the marine species may have died long ago,” says founder, Terra Conscious, Puja Mitra. The marine conservation agency is collecting data on marine stranding on Goa’s beaches in a collaborative initiative ‘Ocean Watch’ with forest department and Drishti Marine. Wildlife activists are saddened by the routine stranding of marine species. A Baleen whale surfaced at Mandrem beach in a highly decomposed condition. “One unidentified cetacean, either a whale, dolphin or porpoise floated back into the sea,” a network member said. But despite the high figures of stranding of marine species, the network members are cautious about stating that the mortality has increased. “We have no baseline data to compare with and it is too premature to make any conclusions now,” says Mitra. A clearer pattern is likely to emerge after a couple of years of monitoring the pattern and frequency, an official from the forest department said. Setting up a marine mammal stranding response network and better infrastructure for postmortems is the need of the hour. But monitoring has to continue. “After two to three years, we will start seeing patterns in mortality clusters emerging,” Mitra said.
