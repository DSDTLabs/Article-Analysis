GURUGRAM: The city’s sole   broke down, first on Saturday then on Sunday, due to technical glitches. Despite soaring pollution levels in Gurugram, the city is dependent on only one stationary machine to monitor its air quality.

 “The machine suddenly stopped working after the dust storms. The exact problem, however, could not be ascertained. Also, it’s not the first time the machine stopped functioning. We definitely need at least one more such machine to give a clearer picture of air pollution in the city,” said a   (HSPCB) official.
 
 Talking about major challenges, the HSPCB official said, “We are yet to find a plot to install the new machine. We need at least 1,000 sq yds of land to install a new machine and mark a no-disturbance zone around it. We’ve been inviting the corporate sector to donate some land in areas like Cyber City or   to install another air monitoring machine.”
 
 In the absence of accurate pollution data, asthmatic patients like   (43) have to restrict their movement. “I don’t know about other people, but I’m solely reliant on city air quality date for my outdoor movement. Many a time, this pollution data is not available online. I’m not sure about the exact cause, but it makes it a little difficult for me,” he said.
 
 “While Delhi has 12 air quality monitoring machines, Gurgaon has only one. Not only does it restrict our movement, it also often gives inaccurate data. A stationary machine gives pollution data with some accuracy for a radius of only 5km around it,” said Vivek Kamboj, a city-based environmentalist.
 
 The system was installed in 2014 at a cost of over Rs 1.5 crore.
