BENGALURU: The latest political stand- off between the   and   over the recent communal violence in the coastal belt took an unpleasant turn with the BJP accusing chief minister Siddaramaiah of caste-based discrimination of deaths.

 Addressing BJP’s Other Backward Classes (OBC) Morcha, party’s   morcha president K S Eshwarappa said chief minister Siddaramaiah visited the family of  ,who succumbed to injuries after being attacked in retaliation to the murder of Hindu activist Deepak  . 
 
 Last week, the CM visited the homes of Basheer and Rao, before announcing a compensation of Rs 10 lakh. “Siddaramaiah decided to visit the families of Basheer and Rao only after a Muslim was killed. Until then, five OBC people, including   and Santhosh Poojary, were killed, but the CM did not deem it fit to visit their families. This shows he’s trying to politicize the issue for mileage,” Eshwarappa charged. He also condemned Siddaramaiah for calling RSS/Bajrang Dal terror organizations. “I demand an unqualified and unconditional apology from Siddaramaiah,” he added.
 
 Earlier, after inaugurating the meet, national president of the BJP OBC Morcha,   Chauhan, said Siddaramaiah is anti-backward classes as his party is opposed to the bill to provide constitutional status to the national BC Commission. tnn
