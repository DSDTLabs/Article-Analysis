VIJAYAWADA: With reports of water leakages surfacing and recent diarrhoea deaths in Guntur city, denizens are worried over drinking water contamination in city.

 Water is stagnating on majority of the city side-drains ever since stormwater drain (SWD) works were taken up. A few water lines are filled with waste-water. Main water line valves on   in   near   have developed a number of water leakages. The sump consisting of main valves of the water line is submerged underwater and has rusted.
 
 “It is almost 20 days that officials of Vijayawada Municipal Corporation removed caps of the sump as part of stormwater drainage project. There is huge   from the sump. Further, the water gets polluted. It has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes,” said K Raja Kumar, a resident of Srinagar Colony.
 
 Locals are worried over water stagnating in main lines. K  , a local resident, has urged VMC to take necessary measures considering the diarrhoea deaths in Guntur. “Storm water works have spoiled the colony roads. Water lines in the colony are damaged while contract agencies are destroying ramps and old side drains and no official is coming forward to repair them. Officials should take responsibility and take necessary measures to prevent contamination of water,” she added.
 
 Drain water flowing onto the service road beside the national highway is shows the poor sanitation infrastructure in the city and no one from the civic body is responding on this, she added.
 
 Officials of engineering wing of VMC say that they are responding to complaints relating to water leakages and contamination considering the growing fears among the people.
