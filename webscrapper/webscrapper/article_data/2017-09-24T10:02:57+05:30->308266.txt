CHANDIGARH: Sangrur district food and supply officer (DFSO)  , who, on Wednesday, committed suicide by jumping into a canal in Patiala, was under investigation in the case of 34,038 paddy bags worth Rs 2.55 crore going missing from Sardar Rice Mill at   under   sub-division.

 Condoling the death, a   vigilance bureau spokesperson said the vigilance bureau will probe the embezzlement in an impartial manner. On the basis of the investigation, the economic offences wing of the vigilance bureau asked Sangrur district food and supply controller (DFSC)   to come to its Chandigarh office on September 13 alongwith records. 
 
 Manjit told vigilance that paddy was allotted on the recommendations of Gill, assistant food supply officer Harpreet Singh and inspector, food and civil supplies Gurinder Singh Rana, posted in Malerkotla.
 
 Later, in his statement to vigilance, Gill said Sardar rice mill was transferred to Harjit Singh of Khanna through an ownership deed by its owner Darshan Singh and others on October 8, 2016. He also said PUNSUP officers recommended to the state to allot two tonnes (MT) paddy to the mill during the last paddy season, despite having a shelling capacity of only 1.5 tonnes.
 
 Even as investigation into the misappropriation of paddy was still going on, Gill committed suicide. In his suicide note, he held four persons responsible for him taking the extreme step. They include Harjit Singh, Happy Sharma, Manjit Singh and Surinderpal. The Vigilance spokesperson said Gill, in his suicide note, wrote about feeling bad at being examined by the Vigilance Bureau.
