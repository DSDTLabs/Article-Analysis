  .

 Governor NN Vohra was scheduled to address the joint sitting but was interrupted by members of the opposition parties, who stood up shouting slogans against the PDP-BJP government for the continued unrest in the state. When order could not be restored, the governor left after hastily wrapping up his speech.
 
 "The National Conference ( ) and the   created a ruckus in the J&K assembly even when the national anthem was (being) played; even the governor walked away. This is a grave insult," BJP MLA Ravinder Raina said.
 
 He added that the NC, the Congress and the governor should apologise for insulting the national anthem.
 
 The J&K assembly's   promises to be a stormy one, with the opposition making clear its intention to corner the government on the law and order situation and the months-long unrest in the Valley.
 
 "Congress would play the role of vibrant opposition in both the Houses and make the government accountable on all commitments made by the two coalitions partners, as well as its total failures on almost all fronts," J&K Congress chief Ghulam Ahmed Mir said yesterday.
 
 "As the opposition, we have every right to ask questions to the government and seek answers on behalf of the people", he added.
 
 However, PDP minister Naeem Akhtar said that shouting slogans is not productive. 
 
 "Maybe the Opposition believes that shouting slogans in assembly is the only argument they are left with," Akhtar remarked after the disruption of today's session.
