Tamil Nadu Government is all set to unveil the   constructed for Nadigar Thilagam   (at a cost of Rs 2.80 crore) on October 1 to commemorate the birth anniversary of the legendary actor. Chief Minister   had issued an order on unveiling the memorial recently. Now we hear that Information and Publicity Minister   will unveil the memorial, while fisheries minister D Jayakumar will preside over the function.

 Sivaji’s son, veteran actor Prabhu, disappointed by the fact that the Chief Minister was not attending the event, sent a letter to Sellur K Raju requesting the Chief Minister and all the ministers, MLAs and MPs to attend the opening ceremony of the legend. This is what Prabhu had said in his letter, "To Respected Minister of I&B .Tamilnadu
 
 Honourable Minister Sir, Appa's memorial was the dream project of Puratchi Thalaivi Amma Jayalalithaa. If she was alive, she would have presided over the ceremony and done justice to our legendary father Nadigar Thilagam's athma. We are happy that the TN government is unveiling the memorial of our father Sivaji Ganesan, but, at the same time, we are disappointed that our CM or Deputy CM are not attending the opening. He has done so much for Tamil culture and the Tamil language through his films. We request the CM and deputy CM to attend the event.”
