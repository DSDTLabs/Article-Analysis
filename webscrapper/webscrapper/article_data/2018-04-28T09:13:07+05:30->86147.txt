People living in the developing areas on the fringes of the city continue to complain about inadequate water supply.

 There’s an acute shortage of water in NIBM annexe, Siddharthnagar, Mohammedwadi, Undri,   road, Pisoli, Handewadi road, Autadewadi and Holkarwadi for years together, activist Tanaji Lonkar said.
 
 
 “Their lifeline continues to be water tankers. Parvati water works is supplying water to Barkri hills. From there, water is supplied to various parts of  . We want the supply to improve. A new tank constructed on Bakri hills should be made operational and the dispute between PMC and Army authorities over the issue of laying pipeline on defence land should be resolved at the earliest,” Lonkar said.
 
  said, “Meethanagar and   in   are the worst affected area, as the residents get water for 40 minutes only in a day. After the issued was raised at the general body meeting, we are receiving water for 2 hours. But the pressure is very low. Neighbouring areas such as Kondhwa gaothan, Bibvewadi and Padmavati are receiving sufficient water. PMC has started the construction work of two overhead tanks at Shivnerinagar. We hope the water problems will be resolved.”
 
 Mahesh Kadam, president of NGO  , said, “We have properties of over 1,000 acres in Katraj and its suburbs. But the land is lying barren because there is no scope for farming in the absence of water. There is no scope for developing properties because of the biodiversity park reservations. We depend on bore wells and tankers.”
 
 He added, “We preserved water flowing from the hills into a stream around six months ago. But the water cannot be used for drinking. We are told to plant trees even asthere is no water. We have requested the authorities to prepare a scheme like villages in Purandhar. But nothing has happened till date.”
