UNNAO: BJP   Kuldeep   on Wednesday remained missing from the scene in   even as the SIT constituted to probe the rape charge levelled against him visited the survivor’s family in   village.

 The SIT was asked by chief minister   to submit its first report on Wednesday evening. The team confirmed to TOI that Sengar’s statement has not been recorded yet.
 
 While a bevy of SUVs stood outside Sengar’s home, the men guarding his house said that he was away in his Bangarmau assembly constituency.
 
 Sengar’s men also shared a two-page detailed note by him that accused the survivor’s deceased father and uncle of defaming him through a signature campaign on social media and elsewhere.
 
 “The survivor’s uncle and I have faced bitter rivalry for years. This was reflected in the tension during village panchayat elections as well. While her uncle faces 13 cases between 1996 and 2017, her father faces 29 cases. The two ran a campaign against me to defame me,” the statement reads.
 
 It further said that while an abduction case was registered by the girl’s family against five people in June last year, the police removed the names of two people, which made the girl’s family believe that Sengar was behind it.
 
 Talking to TOI, the survivor’s sister, however, accused the MLA of twin ploys — sending his wife to Lucknow and releasing a written statement to disallow SIT from questioning him.
 
 This, even as the SIT went on to record the statements of the rape survivor, her mother, the six cops posted at Makhi police station, jail staff and doctors at Unnao district hospital, apart from the doctors who performed the post mortem examination.
 
 When the SIT team reached the MLA’s residence in Makhi village, they were stopped by the BJP legislator’s supporters, who demanded that the police conduct a fair probe.
