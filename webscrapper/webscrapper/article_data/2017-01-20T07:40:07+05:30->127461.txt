 The police spokesman said a case of theft had been registered and the police are investigating the case.
 
 As per reports, an SUV was allotted to BDO Gosainganj Bhola Nath Kanaujia. His driver Rajesh Srivastava told the police that he took Kanaujia to Kanshiram Memorial in Aashiana, where the latter had to visit a voter registration centre as part of his election dutyy.
 
 The duo left for Kanaujia's house in Aashiana at 3pm.
