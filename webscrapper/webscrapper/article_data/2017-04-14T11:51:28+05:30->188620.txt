NAGPUR: Animals at  , managed by   (PDKV), remained confined to their cages and were not released for display as temporary workers managing the zoo went on indefinite strike from Thursday.

 The temporary workers are on strike as they are not getting minimum wage. “We are paid Rs90 per day only for risking our lives by managing leopard and tiger cages,” said a section of them.
 
 On Thursday, zoo in-charge Dr SS Bawaskar and livestock supervisor   were the only two permanent employees present at the zoo scrambling to manage the affairs.
 
 Animals, especially, tigers, sloth bear and leopards, were locked inside since Wednesday evening. There were also no zookeepers to clean the filthy cages with scat littered everywhere.
 
 There were also no workers to handle visitors. “Finally, we had to close entry for visitors around 3pm,” said Dr Bawaskar. The zoo controller ND Parlewar tried to overcome the situation by deputing three workers, who refused to enter wild animal cages as they were not trained to the job and returned.
 
 Acting PDKV vice-chancellor VM Bhale said, “The issue is being blown out of proportion by the staff. The nuisance is being created actually to protest the transfer of Dr Abhijeet Motghare, who worked as a veterinarian in the zoo.”
 
 “We are ready to hold talks with the workers on the issue of minimum wages but animals should not suffer at any cost. Dr Bawaskar is using these workers as a front to revoke Dr Motghare’s transfer,” Bhale added.
 
 Meanwhile, Sanjay Thakre, member-secretary of Maharashtra State Zoo Authority (MSZA), visited the zoo on Thursday and reviewed the situation. Thakre said, “We did a reality check, but found that animals are being taken care of. We have written to the PDKV to make alternative arrangement.”
