Barnala: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal reiterated that the   and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were behind the acts of sacrilege in Punjab in 2015. 

 Addressing political meetings in Barnala, Mehal Kalan and Bhucho assemblt constituencies in Bathinda, Sukhbir said the Congress and the Gandhi family committed “the biggest act of sacrilege ever against the Sikh community” by attacking the Golden Temple with tanks and artillery as part of Operation Bluestar in 1984. “The same party is responsible for the massacre of innocent Sikhs in Delhi. We can never forgive this party and the Gandhi family,” he said.
 
 He went on to take on AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal, claiming that he was responsible for bulldozing a historic piau at Sisganj Gurdwara in Delhi and the incidents of sacrilege in Punjab were also traced to AAP. “AAP leaders openly disrespected the Sri Guru Granth Sahib by comparing it with their election manifesto. Even the sacrilege of the holy Quran was traced to an AAP MLA of Delhi,” he said. 
 
 Badal claimed that Kejriwal had now entered into a conspiracy with radicals who wanted to spoil the peace and communal harmony of Punjab. 
 
 Punjab state planning board vice-chairman Rajinder Gupta asked people to vote for development, saying that the state has seen rapid development in 10 years. He said Barnala area got huge sums of money for development purposes under the present regime.
