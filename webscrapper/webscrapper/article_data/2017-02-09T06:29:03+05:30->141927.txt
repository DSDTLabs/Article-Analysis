AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Wednesday sought a reply from the Surat police commissioner in response to a petition filed by a poker club after it was denied clearance by Surat police on the grounds that poker is gambling and not a game of skill. Petitioner AAA Gaming Pvt Ltd, through its advocate Maulin Pandya, submitted before the court that it had made a representation before the police commissioner on January 17 seeking permission to start a poker club in Umra area of the city. Ten days later, the commissioner denied permission saying “poker is a game of chance and not skill which allows gambling in game”.

 After Justice   recused from this case, Justice C L Soni heard the matter and sought a reply from the commissioner as well as the local police inspector. Further hearing has been posted for February 21. The petitioner said the view expressed by the authority is without legal base, and there was no detailed explanation on how the commissioner reached the conclusion. It further said that section 13 of Gujarat Prevention of Gambling Act exempts games of skill from it s purview.
 
 Last year, similar petitions were filed by the   and   in Ahmedabad when local police asked them to stop the game of poker.
