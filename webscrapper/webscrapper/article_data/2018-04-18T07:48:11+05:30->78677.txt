PATNA: The Patna high court on Tuesday will pronounce its judgement on April 23 over the joint admission board (JAB) decision to conduct JEE (Advance) on May 20 only through online mode.

 JAB conducts the online examination for admission in all IITs, NITs and other engineering colleges across the country. The JAB’s decision was challenged by Narendra Prasad and  , pleading that the entrance examination only through online mode favours those familiar with computer use and would deprive the candidates from rural background of their chance to qualify.
 
 The bench of Justice   had asked the JAB to furnish segregated data of students who appeared in and qualified the JEE (Main) through online and offline modes in 2016 and 2017. The court had also sought the Centre’s reply if it had given its consent to JAB for conducting examination only through online mode.
 
 Union of India’s additional solicitor general S D Sanjay said the court on Tuesday was apprised of a Supreme Court’s judgment, refusing to interfere with the policy decision of central government to conduct online examination for admission in medical colleges for MBBS course across the country.
 
 JAB’s counsel YV   said in 2017, the   had summoned JAB to know what steps were taken to check the use of unfair means in nationwide competitive examination. “JAB then had submitted that they were shifting to online mode for conducting examinations and the apex court had given its nod,” Giri said.
