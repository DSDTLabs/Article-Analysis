 Reports claimed that IOA president N Ramachandran had written to the ministry and claimed that there was no resolution passed to honour Kalmadi and Chautala.However, when contacted, Ramachandran told TOI that what had appeared in the media was just a draft which had not been signed by him and that he would release the letter only on Wednesday .
 
 “Some senior IOA officials had met on Sunday to take a decision and we formally wrote a letter to the ministry . The contents of the letter will be made public on Wednesday,“ Ramachandran said. When asked about what had appeared in the media on Tuesday, the IOA president said that it was definitely not the final draft. It could not be ascertained how did the draft come into the public domain a day before it was to be officially submitted.
 
 While the final draft will be released on Wednesday only, sports minister Vijay Goel reacted favourably to the news, strongly indicating that the suspension his ministry slapped over IOA in the wake of the Kalmadi-Chautala decision, would be lifted.
 
 “I am happy that IOA has reversed its decision which augurs well for governance of sports in the country,“ Goel said in a statement on Tuesday .
 
 Going back to the controversial move, Ramchandran said, “At the fag end of the AGM held in Chennai on Dec 27, 2016, someone in the House had proposed the names of Kalmadi and Chautala as nominations for life presidents. Our objective is to resolve this matter at the earliest and amicably with the ministry . A lot of drama has happened since then and I just want it to be over.“
