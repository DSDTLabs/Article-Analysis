Ludhiana: A joint meeting of the left parties — including Communist Party of India (CPI), CPI-Marxist (CPI-M), Revolutionary Marxist Party of India (RMPI), and Marxist Communist Party of India-United (MCPI-U) — was held on Tuesday in the presence of several senior leaders. Some prominent leaders present in the meeting included DP Maur, Gurnam Gill, Ramesh Rattan, Sukhwinder Singh Lotey, Raghbir Benipal, Amarjit Singh Sehjaad, Kuldeep Singh, and Tarsem Jodhan, among others.

 Giving more information DP Maur said: “We are demanding free and fair elections of the municipal corporation, Ludhiana, therefore central forces should be deployed in Ludhiana until the results of the elections are announced. This has become very important in the wake of attack on Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers and leaders by organized goons of the ruling Congress party in Model Town Extension, Shimlapuri, and Haibowal. He also added: “Central forces are also important, as the state police was working on the directions of the ruling party in a biased manner. There is serious apprehension that as the election date approaches, more such incidents may happen. It is a shame that despite the fact that the LIP MLA was attacked in the house of a supporter, no FIR has been lodged against the accused so far.”
 
 During the meeting, the leaders also decided to launch a joint campaign for candidates of all left parties, including Randhir Singh Dhira (CPI) from Ward No.78, Sanjay Kumar (CPI) from Ward No.94, Ajit Chaurasia (CPI) from Ward No.95, Kulwant Kaur from Ward No.7 (independent), Rajwinder Kaur from Ward No.22 (independent), Gurjit Singh Kala from Ward No.70 (independent), Geeta from Ward No.23 (independent), and Durga Wati from Ward No.29 (independent).
