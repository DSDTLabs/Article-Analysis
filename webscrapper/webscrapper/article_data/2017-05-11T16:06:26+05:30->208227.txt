Director   is all set to begin shooting forthe upcoming reality show   Season 8 and he is looking forward to seeing wrestler   perform stunts.
 
  At the launch event of Khatron Ke Khiladi Season 8, Golmaal director   said that his role on the show goes beyond that of a host this time. He also revealed that he’s involved in every aspect, right from the planning stage.
  
  Also, there is an emotional attachment because in the time lag before Khatron Ke Khiladi show re-launched.
  
  "We worked on everything, from the stunts to the humour. I am busy this year too but I had to do it. I’m personally associated with the stunts and that works for me as well as the show in a big way. If you are not involved in the stunts, then it’s just another show where you give your comments and sit quietly," he reasons, saying he is looking forward to making wrestler Geeta Phogat do stunts.
  
  He added, "I haven’t interacted with any of the contestants yet. I want them to be surprised with what we have planned in Spain."
  
  
 
  
  Rohit also said that while filming for his upcoming movie 'Golmaal Again' in Hyderabad and Goa he was also brainstorming on his upcoming reality show, which he is hosting in its eighth season.
  
  "I’m shooting Golmaal Again till May 17 and the following morning I’m taking off to Spain for KKK. Once I’m back in July, I’ll resume shooting for the film for another 10-15 days. We have to be ready for a Diwali release," he says.
  
  For now Rohit is excited about taking over from Arjun Kapoor, who hosted KKK last season, and insists that this did not create any bad blood between the two.
