 When Muskan started beating top players of the country, coaches were confident that she would excel. On her getting into the Indian team despite being a Sub-junior archer, her coach said: “Her performance has been consistent, which has convinced the selection committee to field her for the national team.” Somewhat similar is the success story of the Yshwi, a junior-level archer. She has never won any medal at the national championship; still she managed to secure her place. “She has maintained regular score and selectors wanted her to give her a chance,” said her coach. Son of a swimming coach from Bhopal, Pritish, has also been a consistent performer at the junior level national circuit, which helped him make the cut.
 
 Congratulating the players Sports minister Yashodhara Raje Scindia said, “Getting into the team despite being sub junior (players) is enough to gauge the level of these archers that MP has produced. I wish them good luck for the championship,” said Scindia.
