GURUGRAM: Most   heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday after the   turned out to be easier than expected. However, there were some who said it wasn’t a cakewalk.

 “It was quite easy. I finished the physics paper within the stipulated time. In fact, I had time to revise. The questions were well within the course,” said Rishab Kaul, a student of Delhi Public School, Sector 45. “I am hoping to get good results. I had checked the paper of previous years and found this year’s to be much easier,” he added.
 
 Most students from other schools echoed Kaul. Anubhav Alawat of Salwan Public School, Sector 15, said the paper wasn’t lengthy, but tested concepts. “All my classmates found the paper easy,” he said.
 
 However, there were some who complained about the nature of questions that had come. “The paper was not that great. It wasn’t entirely bad either, but some questions were application-based. For instance, there was one question about the Chernobyl incident. It turned out to be a GK-type question,” said Khushi Thakkar, a student of DPS, Sushant Lok.
 
 Thakkar also said there were small markers that were confusing and took a lot of time. “It took some time to form the answers for them. Many of my friends too felt it was a bit lengthy as compared to last year’s paper. Some of friends were so confused they couldn’t say how well they wrote the paper,” she said.
 
 However, students said they were happy as they have crossed a “major hurdle” since the subject was always associated with a bit of a fear and anxiety.
 
 “It was a very easy paper,” said SD Sharma, head of physics department at Blue Bells Schools, Sector 4.
