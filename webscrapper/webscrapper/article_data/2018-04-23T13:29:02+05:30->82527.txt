Actor   and   turned parents to   via surrogacy last year. Ever since then, the proud parents have been beaming with joy and enjoying parenthood to the fullest.

 
 Looks like the happy four are all set to add a new member to the family.   and Kashmera are planning to adopt a baby girl.
 
 "We have always wanted a girl," said Kashmera. "Both Krushna and I were really keen on adding a girl member to our family. When our little sons were born, we couldn't control our excitement and I was completely happy taking care of my three boys, my twins and Krushna, " laughs Kashmera.
 
  
  
 
 "But honestly, you know having a little girl is always a bliss. So, now with two little boys, we are keen on a baby girl, too. Infact Krushna and I were discussing this a few months ago since we wanted a girl too. Adoption has always been on our mind even though we have kids today. We don't have a girl yet. Though that's definitely on the cards but not so soon, as currently all my time, energy and focus is divided amongst my little boys."
 
 
 She further said, "Sometime soon, we shall definitely bring a little girl to our family and you never know, I might just get pregnant. God's ways are always unpredictable. Actually not many know that we were going ahead with adoption, if surrogacy wouldn't have worked out for us. But thankfully, it did else we would have adopted one girl and boy or two girls but a girl definitely was on our list and now that we don't have a girl we may adopt soon," said Kashmera.
 
 
 "You know, I am the happiest mother today. My boys are the best thing that have happened to me," says the proud mother.
 
 Krushna and Kashmera have been married for 5 years. The kids will turn one year old in a few weeks time.
