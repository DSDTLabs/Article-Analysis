PALAKKAD: The district, blessed with three  , more than a dozen major dams and the unique rain forests called Silent Valley, is facing one of the  .

 Malampuzha, the biggest irrigation dam of the state, has water for drinking purposes of Palakkad town and six adjoining  . It could not provide irrigation water for the second crop of   in Alathur, Palakkad and parts of Chittur taluk, affecting paddy cultivation in the `rice bowl' of Kerala.
 
 Now,   is pocked with islands and its rock-filled bottom is a haven for grazing cattle. The water level in the Kanjirapuzha, Mangalam and Pothundy dams have gone down drastically . The Walayar dam has completely dried up. Bharatappuzha, the second-biggest river in the state, had almost dried-up by November itself.
 
 The Bhavani and Chalakudy rivers are also getting dried up fast in the unprecedented drought situation because of the failure of the monsoon for the past two years.
 
 This has prompted the Kerala Water Authority to seek police protection to 15 of its water sources in Chitturpuzha fearing `water war' among the local communities in the wake of unprecedented drought and acute shortage of drinking water.
 
 The district development committee meeting on December 31 had directed the district collector to take stern steps against the misuse of drinking water, considering the shortage.
 
 Meanwhile, MLA K Krishnankutty has demanded that the government should provide free ration to the paddy farmers of Chittur who could not take up the second crop due to the shortage of water. In a letter to agriculture minister VS Sunilkumar on Sunday, Krishnankutty demanded a special package for the droughtaffected farmers of the district.
