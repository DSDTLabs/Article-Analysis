INDORE:While BJP has left no stone unturned to gain political mileage in the case, Congress remains on the back foot. Ruling party representatives were seen at   and   assuring people they were fighting for them.

 While they assured residents would not be charged for the flats, they refrained from making any comments on record.
 
 “We have written to the administration to provide the flats for free. It is up to them to decide,” said  , BJP MLA, Indore.
 
 While initially Congress leaders were seen actively raising their voices against the demolition, no party leader was seen now. Congress has started blaming residents for this.
 
 “We initiated a movement but we did not receive support from the people. We will always stand with them but when we asked them to come and support us, not even 50 of them participated in the agitation,” said  , city president, Indian National Congress.
