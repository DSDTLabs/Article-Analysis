  is now back in India after globe-trotting for the promotions of the film. The actress, who recently revealed that she hadn’t signed any new projects in the West, shared an   post on   for all her followers.

  
  
 The post focuses on the importance of the present and reads, “Your life is right now!” The post also asks one to not hold out for the future, for a new lover, a new house, or even a new job. The message further reiterates that one should enjoy his life right now, because “it’s not ever going to get better than right now.” The update ends with telling us that the way we respond emotionally to our life right now becomes the basis of what is to come further.
