NASHIK: Three college students were seriously injured when the state transport bus they were travelling in turned turtle near Yeola, 84 km from Nashik, on Monday morning. Around 12 other students, the bus driver and the conductor also sustained minor injuries. 

 The Yeola police said the students, aged between 16 and 18 years, were shifted to private and government hospitals for treatment. The bus driver and the conductor were also admitted to a private hospital. 
 
 At around 8.30 am, the state transport bus left from Malkheda, about 15km from Yeola. The bus was moving on the Satali road, which is a single lane narrow road passing through villages. 
 
 Inspector   of the Yeola taluka police station said, “There were some 50 passengers travelling by the bus, of which, about 20 to 22 were college students. They boarded the bus from Malkheda and the villages along the route.” 
 
 The bus driver,  , 23, a resident of Nandgaon, told the police that the vehicle developed some technical snag, following which, he had to immediately apply brakes. Waghmare said over-speeding was out of question as the road was too narrow for driving fast. 
 
 The police have registered a case of negligent driving against the bus driver. 
 
 Officials of the traffic branch of the rural police said they had identified spots prone to accidents in the rural parts of the district and wherever possible, the necessary infrastructure has already been put into place. 
 
 Many rural roads in the district remain single lane and it was entirely up to the drivers to ensure safety. The officials said the proposals for putting up speed breakers, signage, were for the state or national highways.
