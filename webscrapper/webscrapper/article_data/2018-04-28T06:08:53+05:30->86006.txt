KOLKATA: A 74-year-old woman committed suicide at her   home in   on Friday, a day after her 16-year-old grandson   died of electrocution during a family function at a relative’s place in Behala Kadamtala.

 
 Sarala Sardar was found hanging in a room at their Dakshin Gouripur home, around 40kms from the city, on Friday morning, even before Prasenjit’s body could reach their village after a post-mortem examination in Kolkata.
 
 “She had been crying relentlessly since Prasenjit’s death. She had even walked towards the garden early in the morning. We thought of letting her be alone for some time but then in the morning we found her hanging,” said Shyamal Sardar, a relative.
 
 On Thursday, Prasenjit had died of electrocution after he had accidentally touched a pedestal fan while speaking over a cellphone. Initially, people thought he got electrocuted after the charger, connected to the phone, had snapped but later it was found that he was electrocuted from the fan. Prasenjit was taken to a local hospital on   near Kadamtala where he was declared dead.
 
 “The grief was too much for her to bear and possibly that is the reason she ended her life this way,”  , another relative, said.
 
 When TOI visited the house at Bishnupur on Friday afternoon, a pall of gloom had descended on the family. “I don’t feel like living anymore. I lost my son and mother within 24 hours. I don’t know how to cope with this grief,” said Purna Sardar, Prasenjit’s father.
