NEW DELHI: A   was   to death by two of his friends after they had an   over some trivial issue. The incident was reported from southeast Delhi’s Govindpuri when the boy had gone out for a stroll with his friends on Wednesday.

 The victim,  , knew the accused duo since the last few years as all of them lived in the same locality in Navjeewan Camp. His parents told cops that on Wednesday afternoon, Wasim left home to meet a few of his friends and told them that he would be back in a couple of hours.
 
 But when he did not return after five hours, his family members started making frantic calls to him, all of which went unanswered. They even went out looking for him, but he could not be found. In the meanwhile, one of the locals from the area informed his father that he had seen Wasim lying in a pool of blood in one of the parks near their house.
 
 Family members rushed to the park and found multiple stab wounds on his body, soon after which they made a PCR call at 11 pm. The boy was rushed to a nearby private hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.
 
 “He had an altercation over a petty issue with the accused duo after which he was attacked. One of the accused, a juvenile, has been taken in police custody and we are questioning him. The other attacker is still at large and a team has been formed to nab him,” said Romil Baaniya, deputy commissioner of police (southeast).
 
 Police said Wasim’s parents always objected to the bad company he kept, because of which he even left his house last year for two months. He, however, returned after two months. Then too, he didn’t leave the company of his friends.
