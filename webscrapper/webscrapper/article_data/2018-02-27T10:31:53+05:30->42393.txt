KOLKATA: While the number of students failing to achieve the requisite attendance to appear in university examinations is increasing,   is still not in a position to implement the 'Choice-Based Credit System' (CBCS) in humanities and science undergraduate courses. 

 On Monday, pro-VC   could not confirm the probability of CBCS, which allots as many as 10 marks in each subject to students' attendance, being implemented from the next academic session.
 
 Once CBCS is in place,   will have to switch to a semester-wise test system. Also, under the CBCS, colleges can reward 20 marks in each subject to students, out of which 10 will be on subject attendance and the remaining on the students' class performance through the year.
