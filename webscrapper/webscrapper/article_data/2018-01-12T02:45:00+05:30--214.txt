Nagpur: The   will be soon moved to Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), Borivali, in Mumbai. The orders to this affect were issued by principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) AK Misra early this week.

 “There is no point in keeping the animal in a cage, especially when it has been so close to humans. It is a fit case for safari,” said Misra.
 
 The tiger will be moved to SGNP from Gorewada rescue centre, where it has been kept currently. Chief conservator of forest (CCF) of SGNP Anwar Ahmad said, “PCCF’s letter has been received by us on Monday. The procedures to shift the tiger to Borivali rescue centre will begin soon.” 
 
 Ahmad said only after examining the tiger will it be decided if it can be sent to safari area for public view. Currently, the 20 acre safari area in SGNP has seven tigers.
 
 The five-year-old problem tiger had been caged at Gorewada after being dramatically tranquillized and captured from the outskirts of Sitasawangi village in Tumsar forest range on December 23. A state-level expert committee had on January 2 unanimously decided not to release the problem tiger in Bhandara division. The committee decided not to release the tiger after analysing several reports and looking at its behaviour of coming close to human settlements despite good forest cover nearby.
 
 Instead of avoiding humans, the tiger had entered a marriage party and house warming function at Masulkhapa village in Madhya Pradesh bordering Maharashtra, before entering Bhandara division on December 10.
 
 CCF Sudhakar Dole said, “We have received a letter to move the Tumsar tiger and PCCF Misra will be looking into the whole procedure.”
