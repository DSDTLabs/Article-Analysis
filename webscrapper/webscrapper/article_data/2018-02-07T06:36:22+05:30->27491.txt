LUCKNOW: The Yogi Adityanath government on Tuesday appointed a BJP member and a triple talaq victim,  , as a member of the UP Minority Commission.

 Sofiya, who hails from Chennai, was living in Kanpur with her in-laws when she joined the BJP and took active part in the campaigning during the   election. Confessing that she was shocked at Yogi’s appointment as chief minister,   said she had earlier thought that Yogi was a staunch Hindu but her opinion changed after watching his “excellent” performance as CM in the last 10 months. She said her earlier assessment of Yogi was based merely on media reports. Sofia is the second woman party worker to have been promoted by the BJP.
