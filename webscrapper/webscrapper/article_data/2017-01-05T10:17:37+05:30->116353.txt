SURAT: Two years after the buffalo-hit incident at Surat airport, SpiceJet is set to restart flight operations from the city again. 

 In an announcement on its Twitter handle ‘@flyspicejet’ two days ago, the company said, “Surat will fly soon. Stay tuned to this space for official update on new connections”.
 
 A SpiceJet plane carrying 171 passengers was grounded on the runway minutes before take-off, after it hit a buffalo. The buffalo had entered the high-security runway area from breaches in the compound wall and fencing at the airport. Soon after the incident, the airline announced the termination of all its services from Surat. 
 
 According to the social media group ‘We Want Working Airport at Surat’ (WWWAS), who are in constant touch with top authorities of SpiceJet including its CEO  , the airline is considering two direct destinations and a hoping flight from Surat.
 
 For this, the airline submitted an application to restart commercial operations from Surat airport to the   (DGCA).
 
 After Air India, SpiceJet was the second airline to start the flight services from Surat, to Delhi and Mumbai, which began on January 12, 2012. After two successful years of operations, the unfortunate buffalo-hit and the major damage to the aircraft, forced the airline to back terminate its operations here. 
 
 Following the buffalo-hit,   (AAI) and the DGCA, immediately rolled out the infrastructural development plans for the airport worth over Rs 120 crore. The construction of a perimeter wall, clearing of elephant grass and weeds, road lighting and the extension of the runway from 2,250 metres to 2,905 metres was taken up.
 
 “Air India (AI) is operating flights between Surat, Mumbai and Delhi on a regular basis. SpiceJet’s technical team was impressed with the infrastructure development and safety parameters at the airport during their visit a few months ago and they have now officially announced their plans for Surat,” WWWAS member,  , said.
