CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   on Tuesday directed Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) not to disclose the final list of promotion of   (HCS) officers into the   (IAS). The HC, however, made it clear that the UPSC can continue the process of promotion but the final list has to be kept in a sealed cover.

 A division bench headed by justice   passed these orders while disposing of a petition filed by Virender Singh Hooda and others HCS officers. Petitionersâ€™ main plea was that promotion list of HCS officers, sent to UPSC by the state, should not be published till the decision on their appeal regarding fixation of seniority list of   is not decided by the high court.
 
 Elevation of HCS officers to IAS cadre has been pending against vacancies for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. There are around 30 HCS officers who are in the line of promotion.
