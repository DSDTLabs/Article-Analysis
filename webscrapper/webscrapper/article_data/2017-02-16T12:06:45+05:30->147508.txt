PATNA: Bihar government’s employees and judicial officers may lose their job if found consuming liquor or drugs.

 The   government has enforced prohibition in the state since April last year. A state cabinet meet, chaired by CM Kumar, on Wednesday approved an amendment to the Bihar Government Employee Conduct Rules, 1976 and also gave nod to the   Rules, 2017 to include the prohibition-related provisions in them.
 
 Briefing newsmen after the cabinet meet, principal secretary (cabinet secretariat)   said the original employee conduct rules stipulated that no state government employee shall be under the influence of intoxicated drink or drugs when on duty or shall consume it at public places. The amendment states that no state government employee as well as judicial officer shall be under the influence of intoxicated drink or drugs. Violators will face departmental proceeding.
 
 Mehrotra further said Bihar officials are also bound by their native state’s law to abide by prohibition rules in other states where they are in force. That is, they may face departmental proceedings if they are reported to have defied the prohibition laws in states like Nagaland, Kerala and Gujarat. The state cabinet also sanctioned Rs 50 crore out of Rs 500 crore, earmarked as venture capital funds, for start-ups under the CM’s ‘Saat Nischay’ initiative.
 
 The cabinet approved a state building construction department’s proposal to christen the upcoming international convention centre near Gandhi Maidan as ‘Samrat Ashok Convention Centre’.
