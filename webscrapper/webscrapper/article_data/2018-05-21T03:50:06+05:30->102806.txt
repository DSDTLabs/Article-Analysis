MUMBAI: A son who ill-treats and assaults his mother cannot claim the right to enter her house, the Bombay high court has observed. A south Mumbai resident, along with his wife and child (a minor), had approached the court after his 72-year-old-mother changed the locks to her Malabar Hill flat and refused him and his family entry. 

  "Prima facie, the son has no right to his mother's home," said Justice Shahrukh Kathawalla. "He also cannot claim any right of entry on grounds of dispossession, when the mother is seriously troubled over the problems created by him in the house, including committing assault..." 
 
  The elderly woman, a doctor, recently appeared before the judge, saying that for "the last several years, I was suffering mental and physical abuse at the hands of my son". She told the judge her son, under psychiatric treatment for over a decade, had repeatedly assaulted her. She said that when she could not take the abuse any more, she filed a police case and also a complaint under the Protection of Women from   Act, 2005. As a last resort, when her daughter-in-law and her grandson left her flat, along with their maid and their dog, she changed its locks. 
 
 The senior citizen said she stopped living in her flat as she was scared of her son. The judge assured her she won't be harassed by her son anymore and can start living in her home.
 
  "The senior inspector of Malabar Hill police station is directed to render all assistance to the woman, as and when she needs help at any point of time, day or night," the judge ordered.
 
 The woman's deceased husband too was a doctor. Their flat stood in her name. 
 
 The court allowed the son and his wife to retrieve their belongings from the Malabar Hill flat in the presence of the high court's commissioner for taking accounts.
