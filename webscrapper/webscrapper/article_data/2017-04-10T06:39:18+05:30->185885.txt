AMARAVATI: Even as CM   and his family moved into a newly-built swanky bungalow in Hyderabad on Sunday, it is learnt that the TDP supremo is also keen on finding himself a 'suitable land' in   to build a residence. 

 Sources close to the chief minister indicated that scouting for an   -- either on the riverfront or at some other place - has already begun. The TDP national president, who is looking to politically consolidate his position by clinching maximum number seats in the next elections, just 24 months away, has made a decision to have his residence in the capital region ready by then, the sources said.
 
  "The CM expressed his interest to have a permanent residence here in Amaravati. So we are in the process of identifying a land. Once an ideal land is identified, it will be bought," a senior leader of Naidu's camp said.
 
 While the search is still in the preliminary stages, another source pointed out that the master plan has earmarked land for CM's camp office-cum-residence. "There is a provision already, but we are still looking for an ideal plot keeping in view all the requirements. It may take some time," the source added. Till then, Naidu will stay in his residence in  .
 
 As the plot allotment for the farmers of the capital region, who gave their lands under the land pooling scheme (LPS) is ongoing, the decision will be taken once it is done. There is clarity over whether the CM is planning to purchase one or two plots. The maximum area of plots being given away to farmers is 2,000 sq yards.
 
 It may be recalled that Chandrababu rented a riverfront guest house on a sprawling 1.5 acre site in Undavalli. He got it remodelled and moved into it in 2015.
