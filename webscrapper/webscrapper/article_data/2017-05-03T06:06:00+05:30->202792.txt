MUMBAI: Representatives of various parents' groups alleged that education minister   refused to address their problems about illegal fee hikes at schools across the city. The parents said that Tawde instead asked them to just submit a list of errant schools, something the group claims they have done in the past as well. 

   , member of the Parents of   of Maharashtra, a group fighting commercialization of  , along with members of similar groups wanted to meet Tawde and suggest amendments to the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011. 
 
  "Two years back, we submitted a list of 40 schools but no action was taken. The minister is asking us to do the same thing again. He has said that the government will hold hearings with parents from the school and the management. Instead, we instead wanted that he address the problem at a common level instead of trying to speak to individual schools. And this could be done by making the necessary changes in the Act but he refused to meet us over that," she said. Tawde did not respond to TOI's calls or message.
