HYDERABAD: For the third consecutive time, Hyderabad emerged as the Indian city with the best quality of living, according to   of Living rankings 2017. Globally, Vienna walked away with the honour, for the fourth time in a row.

 Mercer, head-quartered in New York, is a global human resources consulting firm.
 
 While Hyderabad maintained its ranking at the national-level, it slipped five not ches below since last year in the overall rankings. Yet, both Hyderabad and Pune stood higher on the charts than the country's more “traditional business centres“, Mumbai and New Delhi, ranked at 154 and 161 respectively.
 
 What worked in favour of Hyderabad, as per the report, is its “relatively lower crime rate, lesser air pollution and improved options for international and reputable English speaking schools“.
 
 Mercer's survey, covering over 230 cities across the globe, is conducted annually to enable multinational companies and other employers compensate its employees fairly, while sending them on international assignments. “In comparison with other metros in the country, Hyderabad offers a cosmopolitan environment and a higher standard of living at more affordable rates. The city's international schools also offer good-quality education at a cost that is only one-third of of what is charged by schools in Mumbai and New Delhi,“ said  , president of   (TEA). While the report applauded Hyderabad's “efficient police force“ and relatively better quality of air, it did indicate that the city fared poorly in civic amenities. The survey also revealed that Hyderabad ranks below major cities like Mumbai, Kolkata and Pune in terms of city infrastructure.
