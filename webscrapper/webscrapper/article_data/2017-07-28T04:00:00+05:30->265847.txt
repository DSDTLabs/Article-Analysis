Surat: Owner of a diamond polishing unit owner was booked by the Varachha police for allegedly cheating traders of Rs 11.90 crore.

 Accused Alpesh Mavani, a resident of Mota Varachha, sold the machinery of his diamond unit before disappearing, police said.
 
 Mavani had purchased rough diamonds from Prakash Shah and other traders for the business between February and March. He made paltry initial payments to them, but later started dilly-dallying. He disappeared after July 13 and despite several attempts, the creditors could not trace him. Ultimately, they lodged the complaint. 
 
 Mavani met complainant Shah, a resident of Athwa Gate, through a common friend and purchased 5,570 carats rough diamonds worth Rs 2.10 crore. Initially, he paid him Rs 20 lakh for the roughs, but then started delaying. Ultimately, he disappeared without paying him the remaning of Rs 1.90 crore.
 
 Similarly, Mavani had purchased rough diamonds from other traders in market and duped them. “We are yet to find out exact number of persons cheated by Mavani. During preliminary investigation, it has come to light that he owes nearly Rs 12 crore to many. We are questioning his family members to trace his location,” police said.
 
 Police suspect that Mavani had no intention of pay them considering he had sold the machinery of his unit before disappearing. Police are yet to find out if he sold the purchased rough diamonds to any other businessman and received payment against them.
