PANAJI: The   on Saturday said that the   specialised in theatrics and excessively dramatic behaviour to win elections and hoodwink the people. Chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s torchlight agitation against off-shore casinos and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise to deposit Rs 15 lakh in bank accounts were incidents that proved that the BJP “was a master of cheap theatrics,” said state Congress spokesperson Yatish Naik.

 Naik was responding to BJP leader and Lok Sabha MP Narendra Sawaikar, who on Friday condemned the Congress and said that the grand old party was resorting to cheap theatrics when it met with Goa governor Mridula Sinha to stake claim to form the government.
 
 “It is the BJP which is a master of cheap theatrics, and cheap theatrics is a super speciality of Parrikar,” Naik said. “When   was in the opposition, he wore a t-shirt that said ‘English Why? Mai baas zai!’ Once he formed the government, he took a u-turn. When he took a torchlight march in   against casinos, he said he would storm into casinos and close them down, but then he made a u-turn. These are cheap theatrics.”
