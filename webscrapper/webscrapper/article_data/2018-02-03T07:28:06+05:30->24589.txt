Rappers   and   have teamed up for a new song titled  .

 
  
 According to a report, the tropical-inspired house track finds the pair singing lines about feeling lost and searching for a celestial palace. While Quavo handles the hook part, Iggy is in charges of all the verses.
 
 In a short clip that was shared on   shortly after the release of the track, Azalea said that the song is about saving yourself. 
 
 "It is not a record about you needing a man or a woman to come and save you in a relationship. It's about you being your own savior and finding your own strength within yourself to figure it the f**k out.
 
 "It's a really hard record for me to have written and I think it's going to be one I really struggle to perform too, just 'cause I'll probably cry every single time," Azalea said.
 
 'Savior' is the lead track off Iggy's upcoming sophomore album  , her first album since signing to a new label.
