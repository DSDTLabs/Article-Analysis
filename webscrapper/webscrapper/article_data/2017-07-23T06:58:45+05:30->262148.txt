BENGALURU: Following strict directions issued by newly appointed ADGP   that no extra facilities be given to inmates, including   chief V K   and Abdul Kareem Telgi, convicted in the fake stamp paper racket, jail officials are ensuring the prison rules are complied with. 

 "He (Megharikh) is monitoring activities inside the prison on a regular basis. Each evening, we are sending reports on visitors who had dropped in to meet inmates, entry of private vehicles like mini trucks bringing vegetables and details of convicts working inside the jail in different capacities, patients in the jail hospital and what they are being treated for, and how many were referred to Victoria Hospital," Parappana Agrahara prison staff said.
 
 Prison officials refuted some media reports on Sasikal a being made to wear white saris instead of her regular clothes. "Some reports say Sasikala is wearing white saris, which is mandatory for convicts. Sasikala has been awarded simple imprisonment with less than seven years. Such convicts are allowed to wear coloured clothes with approval from prison officials," police said. 
 
  Only two helpers for Telgi: A source confirmed that only two convicts were appointed helpers for Telgi. "Citing health issues, he had asked four or five helpers. According to court directions, two helpers can be given when he needs them," officials said.
