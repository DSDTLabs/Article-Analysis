 All Farmers Associations’ Coordination Committee president P R Pandian said that the minister’s call had come at a time when the farming community was standing united in its efforts to safeguard the delta region from the ill effects of the ongoing oil and gas extraction work by  . “We will have no option but to resort to black flag protest against O S Manian if he doesn’t apologise, ”, he stated while asking the chief minister and deputy CM to clarify their stand about ONGC.
 
 Samba paddy harvesting had already commenced across the delta districts. But the government was yet to begin any of its promised direct procurement centres (DPCs) so far.
