MADHEPURA: The process has started for rehabilitating the families displaced from the erosion by floodwaters in  , Chausa and Puraini blocks of the district.

 District magistrate Md Suhel met the officials and people’s representatives, including JD(U) MLA  , on Monday and issued necessary instructions to select safer and suitable places for their rehabilitation. Most of the villages in the three blocks affected by floods will soon get good road and the villagers will be provided houses at safer places.
 
 Kapsiya and Goth Tola villages in Alamnagar block are the worst-hit by erosion from the Kosi river. A broader residential part of Kapsiya village has already submerged into the river. Though other villages are partly affected, threat of regular erosion looms large over them. The affected people are currently taking shelter in makeshift houses on rented plots and roadsides. “More than 1,000 such families have been identified so far,” said the DM, adding that work for rehabilitation has started. 
 
 “Not only Kapsiya, but several other villages of this riparian region are surrounded by waterlogging for around six months every year. The residents lead virtually a confined life during the period,” said   of Kapsiya village, who is also a victim of erosion. 
 
 “The region is still deprived of the road connectivity. Boats are the only option to move in this region,” he added.
