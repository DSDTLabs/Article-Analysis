KOZHIKODE: Chief minister   said that   was the safest state for minorities in the country.

 
 Addressing a meeting attended by leaders of Muslim religious organizations as part of the government’s outreach during the second anniversary celebrations of the   government on Saturday, Vijayan said that while there have been deliberate and targeted moves against minorities in many states, Kerala has remained the safest place.
 
 “There have been deliberate attempts in many parts of the country to create communal strife and even riots. But, the situation in Kerala is different. It is due to the deeply-ingrained secular culture of many Malayalis and the strong action taken by the government against communal forces, irrespective of whether they are from the majority or minority communities,” he added.
 
 Responding to the complaint raised by   that Muslim reservation norms were not properly followed even in Muslim minority institutions, the chief minister said that the government would undertake a study to study to see whether minority reservation norms are being properly followed in educational institutions. He assured the organizations that the state government will take legal steps to protect orphanages that are facing difficulties following the implementation of provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act.
 
 One among the major issues raised by Muslim organisations was the shortage of higher secondary seats in   region. The leaders said that the government order, which mandated prior sanction from the district collector for building new mosques, was posing difficulties. They urged the government to allow local self-government bodies to give the nod in such cases. They also urged the government not to move ahead with the plans to shut unrecognized schools.
 
 Some leaders alleged that a section of the police was taking a pro- Sangha Parivar attitude in many issues and that this was creating a ‘sense of vulnerability among minorities’.
