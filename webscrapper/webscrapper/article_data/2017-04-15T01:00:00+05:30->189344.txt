Sanjay Bhutiani, the producer of ' ' (international title: 'Hotel Salvation') hasn’t stopped beaming. The film, directed by his 25-year-old son Shubhashish, has been critically acclaimed and has received positive word of mouth from the audience. The film, before its release in India, had trotted the globe and picked international awards. Last week, the film and its protagonist   found special mentions in two categories at the 64th National Awards, adding to the project’s list of accolades.
“The 10-minute standing ovation for the film at the Venice World Premiere was the most memorable experience of my life. That was a big achievement. The   and National Awards mean global and national recognition which make us really proud that we have kept the country’s flag flying high. We’re happy that our country also recognises our piece of art. I feel blessed. My son’s first feature has found so much love and recognition. It makes the film even more special for me as a father and a producer. Shubhashish has made me proud,” says Sanjay.
 Shubhashish, on his part, adds, “I hoped that the audience would like the film but the response has gone beyond that. They have actually shared instances of their personal life with me after seeing the film, telling me how parts of the film resonated with their lives. The fact that they have related to it on such a personal level makes it special.”
