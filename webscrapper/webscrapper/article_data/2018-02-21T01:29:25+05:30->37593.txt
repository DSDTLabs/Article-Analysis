NEW DELHI:   (DPCC) president   condemned the alleged attack on the Delhi  . Calling it an “unfortunate incident”, Maken slammed CM   and said the incident showed the administrative failure of AAP. 

 Maken said the LG should promptly act, taking into account the seriousness of the issue. “A cordial atmosphere should be developed for administrative officers so that they could work for the development of Delhi. The LG and CM should resolve this issue at the earliest,” Maken said. 
 
 He further slammed Kejriwal, claiming that the “CM wants to prepare a narrative to hide their three years of failure by stating that they want to work but the administrative officers in Delhi are creating hurdles”. “Kejriwal should take strict legal as well as disciplinary action against his erring MLAs. If he fails to do so, Kejriwal has no right to continue as CM of Delhi,” Maken added. 
 
 Maken also said that Kejriwal has stooped very low. “During the   regime, Delhi administrative officers used to plead to be retained in their postings. But in the three years of AAP rule, the officers are getting themselves transferred. I know at least a dozen officers who are on leave without pay as they don’t want to work under the AAP-led Delhi government,” he added. 
 
 Maken said the elected representatives are the policy makers while the bureaucrats are tools to implement them. “If the elected representatives start fighting with their tools, then how will development take place in Delhi? People are paying for the misgovernance of AAP,” Maken said.
