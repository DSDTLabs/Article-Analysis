KOLKATA:   on Saturday announced levy of charges on medical representatives visiting its facility, triggering a furore across the healthcare sector with MR associations condemning the move and doctors and management of other hospitals distancing themselves.

 But Medica Group chairman   said the decision was aimed at discouraging MRs from visiting the hospital. “We don’t want MRs to come. Both the government and   want generic medicines to be prescribed. We want our doctors to do so. That can happen if MRs stop pushing branded medicines,” Roy told TOI.
 
 In a notice, the hospital has restricted the visit of a medical representative to only one day a week against a charge of Rs 350 for three hours. Beyond this, Rs 100 per hour will be levied, stated the notice that came into immediate effect.
 
  CEO   said he supported the curb on visiting time but not the charge. “The knowledge the medical representatives share is important for busy doctors who otherwise don’t have time to read journals or surf the net. We have restricted MR visits to three days for two hours in the afternoon,” he said.
 
 A Medica source said doctors had advised against the notice when they were told about it on Friday. But Roy rejected the plea. Senior officials of the three MR associations in Kolkata will seek an appointment with Medica top brass for the withdrawal of the notice.
