AHMEDABAD: It won’t be just the   side of Ahmedabad railway station that will get a “heritage look”, the entry from  , the eastern side, will undergo a complete modernisation.

 The presence of listed monuments on the Kalupur side of the railway station has prompted railway authorities to limit themselves to improving its facade and giving it a heritage-style facelift. The station may also get a dome. 
 
  “Complete redevelopment of the railway station on the Kalupur side is not possible because of the historic monuments there,” an officer said.
 
 The officer further said that if the ASI can halt construction of a toilet on Platform No.2, it would never permit complete reconstruction of the Kalupur side of the station. The authorities have hence decided to completely redevelop the eastern (Saraspur) side of the station.
 
 Officials said the Saraspur side will soon become very important, as it soon get a   station and a Bullet train platform. Officials said the   Bullet train will originate in   and have its first stop on the Saraspur side of the station, around the current platform number 12.
 
 Officials said Metro connectivity will make the Saraspur side more popular. It will get a multi-storey structure, a platform for the bullet train, an Indian railways platform and an underground Metro station. It will have modern amenities including a proper parking facility, elevators and escalators among others.
 
 On the Kalupur side, the railways will upgrade the facade in an architectural style based on the heritage of the city, including elements from the city’s darwajas and chabutaras. Officials said that nothing much can be done to the existing Kalupur-side structure, apart from external changes.
