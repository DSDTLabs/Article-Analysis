ASSI GHAT, Varanasi: In his green shirt, the 75-year-old could pass off as any other traveller but   is no ordinary tourist. On his second trip to Varanasi in a week,  's brother says his visit has nothing to do with the PM's Sunday road show.

 “These things are better left to him“ he quips.
 
 Sombhai checks in to Banaras Haveli minutes before brother Modi arrives for the roadshow. “I've come twice but not to campaign. I'm here visiting, casually meeting up, chatting with people. People's sentiments remind me of the anger with which Congress was voted out.“
 
 Derisive of the Samajwadi's 'kaam bolta hai' slogan, Sombhai says, “they couldn't build a bridge here in 10 years. Same story in Mirzapur: First Mulayam's government, then Mayawati then Akhilesh... the public will settle the matter. None can dislodge him (Modi) from their heart,“ as he heads for a holy dip.
