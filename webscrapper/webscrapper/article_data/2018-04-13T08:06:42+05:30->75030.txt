PANAJI: Food and   Administration ( ) on Thursday, citing the central government notification, has asked pharmacists to sell steroidal drugs on the prescription of registered medical practitioners (RMP) only. The steroidal drugs are also to be supplied only under the personal supervision of a registered pharmacist, it said.

 In a press statement issued on Thursday, the FDA stated that, as per the central government’s notification, steroidal drugs such as Alclometasone, Beclomethasone, Betamathasone, Desonide, Desoximetasone, Dexamethasone, Diflorasone diacetate, Fluocinonide, Fluocinolone acetonide, Halobetasol Propionate, Halometasone, Methylprednisone, Prednicarbate, Triamcinolone acetonide, are to be sold only if prescription is presented.
 
 The drugs are listed under schedule H, as per Rule 97 of Drugs and Cosmetics Act.
 
 The notification is uploaded on the website www.dfda.goa.gov.in. A local pharmacist said that this is a good step and should stop illegal sale of steroid drugs, and use of steroids in fairness creams.
 
 “People bought fairness creams containing steroids out of ignorance, while pharmacists sold these as they were not included under the prescription category,” he said.
 
 As in other states, he said in Goa too, there are some pharmacists who sell drugs without checking prescriptions. “It is also difficult to stick to prescriptions all the time as most of them operate in small set ups,” he said.
