RANCHI: The newly raised   (SISF) will be deployed at the Central Coalfields Limited (CCL)'s   in Tandwa block of Chatra district after it came under attack by suspected CPI (Maoist) operatives late on Wednesday night. 

 DIG (Hazaribag range) Bheemsen Tuti, Chatra SP Anjani Jha and deputy commissioner Sandeep Singh on Thursday inspected the camp site of BGR, a sub-leased company responsible for coal extraction at the project. 
 
 A group of at least 20 members of the outfit began their attack on the company camp site at approximately 10pm and triggered an explosion at the company office. Three members of BGR's staff were hurt in the explosion and are presently undergoing treatment.
 
 The explosion alarmed the Indian Reserve Batallion personnel deployed near the camp and they opened fire on the rebels. The rebels were attempting to burn the vehicles at the site when they came under attacked. The rebels were forced to leave the site after the gunfight.
 
 Chatra SP Anjani Jha said, "The contractor for the site,  , was not available for questioning because of which it is not possible for us to determine the reason for the attack. A poster left at the site claims that the attack was conducted by CPI (Maoist) and that CCL must halt the Amrapaali project."
