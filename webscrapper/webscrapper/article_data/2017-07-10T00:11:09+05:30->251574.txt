Hyderabad: Telangana Pradesh   Committee (TPCC) president N Uttam Kumar Reddy on Sunday urged the state government to take measures on a war footing to provide cash and credit facilities to farmers for the   season.

 Addressing a public meeting at Garidepally Praja Garjana at Huzurnagar in Suryapet district, Reddy said farming activities have been badly hit due to severe cash and credit crunch, forcing farmers to forego the benefits of a good monsoon. 
 
 Quoting the latest report of the agriculture department, released on July 5, he said sowing of seeds has reached only 18.81 lakh hectares out of 43.24 lakh hectares in this Kharif season. 
 
 He said that the State Level Bankersâ€™ Committee (SLBC), in its meeting on July 7, admitted that so far an amount of Rs 4,700 crore has been disbursed to only 7.65 lakh farmers. This is much less than the actual amount needed by farmers in Telangana. 
 
 He attributed all this to farmers not getting timely help from any quarter. Saying that the chief minister should have convened a special meeting with the SLBC to bail out farmers, he said KCR should have directly approached Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Arun Jaitley to resolve the issues.
 
 Most farmers are being denied fresh loans due to the non-clearance of the fourth instalment of crop loan waiver scheme by the TRS government. Banks should be directed to issue loans by keeping pening loans in abeyance till the crop season is over, he said.
