 The 23-year-old from Haryana, a silver medallist at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games and bronze winner at the 2014 Incheon Asian Games, had earned a dramatic come-from-behind win over Kyrgysztan's Aisuluu Tynybekova to script history becoming the first woman wrestler from India to bag an Olympic medal and only the fourth female athlete from the country to stand atop a podium at the pinnacle of world sport, when she won bronze medal at the Rio de Janeiro Games. It was India's 25th medal at the Olympic Games since independence in 1947. 
 
 Sakshi, who began training when she was 12, now stands as an icon for Indian women’s athletes and what makes her story even more remarkable is where she comes from. Her bronze medal is a major victory over sexism in one of India's most conservative states, Haryana, where women have long been treated as second-class citizens and ‘honour killings’ and sex-selective abortions are rife.
 
 The video is a part of the Janam Se Janani initiative and #EveryWomanStrong campaign of   Group, a flagship CSR Programme for girls and women across 1000 villages in 9 states, assisting them with Education, Healthcare and Livelihood.
