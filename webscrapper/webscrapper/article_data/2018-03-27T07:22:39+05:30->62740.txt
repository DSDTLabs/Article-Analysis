MOHALI: Boozers have good days ahead as liquor prices may come down by 10% to 15% in Mohali, claimed the excise department officials on Monday.  , assistant excise and taxation commissioner (AETC) said that according to the new excise policy, the number of liquor vends have been increased but the groups have been reduced which is beneficial for all the three stake holders — government, traders and end consumers.

 “This step has been taken to break the monopoly of the liquor traders by opening the wider options for bidders. This will not only fetch more revenue to government but will also create competition amongst the traders resulting in reduction of liquor cost by 10% to 15%. We expect good revenue and benefits for public and government. We have capped the minimum sale price for the vendor declared by the government not to be charged over 12.5% from minimum sale price.”
