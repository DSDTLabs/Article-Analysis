KOLKATA: The death of Rahman Saddar (58), crushed under the wheels of a speeding truck, which was heading towards Baruipur late on Wednesday night not to far from   crossing, not only got the locals agitated and riotous, but has exposed the major traffic hurdles in the area. The 58-year-old was a resident of Garia’s Ramkrish Nanagar and was a security guard by profession.

 The angry locals claimed there is little co-ordination between South 24 Parganas police and  . Locals said the area has become an extortion den with auto operators, hawkers and even civic cops are found collecting money. Road encroachment and illegal parking and little channelling of traffic adds to the problem.
 
 Residents of the area said Saddar was a victim of police extortion. “The trucks here speed in order to escape checking. The   bridge area and the petrol pump just ahead of the   crossing are their favourite hunting grounds,” alleged Swapan Maiti, who runs a shop adjoining the   station.
 
 “The victim had completed his night duty and was crossing near Sitala mandir when the incident took place. He died on the spot after suffering severe head and waist injuries. Locals refused to let cops take the body away. They agitated in front of police against alleged poor traffic management and the extortion of money from drivers. Soon a scuffle broke out between cops and locals. Later cops resorted to lathicharge,” said a local.
 
 Cops from Sonarpur police station, however, denied there was lathicharge. “Show me one case where our men were caught on camera or in a photo seeking money,” said an official.
 
 Kolkata Police said the deployment od cops near Dhalai Bridge was done to check drunken driving. “The trucks sometimes block the entry point. We are trying to ensure that there is no truck parked here,”said a traffic cop posted at the spot. TOIcarried out a recce to identify the problems claimed by the locals.
