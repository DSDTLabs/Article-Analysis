PATNA: Escalating its attack against chief minister  , RJD on Monday asked him to step down. “A person facing murder charge has no moral right to continue on the CM’s chair. He is facing charges under Section 302 of IPC as well as Section 27 of the Arms Act. He should quit immediately and return to the chair only after the court acquits him in the case,” RJD senior   and state party president   told reporters.
 
  Raking up the 1991 murder case registered with Pandarak police station in Patna district, Jagadanand and Purbey also demanded speedy trial of the case. “Is the case in which Nitish is accused not fit for speedy trial?” they asked.
  
  “A Barh court took cognisance in the case in 2009. Since then, Nitish has been continuing as the CM while ignoring the court’s cognisance,” Jagadanand alleged.
  
  An hour after Nitish resigned as CM of the   government in Bihar on July 26, RJD boss Lalu Prasad had also said, “Nitish pulled out of the grand alliance because he is an accused in a murder case.”
  
  On July 27, Lalu tweeted an image of the Nitish’s affidavit to the   at the time of filing of nomination papers for the legislative council polls. In the affidavit, Nitish has mentioned the murder case against him in Barh court.
  
  A day later, Nitish’s JD(U) said the police had filed a final report in the case after investigation. The police did not find Nitish guilty of murder and declared the charges against him as “untrue”. Later, one Ashok Singh filed a complaint petition in the ACJM court at Barh, in which Nitish has been made accused. The matter related to the complaint case is still pending before the Patna high court, JD(U) minister Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh had said.
