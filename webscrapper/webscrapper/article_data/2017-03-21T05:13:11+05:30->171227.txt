 For Kerala tourism, Russia is the seventh biggest originating market with 32,726 tourist arrivals registered in 2015. “The state’s rich ayurveda tradition continues to be a difference-maker for us at our promotional campaigns around the world. Despite competing claims from emerging markets, tourists and trade operators know that our authenticity and mastery of the ancient tradition is unmatched anywhere,” said tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran.
 
 While Goa and Sri Lanka are popular beach destinations for Russian travelers, a large majority prefers Kerala for the relaxing experience it offers. 
 
 “With excellent air and sea connectivity, Kerala is well placed to take advantage of growing interest and demand. To maximise returns, Kerala Tourism is planning to hold FAM tours for select tour operators and mediapersons from Russia to better spread the message of the state’s healing touch,” said tourism additional director  .
