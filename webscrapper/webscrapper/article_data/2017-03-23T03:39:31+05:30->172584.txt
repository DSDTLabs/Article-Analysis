KOLKATA: Former   (ED) assistant director Manoj Kumar, accused in two  , lost the legal immunity to a purported police action after the Calcutta high court turned down his anticipatory   on Wednesday. 

 Kolkata Police is waiting for a copy of the court order before they call Kumar for questioning in connection with two criminal complaints - one lodged at Shakespeare Sarani police station and the other at Hare Street police station. During the course of investigation, the accused took the plea of a departmental examination to avoid his personal appearance to the police stations. While taking this plea, Kumar moved the anticipatory bail petition in the high court.
 
 Kumar moved the high court soon after chartered accountant Kamal Somani lodged a complaint against city-based travel agent Pradip Hirawat on February 28, stating the latter had been making calls demanding Rs 1 crore to fend off further raids on his firm.
 
 Things took a turn when Hirawat in his magisterial statement said Kumar was the brain behind the entire operation. Kumar's lawyer Y Z Dastoor submitted to the court his client conducted the raids at Somani's office but did not ask for money.
 
 Advocate general Kishore Dutta and senior public prosecutor Swaswata Gopal Mukherjee submitted to the court Kumar is allegedly the key person in parking black money abroad. 
 
 According to police, Kumar got closer to Hirawat because the latter used to book his tours with Rose Valley CEO's wife Subhra Kundu to many places.
