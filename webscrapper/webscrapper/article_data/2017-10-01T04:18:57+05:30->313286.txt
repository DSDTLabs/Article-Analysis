Mumbai: The Bhoiwada police on Saturday arrested two people, who, claiming to be Shiv Sainiks from the Pimpri Chinchwad area, roughed up the head of forensics department at  , Dr Harish Pathak, and tried to write on his forehead.

 The police registered an offence under IPC sections of trespassing and unlawful assembly against five unknown person for entering KEM Hospital and trying to do “some mischief” with senior doctors.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (zone 4) N Ambika said Nilesh Dhumal and Yuvraj Dhakle were detained and being questioned. The police are on the lookout for three others who accompanied Dhumal and Dhakle to the mortuary.
 
 In a statement given to the police, Dr Pathak said the accused entered his room in the mortuary and attempted to write on his forehead. However, they were stopped by a reporter from a national daily who covered Dr Pathak’s forehead with her palm. ``As we raised our voices, the security guards rushed in,’’ said Dr Pathak.
 
 The accused were heard shouting that they were protesting against the tagging system used to number the dead brought in from the   station stampede on Friday.
 
 On Friday morning, as 22 bodies were brought to KEM Hospital, doctors tagged each with a number written across their foreheads in red ink. A police official had said the hospital staff had given them photos of each of the dead to make a poster, which was then prominently displayed in the hospital campus. 
 
 Dr Pathak had later in the evening clarified that tagging was done to reduce the allround chaos when relatives rushed to hospital. “We could identify 19 dead bodies within three hours and started the process of panchnama. After autopsy, these numbers were erased before the bodies were handed over to the families.’’
