AHMEDABAD:   on Tuesday directed Gir-Somnath district police to register an FIR in an incident of firing, in which former BJP MP   faces allegations of criminal conspiracy.

 Earlier this month, the HC directed the registration of two FIRs against Solanki for his alleged involvement in a case of rioting and an assault on an RTI activist. The court even transferred the probe in both the cases to CID (crime). This time, the HC directed SP of Gir-Somnath district to ensure that the FIR is properly registered. 
 
  In this case, one Dudhiben and her son Kush Kamaliya approached the court for the time with a complaint that despite the HC’s directions, Kodinar police did not register an FIR for the firing on the son on October 11, 2016. The petitioners have been alleging that the firing took place at the behest of former MP.
 
 The petitioners’ advocate   submitted that Kamaliya was fired at by two persons, Natha Solanki and Vijay Ahir, after he was chased in Kodinar’s market. Kamaliya called the control room and made his complaint, his mother went to the police station with other relatives to get the FIR registered. But they were turned away by the cops. 
 
 Instead of lodging Kamaliya’s FIR, the former MP got him falsely implicated in a case of bootlegging. He hence cannot go to the police station. He even expressed apprehensions about the a threat to his life. The HC had earlier directed cops to ensure proper protection when the mother-son duo go to the police station to register the FIR. However, police did not register the FIR, which led the petitioners to approach the HC again.
 
 Earlier, the HC had castigated the police and state government for shielding   because he belongs to the ruling party. The HC rued the situation prevailing in the country, which is helplessly witnessing criminalization of politics and rampant corruption. The HC said that the police and administration genuflect to those who are in power.
