PUNE: The Pune railway authorities are considering suspension of the   diesel multiple unit (DMU) service citing lack of passengers. 
 
 “Hardly 40-45 passengers travel on that train. We have not arrived at a final decision but we may be cancelling it soon. Around half-an-hour to an hour before its schedule, another train goes in the same direction,” said Pune DRM  . 
  
 The DMU service was started in May last year. Harsha Shah, president of the  , said, “Why didn’t the railways conduct a proper feasibility study before introducing these rakes? As per rules, if a train is witnessing 10-15% passenger traffic, they should run.” 
  
 Vikas Deshpande, the president of the Daund-Pune Pravasi Sangh, said, “The train leaves Pune at 10.30am. How will a daily passenger benefit when the train starts at this time? The train from   comes to Pune at 1.30pm. We have sent a letter to the authorities suggesting that the train should be started from Pune at 5am.”
