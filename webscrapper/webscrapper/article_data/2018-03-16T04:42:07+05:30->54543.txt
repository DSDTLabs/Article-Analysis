GURUGRAM: Animal lovers and residents of   1 filed a police complaint on Wednesday after six stray puppies in the area were killed and buried by unknown persons. An FIR has been registered, and cops are investigating the matter.

 Amita Singh, the president of Walk for Animals and Habitat, an NGO, said some residents of DLF 1 approached her after they couldn’t find the puppies when they went to feed them on Tuesday evening. “When Malvika Khatri, a resident who used to feed them, asked around, she was told by labourers working on a nearby plot that the pups had been killed and buried. On searching further, she found the body of one puppy thrown on a plot and five more buried in nearby vacant plots,” Singh told TOI.
 
 Singh then approached police. On the basis of her complaint, an FIR was filed against unidentified persons under sections 11(1) of the Prevention of Animal Cruelty Act and 429 (mischief by maiming or killing cattle) of IPC at DLF 1 police station.
 
 Residents said there were a total of 15 stray puppies in the area. While six were found dead, three were found abandoned in a nearby vacant plot and the rest are missing. A worker cleaning the sewer lines buried the puppies after he noticed the bodies. 
 
 Animal lovers alleged they had earlier been threatened by the owners of a guesthouse in the area and some residents that “these pups bite us so we will finish them”.
 
 They also alleged that cops at the station weren’t co-operative and the FIR was registered only after SHO Kailash Devi intervened and ordered them to probe the matter.
 
 Singh said when police took cognisance of the matter and sent one of the bodies for post-mortem to a veterinary hospital in Chakkarpur, the doctor there didn’t have any equipment and ruled out poisoning without doing any tests. Meanwhile, cops said the official report is still awaited. “We have registered a case and are probing the matter,” a police spokesperson said.
