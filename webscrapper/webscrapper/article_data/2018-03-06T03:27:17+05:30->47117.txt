When there is the law on one side and the outlaws on the other, life can be a dilemma. Banshi Lal   knows the compulsions well. But the 42-year-old police constable from Bastar, who grew up in a remote village in Maoist-hit Kanker district of Chhattisgarh, wants the youth of conflict zones to know that there are options. Hoping to inspire them even as he desires to make Bastar known by epithets other than “conflict zone”, Netam set out on Monday from   on a 6,000-km cycle ride along the Golden Quadrilateral. His aim is to spread the message of peace in the Maoist zones of Kanker, Bastar and Dantewada.

 Along the way, the slender, lycra-clad policeman hopes to break the record of Delhi’s Devanshu Shivnani, who traversed the   highway network in 20 days. “My daughter wants that I should complete my journey in 18 days,” Banshi recalled his 7-year- old child in Bastar telling him before pedalling off.
