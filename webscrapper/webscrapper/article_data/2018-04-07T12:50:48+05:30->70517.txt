COIMBATORE: After Race Course and railway station, it is the turn of   bus stand to become a Wi-Fi zone. 

 Former chief minister   had announced free Wi-Fi project for various locations across the state. In 2017, Rs 8.50 crore was allotted for this purpose. “We have set up Wi-Fi zones at Marina beach, Chennai, Gandhipuram bus stand, Salem bus terminus, Trichy bus terminus and Madurai MGR bus stand under Amma Free ‘Wi-Fi’ zones,” said an official. 
 
 Chief minister   inaugurated the facility through video conferencing from Chennai on Friday. Commuters can access Wi-Fi for free for the first 20 minutes and Rs 10 for every one hour after that. The download speed may vary depending on the number of concurrent users in the hotspot. The user can continue browsing beyond 20 minutes by logging in as a premium user and can get the guaranteed 4 MBPS download speed.
 
 Officials said that the Tamil Nadu Arasu Cable TV Corporation was implementing the project. 
 
 In Gandhipuram, thousands of commuters come every day. “This Wi-Fi will be useful for them, especially students,” said an official adding that the users will have to select the Wi-Fi and register after which they will get a one-time password. Once that is entered, they can use Wi-Fi for free for first 20 minutes. “After first 20 minutes, a nominal Rs 10 per hour will be charged,” he said. 
 
 The city corporation has already installed Wi-Fi at Race Course and corporation main office. The railway department installed Wi-Fi at the central railway station. 
 
 “The idea is to bring all the major locations under Wi-Fi zones,” said an official. The pilot project will get to see a lot of added attractions in the coming months. 
 
 In the backdrop of high mobile connectivity in the state, former chief minister J Jayalalithaa announced in 2016 the Wi-Fi zones in bus stands, commercial complexes and public parks in the state and promised to introduce in 50 areas initially.
