LUCKNOW: Every day, 30% of the water the city generates goes to waste. 

 Aspiring to be a Smart City, Lucknow has an uphill task to provide sufficient water to its population of about 35 lakh. 
 
 The city's water requirement is about 600 million litres per day (MLD) whereas Jal Sansthan produces about 705 MLD. However, it is unable to feed all colonies equally.
 
 According to urban standards, each person should get 150 litres of water daily but in Lucknow the distribution is skewed towards a few colonies. 
 
 The deprived colonies often complain of scant supply, poor pressure and sometimes even dirt and sewage mixed with water, but Jal Sansthan has not taken any step to ensure clean and sufficient water supply there. 
 
  Colonies with high dependence on tubewells such as Alambagh, Aliganj, Vikasnagar,   and Aashiana face shortage because of depleting water table. 
 
  Corporator Mamta Choudhary said, "The situation is worse in colonies fed by   waterworks. Around two dozen colonies such as Yahyaganj, Raja Bazaar, Malaviyanagar, Tilaknagar and   daily face low pressure and supply because of power tripping at Aishbagh." 
 
 The second waterworks, in Balaganj, supplies water to Thakurganj, Rajendranagar, Chowk and   and often faces dirty supply. Mugdha of Kashmiri Mohalla said, "  has very old network of pipelines. Most are old and worn out, hence they easily develop leakages and attract pollutants, including sewage." 
 
 Kathauta waterworks supplies water to Indiranagar and Gomtinagar and is fed through Sharda Canal. Supply here is stopped often owing to the frequent cleaning of the canal. 
 
 While Jal Sansthan said it was busy fixing leakages, it said Jal Nigam would soon begin re-boring of tubewells to avoid a crisis.
