PUDUCHERRY: The Puducherry government has brought the   to postgraduate, undergraduate, diploma and part-time courses in government and private colleges (government quota seats) under a single platform and counselling process. 

 
 Altogether, there are 58 engineering and arts and science colleges in the Union territory. The government has prepared a comprehensive common admission prospectus and information bulletin with complete details of the colleges, courses offered, number of seats available, reservation pattern, fee structure and eligibility and selection criteria. The students can download the prospectus and bulletin free of cost from the centralised admission committee (Centac) website www.centacpuducherry.in from Wednesday, chief minister   said.
 
 Addressing a press conference in the presence of health minister  , agriculture minister  , who holds the portfolio of school and collegiate education, secretary (education) A   and Centac coordinator (admissions) T Rudra Goud, among others,   said the students have to fill up a common application online with options to choose their desired courses. "There is no need for the students to apply in different colleges for different courses," he said, adding that the government has set up 30 help desks in all government colleges and higher secondary schools to guide the students on filling up the application forms and choosing the courses.
 
 "The students need not visit the colleges. They can pay the application and processing fees online or by demand draft. The government will hold counselling using computer modules to help students choose as many courses as possible and to reduce travel and other costs and save time. The new procedure will ensure maximum number of seats is filled up and eliminate human intervention to bring transparency in the admission process", Anbarasu said.
