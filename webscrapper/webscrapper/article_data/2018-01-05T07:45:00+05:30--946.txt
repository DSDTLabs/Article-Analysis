BATHINDA: Wrestler-turned-cop-turned drug lord   appeared before a Bathinda court on Thursday in a case registered against him under the NDPS Act in 2002. Bhola was acquitted in the case and after being let off he had filed an application against three cops who had implicated him.

 Bhola recorded his statement as evidence in the court of additional sessions judge Kanwaljit Singh against Gurdeep Singh, then SI, and  , then DSP, for falsely implicating him in the case. He is presently facing cases in a Rs 6,000 crore synthetic drug racket and has alleged former Punjab ministers’ involvement in it.

While deciding the case on July 13, 2007, the court had sentenced Kewal and Mahesh to 10 years imprisonment each, along with a fine of Rs 1 lakh fine each, and had acquitted Bhola.
 
 Bhola’s counsel   said, “After Bhola was acquitted, he had filed an application against   and DSP Gill for falsely implicating him in the case. The matter was taken by additional sessions judge on Thursday, where Bhola recorded his statement.”
