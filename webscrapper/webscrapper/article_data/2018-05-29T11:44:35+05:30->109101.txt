The much awaited show ‘Ganga Manga’ by the creator of ‘Baahubali’ Dr KV Vijayendra Prasad premiered on May 28 at 6:30 PM.

  The channel the show airs on conducted a poll on their social media asking viewers for their feedback regarding the show. They wrote, “What did you like most about the   of #GangaManga? a. Concept b. Story c. Direction d. Actors e. Others. Please share your valuable feedback in the comments section below.” (sic)
 
  Going by the feedback provided to the channel in the comment section, while some liked everything about the show and others liked the direction, the concept and actors are what most people liked. Looks like the first episode of the new show was received well by the viewers, even though it remains to be seen how the future episodes will fare.
 
  Before the premiere, the channel was busy promoting the show heavily on their social media, with even   being a part of the promotions. The promos of the show have received good response on social media, raking in good amount of views, likes and shares. The show seems to be about two just-born babies who are exchanged by two heartbroken women, with a narrator stating that the poorer of the two had given up the baby to the rich family, in return for their baby. Ganga grows up humbly in a totalitarian village as the child of loving, but poor parents. Manga on the other hand, grows up arrogant in a rich home, much to the chagrin of her parents and grandmother who try to discipline her.
