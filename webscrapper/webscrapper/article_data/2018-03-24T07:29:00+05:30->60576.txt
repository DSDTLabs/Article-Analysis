Chandigarh: Flagging the unresponsiveness of the Punjab government to audit, the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) has pointed out that various state government departments have not even bothered to submit replies to 17,982 audit inspection reports of various years containing 40,873 paragraphs till March 2017. This is despite the fact that serious irregularities are also brought to the notice of concerned department heads by the office of the principal accountant general (audit), Punjab, through a half-yearly report of pending inspection reports sent to the principal secretary of the finance department.

 These irregularities have come to fore in the CAG report tabled in the Punjab assembly on Thursday. The CAG report says, “Pendency of such large number of paragraphs indicated lack of responsiveness of the government departments to audit.”
 
 Periodical inspection of the government departments is carried out by CAG by test-check of transactions and verification of the maintenance of important accounting and other records. After inspections, the audit department sends reports to the departments concerned. The rules stipulate that the departments send their replies within four weeks of the receipt of these reports.
 
 The audit report points out that on the directions of Public Accounts Committee (PAC), the Punjab finance department had in August 1992, issued instructions to all administrative departments to initiate suo motu action on all paragraphs and reviews figuring in audit reports irrespective of the fact whether the cases were taken up for examination by PAC or not. The departments are also required to furnish detailed notes duly vetted by audit to PAC, indicating the remedial action taken or proposed to be taken by them within three months of the presentation of reports to the state assembly.
 
 Whereas the audit reports related to financial years 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16, that have been laid before the state legislature, detailed notes in respect of 32 paragraphs and seven performance audits had not been received in the audit office till October 31, 2017. Major defaulting departments include: irrigation, public works (building and roads), revenue, rehabilitation and disaster management.
 
 The CAG has also highlighted that 20 Separate Audit Reports (SAR) in respect of five autonomous bodies issued between February 2012 and July 2017 were pending for placement before the state legislature till date. These include Punjab Legal Services Authority, Punjab Khadi and Villages Industries Board, Punjab State Human Rights Commission, Punjab Labour Welfare Board and Punjab Building and other Construction Works Welfare Board.
