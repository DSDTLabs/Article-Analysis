  As we began with the introduction round, more than 70 students registered. Emcee Gitesh Singh kept the students at ease and encouraged them all through the three rounds, while DJ   danced with the crowd and played some popular tracks. As Kaptan Laadi started performing, many students not only danced with the singer but also requested him to sing a few of their favourite songs. Talking about the contestants, Laadi told us, "All of them seemed very serious about Fresh Face. I really liked the winners and I believe that they will be quite successful in their careers ahead."
