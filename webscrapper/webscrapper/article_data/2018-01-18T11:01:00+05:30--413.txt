HYDERABAD: There are over 400 structures in Hyderabad limits and about 600 in   and Rachakonda limits hampering the city’s traffic flow. These obstructions include buildings, graveyards, religious structures like temples and chillas, trees, electric poles and electric towers standing bang in the middle of roads.

 While the stretch from BHEL to Kukatpally has at least six religious structures either cutting the road into two or entirely taking up one side of the road, compelling vehicles to squeeze through the remaining space, many of these structures are now much below the road level.
 
 One such structure right outside the Pride Honda showroom is almost five feet below the road level. “Each time the road was carpeted, this religious structure started being a little less visible due to the increasing level of the road. Now it is almost invisible from road level and though I know its location, many times I have driven my two wheeler almost to the spot where the road suddenly drops leading to the structure,” said  , a local.
 
 While at the beginning of the Hafeezpet flyover traffic literally divides into two while passing by a religious structure, there are some locations with an entire HT line tower sitting on the road.
 
 “Recently I was navigating through Raghavendra Colony’s lanes from the   road and was startled to find an electricity grid structure right in the middle of the road,” said commuter  . Traffic cops have now drawn up a list of 306 electric poles and sent a report to TS Transco. They have also sent a list of 60-65 structures (buildings and religious structures) in Hyderabad limits to GHMC so that they can be relocated or road widening works be taken up, said  , inspector (traffic, engineering wing), Hyderabad Traffic Police.
