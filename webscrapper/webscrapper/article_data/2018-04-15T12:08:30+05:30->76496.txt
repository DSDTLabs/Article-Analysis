VADODARA: The controversy over   (DPIL) promoter Amit  , who is accused of cheating banks to the tune of Rs 2,654 crore, remained in focus even at the ceremony of the 15th   for Excellence where union minister Maneka Gandhi was the chief guest on Saturday. 

 As announcement regarding the awardees was being made category-wise, Bhatnagar’s name cropped up twice in the list of jury members of the awards. 
 
 While announcing the awards in each category, an   official first did not mention Bhatnagar’s name when he was reading out the list of jury members who had taken the decision of conferring award in the category of outstanding contribution in the field of corporate social responsibilities (CSR). 
 
 But as soon as the award was conferred, the office-bearer corrected himself and read out Bhatnagar’s name. Bhatnagar was also a jury member in the award category for outstanding contribution to Mission ‘Swachh Bharat’. Later, FGI president Nitin Mankad said that Bhatnagar was part of the jury as a member of the federation’s managing committee. 
 
 The union minister too had to face queries regarding Bhatnagar. 
 
 “I have attended the programme on the invitation that was extended to me by the body (FGI). The investigating agencies will carry out their probe,” said Maneka Gandhi. 
 
 Earlier, during her speech, Gandhi on a lighter note had remarked that “behind every successful business, there is a public sector bank.” 
 
 “Unfortunately, large NPAs have come from  . But the state has also taken a lead when it comes to setting examples in enterprise,” she had said.
