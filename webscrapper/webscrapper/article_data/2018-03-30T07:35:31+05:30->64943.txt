LUCKNOW: The enforcement directorate (ED) has registered a case of money laundering against eight senior engineers of UP’s irrigation department in the Rs 1,513 crore   case. The ED will interrogate the three chief engineers and five superintendent engineers separately on their foreign trips.

 
 On December 2, 2017, the CBI had registered a case against the eight engineers, charging them with criminal misconduct by a public servant, criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery of valuable security, forgery for purpose of cheating, using forged documents as genuine and demand of illegal gratification.
 
 
 The scam had surfaced after the   government came to power in Uttar Pradesh and constituted a high-powered committee to review the   development plan — a flagship project of the previous Akhilesh Yadav government — which was incomplete even though bulk of the Rs 1,513 crore fund had been spent.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 CM Yogi Adityanath inspected the project on March 19 and ordered an inquiry by a highpowered committee headed by retired high court judge Alok Kumar Singh. The committee came across several financial irregularities and summed them up in a 74-page report, that highlighted over expenditure and poor monitoring. Another four-member committee headed by minister for urban development   was formed to recommend action against the eight engineers.
 
 
 The first FIR was registered on June 19, 2017 against chief engineers Gulesh Chand, SN Sharma, Kazim Ali and five superintendent engineers Shiv Mangal Yadav, Akhil Raman,  ,   Yadav and Surendra Yadav. They were accused of misappropriating funds and other anomalies. ED officials told TOI that a set of questions has been prepared for each of the accused who will be interrogated separately.
