 towards boys is not new to TN, but data shows the gap is wider in most north and central districts when compared to several southern districts.

 In the past five years, the   at birth -number of girls born per 1,000 boys -in the state has dipped to 911 in 2016-17 from 923 in 2011-12, according to the   Health Management Information System. With a 94-point dip in the past five years, Cheyyar, near Tiruvannamalai, has recorded the sharpest plunge.In 2016-17, the health unit district recorded a sex ratio of 887, down from 981in 2012-13.
 
 On the other hand, despite the fall, southern districts such as Ramanathapuram, Paramakudi (Ramanathapuram), Nagercoil (Kanyakumari), Tuticorin and Sankarankovil (Tirunelveli) have shown a healthy sex ratio ranging between 942 and 964. But officials say these areas may see a drastic fall too if preventive action is not taken. “In most southern districts, we had focused on preventing infanticide and the results are good. But now we see human interference of a different kind,“ said director of public health Dr K Kolan daswamy , who is also the registrar of births. “Sex-selective abortions have led to an imbalance and can lead to problems such as higher homicide rates,“ he said.
 
 The rampant violation of the Pre-Conception and PreNatal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994 is evident in the survey done nationally and across the state. Although officials have been cracking down on  , unethical doctors and quacks, officials say they have only touched the tip of the iceberg.
