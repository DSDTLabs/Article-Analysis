Vadodara: It’s hard to miss the sight of this senior citizen who walks around the Sayajibaug daily morning. Prashant Rakshit, a retired EME teacher, patiently dusts the old iron bridge over Vishwamitri Bridge and the heritage ‘chhatris’ in the park for a while and then moves on. His cleaning act invites quite a few glances and some even approach him with curious questions.  “I just tell them that I am doing my duty as a citizen and helping the civic body in keeping the park clean,” said 71-year-old Rakshit.  He is seen dusting the old iron bridge near the zoo, the ‘chhatris’ nearby and the ones near the water fountain along with the new cable-stayed bridge.  “I use a brush and a piece of cloth to clean up the dust and make the structures look spic and span,” Rakshit told TOI. He has taken up this cleaning exercise for 20 days now and plans to keep doing it in the coming days. When asked why he took upon him the task to keep the public properties clean, Rakshit said, “When my wife visited Sayajibaug after a gap of six months, she found that lot of structures are dusty. She told me following which I approached the officials who sit near the park’s gate. They did send in a man who cleaned up the iron bridge for a few days.”  “But it wasn’t enough. So instead of complaining I decided to contribute my bit and took to dusting the structures in the park. I do the cleaning for about 20 minutes daily. Many walkers offer to help and I tell them to pick up the habit of cleaning our public places. Now the civic body has cleaned up the iron bridge,” Rakshit, who has been staying in the city for last 36 years, added. He said that he got inspired to dust the public places from the Japanese channels he watches on TV. “They keep their public places, temples and parks very clean. It’s admirable,” he said.
