Ludhiana: The education department has started a probe against a Khanna school teacher after an anonymous letter, purported written by students, accused him of sexual harassment. 

 In the letter sent to Punjab secretary (education) Krishan Kumar, chief secretary, chief minister and President, the “students” said they were poor and facing harassment at the hands of Punjabi teacher. “There is a cabin in the principal office where the teacher sits with girl students and tells them not to study and that he will get them passed. He asks students to wear jeans as they look good in it,” the letter (a copy of which is with The Times of India) stated.
 
 The “students” alleged that they took up the matter with the school principal, but to no avail. 
 
 “The teacher has been transferred seven times because of his behaviour. He should now be dismissed so that he cannot play with the lives of other students,” the letter added. 
 
 Refuting the allegations, the 51-year-old teacher told the TOI that the letter was fake and the matter was being investigated. 
 
 “The secretary (education) called up the school principal. As the letter is being circulated on social media, I will lodge a defamation complaint with the crime branch. It appears to be the handiwork of some staff members.” 
 
 The school principal said, “The education department is looking into the complaint. The allegations against me are baseless.” 
 
 The secretary (education) could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.
