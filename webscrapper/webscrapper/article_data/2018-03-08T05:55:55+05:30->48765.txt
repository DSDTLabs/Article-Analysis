KOLKATA: Kolkata   (KMRC) has evacuated the seventh building — marked as ‘critical’ — at Dalhousie for the tunneling of   corridor.

 In December last year, KMRC identified seven crumbling structures in the Dalhousie-BBD Bag area as ‘critical’ and evacuated three of them in January. On Tuesday, an evacuation notice was pasted on 11 Government Place (East). Shopowners — none resides in the building — were asked to vacate the premises right away.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 “The people of business units located in 11Government Place East along with all people doing business on the adjacent areas are hereby requested not to stay at their premises/area during the movement of eastbound TBM of East-West Metro corridor project from 18 hours of 6 March, 2018 to 10 hours of 9 March as a safety measure,” read the notice pasted on the structure.
 
 But the shopowners and the employees — around 70 in total — took their own time and downed shutters only at their closing time. Since the building has commercial establishments only, KMRC did not have to make arrangments for a hotel like it had done twice earlier.
 
 Rachna, the tunnel-boring machine (TBM) burrowing and building the Salt Lake-bound tunnel, will take two days to trudge past the structure that badly needs strengthening and grouting. Apart from taking extensive reinforcement measures inside the century-and-a-half-old structure, the pavement in front has been cordoned off by executing agency Afcons-Transtonnelstroy to prevent casualty in case concrete tumbles down.
 
 “The condition of this building is not as bad as the other five structures on the other side of   Hotel. But we are not taking chances,” said an official. Lalit Great Eastern didn’t have to be evacuated since its condition was reported as ‘satisfactory’ in the survey conducted by KMRC.
