Call it the ‘Mahanati 02effect’. Director Nag Ashwin, who has won both critical and commercial acclaim for his biopic on yesteryear cine icon  , will direct the Megastar next.   himself admitted as much at a press conference held at his residence on Saturday, where he personally lauded Nag and the film’s producers. We dug a little deeper to find out that director is working on a script that revolves around time travel. “It is an ambitious film that will revolve around a time machine. Chiranjeevi loved the idea and gave   his nod to develop the script. The director will need about six to seven months time to complete the script. If it works out, this could well be Chiranjeevi’s 152nd film,” reveals a source close to the director.
