Coimbatore: Passport   in the city has become quicker and easier, thanks to the tablet devices installed with ‘M   Police’ application. A total of 15 tablets have been given to as many police stations in the city for verifying passport applications. The app has been provided by the ministry of external affairs to the police department. 

 Now, police officials would visit the applicant’s residence with the GPS-enabled tablets. There they would verify the applicant’s date of birth record, address proof and educational record against the copies uploaded in the app. The officer then clicks a picture of the applicant and the applicant’s signature and uploads them in the app along with a picture of his signature.
 
 The inspector would attach his signature through his account and send it to the commissionerate, from where it would be sent to the passport office for further processing. A police officer said they were given a day's training to use the app. “We have been using it for almost a week now,” the officer said.
 
 The main benefit of the app is that it does away with   and  , said officials. 
 
 “Earlier, the verification process took about 20 days. Now we expect the app to bring it down to four to five days,” said G Sivakumar, regional passport officer, Coimbatore.
 
 Also, people now feel satisfied that the verification process has become transparent, said a police officer who was verifying passport applicants in the city on Wednesday. “As we approve their forms in the app right in front of them, they feel secure,” said the officer.
 
 Officials said the app had come as a boon for remote areas where it took longer to get forms across for verification.
