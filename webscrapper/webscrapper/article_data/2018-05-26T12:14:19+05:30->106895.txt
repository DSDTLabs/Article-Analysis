It looks like Tollywood superstar   has a new fan — and it's come from the most unusual quarters. It's none other than Afghan cricketer and a key player for   Hyderabad,  . Rashid has single-handedly taken Team Hyderabad to the final of the ongoing Indian Premier League with a match-winning all-round performance against Kolkata. After his quickfire 34 took   past the 170 mark, his spell of 3-19 ensured the team went over the line. He was also electric in the field with two catches and run-out. 
Following Rashid's remarkable performance and Team Hyderabad's entry to the finals, an elated Mahesh Babu took to Twitter to congratulate the team. 
 
 "Take a bow @rashidkhan_19... Whatta match by @SunRisers 👏Can't wait for Sunday!!! Congratulations to the whole team. 😊
 Go #OrangeArmy #SRH (sic)," the actor posted on Twitter. 
 
 
  
 And then the unexpected happened. While acknowledging Mahesh, Rashid also stated that he watches his movies regularly. 
 "Thank you bro 🙌🏻🙌🏻 watching your movies keenly 😊 (sic)," Rashid replied. Looks like his stint with the Sunrisers franchise has turned Rashid Khan into a true blue Hyderabadi.
