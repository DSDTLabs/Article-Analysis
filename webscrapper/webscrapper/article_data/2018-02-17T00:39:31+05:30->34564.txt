Chennai: Under what law can the court order removal of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s portrait from the  , was the question posed by the Madras   on a plea moved by   seeking the relief.

 Though in my personal opinion it is not right to display portraits of convicted persons in public offices, how can the court interfere in the exclusive decision of the speaker of the assembly, Chief Justice Indira Banerjee asked. 
 
 The first bench comprising the Chief Justice and Justice Abdul Quddhose then said that they would pass orders on the plea on February 19.
 
 Earlier, senior counsel for DMK P Wilson had argued, “Jayalalithaa was pronounced guilty of corruption by the Supreme Court along with other convicts . In view of her demise, she was not sentenced and appeals against her were treated abated.” 
 
 In such circumstances, the DMK had already moved the high court seeking removal of Jayalalithaa’s photos from government offices. While the case is still pending, the speaker has allowed display of her portrait, Wilson added. Opposing the arguments, advocate-general Vijay Narayan submitted that Jayalalithaa was not convicted by the top court and that the portrait is erected as per the powers provided to the speaker.
