Panaji: Aam Aadmi Party state convener Elvis Gomes said that the recent remarks of BJP leader Subramaniam Swamy that Goa is on BJP's no beef radar, highlights the saffron party’s agenda of tinkering Goa’s way of life and people’s eating habits.  “We demand an immediate retort from the chief minister that his government will respect the socio-cultural reality of the state’s people,” Gomes said.  Swamy had recently commented on consumption of beef in Goa.
