Actor   reveals he developed a little bit of a crush on the former football star   when they worked together on 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword'. 

 In an interview with MR PORTER for this week's issue, the 36-year-old actor praised Beckham, saying his "work ethic just shone throughout the film".
 
  
  
 
 "David Beckham asked me my opinion a few times on different bits and bobs. I don't know if it was any help or not, but I was really blown away. It became very clear why and how Beckham's become the phenomenon that he has. Because he showed up determined to do a good job. 
 
 "He'd worked with a dialect coach, and maybe an acting coach. I sort of anticipated, well, he's a superstar. This is not his primary or even his secondary focus; this is just a bit of a giggle for him," Hunnam says. 
 
 He adds, "And that, combined with him just being humble and kind and accessible, was very endearing. I'm not a football man, so upfront, I didn't really have a strong feeling one or way or another. But by the time he left, I had a little bit of a crush on him. He was pretty cool." 
 
 Beckham has a cameo appearance in 'King Arthur: Legend of the Sword', which is coming to the US theaters on May 17. 
 
 The Guy Ritchie-directed movie also stars Jude Law as Vortigern,   as Uther Pendragon, Annabelle Wallis as Maid Maggie, and 'Game of Thrones' actor Aidan Gillen as Goosefat  .
