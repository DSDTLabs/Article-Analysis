CHENNAI: The syndicate of   of Madras on Thursday decided that professor T Santhanam, the former   of city-based D G Vaishnav college, cannot guide   students anymore.

 Santhanam was found to have plagiarised his research thesis ‘The validation of a computer simulation model using spectral analysis’, from the research publication of an American scholar. The university disapproved his principal post in December after a subject expert confirmed the  . The complaint was given by one Regina Vincent, a resident of Korattur.
 
 Now, the university stripped him of his guideship. “All students working under him will be withdrawn. They will have to find another guide. However, this will not affect students who have completed research under him,” said a top university official. The college, an affiliate of the university, had indicated that they would act as per the university’s directions.
 
 University sources said Santhanam was asked for an explanation before the syndicate meeting. He had sought details regarding the complaint and the subject expert who established the plagiarism. 
 
 Some syndicate members said there was no need to reveal such details to Santhanam once the charge was proved. “The subject expert found a high level of plagiarism,” a syndicate member said.
 
 The syndicate has also decided to remove professor Palanisamy as principal of the university’s constituent college in Thiruvottiyur. Audit reports objected to Palanisamy’s appointment made in July 2014-during vice-chancellor R Thandavan’s term, for not complying with UGC norms. 
 
 He did not have 15 years of teaching experience and was working in assistant professor cadre. “He will be shifted back to a department at the same cadre level,” the official said.
 
 The syndicate has also decided to roll back the hike in examination   by around 50% after reconsidering representations. For instance, the fee for a theory paper, which was hiked from Rs 65 to Rs 100, will be Rs 85.
