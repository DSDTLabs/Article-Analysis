JAIPUR: BJP’s national vice-president and in-charge of the party affairs in   Avinash Rai Khanna on Wednesday said that though the party had not performed well in the recent bypolls, but it will come back to power again because of its workers.

 “We are focusing at our grassroot workers, be it at the mandal or the booth level. There had been some disappointment among the workers but we are focusing on strengthening our basic structure. It is our workers who will ensure that the   regains power in the forthcoming assembly elections,’’ said Khanna, while addressing a press conference on Thursday. Khanna, for the past two days, had been presiding over a series of meetings with the party workers and office bearers at the state BJP headquarters.
 
 Claiming that bypoll results on the two Lok Sabha seats and an Assembly seat were a hard lesson learnt, the workers are back to working hard. He said that the result on 200 seats cannot be predicted over the party’s performance in these 17 seats as several factors involved. ``What is important is that, our workers are working with full dedication at the booth level. The party's MLAs and other elected representatives have been asked to take up the organisational works in a fast paced manner," he added.
 
 Khanna said the BJP's focus was on booth management because if the booth is strong, victory of the party is assured.
