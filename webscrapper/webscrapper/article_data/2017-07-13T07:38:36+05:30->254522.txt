BENGALURU: Motorists negotiating Bengaluru's potholeridden roads can soon look forward to less bumpy rides, at least on some stretches. The government plans to concretize 24 major roads in the next six months.

 With an eye on the 2018 polls, the cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal to develop 24 arterial roads spanning 53.67km with cement concrete at approximately Rs 250 crore.
 
 “White-topping of city roads will be taken up soon as part of the government's comprehensive plan to give a facelift to infrastructure in Bengaluru,“ said law and parliamentary affairs minister T B Jayachandra. With the city growing at a rapid pace and steep rise in vehicle population, there is a need to widen major roads and ensure they are pothole-free, he pointed out.
 
 “Tenders will be floated soon,“ said N Manjunath Prasad, BBMP commissioner. The state will provide funds worth Rs 600 crore to the BBMP for execution of the work. 10,000 pourakarmikas to be regularized The cabinet also approved a proposal to regularize the services of 10,000 contract pourakarmikas in the next three months. Jayachandra said contract civic workers who are getting a monthly salary of Rs 17,000 will be paid Rs 25,000 after regularization. He said salaries of other contract workers will directly be credited to their accounts by the municipal corporations.
 
 A total of 20,000 pourakarmikas are employed on contract basis by various civic bodies across the state. The services of 10,000 pourakarmikas, including 4,000 working for the BBMP, will be regularized in the first phase and the rest subsequently, he added.
