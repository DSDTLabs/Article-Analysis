MUMBAI: The state government has said that “no concessions have been given by either the Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority ( ) or the government while preparing, implementing and approving a   for a specific category of high court judges”.

 The   on Thursday had asked whether a person who may already have got a house under a government scheme could opt for a house under another government scheme. 
 
 Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said that under the law a specific permissible category of persons under Regulation 13(2) of Mhada rules for   was created.
 
 The high court was hearing a   (PIL) filed by a former journalist,  , challenging a proposed residential high-rise for high court judges in Oshiwara.
 
 The state sought dismissal of the PIL with exemplary costs. It said the PIL not only lacks merits, its language is also questionable and is “offensive and derogatory’’ and it is “uncalled for’’.
 
 In its affidavit, the Mhada said its rules of 1981 governing disposal of land allows for housing schemes to be developed and implemented for a “specific category or categories”, with approval of the government.
 
 In 2007, the state, in a government resolution (GR), set out five categories, including judges working in Supreme Court, high court and other lower courts. In 2011, to leave “no ambiguity” it prescribed a procedure to be followed while implementing the policy, it said. In 2015, the state clarified through another GR that the specific category would be “collectively and/or for specific cadre of judges”.
 
 Mhada said it means that a housing scheme could be prepared by it for high court judges. The high court was informed that an advertisement is contemplated only to make beneficiaries of such schemes aware of its implementation and not for calling objections and suggestions, as wrongly understood by the petitioner.
