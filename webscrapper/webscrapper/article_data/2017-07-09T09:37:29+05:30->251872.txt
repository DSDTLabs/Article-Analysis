CHENNAI: On Saturday, Karthik Dhandapani and his family celebrated, complete with a ‘doggy’ cake, to mark the bringing home, exactly a year ago, of  , the mongrel flung off a rooftop by two medical students.

 “It was at dusk of this day last year, I was taking Bhadra home from Shravan’s place. Just few minutes into the drive, our first kiss happened! Little did I know then, she is going to be my lil girl… What amazes me is the trust she has on humans even after what she went through,” posted Karthik on Facebook.
  
  
 
 
 The video of the mongrel being flung off surfaced on social media last July and went viral. Within hours the perpetrators were identified as Madha Medical College students   and Ashish Paul and an FIR registered. The mongrel, later named Bhadra, survived the fall with a couple of fractures, and was rescued by animal welfare activists, including   Krishnan, Antony Rubin and Jennifer Jacob.
 
 The incident shocked the nation, and Dhandapani, a Blue Cross of India volunteer, came forward to foster the five-month pup.
 
 “My mother was not fine with a pet as it is a lifelong commitment. But I persuaded her as the vet had advised complete rest for Bhadra,” says Dhandapani.
 
 The initial days were a little tough. “I had to carry her around as the vet had restricted movement but even then her spirit was there... ,” he says.
 
 Today, Bhadra is the darling of the household. “She is very healthy, active and naughty too,” laughs Dhandapani. Bhadra has also bonded with his mother and has no fear playing on the terrace of their Ramapuram home. The case against the medicos is still pending in court.
