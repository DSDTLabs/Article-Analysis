LONDON: British police today made a sixth arrest in connection with the kidnapping and murder of Indian- origin jeweller  , who was found dead in Leicester last week.

 The family also urged anyone with information about the attack to contact police so that people responsible for his death can be caught.
 
 Jogiya's body was recovered from   area of Leicester. A murder investigation was launched and initial enquiries had established that he had been pulled into a vehicle and taken against his will from Belgrave Road.
