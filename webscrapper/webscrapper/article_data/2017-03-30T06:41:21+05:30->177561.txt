 The new tourist destination will have around 23 cottages and one restaurant to offer a relaxing holiday trip to visitors. It will also have recreational facilities like water sports, surfing and a cruise boat to attract tourists. 
 
 The department also had plans to provide houseboat facility for tourists. They had planned to develop two house boats at Hanuwantiya Island and then shift one of them to Sailani Island. However, owing to height and weight of these houseboats, the department changed its decision.
