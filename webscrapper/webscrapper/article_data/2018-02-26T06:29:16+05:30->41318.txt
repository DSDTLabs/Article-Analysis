MUMBAI: The opposition on Sunday boycotted the customary tea party ahead of the  , which starts on Monday. 

 “The Fadnavis government has been unable to tackle the agrarian crisis. The law and order situation has collapsed, there is no end to farmer suicides, the loan waiver scheme has failed to take off. Like Narendra Modi, Fadnavis is busy in promoting his own brand. His claims on investments and employment generation are hollow. We will expose the government,’’ said leader of the opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil.
 
 Vikhe-Patil, leader of the opposition in the council Dhananjay Munde, former chief minister Prithrivaj Chavan, PWP’s Jayant Patil, NCP leaders Ajit Pawar and Sunil Tatkare held a meeting to draft strategy. 
 
 On the loan waiver scheme, Vikhe-Patil said as on February 7, less than 19 lakh farmers have been benefited by the scheme. On the Make-in-India and Magnetic   conclaves, he said while the results of the first summit were not visible, the second conference quietly projected the CM. “The CM has promised 35 lakh jobs, my suggestion is that first he should fill up 1.7 lakh vacant government posts.” He said there was no progress in Dr Ambedkar and Shivaji memorials. He added that even as crops in Vidarbha and Marathwada have been destroyed owing to unseasonal rains, no steps have been taken to tackle farmers’ woes.
