Panaji:   Party (GFP) has objected to the presentation of the Union Budget, a few weeks before the assembly elections to be held in Goa and four other states in the country. 

  GFP has dashed a representation to the chief election commissioner to issue necessary instructions to ensure that the election code of conduct enunciated by the election commission of India is implemented in content and spirit.
 
  The presentation of the budget would be a mockery of the code, as it is only the ruling party which gets the opportunity to announce schemes and programmes with an eye on the electorate, states the representation. 
 
  “This demolishes the claims of free and fair conduct of elections and providing a level playing field to all political parties and contesting candidates,” GFP president Prabhakar Timble said, in the representation addressed to the chief election commissioner.
 
  If the election commission of India remains quiet on the budget issue, it would be offering an opportunity to the ruling party for institutional rigging of elections. “The sops would amount to inducement, almost akin to bribery,” Timble alleged.
