Gaya: Heavily armed Maoists blew up the control cabin of a 25MW solar power plant and set ablaze its security guard cabin under the Amas police station area of the district on Monday night. The plant is spread over 120 acre area. Early estimates put the loss at about Rs70 lakhs. However, the three employees deputed there escaped unhurt. 

  SSP Garima Malik said no notes/leaflets were recovered from the spot. Asked whether the blast was related to any dispute between the power company management and the Maoists on the issue of ‘levy’ (extortion money) payment, the SSP said the company management never complained of any extortion demand made by the Maoists.
 
 No arrest has been made so far in this connection, said the SSP. Sources said the blast might have been engineered by the Maoists to register their presence in the Sherghati subdivision of the district. They have been engaged in a battle with police forces and CRPF for turf domination in the region. The Maoists have got somewhat weakened in the region on account of improved connectivity and police mobility.
