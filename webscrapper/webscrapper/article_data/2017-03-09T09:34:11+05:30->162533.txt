SURAT: Tapi purification plan is proposed to be carried out by the city-based Green Design and Engineering company in three phases from Kakrapar to   (SUDA) limits and after that along the course of the river passing through the areas under the jurisdiction of Surat Municipal Corporation. The thrust of the five-year plan is recycle and reuse polluted water of the river. 

 “We have taken up this exercise under National River Cleaning Programme (NRCP) of Central Government. We need to reuse and re-release the water in the river itself. The implementation of the plan would begin once it is approved by the authorities concerned,” municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said. 
 
 The first phase from Kakrapar to SUDA area means a majority of the villages will be covered. Kadod, Mandvi, Vareli, Bodhan, Karjan, Dhoran and Dhoran Pardi villages release around 34 million litre per day (MLD) of water laced with impurities, mostly sewage, into the river. Industries on this stretch release effluents containing nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium into Tapi.
 
 The second part will cover the whole of SUDA area from where nearly 124 MLD of water flows into the river. Kamrej, Kholwad, Valak, Kathor and many other villages are located here. There are a number of industries also in this stretch. Industrial effluents and sewage flow into the river from this stretch. 
 
 The third phase will cover areas under Surat Municipal Corporation. An infestation of human habitation along the riverbank means collection of waste flowing into the river. Then there is this problem of open sewerage outlets and illegal pipelines bringing industrial effluents into the river. There are around 68 open outlets of SMC alone releasing waste into the river. 
 
 However, SMC officials claimed only 24 were functional but they released 66 MLD of impure water into the river. Cowsheds along the riverbank at Katargam and Varachha areas were also responsible for propelling a lot of impurities into the river.
