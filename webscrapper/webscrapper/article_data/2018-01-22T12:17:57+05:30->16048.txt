NEW DELHI: One of the measures of   is   (  and  ) as percentage of GDP. In 1990, trade accounted for only 15 per cent of India’s GDP, nearly half of China’s trade-GDP ratio. But the picture now is very different. In 2016, India’s trade had risen to nearly 40 per cent of GDP, whereas it was only 37.05 per cent in the case of China, and this despite a slight drop in trade. 

 Of course, in the case of China, trade peaked at 63 per cent of GDP before falling again, reflecting a change in the structure of the economy towards being more driven by domestic demand. Wonder what finance minister Arun Jaitley has in store in   to give a leg up to both trade and domestic consumption?
