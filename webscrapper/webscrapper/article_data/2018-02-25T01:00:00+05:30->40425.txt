Hearsay is that  , who has received rave reviews for her portrayal of a Rajput queen in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ' ', is currently under a house arrest of sorts. Before you think otherwise, the actress has been unwell for some time now and has been advised bed rest. When BT enquired about the issue, we found that Deepika had borne back injuries while shooting for the period drama.
 
 Though she didn’t have action scenes to perform, the weight of her clothes and jewellery seem to have affected her back. The pain, which had subsided with the help of medication back then, has aggravated now. “Deepika has been advised to stay at home as much as possible and not strain her back. She’s not even allowed to wear heels or be on her feet for too long. Her mother   was with her briefly a few days ago, and is expected to make another visit. Deepika will have to stay off duty for at least a month before she can hit the studio floors again,” says a source close to the actress. 
 
 Given the pain, Deepika has even turned down several public appearances, including a fashion and beauty award show. Her injury was also one of the reasons filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj’s film, featuring   and her, was pushed ahead.
