MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Wednesday ordered statutory notice to the   municipality commissioner P   and   police inspector S Prithiviraj to appear before court in a contempt case filed by former minister V Senthilbalaji.

 A division bench headed by justice M   heard the case. The petitioner’s side told the court that the former minister wanted permission to conduct sport events and public meetings at Thiruvalluvar Maithanam, Karur from January 27 to 29 in which R K Nagar MLA T T V Dhinakaran is expected to participate. For that, the petitioner submitted representations to the inspector and municipality commissioner on December 27 last. As they failed to respond to the representation, the petitioner filed a case before the high court bench.
 
 The court on January 19 passed order saying that the petitioner vehemently submitted that on account of political rivalry, permission had been unjustly denied, but the court was not inclined to go into the submission and it directed the respondents to process the application before January 23.
 
 But, the municipality disobeyed the order and on January 23, it passed an order refusing permission by stating that it preferred a special leave petition before the   against the high court order. The municipality’s action was nothing, but to satisfy the political command by the ruling party. Hence, it was necessary to stay the municipality’s order refusing permission and to direct the officials to give permission to hold events and meeting from the scheduled date.
 
 Following it, the court ordered statutory notice.
