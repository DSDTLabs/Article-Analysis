LUCKNOW: With  , including  ,  ,  , technical, electrical, guards and kitchen staff on strike, chaos continued for the second consecutive day at Rani Laxmi Bai (RLB) combined hospital in Rajajipuram on Tuesday.

 Demanding wages that have not been given to them for the last eight months, workers on Tuesday also alleged that the administration had snapped the power supply of the hospital, throwing services off track. The administration, on the other hand, claimed otherwise and threatened action against those contractual employees who had cut the electricity for over two hours on Tuesday.
 
 The employees are also demanding assurance from the administration against alleged suspension of employees without any reason.With no conclusive talks between the two parties, the employees have threatened to go on an indefinite strike from work until the issue is resolved. With over 68 employees on strike, OPD services at the hospital remained affected, delaying two surgeries scheduled for the day. Amid the chaos, there were also reports of death of a newborn that parents claimed was due to negligence of the hospital, failing to refer the newborn to another hospital within time and arranging an ambulance for the transfer.
 
 Refusing to comment on the issue, Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr GS Bajpai said that the hospital is an independent unit not under the CMO. The office of the medical superintendent at RLB remained locked all day long and efforts to reach him on call remained inconclusive.
