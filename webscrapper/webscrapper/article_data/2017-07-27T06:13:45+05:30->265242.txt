PUNE: Flyers will have to wait till the next monsoon for three new   at the Lohegaon airport.

 This  , most passengers will have to go through the ordeal of walking up the aircraft amid showers and bear with  . An airport official told TOI, “The construction work of aerobridges is in progress and they will be operational by   2018.”
 
 The fresh deadline goes against what was promised last year by the   Advisory Committee in mid-October. 
 
 The committee chairman, Anil Shirole, had then said the aerobridges from the terminal building to the aircraft would be completed by this year.
 
 A text message sent to MP Shirole remained unanswered. In the absence of adequate number of aerobridges, most airlines are forced to make their passengers walk up to the aircraft. It is a hassle for flyers in monsoon.
 
 Another airport official said, “We understand that aerobridges are important. We want the bridges to be constructed in the best way possible. We had not talked about any deadline and can only say that the work is on.”
 
 On July 24, Ashish Kanodia complained to the Jet Airlines that his trolley bags were handled shabbily. He said, “There was some minor damage to the objects inside. The worst part was the luggage was wet with the contents.”
 
 The same day another passenger complained with the same airline that he got drenched while boarding an aircraft. On July 20, another passenger tweeted about passengers walking on the wet tarmac towards an IndiGo aircraft in the late evening hours. 
 
 “You simply have to walk up to the plane at Pune airport. The rain had stopped when we started boarding but I guess there were umbrellas for the passengers,” he tweeted.
