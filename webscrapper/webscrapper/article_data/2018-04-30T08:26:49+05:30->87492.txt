MUMBAI: Mumbaikars are never satisfied with the quality of civic services, and for valid reasons. But here is a piece of good news. The quality of municipal water that is supplied to homes has improved by a decent margin.

 
  
  
 
 According to an internal report by the BMC, the percentage of water unfit for human consumption has dropped to under 1.4% from 3.1% last year.
 
 The report gives a wardwise break-up of water quality, mentioning the percentage of unfit water samples.
 
 Crucially, the suburbs of Mumbai score over the southern parts of the city. Wards with the most unfit water include A, which is where areas like   and Churchgate lie. At this ward, the percentage of unfit water samples was found to be 5.2%. B ward, which includes parts of   and  , had a better showing (just over 3.6%). The wards with the highest quality of BMCsupplied water are all in the north of the city: P-North (Malad), R-South (Kandivli, Charkop, Poisar), S (Bhandup), T (Mulund), H-East ( ). In these wards, the percentage of unfit water was found to be below 1, with it being just 0.25% in  .
 
 Statistics from 2012-13 onwards show marked improvements in the quality of municipal water year on year. For instance, the percentage of unfit water samples was 17 in 2012-13, which dropped to 10.8 in 2013-14, and then dramatically to 4.4 in 2014-15. Civic officials attribute this to the replacement of Britishera pipelines in the city.
 
 But corporators say that the reality at some places is quite different from the pretty picture painted by the BMC’s water quality statistics. Bandra corporator   said that the slums, which is where over half the city’s population live, always complain of contaminated water, especially during the first few minutes of supply. Goregaon corporator   said contamination complaints are received from areas where water pressure is low.
 
 Of course, residents of housing societies say the situation in their buildings has markedly improved over the years.
