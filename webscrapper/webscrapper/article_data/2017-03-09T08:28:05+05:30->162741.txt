KALPETTA: The sexual abuse of seven minor girls, inmates of a hostel of   Muslim orphanage, has exposed the lapses by orphanage authorities, who did not ensure proper care.

 Around 250 students, some with learning difficulties, are staying in the orphanageâ€™s hostel that is just 500m away from the campus. It is alleged that students come to school in morning and return by evening, without any assistance from orphanage caretakers.
 
 Orphanage authorities claim that they have appointed seven counsellors and the orphanage has appointed a   officer for every 25 students. But, questions arise how the children were trapped by a group of youngsters and raped every day at a small shop in front of the main gate of the orphanage for past three months.
 
 According to police the children were abused by the accused, between 4pm and 4.30pm after school. The spokesperson of the orphanage TM Rasheed ruled out the allegation that students were taken to orphanage from hostel late in the evening, without any supervision, for dinner and studies. The claim was that this was done since the hostel lacked much facilities. Rasheed refuted this too.
 
 But, shop owners and school teachers said that all students were taken to the orphanage around 7pm on many days and they were seen returning back by 9pm as there were no proper facilities to provide food at the hostel.
