The   assured an Italian, who had left for   with his seven-year-old  , that no prosecution will be initiated against him if he brings her back. The man is involved in a custody battle with his estranged wife. 

 In 2010, the couple had secured joint guardianship of the child from an adoption centre in Pune. They split later and in 2013, a Pune family court granted the child's custody to the husband.
 
 The wife challenged the family court's order in the HC, and while the matter was pending, he left for   with the child in 2015. "The wife lodged an FIR with Yerawada police, accusing him of abducting her daughter," sub-inspector D R Hemade told TOI on Tuesday. 
 
 Following the HC's directions, efforts were made to locate the man and his daughter. The absence of an extradition treaty between India and Italy seemed an impediment in bringing him back with the child.
 
 On March 21, a bench of Justices V M Kanade and A S Gadkari was informed that Italian police had contacted the man in February, and that he and his daughter were living in Verona, where the minor was registered at a school.
 
 The bench was informed that, on the basis of a reference made by the Indian Consulate in Rome, a file was opened at the public prosecutor's office in the juvenile court of Venice on December 5, 2016.
