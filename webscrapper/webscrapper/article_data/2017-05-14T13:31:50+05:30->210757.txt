KOLKATA: Love, care, attention, responsibility...we relate a mother to all these words but we often ignore the fact that they, too, have a child in them and mothers love to indulge it. And mothers’ interests are often just as youthful or juvenile as their children.

 Take, for instance, 35-year-old Runa, an accomplished entrepreneur who has been recognised internationally as an architecture. She loves collecting cartoon T-shirts. “There are times when it becomes hard to focus on my little one’s shopping, especially when there are these new T-shirts with   and Bugs Bunny faces grinning on. I end up getting them for myself,” chuckled the mother. 
 
 Fifty-three-year-old Sumita   recalls the day when her daughter coaxed her into watching Kung-fu Panda 3. The contest between the two characters left her mesmerized. “I was initially reluctant but ended up biting my nails in apprehension during the climax. I have to admit it was engrossing.” 
 
 Ishita Mukherjee, 32, is the mom who will overlook your report card if you bring her balloons. “I have a fascination for balloons. Every time I go out with my family, I try to get one under the pretext of getting it for my son,” she grinned.  , a 25-year-old homemaker and mother of a toddler, has a habit of keeping anything new near her pillow when she goes to bed. “Be it a pair of shoes or a new sari, it has to be near my pillow. I don’t know why I do it. It’s just that it gives me immense joy. It may sound child like , but what is the harm in being so?” The last sentence she said triggered a spur of thoughts. What is the harm indeed ? What’s so weird in still being excited at the look of a beautifully wrapped present or collecting action figures? What's the harm in celebrating one very beautiful aspect of being a woman, without confining it to stereotyped expectations? How about making it about being herself, than making it just about being mom?
