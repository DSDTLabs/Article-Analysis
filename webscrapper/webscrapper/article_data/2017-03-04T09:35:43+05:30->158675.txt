INDORE: A day after a video recording of   leader Kundan Chandrawat’s speech announcing a bounty of Rs 1 crore on the head of Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan went viral, he was stripped of his duties as the Sangh’s Ujjain mahanagar sah-prachar pramukh on Friday.

 Chandrawat, however, claimed that he will continue to be a part of the RSS till he breathes his last.
 
 “Confusion has been created due to Kundan ji Chandrawat’s speech at a dharna by Jan Adhikar Samiti in Ujjain. Therefore, he is relieved of his duties with the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh; however, Kundan ji Chandrawat has expressed regret over his comments and has withdrawn it,” RSS prant sanghchalak Dr Prakash Shastri announced in a release here. Shastri also made it clear that Chandrawat’s statements do not reflect the RSS's official stand.
 
 Chandrawat had held Kerala chief minister Vijayan responsible for the alleged killing of over 300 RSS workers in the southern state and offered to hand over his property worth over Rs 1 crore to "whoever beheads Vijayan and brings his head."
 
 When contacted by TOI, Chandrawat said that he was yet to receive an official comunication from the Sangh about the decision to strip him of his duties. “If such a decision is taken, I will accept it wholeheartedly. I will always remain a part of RSS till I breath my last.” He claimed that the RSS does not have anything like a "membership" or "registration."
 
 The Sangh leadship, however, distanced itself from the ousted activist's claim. Ujjain mahanagar pramukh Samir Choudhari said, “Whether Chandrawat remains associated with the RSS (ideology) is entirely his decision.”
