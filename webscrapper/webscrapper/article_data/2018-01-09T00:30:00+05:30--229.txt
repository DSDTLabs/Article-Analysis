Bengaluru: Bandepalya police in southeast Bengaluru on Monday questioned six office bearers of the ND Sepal Apartment Association in connection with the death of three workers in a sewage treatment plant (STP) at the apartment complex. A case of death due to negligence under Section 304A of IPC has been registered against one of the deceased, Narayanaswamy, and the apartment’s association. Police said Narayanaswamy, 38, a resident of Kaikondarahalli and an electrician, had got a contract to maintain the motor pump at the STP. He also took contract for cleaning the STP but never ensured preventive measures while doing so. He enlisted his friends, Mahadeva Gowda, 40, and Srinivas, 55, both residents of Somasundara Palya, for the job on Sunday. “Narayanaswamy did not take any precaution when he and his friends entered the STP,” sources said. Narayanaswamy has been named the first accused in the FIR registered on the basis of a complaint lodged by Manjula, wife of Mahadeva Gowda. “Prima facie, the negligence of Narayanaswamy and the apartment association led to the tragedy,” a police officer said. M B Boralingaiah, deputy commissioner of police (southeast division), said: “We’ll find out whose negligence led to the tragic incident in the further course of investigation and take action against them.”  The office bearers claimed that they were not aware why the trio entered the STP as they had not asked them to clean it. “We’ve given contract to Narayanaswamy to maintain motor pumps of the STP. We never asked him to clean the plant and we don’t know why they entered there,” they told police.
