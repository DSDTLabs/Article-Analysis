Summer is here and the season also brings with it a variety of activities — both outdoor and indoor. Of course, for some, it also is the time to recall nostalgic childhood memories. Kudla’s celebrities share their favourite summer timepass with us...

  For me, summer is all about being around water. Whether it is multiple showers at home or diving into the water at the many beaches in Kudla. Of course, there are times when summer brings back nostalgic memories of my grandmother’s home in Kundapur where we would indulge in simple pleasures of life like listening to the radio with our grandfather. The hot sun meant staying indoors and all of us cousins were made to listen to the news followed by old Kannada film songs. I’d give my right arm to relive those days.

    is always about beaches in the summer time. After staying indoors all day, we head to the beach in the evenings and stay there until late night. The joy of swimming in the sea during summer is a joy that can’t be explained in words.

  Right next to our house in Kundapur is a river and that is where I head to whenever I’m in ooru during summer. The other thing we do this season is to forage for fruits in the forest bordering our home. We also have a huge mango tree in front of our home and in the afternoons, when these fruits fall off, we rush to bring them home and make a variety of goodies out of them.

  Everybody knows that summers are harsh in Mangaluru, so I always stay indoors during this time. But it is also the time when I bring to the fore all my craftmaking skills that were picked up in school. Glass painting is a favourite. Another favourite activity is fishing. I still fondly recall the fishing trips we went on during childhood. The group has gotten smaller, but the fun quotient stays the same.
