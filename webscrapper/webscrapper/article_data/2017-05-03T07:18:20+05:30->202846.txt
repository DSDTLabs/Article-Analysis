KOLKATA:   seems to be the latest popular neighbourhood on people's  . 

 The clamour for owning a property in the satellite township was evident from the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) receiving 4,331 applications for 75 residential plots, each ranging from 2 cottah to 6 cottah, to be distributed through lottery. Among them, 3,497 candidates want to buy small individual plots and 834 hope to set up cooperative societies. Government officials pointed out that small   in New Town were being distributed after a gap of almost eight years and that they were primarily meant for high- and middle-income group residents. 
 
 The current   will be applicable.
 
 Another 25 plots, ranging from 4 cottah to 6 cottah, will be given out through e-auction, the process for which will be held only after the 75 residential plots are given out through lottery. "The lottery to allot the 75 residential plots will take place in June. After that, e-auction for the other 25 plots will be held. The authorities have kept the date for the 25 bigger plots later so that those missing out on the 75 plots can go in for the e-auction subsequently," said a senior Hidco official.
 
 After 2008-when the Left was in charge of the state-the Mamata Banerjee government last year decided to distribute 100 small residential plots in October last year, given the huge demand for land. The authorities said they were also trying to ensure work started on all the vacant plots, which had been allotted long ago.
