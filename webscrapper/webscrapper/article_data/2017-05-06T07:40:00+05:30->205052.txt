GUWAHATI: Thousands of women Anganwadi workers are on strike in the state over the last four days demanding hikes in their remunerations. The Citu-affiliated Assam   has threatened to intensify the stir scheduled till May 9 in protest against non-fulfilment of their eight-point demand charter focussed on providing social security to their families. The women activists staged a protest near   on Friday demanding fulfilment of their demands without delay. 

 "The Anganwadi workers and helpers remained patient after chief minister   assured us that the state government would look into their grievances. Ever since the presentation of the state budget in February, several rounds of talks were held at bureaucratic and ministerial levels on the demands but they couldn't yield any fruitful results," said secretary of the association, Indira Newar.
 
 Anguished over the "meagre" pay offered to the Anganwadi workers and helpers engaged in over 62 thousand Anganwadi centres of the state, the association hit out at the state government for not paying due attention to their cause. The Anganwadi workers who train children have been receiving monthly remuneration of Rs 4,000, while the helpers of the centres, who assist the workers, get Rs 2,000 per month. The association has been demanding an additional Rs 3,500 for the helpers and extra remuneration of Rs 5,000 for the Anganwadi workers. "Is it possible to run our families with monthly remuneration of less than Rs 5,000 at at a time when the prices of the essential commodities are soaring every year? Is it justice," questioned Newar.
