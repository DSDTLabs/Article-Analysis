NEW DELHI: Delhi University, on the order of Delhi  , has admitted a student into Law Centre 2 by converting a vacant ST seat into a   one. 

 The student, Manmeet Kaur Sareen, had filed a plea in HC, seeking  , arguing that there were vacancies even after the final cutoff admissions were complete. 
 
 Court records said Sareen had secured 231 marks in her LLB entrance exam and was placed 1,342 in the rankings. The last cutoff for   in the unreserved category was 233-34. She had submitted that even after taking in those students, there were still vacant seats. 
 
 DU, on September 11, filed an affidavit, stating that there were 14 vacant seats in the three law centres. In Law Centre 2, there were seven seats in the Scheduled Tribes quota and one for foreign national. The university said that these seats wouldn’t be carried forward to the next academic year or converted to the unreserved category. 
 
 The university rule for admission to reserved category states: “The seats reserved for SC/ST shall be filled by SC/ST candidates only. However, in case of non-availability of the eligible candidates, the reserved seats may be interchanged between the SC and ST. If still any seats remain unfilled, the same shall be left vacant.”
 
 But Justice Indermeet Kaur granted relief to Sareen and observed, “The ends of justice would definitely not be served if available seats in educational institutions are allowed to go waste; this could also not have been the intention of educational legislators...This would be a denial of opportunity to an otherwise meritorious student…” 
 
 The court ordered that one of the eight vacant seats be converted into a general one and Sareen taken in. 
 
 At this,   said there were other candidates who had scored higher than Sareen—there were 67 more candidates who scored between 231 and 234. But the court noted that Sareen was the only person to come to court for relief. 
 
 University officials said Sareen was admitted on Monday.
