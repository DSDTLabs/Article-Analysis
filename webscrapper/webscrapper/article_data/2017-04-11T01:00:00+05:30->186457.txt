 has been missing from the small screen for a while now. That’s because the actress, who is best known as Kajal bhai from ' ', has been busy behind the scenes. Bhairavi turned producer along with director   a few years ago, but acting is very much on her mind. “I will never quit acting,” she says adding, “It’s just that I stopped getting offers a couple of years ago. I guess people thought I didn’t want to act as I was making my own shows. But now, I have started getting offers again, so I may take up something in the near future. I am particular that it will have to be something different and interesting.” 
For the moment though, her entire focus is on the rape track in her show ' ' (a remake of the Turkish show 'Fatmagul'). “The track highlights the issue of rape. It’s about how a woman is treated after rape — the pain that she has to go through yet again. Rape is perhaps the only crime where the victim is made to feel like the culprit,” she says.
