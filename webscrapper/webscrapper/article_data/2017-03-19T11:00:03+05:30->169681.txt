NAGPUR: Underscoring the need to implement and focus on rationalization of tax structure — a new system was passed in 2014-2015 — and making   (NMC) a Smart City, municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar presented Rs1,707.90 crore civic budget for the 2017-18 fiscal before the Standing Committee. He also scaled down the   budget for 2016-17 by almost Rs410 crore — from Rs2,048.02 crore to Rs1,636.63 crore. 

 “This time the budget has three components. First, it contains details of NMC’s income and expenditure. Second, pertains to the transport budget related to city bus service and third, concerns water supply and sewage treatment in city. I wish to concentrate on improving civic infrastructure, delivering quality services and improving quality of education in NMC-run schools,” Hardikar said on Saturday after presenting a copy of the budget to   chairman Sandip Jadhav. 
 
 Though Hardikar proposed no new tax, the 2017-18 budgetary proposals glaringly highlight the NMC’s heightened dependency on government aid. He put an estimated 55.12% NMC revenue as government grants. 
 
 The income of the local body is likely to get a boost from hiked Property Tax rate, BOT projects and the Orange City Street Project. 
 
 Commenting on goods and services tax (GST) roll-out, the commissioner said that it was expected from July 1 but the NMC was not yet clear about how much grant it would receive from the central government as it had not received any communication to this effect. “The NMC expects Rs1,065 crore grant once GST come into force,” the civic chief said. “I also expect Rs740 crore state grant in lieu of LBT in the next financial year.”
 
 In 2017-18, the NMC expects a revenue of Rs75 crore as LBT, Rs600 crore as LBT grants, property tax 340.34 crores, water tax Rs160 crore, Rs8.95 crore from the market department, Rs69.65 crore from town planning department and Rs112.58 crore from other heads.
 
 The civic chief pegged estimated expenditure in 2017-18 at Rs1,707.64 crore. This includes Rs339.33 crore on establishment, Rs132 crore on pension, Rs49.82 crore on administration, Rs247.47 crore on operations/maintenance/repairs, Rs382.05 crore as capital expenditure, Rs161.75 crore on ‘other heads’.
 
 Asked about the scaling down of the budget estimates for 2016-17 by Rs412 crore, Hardikar clarified that due to various reasons the NMC failed to meet the target set by the standing committee. He was quick to add that he did not notice any substantial increase in ‘revenue resources, recovery, new taxes and inherent competence’. 
 
 Hardikar also admitted that the lesser revenue generated has affected the smooth functioning of the NMC so much so that the civic body has been unable to pay salaries to its staff regularly. 
 
 “Till February end, the NMC’s income was Rs1,110 crore,” he said and added that the NMC will reach the revised target as it is expecting to receive over Rs500 crore from the state government. 
 
 To overcome the financial crunch, the civic chief said in the next financial year the NMC will focus on some austerity measures to curb unnecessary expenditure. “More road works will be carried out from NMC’s hotmix plants will be among some measures to curb excess expenditure,” he said.
 
 Replying to a question on his budget estimates for 2017-18, Hardikar said he expected more revenue and recovery in 2017-18. According to him, the introduction of pay and park will increase the civic body’s revenue by almost Rs8 crore per annum. Besides this, the NMC is also planning bio-mining of Bhandewadi dumping yard. 
 
 “If done, the NMC could commercially exploit around 100 acres of land in Bhandewadi area as it has got commercial potential,” he said.
 
 Replying to another query, “My focus will also be on improving quality of education in the civic run schools.” Besides this, the city will get at least 15 new gardens and parks across the city.
 
 Hardikar also emphasized on improving administrative functioning, enhancing dedication to work among officials and employees, preparing and implementing effectively ‘a plan for planned development’ of the city. 
 
 He also mentioned that implementation of 24X7 water supply had also affected due to lack of funds. As a result, the   — the private firm implementing the project — has demanded extension of the protection period, which ended early this year. “We have not yet accepted their demand. Now they will be paid on the basis of their performance,” he clarified.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner Ravindra Kumbhare, chief accounts and finance officer Madan Gadge, and other officers also were present at the press conference.
