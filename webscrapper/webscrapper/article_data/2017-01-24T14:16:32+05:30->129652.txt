VARANASI: Expelled   leader   said he was not afraid of chief minister   and he will not request the party's national president to withdraw his decision to expel him. 

 Addressing media persons at the Gadhwaghat Ashram, Singh said, "If I haven't said anything against the chief minister, it doesn't mean I am afraid of him. I am not his enemy. The only crime I committed, during my tenure in SP, was to be loyal to   only." The former SP leader was in Varanasi to attend the last rites of a saint.
 
 "I am being portrayed as a 'panauti (a trouble-maker) in media. I was held responsible for the feud in Ambani family. Then people alleged that I was behind the tiff between Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan. Now, again I am being blamed for the rift in the SP," he added.
 
 Taking a dig at SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav, Singh said, "I am thankful to Ram Gopal Yadav for issuing threats against me. After his threats, I got a high-security cover. Now, I am searching for a future in politics and will say something only after I have completed my search. Even when I am out of the party, people are still wasting their energy by talking about me," said Singh.
