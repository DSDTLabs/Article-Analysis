MARGAO: Two mango trees precariously inclined towards the   village panchayat’s office in   were being cut down by workers on Tuesday evening, when they toppled onto power lines passing through the area, disrupting electricity supply to over 20 households in the vicinity and severely inconveniencing residents.

 Irate villagers subsequently gathered near the panchayat office and confronted sarpanch Melvin  . 
 
 “The panchayat had sought permission from the forest department to cut down the two trees leaning towards the building and onto a nearby electricity pole, some months ago,” Sanches told TOI. 
 
 He also said that electricity department officials had been instructed to remove the overhead wires after the requisite clearances for the task were obtained. 
 
 “Power department officials, who were supervising the tree-cutting exercise, had asked the workers to postpone the work by a day, but they went ahead and cut the trees nonetheless, leading to the disruption in power supply,” he explained.
