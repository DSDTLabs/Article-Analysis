BATHINDA: The Muktsar district administration has enrolled former Delhi MLA and   (AAP) member Jarnail Singh as an eligible voter from Punjab, after agency reports stated Jarnail had confirmed to have  . He has been enrolled as a voter in the Lambi assembly constituency and registered as a resident of village Sarawan Bodla, falling in Lambi. Jarnail Singh’s vote in Delhi has been deleted. He has been fielded by AAP to take on Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal from Lambi in the February 4 assembly elections. The returning officer of Lambi assembly constituency Anmol Singh Dhaliwal confirmed that Jarnail Singh was enrolled as a voter on Friday.

 Jarnail, who gained prominence by hurling a shoe at the then union home minister P Chidambaram in 2009, had won the assembly election in February 2015 by defeating Manjinder Singh Sirsa of SAD by 10,036 votes. Earlier in the day, though reports of Jarnail Singh having resigned from his seat in Delhi assembly kept floating, Jarnail himself did not respond to various phone calls and text messages to confirm or deny it.
 
 AAP convener and Delhi chief minister   had, on December 28, announced Jarnail’s candidature from Lambi in a rally at village Kolianwali, falling in Lambi. Aiming to discard the tag of an outsider, AAP has used the term for Jarnail as ‘Punjab da Jarnail’ (General of Punjab) and ‘Badal nahi, badlav’ (not Badal, but change). “The claim of Jarnail Singh to enrol him as a voter was accepted on Friday. His name has been added in the voter list from Lambi assembly segment. His name will also figure in the Election Commission’s final list to be published on January 9,” said Lambi returning officer Anmol Singh, while speaking to TOI.
