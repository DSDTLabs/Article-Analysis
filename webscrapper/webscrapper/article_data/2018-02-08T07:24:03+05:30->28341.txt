BATHINDA/PATIALA: Hundreds of activists of seven farmer organisations disrupted traffic at several places in Punjab for two hours on Wednesday afternoon. The protesters took to the roads seeking implementation of the Punjab government’s pre-poll promise of complete farm debt waiver, Rs 5 lakh compensation to suicide-hit farm families, farm loans at low interest rates, rolling back the decision of putting electricity meters on tubewells and check on stray animals to save crops. 

 Activists of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), BKU (Ekta Dakaunda), Krantikari Kisan Union, Kirti Kisan Union, Kisan Sangharsh Committee, BKU (Krantikari) and Kisan Sangharsh Committee (Azad) held protests on Bathinda-Chandigarh highway, Barnala-Moga highway, Barnala-Ludhiana highway and in Muktsar, Mansa and Faridkot.
 
 BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said the   government has failed to fulfil its pre-poll promise of complete debt waiver. “We will continue with the protests till the government keeps its word. The farmers also want fair compensation to suicide victims’ families,” he added.
 
 They also blocked Chandigarh-Bathinda highway, near Patiala. Addressing the gathering, general secretary of BKU (Ekta Dakaunda)   said, “The Congress had made tall claims regarding complete debt waiver for farmers. But nothing has been done so far.”
 
 CM Captain   had promised that all loans, including the ones taken from nationalised or private banks, cooperative societies and commission agents, would be taken over by the state government. But the government has only announced a partial debt waiver that has left the farmers disappointed, he added.
