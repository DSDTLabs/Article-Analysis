NEW DELHI: Delhi government has written to a private school in   after complaints were received over arbitrary fee hikes by the school. According to officials, the school is built on   land with a lease rider that all fee hikes must be approved by the directorate of education. However, no such approval was sought, officials said, and that the fee had been increased to the tune of 25%.

 The school has, since then, rolled back the hiked fee.
 
 According to officials, deputy chief minister   wrote to the director of education on April 13 to look into the complaints of fee hike. Following this, a showcause notice was issued to the school on April 16 to explain the reasons for the arbitrary fee hike.
 
 In her reply, the school principal said she had sought directions of the higher authorities, and later rolled back the hike. 
 
 She said the school had stopped accepting hiked fees from parents and a notice had also been put up. The school sought more time to explain the need for a hiked fee.
 
 The school principal could not be reached for comment.
 
 The government also wrote to a private school in south Delhi for not admitting a   student whose name had appeared in the draw of lots and had been assigned the given school. The child has, since then, been admitted to the school.
