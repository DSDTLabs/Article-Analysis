Trichy: A group of transgenders along with social workers came together to remove eucalyptus trees from around 2 acres of land in Pudukkottai on Thursday. The aim of the exercise was to get rid of the exotic species which were responsible for the water crisis in Pudukkottai.  The group which gathered at Thuvar Kendayanpatti village removed over 500 trees that were over a year old. While a sapling was planted for the removal of each eucalyptus tree, Hasina, a transgender from Pudukkottai who was also part of the initiative, said that they ‘apologized’ to nature for reducing the green cover but this was essential for the good of Pudukkottai. They also sang traditional songs seeking rain to make the land fertile and improve the ground water table. The land belonged to one Vinod Kumar who worked in an IT company in Coimbatore. He had volunteered to remove the trees from his land after a social media initiative creating awareness on these invasive trees.  “Once surplus with water, especially because of a large number of ponds, Pudukkottai is one of the parched districts of Tamil Nadu. All this happened after eucalyptus trees were grown in large numbers,” says S Niyaz, a youth from the district. Like-minded people came together though social media and formed a group called “Porantha Ooruku Pughalai Thedu”, which meant : bring glory to your birth place.  When they approached the Pudukkottai collector seeking steps to remove the trees that the forest department was growing on thousands of acres, he pointed to the trees growing in large numbers on private land and asked why blame the government alone.  “We then decided to make it a public movement which would eventually make the administrators take steps,” said Niyaz. It was then that Vinod came forward agreeing to remove the trees from his land. “We are sure that many people would come forward to remove these trees which fetch money when grown to a considerable height but cause equal damage to the ecosystem,” he said.
