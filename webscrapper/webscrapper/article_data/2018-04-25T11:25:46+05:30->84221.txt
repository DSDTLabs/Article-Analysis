HYDERABAD: With the bogus extension of temporary registration ( ) certificates' row embroiled in controversy, local gazetted headmasters, who also hold additional charge of deputy education officer or deputy inspection officer posts (DyEO/DyIO), have decided to give up their additional posts. Claiming that they were not aware that fake ETRs were issued, they alleged they were being   committed by higher authorities. 

  "There are procedural lapses in issuing ETR/PTO (permission to open). There has been no official communication to field officers (FOs) as to which schools were issued ETR/PTO," said  , secretary,  . 
 
 "Irrespective of whether we send a proposal or not, higher officials issue ETR/PTO. In some cases even if we state that a school should not be issued ETR, they do not follow guidelines and still grant permission," said Laxman Singh, DyEO, Saidabad.
