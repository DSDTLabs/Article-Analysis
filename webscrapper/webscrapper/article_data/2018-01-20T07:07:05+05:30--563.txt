BENGALURU: The highly polluted   in southeast Bengaluru has caught fire, once again. Around 10am Friday, citizens living around the lake reported a fire close to the banks, and huge clouds of smoke hovering over the 950-acre waterbody.

 Fire tenders were pressed into action, but firemen couldn’t manoeuvre to the spot where the fire and smoke was emanating from. The fire started spreading to the banks, fuelled by dry grass, garbage and other waste. Despite efforts by fire personnel and other volunteers, the blaze couldn’t be brought under control completely, and raged for at least 12 hours.
 
 A senior fire official claimed they contained the fire “to a great extent” by 10pm. In a first for the city, 5,000 armymen were called in to handle the operation, and deployed to ensure the fire did not enter the defence area near the lake.
 
 Fire officials said they received the complaint close to noon, and dispatched a truck to the site. However, the vehicle could not reach the spot; so bunches of wet plants were used to beat back the fire. They said dry grass on the lake surface may have led to the fire, but were yet to ascertain the cause.   executive engineer   said it the blaze was uncontrollable even at 8pm. “The fire has still not been controlled on the Sun City side. The grass appears to have caught fire; or, someone, perhaps, lit it,” he told TOI. The BDA is the custodian of the lake.
 
 “The fire started around 10am on the Yamalur side of the lake. We had warned Bangalore Development Authority to take measures to contain pollution in the waterbody to ensure something like this does not happen. Clearly, nothing was done. Fire tenders present at the spot couldn’t enter the lake,” said  , a resident.
