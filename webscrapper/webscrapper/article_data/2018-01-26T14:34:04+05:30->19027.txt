Patriotism is a way of life and comes naturally to all Indians and over the years, showcasing it has gained prominence — especially on days of national importance like the Republic Day. Celebrating the day and cherishing it in every way one can, is quite common. 

 
 
 
 
 This year, go to town sporting Indian traditional wear, and let the world know what patriotism means to you in stylish way. Here are a few ideas...
 
 
 
 
 In the morning of the Republic Day, keep things simple and elegant. Pair colours cleverly to highlight the muted subtle look.  , pure cottons, linens and raw silks in beige, nude, camel, tan, ivory, off-whites look great. Layer your outfits with Nehru jackets in formal fabrics and add tan lace-ups to complete the look.

 For a festive, yet suave evening look, opt for deep dues and dark shades. Nehru jackets with embellished buttons, Nehru-collared kurtas, embroidered dupattas, fitted jackets with prints and embellishments, will look great. You can add a pop of colour with the help of a pocket square in a rich contrasting colour — with a blue jacket wear a bright red pocket square. You can wear mojris or black leather Oxfords to round off the look. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 There are stylish tote bags in tricolour available online or even at your local store. If you don’t want to go all out by wearing saffron, white and green combo, you can at least choose accessories like tricolour bags and caps.
 
 
 - Make the national flag colours the stars at home by using them in innovative ways to do up your home. Tricolour cushion covers, table runners will show off your patriotic spirit. Place three coffee mugs in these three colours in a row and viola, you have a pretty centrepiece.
 
 
 - Let your workstation showcase some patriotism. Cheer up the place by buying some unique flag stands.
