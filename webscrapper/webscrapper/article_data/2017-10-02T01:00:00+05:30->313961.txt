It has to be noted that   spoke about self-respect at a political event some time ago, which according to many, was a jibe against  , who was also present at the function. Seems like on Sunday, at   Ganesan’s   launch, Rajini had an upper hand over his counterpart. 

 Kamal spoke about the greatness of Sivaji as a person and as an actor, and stressed the need to honour the artiste irrespective of the party in power. Rajini, on the other hand, spoke about former CM Jayalalithaa, Deputy CM O Panneer Selvam and others who helped in coming up with such an event. After expressing his regards for Sivaji and his influence among others, Rajini steered his speech to politics. 
 
 He said, “This is an event which has a mix of politics and cinema. Sivaji sir couldn’t succeed in his constituency, which was not actually his bad luck, the people’s. For an actor to win in politics, the fame and influence aren’t enough. One needs more than that which people are aware about. To be honest, I don’t know about it. I think Kamal knows it. Even if he knows, he won’t share it with me. May be if I had asked him about it a couple of months ago, he would have told to me. Now, he will insist me to join him if I ask him about it.”
