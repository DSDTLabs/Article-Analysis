HYDERABAD: Around 5,000 Information Technology employees and their families took part in two (10k and 5k) runs from   for saving the girl child on Sunday. The runs were organised by Seva Bharathi.

 More than 1,000 girls, who are enrolled in   centres, also took part in the run. The ‘Run for Girl Child’ was flagged off by Vinod Agrawal, and several other well-known personalities.
 
 “It was lot of fun to run the entire distance. I had no plans to participate, but once I heard its for a good cause, I decided to get up early and take part,” said Mohsin Abbbas, a techie. 
 
 Many volunteers, who championed the cause of girl child education, planned and executed the event with companies like Capgemini, Genpact and several other IT companies supporting the cause. Seva Bharathi’s Kishori Vikas programme has been planned to educate and empower adolescent girls in slums, bastis and villages. Seva Bharathi is presently running more than 100 Kishori Vikas centres benefitting more than 2,500 girls. Each   provides education, vocational, health and other developmental activities to 25 girls in a slum from Monday to Saturday.
