LUCKNOW: Jailed gangster-turned-politician   suffered a heart attack on Tuesday morning. Ansari, who is lodged in   jail, was rushed to the district hospital when he collapsed. Afsa, wife of the 58-year-old BSP MLA from  , was visiting him in   at the time along with her kids. She too complained of chest pain. Both were put in an ambulance and taken to hospital.

 As Ansari was continuously perspiring and not responding, doctors referred him to Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences ( SGPGI) in Lucknow for better medical care. Though his condition started improving after some time, the doctors did not take any chance. He was ferried to SGPGI along with his wife. Ansari reached SGPGI around 7 pm and was rushed to MICU and put under observation. Ansari, who is facing 18 court cases at present, is a diabetic, revealed sources.
 
 Brijesh Jaiswal, an aide of Ansari, said that the BSP MLA must have informed jail staff about his health. “We will find out if the staff gave him proper care after that or not,” he said. Principal secretary of home department Arvind Kumar said that an inquiry had been ordered and a report had been sought from prison officials.
