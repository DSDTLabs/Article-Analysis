BHOPAL: A security guard of veterinary hospital was in for a shock when a Rs 500 note dispensed from a   in Hoshangabad district had “Children Bank of India” printed on it.

 The guard,  , subsequently approached the bank officials to get his note replaced, but was not heard, said sources. Kewat said he had gone to withdraw Rs 2000 from the ATM, but one of the currency notes was fake. He said he initially kept the notes in his wallet and stepped out of the ATM. Later, when he checked them outside, three Rs 500 notes were okay, but the fourth one was different, he said. The note had the same colour as original currency and the printed figures in the same font as the original, but had a seal of “Children Bank of India” instead of RBI. It also had “Full of Fun” written in place of the watermarks.
 
 On the other hand,   officials maintain that all their currency chests have a very secure system to monitor veracity of notes. “All notes received and to be dispensed by the bank, either through its ATMs or its branches, are processed through the latest state-of-the-art note-sorting machines,” said an officer. These machines are equipped with the templates of all legal tender in the country and any note not conforming to the security features is separated as “suspect note” for further manual scrutiny. No fake note is likely to be dispensed through the bank ATMs at any time, they said.
 
 Bank manager   told media that he would look into the complaint. “The cash is replenished by the same cash replenishment agency. We will discuss it with them, besides examining the   footage,” said the officer. Police say if they get an official complaint on the matter they would register an FIR under sections 489B (using forged currency notes), 489E (making use of documents looking like currency notes) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC.
