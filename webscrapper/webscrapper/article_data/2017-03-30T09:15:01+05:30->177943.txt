ROPAR: The ‘goonda tax’ centres that mushroomed in Ropar district over the last 10 years have disappeared withing 10 days of the authorities coming down heavily against illegal mining. The district administration recently constituted 23 teams comprising officials of police and mining departments, which registered nine FIRs against illegal mining and possessing and ferrying of sand and gravel mined illegally.

 “While no action has been taken against miners who are working at sites which were legally auctioned, teams swooped down in areas that had not been earmarked and registered cases against those found mining sand and gravel illegally,” Ropar senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nilambari Vijay Jagdev told TOI on Wednesday.
 
 “We have impounded a number of vehicles. However, the idea is not just to book drivers but break the entire nexus which has been active in the area over the last many years,” the SSP said. Maintaining that since the investigations were at an  , he said it would be inappropriate to say if the miners were   or if they were operating as a mafia. “One thing is for sure that illegal mining was rampant in the area,” she said.
 
 Local RTI activist Dinesh Chadha, who had got action initiated against the   by writing to the   (ECI), said, “I had filed a similar complaint during the 2012 assembly elections after which these centres had disappeared from the district but return after sometime.” An attempt to murder case was also slapped against Chadha, following which he had launched an agitation along with other lawyers from the Ropar  . Soon after, charges were dropped against him.
