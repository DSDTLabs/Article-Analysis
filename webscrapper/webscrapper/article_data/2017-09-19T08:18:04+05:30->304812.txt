KOLKATA:   Sheikh Hasina’s political adviser H T Imam, in Kolkata for a meeting, lost his   while travelling to Kolkata from Dhaka on Sunday. Head of Bangladesh chancery in Kolkata B M Jamal Hossain has lodged a complaint with the Beniapukur police station in this regard.

 Imam’s phone, Bangladeshi officials said, might contain some important documents since he is an official of cabinet minister rank and is close to  . It is still unclear how he came to lose his   since he had been surrounded by senior Bangladeshi diplomats ever since he reached the city airport. The scenario was the same when he later went to a city hotel. The police complaint mentioned that the phone was lost somewhere near the Bangladesh deputy high commission close to Park Circus. The cops are trying to find out if Imam had simply misplaced it. 
 
 However, the sleuths are worried since the phone has not been turned in by anyone as yet. Cops are also trying to find out if the SIM card has been removed or not. Moreover, the possibility of data theft from the lost phone is also being probed. 
 
 A Kolkata Police officer said that tracking the lost phone was their top priority as they felt that delay will harm the reputation of the force. However, the delay in tracking the phone has surprised officials as they said that Apple has a mechanism to track lost phones, which has failed in this case.
 
 On Monday, Bangladeshi deputy high commissioner Toufique Hasan said that the mobile was yet to be traced, but he hoped it would be spotted soon.
