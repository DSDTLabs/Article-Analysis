HUBBALI: The   ( ) has decided to hold   in the twin cities from January 25 to February 4. 

 The public can raise issues pertaining to water supply to the notice of board officials for on-the-spot resolution. The board is extending adalats to  -Dharwad after receiving a good response in Bengaluru.
 
 Ashok Madyal, executive engineer, KUWSDB, said that Water Adalat is a good process to understand the problems faced by public and issues related to water bills. “This move will encourage the payment of balance water bills,” he said. Madyal stated that the board will supply water 24x7 in the entire twin cities by the end of 2017. This is reason why the board has to collect balance of water bill from the public at the earliest. 
 
 “We can’t register our complaint at the KUWSDB office because it’s far from our area. It’s a welcome move that the board is coming to our areas through Water Adalats,” said Ramesh Kundanagar, a resident of Navangar. Prakash Hosamani, a resident of Lingaraj Nagar, said that the water board has been supplying water once a week in his area. “But the frequency was increased to once a fortnight since a month. I hope the adalat will resolve this issue,” he said. “The KUWSDB has taken a good decision of addressing public grievances through Water Adalats. These adalats should be helpful in resolving problems. They should not be just a formal procedure,” said Siddappa Nagenhalli of Bengeri.
