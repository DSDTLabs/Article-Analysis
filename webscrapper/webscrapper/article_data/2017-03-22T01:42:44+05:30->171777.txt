 Armed with garbage bags and glass-picking aids, forest guards and labourers spent cose to two hours rummaging through the bushes and leaves and scraped off the waste lodged in the drying watering holes in the forest pocket adjacent to the   village.
 
 Sujay Koli, round forest officer at the Yeoor Forest Range, said, “We narrowed down the cleanliness drive to survey number 14 area as it is the closest to the village and most likely to have a lot of dumped waste. While the tribal community that resides in this area uses the age-old methods to dispose off waste, they just dump non-biodegradable waste in the forest.” 
 
 He added that the collected waste was handed over to the civic garbage vans for disposal. -- Freny Fernandes
