SURAT: Two persons were recently cheated of Rs 90,000 by fraudsters in the city who first took the victims’ ATM card numbers and then passwords and got the money transferred to their respective bank accounts. 

 Lakshman K Sayla, 32, a tailor, was cheated of Rs 50,799 by a cheat who introduced himself as Rahul Sharma from Andhra Bank. Sayla, who lives in Ektanagar of Parvat village, was told by Sharma that his ATM card has been deactivated by the bank. Sharma claimed that he was an officer posted in the main branch of the bank and can make it operational again but needed the 16 digit card number and the three digit CVV number. Sayla was convinced that he was from the bank and gave him the details which the fraudster used to withdraw Rs 50,900 from the former’s account. 
 
 Sayla lodged a police complaint on February 15 under IPC sections 406, 419 and 420 and   section 66 (C) and (D).
