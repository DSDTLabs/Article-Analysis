LUCKNOW: When BSP chief   announced its list of candidates comprising 36 from the Thakur community—three more than she fielded in 2012—on Tuesday, it was no less than a surprise for many. Reason: Mayawati's massive faceoff with BJP vis-a-vis   Singh episode.

 On July 20, 2016, Singh, a former UP BJP vice-president and Thakur by caste had reportedly compared the BSP chief with a sex worker, visavis the allegation that she charges hefty amounts for party ticket. The remark sparked off a massive agitation by BSP cadres who hit the streets in Lucknow and raised objectionable slogans on Singh, his sister and daughter. Later, police lodged a case under POSCO act against BSP leaders, including Naseemuddin Siddiqui.
 
 The incident led to a raging controversy with   accusing BJP of using deliberately one of its Thakur leaders to level a disparaging remark on her. The incident, nevertheless, caused big embarrassment for the BSP boss who had been trying to align with the upper caste as part of her social engineering formula.
 
 Mayawati had, in fact, formed a separate unit of her Thakur cadre to work in the reserved constituencies and bring in people of the Kshatriya community at par with Dalits. “The incident was an outrageous attempt to malign our leader. The remark on her was not in keeping with what   are known for,” said a BSP leader from the community. “Thakurs are traditionally known as protectors,” he added.
