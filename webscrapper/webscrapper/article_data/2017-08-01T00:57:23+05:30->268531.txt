MUMBAI: The BEST undertaking will take 1,250 buses—800 regular buses and 450 minibuses—on  , thus saving over Rs 100 crore annually.

 The announcement came at a meeting convened by   at BMC headquarters on Monday, where   and   were present along with committee members.
 
 Mehta told TOI that the BMC was willing to spend for capital expenditure for purchasing new buses in future. “However, in case of wet-leasing, no capital investment is required,” he added. “The monthly rent can be paid to the private bus contractor by cutting down establishment costs, improving fuel efficiency and from ticket earnings.”
 
 “In fact, the rent per kilometre for taking buses on lease is cheaper than the actual costs involved in running a bus presently in the fleet,” Mehta pointed out, adding that by taking buses on lease, you can expect ‘private sector efficiency’ as well as control ticket pricing.
 
 At the meeting, it was also disclosed that there would be a ‘freeze’ on recruitment in the BEST and rationalization of bus routes. Mehta said loss-making BEST routes—that earn less than 40 paise for every rupee spent—will soon have just a few trips daily, mainly during peak hours. 
 
 “We plan to introduce contactless cards in future, in-bus entertainment and GPS and GIS to improve our services,” said BEST panel chairman Anil Kokil. Sources said the BEST plans to reduce fares for short-distance feeder routes and increase it marginally for long-distance routes. 
 
 Meanwhile, BEST workers’ union will go on an indefinite hunger strike outside Wadala bus depot from Tuesday morning; they will be joined by a section of BEST staffers. Bus and electricity services will not be affected.
