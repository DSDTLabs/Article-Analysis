Surat: Demonetization surely has hit adversely the kite and manja business ahead of Uttarayan in the city, but manja makers and kite sellers have not lost hope as yet and expect sale prospects to improve during the last moment. 

 Kartik Patel, a resident of Adajan, for the last 27 years has been buying kites and manja for Uttarayan between January 7 and 10 only. He and his family members then used to tie ‘kannas’ on the kites and enjoy Uttarayan together.
 
 However, he has lost much of interest in the kites this year mainly because of demonetization. He said, “We will fly kites, but only on the day of Uttarayan. I would take my kids to the market on the night of January 13 and get them a few kites and manja. Also, I feel kites do hurt a lot of birds and hence have decided to put a check on my passion for kite flying.”
 
  is a kite seller and manja maker. His   is famous in the city. “The business in the market is just 50 per cent to what it used to be. There are four days left for the festival and the ambience of excitement is missing. We hope the business and mood to change for good in the next three-four days.” 
 
 Rupal Desai, a young woman, has always been passionate about kites, but no more. She said, “I will not fly kites because they end up hurting birds and even people. I will do charity with the money that I have.” 
 
 Trupti Patel, a resident of City Light, said, “Uttarayan celebrations in the city could lack verve and mirth of past years for varied reasons. However, all the terraces will still host the never-ending feasts of ‘undhiu, jalebi and mattha’ with loud music playing in the background, for sure!”
