Howrah: A debate over Ram and Hanuman between some students of Uluberia High School since last week spilled on to the streets on Tuesday and locals, allegedly armed with rods, attacked the schoolboys. They didn’t even spare the teachers and guardians who tried to rescue the students. A battalion of the Rapid Action Force (RAF) deployed at the spot resorted to lathicharge to disperse the mob. Guardians, who were also allegedly attacked, signed a mass petition demanding police protection in and around the school. Barring a teacher, who was reportedly attacked, no one spoke to media. Last Wednesday, the debate between the boys of classes IX and X turned ugly with some students allegedly resorting to fisticuffs. Another fight broke out between the same students ahead of a unit test on Tuesday. The boys at the receiving end allegedly sent out messages alerting friends and locals outside. Soon after the test was over, students, guardians and teachers found that a large group of locals, not associated with the school, had gathered outside. Some students allegedly went out and identified the students, who had allegedly beaten them up, to the locals. The mob then “attacked” the accused students with rods. The guardians and teachers, who tried to save them, too came under attack. Injured geography teacher Kartik Das said: “I am stunned with the attack.”
