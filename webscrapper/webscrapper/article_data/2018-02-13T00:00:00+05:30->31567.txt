In June last year, there was a quest to put to test some of the brightest young minds in the city and see what they thought were the best ideas to ‘Save Electricity’. A whopping 110 teams from schools across the city participated and over months of filtering projects based on their efficacy in real-world scenarios, 20 were shortlisted for the finale of the   on Saturday. From smart power houses, smart cities, generating electricity at home and in the playground — much was on display, with each team explaining its concept with miniature working model demonstrations, in their bid to win the ‘Most Powerful Team’ title.
Judges for the day, MG   and   from the   had their task cut out, grilling each team on project specifics. In fact, RK Kumar was confident that some of the ideas could be used in real life. “Most of the top 20 projects most were about solar power heaters or generating electricity with solar power, which are already being applied in quite a few areas across the country. But there were a couple of ideas that we thought were novel and deserve a closer look for implementation,” says Kumar.
 In the end, an innovative project by the team from  , including   (Class 7), Aarush Mehrotra (Class 8) and Soham Lohakarey (Class 7), was adjudged the best. Their model, about generating electricity from the playground, from play things like the seesaw, merry-go-round, etc., caught the attention of the judges, given the scope of taking the idea to parks across the city. “We really didn’t expect to win, as our model was not ready till the previous morning and once we got it up and running, it was damaged on the car ride to the venue of the finale. But we somehow managed to make it work,” says, Mihir.
