AGRA: The  , on Tuesday, directed temples in Mathura and Vrindavan to donate flowers that are offered to deities to the government-run shelter homes for widows and destitute women here. The apex court's order is set to improve livelihoods of the 450 women in these shelter homes, who can use flowers to make perfumes or incense sticks. 

 The order complements Uttar Pradesh government's efforts to uplift the lives of these women. The state government had recently began training widows in fragrance and flavour development at centres of the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises. The apex court had in 2017 set up a six-member panel to work on "pragmatic and workable" suggestions which can lead to improving the lives of widows and help them lead a life of dignity. 
 
 Talking to TOI, district probation officer of Mathura, Anurag  , said, "There are five government-run shelter homes in Vrindavan, located at Sita Ram Sadan, Phase I, Phase II, Ras Bihari and Neel Kunj. We have already trained 90 widows in making perfumes, incense sticks, gulal, hawan material, etc. The training of 30 others is under way." 
 
 "One centre will be established at   in Vrindavan where those trained will be employed," added Rastogi.
 
 Shakti Vinay Shukla, director of training wing at the Fragrance and   in Kannauj, said, "We plan to start production of items from July this year. The quality of flowers in Vrindavan temples is suitable for preparation of perfumes and other products. We have also taken samples from temples in Varanasi and talks are on to run a similar project there."
 
 According to official sources, nearly 250-300 kg of flowers is offered at various Mathura and Vrindavan temples every day. During festive seasons, the amount goes up to 1,000 kg.
 
 The top court in July last year, had also asked the Centre to frame schemes to promote remarriage of widows.
