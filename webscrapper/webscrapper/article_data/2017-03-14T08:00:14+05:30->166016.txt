CHINSURAH: The driver of the MUV which crashed into a   last Tuesday, killing folk singer Kalikaprasad Bhattacharya, was arrested from Kasba on Sunday night. 

  Arnab Rao was arrested 24 hours after the singer's wife Ritocheta lodged an FIR against him at Gurap police station. Arnab and four musicians of Kalikaprasad's band, Dohar, survived with injuries. Rao has been charged under Section 304 IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). He was produced in Chinsurah court and remanded in a two-day police custody. 
 
 Cops and forensic experts team rejected Rao's claim that he lost control while swerving to the left fearing the rear of a trailer would hit the car. After inspecting the accident vehicle and the spot, forensic experts concluded the driver was actually unmindful. "After investigating, we found that Rao didn't apply the brakes and the vehicle hit a road sign," said Gurap OC Bankim Biswas.
