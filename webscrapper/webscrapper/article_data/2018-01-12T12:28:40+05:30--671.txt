Bigg Boss 11 has been a roller coaster ride not just for the housemates but also for the viewers. While we saw finalist Shilpa Shinde and Vikas Gupta's family members extending support to their children, Hina Khan's fans were waiting to see her parents come out and root for their doting daughter. Now that the finale is just around the corner, Hina's father has broken his silence. In a conversation with us, he poured his heart out while talking about his darling girl. "Hina has been the best child any parent can have and we are extremely lucky. We come from a middle class background and have had a similar lifestyle. Hina and her brother Aamir wanted to pursue their education and hence, the two shifted to Delhi." Not many know that TV's Akshara struggled and worked in a call centre to meet her and Aamir's expenses while they were studying for MBA. "Hina, after her college hours, used to work in a call centre so that I wouldn't be monetarily pressurized for their expenses. She would take care of her and her brother's expenses while studying." "Hina never argued or questioned us for not being able to meet their expectations as we were not financially sound. In fact, she always made it a point to keep us happy in every possible way. My daughter is undoubtedly the best because no one can take care of their parents and look after their family the way she does. She makes sure that all our needs are fulfilled and loves us abundantly. I could not have asked for anything more in life better than my little girl."
