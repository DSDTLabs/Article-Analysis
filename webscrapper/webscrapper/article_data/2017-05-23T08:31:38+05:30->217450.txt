VADODARA: The   (VMC) is set to conduct one of the biggest razing drives in the city in the recent past. The   is set to demolish 1,841 dwellings in   in Warasiya.

 The VMC has already informed residents of Sanjaynagar regarding the impending razing of the settlement.
 
  It has also started a survey in the slums to identify beneficiaries who will have to be awarded houses when a housing scheme comes up on the land where the settlement is located.
 
 The largest razing drive conducted by the VMC so far was that in Kalyannagar in Fatehgunj. The civic body had razed around 1,900 houses in November 2014 even as the resettlement of those who were staying there has remained a bone of contention so far.
 
 The civic body will be coming up with the biggest housing scheme for the economic weaker sections of the society at Sanjaynagar. As many as, 2,637 houses will be constructed at the site as a part of the project.
 
 The housing scheme will come up under the Pradhan Mantri Aavas Yojana (PMAY) on a public-private partnership mode. Houses of 30 sq m size are provided to slum dwellers or those staying in unauthorised settlements will be provided at the site. 
 
 After giving houses to 1,841 families, the remaining houses will be used by the civic body for the resettlement of residents of other such pockets in the city.
 
 Sanjaynagar residents, meanwhile, approached the VMC demanding a higher rent. Under the policy, the developer is supposed to pay Rs 2,000 as rent to each of the family. But residents stated that this was insufficient and they would not get houses for this amount on rent.
