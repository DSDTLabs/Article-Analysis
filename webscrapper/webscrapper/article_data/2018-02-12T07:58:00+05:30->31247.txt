Chandhigarh: The Haryana government has directed all civil surgeons, principal medical officers and medical superintendents to make sure treatment is not delayed or denied to any patient who does not have Aadhaar card or any other identity card.

 Director general, health services Dr Satish Kumar Aggarwal said they must first provide immediate treatment to patients coming to hospital in serious condition and tackle file work meant for records later. He warned of disciplinary action against those who donâ€™t comply with orders. Aadhaar card is not compulsory for patients in need of treatment in state hospitals, he said.
 
 The decision came after two incidents of patients being refused medical assistance in the absence of Aadhaar card were reported. The first case was that of a pregnant woman refused admittance in the labour ward of a Gurugram hospital for not having an Aadhaar card. She delivered a baby outside the emergency ward.
 
 This was followed by another pregnant woman refused medical assistance in the absence of an Aadhaar card in Ambala civil hospital. She also delivered her baby on the hospital premises. 
 
 After these cases, state health minister Anil Vij assured that treatment would not be denied to any patient in the absence of Aadhaar card.
