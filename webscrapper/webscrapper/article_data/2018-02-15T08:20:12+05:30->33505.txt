SECUNDERABAD : Commuters may get some relief soon, with steps being taken to ease a major bottleneck at   in Secunderabad Cantonment.

 On Wednesday, the president of Cantonment Board (PCB), Brigadier M D Upadhyay; Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) chief executive officer SVR Chandra Sekhar; and ward number 1 (Bowenpally) member  , inspected vacant defence land located off the main road for possible use in road widening.
 
 Hundreds of commuters from Balanagar, proceeding towards  ,  ,   and other parts of the Cantonment, often face congested roads. Widening the road in this area has been a major hurdle for Secunderabad Cantonment because of a Muslim graveyard located on the right side and defence land on the left. In fact, Trimulgherry traffic police and local elected members have made several representations to the SCB CEO to allot defence land for road widening.
  
  
 “For road widening, at least one-acre defence land will be required,” SCB ward member-1, J Maheshwara Reddy told TOI. “The PCB has responded to my plea and given an assurance that the allotment of one acre defence land for road widening will be discussed with the Local Military Authority soon and that he will see that the land is allotted quickly,” Reddy said.
 
 The PCB also inspected defence land at various places in the Secunderabad Cantonment to explore suitable alternative land for garbage transit points.
