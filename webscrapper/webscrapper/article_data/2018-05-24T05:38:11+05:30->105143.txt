MUZAFFARNAGAR
  Manoj Kumar (name changed), a resident of Muzaffarnagar, was in for a surprise when he received a call from   Anant Deo   on Wednesday. He was apprehensive at first (it wasn't everyday that the SSP called him up) but soon realized that all Tiwari wanted to know was if he faced any problems in his locality. He informed the cop about a group of gamblers in his area and the problem was sorted in a few days.
 
  SSP Tiwari has been calling up local residents, asking them if they faced any law-and-order related problem in their areas. The SSP's initiative aims to interact directly with the masses and build trust among them. Talking to TOI, Tiwari said, “People often want to approach us but are unable to, owing to various reasons. On our part, we should reach out to them as they could provide us with some useful advice or tell us about their issues, which we could sort out after a small chat with them over the phone.”
  
  Members of community policing, which was started by the SSP a year ago, also receive regular calls from him. The SSP said people felt good on receiving calls from him. “They tell me whatever I ask about,” he said.
  
   , another resident of Muzaffarnagar, believed that the incidences of crime in the district had considerably gone down since Tiwari took over as the SSP a year ago. According to police sources, 164 encounters had been conducted against hardened criminals. The sources added that 65 culprits had sustained bullet injuries and were arrested, eight had been gunned down and 328 history-sheeters were arrested in the last one year.
