BENGALURU: The cash-for-high-command scandal seems to have turned into a nightmare for investigating agencies in Karnataka. Both the   and the   have been approaching one agency or the other to lodge complaints against one another. 

 The Congress has filed complaints with the Lokayukta and the   ( ). To counter this, the BJP has taken the matter to the Lokayukta and the Bengaluru police commissioner's office.
 
 On Saturday, the political battle took another twist with the BJP legislators, including V Somanna, Ravi Subrahmanya, C N Ashwath Narayan and B N Vijaykumar claiming that they have filed a case of forgery against Congress ministers K R Ramesh Kumar, Basavaraj Rayaraddi and M B Patil. The trio had released the CD of the BJP leaders allegedly discussing about sending money to the leadership. 
 
 The BJP said it has filed a complaint against the ministers under sections 192, 193 and 196 of the IPC, amounting to falsification of evidence and doctoring the CD. 
 
 However, sources in the commissioner's office said the BJP has only submitted a memorandum and no case has been registered yet.
 
 Last week, the   and BJP MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar filed complaints with the Lokayukta against the BJP and the Congress respectively, over misuse of public office to fund their respective high commands in New Delhi. Chandrasekhar has approached the quasi-judicial body seeking a probe into the allegation of BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa that the Congress government had taken kickbacks for awarding the steel bridge flyover contract. The KPCC legal cell had alleged that Yeddyurappa and H N Ananth Kumar had admitted in the CD to have funded the leadership during the BJP tenure in the state between 2008 and 2013.
 
 Lokayukta additional registrar M Ramesh Rao said: "The complaint is with us. We can't share anything else."
 
 On the KPCC's complaint, ACB inspector general H C Kishore Chandra said: "The matter has come to us; we are inquiring into it."
