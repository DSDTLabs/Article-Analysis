INDORE/BHOPAL: The terror strike on an   bus has put the relatives of hundreds of pilgrims from Indore and   on edge back home. Many are cutting their trip short and returning home but others are determined to press on. 

 Many families in both cities spent a nervous night because they couldn't contact the pilgrims. "When we got news of the attack on Monday night we started calling all 35 of our pilgrims. Thankfully, everyone is safe, as their bus was much ahead in the convoy," Rajesh Jain, coordinator of   pilgrimage said.
 
 Other groups of pilgrims have told their families back home that they are facing problems because tension is high even in Jammu. Hotels are charging twice and trice the regular tariff, they say. "The major Jammu market was closed on Tuesday. Till evening, cellphone networks were down. We are cutting short our trip," said Rahul Raikwar, a pilgrim stranded in Jammu.
 
 More than 800 people from Bhopal are on the Amarnath Yatra. "When news of the attack flashed on TV screens, even neighbours rushed to us as my father and brother are on their way to Amarnath," said Sanjay Soni, a resident of Ashoka Garden in Bhopal.
 
 "My father  , is on his 16th Amarnath Yatra. He was there when pilgrims were fired upon earlier in Pahalgam. Some 40 of our family and friends are on the Yatra this time," Soni said.
