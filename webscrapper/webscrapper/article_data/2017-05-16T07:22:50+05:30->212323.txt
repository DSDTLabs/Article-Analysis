BENGALURU: The All India Online Vendor's Association ( ) has written a letter to the ministry of corporate affairs ( ), raising concerns over the proposed sale of the beleaguered e-tailer  . 

 The letter, which has been reviewed by TOI, has asked for the ministry's help in resolving seller disputes before clearing the sale to bigger rival  . AIOVA, which has about 2,000 sellers as members, addressed the letter to MCA secretary  .
 
 "We would like to inform you via this email that more than 500 sellers have complained to us regarding unsettled financial matters with the current management of Snapdeal. We had compiled and submitted a small list to the management of Snapdeal informally in March, however, they never acted on the same," the letter sent to Ray noted. 
 
 According to the seller association, losing money on their dues from Snapdeal would be detrimental to their business as the members are already facing significant losses from   winding up operations.
 
 A spokesperson of AIOVA said, "  has also declined to intervene in any matter. This leaves us with the option of approaching MCA to safeguard sellers' rights before any change can take place in corporate structure." According to experts, legally, a seller or their community cannot stop the merger process unless either of them drags the company to court on a valid ground.
 
 A spokesperson of Snapdeal said, "Payments to sellers are made as per pre-defined payment cycles and these continue to be made. It should be clear that payments are made only as per contractual commitments and in accordance with seller policies. Robust grievance redressal mechanisms exist to address any escalations from individual sellers."
