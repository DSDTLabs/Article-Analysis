LUDHIANA: Raising fingers over the SAD-BJP ruling combine, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener   and party's candidate from Dakha constituency HS Phoolka on Thursday claimed that the Badal government had deliberately suppressed the findings of a commission on the Bargari desecration and subsequent firing on Sikh protesters. 

 Flanked by Phoolka and AAP's candidate from Ludhiana (West) Ahbaab Singh Grewal, Kejriwal displayed a copy of the Justice   Commission's report, which he claimed was given to them by some person on Wednesday evening.
 
 "We all suspected that big names were involved in the desecration of   to scuttle peace in the state as those people knew that they were not coming back to power. The report confirms that the investigation was not done in the desecration incident properly. The Badal government also tried to deliberately whitewash the findings of the commission. Why this report was suppressed for months? Because they didn't want facts to be exposed," the Delhi chief minister said.
 
 Kejriwal said while the government claimed that the police fired in self defence, commission's finding suggested otherwise and in contradiction to what the government said. He said bullets were fired on defenceless protesters and that too from one yard. "We need to appreciate the people of Punjab, who despite attempts to incite them maintained peace" said Kejriwal.
