INDORE: At 3am on Wednesday, when Mumbai's players were in deep sleep after having sweated it out on a tough opening day in their   against Gujarat, a key member of the team had to be rushed to hospital. It was a medical emergency. The change of weather from the comparatively warmer Mumbai to much-cooler Indore had done   in.

 The 33-year-old was struck with a chest infection and had developed high fever. It looked bad, but it was futile to convince the fired up, in-form cricketer to miss the rest of the final. All the doctor could do was give him two injections, followed by a third one on Thursday morning, and a heavy dose of antibiotics.
 
 A combination of that treatment, and the player's tremendous willpower, has since then seen Nayar grant fresh life to Mumbai's hopes in the final. After bowling 30 overs for his three wickets on Thursday, Nayar cracked a potentially match-winning 91 (146b, 5x4, 5x6) to give the defending champions a reasonable chance of beating Gujarat, despite Mumbai playing catch-up for most part of this thrilling Ranji Trophy final. 
 
 Riding on half-centuries by Nayar and skipper   (69; 114b, 12x4), Mumbai finished their second innings in an extended final session at 411. That left Gujarat with a 312-run target to chase in their second dig in 103.4 overs. They now have the choice of either going for the chase or batting out the final day. Even if they manage to bat through, they will win their first-ever Ranji title by virtue of the first-innings lead. 
 
 At stumps, Gujarat were well-placed at 47 without loss. After Chintan Gaja finished with a six-wicket haul, Gujarat were bolstered by a blazing start by the season's highest run scorer, Priyank Panchal, who cracked seven fours in his unbeaten 34 off 45 balls. Panchal is now 111 short of  's record tally of 1415 - the maximum by any batsman in one Ranji edition.
