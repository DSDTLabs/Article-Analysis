LUCKNOW: After a wait of 32 years, a meritorious   student who is now vice chancellor of Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University, Prof Manoj Dixit, received his two pending gold medals on Sunday. 

  The 56-year old who topped his masters in public administration in 1986 won the   and   gold medals for academics. He couldn't receive them then as the university did not hold a convocation that year. After being awarded, the VC took to social media posting old and present photographs. 
 
 "I won this medal at a young age and I am receiving it when I have lost all my hair. This shows how long the wait for the two medals was," said Dixit.
 
 Dixit has held various positions at Lucknow University too.
