PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Municipal commissioner   said action would be taken against   corporator   for dumping unauthorized flex boards and banners in PCMC’s building premises. 

 “If Kamthe is found guilty, appropriate action will be taken against him,”   said. 
 
 Kamthe is likely to be the first ruling BJP corporator against whom civic officials will lodge police complaints. Hardikar has given instructions to file police complaints against corporators and others who conduct agitations inside the main office. 
 
 Civic officials have lodged a police complaint against  , group leader of   corporators, for dumping garbage on the premises to protest against non-clearance of waste from his ward.
 
 Kamthe said he wrote to Hardikar thrice complaining about the flex boards and banners in his ward in the past five months and sought action. “They mar the city. These banners on the streetlight poles are a hindrance for vehicles. They also reduce the light falling from the streetlights on the road,” he said.
