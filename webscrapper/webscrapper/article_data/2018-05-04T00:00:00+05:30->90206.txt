The first time director   worked with late   was for their film Bangalore 23, during which the filmmaker was so impressed with the speech-and-hearing impaired actor that they decided to take their professional relationship further with another collaboration. The film   is about the struggles of people in the Bhadra forest region to safeguard its green cover and touches upon   activities as well. Tragedy struck when Dhruva passed away shortly after the team had wrapped up primary filming. “I was devastated. Kichchu is about Dhruva and he is not around to see how the film has turned out. The film was ready to be released months ago, but I could not bring myself to do it. But then someone said that I should release the film and honour the hardwork Dhruva had put into it,” says an emotional Pradeep. 
Produced by Ruby Sharma and Pradeep Raj, Kichchu hits theatres today and the director believes that it will show Dhruva in a different light. “He wanted the character to be speech-and-hearing impaired, and included the sounds that people with such challenges make. In fact, he dubbed that for himself.  , who has a similar impediment, is paired with him and seeing the two of them onscreen will be a delight,” he says.
