MANGALURU: Former KPCC president   on Saturday challenged chief minister Siddaramaiah to take a   at either   or Sri Kshetra Gokarnanateshwara that he (Siddaramaiah) had not opposed giving rice at Re 1 per kg, which he later made his flagship programme after assuming office.

 Poojary said Siddaramaiah a finance minister had opposed his proposal of distributing rice at Re 1 per kg. “As KPCC president, I suggested the Congress government implement a scheme to distribute rice at Re 1/kg, but it was opposed by Siddaramaiah who was the then finance minister. Let him take a truth test before the deity at Dharmastala or at Kudroli about this,” Poojary said, inviting the chief minister for an ‘Aaane Pramaana’. 
 
 Poojary said he is ready to accept a show-cause notice from the party high command and won’t mind if he’s removed from the party. “I’ll die happily as a Congressman even if the party expels me. There is no question of leaving Congress. Let them expel me today, but I’ll continue to be a Congressman. I’m not a politician, who jumps from one party to another for power,” Poojary said.
