The struggles of a newly-wed couple, especially that of the ghar jamai (a man who lives in his wife’s house) will be showcased in the new romcom series, 'Khatmal-E-Ishque — Biwi Ke Nakhre, Offo!'

 The show centres around Gauri Gupta ( ) who lives with her Nani ( ) and three maternal uncles (Shekhar Shukla, Atul Parchure and Prasad Barve), who are extremely possessive about her. When she turns of marriageable age, her uncles go on a hunt for a suitable match for her, but each of them rejects the other’s choice. Eventually, Nani introduces Shivam ( ) who agrees to become a ghar jamai. He, however, finds that he has more challenges to face than expected. For one, her uncles believe that they cannot allow a stranger to sleep in the same bed as their niece. Sadly, his bride seems to favour her family’s choices.
 Says Himanshu, “Sharing screen space with veteran actors like Atul Parchure has been a great experience. The story is different from the usual drama and the script is amazing. I am curious to see the audience reaction, hopefully they will like it as much as I have.”
 
 'Khatmal-E-Ishque' airs Monday to Friday at 10 pm on Sony SAB.
