PATNA: Jan Adhikar Party-Loktantrik (JAP-L) national patron and Madhepura MP   alias   on Monday attacked senior   functionary Sushil Kumar Modi for targeting “only RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s family” and asked as to why ‘benami’ and disproportionate properties of BJP functionaries who have made huge investments in real estate, should not be probed along with the alleged disproportionate properties of the members of Lalu-Rabri family.
 
  The JAP-L chief patron told reporters Sushil Modi should explain to the people as to how some functionaries of the saffron party opened showrooms of big companies in Bihar’s capital.
  
  “A BJP legislator from Kosi region has amassed disproportionate assets. He has made huge investment in real estate at several places. Why Sushil Modi is silent on the disproportionate properties of this particular BJP lawmaker?” asked Pappu Yadav, whose wife Ranjeeta Ranjan is   MP from Supaul parliamentary seat.
  
  Mentioning about his organisation’s regular demand for probe into the disproportionate assets of MLAs, MPs and ministers of all political parties, including those of JAP-L, Pappu urged CM   to order a vigilance probe into the assets of functionaries of all parties. He said since vigilance department operates under the state government, the CM can order a vigilance probe until the Centre orders a probe by the   or enforcement directorate.
  
  Drawing attention of central investigating agencies and political parties towards several high-rise malls being built up by criminal-turned-politicians in Patna and some other cities, Pappu questioned as to why CM Nitish Kumar was not ordering a vigilance probe into the properties of those MLAs and MPs who accumulated wealth through extortion and other criminal activities.
