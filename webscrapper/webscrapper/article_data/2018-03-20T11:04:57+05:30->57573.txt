CHANDIGARH: SAD general secretary Bikram Singh   on Monday sought registration of a criminal case against Punjab cabinet minister  , his wife Dr Navjot Kaur Sidhu and their accomplices for releasing the sealed cover report submitted by anti-drug special task force ( ) head to the Punjab and Haryana high court.

 Showing video of Sidhu’s last week press conference to the media persons, Majithia questioned the capacity in which the minister’s wife was holding the “Sidhu team’s false, fabricated and procured report” when she did not have any official position. He also questioned how Sidhu could access the sealed report.
 
 The Akali leader added that only registration of a case and a thorough investigation can unearth the larger conspiracy as well as the people behind it. “Sidhu and sons have come together to target and tarnish my reputation,” he said and added that leakage of the STF report was “gravest of criminal contempt” and an attempt to make a mockery of the judicial process.
 
 Targeting author of the report, anti-drug STF head   Sidhu, Majithia said they were directly related through his paternal aunt who was Harpreet’s maternal aunt. The SAD leader said the STF chief was trying to settle personal scores with him. “A conspiracy was hatched after five years to settle scores with the Majithia family,” he said. Majithia further added there is a section on ethics and propriety and that also applies to the STF head.
 
 Majithia added “all players in this drama” also needed to clarify as to what was the desperation or personal agenda to release a report which was being monitored by the high court on which state government had to submit reply.
