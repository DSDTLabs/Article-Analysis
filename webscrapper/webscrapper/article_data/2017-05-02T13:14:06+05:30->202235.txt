Recently there were reports of Salman Khan’s ‘Tubelight’ to be stalled in Pakistan during Eid, as the Pakistani government wanted more of their industry’s movies to be released in the country.

 Even Aamir Khan’s movies have done wonders in the Chinese entertainment industry and this time China is all set to welcome Salman Khan’s ‘Tubelight’.
