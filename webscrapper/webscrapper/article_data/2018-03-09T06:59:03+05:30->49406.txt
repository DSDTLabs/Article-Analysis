GANDHINAGAR: Prime minister   as the   in 2012 had formed an ambitious   (GWRA) with an aim to improving management of water resources in the state, but the state government, it seems, has put the idea in the cold storage. The idea behind the GWRA was to introduce judicious use of the state’s water resources through regulatory measures but despite the state facing acute water crisis, the state government has not done anything to revive the defunct body. After formation of the GWRA, the government never initiated steps to appoint any chairperson or members in the authority. The GWRA was formed to play a key role in regulating the limited resources and ensuring a fair use of both surface and ground water. One of the main functions as per the February 14, 2012 gazette notification of GWRA was to regulate water tariff system and charges for surface and sub-surface water used for domestic, agriculture, industrial and other purposes. It was also supposed to determine and regulate the distribution of water to various categories of users. It was also expected to periodically review and monitor the water sector costs and revenues.

 Parbat Patel, minister of state for irrigation and water supply, when contacted, said, “I am not aware of any such authority. I will have to check. However, there is certainly a need of such authority and the government will do the needful in this direction.”
