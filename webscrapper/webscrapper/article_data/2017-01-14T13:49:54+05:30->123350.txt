Actress   says she works to provide a good life to her family. 

  
  
 The actress said she at times takes up roles that pay well just to ensure that her 11-year-old daughter  , whom she has with her ex-partner  , gets everything. 
 
 "I go to work because it's what I do to support my family it's the only thing I really know how to do. But it's really hard to get passionate if it seems like it's something you can do blindfolded," Williams said. The 36-year-old actress said she puts her work/life balance on the top of her list of priorities. 
 
 "I have absolutely no pride about the size of the role. It's just about the quality. There's a life-work balance I'm always trying to achieve, I have a real desire to work from home, stay home, have consistency, and grounding," she said.
