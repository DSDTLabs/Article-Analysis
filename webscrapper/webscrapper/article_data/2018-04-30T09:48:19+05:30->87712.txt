CHARMINAR: Despite promises, patients at   continue to face a lot of inconvenience as the only lift in the emergency block, where the operation theatre is located, has been dysfunctional for almost two years now.

 Government Nizamia General Hospital, popularly known as Government Unani Hospital was established in the Nizams era.
 
 Charminar MLA   had promised to allocate money from his   fund on Unani Day, and assured the lift will be repaired at the earliest, but the problem has not been addressed yet.
 
 Patients brought in are put on a stretcher, and carried all the way to the first floor, where the operation theatre is located, via a ramp behind the building. The trauma care and emergency wards are also on the first floor.
 
 “It is a huge problem. Most patients who visit suffer from arthritis and paralysis. Pregnant women are forced to climb the stairs,” Dr A A Khan, state general secretary,   (TUMOA) said.
 
 Dr M A Vakeel, Resident Medical Officer of   said, “The MLA informed us that allocation of funds from MLA fund was not approved by the collector. He said that he will write to the state government about the problem and solve the issue at the earliest.”
