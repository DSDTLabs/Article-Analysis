JAIPUR: Health and ayurveda minister   said on Sunday that Hindi translations of Sanskrit shlokas and verses from Vedas, Puranas, Smritis, Ramayana and Mahabharata would be painted on the walls of state's 17,000 government hospitals in the coming months.

 These hospitals include district hospitals, community health centers and primary health centers of all medical disciplines allopathy, homeopathy and ayurveda. Saraf unveiled posters of 26 such verses on Sunday at Rajasthan   in Jaipur. The verses will be divided into three categories -inspirational, prayer and energizing. For each category , 150 verses will be shortlisted from the holy books.
 
 Different verses will be painted in different departments at hospitals. Presently , verses for three departments have been finalised.
 
  ya, Sarve Santu Niramaya (everybody should be happy and healthy) will be painted in OPDs;   (God, keep the person alive, healthy and happy) at operation theatres, while Acharaya Parmo Dharma (behaviour is supreme deed) would be written in labour rooms.
 
 Some other verses which have been selected are Maharishi Charak's `Jeerne Ashniyat' (another meal should be consumed only after the earlier one has been digested), ayurveda scholar Wag Bhatt's saying `Bhojnante Shatam Gachet' (100foot walk is necessary after the meal) and   (Bhramcharya is a key to healthy life) etc. The minister directed the Sanskrit Academy to form a committee to shortlist the remaining verses at the earliest.
 
 “A five-member committee, headed by Sanskrit Academy chairperson Jaya Dave, should finalise the remaining verses in a month,“ said Saraf.
 
 He cautioned the committee members to be careful while selecting the verses. He recalled the instance when governor Kalyan Singh had recited `funeral' verses during the inaugural session of Budget in 2016. Dave said the panel would also identify verses which could be inscribed on walls of departments like ENT, neurology etc.
