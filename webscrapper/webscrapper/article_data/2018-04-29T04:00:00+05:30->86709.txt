Rajkot: The contractor of a toll booth at Malvan village in Patadi taluka of Surendranagar district was killed when his car was crushed by a truck on Dhrangadhra-Viramgam highway early on Saturday. Though police have registered an accidental death in the case, the deceased’s family members allege murder. 

 Police identified the deceased as Naseebkhan Jatmalek alias Munna (35), a resident of Gedia village of Patadi taluka.
 
 According to Naseebkhan’s brother Ismailkhan Jatmalek’s (24) complaint, four trucks of Madhya Pradesh passing had reportedly crossed the toll booth without paying the toll tax. When the staff at the toll booth informed Naseebkhan over the phone, he decided to chase the trucks in his car. “When Naseebkhan did not return, the toll booth staff went in search of him and found his body in the car which was found in mangled condition on Dhrangadhra-Viramgam highway. It appears that Naseebkhan had picked up a fight with the drivers of the trucks and they allegedly rammed his car, killing him on the spot,” Dhrangadhra taluka police station sub-inspector V S Rathwa said. “Though we have primarily registered an accidental death case in this connection, the real cause of death will be ascertained once the postmortem is done,” Rathwa added.
