LUDHIANA: In response to the call given by the   ( ), Ludhiana transporters will go on an indefinite strike from April 8. Transporters are protesting against the increasing cost of running business due to hike in toll rates, diesel and insurance premium. 

 Apart from causing loss to the industry, which is largely dependant on supply of their products to other states, the strike is also expected to cause huge losses to transporters. Still, office-bearers of   ( ) maintained they would go on strike. 
 
 Charan Singh Lohara, former president, AIMTC and chairman, LGTA said, "The transport business is becoming more difficult by the day. Over the years, our margins have dipped."
 
 J P Aggarwal, general secretary, LGTA said, "Our strike is also against high rates of toll tax across the nation. Earlier also, we urged the government to end the system of toll tax because it leads to corruption, traffic jams and wastage of fuel. We are ready to pay a lumpsum charge, every year instead of paying toll tax at the barriers." 
 
 Meanwhile, industrialists are concerned about the effect of the strike on customers. Raw material being procured from other states will not be delivered and production will suffer if the strike continues for long.
