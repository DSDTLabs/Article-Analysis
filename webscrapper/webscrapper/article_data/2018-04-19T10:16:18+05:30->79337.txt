MADURAI: Seeking direction to the government to disburse grants to implement various  , a case has been filed before the Madras high court   bench.

 One P Dhanaraj of the Nellai Network of Voluntary Organisations for Social Welfare, a registered society, filed the case.
 
 According to him, 37 NGOs are enrolled members in the society. The central social welfare board implements various welfare programmes for women, children and handicapped people with the help of the state social welfare board through voluntary organisations. The boards give financial assistance to the organisations for extending services.
 
 Accordingly, Rajiv Gandhi National Creche Scheme is being implemented in the country for the children of working mothers from January 1, 2017. The central government sanctioned Rs 2.23 crore to the state government as its share for January to March in 2017.
 
 Out of the amount, the director-cum-mission director of integrated child development service had to disburse 90% of the amount to the members of the society. But, it granted only 30% to them. Ten per cent is the NGO’s contribution. The members run crèche in remote areas. They have spent Rs 2 lakh per year for a crèche. Due to non-disbursement of the remaining amount, the members are unable to run the crèche. Seeking the remaining amount, many representations were sent to the officials concerned. TNN
