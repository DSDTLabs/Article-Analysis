 who is known for his realistic films like ‘Aamir’, ‘No One Killed Jessica’ and ‘Raid’ says that it was only after passing the tenth standard that he started watching films. Even though he grew up during a time when commercial cinema had a major influence on one and all, he admits that the one filmmaker whose films shaped his style and narratives was  . Stressing on Ramu’s ability to tell stories by not succumbing to prevalent ways of storytelling at that time, Gupta says, “Growing up, the one filmmaker who changed the way I looked at cinema was Ram Gopal Varma. I was moved by the films that he made. He made me believe that one can make films on real subjects without stars. Having said that, I also respect filmmakers who have directed films without stars before him. But, he influenced me immensely because he empowered a lot of artistes including writers, directors and actors. If you watched films in the late 1990s and in the early half of 2000, his realistic narratives would have invariably left a deep impact.” 

  The filmmaker will be directing   in ‘India's Most Wanted’, yet again a story based on a real incident. The shoot begins in August this year.
