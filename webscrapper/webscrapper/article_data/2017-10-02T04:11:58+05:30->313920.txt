BHUBANESWAR: A family from  , in a rare example of communal harmony, continued its 350-year-old tradition of observing   on Sunday.

 The family from   in   may be Hindu, but it has been an example in spreading communal harmony since 1664 by taking out a tazia, a replica of the tomb of Imam Hussain, annually to commemorate Muharram.
 
 According to members of the Padhiary family, the tradition of taking out the tazia to commemorate Muharram was started by their ancestor Jayadeb Padhiary, who had fled home to escape an arranged marriage. During his travels, Jayadeb landed in Mecca, where he not only found refuge, but also came in contact with a culture he would grow to love. He returned home after a few years with two maulanas, or learned Muslim leaders, and sought permission from the then ruler of Sambalpur to commemorate Muharram with a tazia procession.
 
 Sambalpur King Chhatra Sai agreed to Jayadeb’s request and the Padhiary family started the annual tradition of observing Muharram. “Like my forefathers, we take out a tazia every year,” said Rajendra Padhiary.
 
 The Padhiary family organises the event without any help. The family makes the tazia itself and the neighbours join in the Muharram procession. The city sees in the family an example of communal harmony.
 
 “Sambalpur is perhaps the only place in the country where a Hindu family sets out with the tazia,” said a resident, Ashok Pradhan.
