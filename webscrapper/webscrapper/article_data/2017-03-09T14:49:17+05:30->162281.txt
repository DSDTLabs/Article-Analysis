The alleged molestations that took place on MG Road on New Year’s Eve struck a chord with rapper  , who goes by the stage name A.V.P. He was offended after seeing a meme soon after that was on the lines of someone’s safety being based on their looks, after which he decided to create some content on the topic. When he saw the trailer of   H Eshwarappa’s  , Aditya thought that it would be a good combine. That’s when Adarsh decided to change his plans of having just one song in the film, to now having two.

 The song, titled Shuddhi, is about the stereotypes that women face, and is inspired by the things that Aditya has witnessed on an everyday basis. “I have split the song into two verses — the first is all about the stereotypes and the second is about hope,” says Aditya.
 
 Accompanying him on the track is  , who wrote the hook with Aditya. “We have adapted the hook from three vachanas — two of Basavanna’s vachanas and one Purandaradasa ugabhoga — so that the message would be stronger and the reach wider. When Aditya approached me, I was happy that a man was thinking about women’s safety, which has become a rarity these days. I was blown away with Shuddhi’s trailer, and being a woman, wanted to help in any which way I could,” says Sparsha.
 
 
 
 The other song from the film, a remix of the popular devotional song Aigiri Nandini, that was released online recently, is interesting since music composer Nobin Paul ensured that he had mostly women working on the song, from the singers to the musicians. “The theme of the movie is such that this song fits in seamlessly. Being a women-oriented movie, we ensured that we had several women onboard for the making. While   is the violinist, her sister, Madhura KV, is the flautist. Madhura’s daughter, Abhinandini, has sung the song with two other singers, Pooja and Meghana. That apart,   has sung the male bits,” says Nobin.
