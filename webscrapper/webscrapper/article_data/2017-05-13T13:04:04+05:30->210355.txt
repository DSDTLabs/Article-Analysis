PANAJI: The public works department (PWD) has reclassified some sections of highways passing through the state as district roads. The move has been made to include major bypass roads as part of the national highways.

 In its circular, the department has explained that while roads passing through the state were declared as highways from 1971 to 1998. During and after this period, many new bypass roads were constructed around towns where expansion and widening was not possible.
 
 “The new bypasses on commissioning and opening to traffic have become a part of the national highway network,” the circular reads, adding that the old roads have been handed over to the state’s jurisdiction.
 
 The move will not bring any respite to liquor store owners along these stretches. “It won’t have any impact on the situation of liquor store owners as these roads were not considered while cancellation of licences was carried out by the excise department,” Dattaprasad  , president of the All Goa Liquor Trader’s association told  , adding that they have been assured by the government the de-notification for their cause will also be initiated soon.
 
 As per the department, bypass roads around Mapusa, St Cruz, Goa Velha, Verna, Ribandar, Mardol, Ponda and   have been incorporated into the national highway network, forming a part of National Highway 17 and National Highway 4-A accordingly.
 
 The association members will be meeting chief minister Manohar Parriakr on Saturday to request him to start the de-notification process before May 15, by when the model code of conduct for the panchayat elections may come into force.
 
 “We are hoping that our demands are attended to before the code of conduct comes into place. After that the government won’t be able to do anything for over a month,” Naik said.
