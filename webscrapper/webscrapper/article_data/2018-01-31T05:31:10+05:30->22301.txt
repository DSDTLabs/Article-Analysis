KOLKATA: The air that you inhale inside the warmth of your home could be as poisonous or even worse than the outdoor air, warns a study conducted by a group of city environmentalists and the Calcutta University’s economics department. It has found the indoor air quality (IAQ) or the pollution level inside homes in some city areas to be three times higher than the permissible limit.

 
 
  
 
 
 Indoor pollution is generated by sources that emit gases or particles into the air and trigger IAQ-driven diseases. “Inadequate ventilation and cooking emission are the main causes of poor IAQ,” said Sudipto Modok, secretary, World for Better Living, the NGO which along with another agency, SMG-Hi, and students and teachers of CU’s economics department have detected an extremely high area-average of PM 2.5 based on the reading of several flats in Kudghat, Behala, Sovabazar, Salt Lake and  .
 
 The study conducted inside four and five-storey apartment buildings shows a whopping increase in indoor pollution since 2014. For instance, the PM 2.5 count in Haridebpur (Kudghat) was mapped at 160mg/m3 in 2014. In December, 2017, the count rose to 180. At   (Moulali), the average PM2.5 level was 190mg/m3 in 2014. In 2017, the count rose to 210 mg/m3.
