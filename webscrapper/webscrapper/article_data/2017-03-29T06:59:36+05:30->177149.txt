AHMEDABAD: Monday was the hottest day in March in the last seven years with mercury soaring to 42.8 degree Celsius. But in police stations across the state, the atmosphere sizzled for a different reason altogether. Clueless cops struggled to come to terms with the DGP's missive to remove   from police stations, and that too within 10 days. The message, dated March 27, was faxed by the state police control room to all police commissioners and district superintendents of police. 

 While the Surat police commissioner had recently issued a similar notification, the notification on Monday, from the state DGP, will affect all 627 police stations in the state.
 
 The notification read, 'It has come to the notice of the DGP that in police stations located in both urban and rural areas many police station in-charges (police inspectors/ police sub-inspectors) install ACs - either donated by members of public, or unofficially."
 
 The notification made clear, "As the ranks are not entitled for AC offices, the use of equipment not only adds to the electricity bill of the police station but also prompts many station in-charges of not going out in their non-AC vehicles."
 
 The notification further mentions that such ACs must be removed with immediate effect and it is the responsibility of the city/district police chief to prevent their re-installation.
 
 The notification justifies the move by stating that it would prompt the station in-charges to patrol their areas to  . The notification also asks for details of removed ACs with each police station's name, when it was installed, who got it installed and date of removal.
 
 While state DGP   was not available for comment, Mohan Jha, ADGP (administration) did not divulge details of who is entitled for AC offices in  . "There are norms of the matter but ranks of inspectors and sub-inspectors are not included. You can refer to the circular," he said.
