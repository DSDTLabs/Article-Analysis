 “At present, operation and maintenance expenses of the projects in the city is about Rs 1,200 crore per annum but we will try and bring it down to Rs 800 crore,” claimed Desai. 
 
 BJP also announced continuation of rebate on advance tax payment. People who pay full advance tax will be given 15% rebate in April and 10% in May. Further, 10% rebate for senior citizens will also continue.
