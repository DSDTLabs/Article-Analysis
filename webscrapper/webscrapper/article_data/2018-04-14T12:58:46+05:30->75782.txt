VADODARA: Donkeys, the sole means of transporting goods on  , remained in their sheds with the stalemate over district administration insisting on the animals carrying weight within prescribed limits continuing. 

 Officials have started engaging both the donkey owners as well as shopkeepers from   to find a solution.
 
 Movement of goods on the Pavagadh hill came to a standstill with donkey owners stopping work. Donkeys are the only means of transportation after   that is halfway up the hill.
 
 The district administration had earlier this week decided that The Prevention of Cruelty to Draught and Pack Animals Rules should be implemented strictly. A load more than 50kg cannot be carried on a donkey under these rules. Medical examination of the donkeys had also revealed that 11 of them were not fit and should be given rest.
 
 Sanjay Rana, a donkey owner, said, “The district administration had called us to understand our difficulties. They have made some suggestions and are insisting that we should start carrying loads other than gas cylinders and coconuts that are practically difficult to carry within the prescribed limits” Rana said that presently, the donkey owners were not in the favour of resuming work immediately and would hold meeting with the traders before doing so.
 
 Pavagadh deputy sarpanch and an eatery owner Ashok Joshi said that even the interest of those having businesses on the hill needed to be taken care of. He added that items like gas cylinders and coconuts also needed to be transported and a way out needed to be found out for transporting these.
 
 The district administration meanwhile agreed to some demands of the donkey owners. These include facilities of drinking water and shades for the donkeys. Presently no such facilities exist on the hill. The persons accompanying the donkeys have to arrange for water for the animals.
