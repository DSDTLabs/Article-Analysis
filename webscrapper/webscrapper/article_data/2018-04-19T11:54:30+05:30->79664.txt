VELLORE: A day after a 16-year-old girl was found dead under mysterious circumstances, police on Wednesday arrested the girl’s lover for murdering her. An inquiry into the case revealed that the youth strangulated the girl after she demanded that he marry her as she was pregnant.

On interrogation, the youth confessed to the crime and divulged that he and the girl had been in a relationship. He had also developed a physical relationship with the girl.
 
 “The girl told Ranjith that she was pregnant and demanded that he marry her soon. In a bid to get rid of her, he stayed with the girl for a while and waited for an opportunity to murder her,” said a police officer.
 
 When the girl was combing her hair around 4.30pm on Monday, the youth strangulated her using the wire of a cell phone charger and disappeared from the spot. “Scientific evidence lifted from the scene, phone calls and the statement of the youth helped crack the case,” added the officer.
