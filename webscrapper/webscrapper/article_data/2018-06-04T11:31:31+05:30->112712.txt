CHENNAI: The police arrested a four-member gang in connection with a case in which a jewellery maker fell off his motorbike and died near the office of the police commissioner late on Friday. It is believed the deceased was chasing a gang that is suspected to have robbed him. 

 The deceased, M Rangarajan, 68, was a resident of Trichy. On May 25, around 10.30pm, he reportedly procured gold from a jeweller in Sowcarpet and was on his way to Egmore to take a train back home. When he reached EVK Sampath Road, one of the assailants Raj Kumar, snatched the bag of gold and fled. Rangarajan chased the gang but when he neared the police commissioner's office, he lost control of his bike, fell and died of his injuries, the police said.
 
 Initially, the Anna Square traffic investigation wing registered a road accident case. But when Rangarajan's son reached the city and discovered his father's bag was missing, the case took a turn. A case of   related death was registered.
 
 Police then began analysing the CCTV camera footage and chanced upon Mahinder, an employee at a jewellery shop in Washermenpet. Mahinder was familiar with Rangarajan's weekly trips and conspired to ambush him. Men in four bikes stationed at different locations kept an eye on the jeweller and snatched his bag at an isolated spot. 
 
 The arrested were identified as Mahinder, 35, of Vinayagapuram, repeat offender Raj Kumar, 32, of Vyasarpadi, Anand and Mohammad Siddique, both 28 from Royapuram. Police are on the look out for four more people - 'Spencer' Rehman, Peter, Noor and Imran and are yet to recover the jewellery.
