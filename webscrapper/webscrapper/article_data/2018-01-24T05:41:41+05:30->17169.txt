MUMBAI: The Bombay   on Tuesday pulled up the BMC over an order in the   passed by a senior officer that appeared to favour a private builder.

 A division bench of justices   and Pradeep Deshmukh expressed “shock” at the order by a deputy municipal commissioner they termed “prima facie illegal”.
 
 The bench admitted the petitions filed by a   compound resident and the building societies, but gave an opportunity to municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta to look into the issue and make corrections.
 
 The court scheduled the petitions for final hearing on March 6, but said that if the civic chief felt the order was illegal then he could order for the matter to be heard afresh.
 
 “Prima facie it appears the DMC (Improvements) has passed the orders which he could not have passed,” said the judges, adding “the officer has virtually permitted the transfer of rights in favour of the builder.”
 
 The court said the issue before the DMC was limited to deciding if the 999-year lease of the Campa Cola compound, granted to the company Pure Drinks, should be terminated over alleged violation of lease conditions.
 
 “The officer, instead of deciding the issue in his orders, approved the sublease granted illegally to a private builder of the portion of the land and directed the division of the plot which could have only been done with permission of the standing committee,” claimed advocate Pradeep Havnur, counsel for petitioner Chandru Khemlani.
 
 The court remarked it was “shocked to note the DMC had issued directives to the BMC and federation of six buildings to file consent terms in the high court and withdraw a petition.”
 
 The Campa Cola compound in Worli had waded into controversy after the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of 35 illegal floors housing around 100 flats.
 
 In 2015, the apex court provided a reprieve to the residents by giving them time to approach the state government to regularize their illegal apartments.
