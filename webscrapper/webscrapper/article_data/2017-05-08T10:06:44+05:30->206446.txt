HYDERABAD: The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) held on Sunday saw 97% attendance in the city with 56,804 candidates writing the examination in English and Telugu. Several students found the question paper to be tougher than last year. Also, those who wrote the exam in Telugu were left perplexed at the way several questions were framed. 

 "Several questions in Physics were not framed properly in Telugu. It seemed as if they had been directly translated from English. Some of them had grammatical errors and typos too. I had to read the questions repeatedly to make head or tail of it," said Vennapusu Kiran, a candidate who came to Hyderabad from Bidar just to write the exam in Telugu. This was the first time that the test was conducted in the regional language.
 
 Candidates who took the test in English, meanwhile, found the questions to be slightly tougher. "In Chemistry, one question on science substitution was a tough nut to crack. There were also four to five questions in Biology that were not from the textbooks prescribed by the NCERT (National Council for Educational Research and Training)," said  , a candidate at Kendriya Vidyalaya in Trimulgherry.
 
 Industry experts also said the paper was tougher when compared to last year, with changes in the Biology section. "Many questions, particularly in Biology, were beyond the NCERT textbooks. This comes as a warning to future NEET aspirants as they might require additional training. This year, more emphasis was laid on application-based questions in all the three subjects," said  , director of Aakash Educational Services Pvt. Ltd.
 
 Experts from Toppr.com said that question number 87 of Chemistry in Set R didn't have any correct options.
 
 The students will get to know how they fared in the exam when the results are declared by the Central Board of Secondary Education on June 8.
