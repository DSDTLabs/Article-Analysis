Margao: The Goa state mahila   president Pratima Coutinho on Friday demanded that the state government take immediate steps to provide alternative employment to mining dependent people. 

 Coutinho told reporters that as lakhs of people would be deprived of their livelihood on account of the mining closure, the government should generate employment and provide them with jobs. 
 
 “In case the government is unable to do this, the MLAs of the ruling party and those supporting the government should resign,” she said. 
 
  Coutinho said that that the hardships faced by the public during this week’s protest were “unintentional”. She added, “Their livelihoods are at stake and the government didn’t take any perceivable steps to solve the crisis.”
