AHMEDABAD: Sanand Industries Association (SIA) has now knocked on the doors of the chief minister, over the issue of land allotment and penalty for non-utilization of plots allotted to them in the Sanand industrial estate. SIA has sought the intervention of CM Vijay Rupani, urging him to change the dates of allotment for the plots given to them by   ( ). 

 The letter from the association also states that if their demands are not met within a month, industrialists will surrender their plots and shift their projects out of Gujarat. GIDC officials, however, claim that the issue has already been taken up and is likely to be resolved soon.
 
 SIA representatives allege that while they got allotment letters in 2012, there was no basic infrastructure including water or electricity connection and road connectivity till 2015, in absence of which they could not begin construction or get into production and now are forced to pay non-utilization penalty.
 
 “We have written to the chief minister, urging him to change the date of allotment of our plots. We hope for a fruitful resolution,” said Ajit Shah, president, SIA, adding that the industrialists have still kept the option of shifting projects to Madhya Pradesh open.
 
 Shah added, “If our issues are not resolved within a month, we may surrender our plots and shift base to MP. We’ve held a series of talks with the MP government and they’re ready to allot us land plots to begin our business and we’re considering it positively.”
 
 Earlier this week, a meeting was held between SIA members and GIDC officials to discuss the issue. When queried, D Thara, managing director, GIDC, said, “We’ve received some applications and will get some more by next week. We will evaluate each case individually and also look at when infrastructure was developed.”
