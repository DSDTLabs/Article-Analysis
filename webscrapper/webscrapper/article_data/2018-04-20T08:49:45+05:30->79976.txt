MADURAI: Retired IAS officer R  , who is probing the   scandal — in which assistant professor   allegedly tried to persuade four girl students to offer sexual favours to top officials — on Thursday appointed two women members to assist him. 

 Santhanam, who was appointed by Governor Banwarilal Purohit, arrived here on Thursday morning and summoned the vice-chancellor of Madurai Kamaraj University, Dr P Chellathurai, and registrar Dr V Chinnaiah, to the circuit house. The inquiry with the top university officials went on till 1.30 p.m. 
 
 Later, talking to reporters, Santhanam said that he had appointed Dr Kamali, dean research, Mother Theresa University, Kodaikanal, and professor Dr S Thiyageswari, professor and head of the department of soil and environment, Agriculture College and Research Institute, to assist him in the inquiry. ``They will help me with the process and inquiries to be made with the students and teachers,’’ he said.
 
 He said that women members had been appointed from institutes outside MKU for the sake of propriety. The commission would inquire into the background of the issue.
 
  ``The attempt is to find the truth and there are different ways to approach it,’’ he said. Santhanam added that he also planned to seek permission to visit professor Nirmala Devi at the Madurai central prison either on Saturday or next week. The commission would visit Aruppukottai Devanga Arts College on Friday and Madurai Kamaraj University on Saturday. The members would meet the officers and members of the various associations connected with the university. 
 
 A second phase of inquiry would also be conducted, he added. The commission would hold sittings in Madurai on April 21, 25 and 26 between 10 am and 1.30 pm during which period those wishing to make representations in the case could do so.
