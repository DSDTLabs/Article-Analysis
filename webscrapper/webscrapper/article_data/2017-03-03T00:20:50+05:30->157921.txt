NEW DELHI: A video shot on “Kashmir Day” in Pakistan on February 5 has had Indian intelligence agencies on their toes. In the video, accessed by TOI, Jamat-Ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed’s son, Talha, is seen inciting a crowd to wage war against India using   Ibrahim’s name.

 This is the first time that a Pakistan-based terror outfit has made a direct reference to the don.
 
 Talha asks the crowd if they wanted to become a judge, police or doctors to which the crowd says no. Talha then asks them if they would want to become Dawood and the crowd shouts, saying yes. Talha then goes on to ask them if they want to become  , and again gets an “yes” from the crowd. The agencies are now probing if D Company and JuD are operating in collusion.
