Actor   says there is nothing worth doing on television nowadays and hence, it does not hurt her to reject the shows that come her way.

 Singh, who is still remembered for her work in the sitcom " " (2003), has reduced her small screen outing over the last few years, and she blames it on the regressive content on TV.
 
 "It is not progressive anymore for sure. There are the kind of shows I don't want to be a part of, and I hope TV sees the same days that it saw when we started. I really don't know what went wrong with TV. The good shows are not being made or they are shut too early," the actor told PTI.
 
 Singh says she can not pinpoint the exact reason why the quality of shows started dwindling over the years.
 
 "I don't know what people really want to see. There are just mythological shows, which I don't want to see. I saw them when I was growing up. I saw ' ' and ' ', but that is not what I want to see now. I don't know what's wrong with TV. Maybe the channels are not willing to take a rish, to try out something new," she adds.
 
 In this scenario, when an actor does not have many options in TV, Singh says she has no qualms in turning down a show.
 
 "The first thing that my father taught me was to say no. It is the most difficult thing to do because we can't please everybody. I am a very choosy actor and I prefer quality over quantity, that's why I have done very few shows but all those shows are remembered till now.
 
 "I don't feel bad in saying no. I take pride in saying no because I don't want to do them. I don't want to pretend and make someone else happy by saying yes. I think of myself as an actor and what they have to offer to me. If the offer is good enough, I take it up," she says.
 
 Singh, who has done only six shows in 15 years of her television career, is now excited about her foray into the digital space.
