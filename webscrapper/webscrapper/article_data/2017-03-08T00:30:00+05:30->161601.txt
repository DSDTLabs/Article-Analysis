Bengaluru: An alleged theft of the cellphone of a woman inmate of a paying guest accommodation at AECS Layout of east Bengaluru early in Sunday morning kicked up a debate on the social media. The woman’s friend posted on Facebook that the intruder attempted to molest her but the PG owner was refusing to cooperate in the probe.

 A complaint was registered by the PG owner on Sunday that a man, armed with a knife, entered the paying guest facility and made way with the woman’s cellphone. The incident took place around 2am. Once the man entered her room with the knife, the woman escaped by locking herself in the bathroom.
 
 Hours after the complaint was filed, her friend Prince Shah posted the incident on Facebook, claiming that the man tried to molest his friend. “She saw the CCTV footage where a stranger was coming to the building through the terrace. The PG guy is not sharing the footage, saying its normal for girls to be assaulted,” he had claimed.
 
 “The PG owner has come to us with a complaint of a mobile phone theft as the woman is leaving the city for another job,” said Hemanth Nimbalkar, additional commissioner of police, east, who said further details of the case are being verified.
