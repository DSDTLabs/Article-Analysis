COIMBATORE: Computer science teachers of the government higher secondary schools have decided to boycott evaluation of Class XI public examination answer papers after the education department refused to reduce the number of papers to be evaluated per session.

 In a circular issued in February, the department directed that about 15 computer science answer papers should be evaluated per session, while it was 12 for language and vocational subjects and 10 for other subjects. After requests from the vocational teachers, the number of papers per session was reduced from 12 to 10.
 
 In case of Class XII, the students would be taking 75 one-mark questions on OMR sheets which the teachers need not evaluate. “So we do not have any issue correcting more number of papers than other subject teachers. We corrected 20 papers last year,” said a teacher.
 
 But, the Class XI students have 70-mark practical examinations in all the subjects. “While mathematics and vocational subjects teachers have to correct only 10 papers, Why we should evaluate 15 answer sheets,” asked M  , state coordinator of   higher secondary school computer teachers association
 
 Meanwhile, according to the sources in the school education department, the number of papers was decided based on the number of students taking the examination and time available for evaluation. While more than four lakh Class XI students are taking computer science examination, there are only 1,900 teachers in government schools, in addition to a few thousand teachers from government-aided and private schools. tnn
