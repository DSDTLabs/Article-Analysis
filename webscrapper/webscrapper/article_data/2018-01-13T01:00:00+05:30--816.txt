 is not your typical   singer. Synonymous with cult songs in the Hindi film industry — right from ‘Chhaiyya Chhaiyya’ (Dil Se, 1998), ‘Ramta Jogi’ ('Taal', 1999), ' ' (' ', 2008) to 'Udi Udi Jaaye' ('Raees', 2017), the earthy-voiced, versatile singer is now looking at radio jockeying. 

 He says, “All through my career, I have used my voice to connect with audiences and people, be it through music or interaction. But coming on to a dedicated platform like radio jockeying, which has a charm of its own, it is extremely fun to talk about interesting things in music on it. It is a medium that has remained special to me from the start.”
 
 He believes that this additional career will add a lot to his life and help him connect to his fans in an even better way. “When the motto is to reach out to as many people as possible with my voice, how does it matter if it is singing or speaking? In fact, it will create a double impact,” he states.
 
 Every year, the Hindi film music industry witnesses the emergence of talented new singers, yet, Sukhwinder continues to be sought after because of his skills in music, knowledge of the nuances of notes, and his non-conventional voice quality. 
 
 RJ-ing is, however, a different ball-game. So, is he preparing himself for it? “It’s not like I’m preparing for a career in radio. Since I am a fun loving person, speaking to people comes naturally to me. So, not much preparation was required there,” he quips.
 
 Interacting with fans on the radio — what does it entail? “I think in a live performance we have a lot more time to build a connection with the audience. In radio, I think we have to be much more precise and quick in speaking the right way, so the connect builds faster. Both mediums are different and challenging in their own ways.”
