Chennai has always been at the forefront when it comes to acknowledging women achievers. This event was organised to congratulate women whoâ€™ve made the city proud in many ways. It was attended by inspiring folks from different walks of life. And what jazzed up the evening do was the fashion show. It saw several top models like Aishvarya and Mehndi walking the ramp. Most of them sported flowing garbs, bandana and chunky accessories. And their oversized red bindis gave a unique twist to their overall appearance. And we must say that even male models like Karthik and Ramesh nailed their bindi-looks.
