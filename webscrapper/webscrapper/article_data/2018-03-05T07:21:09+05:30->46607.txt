CHANDIGARH : Punjab Congress president   said on Sunday that by calling chief minister   an “independent soldier”, Prime Minister   had acknowledged the “free and democratic culture” prevailing in the Congress.

 Besides, he added, the Prime Minister had also recognised the self-respecting and independent character of Punjabis represented by the CM. “This is quite contrary to the autocratic and dictatorial culture prevailing in the   (BJP) under Modi, where saner and seasoned voices like those of L K Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Yashwant Sinha and   have either been silenced or banished to the Marg Darshak Mandal,” Jakhar said in a statement.
 
 
 Asserting that the Congress needed no certificate from the BJP about watching the interests of Punjab, Jakhar challenged him that if he was really such a well wisher of Punjab, he should reimburse Rs 31,000 crore that was siphoned by the previous state government in which his party (BJP) was an alliance partner, which was blindly overlooked by the Centre.
