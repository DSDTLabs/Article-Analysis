KOLKATA: Sacrifice, of the kind shown in yesteryear  , could be likened to  : throwing this imagery at the audience on the  , writer   went on to discuss why   continued to rule our heads and hearts despite its apparent lunacy. 

 She, along with Rachel Dwyer and Jerry Pinto, was a panelist at the Apeejay Kolkata Literary Festival for a session, “Of Stardust and Tinseltown: Writing Bollywood”. 
 
 They discussed how Hindi films had changed, from being loud and theatrical with dialogues dripping with emotional excess, to ones closer to life. In attaining this maturity, Bollywood films were inching closer towards Hollywood, speakers felt. “It is a whole new parallel form of cinema that is leaving us completely awestruck. For example, ‘Dangal’. How exquisitely, Aamir Khan has brought to life a story of living characters. Not an iota of exaggeration...,” De said.
 
 While you have ‘Dangal’ and ‘Bhaag Milkha Bhaag’, you cannot deny the impact that big panorama films, like ‘Ramleela’ and ‘Baji Rao Mastani’, have on the Indian audience. “They are of two different spectrums but they co-exist and can excite imaginations across age groups and social strata,” De said. 
 
 As the talks moved towards dialogues in Hindi films, De and Pinto pointed out how the imageries of what made someone badchalan (dishonest) or equating purity with virginity have changed. Sacrifice was the mainstay of yesteryear films so much so a weird scene of blood being transfused directly did not seem bizarre. “You may liken such imageries of sacrifice to demonetisation. Today, you have a film (‘Piku’), where a father declares his daughter was not a virgin. Where except in Bollywood will you get such a mind-blowing idea that revolves around a constipated father?” De said.
