ERODE: A 35-year-old woman was arrested for murdering a seven-year-old girl with whose mother her husband allegedly had an affair.

 The deceased was identified as S  , of   village near  . She was a Class II student of a government school.
 
 According to her parents, she had gone outside the house to play on Saturday evening. When she suddenly disappeared, her parents  , 39, and S  . 32, launched a search for her and found her body with wounds at a deserted place a few metres away from the house. 
 
 The girl’s parents lodged a complaint with the Perundurai police, who registered a case and initiated an inquiry. Preliminary postmortem report, meanwhile, revealed that the girl was strangulated to death. “The murderer had also severely beaten up the girl using wooden logs,” an investigation officer said. 
 
 Preliminary investigation revealed that the girl’s neighbour K  , 35, was seen taking the girl with her on Saturday evening. When the police questioned her, she confessed to the crime.
 
 Vanitha told the police that the girl’s father was an alcoholic and her mother used to quarrel with him. Whenever the two picked up a fight, Vanitha’s husband Kamalakkannan used to pacify the couple. “At one stage, Kamalakkannan and the girl’s mother developed an affair and he used to financially help her,” the officer said.
