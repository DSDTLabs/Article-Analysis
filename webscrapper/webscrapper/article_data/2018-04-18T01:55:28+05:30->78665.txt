NAGPUR/PUNE: A team of Pune   conducted a seven-hour search and seizure operation at the Nagpur home of lawyer-activist Surendra Gadling on Tuesday in connection with Koregaon-Bhima violence earlier this year.

  Gadling had appeared as defense counsel for several Maoist activists like GN Saibaba and others.
 
 Protesting the raids, Gadling said cops had taken away all his research material along with case files and court verdicts that he had gathered over last 25 years to compile a book. “They came in 10 to 15 vehicles, it is clear they want to intimidate us for following our ideology,” he said. He said the police were not acting against Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote, who he claimed were the main culprits behind the Koregaon-Bhima violence. The action was initiated in connection with the   of incitement registered at Vishrambagh police station in Pune in February this year against hordes of activists for their alleged role in triggering violence.
 
 Cops also simultaneously raided five more places including the residence of Delhi-based activist Rona Wilson. The homes of Gadling’s relative Sudhir Dhawale, his partner Harshali Potdar, workers of Republican Panthers in Mumbai were also being searched. In Pune, three places of activists associated with Kabir Kala Manch were being raided by a separate team of Pune police. The searches were conducted to recover documents from the possession of the suspects whose role behind the Koregaon-Bhima violence is under scanner. The security agencies had earlier linked the activists of Republican Panthers and Kabir Kala Manch with the banned outfit of Communist Party of India (Maoist).
 
  Meanwhile, Rahul Fatangale’s family has demanded the immediate arrest of the prime suspects in his murder and have threatened to go on an indefinite fast. Fatangale died in the violence that gripped Koregaon-Bhima on January 1.
