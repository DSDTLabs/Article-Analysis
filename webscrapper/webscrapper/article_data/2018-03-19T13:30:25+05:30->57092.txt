Senior actor   who shares the screen space with Thalapathy   in his upcoming magnum opus as an antagonist rained his words of praise over Vijay.

 In one of his interviews, Radha Ravi says that he has already worked with Vijay in four films. “Vijay is a very simple man. The way Vijay appreciates and encourages other actors is commendable,” he says. Talking about his shooting experiences with Vijay, he adds, “I have great scenes with Vijay in the film. He is a big star and has every right to demand the makers to complete his portions first but Vijay patiently sleeps on the floor until the director finishes off sequences of others. He doesn’t go to his caravan. He instead lies down within the sets somewhere where ever he finds it comfortable. And stars like him would never do that.”
 
 He also says that director   is a humble person that extracts work without pressurizing the cast and crew. “He doesn’t put on airs. Instead he makes us feel so comfortable in the sets. I think because of this quality of the director and Vijay that Lakshmi (money) comes to them unreluctantly,” adds Radha Ravi who plays a politician in the film.
 
 The yet-to-title film has Keerthy Suresh, Varalakshmi and Yogi Babu in prominent roles. The film being produced by Sun Pictures, the music is composed by AR Rahman.
