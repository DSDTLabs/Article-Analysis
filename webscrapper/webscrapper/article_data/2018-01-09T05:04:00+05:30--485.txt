 Chennai: Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Monday took the House by surprise with his love for Tamil. He began his hour-long speech with a ‘Vanakkam’, later New Year greetings in Tamil and ended it with Pongal greetings too in Tamil. When DMK leader M K Stalin stood up to raise certain issues, Purohit pleaded with the leader to remain seated, “please utkarunga, utkarunga (sit down)”, sending the house into peals of laughter. The governor told Stalin he would have a lot of opportunities to raise several issues during the debate. A Raj Bhavan press release in November said the governor was taking lessons in Tamil from a teacher because of his flair and love for Tamil and his keen interest in learning the ‘classical and beautiful’ language.
