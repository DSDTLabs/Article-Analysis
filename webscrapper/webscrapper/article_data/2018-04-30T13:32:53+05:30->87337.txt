TIRUPUR : The rural police have registered more than 30 cases against farmers for tapping toddy illegally at   and   areas here in past few days.

 The state government had recently lifted the ban on neera (sweet toddy) tapping, but many farmers in the district are involved in toddy tapping, which is completely banned, the police said.
 
 Based on a tip, the police searched Therkupalayam and   areas near Palladam and found that illegal toddy tapping was rampant. They also seized pots and ladders used for the purpose.
 
 “The police have destroyed many pots. We have met Palladam MLA A   and urged him to protect the farmers and allow toddy tapping,” said K Thangavel of Katchi Sarbatra Vivasaigal Sangam.
 
 The farmers, meanwhile, met the Kangeyam deputy superintendent of police, R  , and requested him to return the seized articles, but in vain.
 
 The Kangeyam police have registered cases against 29 farmers, while the Mangalam police have booked seven others for the illegal toddy tapping.
