BENGALURU: The cash crunch on Tuesday continued to plague Bengalureans on Wednesday too. Many complained that banks have replaced 'no cash' boards outside many ATMs with 'out of service' or 'out of order' boards to escape the wrath of customers . 

 "It's common to see one or two ATMs having 'out of service' boards. But how can all ATMs of different banks in one area  ?" asked Deepthi A, software engineer from southeast Bengaluru.
 
 A security guard at an   kiosk in north Bengaluru said: "As directed by   officials, we changed the boards. We're telling customers that the kiosks have developed snags." 
 
  ATMs with cash witnessed long queues. "There are nearly 20 ATMs in Jayanagar Block 9, but only two are dispensing cash. Some are drawing more cash using different cards," said Rajat, a  . 
 
 "Bank branches across the city are facing cash shortage. In such situations, we go to head offices as they distribute cash meant for ATMs," a   told TOI.
