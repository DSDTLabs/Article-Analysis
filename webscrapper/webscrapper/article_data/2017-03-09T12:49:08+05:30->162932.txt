ALLAHABAD: With final exams round the corner, including those of  , UP Board,   and  , it is going to be stressful for students between the ages of 14 and 20. 

 "Examinees should sleep well, at least for six hours. They should take a 15-minute break after every hour of study," suggests KV, Old Cantt principal, Shalini Dikshit. "Worrying about the exams is pointless as it stresses one out and inhibits performance," she added. 
 
 "An improper diet can add to tension," said Prof Manisha Dwivedi, former head, department of gastroentrology, MLN Medical College, Allahabad. "Students should have small and frequent meals. Plenty of fruits and vegetables, idli, poha, green tea, coconut water, amla juice, bhel and rotis can be had," she suggested. 
 
 Dr Bhoomika R Kar of the Centre of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences, Allahabad University, said having a dedicated place of study that is well lit, relatively free from distractions, making a timetable, allotting time for each subject and combining one difficult subject with an easy one, are some of the things that would help students, she added.
