PUNE: The sudden closure of  's all time payment ( ) machine on NIBM   in Kondhwa since April 1 has severely inconvenienced consumers.
The machine was installed to enable power consumers to pay bill round the clock. It was closed following the expiry of the tender of power utility contractor.
 
 The consumers have demanded that additional cash counters be opened to tackle rush during peak hours.
 
 NIBM Road resident Abdul Khalid Patwekar said, “I have been making rounds of MSEDCL offices for the past three days to pay the bill but could not do so as the queues are very long. I would have paid the bill if the machine was functioning as it would have saved my time. It will help if two more additional cash counters are opened for the convenience of consumers.“
 
 Yevalewadi resident Amol Dighe said, “Another ATP machine at Somji bus stop near the Bank of Maharashtra at   is also not functioning for some days.“
 
 Kondhwa resident   said, “It is difficult to stand in queues for long because of the rise in temperature. MSEDCL has not installed fans to beat the summer heat. The cashier also accepts one bill at a time. Consumers having two or more bills face hardships.“
 
 Businessman Pramod Shinde said, “The rush has increased because consumers rush to pay bill at the last moment. If the machine is not working it is the job of the power utility to increase the number of cash counters to provide better services to the people.“ PMC corporator Nanda Lonkar has appealed to MSEDCL officials to reopen the ATP at the earliest. He also urged the power company to open additional counters and extend the deadline to pay bills.
 
 An MSEDCL official said that even though many people had started paying bills online, the number of people wishing to pay bills at ATP machines after office hours has increased because not all of them have net connection. An additional cash counter will be opened soon to cope with the rush.“
