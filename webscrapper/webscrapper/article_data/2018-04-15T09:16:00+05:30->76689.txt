LUDHIANA: BJP Punjab president Shwet Malik was fell short of words during his visit here on Saturday as he ducked questions over the rape cases in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh, and Kathua, Jammu and Kashmir. 

 Malik, who was speaking at a press conference at Circuit House here, could only cite PM Narendra Modi’s statement on the rapes, saying that the accused would not be spared and the two girls would get justice. Once he made the statement, Malik went on to attack the Congress, saying that it had been conspiring against the saffron party. “It has been saying that the BJP diluted the SC/ST Act, but it is the   which has taken decisons on the law.,” he said. 
 
 He said the BJP had done “great things” for the rehabilitation of depressed classes, but the Congress saw them as a vote bank and did not let them progress.
 
 Malik said the Congress was finding it difficult to manage its MLAs in Punjab. “The state government will collapse shortly. Cabinet ministers and MLAs do not trust CM Amarinder Singh; that is why they keep on demanding ministrial berths. Even Congress leaders like Pratap Bajwa have declared Amarinder’s government a failure,” he said.
 
 Malik went on to praise policies formulated by the central government, saying that they were for the welfare of the poor and downtrodden. This was Malik’s first visit in the city after taking charge of the party’s top post in the state.
