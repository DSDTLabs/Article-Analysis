THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala  , ( ) has come out with a study on the 'Export competitiveness of Kerala', which has identified sectors ­ including marine products, foodstuff, plywood, textile, rubber, carpets and medical instruments ­ that have the potential for diversification.

  handed over the report, which provides a comprehensive picture of the current state of exports from Kerala and proposes policy measures that would help enhance export competitiveness, to industries minister  .
 
 The study, conducted with the support of   (FIEO), analysed growth prospects of 58 products clusters that account for 90% of Kerala's regular exports and found that 19 items in the export basket were competitive in the world market. “The state has competitive lines in spices, essential oils, rubber-related and carpet products only.But these items accounted for just 20.43% of the state's export revenues in 2014,“ the study said.
 
 It also found that most exports were from pri mary and low-technology sectors and that representation of high-value items was minimum. “Vegetable products, animals and fish together form almost 50% of the exports,“ it said stressing the need to explore new sectors in which Kerala has a competitive advantage.
 
 Besides identifying the sectors including marine products, foodstuff, plywood, textile, rubber, carpets and medical instruments for diversification, the study also stressed on the need to streamline efforts for developing an export basket containing items from electronic, electrical, and engineering `for which world demand is growing'.
 
 The study has classified the product clusters into three categories ­ `Fortune changers' (electronic items, machinery and parts, pharmaceutical items, medical equipment, value-added chemicals, plastic products and essential oils); `Front runners' (jewellery, rubber, coir and wood products, textiles and automobile components) and `Favourites' (traditional products such as coffee, tea, spices, shrimps, natural gums, coconut, coconut oil, marine preparations, meat products, foodstuff and beverages).
 
 Citing Kerala as the 7th largest exporting state in India with a contribution of $4.8 billion in 2015-16 and giving a road map `to achieve its target of 5% share in India's exports over the next five years', the report sought policy initiatives focussing on basic requirements, efficiency enhancers like a welldefined labour policy safeguarding interests of both workers and entrepreneurs, and innovation and sophistication, to boost export competitiveness.
