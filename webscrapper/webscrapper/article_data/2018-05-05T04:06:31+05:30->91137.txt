GURUGRAM: A   student allegedly committed suicide at her home near Sector 15 on Thursday. 

 Police said she had apparently not performed well in the re-test of economics paper conducted by CBSE and was worried about the results. No suicide note has been found, though.
 
 The 18-year-old lived with her family in Kirti Nagar colony and was studying at a renowned school in the city. 
 
 Cops said she went to her room around 7.30pm on Thursday and locked herself in. When her family noticed that she was not around, they went to her room, but found it locked from inside. They broke open the door to find her hanging from a ventilator by a dupatta.
 
 Her relatives said they were devastated and refused to say anything else.
 
 “According to the family, the girl had been upset for the past few days. She was reportedly afraid of getting a bad score in the economics re-exam,” said inspector Narender Khatana, SHO of Civil Lines police station. 
 
 Police handed over the body to kin after the post-mortem and are investigating the case.
