NAGPUR:   (RPF), Nagpur division, has seized separate consignments of liquor from two Chennai-bound trains on Friday worth nearly Rs 2 crore. The liquor was confiscated within a few hours of 110kg of   by the RPF within 24 hours, which has set an unparalleled benchmark so far in the railway security of Nagpur division. 

 The   squad, under the senior divisional security commissioner Jyoti Kumar Satija, had first seized around 70 consignment from GT express and later another 118 from Tamil Nadu express after conducting back-to-back raids exposing an interstate racket of liquor smugglers. 
 
 The consignments, booked from Delhi, were ferried as regular luggage in SLR coaches. RPF sources claimed that around 4,500 liquor bottles of international brands were seized which are generally consumed by upmarket population. The consignments were likely to be taken to some hotels for the news years’ party in Chennai. Both the trains were running abnormally late. 
 
 Satija claimed that the consignees have a contract with railways before sending luggage in SLR coach which are being verified to ascertain whether the liquor was being sent only after completing all the formalities.
 
  “We got the permission to open the consignments from the commercial department and also to go ahead with checking and performing the panchnama of the seized consignment. Meanwhile, the formalities of checking documents of contract are also being carried out to ascertain whether the liquor were being sent as some other luggage or not,” he said. 
 
 Satija also claimed that the process of checking other trains is also underway to intercept illegal consignments of liquor, narcotics and such other consignments, if any. 
 
 The entire process of preparing the panchnama was videographed and conducted in the presence of independent witnesses.
