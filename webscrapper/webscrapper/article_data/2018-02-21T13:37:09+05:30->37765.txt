VADODARA: A police constable posted in   police station committed suicide at his house late on Monday night. 

 Thirty-five-year-old Surjitsinh   ended his life in his room by hanging himself from the fan at about 10.30 pm. The cops believe that illness may have driven him to the drastic step but they are investigating the case. 
 
 According to police, Verma was admitted to a private hospital for last few days. He was discharged on Monday and went to his house in the city police headquarters at Pratapnagar. Verma didn’t look disturbed and according to his family he even took them out for ice-cream on Monday evening. 
 
 On returning home, he went to his room to rest. After sometime, some of his colleagues went to meet him but he didn’t open the door. When they broke inside the room, they saw Verma hanging from the fan. He was immediately rushed to the hospital but the doctors declared him dead on admission. He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter. His father and brother too are serving in the police department. 
 
 Sources in the Sayajigunj police station said that Verma wasn’t behaving normally over last few months. He seemed to be down due to his illness and had stopped interacting much with his colleagues. Verma was on sick leave. A cop in Sayajigunj police station said that he may have taken the extreme step due to his health or family issues but the work pressure too takes a toll of some policemen.
