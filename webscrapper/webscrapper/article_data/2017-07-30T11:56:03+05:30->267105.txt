PANAJI: There was slight respite for consumers from the high cost of tomatoes as prices dropped a bit, from the earlier high of Rs 80 to Rs 70 at the   market.

 At Margaoâ€™s New Market and  , a kilo of tomatoes was being sold for around Rs 60 per kg, on Saturday. 
 
 However, vendors are expecting the prices to go up again on Sunday due to the high demand on the weekend.
 
 Over the past month, the prices of tomatoes have escalated, touching even Rs 100 per kg. Vendors say that they do not see any relief from these high prices of vegetables before Ganesh Chaturthi next month.
 
 Around a fortnight ago, the prices of carrots, too, had skyrocketed to Rs 120 per kg. This has now dropped slightly to Rs 80 per kg.
