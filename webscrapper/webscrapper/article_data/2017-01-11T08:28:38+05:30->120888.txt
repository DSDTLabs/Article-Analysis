UDUPI:  , snake expert, found a treat this New Year: The common   with a different hood mark at Parkala.

 “I have been dealing with snakes for the past 30 years. The Indian cobra varies tremendously in colour and pattern throughout its range and underside pigmentation with grey, yellow, tan, brown, reddish or black. However, I have not found any cobra with a change in the hood mark,“ he said.
 
 “I found this one at the house of   in Parkala. It was a female cobra in beautiful gold and black. She came to the house to find its feed of rats, and was roaming around the area for a week. The people of the house were scared to face it. Ultimately, she found a place to hide, inside the wood store near the kitchen. No one had noticed the hood mark. The house owner contacted me and after clearing the wood from the storehouse, I found she was all set to escape. However, I caught her,“ Sanil said.
 
 “I've saved around 25,000 snakes, of which 15,000 and more were cobras. Cobras can be easily identified if it shows its hood, which bears a rounded or mask shaped mark — a U shape with two circles at the beginning and end which look like eyes. Otherwise, its wide range of pigmentation and bands look close to the rat snake. This one looked different and beautiful with a heart-shaped mark at the back and white plain space in front. The two black dots like eyes in the front was also missing. After being captured, she was left in a safe place.
 
 Explaining the change in the hood mark, he said it depends on the climate and area where it is born. It varies in colour, shape and size. Just like a few animals change their shape and colour while preying, cobras have the capacity to camouflage themselves in nature and attack suddenly.
 
 “These are natural qualities. It is a   which slithers and also climbs trees, depending on its needs,“ Sanil said.
