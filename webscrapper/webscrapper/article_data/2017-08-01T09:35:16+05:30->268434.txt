Following the GST launch, a delegation from different cantonment boards, including PCB, held a special meeting with Ministry of Defence (MoD) authorities and the Director General Defence Estate (DGDE) requesting them to allow cantonments to collect VET.
 
 The ministry of finance on July 25 had issued a special notification signed by Mahendra Nath, Under Secretary, a copy of which is in possession of TOI.
 
 “As per the Cantonment Act, 2006, the cantonments have powers to charge fees under section 67 of the said Act. It may be mentioned that this fees is not a tax and thus would remain unaffected by introduction of GST,” the notification stated.
 
 A senior official from DGDE, New Delhi told TOI over phone, “The cantonments have limited revenue generation avenues. Considering this, the matter was discussed in details with higher ups of the finance ministry and it was decided to allow the cantonments to collect VET for their financially stability.”
 
 The PCB has already awarded a contract to a private agency to collect VET in the cantonment. There are 13 points where the VET will be collected in the PCB jurisdiction, sources said.
