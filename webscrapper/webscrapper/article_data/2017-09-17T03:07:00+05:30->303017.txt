Panaji: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar on Saturday said the government would examine the issue of handing over the multi-crore beach-cleaning scam to the CBI within the stipulated period of three months. This follows the Lokayukta’s advice that the government refer the matter to the country’s premier investigation agency. When asked about the Lokayukta’s recommendation, Parrikar said, “It is such a thick document. The government has, according to the (Lokayukta) Act, 90 days to analyse it and take decisions.” The Goa Lokayukta has found the then tourism minister Dilip Parulekar, guilty of “favouritism”, besides other irregularities, in the beach-cleaning scam, and has recommended that the ACB reopen the case.  In his findings, Lokayukta Justice P K Misra had said Parulekar “had shown indulgence and favouritism” by not acting upon the recommendations made by the tourism director and principal secretary (tourism) and all facts and circumstances apparent from the records produced clearly pointed to it.
