PUNE: A group of female bikers from the city has been breaking barriers since its inception and will soon feature in an international documentary, scheduled for an online release in April. The Bikerni group is the lone participant in the film from the country.

 The co-founder of the all-women riding group   told TOI, “The production team was looking for a group that grew despite challenges. They contacted us in January and said they had found our story inspiring. They wanted to portray our story in their documentary.”
 
 Mumbai’s   shot the Indian segment of the documentary for the UK-based production house Mother London. “Similar segments have also been shot in Kenya and Minnesota in US. The trailer for the film was released online on February 26,” said   of ProTeam Films, a partner in the shoot for  .
 
 “It is great to see women riders in a country where people are still not used to the idea. During the shoot, in February, we came across people who found it strange to see a group of women riding motorbikes. That is the central theme of the short film — groups that developed despite the odds,” said Deshpande. The film was shot around Mumbai, Pune, Mulshi and featured 35 members of Bikerni’s Pune and Mumbai chapters.
 
 Sharing the challenges faced by the group, Patole said, “In the film, we speak about the discrimination and backlash many of our members faced on being seen and recognised as bikers. Sometimes the discrimination began right from their homes. Bikerni has become a platform for each member to share and face these problems together. We are now competing in riding contests and starting our own blogs, among various other activities driven by a common passion.”
 
 To present them in their natural element, the Bikerni members cruised while dressed in salwar-kameez for the film. Formed in 2011, the group currently has 1,100 members across 14 divisions around the country.
