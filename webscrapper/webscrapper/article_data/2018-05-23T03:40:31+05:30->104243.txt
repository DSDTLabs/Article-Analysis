New Delhi: Delhi chief minister Arvind   on Tuesday filed a plea in a city court, seeking seeking visuals and statement recorded by Delhi Police in connection with an alleged   on chief secretary   by two AAP MLAs on February 19.

 Acting on the plea of the CM, additional chief metropolitan magistrate Samar Vishal issued notice to Delhi Police and sought its reply. It also directed the investigating officer to appear in person on May 29, the next date fixed for hearing.
 
 In his application, moved through advocate B S Joon, Kejriwal said that after the proceedings on the day, the police made a statement before the media that CM evaded certain questions by not giving proper answers, which was “fully incorrect”.
 
 “The conduct of the police before the media gives an indication that the police can go to any extent to frame him or any other member of the AAP by tampering with the said statement/CD,” the application said, adding that he was entitled to get a copy of the statement and the CD.
 
 Delhi police had last week on Friday questioned Kejriwal and sought to know from him about the sequence of events on the fateful day.
 
 The CM’s lawyer told the court that last Friday, the Delhi Police had videographed the proceedings related to his recording of the statement and prepared a CD.
 
 Police sources had said some questions put to Kejriwal included the decision to convene the late night meeting with Prakash, the sequence of events that led to the assault and the trigger for the incident.
