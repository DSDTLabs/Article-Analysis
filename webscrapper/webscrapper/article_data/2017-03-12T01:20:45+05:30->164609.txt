MUMBAI: In separate cases, the   on Saturday arrested two flyers who flew into Mumbai from Dubai and Muscat on   that belonged to other Indians working there. Both accused — Victor Alan (30) from Kerala and Shafika Nisar (48) from Tamil Nadu — committed the crime as they have cheque-bouncing cases against them in the Gulf and cannot travel to India. 

 The police said Alan tried to dispose of the passport by flushing it in the toilet at the airport but immigration officials managed to retrieve it. Alan’s flight from Dubai landed in Mumbai at 3.20am and he was to catch a connecting flight to Kerala to reach his native plcae in Kollam, said the police. He had been running a manpower supply business in Dubai and was convicted in cheque-bouncing case in 2014. He committed similar crimes after being released from jail. “Alan used the passport of person who looks like him. After landing, Alan went to toilet, tore the passport and flushed it. Later, he walked up to the immigration counter for stamping and showed his original passport that had his entry in the country when he was caught,” said an officer.
 
 In the second case, Nisar, a housewife and resident of Thanjavur, used her photograph on a passport of another woman. She too has been punished in a cheque-bouncing case in Dubai. “She travelled from Dubai to Muscat via road and then took a flight,” said the officer. 
 
 “After reaching Mumbai, the duo showed their original passports,” said the investigators. The two will be produced before a holiday court on Sunday.
