Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa, on Thursday, directed the Goa government to take proactive steps to immediately conduct a survey of all   affected areas to find out which villages require water assistance. 

 Advocate general Dattaprasad Lawande told the court that the district mineral foundation committee members have already visited the villages of Pissurlem and Sonshi, and submitted their report to the court.
 
 Justice N M Jamadar, however, told the respondents that a survey of other mining affected areas is also necessary and expressed urgency due to paucity of time.
 
 Lawande in his reply said that the government has issued advertisements regarding benefits available to mining affected people under Rule 4 of the Goa District Mineral Foundation Rules, 2016, and has invited applications from mining affected persons.
 
 Director of mines Prasanna Acharya requested the director of panchayats to ensure that notices on the fund are put up in every panchayat for information to the general public following which the director of panchayats Ajit Panchwadkar sent a memo to all block development officers directing them to circulate the information to all village panchayats and give wide publicity.
 
 The high court in March had pulled up the government for collecting Rs 180 crore, but not utilising the money for the benefit of the needy where even drinking water was not provided in some cases. It added that the mining affected, in whose name hundreds of crores of rupees are collected by the foundations, cannot be made to toil for benefits which are rightfully theirs.
 
 The high court said that the foundation cannot be a passive spectator and must take a pro-active role to reach out to the needy. It added that no publicity was given to the fund and that wide publicity must be given to the fact that the fund is available.
