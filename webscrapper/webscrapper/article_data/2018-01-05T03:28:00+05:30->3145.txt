Visakhapatnam: The   service, which was launched amidst huge fanfare on December 29 during Visakha Utsav, came to a halt on Thursday due to tepid response from the public after the holiday season.

 As there were no customers, the chopper did not arrive at the Rushikonda helipad on Thursday. The chopper rides saw strong demand during the Visakha Utsav till New Year Day with the chopper making more than 20 sorties a day. According to a senior   official, the operations of the chopper on a particular day will be based on the demand from the public. “If there are no tourists, it may be rested till the festive season commences,” he said.
 
 Vuda has recently constructed a permanent helipad at Rushikinda to operate the chopper on a continuous basis as the existing helipad in Vuda Park falls in the air funnel zone. Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu formally launched the services from a temporary helipad at Vuda Park on December 16. Vuda has started offering the rides from its Rushikonda helipad from December 29, coinciding with the Visakha Utsav. According to observers, the ticket price of Rs 2,500 may be a dampener for the public to take the 10-minute ride on a regular day.
