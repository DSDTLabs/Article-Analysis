Greater Noida: A 45-year-old man was allegedly shot dead by his relatives over a property-related dispute in Mayana village of Greater Noida on Sunday.

 Manju, wife of victim Shashi Singh, alleged that he was beaten up by his father Sheeshpal Singh, his elder brother Jeetan Singh and nephews Sunder and Niranjan and later shot.
 
 Shashi’s first wife had expired long back and he remarried Manju. He has a son from his first marriage who has been staying with his grandparents in Mayana. Shashi worked in a factory and was staying in Faridabad for the past nine years.
 
 As per the complaint filed by Manju, her in-laws called Shashi to Mayana on Sunday morning, on the pretext that his son Akash was unwell. Manju said that Sheeshpal would sell parts of land but did not share the amount received from the buyer with Shashi, due to which they were not in good terms with each other. Sheeshpal’s will has also excluded Shashi though some parts of the land have been named for Akash.
 
 Police, however said that it has to examine Sheeshpal’s will and the land sale deed to confirm the veracity of the complaint. They have denied any external injuries on Shashi's body saying that there is only a bullet shot in his head.
 
 “All the four persons are absconding and we’re searching for them. An FIR has been lodged under Section 302 (murder) of IPC against Sheeshpal, Jeetan, Sunder and Niranjan,” Rajveer Chauhan, SHO, Rabupura police station told TOI.
