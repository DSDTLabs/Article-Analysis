BENGALURU: Former Union minister S M Krishna seems to be finding it difficult to get over his long attachment to the Congress - a fact he admitted before members of his new party, BJP, on Friday. He said: "It's difficult to get over a 46-year-old relationship suddenly." 

 Krishna, who was given a rousing welcome at the BJP office by state party chief B S Yeddyurappa and other functionaries, kept referring to them as "you". "I admire the discipline your party has," he said, prompting BJP MLC   to say: "It's not you anymore, it's we." Agreeing sheepishly, Krishna said, "It will take a while for me to get over it."
 
  Krishna chose the occasion to hit back at the Congress, particularly the party's leader in  ,  , who had reacted on his joining the BJP. Kharge had said: "Krishna has committed a mistake. The 84-year-old leader is bowing to a junior - BJP's national president Amit Shah." Krishna said, "Well, 77-year-old Kharge bows to 46-year-old AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi. Kharge should first see his own back before commenting on others." 
 
 He heaped praises on PM   and appreciated demonetization and the surgical strike. "When I was external affairs minister, Pakistan didn't understand India's language. Modi has given a befitting reply to Pakistan with the strike," Krishna said. 
 
  
 
 
  Likening himself to BJP candidate  , he said, "Both of us were sailing on the same boat. We faced mental torture in the Congress and our exits were humiliating. I have no aspirations for any post in the BJP and will do what Yeddyurappa expects from me. Polarization has been growing in Karnataka and it will be known in four t o five months which way it is headed."
