CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu higher education minister unveiled radical changes in the way the state will go about selecting vice-chancellors of universities, on Saturday.

 Minister KP Anbalagan said   had promulgated an ordinance on the composition of search committees for shortlisting vice Chancellor candidates, and qualification of the members of the search panels , after corruption charges emerge. The ordinance will be released by noon. 
 
 The plan to select three members goes like this : Chancellor/governor will select a SC/HC judge or eminent education is to be his nominee is the search panel; Tam Nadu government will select an eminent educationist/principal secretary or above ranking officer either serving or retired as its nominee; Senate/syndicate of the University will select eminent educationist director of institute of national importance or serving/retired vice chancellors/professors of ten years in any central and state universities. Notification of these search committees will be made six months before the vacancies arise. The panels should be in place in two months and names should be ready in four months. The day the post is vacant the name should be known. 
 
 The only issue will be for the University of Madras where the government will have to get the Presidential assent for making the changes to the Act.
 
 Now the Senates of Bharatidasan and   -- that have recommended names each -- will have to rework as per the ordinance, the minister said.
