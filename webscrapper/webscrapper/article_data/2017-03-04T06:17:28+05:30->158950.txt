BENGALURU: For employees in Bengaluru working in companies located far away from their dwellings, it's a constant and defeating exercise to beat the   to reach work on time. Whitefield is the worst place to commute to, said  . The report has studied 11 work hubs in Bengaluru and time taken and distance covered by employees to reach there. It said average time taken for one-way travel to Whitefield is 56 minutes to cover about 13km.

 The survey undertaken by   is part of a study that took into account 5 million shared rides in 15 cities across India in three years.
 
 According to the report, least time is taken to travel to   and Sarjapura -average 41 to 43 minutes for one-way travel. Average time and distance covered to reach Electronic City -the farthest from the city centre -are 49 minutes and 20km.

 MoveInSync's app targets firms where employees are provided transportation through a third-party  . Deepesh Agarwal, the startup's co-founder, said, “One has to enter employee code when one boards a cab and sign off when the trip ends. The app calculates the distance travelled and time taken to reach the destination. In most companies, employees share rides and calculating distance for each one of them is difficult. The app calculates the shortest distance travelled by an employee.“
 
 The work hubs surveyed in Benglauru included Whitefield, ORR Prestige Tech Park, ORR Manyata, ORR Doddanekkundi, ORR Bellandur, ORR Ecoworld, Bannerghatta, EGL Domlur, Electronic City and Yeshwantpur.
 
 Agarwal said data gathered through intelligent transport systems can provide effective solutions to handle the city's traffic chaos. “We cannot widen the roads, but we can definitely use technology to reduce the number of vehicles on roads,“ he added.
