CHENNAI:   police on Friday arrested a   and her daughter for allegedly forcibly admitting her son in a de-addiction centre so as to claim his share in the family property.

 The victim P Gnanasekaran, 37, of New Colony, Chromepet who managed to escape from the de-addiction centre lodged a complaint at Chennai police commissionerate. Based on this, police arrested his mother Visalakshi, 63 and elder sister Aarthi, 40. Aarthi is married and had been living with her mother at their house at New Colony, Chromepet.
 
 The family was planning to divide the property among the legal heirs and Aarathi reportedly tried to claim the lion’s share of it to which Gnanasekaran opposed. It led to a quarrel between Aarathi, Visalakshi and Ganasekaran. The duo then took Gnanasekaran to the de-addiction centre. “They told the de-addiction centre authorities Gnanasekaran was an alcoholic and there was no point in giving him a share in the property. They also decided to take away his share,” said an investigating officer.
 
 However, Gnanasekaran who managed to escape from the centre, lodged a complaint with the police commissioner’s office in   with the help of a friend. The complaint was forwarded to Chromepet police who arrested the mother-daughter duo. Gnanasekaran’s brother was mentally ill and was undergoing treatment at the same de-addiction centre, police sources said. 
 
 The women were later remanded in judicial custody.
