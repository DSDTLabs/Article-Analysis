BENGALURU: Air travellers bore the brunt of Thursday’s bandh as   suspended its Vayu Vajra services and KSRTC its Flybus services from   (KIA). Many passengers arrived at the airport several hours before their check-in counters opened to avoid risks of being delayed.

 A group of Israel tourists, who had planned to take the Flybus to Mysuru, had to wait for hours at the passenger bay. One of them,  , 35, told TOI: “Three of my friends and I want to travel to Mysuru. We had planned our schedule after reading up information online. We should have reached Mysuru by 11am, but the bus crew are saying they are waiting for senior officials to give the go ahead. The driver was good enough to allow us inside the bus so we could get some sleep.”
 
 Some passengers complained that cab drivers were charging exorbitant fares. “They are demanding Rs 2,000 to   and surrounding areas,”  , who had arrived from Chennai, said.
 
 
 
 
 Noted director Girish Kasaravalli, who flew down from Pune, was among those stranded at KIA. He eventually left in a cab.
 
 Hundreds of travelers were left at the mercy of auto and cab drivers at railway stations and the Majestic bus stand too.
 
 At Yeshwantpur station, auto drivers were seen telling travellers that cabs buses were on strike, and that they had no option but to travel in autos.
