BENGALURU: A fire, accidental or otherwise, is likely to cause 12 times more deaths than injuries as per the   data available in the country. The data shows 51 deaths are caused by fire every day as compared to four injuries.The data shows residential buildings are more likely to catch fire than factories manufacturing combustible items such as firecrackers and match-boxes. Incidents at residential buildings account for 29% of the total number of fires caused, while those at such factories account for just 1.42%.

 Overall, India lost 37,213 people to   in 2014 and 2015 — data for 2016 and 2017 are yet to be compiled — with most of them relating to those involving automobiles, including public service buses catching fire.
 Experts say residential buildings are more prone to fire due to non-adherence of fire safety norms and buildings constructed in violation of other building bye-laws. Schools and government offices have also reported cases of fire, but the numbers are few.
  
  
 While the number of cases in 2015 dipped by 9.4% to 18,450 from 20,377 in 2014, the number of deaths resulting from these incidents dipped by 9.2% — 17,700 from 19,513. This means that fewer fires claimed more lives in 2015.
 
 BK Hampagol, retired deputy director-technical, fire and emergency services, says: “There are multiple reasons for this. The most important is that most residential buildings do not have a fire exit. Also they do not adhere to the national building code, store items (diesel and kerosene for example) they are not supposed to and also have illegal structures.”
