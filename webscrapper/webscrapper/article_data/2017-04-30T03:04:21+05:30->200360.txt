GURUGRAM/MEWAT: Politicians have started making a beeline for  , 15km off Nuh in  , the village of   who died earlier this month after being   by  , along with four other Muslim dairy farmers.

 On Saturday, it was turn of Yogendra Yadav, the leader of Swaraj India. Yadav gifted Pehlu’s family a   and told them his party was consulting some Supreme Court lawyers and would approach the apex court directly if nothing concrete happened in the case soon.
 
 “There is no point in expecting from the state governments — both in Haryana and Rajasthan — to bring justice to Pehlu Khan. Miscreants are using the cow as an excuse to disrupt harmony. Cows are dying after eating polythene on roads, while Muslims in Mewat are rearing more than 30,000 cows,” Yadav said.
 
 Before Yadav, former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, youth Congress leader Mubarik Khan, Haryana AAP chief Naveen Jaihind, Haryana Congress chief Ashok Tanwar and INLD MLA Zakir Hussain have visited the village and sympathised with the family.
 
 However, no one from the ruling BJP or the state government has visited the family yet. “From the government side, not even a tehsildar has visited us. There has been no help of any kind from the state government,” Pehlu’s son Irshad told TOI.
 
 Irshad, who was also attacked by the cow vigilantes in Rajasthan’s Behror on April 1, along with his father and brother Arif, accused the Rajasthan Police of not taking any concrete action in the case. “It’s been a month that my father was lynched. The cops are treating it as a case of stay dog or cat dying on the road,” he said.
 
 However, the Rajasthan Police has so far arrested five persons in connection with the killing of 55-year-old Pehlu.
