MYSURU: Rejecting the   seeking three-day custody of an accused in a high-profile case, a city   on Tuesday questioned cops for releasing another accused after serving notice to him.

 Hearing arguments, the court asked police to produce the accused at 4pm on Thursday. 
 
 Mahadevaswamy, who was booked on the charges of cheating and forgery, had allegedly teamed up with   deputy director T S Subramanya to effect the transfer of ACP Mysuru Palace by levelling false allegations against him.
 
 DCP N Vishnuvardhana said they suspect that the accused Mahadevaswamy, at the behest of Subramanya, wrote a complaint in March end to election authorities alleging ACP V Sylendra of misusing his office to help Congress. But investigation revealed that it was a conspiracy by Subramanya and his team, of which Mahadevaswamy was a part, he stated.
 
 The III JMFC court judge hearing the bail petition of Mahadevaswamy questioned city police as to why Mahadevasamy was not released as they did to another accused, advocate Nagaraj representing Mahadevaswamy told TOI.
 
 Sources claimed that Subramanya was questioned from 7pm to 11.30pm on Tuesday before he was let off by Saraswathipuram cops.
 
 Vishnuvardhana said the investigation was underway and no fresh arrests were made in the case.
