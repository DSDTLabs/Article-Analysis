LUDHIANA: The ward delimitation process in Ludhiana has left residents of some wards confused, and even puzzled some of the candidates. The greatest confusion is in ward numbers 46 and 48, where both contestants from the same parties are erecting their hoardings and posters in some areas, without even knowing which ward the areas falls in. Some portions of   and Model Town localities have hoardings and posters of two candidates of different wards of the same party.

 The maximum confusion seems to be among Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) candidates   from Ward No.48 and Sukhwinder Singh Happy from Ward No.46, as their hoardings are being spotted in several areas alongside each other. LIP MLA Balwinder Bains said: “There seems to be confusion on the part of workers, who have been given the task of erecting hoardings and posters. Our candidates are well aware of the jurisdiction of their areas, and are campaigning in the localities of their own wards only. Moreover, this is a very petty issue being raised by opposing candidates.”
 
 However,   (SAD) too is not far behind when it comes to confusion regarding the jurisdiction of wards. The banners of SAD candidate Harbhajan Singh Dang from Ward No.46 and   from Ward No.48 can be seen alongside each other on Model House Road itself. Neither Dang nor Chabra could be contacted for their take on the issue.
 
 The issue is causing confusion among residents of the areas where hoardings of multiple candidates of the same party have been erected. Speaking to TOI, Model House resident   said: “Seeing the posters of candidates of both wards (46 and 48) has puzzled us, and now we are now going to consult MC officials on this to clear the confusion, because it will create problems for us on voting day, if we do not receive voting slips on time.”
