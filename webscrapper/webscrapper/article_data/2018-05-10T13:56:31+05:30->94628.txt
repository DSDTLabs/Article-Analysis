COIMBATORE:  , father of late Tiruchengode deputy superintendent of police R Vishnupriya, appeared before the chief judicial magistrate court here on Wednesday. He was summoned by the court after the   ( ) filed a report in April seeking closure of the case as the agency claimed that there was no evidence to prove official involvement in the DSP’s suicide.

 Vishnupriya had committed suicide in her official quarters on September 18, 2015. Work pressure was cited as the reason for the suicide. 
 
 Ravi told reporters that the case was adjourned to May 24. “The judge asked me if I had any objection to the report filed by the CBI and I said yes. We will file a petition on May 24,” he said.
 
 An emotional Ravi said that he had been visiting courts and offices for the past three years. “A proper investigation into the matter is required and we want the CBI to inquire with the superintendent of police, SR Senthil Kumar. We have not received their report yet. After we get their report, we will discuss and take further steps,” he said. 
 
 “Based on the conversations we had with her, we know that Vishnupriya was put under a lot of pressure over a period of time, which led her to take the extreme step,” he said and added that the CBI needs to investigate it further.
 
 CBI had submitted the report to close the case on April 16. On April 24, the court sent summons to Ravi asking him to appear before it. Vishnu Priya’s case was first probed by the state police and was later transferred to the state CB-CID. In July, 2016, the Madras high court transferred the case to CBI after Ravi sought a fair investigation.
 
 While the details of the report were not revealed, officials maintained that they could not find any evidence to prove that the suicide was a murder or there was any involvement of external persons in it.
