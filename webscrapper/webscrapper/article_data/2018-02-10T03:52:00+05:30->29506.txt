NEW DELHI: The   on Friday decided to transfer from the joint registrar to a court the ongoing cross-examination of finance minister   in a defamation suit filed by him against AAP chief   and five other party leaders. 

 Justice Manmohan said the cross examination of the Union finance minister will be done by a single judge of the high court. He further said the joint registrar's order directing Kejriwal to conclude Jaitley's cross-examination on February 12 becomes infructuous as now the court will decide the time frame and relevancy of questions put to the Union minister. 
 
 The court has fixed the matter for February 12 before Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw for recording evidence of Jaitley in the case. The finance minister has already been cross-examined on nine different occasions before the joint registrar. 
 
 The court agreed to delegate the cross-examination of the senior   leader to the single judge after the counsel for Jaitley and Kejriwal agreed to it. 
 
 The bench also observed that the proceedings be conducted in a time-bound and speedy manner. The court's direction came during the hearing of Kejriwal's appeal against the joint registrar's February 2 order directing him to conclude the cross-examination on February 12 itself. The joint registrar said that no further date shall be given to Kejriwal for further cross-examination of the Union minister. pti
