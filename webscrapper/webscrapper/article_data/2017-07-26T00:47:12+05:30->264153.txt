NEW DELHI: A   in   was   for assault on Tuesday after he thrashed a Class VI student for allegedly fighting with a friend in the classroom. 

 Police said that the child’s parents registered a complaint at the Nizamuddin police station after which he was taken for a medical test and a case was registered.
 
 The parents alleged that only their child was thrashed by the class teacher. The school could not be reached for comments despite repeated efforts.
 
 The child allegedly had a fight with another student. When the matter was reported to the teacher, he allegedly called the boy and thrashed him black and blue, police said.
 
 When the 13-year-old reached home, his parents were infuriated seeing the marks on his back and informed the police and the school authorities.
 
 “We have got the medical test done and the doctors described the injuries as simple and blunt, abrasions on the back. A case under Indian Penal Code Section 323 has been registered against the teacher,” said DCP south-east Romil Baaniya.
