MUMBAI: The Bombay   has held that a   is a  , and upheld a   that it be uploaded on the state police website. 

 An activist had applied under the   (RTI) for copies of the police manual in English and Marathi from the public information officer of the state director general of police's office. He also wanted true copies of the information regarding the proposal, dated July 26, 2006, submitted by the ATS assistant commissioner of police, along with investigation papers before additional DGP Sanjeev Dayal in a MCOCA case. The officer rejected his plea as did an appellate authority citing exemption under the RTI Act that bars giving information that could endanger an informant or expose his identity. In the second appeal, the chief information commissioner (CIC), however, directed that the manual be uploaded. 
 
 In March 2013, then CIC Ratnakar Gaikwad set at rest a debate over whether the police manual is confidential or otherwise. In a landmark order, Gaikwad held that within the meaning of the RTI Act, the police manual is not a confidential document and a copy of it should be provided to an applicant seeking its copy. The state immediately moved the HC to challenge the CIC. It said the manual is a ‘confidential document’. “The police manual cannot be equated with the information and therefore, there is no impediment in giving copies thereof to him,” said a bench of Justices Ranjit More and Sadhana Jadhav.
 
 The bench found no error in the CIC order and significantly said, “Judicial note can be taken of the fact that police manual is government publication and copies of same are easily available…Petitions are devoid of any merits.”
