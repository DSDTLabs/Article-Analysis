VASCO: Mormugao assembly constituency must be declared “sensitive”, pleaded Mormugao MLA and power minister  , in a letter written to the chief election commissioner, New Delhi.

 “There is need to deploy high security personnel as anti-social elements are inducing fear among law-abiding citizens, disturbing life in the constituency. Several cases of manhandling and assault are registered by Mormugao police”, Naik said, pointing out to areas such as   government high school, bus stops in the town and other places which are prone to anti-social elements. 
 
 Last week, Mormugao police arrested a local resident,  , alias Balan of Sada, under preventive measures. But, deputy collector of Mormugao Gourish Sankhwalkar released him on bail and a personal bond, and on condition that he presents himself at the Mormugao police station for the next two days. tnn
