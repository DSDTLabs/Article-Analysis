Ludhiana: A woman from Samrala has filed a complaint against member of parliament (MP) from Fatehgarh Sahib, Harinder Singh Khalsa for allegedly posting nude video in a WhatsApp group from his official number.

 In her complaint to deputy inspector general (DIG) of Ludhiana range Gursharan Singh Sandhu, the complainant Renu Sonia, a social worker said that she was member of a social group in which Khalsa posted a nude video on September 3.
 
 She claims that later when she called up Khalsa to raise objections he didn’t take her call and exited the group.
 
 The complainant says that either the MP should clarify or apologise for his actions.
 
 DIG Gursharan Singh Sandhu has confirmed that he has received a complaint against Khalsa and has asked SSP Khanna to probe the matter.
 
 “I have received the plaint today and have forwarded the same to SSP Khanna for investigation. He will verify the facts and take appropriate action," he said.
 
 When contacted, Khalsa denied posting the video but said that he would apologise.
 
 "My wife and I had gone overseas on August 24. My mobile which was left behind was used by my friend’s kids who might have posted the video. Still if it has offended someone, I am ready to apologise," he said.
