INDORE: Four children heading home from school were killed, along with their bus driver, when their schoolbus jumped the divider on the busy Indore Bypass and rammed a truck head-on on Friday afternoon. Eight children were injured, four of whom are in critical condition. 

  The impact was severe that the front of the bus looks like it had been blown apart in an explosion, and the truck - an 18-wheeler - was spun 360 degrees. Four children - Harmeet Kaur Kumar, Swastik Pandya, Kirti Agarwal and   - were killed on the spot. The bus driver, 26-year-old Rahul  , was nearly dismembered in the collision and his mangled body was stuck in the twisted and warped metal of the bus. The horrific accident sent shockwaves across the city. Thousands rushed to  , where the injured had been taken, to donate blood. 
 
 The authorities are yet to find out what led to the accident but witnesses have told police that the   bus was coming down the bridge at high speed when the driver lost control near   area around 3.30pm. It jumped over the two-ft-high divider and careened into oncoming traffic on the other side.
 
 It hit the truck so hard that some children were thrown out of the bus, say witnesses. The crumple inside of the bus shows the horror of the moment - schoolbags and bottles lay crushed under seats that had buckled and telescoped into one another.
 
  Passersby were the first to rescue the children. Policemen and volunteers were seen sobbing when retrieving bodies of little kids from the mangled wreckage. At Bombay Hospital, there were heart-rending scenes as families who had been awaiting the return of their children just minutes ago, arrived to take their bodies home. With emotions running high, police were deployed at the hospital and the school to prevent any flare-up. The injured children, includin g three girls, sustained multiple injuries, mostly to their head and limbs, a hospital spokesman said.
