NEW DELHI:  , connecting ITO   station to Kashmere Gate, is likely to open very soon.

 A two-day long safety inspection of the 5.17 kilometre long section by the Commissioner for Metro Railway Safety (CMRS) began on Monday. Following a go-ahead from the CMRS, the section will be opened to public.
 
 “We are yet to finalise a date for the opening. The decision will be taken after the inspection is over,” said a   (DMRC) official.
 
 The new section is an extension of the Violet line that connects Faridabad to ITO at present. Trial runs began on the ITO–Kashmere Gate section of Delhi Metro’s violet line on August 10, 2016.
 
 DMRC had earlier submitted the papers pertaining to the section to CMRS in March this year and had also submitted papers to the Independent Safety Assessor (ISA) for safety certification of the signalling systems.
 
 This entirely underground section comprises of four stations – Delhi Gate, Jama Masjid, Lal Quila and Kashmere Gate. The Kashmere Gate station will become the first ever interchange facility of the Delhi Metro system to provide inter-connectivity between three corridors of the network (Violet, Red and Yellow lines).
 
 This section will connect the areas of old Delhi such as Daryaganj, Delhi Gate and Red Fort with the business hub of Delhi at Janpath. The entire route length between Central Secretariat and Kashmere Gate is of 9.37 kms, with seven stations — Janpath, Mandi House, ITO, Delhi Gate, Jama Masjid, Lal Quila and Kashmere Gate. 
 
 The Janpath - Mandi House section was opened on June 26, 2014 and the Mandi House – ITO section was opened on June 8, 2015.
 
 The Heritage line was given clearance by NMA ( ) on February 13, 2013 and although the trial runs began in August last year, the project got delayed due to a multitude of problems, including shortage of labour and a ban on construction for some period.
