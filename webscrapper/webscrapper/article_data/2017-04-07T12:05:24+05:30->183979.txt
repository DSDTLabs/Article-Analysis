NEW DELHI: Thanks to their good behaviour, six inmates of   jail will be allowed to take up jobs outside of the prison premises. This is a first for the Delhi jail.

 The six inmates are serving life-sentences and are housed in the jail's semi-open jail section. They can seek employment anywhere within Delhi and will be allowed to work a 12-hour day, from 8 am to 8 pm. They will however need to report back to the prison at night.
 
 The six inmates are convicts in murder and other serious cases. They spent the first 12 years of their sentences in Tihar's jail no.2. Then, in view of their good conduct, they were moved to the semi-open section of the jail, where the rules are more relaxed, and where inmates stay in flats instead of prison cells.
 
 The committee reviewed the records of all 78 inmates in the semi-open jail before selecting the six they did. 
 
 Prison authorities will assist them in finding employment if the inmates are unable to find jobs by themselves.
