HYDERABAD: The official summer season might still be a month away, but residents of hi-tech Hyderabad are already feeling the heat, courtesy long hours of power outages. With the Telangana State Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (TSSPDCL) carrying out maintenance work along the western corridor, areas such as  , Kothuguda, Gachibowli are faced with regular disruptions in power supply - some of them lasting for six hours or more. 

 In fact, on Saturday, residents of Kondapur were left fuming as TSSPDCL snapped power supply in the belt for eight hours during the day.   and   were among the most affected pockets. "There was an eight hour outage on January 23 in Kondapur area citing 'maintenance work'. Again on Saturday, there was an eight hour outage for the same. What sort of maintenance work requires such repeated outages," questioned  , a resident of Kondapur. 
 
  
  
 
 While the power supply was restored in Kondapur by 5pm, it left residents high and dry. Officials attributed the power shutdown to maintenance work at   sub-station. "A feeder at the Kothaguda sub-station had developed technical snag due to which we had to get it replaced. We had snapped the supply at 10am. While the power supply in Whitefields was restored by 4pm, the same was restored in Sriram   by 5pm," said a   official from Kondapur. Residents rue that they have been experiencing such power cuts during weekends for the last two months. "You guys (TSSDPCL) really need to get this in control. Six out of the last 10 weekends there have had 'maintenance' power cuts, each of which lasts for about 7-10 hours," tweeted Ayan Jeloka.
