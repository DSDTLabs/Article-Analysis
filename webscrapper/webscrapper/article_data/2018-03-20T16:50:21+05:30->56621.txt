Shortage of firewood for gasifier units in the corporation’s crematoriums could push the local body to use LPG cylinders as an alternative to heat the furnace.

 The civic body operates 206 burial grounds and crematoriums. A few renovated facilities at Besant Nagar, Mylapore, Vyasarpadi and   use LPG cylinders to power gasifier units.
 
 
 The pinch was felt a few years ago when the government realised that the popular firewood   (Prosopis juliflora) was an invasive species and began removing the trees. “The stem of the plant has enough moisture that makes it a good firewood. These days, availability of Karuvelam is a problem because the government has been removing it,” said a burial ground assistant, requesting anonymity.
 
 At   off  , firewood is borrowed from the Isha Foundation-maintained Mylapore crematorium. “Since Mylapore uses LPG for the gasifier, we borrow their share of firewood,” said Iniyan, Krishnampet crematorium’s caretaker. The loaned wood covers no more than one cremation per day on occasions. “When we run out of firewood, we re-direct people to other crematoriums,” he added.
 
 At times, the shortage has resulted in ugly scenes. “We used to burn the bodies using whatever combustible material we could get our hands on,” said a corporation source about the old crematorium in Besant Nagar. This bitter truth came to light when relatives of a senior corporation official used the facility and discovered the issue, prompting authorities to privatise the crematorium.
 
 Switching to LPG is costeffective. “It is cheaper than electricity and better for the environment than firewood. We will review the requirement on a case-to-case basis since we don’t have a policy at present to use LPG gasifiers in all crematoriums,” said a senior corporation official.
