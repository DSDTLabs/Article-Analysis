CHENNAI:  , including  , who  , will soon have to pay in advance for the power they intend consuming. The department will remove   of regular defaulters and   instead.

 Prepaid meters work like prepaid Sim cards. “Based on their power consumption pattern, the discom will fix the monthly consumption of each government office.The department concerned will have to purchase prepaid meters from TNEB. Such meters have buzzers to alert consumers when their quota is exhausted. Unless they recharge the account, supply will not resume,“ said the official.
 
 Like mobile phones, one will be able to buy recharge vouchers for pre-paid power connections in Rs 500, Rs 200 and Rs 100 denominations. “Apart from ensuring timely payment, these meters will also help prevent power theft,“ said the official.The move is a fallout of many government departments defaulting payment of power bills despite reminders. “We are studying Telangana discom's prepaid meter system. Andhra Pradesh also has installed prepaid meters, mostly in government departments notorious for non-payment of bills.“
 
 Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board did not pay power bills for more than 6 months in 2016 and the figure was Rs 308 crore. Similarly , a few corporations did not pay power bills totalling `820 crore last financial year. “Despite repeated reminders, very few local bodies like Chennai Corporation paid up their bills. About `500 crore is yet to be collected from various local bodies,“ said the official.
