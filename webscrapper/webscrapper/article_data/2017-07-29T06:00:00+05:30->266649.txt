Visakhapatnam: In a huge disappointment to Andhra University (AU), governor ESL Narasimhan, who is also the university chancellor, will not attend the 83rd and 84th combined convocation to be held on Saturday. This is the fourth consecutive convocation ceremony that will be conducted without his presence. 

 Narasimhan assumed office as an acting governor in 2009 and in 2010 he was formally appointed as the governor. AU conducted four convocations after Narasimhan became the governor in 2009 — 77th convocation on May 15, 2010, 78th and 79th combined convocation on June 13, 2011, 80th and 81st combined convocation on February 10, 2014 and 82nd convocation on September 29, 2014. Other than attending the 77th convocation alongside former scientific advisor to the defence ministry VK Saraswat in 2010, Narasimhan skipped the ensuing three convocations. 
 
  AU officials have received a communiqué from Raj Bhavan that he will not attend the convocation. The AU vice-chancellor has been asked to carry out all proceedings on Narasimhan’s behalf.
 
 “He was known as an efficient bureaucrat and governed the two Telugu states when they were hotbeds of separate Telangana and United Andhra movements. But why he has been constantly neglecting Andhra University?” An AU researcher commented..
 
 When contacted by TOI, Raj Bhavan clarified that Narasimhan is pre-engaged with several events on the same day. “The same was intimated to the AU VC,” they added.
