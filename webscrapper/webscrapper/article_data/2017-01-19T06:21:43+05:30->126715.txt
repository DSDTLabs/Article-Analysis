NEW DELHI:   could drop up to five sitting MLAs in Rae Bareli and Amethi to create the right optics for Congress for an alliance in Uttar Pradesh.

 A final picture on seat-sharing failed to emerge on Wednesday, with all eyes on the two-day time-frame - as announced by Congress, and UP chief minister   - ending on Thursday .
 
 Amid negotiations, Congress is expecting to have its way in ensuring that the traditional Gandhi family fief continues to don the party colours. The tricky bit has been that Rae Bareli and Amethi account for a meagre Congress presence in the assembly owing to its poor performance in 2012. For Congress, it is difficult to have an alliance in which it does not contest the majority of seats in the constituencies represented by party chief   and heir apparent  .
