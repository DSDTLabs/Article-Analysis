GUWAHATI: Most people find ATMs which are out of order irksome and annoying. For a   in the city, though, the sight is a welcome one. 

 When city police busted an   recently, it revealed the massive nexus of cyber-criminals operating here who forge people's ATM cards and withdraw money from their accounts or use their cards for shopping at various places.
 
 "The criminals usually wait outside ATMs that are out of order for link failure or for cash to be exhausted. As unaware people enter such booths and are unable to withdraw money, a gang member enters the booth under the pretext of helping and cleverly swipes the targeted person's ATM card on their card reader, stealing the data from the card," a crime branch official explained. Subsequently, the racket prepares a clone debit card with hi-tech machines to be used for withdrawing money and making purchases.
 
 City police have recently nabbed three persons - Shariful Islam alias Shamim, Jiaur and Saddam - all from Howly in Barpeta district, who were running a similar racket here. Police have also recovered a portable card reader, one writer (machine used to transfer data onto blank magnetic strips on cards), and 25 magnetic strip cards which they had cloned.
