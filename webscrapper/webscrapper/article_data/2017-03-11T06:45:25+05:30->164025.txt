CHENNAI: The need to clear   was stressed by a judge of the   on Friday when he made it clear that he was upset with the utter   to dispose of old cases. 

 Justice S Vaidyanathan, noting that from next week onwards he expected better cooperation from lawyers, said he would start imposing costs on lawyers who either absented themselves or sought unnecessary adjournments.
 
 The judge, who is handling second appeal cases filed from the year 2011 to 2014 on civil side, said from next week onwards the advocates, and not litigants, would be made to pay costs. Partition suits, money suits and specific performance applications need not be kept pending needlessly, the judge told advocates, law officers and litigants in his court hall.
 
 He also appreciated the government lawyer for coming forward and submitting a list of 25 land acquisition cases which are ready for final arguments. He said all lawyers must furnish the list of cases where both sides are ready for arguments.
 
 In his 46-day stint at the Madurai bench of the high court till last week, Justice Vaidyanathan had disposed of 2,700 cases, including 1,800 writ petitions, said a court officer in Madurai. "He used to start court work at 9.15am at least twice a week and many advocates availed themselves of the benefit," he said. He also had a practice of asking lawyers coming with new cases to bring old pending cases filed by the same law offices or lawyers. "It really worked," said the law officer, adding linking new cases with old cases would balance the disposal of cases.
