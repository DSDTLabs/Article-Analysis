Palanpur: A Vadodara-based share broker lodged a complaint against four persons who allegedly beat him up and robbed him of Rs 6 crore near Idar. 

 Though the incident happened on September 9, Virendra Shah lodged a complaint with Idar police only late night on Monday. Shah named Haresh Vankar, Bhavesh Desai, Vikram Desai and Bhavji Goswami in the complaint. He told police four persons offered him Rs 30 crore in demonetized notes in lieu of Rs 6 crore as loan. They also promised to pay him interest. 
 
 “It was decided that the cash would be given to them at Vakdol village near Idar. When Shah reached there with his friend Shetal Shah, three of the four reached there and told them that Bhavesh was coming with Rs 30 crore. They asked him to hand over Rs 6 crore loan. But as soon as he gave the money, they thrashed him and his friend Shetal brutally and escaped with money,” said S B Chowdhary, inspector, Idar police station.
