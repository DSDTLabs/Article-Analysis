HYDERABAD: In the three years since   Mission was launched, only three districts — Jagtial, Rajannna Sircilla and   — have been declared Open Defecation Free (ODF) in Telangana. Now, officials are racing against time to give all villages   status by October 2, 2018. This would involve the massive task of constructing 19.70 lakh individual   in the next 12 months.

 This was estimated by officials of the panchayat raj and rural development department on   on Monday. Though the Centre had set Oct 2, 2019 as the deadline for all the states to declare themselves ODF, Telangana has advanced this by a year. As of now, there are 24.44 lakh toilets in rural Telangana, but the number needs to reach 44.14 lakh to make the districts OD free.
 
 Enquiries revealed that construction of toilets in many villages has slowed down due to delay in release of funds from the Centre. In some cases, families did not come forward to avail the scheme. Now, the state government has taken up the programme with funds from the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) as well as under the Swachch Bharat Mission.
 
 The Centre has also issued guidelines to the states stating that construction of toilets alone is not enough, officials have to chalk out strategies to launch massive awareness campaigns to tell people about the ill-effects of open defecation and importance of having individual toilets.
 
 The Centre has also directed state governments to plant saplings at the places where open defecation used to take place. Also, students in schools should be taught to wash their hands before having their midday meals. Officials have been told to devise programmes to bring about a change in the attitude of people regarding open defecation.
