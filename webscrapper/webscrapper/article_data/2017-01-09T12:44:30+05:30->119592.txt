THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   on a packed product may not be original, but could well be a fake one pasted over the actual price, is what the   of   learnt during a series of inspections at shops at the   in the city. LMD has registered cases under packaged commodities rules against the shop owners who were found to have tampered with the original price labels.

 “They either used fake price stickers on packaged food materials, which did not have an MRP (maximum retail price) or altered the label and fixed new ones denoting higher prices than the original ones. For instance the actual price of a food packet will be Rs 10, but a fake label will show the price as Rs 40,” said S  , assistant controller, LMD.
 
 The LMD inspectors usually look for the name of the manufacturer, the product name, the quantity, date of packing, maximum retail price and address for filing consumer complaints, on the package. Cases were also registered against shops where articles were being sold without displaying mandatory information. Mostly the cases were registered on charges of incomplete declaration regarding basic information of packaged commodity, the official said.
 
 Cases were also registered against a few hotels functioning at Varkala cliff mainly on charges of selling bottled water at a higher price than the MRP. Raids were also conducted at Pangode fish market after the squad received complaints on illegal use of weighing machines. During the raid it was found that some of the merchants used weighing machines which were not calibrated as per the norms.
