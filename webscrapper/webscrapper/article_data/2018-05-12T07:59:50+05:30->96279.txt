NEW DELHI: India and Nepal have agreed to ply buses on eight new routes to improve connectivity between the two neighbours. These include Patna-Janakpur, Kathmandu-Varanasi, Bodh Gaya-Kathmandu and Nepalganj-Delhi.

 
 Sources said the  , which PM   and his Nepalese counterpart   flagged off on Friday, was one of the routes that both Nepal and India governments had recently agreed. The regular service will start soon.
 
  
  
 "The routes were decided based on demands to connect different parts of Nepal with Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. One of the routes - Siliguri to Kathmandu - has also been approved by both sides. Currently, direct buses ply on four routes. Three buses ply from Delhi to Kathmandu, Pokhra and Mahendranagar while the fourth operates between Varanasi and Kathmandu," said an official.
 
 The official said there are demands for opening more routes, which will come up for consideration. He said state transport corporations are working to identify the operators and modalities to start bus service on the new routes.
 
 TOI has learnt that India has also taken up the issue of granting permission at Indo-Nepal border for Indian visitors to drive their vehicles during trips to the Himalayan nation. At present, permissions are granted by the Nepalese embassy, specifying the distance Indian tourists can go to in their own vehicles inside Nepal. There have been reports of Indian vehicles getting seized for violating the restrictions.
