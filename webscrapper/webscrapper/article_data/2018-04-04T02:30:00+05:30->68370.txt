Golugonda: Six persons were   when a fight broke out between people of two villages at Tandava reservoir in Golugonda mandal in the district late on Monday night. The villagers hurled stones at each other following a dispute over fishing rights in the reservoir, which is famous for its prawn catch. 

 Villagers of Salika Mallavaram in Golugonda mandal and Jalaripeta on the outskirts of Adakula village in Koyyuru mandal even fought with sticks following the stone-pelting. Four people from Salika Mallavaram have been seriously injured in the fight. Of the four, Jonna Rambabu and Jonna Lal received head injuries and have been shifted to King George Hospital (KGH) in Visakhapatnam, while the other two have been admitted in a hospital at Narsipatnam. Two people from Adakula village also received minor injuries.
 
 According to sources, the dispute started when some people from Adakula were fishing in Tandava reservoir, which is very close to Salika Mallavaram village. On coming to know about their actiivities, the villagers of Salika Mallavaram asked them to vacate the place and warned them not to fish there again. But Adakula people refused to listen and soon a fight ensued, leading to stone-pelting.
 
 Many families living within a radius of five kilometres from Tandava depend on fish catch from the reservoir to make a living. A society has also been formed to demarcate the boundaries and deal with other issues relating to fishing.
