 Hiphop Tamizha

 The album starts with the much-hyped  . Sung by Vijaya T Rajendar, Hip Hop Tamizha and  , this one’s a folk-meets-techno number. TR brings in a local flavour to the song, while Adhi adds some swag with his rendition. Oxygen by Hip Hop Tamizha and Sudharshan Ashok is a likeable melody. The tune is catchy and the interludes are so beautiful. Mathurangalam by Kaber Vasuki has a jazzy feel. The lyrics, cleverly penned by Kabilan, make for a nice listen. Sounding more like a montage number, this one is an offbeat number that’s seldom heard from this duo. 
 
 Mahakavi Bharathiyar’s Theeratha Vilayattu Pillai gets a classical-techno mix. Rendered by Hip Hop Tamizha, Anthony Dasan, Padmalatha and Georgina Mathew, the song starts off on a western note, what with effective electric guitars portions. It slowly moves to classical with Padmalatha rendering it well, slipping into techno, and eventually ending on a folk note. If you don’t mind giving the classic a modern twist, then this one makes for nice listen. The album ends with Boomerang, which, again, has Hip Hop Tamizha rendering the song, along with Velmurugan, Kaushik Krish and Nikita Gandhi. It sounds like a typical Hip Hop Tamizha song, and sounds more like a stylish, situational number that would work on the big screen. A passable listen. With   moving away from Harris Jayaraj, the album has songs that have the feel of the songs of his films, albeit with a twist.
