BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh police have issued a high alert in Balaghat and Mandla district following fresh inputs on Maoist movement in the region. “They are moving between Kavardha and   area in Balaghat along Mandla district,” said Amit Sanghi, SP Balaghat.

 The Communist Party of India (Maoists) has recently carved out a new zone for its operations — Gadchiroli–Rajnandgaon-Balaghat (GRB), straddling the border tri-junction of Maharashtra,   and Madhya Pradesh.
 
 Security forces in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh have already intensified operations.
 
 The old North Gadchiroli-Gondia-Balaghat and Rajnandgaon (NGGBR) division has now been converted into GRB zone/division, and Maoists and are already surveying and recruiting in this region, said police sources. This will drive security agencies back to the drawing board to realign forces according to the new set-up.
 
 Balaghat, Rajnandgaon, Gondia and Gadchiroli come under a division of   of CPI (Maoists). Officials engaged in anti-Maoist operations say the new GRB division is headed by Surendra, Dama and Santosh.
 
 This information was revealed by 19-year-old Waman Mandavi, a member of the cultural wing of CPI(Maoist), who was arrested from Gondia district of Maharashtra in April.
