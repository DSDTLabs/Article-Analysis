ALAPPUZHA: The BJP cannot grow in Kerala and they are not going to improve on their current position in the state, said Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam general secretary  . 

 "The state leadership of the BJP is backing only the forward communities. So, they will not get any support from Christians, Muslims and Hindu backward communities. Besides, they will not get all the forward community votes because the majority of them are supporters of the Communist and the Congress parties," said Natesan. But he agreed that the Tripura election results had given a new energy and confidence to the workers of the BJP in the state.
 
 When asked about the Yogam's stand in   bypoll, he said that they had not finalized their stance. "We will hold a meeting after the declaration of the election date and announce our stand," said Natesan.
 
 He added that the stand of Yogam will not be that of the BDJS. "BDJS is a political party and they will have their own stand. Yogam is not a political party but we a political stance. So our vote will be for the party that ensures social justice," he said.
 
 Talking about the candidates for the byelection, he said that the Congress had selected a candidate, who was not popular in the constituency. "However, LDF candidate   and BJP candidate P S   are my good friends. When Saji Cherian supports the activities of SNDP Yogam, Pillai, as an advocate, had helped when some people tried to trap me for their personal gains," said Natesan.
 
 When asked about the LDF government's rule in the state, he said that Yogam was not fully completely satisfied. "They are going away from the backward communities. Their decision for ensuring reservation for forward communities in devaswom boards is an example. If they are ready to correct their stand towards backward communities, the LDF government will again come into power in the state," he said.
