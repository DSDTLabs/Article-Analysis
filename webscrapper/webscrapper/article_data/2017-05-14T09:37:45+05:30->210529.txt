PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Pimpri police have registered an offence against eight BJP workers for allegedly creating a ruckus and burning effigies of party leaders in front of party’s Pimpri office on Saturday. They were protesting against the nomination of co-opted corporators in the PCMC.

 The discontent within the party came to the fore when   workers and other workers burnt effigies of Rajya Sabha MP   and Sachin Patwardhan, chief of public accounts committee.
 
 A case has been filed against Nilesh Ashtekar and seven other workers under provisions of the Mumbai Police Act. The workers were annoyed over the selection of   and Babu Nair for the posts.
 
 Ashtekar, vice-president,   unit of BJYM, said, “We have objections to the selection of Thorat and Nair. Both were involved in anti-party activities during the civic polls. Sable and Patwardhan had suggested their names so we burnt their effigies.”
 
 Sable, when contacted, said, “The incident is an attack on BJP’s leadership, ideology, culture and organizational working and it is condemnable.”
