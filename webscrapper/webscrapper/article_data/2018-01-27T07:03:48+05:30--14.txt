HYDERABAD: Coming down heavily on the   government, TRS MP B   on Friday shot a letter to Prime Minister   asking him to make the process of giving the prestigious   awards more inclusive, duly recognising persons from all regions.

 Demanding more equitable reward to contributions of individuals from across the country, he expressed concern over   state not getting even a single award.
 
 
 “Historically, the ministry of home affairs selects names amongst nominees behind closed doors without any transparency. However, by way of multiple RTIs filed over the years, the government finally decided in 2011 to release the selection criteria, process and other details on an online portal. Transparency is always welcome and I laud the efforts of the government to help the general public understand the norms and rules behind these prestigious awards,” said Vinod.
 
 He said he was saddened to see that not a single awardee was from Telangana — though the state government recommended multiple names, especially from the literary field — for the Padma awards. “I understand the discretion of the Padma Awards committee but the people nominated by the state government of Telangana are well known for their lifetime achievements and special service,” he said.
 
 The TRS government is upset with the raw deal meted out in terms of Padma awards. It has been decided to take the matter to the logical end by raising a voice of protest. Other MPs are also learnt to have been directed to express their displeasure with the NDA government in coming days, said sources.
