NEW DELHI: Even though the Delhi   president Ajay Maken held a meeting with CM Arvind Kejriwal over sealing, Congress president   on Tuesday attacked both AAP and BJP over the issue. 

 Taking to twitter, Gandhi advised both BJP and Congress to “stop the drama of allegations and counter-allegations over sealing in city.” His tweet said, “Due to the fake fights and the collusion between BJP and AAP, traders are facing a lot of damage.” He also suggested that both the parties should work together to   a solution.
 
 Gandhi’s tweet has come a couple of days after Kejriwal wrote a letter to him seeking help in insisting the Centre to introduce a Bill in the Parliament to usher changes in the law to stop the drives. Kejriwal wrote that the issue needs to be strongly raised in the Parliament. 
 
 The AAP functionaries have claimed that after the all-party meeting, Congress has agreed to support AAP on the issue in the Parliament. However, replying to Gandhi’s tweet, Kejriwal again urged him to raise the issue in the Parliament and offered all support from AAP.
