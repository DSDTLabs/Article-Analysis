Indore: Panic spread in Banganga area after the bodies of a woman and her two children were found in their house on Monday morning.

 Suman Bai, 30, and two children Abhishek, 12 and Vanshika, 7, were found lying on the floor with injuries all over their body and covered in dried blood.
 
 Suman Bai and children lived in a small house in Bhawani Nagar with a 35-year-old driver Yeshwant. The man had met the woman some time ago on a trip and brought her along with her children to Indore.
 
 On Monday, locals in Bhawani Nagar were in a state of shock after they got to know about the triple murder in their locality. Hundreds of people including children had gathered around the house to take a glimpse of the accused and the women and children who were beaten to death by Yeshwant.
 
 Locals and neighbours didn’t have a clue that something of this sort was going on in a house in their locality.
 
 “We did not hear any screaming or any type of sound in the night. I woke up several times in the night but did not hear any sound from the neighbourhood,” said an elderly woman – neighbour of Suman Bai.
 
 One of the residents claimed that late night a marriage procession passed through the locality. “That must be the time when he killed them,” said Kalu.
 
 Locals claimed that though the man was in love with Suman Bai, it was costing him too much to take care of the two children and the couple used to fight often on this topic.
 
 While giving statement to the police, father of the accused, Kailash, claimed that Yeshwant had brought the woman and children home some time ago and was planning to keep them in the house without marrying her.
 
 Angered by this, Kailash had moved out and was living with his family in Shiv Nagar.
