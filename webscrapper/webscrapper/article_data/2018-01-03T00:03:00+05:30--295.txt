NEW DELHI : Fine quality   (grade A) worth   in the international market was seized from two Punjab-based traffickers during an operation carried out by special cell of Delhi Police. 

 The peddlers identified as Ravi Shankar (50) and Vikas (30) were arrested and the 3.5kg drugs seized from them. Police said the narcotic was so fine that it could have been adulterated to double the quantity. 
 
 DCP (special cell) Pramod Kushwaha said Shankar was earlier convicted in two drug trafficking cases and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was released in 2015 and returned to the trade. He is estimated to have supplied drugs worth around Rs 200 crore. 
 
 ACP Attar Singh’s team had received a tip-off about a group of traffickers active in UP, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. “Inspectors Arvind and Dinesh were asked to work on the leads and develop clues about the cartel. Concrete intelligence was gathered after investigation lasting four months. Last week, an informer tipped us off about the duo having received the consignment of heroin from a person of African origin,” Kushwaha said. 
 
 Finally, a trap was laid near Sherawala gurdwara on Ring Road in west Delhi and the men were arrested. A team was subsequently sent to Punjab and more heroin was seized from Shankar’s house there. 
 
 The accused are part of an international cartel being run from Afghanistan. Apart from Indians, Afghans, Pakistanis and people from African countries are part of this syndicate.
 
 The duo disclosed that their suppliers were Nigerians living in New Mahavir Nagar, who procured it from contacts in Afghanistan. Carriers would ingest the drug capsules and come from Afghanistan to hand it over to the Nigerians. 
 
 Consignments were also sent to other countries in Europe and Africa. “The supplier in this case was introduced to Shankar by a Nigerian woman lodged in Kapurthala jail with him,” Kushwaha added. Shankar used to sell drugs in jail as well and was rearrested in jail for it, police said.
