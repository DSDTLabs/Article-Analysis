SURAT: Chief commissioner of income tax (CCIT)   has urged diamond company owners in the world’s biggest diamond cutting and polishing centre in the city to maximize their tax filing from Surat instead of Mumbai and also deduct TDS from diamond workers’ wages, gift and bonus too. 

 Senior officers from Surat income tax commissionerate led by CCIT Ajai Das Mehrotra and principal commissioner of income tax (Surat 1&3) Rajeev Nabar had organized a meeting with diamond industry leaders at   (SDA) office here on Thursday. 
 
 The I-T authorities appealed to the diamantaires to deduct TDS on Diwali bonus or gifts given to diamond workers and other staff members. 
 
 The diamond industry leaders, including chairman of Venus Jewels Sevanti Shah and Lalji Patel of Dharmanandan Diamonds welcomed the suggestion given by I-T authorities and promised them all the support from the industry. 
 
 Those present in the meeting said the aim of the I-T authorities was to bring home the point that diamond company owners should pay their I-T in Surat instead of Mumbai. Most of the diamond companies have their head offices in Mumbai and have been filing I-T returns there, thereby increasing tax income of Maharashtra government. 
 
 Diamond industry leader Kirti Shah told TOI, “We totally agree with the I-T authorities that when the diamond processing industry is located in Surat, why pay tax in Mumbai? If we start paying tax in Surat, then government allocation to the city will increase manifold.”
 
 The I-T authorities said when it comes to total tax collection in south  , diamond industry has less than four per cent contribution. 
 
 Industry leaders were of the opinion that many diamond company owners will be shifting their offices to the world-class   (SDB), which is under construction. Once the offices shift to the SDB, the diamond company owners will certainly file their tax returns in Surat.
