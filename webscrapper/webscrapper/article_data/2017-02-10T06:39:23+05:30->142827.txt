PUNE: Minimum temperatures in central Maharashtra and Marathwada may rise further in the next two to three days, India   (IMD) officials told TOI on Thursday. 

 Weather forecasters said that temperatures in many parts of Vidarbha, Marathwada and central Maharashtra have scaled up significantly. The mercury-level across most of these regions has been settling between the 33 C and 35 C mark. 
 
 A senior IMD official told TOI that the minimum temperature in Marathwada and central Maharashtra may rise by a degree or two in the next two to three days due to an absence of an active western disturbance in northwest India. "Cold, dry northerly and northwesterly winds tend to flow in Maharashtra after an active western disturbance passes. However, the current western disturbance is not strong enough to influence the flow of northerly winds into central Maharashtra and Marathwada. Temperatures here may therefore not fall below the current levels for the next four days to a week," the official said. 
 
 On Thursday, Pune, Lohegaon and Malegaon were among the stations that recorded the highest minimum temperature departures. The city's minimum temperature was 3.6 C above normal, at 15 C, while Lohegaon's minimum temperature touched a warm 17 C, around 4 C above normal. 
 
 Sources from Skymet Weather Services said that a cyclonic circulation and a trough are expected to form over   on February 11 evening. This may cause warm and humid southerly and southeasterly winds to continue prevailing over the region for another three to four days. 
 
 The minimum temperature may thus increase further. Nights may therefore become comparatively warmer, lessening the cold weather conditions prevailing every now and then during the wee hours of the day and at night.
