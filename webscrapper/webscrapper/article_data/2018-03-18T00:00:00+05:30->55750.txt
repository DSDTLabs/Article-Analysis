Director/producer   shares his style mantra with us:

 
  A tight white tee-shirt.
 
 A black suit.
 
  I like what Sonam Kapoor wears because she’s fashion forward. I also appreciate Kangana Ranaut’s edgy style.
 
  Everything outrageous about fashion I hear or receive is from Ranveer Singh.
 
  You can’t call it stylish but the most beautiful films in terms of the costumes were Pakeezah and Mughal-E-Azam. They’re not stylish but they’re iconic in terms of costume design. Also, one film that started the trend of casual dressing on screen is Dil Chahta Hai.
 
  I only give fashion advice to  , Varun Dhawan and   because I have a right to. Otherwise, I keep my opinion to myself.
 
  I don’t repeat my clothes very often. So there’s nothing old in my wardrobe.
 
  A bit exhausting. There is a lot of pressure, it’s annoying. Especially when you can’t repeat your stuff as it has already made it to the fashion pages. 
 
  (Laughs) According to weight… That’s three words!
 
  Ask me no secrets, I’ll tell you no lies.
 
  They do but they choose not to avail of them because they believe being fashionable is feminine or effeminate, which is wrong.
 
 
  
 
 
  I’d love to see Rekhaji’s wardrobe.
 
  Ae Dil Hai Mushkil
 
  Patches are my new thing. Patches on bags, patches on jackets. Denim jackets, denim on denim... 
 
  Manish Malhotra.
 
 Mr   for his ability to carry off anything and his flamboyance.
