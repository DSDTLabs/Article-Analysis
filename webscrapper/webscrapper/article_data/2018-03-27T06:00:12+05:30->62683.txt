KOLKATA: The   police have written to the   (MCI) to ascertain if the doctors - along with three RMOs - working at Annapurna Nur- sing Home possess valid medical degrees. 

 The cops said they have also asked the health department to help them investigate if another nursing home at   has the license to issue certificates to "ICU trained operators". 
 
 "We need to nab one more person - Vicky - the ambulance owner who played a major role in arranging the trip from Burdwan to Kolkata for Madhyamik examinee Arijit Das. But we also need to ascertain the background of doctors who assured the victims' family that their son was in safe hands," said an officer.
 
 Police sources said that all the five accused questioned so far claimed they knew each of the doctors well and that they were paid hefty commissions to bring patients to these specific doctors at the nursing home. "The accused have tried to shift a part of the blame on the doctors. We will need to record their statements and ascertain if any of these allegations are true," the officer added.
