Ahmedabad: The Metro construction in the walled city will hit a roadblock on the crucial Kalupur leg, if merchants of the wholesale Revdi Bazaar or Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sindhi Co-operative Society (SVPSCS) fail to part with land for the project. The market complex officially has 455 shops and an additional 68-odd illegal extensions, which are contesting the takeover of their market for the metro project. 

 The merchants say that nearly 5,000 square metres of their total of 10,000 square metres of land will go into the project and road deduction.
 
 The society demanded 10,000 square metres at an open mill land nearby, to relocate the 60-year-old market. President of SVPSCS Ram Chawla says, “The deduction for the metro and the TP road will eat away more than half of our market area . The land was alloted to the society by the Union government for Sindhi settlers after Partition. Most of us are in the wholesale business for decades and we will lose our clientele and livelihoods.”
 
 The Revdi Bazaar traders association has sent four reminders to the AMC about the issue. A senior AMC official clarified that there illegal shops had mushroomed within the Revdi Bazaar premises and that the association were to pull these illegal structures down. The merchants argued that in early 2000, merchants had paid Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Rs 1.25 crore at the rate of Rs 7,500 per square metre for the market place. “The society has receipts to show we have paid Rs 1.25 crore to the AMC. The civic body is yet to complete the formalities. We have been paying rent of Rs 100 and Rs 50 to the AMC,” says president of the society Ram Chawla. On Monday, Naroda MLA Balram Thawani led a delegation of 50 Sindhi community members including those from Revdi Bazaar to meet chief minister Vijay Rupani.
