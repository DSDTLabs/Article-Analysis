 A team of police officials, comprising those attached to  , conducted an awareness meeting at   atop Kolli Hills. 
 
 Led by additional superintendent of police (ADSP) S  , the team told the tribal villagers not to possess guns, including country-made guns, illegally.
 
 “I also explained them the need to obtain proper permission from the concerned authorities to possess a gun,” Senthil told TOI. He also assured the villagers that he would not initiate any action against them if they were to handover the guns voluntarily to the police. After the meeting, he gave them time to surrender the illegal guns.
 
 In a few hours, the villagers kept 10 rifles on a temple premises. When alerted, the ADSP rushed to the spot and recovered them. He also directed the Senthamangalam police to register a case under Section 102 of CrPC (power of police officer to seize certain property). 
 
 “The guns will be kept at district armed reserve lockers,” Senthil said.
