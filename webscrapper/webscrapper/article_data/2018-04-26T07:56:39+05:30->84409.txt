JAIPUR:   is fast becoming history in Rajasthan. The number of students appearing in job oriented   (SS) course (equal to BEd degree) is almost half of the total number of seats available. This year 4444 candidates are appearing in the entrance exam against 7810 seats on April 29. The poor response is gradually sealing the fate of the ancient language in the state and will create a scarcity of Sanskrit teachers. The SS course is mandatory for teaching Sanskrit in government schools and colleges. A degree in SS is also preferred by private institutions.

 The Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Rajasthan Sanskrit University is forced to conduct entrance test for the SS course on April 29. The university administration has shot a letter to the Sanskrit education department seeking cancellation of the exam due to fewer number candidates. 
 
 “It’s illogical to conduct the exam. It has been explained to the department that all those appearing in the exam will certainly get the seat. The department has directed us to conduct the exam which is a waste of resources,” said a university source.
 
 Avdesh Akodia, who follows developments in the Sanskrit education, has blamed consecutive governments for reducing the ancient religious language as an untouchable subject. 
 
 "It is heartening to see that state which was part of ancient Indian civilization. Sanskrit, which once flourished in this region, is now facing a bleak future,” said Akodia. 
 
 The disinterest for Sanskrit is not restricted to SS. The lone Sanskrit university has recorded all time low enrolments in 2017-18. 
 
 Figures say that university has enrolled 95 candidates for the session 2017-18 against 560 seats available and is struggling to stand on its feet. Not a single student has taken admission in   at   (UG) and   (PG).
