Actor   has earned praise from critics as well as the audiences for his turn as Somdev in the recently-released 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania'. While it might not have been the lead role, he has managed to grab eyeballs.In fact, he had also featured in the first installment of the successful franchise, ' ', as the lead actor’s ( ) friend. Though he has persevered for 11 years in Mumbai to hone his acting skills and make it big in the industry, Sahil is not scared of being typecast as a character actor. He says, “I used to have apprehensions earlier. However, I was confident about my training in theatre. People used to tell me that I am going to become a comedian or a character actor. Now that I know the industry well, I hate these categorisations. I dare them to try and stereotype me. After 'Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania', I was offered the same kind of roles, but I didn’t become greedy for money and accept them. They can’t decide my role for me. When I was three years old, I wanted to be Aamir Khan, why let go of that dream when I am 30?”

 The actor, who spent his formative years in Delhi, had done close to 40 theatre productions by the time he had finished his graduation. While Sahil aspires to scale greater heights with each new film, does nepotism in the industry prevent outsiders like him from achieving their dreams? He disagrees, and having worked with   and Varun in two films, adds, “I don’t like calling them star kids. A lot has been said about nepotism. My father did everything to help me be what I am today. So if their parents help them, what’s wrong with that?”
