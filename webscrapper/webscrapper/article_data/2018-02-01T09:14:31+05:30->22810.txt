INDORE: The local  , which started a year ago on February 3 as a part of  , has recorded 2,307 complaints till date. Of them, most were related to ATM frauds, said police on Wednesday. 

 Of the 2,307 cases registered in 2017, maximum cases – 1065 – were related to ATM frauds. “Maximum cases were related to ATM frauds. Apart from this, over hundred cases related to lottery frauds were registered. Jobs and loans, insurance, online shopping, fake share trading companies, debit and credit cards and account related frauds were some other categories under which the cases were registered,” said ASP   Amrendra Singh. 
 
 The team has managed to solve the complaints received in three ways, claimed the ASP. 
 
 “We blocked the card or money in most of the cases or wherever it was possible. Some cases were registered and some others were asked to return money without registering cases,” said ASP Singh. 
 
 He added that a different trend was witnessed in the types of crimes in city. While most of the complaints received were related to the complainant being from the city, this year crime branch received complaints from people based out of other states and the accused were from Indore. 
 
 “The complainants and police reached out to us from different parts of the country as the cyber activities and frauds had taken place in Indore,” said ASP Singh adding that appropriate action was initiated in the matter. 
 
 Since the officials at city police stations are not entirely aware of the ways of handling cyber crimes, a special team of trained cops under the crime branch deals with the cases.
 
 “A team of five persons, including a senior officer and constables, handles these cases. They are trained for the same,” said ASP Singh.
