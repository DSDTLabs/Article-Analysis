Mumbai:   has reported a net profit of Rs 1,306 crore for the quarter ended June 2017, 16% lower than Rs 1,556 crore in the same period last year, but 7% higher than the preceding quarter.

 Analysts said that the profits were better-than-expected and that the slowing down of bad loans was encouraging. The bank’s loan book grew 12% to Rs 3.85 lakh crore, with retail loans growing 22%. Retail loans now account for 46% of all loans. 
 
 Overall deposits grew 10% as the bank shifted focus to low-cost current and savings accounts (CASA), which grew 25% year-on-year and now constitute 49% of deposits. The ratio of gross non-performing assets (NPAs) was steady at 5.03% compared with 5.04% as on end-March and 1.54% a year ago.
 
 According to Asutosh Kumar Mishra, senior research analyst,  , the profits were relatively higher than expected “On assets quality front, the bank delivered impressive performance led by the 27% sequential decline in fresh slippages to Rs 3,520 crore along with decline in watch list account outstanding”. He added that the high provision coverage ratio of 65% will help the bank sail through current challenging environment.
 
 Announcing the results, Axis Bank CFO Jairam Sridharan said that the bank’s turnaround was continuing to gather strength. “Return on equity is back in double digits. Our retail business continues to remain strong with robust CASA and loan growth,” he said.
 
 According to Sridharan, the rate of slippage of loans into NPA category is expected to stabilise to long-term average level in FY2019. He added that the four sectors which the bank had identified as high risk and made extra provisions for were power, iron and steel, infrastructure construction and telecommunication. These sectors constitute around Rs 30,000 crore of the bank’s loans.
