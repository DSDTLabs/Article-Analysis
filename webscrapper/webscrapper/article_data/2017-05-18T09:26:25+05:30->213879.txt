LUCKNOW: The Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court has asked the state government to provide detail before it on May 24 as to what steps had been taken for uninterrupted movement of   vehicles -- ambulances and fire brigades -- during   movements on roads for which traffic is brought to halt. It further asked the principal secretary, home, to file affidavit with better proposals of the state government in this regard.

 A bench of Justice   and Justice   (II) passed the above order on a pending PIL moved in 2010. It was said that during   movements the flow of traffic is adversely affected and many times it is seen that the emergency   also face serious problem in taking the serious patients to the hospital. The PIL cited many examples in which critical patients succumbed due to delay in treatment caused by blockade of traffic. The PIL had demanded that the state must ensure free movement of emergency vehicles during a road blockade and VVIP movements.
