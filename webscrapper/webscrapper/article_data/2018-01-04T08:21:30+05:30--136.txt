AHMEDABAD:   scooped a fistful of imaginary salt and flung it like a grenade into a vessel made of air. “If I were to add so much salt to a dish, it would be obliterated,” he said. Then he joined his right hand’s index finger and thumb and mimed the act of picking up a pinch of salt. The gesture was as gentle as the gathering light of the smile that emerges on a man’s face when he secretly sights his beloved across the room. “This is the amount of salt the dish needs,” Panditji said. “Have you ever noticed the delicate rhythm of cooking?”

 Panditji, the Kathak colossus, was speaking to TOI on Wednesday, a day after his presentation at Saptak. The word “kathak” comes from “katha”, meaning “story”. And in the interview on Wednesday, Panditji built the story of his art — revealed with anecdotes, personal reflections, and hand signs — to support kathak’s main message: the proof of life is dance. “That tree over there…doesn’t it look like a   with the hip bent and the arm thrust forward to make a dramatic point!” Panditji said.  , the most illustrious custodian of Panditji’s art, said: “People don’t pay attention to the fact that every aspect of their life is governed by rhythm.” Then Sen outlined one the greatest achievements of her guru: “He presents a classical tradition in a manner that is accessible to everybody.”
 
 Mamta Maharaj, Panditji’s daughter, amplified Sen’s point. “In the Saptak programme, one of my renditions portrayed the flow of water,”   said. “That familiar rhythm helped the younger members of the audience connect with the intricacy of kathak.”
 
 At this point, Panditji delivered the pièce de résistance. “A smile is secret music,” he said. If we returned to the lover and his smile at the sight of his beloved, Panditji’s statement can easily be attested by recalling the tempo of longing to which our hearts switch in similar circumstances.
