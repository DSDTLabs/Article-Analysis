 CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh district court, on Tuesday, acquitted a contractor in a case of   after former Chandigarh mayor   could not prove the allegations. The amount quoted was Rs 75 lakh. The court of civil judge   acquitted one contractor under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, 1881.
 
 The case dates back to April, 2014 when former mayor Poonam Sharma levelled allegations against Dhanas resident Naib Singh, a contractor. She said she wanted to buy property and the deal was to be struck at Rs 75 lakh with the contractor. However, she said the deal did not materialise and Naib Singh gave her a cheque on April 2, 2014, which bounced due to insufficient funds. At that, Sharma filed a case against him under Section 138 of the NI Act.
 
 Defence counsel   said liability in the case could not be proved. Sharma also said the cheque book was not issued in the name of Naib Singh but in the name of Harbans Singh, Naib Singhâ€™s brother and Naib Singh signed it by mistake. He was acquitted on these grounds. 
 
 The other argument put forward was that a conspiracy was hatched against Naib Singh by a person named  , who was his partner after both engaged in a dispute. In retaliation, Kulwinder handed over the cheque to Poonam Sharma and not Naib Singh.
