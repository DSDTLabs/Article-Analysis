NEW DELHI: A complaint about alleged misconduct on the part of a governor of a southern state has been received by the home ministry and is being investigated for its veracity. 

 The complaint is about the governor allegedly seeking sexual favours from women staff at the Raj Bhavan and the matter is being probed, sources said. The ministry has not yet commented on the identity of the governor concerned. 
 
 Sources said the Centre has taken a serious view of the allegations and has directed agencies to examine if thereâ€™s any evidence. If the complaint is found to have some basis, the governor will be asked to resign immediately.
 
 The last time a scandal involving a governor broke out was when then Meghalaya governor V   was asked to resign after complaints of a similar nature were received against him in January last year. 
 
 
 
 
 It is learnt that the governor in question has not been summoned by the Centre as yet. The Centre is concerned about the allegations as the state has been politically volatile. 
 
 In the case of Shanmuganathan, more than 100 employees of the Raj Bhavan had complained to the then President Pranab Mukherjee demanding his recall.
