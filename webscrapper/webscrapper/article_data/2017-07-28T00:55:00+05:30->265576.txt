Tirupur: A man tried to hand over his new   at the Tirupur north regional transport office on Wednesday after the authorities demanded a   of Rs 1,900 to register his vehicle. 

 K Nagarajan of Angeripalayam bought a scooter from a showroom on Avinashi Road in Periyar Colony on a loan after paying Rs21,000 as advance. But the vehicle was never registered even after 25 days since the sale, because he refused to pay the bribe, which the showroom claimed to be given to officials in the   office. So, he brought the scooter to RTO officer with a placard reading, “Since the bribe was not paid to RTO, registration was not done.” 
 
 “I bought the scooter for my daughter on June 30. The price quoted was around Rs 69,000 and I paid the advance before driving out the vehicle the same day. As asked by the showroom, I took a guarantor for completing the processing of the loan the next day. But when we enquired about the total cost, we were told that we should pay ‘handling charge’ of Rs1,900 and the showroom admitted that the amount was to bribe RTO officials,” said Nagarajan.
 
 “We refused to pay the bribe and all the issues started. Till now, they failed to bill the vehicle. Unfortunately, the government authorities have neither taken any steps to register nor have taken action against the showroom despite submission of the representations,” Nagarajan’s friend Palani Kumar, who accompanied him, said.
 
 The showroom staff members humiliated Nagarajan by calling him as a ‘thief’. A complaint was lodged at the Angeripalayam police, who provided only community service register (CSR), Palani Kumar said.
 
 Refuting the charges, Tirupur North RTO Sivaguru told TOI that “the billing was not done as the guarantor refused to put his sign in the loan document. No documents (regarding the vehicle) have reached us from the showroom. While the issue was between the seller and buyer, the latter is trying to divert the issue.”
