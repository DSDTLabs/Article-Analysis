GAYA: In the wake of recent incidents of communal strife in   town and other parts of the district, senior officials have mooted a two- pronged strategy — persuasive as well as coercive — to deal with hooligans and miscreants.

 DM Abhishek   on Sunday convened a meeting of the peace committee to involve the citizenry in the peace-keeping exercise. The meeting was attended by SSP   and other senior officials.
 
 DM Singh warned miscreants to refrain from sparking communal rift. “Respect for each other's faith was the basic ingredient of humanism,” said the DM.
 
 Besides advising the Holi committees to observe norms during ‘Holika dahan’, the DM also directed the officials to be strict with regard to the implementation of prohibition laws.
 
 “Certain areas having a mixed population and a history of tension during religious processions have been identified and figure prominently on the administration's radar,” the DM said, adding similar peace committee meetings would be held at the subdivision and police station levels as well.
 
 “Though Gaya has earned a name for its communal harmony record and tranquility even during the most turbulent times during the infamous   riots of 1946 and the post-Ayodhya cauldron in December 1992, of late some disturbing trend has been noted,” said activist Motibhai.
