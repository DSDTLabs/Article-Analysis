AHMEDABAD: Some residents of   resorted to a novel way to protest — they organized a prayer meeting to show their ire over the blocked town planning road, which is supposed to serve 1,000 residents of Sarvodaya Nagar.

  The residents held the prayer meeting on Sunday for two hours; some passers-by too attended the meeting.
 
  Acharya, Sejal Shukla, and other women of   society have taken up the issue. The women have been making representations to the corporation for opening up the road.
 
 “The road was sanctioned by the corporation in 2014 and all the procedures were completed, but the authorities are still to open the road for traffic,” Padmini said “We have contacted officers as well as the members of the elected wing over the past four years, but no solution has materialized.   up, we decided to raise our voice and held the prayer meeting.”
 
 Yogendra Acharya, a resident of the society, said: “On humanitarian grounds, the residents have allowed Sarvodaya Nagar people to use their road. Also, there is a 5 feet wall blocking the road that needs to be demolished, but the corporation has not done that. In the past, the   had informed the police about demolishing the wall and sought police protection.”
 
 The residents want municipal commissioner   to order a vigilance inquiry and also want to know how the garden department of the AMC has encroached upon a piece of land in the area.
