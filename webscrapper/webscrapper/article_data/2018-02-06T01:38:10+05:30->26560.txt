MUMBAI: Reconstruction of  , near Sandhurst Road station, may finally begin as the civic administration on Wednesday will table a proposal for awarding the contract for it before the civic standing committee meeting. The work will cost Rs 41 crore, officials said.

 Work had been delayed as   had to twice re-invite tenders. The tender floated last year did not include the Goods & Services Tax (GST) component. In May 2016, BMC, after calling for bids, awarded contracts for four bridges to two parties which were under police investigation in a road scam. One of the bridges included Hancock. An activist filed a PIL in Bombay high  , challenging the contracts as both contractors were tainted. 
 
 In July, HC cancelled the contracts in “the larger public interest”, prompting BMC to reinvite tenders. One contractor, J Kumar Infra, approached the SC, which granted it interim relief. But after the SC gave a green signal, BMC decided to re-tender the work keeping the GST component in mind.
 
 Last September, the state government told BMC to cancel tenders issued before August 22, 2017, where GST was not considered in the final costing. “Hence, keeping the notification in mind, a short tender was re-invited for a week,” said an official.
 
 Once the civic standing committee clears the proposal, work may begin in a fortnight, officials said. After the bridge was dismantled in January 2016, several track-crossing accidents occurred near Sandhurst Road.
