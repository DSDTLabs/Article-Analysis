KOLKATA:   at Sector V don’t seem to be rattled by the  . On the contrary, they are apparently counting on a   and a greater flow of work to India, and Bengal, if a void is created after some  

 “The consequences of Trump’s action against outsourcing of jobs may not augur ill with us,” said S Radhakrishnan, president, Sector V Stakeholders’ Association, referring to the order to block the entry of people from seven Muslim-majority nations. “I understand why thousands of people in the US are protesting against Trump’s move to block green-card holders from Muslim nations, and we support the US IT industry in saying the measures are immoral. But these orders may not affect Indians,” he said.
 
 Trump’s Muslim-nation order comes after two US senators mooted H1B visa norm amendment. “This is a bigger cause of worry as many Indians working in the US are on H1B and L1 visas,” said software   Amitanghshu Chatterjee. But the curb could also be good news for India, and Bengal, felt Kalyan Kar, vice-president, Sector V Stakeholders’ Association. “The lack of skilled manpower in the US will help us because outsourcing will continue, albeit in a different form,” said Kar. How’s that? “Trump is trying to evoke nationalism, some outsourcing will stall and some on-site immigrants, including Indians, will be sent back and firms will hire locals. But as hiring Americans will be expensive, most jobs will come to India, increasing work flow,” said the founder-MD of Inthink Knowledge Ventures.
 
 But some voice their concerns, especially when the $143-billion sector faces a slowdown. Trump’s move could take away US jobs using H1B visas, besides strict immigration laws. “If that’s bad news for innovation in Silicon Valley, it’s worse for Bengal, which projected Sector V as the ‘sunshine industry’,” said an HR manager. Florian Aamami, California’s Adapt Structural Concept Software CEO, seemed worried about Infosys and TCS. “They’re dependent on H-1B visas,” he said.
