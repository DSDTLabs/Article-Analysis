AHMEDABAD: In the syndicate meeting of   held last week, members appeared to have exercised their powers in favour of vested interests, as this was the final meeting with outgoing vice chancellor, M N  . Tasks including those of personal interest like saving certain jobs and even approvals for colleges were discussed and finalized at the last meeting, said well-placed sources. The meeting went on for about four and a half hours, against the usual hour-long meeting.

 Three members of the syndicate body, representing the BJP, put forth various talking points, just to continue the meeting. An important issue discussed related to contract renewal for the Gujarat University Convention Hall. However, no decision has been taken as vice chancellor M N Patel is to complete his term soon. The members felt that it would be better if the new vice chancellor took a call on the issue.
 
 Unlike the usual felicitation of the vice chancellor and discussing key decisions taken, nothing was discussed or even mentioned about MN Patelâ€™s term and his efforts.
