 D P Mahida, additional sessions judge, granted bail to the accused, Mohsinkhan  , (30), a city-based rickshaw-driver, on a bond of Rs 25,000.
 
 According to the case details, a 19-year-old boy alleged that Pathan befriended him on a social media site and on Janury 27, Pathan had asked him to come to a private hospital in   area where Pathan had pounced on him from behind and sodomized him brutally. The victim said in the police complaint that Pathan demanded Rs 10,000 from him for the act and threatened to defame him on social media if he failed to pay the amount.
 
  Following the complaint, Pathan was arrested by   police. Pleading for his bail, Pathan moved the petition through his advocate,  . 
 
 The accused did not have a criminal background and has never been booked for even a traffic violation. He is very calm and peace-loving man, said the plea.
 
 “It can not be accepted that one person attacks another person from behind and he could not get chance to run away. When it is very hard to insert thread in a needle then how can such activity is possible when the hands and legs of the victim were not tied,” added the plea. 
 
 He pleaded in the bail plea, “As per Indian culture, people are shying away from their sexual desire unlike in Western countries. It is the hardcore fact that sex is the primary physical need of any living human being on this earth. Too many problems come if a person does not get a life partner at proper time.” 
 
 “Homosexuality will disappear from the world the day, when we allow men and women to meet naturally. Homosexual relations will be stopped when the relations between opposite sex will be well accepted in our society,” added the plea.
