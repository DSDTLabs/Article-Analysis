Surat: Sugarcane farmers are happy as the gloomy season that stretched to three years for them ended on Friday with sugar cooperatives in south Gujarat announcing procurement prices for their produce which happen to be 30 per cent higher than last year. The sugarcane prices this season are almost double to that given to the farmers in 2015 because of less production, market deficit, higher recovery against crushing and higher rate for subsidiary products like molasses. 

 “The higher prices to farmers would not affect consumer prices because sugar is dependent on demand and supply dynamics. Unless demand goes very high, consumer market rates are unlikely to rise,” Madhi Sugar chairman Samir Bhakta said.
 
 Many sugar cooperatives had stopped crushing due to lack of sugarcane crop in February. However, the sugar cooperatives that continued to crush in March, which is peak month, have got higher recovery ratio and benefited. 
 
 Bardoli Sugar declared rates of Rs3, 954 per tonne for sugarcane. Bardoli Sugar chairman Pankaj Patel said, “We got higher production and 11.345 per cent recovery of sugar from the sugarcane due to late season crushing. Our farmers have benefited this season in good measure.” 
 
 Gujarat Khand Udyog Sangh chairman Mansinh Patel said, “This year, the processing has been less compared to last year because sugarcane production is 25 per cent less. Country’s sugar market is facing 20 per cent deficit while it is 8 per cent in international market. In such a scenario, these rates should motivate farmers to go back to sugarcane farming.” 
 
 The Gujarat Khand Udyog Sangh had recently declared stock value price at Rs3,400 per tonne and so it was expected that the sugar factories would announce comparable rates for sugarcane that they purchase from farmers in the region.
