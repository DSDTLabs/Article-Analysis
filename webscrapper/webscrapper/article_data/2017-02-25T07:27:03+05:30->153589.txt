MUMBAI: Observing that in the present scenario where many mothers are working, children left in the care of other family members, help and even trusting neighbours are becoming victims of sexual violence, a special court on Thursday sentenced a 24-year-old man to five years in jail for repeatedly sexually assaulting his minor neighbour. 

 The mother of the girl, who was then five years old, learnt about the assault after she enquired with the child when she saw her touching her private parts. It was then that the child told her mother that the accused used to do the same.
 
 The special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act court also directed the accused to pay a compensation of Rs 20,000 to the child for making good of the injury to the victim. 
 
 Referring to the nature of questions put forth before the child by the defence on the equations between her mother and the neighbours and a prior feud being a reason for the false implication, the court said that victims of that age do not understand witty questions. 
 
 “Their innocence about everything makes them more reliable, as they do not know the consequences,” the court said.
 
 The mother lodged the complaint with the   on December 4, 2015. She said that while her husband and she spent the day at the work, the child, after returning home from school would be looked after by the paternal grandfather.
