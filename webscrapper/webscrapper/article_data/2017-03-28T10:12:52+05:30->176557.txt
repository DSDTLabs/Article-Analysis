 “Asthma, nose allergy and skin allergy are not only the most common diseases in childhood but also pose an enormous health threat in adults. In order to assess magnitude of the problem and to understand causal factors in India, the study will be conducted,” Dr  , asthma specialist and national coordinator for the study, said. Similar study is also being planned in more than 100 countries globally.
 
 The last International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC), undertaken in 2002-03, found that around 6% children in India suffer from allergic diseases. In the 15 year period since the study was done, risk factors for allergy and asthma have increased significantly. Dramatic increase in traffic has led to pollution levels multiplying. Lifestyle factors like increase in female smoking and increasingly higher exposure to air-conditioned environments has magnified the exposure to risk for allergy and asthma. Food related allergies are on the rise as increased prosperity has led to higher intake of pre-cooked and processed food from outside, Dr Singh said.
