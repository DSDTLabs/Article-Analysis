MUMBAI: Amboli police on Wednesday arrested two   with 13.5kg   worth Rs 2.73 crore locally and Rs25 crore in the international market. Police learnt that Krishna Chaudhari (31) and Mukesh Takale (31) were working for international drug dealer Kailash  , who has settled in Dubai after his release on bail in 2014. Acting on a tip-off, investigating officer Daya Nayak stopped their Maruti Ertiga on finding something amiss in its number plate. 

 Chaudhari was a courier boy before he came in contact with Rajput. He allegedly took over responsibility of supplying drugs in Mumbai after he supplied food and took care of Rajput’s court case following his arrest by Customs air intelligence unit officers on September 9, 2012. 
 
 “The two were caught with drugs and have international links. They are connected to Kailash Rajput, whose name cropped up during last year’s raid by Delhi police,” said deputy commissioner of police (zone IX) Paramjit Singh Dahiya.
 
 A trap was laid on Tuesday night at Shastri Nagar in Andheri (W) after Nayak received a tip-off. The duo was frisked and 1kg MD was found on each of them. Further questioning led to the seizure of 11.5kg MD from their residence at Kandivli. Nayak learnt about a huge consignment brought to the city after he arrested two persons on December 30, 2017, and seized 3kg party drugs worth Rs60 lakh. During the probe, police learnt that the duo was associated with Rajput. “A probe is on to find out the location in Maharashtra or other places where the drugs are stored and supplied,” police said.
 
 An officer from Amboli police station said Rajput’s name cropped last year after Delhi police arrested SP leader Abu Azmi’s brother’s son, among four drug traffickers from Delhi and Punjab, and seized drugs worth over Rs 40 crore from them. The gang supplied drugs to rave parties in Mumbai, Chandigarh and Delhi, besides UK, US and the Middle East. They used to courier packets from Delhi and Mumbai airports.
