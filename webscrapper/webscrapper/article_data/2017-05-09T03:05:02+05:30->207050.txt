A youth died and a teenage girl was injured in police firing on a violent mob at village   under   area in   district, around 130km from Patna, on Monday. A police officer said tension started building up on Sunday evening as members of a community locked the entrance of the burial ground after the soil filling process at the village cremation ground was stopped.
 
  Sources said at least eight policemen were also injured as the mob started pelting stones on the police team stationed inside the burial ground. A riot control vehicle was set on fire and several other police vehicles were damaged by the mob protesting police bid to open the burial ground gate.
  
  The deceased was identified as Vijay Ram (22). The injured girl is Sundarika Kumari (17). Both were rushed to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) where doctors declared Vijay brought dead. DMCH superintendent Dr Santosh Kumar Mishra said Sundarika was undergoing treatment for the bullet injury in her thigh.
  
  Darbhanga DM   told TOI he had ordered the local police to lodge an FIR against the bodyguard of Sadar SDO Gajendra Prasad Singh for firing 25 rounds from his carbine without his boss’s permission.
  
    SDPO Anjani Kumar said the situation was under control after heavy police deployment in the area.
  
  “People of the majority community were upset as the land filling process on their cremation ground was stopped sometime back by members of the minority community. The cremation and the burial grounds are in the same vicinity. People from the majority community were demanding immediate restart of the filling process before opening the burial ground,” said a source.
  
  “One Mohammad Ali Hassan died on Sunday. When the police intervened and opened the gate on Monday morning for his burial, people from majority community got violent and started pelting policemen with stones and damaged the vehicles forcing us to open fire,” a police officer said.
