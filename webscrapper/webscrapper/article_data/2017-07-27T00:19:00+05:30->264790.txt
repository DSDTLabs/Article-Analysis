Saligao: The issue of construction of a football ground dominated the Saligao gram sabha held on Sunday. Issues such as the operation of illegal gaddas, a panchayat hall, sports ground, market complex, garbage vehicles, widening of roads and parking of vehicles on the roads in the village were also discussed at the meeting. Attorney of Saligao comunidade Austin da Gama told the gram sabha that there are around 72 illegal structures in the village fields for which the comunidade has not given any NOC. The villagers questioned the sarpanch as to whether the panchayat is taking any step against the illegal gaddas that are causing traffic problems due to haphazard parking of vehicles near the gaddas. Sarpanch Lafira Gomes read out the rules framed while issuing licences to the gaddas and said that they cannot be sublet, which is being done. She said that action will be taken as per law.  The villagers said that construction of a football ground is the need of the hour. The sarpanch said that talks on the issue are on with the Saligao comunidade committee and the farmers, and that the local MLA has assured to construct the ground at the earliest.  A villager also raised the issue of trucks from different villages passing through the village roads to the garbage plant resulting in a stink emanating on these stretches.
