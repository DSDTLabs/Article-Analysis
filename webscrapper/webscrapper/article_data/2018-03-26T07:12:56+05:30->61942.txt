HYDERABAD: At a time when teaching in schools has seen a paradigm shift from traditional blackboards to digital screens across the country, the Telangana government has not even incorporated computer education into the state curriculum despite talk of its inclusion from the ensuing academic year. Educationists have expressed dismay at this, especially since Hyderabad is being projected as the new   of India.

  
  
 While the government has introduced Information Communication and Technology ( ) tools to teach other subjects, it has not introduced a separate subject covering even the basics of computer science.
 
 “The state government’s apathy comes as an unpleasant surprise when Hyderabad is seen as an information technology hub in the country. There is no curriculum or formal assessment test for ICT as a core subject,” said S Madhusudan, president of Hyderabad Private Schools Association.
 
 School managements in Telangana claim that since the state government has failed to introduce curriculum and text books for ICT, they have no choice but to dependent on private players for ICT resources.
 
 When 
  contacted  , director of State Council of Educational Research and Training, she passed the buck on the school education department saying the SCERT has little role in framing the curriculum. But the function of the Telangana SCERT on it’s official website clearly states that it is responsible for “development of syllabus, course ware, training manuals and teaching learning materials” including ICT.
