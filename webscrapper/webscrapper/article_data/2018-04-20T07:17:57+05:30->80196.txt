NAGPUR: The anti-corruption wing of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Nagpur branch, under the supervision of SP,  ,  , arrested senior auditor   and auditor   from a hotel at Washim on Thursday. The senior officials posted at Accountant General (Audit II) in Nagpur were nabbed allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs10,000. 

 Shukla and Nandanwar were demanding monetary favour from the office-bearers of Kata villages’ Panchayat Samiti and Gram Panchayat for mentioning minimum possible audit objections for the financial year 2018-19. It has now come to fore that the two auditors had placed similar offers for malpractices in front of office bearers of several other civic authorities of Washim. 
 
 There was a specific complaint against the auditors lodged by office bearers of Kata’s local civic bodies, which led to the action. The CBI officials had laid a trap at the Washim hotel, where the auditors had summoned representatives of Kata village civic body, to collect the demanded cash. The auditors had assured the village civic body representatives that they would extend the promised help only after the cash is handed over, or else they would initiate action.
 
 CBI officials, after arresting the auditors, are now interrogating them. A search operation too was underway, it was learnt, while going to the press.
