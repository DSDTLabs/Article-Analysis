MUZAFFARNAGAR: A day after a selfie clicked by three prisoners went viral on social media,   superintendent has cited ‘staff shortage’ and ‘location of the jail in a residential area’ as the main reasons behind the security lapse.
 
  In a written explanation submitted to the district magistrate and senior superintendent of police, jail superintendent A K   said, “Prohibited items are often thrown into the jail premises making it difficult to keep vigil with the limited number of staff members available.”
  
  “At present, the jail has 2,500 inmates and just 68 staff members, instead of the sanctioned strength of 138. This is despite being counted as one of the most sensitive jails in the state,” he added.
  
  Meanwhile, police have registered a case against the three inmates, Vijay Chaudhary, Mohit Kumar and  , under section 42 of Prisons Act late on Saturday night.
