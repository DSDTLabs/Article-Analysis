MADURAI: A two-week extension has been given to the Santhanam committee appointed by the governor to submit its report on the scandal involving   Devanga Arts College assistant professor Nirmala Devi and alleged higher officials in the  . The extension has come at the last minute, as the committee was to submit its report on Monday as per the initial timeframe given.

 The committee was formed after a phone conversation in which Nirmala Devi was heard luring a group of girls from her college to do sexual favours for higher official in MKU surfaced a couple of weeks ago. Committee chairman   told TOI that he had asked for an extension and the governor’s office had given him two weeks more. He would conduct inquiry with assistant professor of MKU, V Murugan, and former research scholar of the university, Karuppasamy on Wednesday. 
 
 Incidentally, the custody of Murugan and Karuppasamy given to CB-CID ended on Monday. They were produced before Srivilliputhur court which ordered judicial remand for 15 days. Initially, Aruppukkottai town police registered a case on April 16 based on a complaint from college secretary R Ramasamy. The CB-CID, which took over the case from the Aruppukkottai town station the very next day, speeded up the inquiry and arrested Murugan and Karuppasamy.
 
 Santhanam committee has so far completed two phases of inquiry in the last two weeks. During his visit to Madurai last week, he conducted inquiry with Nirmala Devi, who is lodged in the women’s section of Madurai central prison. He also visited Devanga Arts College and took statements from the college authorities as well as the girls who complained against the assistant professor. MKU vice-chancellor P P Chellathurai, registrar V Chinniah and other higher officials were also quizzed during the probe.
