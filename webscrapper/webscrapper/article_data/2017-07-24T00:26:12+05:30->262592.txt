Bhopal: Three days of rain did improve water level in the   and Kolar reservoir. But the rise is water table is still quite less than the corresponding period in last year as it has not yet rained good in the catchment area.

 Avinash Srivastava, city engineer, BMC said “On Sunday, water level in Kolar reservoir was 449.24 metre, which is still 12.96 metre less than full tank level.” In last three days, the water has increased 70 cm in the dam. It did not rain much in the catchment area of the reservoir.”
 
 “Last year till now, it had touched 455 metre level , which was far more than present condition,” said Srivastava.
 
 “Nadan” forest area is the main catchment area for Kolar reservoir. BMC officer said, “We can expect major increase in the two water bodies only after rain in these areas.”
 
 “As ground absorbs early rain, there is a slow increase in water level initially. But there comes a point when ground water gets saturated after which, water level goes up fast, which is mostly seen in late July,” BMC official said.
 
 While the water level of Upper Lake on Sunday was 1659.59 feet, which is still 7.21 feet lesser than full tank level. SM Dubey, city engineer, said “It is less compared to last year. In 2016, Bhadbhada gates were opened twice till this time.”
 
 He said “In last three days, the water table was up by a foot. This year, the lake still looks somewhat empty. Rain the catchment area determines water table in reservoirs. As the water level in Kolans river, the catchment area for the Upper Lake, was less, the increase in the city’s lifeline was not appreciable. When there is rainfall in Sehore region, water table in Kolans River rises and this leads to an increase in the Upper Lake’s level. Kolans river has now started getting water, we hope Upper Lake level will be up towards the end of July, says BMC Official.
