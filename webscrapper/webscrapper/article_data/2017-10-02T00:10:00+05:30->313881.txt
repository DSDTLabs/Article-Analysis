Bhopal: A sub-divisional officer of police shot himself with his service revolver and committed suicide at his official residence in Morena district on Sunday afternoon. Reason for the police office resorting to the extreme step is not known.

 The SDOP, Hemant Sisodia, a native of Guna district was posted in Sabalgarh in Morena and was about to retire in less than a year’s time. He was living alone while his family was in Guna.
 
 The incident took place at around noon after Sisodia returned to his residence from his office, said police. 
 
 “In his office he told his gunman to get his pistol at around 11.30 am,” SP Morena Aditya Pratap Singh told TOI. After he reached his residence, his gunman and driver left for lunch leaving Sisodia with his domestic help, Singh said.
 
 “His driver hardly managed to turn the vehicle when Sisodia went in, took out his uniform, sat on his bed and shot himself dead,” he added. 
 
 “It is a sad incident. He was about to retire in 6-7 months and had requested for a transfer to his home district, Guna, which was approved. He was a jolly person. Prima facie appears there was some family dispute related to property and it seems to be the trigger for the incident,” Singh said. 
 
 His domestic help who was in the bathroom at that time rushed out after hearing the bullet shot sound said sources. 
 
 Seeing the officer in blood, the domestic help informed the local police station in-charge. The domestic help, who was working at the residence of Sisodia for more than six years told police that the officer had never shared anything that worried him. He was normal and never talked about any problem, said police. 
 
 The official residence of Sisodia was sealed and forensic teams were summoned, while the senior officials including the district superintendent of police inspected the spot. Kin of the police officer have been informed about the incident, police said.
