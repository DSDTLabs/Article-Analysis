CHENNAI: The   near the   has turned accident-prone since the last two three days due to sewage stagnation.

  The path along the Metro Rail construction site has become responsible for the slowdown in movement of traffic on the adjoining Poonamallee High Road.
 
 Tunnelling work on the underground metro rail station near Ripon Buildings had been completed long ago and it is suspected that the sewage stagnation could be due to seepage from Metrowater’s sewer pipelines.
 
  A Chennai Metro Rail Limited official said denied the stagnation due to metro rail construction work. CMRL is currently carrying out work on construction of the underground station to come up near Ripon Buildings.
 
 A Metrowater official said that the stagnation was not due to seepage from Metrowater’s pipelines. “We will check the area that was waterlogged again on Monday. If we find that it is due to leakage from one of our lines, we will fix it immediately,” he said.
 
  who commutes through Sydenhams Road said, “The narrow path has been stagnated for at least three days. Authorities have not bothered to fix the leak. The stagnation has turned the path into a bottleneck.”
