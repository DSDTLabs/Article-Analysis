BERHAMPUR: The state government has sanctioned Rs 5 crore to the   for infrastructural developments to the playground of the Khallikote (Autonomous) College. 

 "We have received a letter of sanction of the amount from the government. The construction of at least two toilet complexes and water supply facilities, in addition to basketball court renovations and setting up of the sports council office can be accomplished with the funds," said vice-chancellor, Khallikote Cluster University, M M Padhy.
 
 At present, there are no toilets or water supply to the grounds, even though several sportspersons and fitness enthusiasts are regulars there. 
 
 Several private organisations, including private colleges, conduct sports meets and tournaments at the   play grounds. 
 
 "Several people of the town use the grounds every morning for their morning walks. We thanked the government for sanctioning the funds for the development of the grounds," said Prakash Chandra Panda, former lecturer in physical training education at the college. He urged university authorities to start coordination with the construction agency and get to work soon. 
 
 "The government has also sanctioned Rs one crore for the construction of two toilet complexes -- one for boys and the other for girls -- at the Khallikote (Autonomous) College," said Panda. Most of the existing toilets in the century-old college had been in a dilapidated condition.
 
 College authorities had drawn attention to the condition of the toilets in the college to the higher education minister   during his recent visit to the campus. The minister had then assured that the government would provide financial assistance to the college for construction of toilet complexes and for infrastructural development of the playground.
