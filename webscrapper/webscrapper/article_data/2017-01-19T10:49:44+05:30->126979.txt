TRICHY: Amid the raging protests, villagers at Manapparai and Navalur Kuttapattu near here managed to conduct   on Wednesday defying the   ban. The bull tamers were rewarded too after the event but the cops who came towards the end seized the bulls and filed a case against the organisers. 

 Until the ban was imposed a couple of years ago, jallikattu was an annual affair every January 18 at Avarampatti village in Manapparai. After offering prayers at St Antony's Church, every year bulls used to be unleashed on the ground opposite to the church. 
 
 On Wednesday, about 40 bulls from neighbouring villages were brought to the ground. Braving the early morning chill, villagers gathered at 4 am and unleashed the bulls only to be tamed by bull tamers who came in from various places. The organisers maintained such high secrecy that the local police couldn't get wind of it, said sources in the village. However, police reached the spot after the event and seized some of the bulls brought from outside the village. 
 
 When asked, Vaiyampatti police claimed that no such event was held at the village and enquiry was on with the church administration on any attempt to conduct it. Similar jallikattu incident was reported in Navalur Kuttapattu after a request by villagers for organising the event was denied by the police. On Wednesday, bulls were brought from various places for the sport, but police moved in fast when a few of the bulls were released. After an altercation, the villagers dispersed from the spot with their bulls following a strict warning. 
 
 Last year, it was a fulfilling Pongal for Navalur Kuttapattu villagers when they managed to hold jallikattu. Police rushed to the spot on seeing messages which went viral on WhatsApp but only to find the arena empty as locals had fled the spot sensing their arrival.
