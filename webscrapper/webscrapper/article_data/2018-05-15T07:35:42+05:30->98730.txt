BHOPAL: Sagar people were in for a surprise when a civil contractor held an impromptu party after his son failed in Class 10 board examination on Monday.

 
 Firecrackers, sweets and shamiyana — everything was present in this odd celebration.  , a resident of   ward said, "This is how I want to motivate my son. After failing in exams, children go into depression and some of them even take the extreme step of ending their lives. I want to tell such children that boards are not the last exams. There is much more to come in life,” he said, adding, "My son can reappear in the exam again next year."
 
 His son Ashu said, “I appreciate my father. I promise to study more in the next academic session to pass with excellent marks.”
 
 Friends and neighbours came in large numbers to attend the party.
