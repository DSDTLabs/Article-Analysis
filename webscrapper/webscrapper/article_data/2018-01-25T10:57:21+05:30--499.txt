PUNE: For a while now, Mumbai-based property consultant Ajay Shah has been spending nearly half the week at his stable in   to look after his horses. On January 26, he will be taking part in The   Horse  , an equestrian sport, all for his passion for riding.

 “I attend to my five horses in Lonavla at least thrice a week. Horses and equestrian sports are my passion. I have been riding since 1972 and the Endurance Championship is just an extension of that passion. Riding has helped me keep fit because of the concentration and balancing skills that go into it,” the 67-year-old remarked.
 
 Besides, he is participating “not for the prize”, but for the thrill. “I am one of the oldest participants. So I am happy to have qualified and I will compete on the 20km course,” said Shah.
 
  
 This will be Shah’s second Endurance Championship, alongside 54 others, as they run through various locales in and around Lonavla on January 28, after two days of preparation and evaluation of horses. The organizers,   (IHOA), have divided the entire sand-and-stone course into three lengths — 20km, 40km, and 60km. The breed of horses on use is the Marwari, endemic to the subcontinent and largely bred in Maharashtra and southern India.
 
 “Endurance is a unique form of equestrian sport because, unlike horse-racing, it places a lot of emphasis on the horse’s health. In each course, let’s say of 20 kms, the rider has to bring back the horse in a given time, assuming one hour. After the course is complete, veterinarians will check their heart rate and other vitals and the rider can take the horse on another course only if the heart rate is brought back down to normal. The advantage is with the horses and riders whose vitals are brought to normal faster. The winner, therefore, will be the one who takes care of the animal better and does not exhaust it too much,” explained Khushru Patel, IHOA vice-chairman.
