NEW  : Trying to prevent a robbery, a   riding in a moving autorickshaw stoutly held on to her bag, but was   on to the road and suffered injuries and had to be taken to AIIMS Trauma Centre. Police are scanning CCTV footage for clues to the motorcyclists who tried to grab her bag near Lajpat Nagar on Sunday night.

 The woman, who is from Manipur, works in the credit card department of a bank and was returning after a visit to Maharani Bagh, where she claimed to have gone to buy a mobile phone. She told police that she had noticed the black motorcycle following the autorickshaw for some time before robbery bid. Around 9.30pm, when she reached the Lajpat Nagar flyover and the three-wheeler slowed down, the two men grabbed her bag. But she held on and was pulled out of the autorickshaw.
 
 The woman hit her face on the road and was dragged for a few metres by the bikers until she let go of the bag. The   driver stopped and helped her up. She asked him to drive her to a hospital, but changed her mind when he took a wrong turn. She went instead to her cousin’s house in Munirka and informed the police, who took her to AIIMS.
 
 “She was given basic medical aid. An FIR was also registered,” said the woman’s friend. However, after complaining of pain in her chest, she returned to the hospital on Monday morning. The friend added that they had provided the cops the details of the woman’s phone that was in the snatched bag to help them track the robbers.
 
 The woman said that the bag also contained Rs 2,000 that she withdrew from an ATM in Maharani Bagh. She believed that the   could have been following her after that. The resident of Manipur’s Senapati district has been in Delhi for seven years now. Her family has been informed about the incident.
 
 “A case has been registered and we are probing the matter,” DCP (southeast) Romil Baaniya said.
