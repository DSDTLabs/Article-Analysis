NAVI MUMBAI: Local residents and activists are irked over continuous burning of dry garbage and dumping of debris in the   area along   extension road in   and Koparkhairane. Mangroves have been killed in the past two days while forest officials pleaded helplessness.

 Forest officials allege that they have caught the   contract workers engaged in cleaning activities red-handed. They have been dumping and setting fire to trash in order to swiftly dispose off garbage in the nearby mangrove area and save on transport cost in the run up to Swachh Survekshan.
 
 There have been two such instances of fire on Tuesday and Wednesday at separate locations along the mangrove patch. NMMC senior officials have assured that stern action against the civic contractor will be taken soon for damaging the marine green cover and illegally dumping debris in non-designated area.
 
 Activists said that mangroves were affected after garbage was burnt in the reserved forest for the last couple of days. “The forest department should file an FIR against the culprits irrespective of authorities for burning mangroves and debris dumping,” said Anarjit Chauhan, an activist.
 
 On Tuesday, two forest guards Monirul Islam and Sunny Patil and a round officer P R Gaikwad reached the fire spot along Palm Beach extension road. On Wednesday, another group of workers were seen burning trash along a mangrove stretch. TOI spotted the group setting the mangroves on fire on Wednesday and brought it to the notice of NMMC and forest department.
