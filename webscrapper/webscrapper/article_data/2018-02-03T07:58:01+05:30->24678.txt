On Friday, at a 70s inspired   in Mumbai, filmmaker   and Bollywood diva   exhibited their retro charm and channelled their inner rockstars in edgy, super-blingy pantsuits and sharp-cut coats.

 While Sona opened the show, KJo closed it with his pouty act and uber-confident walk. Taking about the actress opening a menswear collection, which happens to be the designers’ debut in this segment, they said, “We decided to introduce the men’s collection about 15 days before the show and we designed the clothes keeping Karan in mind. But the inspiration is from the 70s when people listened to the kind of music they liked—rock and jazz. That’s the feel as we are very musically inclined…And the men’s collection had to start with a woman walking the ramp first.” To which, Sonakshi replied saying, “Yes men’s collection should open with a woman and men could take over from there. Thanks for making me look like a rock star.”
 
 When Karan Johar, who had dyed his hair grey for the show, was asked if he was apprehensive about being the showstopper for a blingy collection, he jokingly said, “I am half Sindhi so bling is my thing. I think men should not shy away from bling…Ever since   joined Bollywood, wearing everything seems normal (laughs). He has taken men’s fashion to a different level altogether. I absolutely adore him. I think this collection is going to be his favourite.”
