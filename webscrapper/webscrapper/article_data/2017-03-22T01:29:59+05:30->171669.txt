NAVI MUMBAI: Festival time means Indian food at its scrumptious best and   is no different. 

 The   new year is barely a week away and homemakers have started planning for new   apart from the old, conventional dishes. 
 
 Puran poli, shrikhand, aam ras, aam panna, kesari bhaat are some of the traditional dishes which are made in every Maharashtrian home to celebrate the joy of togetherness. Most women are looking for recipes that are a mix of both. 
 
 “Shrikhand, a must-have on Gudi Padwa, ensures a sweet year ahead,” said Sadhana Ghanti, a food specialist from Kharghar. “It is a simple recipe made with hung curd. One can produce a variety of taste by mixing flavours or using toppings like fresh grapes. One can also get a mixed taste by using both angoor and aam,” Ghanti said.
 
 Another Kharghar resident, Sulochana Koli, said her plan was to prepare chocolate chip and kiwi shrikhand, strawberry and biscuit shrikhand pudding. She had picked up some ideas from cookery shows. 
 
 Padwa stands for a family get-together with a lavish lunch after a puja is conducted for the gudis.
 
  Nita Kulkarni, a homemaker from Vashi, said, “Panchamrit, a spicy, sweet and sour concoction can be served as a separate dish.” Padwa is incomplete without batatyachi bhaji, thalipeeth or kesari bhath, she said.
