AHMEDABAD: Vijay ‘VG’  , Coxe Distinguished Professor at Dartmouth College’s  , and author of books such as ‘Reverse Innovation’ and ‘Beyond the Idea’, spoke on the theme of his book, ‘The Three Box Solution’, at Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad ((IIM-A) on Saturday evening.

 Govindarajan explained that he sees three boxes as ‘Manage the Present’, ‘Selectively Forget the Past’ and ‘Create the Future’. He said that any corporate firm has to manage all the three aspects of business to be successful. He gave the example of innovation such as developing low-cost ECG for developing nations as a disruptive solution instead of downscaling the existing model.
 
 “We can also look at the example of Olympics high jump history,” he said.
 
 “It started with the scissors technique. Over the decades, the champions devised new methods to raise the bar with western roll and straddle. But it was Fosbury Flop - a totally unconventional approach to the sport - which found success. It was a disruptive method,” Govindarajan said.
 
 He also talked about different phases of a company and advised that along with the present, they also should look at the future. “In other words, the firms have a core business to look after. To grow and be future-ready, they should explore the adjacent space and look at disruptive business model,” he said.
 
 He also drew parallels between the   and the role of a leader as creator, preserver and destroyer of ideas.
