 Police say the girl had met Vinay Dhoble, a 34-year-old dentist by training, at a wedding in   a few months ago, after which they became friends on Facebook. Dhoble apparently told the girl he wanted money to set up a dental clinic so that he could be financially independent and marry her. Taken in by his assurances, she started stealing valuables from her home. 
 
 Dhoble, who comes from a well-off family, had met the girl at least 10 times at Kalyan railway station, where he would ask her to come with valuables. He would sell the valuables to jewellers in Kalyan and spend the money on betting at horse races in Pune, police said. 
 
 On Saturday, when cops, along with the girl, visited Dhoble's house in Khadaki area in Pune, he was missing. Police said Dhoble's parents were shocked to learn about his cheating his girlfriend.
 
 The crime came to light when the girl's parents found valuables missing from home and confronted her. Initially, she told her parents that two armed burglars had broken into their home, tied her up and fled with the valuables a few days earlier. 
 
 Her father, who runs a garage, immediately filed a complaint at the local Vithalwadi police station. Cops doubted the girl's story due to contradictions in her statement and asked her whether she had made it all up. The girl finally admitted the truth, saying she had stolen the valuables to help her boyfriend in his business.
 
 The police said a team is camping in Pune to search for Dhoble. Police also suspect that he may have cheated other girls too. Mohan Waghmare, senior inspector of Hill Line police, said, "Once we arrest the suspect, we will investigate if he cheated any other girl similarly."
