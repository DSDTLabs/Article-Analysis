Pune: The   are taking to the road once again. This time, women bikers from across the country will unite to celebrate the 11th edition of International Female Ride Day on May 6. 

 Bikerni is an all-women organisation that encourages female bikers from across the country. Annually, an event is held to bring together all members of the organisation. Every event is associated with a cause and, this year, the group aims to create awareness about the safety of women travelling around the city, particularly at night. 
 
 Women bike riders from all over the country unite in Hyderabad and undertake take a night ride along all historical monuments in the city to promote women safety.
 
 “Fifteen female riders from   will attend the event but only 10 will ride all the way to Hyderabad. The rest might take a flight or go along in a car as few of them are amateurs and don’t prefer long journeys yet,” said Vartika Pandey, founding member of Bikerni.
 
 The bikers will be flagged off from the city at 4am on May 5. They hope to reach Hyderabad by 4pm. After attending the event on May 6, they will ride back the next day. “We are planning to take four halts after every 150km. I will be riding my Royal Enfield Thunderbird 350cc,” said Nainaaz, a Camp resident, who has been riding bikes for almost 15 years.
 
 A city-based two-wheeler repair service provider conducted a workshop for the women riders on April 30 and taught them to fix minor glitches themselves. “We trained them to fix minor defects so that they do not have to depend on others and waste their time waiting for help. This will make them self sufficient and save their time,” said Azam Shaikh, co-founder of the repair service Tight The Nut.
 
  The International Female Ride Day is observed annually and encourages women to ‘Just Ride’. It highlights women bikers who enjoy riding without any bar on the form, class and style of riding.
