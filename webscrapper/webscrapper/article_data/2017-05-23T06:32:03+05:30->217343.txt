AHMEDABAD: Several students who opted for admissions under   are in a fix as they either got   at a school far from their residence or at a school which is shut down or a minority school. The   has received more than 8,800   over these and other issues. However, in a meeting held between director of primary education, M I Joshi, and district education officers (DEOs), it was decided that only 800 complaints are valid and need to be addressed immediately.

 These complaints include students who have been wrongfully admitted in terms of the medium of education (English/ Gujarati) or in a school that is far from their residence, or admissions in single-sex school, minority schools or in schools that have shut down. There are only 800 such complaints.It has been nine days since the state education department allocated admissions to around 63,593 students under RTE against 80,000 applications, leaving around 17,000 students in the lurch. 
 
 There is still no clarity on the fate of these 17,000 students, and the only step the department has taken is to ask DEOs to prepare a list of schools ready to admit more than 25% of students under RTE. However, out of 63,593 students allocated admissions, only 11,000 students i.e. 17.2% students have reported to schools until now. The deadline for reporting is May 25. In case students donâ€™t report to schools to confirm their admissions in time, the remaining 17,000 students, who did not get allocation, will be given preference.
