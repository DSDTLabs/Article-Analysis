 actor   has said he does not consider himself as someone exceptionally handsome. 

  
  
 The 33-year-old   was in the coastal state yesterday to participate in an event, a gathering of advertising and marketing professionals. 
 
  Responding to a question on how does he go beyond his 'good looks' as an actor, Sidharth said, "I think people love to see good faces on screen. I don't consider myself as more than an average-looking guy. I don't believe there is something exceptional in the way I look." 
 
  The actor, however, said he is enjoying his celebrity status as he has worked hard to achieve the position he is in. 
 
 "I lived a regular lifestyle   running as much as I can. We work all our life to get this fame which we should enjoy. I am very much enjoying all the perks that I get as a celebrity," he said 
 
 During a rapid fire round, Sidharth gave a tongue-in-cheek reply on his ' '. 
 
 When asked whether he is single or committed, he said, 'It depends on who is asking it.'.
