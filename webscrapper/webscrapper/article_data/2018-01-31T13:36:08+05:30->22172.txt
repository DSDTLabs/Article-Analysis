PATNA: Formation of human chain by Union minister of state for HRD Upendra Kushwaha-led Rashtriya Lok Samata Party ( ) for educational reforms in the state on Tuesday did not go down well with state education minister  , who said the government was trying its best to ensure quality education under the leadership of chief minister  .

 “Instead of forming human chain, Kushwaha, who is Union HRD minister, should have suggested ways to improve the education system in the state. Both of us are from Bihar and it is our duty to work for the development of the state. Kushwaha ji can do a lot in the field of education. He should help us in getting funds from the Centre so that we can provide various facilities under   ( ),” Verma said. 
 
 Verma said late release of funds by the Centre and reduction in central government’s assistance was making it difficult for the state government to pay teachers on time. “The Centre is now bearing only 60% of the cost under SSA. Earlier, the Centre’s share was 75%,” Verma added.
 
 The minister said he was always open to suggestions and Kushwaha should have called him and discussed the problems. “Since he is a central minister, I will definitely incorporate his suggestions. Instead of acting like an opposition neta, Kushwaha should guide us to do better,” Verma said.
 
 He added the human chain formation by RLSP was a “political step”.
 
 Meanwhile, Kushwaha said Bihar was getting sufficient funds from the Centre. “If there was a funds crisis, the state government should have consulted me. The matter could have been taken up with the Union finance ministry,” Kushwaha said.
