 Coimbatore: District collector T N Hariharan on Tuesday ordered the owners of patta land to remove seemai karuvalem (an invasive species) from their land, failing which they would invite action by the district administration. 
 
 “If we find invasive species in residences, buildings and other locations, notices will be issued to them and they would be given time to remove the trees. If they fail to remove the trees even after the notice, the district administration will remove the trees and the owners will be charged double the amount for the job done. We will convene another meeting on March 31,” said Hariharan. Every week, the officials will go on an inspection. All the government departments, city corporation and other government establishments have been asked to remove these species from their premises. 
 
 The collector has also requested the residents to support in this cause and take part in the activities. The public works department officials said that they had already initiated the work by engaging NGOs and other agencies to remove these trees from lakes and water channels. “We have removed all the trees from Perur tank. We have started the work in Kolrampathy kulam, Kurichi tank, Narsampathy tank and Sengulam. We will remove them from other lakes as well,” said Kumarasamay, sub-divisional officer of PWD. 
 
 City corporation officials said that they had already begun the work in the reserve sites. “In various parks and empty sites, the officials are engaging in removing these species that pose a threat to the ground water level and also to our native species,” said an official. 
 
 Kumarasamy said companies, colleges and other organisations should take responsibility and take part in the drive. “Instead of depending on the government, residents should take it up. This drive should be continuously done for three years if we want to eradicate it completely,” he said.
