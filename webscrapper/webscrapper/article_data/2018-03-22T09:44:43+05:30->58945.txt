 Chaudhari said that the brass bell is an instruction bell and is rung based on the time-table followed by each class. 
 
 “There are other parallel exams and classes happening at the school which also get disturbed due to such mischief,” he said, adding that the school is facing such a problem only from students of Zenith School every year. 
 
 “Even this year, we have faced no problems in other exams. It was only in this particular paper that things got disturbed,” he said, adding that 450 students are appearing for the board exams every day at the school.
