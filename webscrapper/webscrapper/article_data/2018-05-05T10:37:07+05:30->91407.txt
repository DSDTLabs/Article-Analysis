 "Our goal is to make sure that he never walks in the community again, that he spends the rest of his life in the penitentiary, and I believe this sentence will achieve that result,"   District Attorney Steve Howe said after the sentencing, reports said.
 
 In an arrangement, Adman Purinton had pleaded guilty to the killing which took place on February 22, 2017, in a bar. Adam Purinton was alleged to have shouted, “Get out of my country” before he shot at Garmin engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla. In the incident, a colleague of Kuchibhotla, Alok Madasani, also of Hyderabad, India and Ian Grillot of the US, were injured. They have recovered.
 
 “Today’s sentencing in the murder of my husband will not bring Srinu to me. But it has sent out a very strong message that hate is not acceptable. I would like to thank the district attorney’s office and the Olathe police department for the efforts in bringing a closure to the case and bringing this man to justice. But we are not done yet. There is still a long way ahead of us and building a safe community for all of us,” Sunayana Dumala said in a video statement after the court pronounced the verdict.
 
 "I hope in the years that you must spend in the jail you will one day realize the magnitude of your mistake and work toward your penance," she said to Adam Purinton.
