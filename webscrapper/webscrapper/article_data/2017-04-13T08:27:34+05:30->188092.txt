MUMBAI:The   ( ) has given permission to only 33 big slaughterhouses in the state and the rest are illegal, said officials on Wednesday. 
 In the Mumbai metropolitan region, there are only two large slaughterhouses, one in Deonar and another in Kalyan and both have all clearances in place. Traders said that while buffaloes can be slaughtered only in the Deonar and Kalyan abattoirs, there are small slaughterhouses called 'chamber houses', which function on special licences that allow them to slaughter sheeps and goats. Mumbai has just one official slaughterhouse at Deonar. Mumbai Suburban Beef Dealers' Association's   said that there is hardly any illegal slaughterhouse in the city. "Some butchers have special permission to slaughter goats. Otherwise all slaughter is done at Deonar. It is duty of the municipal authorities who run the slaughterhouse to ensure that all norms are met," Qureishi said. 
 
 MPCB conducted checks in many cities, including Mumbai, Pune Nashik and Nagpur, following the Uttar Pradesh g overnment's crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses. Officials said big slaughterhouses were checked for the waste disposal mechanism before they were given permission. A big slaughterhouse is one where more than ten animals are slaughtered in a day. In Pune, according to MPCB, the big ones-two in Dehu Road and one in Kondhwa-are monitored by MPCB, while the smaller slaughterhouses are monitored and checked by corporation authorities.
