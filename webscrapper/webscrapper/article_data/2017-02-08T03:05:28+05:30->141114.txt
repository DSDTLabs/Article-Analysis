We cannot lodge complaint because in most cases local politicians are involved,” the principal of a school in the western suburbs said at a ceremony organized by the School Bus Owners’ Association to honour schools, bus operators, drivers and attendants.
 
 School principals and management representatives said the   and the traffic police must take action against those plying vehicles illegally. “Principals should let us know if they spot such illegal vehicles, we will ensure action is initiated,” said Pradeep Shinde, deputy commissioner, RTO.
