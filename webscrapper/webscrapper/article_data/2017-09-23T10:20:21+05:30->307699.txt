COIMBATORE: More than 100 people belonging to various dalit organisations   outside the district collector’s office on Friday alleging that around 4,000   of   belonging to them were illegally sold to private industries and companies in Coimbatore. 

 President of Samooga Neethi Katchi N Panneerselvam said as per the government order this land cannot be sold or pledged for at least 10 years. And after 10 years, if the land is sold, it can only be sold to dalits. “But as per the documents received by us under the Right To Information Act, we have come to know that nearly 12 lakh acres of panchami land were handed over in 1892 and of that only 2.5 lakh acre still belongs to dalits now,” said Panneerselvam. 
 
 In April 2017, a private college was sealed in Alandurai after it was found to be functioning on panchami land. “But the government is trying to take over even that land. It should be handed over to the dalit people,” said another protester. 
 
 They petitioned the national commission for scheduled castes at the district collector’s office and alleged that nearly 900 acres were available at   alone and many renowned industries had encroached upon the land. “Similarly, in Pollachi, Sulur, Annur and Madhukkarai, the government should take steps to retrieve the land,” said Panneerselvam. 
 
 The members of the national commission said that they were aware that 70% of dalit land was encroached in the state and that is why this survey had begun. “We will ensure that the land is retrieved,” said L Murugan, vice-chairman of the national commission for scheduled castes.
