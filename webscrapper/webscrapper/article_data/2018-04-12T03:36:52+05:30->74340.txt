Indrani told Chaudhry she was nauseous and wanted only fruits and juices. Indrani's advocate Sudeep Pasbola urged the court to allow them to access her medical reports. The court is yet to pronounce an order on the plea.
 
 Meanwhile, Peter a-nd Khanna were brought to court in the morning as Indrani's former assistant,  , was to take to the stand for the first time as the third prosecution witness in the case.
 
 During the lunch break, Khanna's lawyer Shreyansh Mithare requested they be permitted to have lunch. The court allowed them to have some sandwiches on condition they would be eaten inside the court room. Peter and Khanna have been in jail since their arrest for  's murder in 2015.
 
 In the past, the duo has been allowed to have food provided by relatives visiting them at the city civil and sessions court at Kala Ghoda where the trial in the 2012 murder case is currently underway. But with Indrani taking ill, authorities have decided to put restrictions on the duo's intake.
