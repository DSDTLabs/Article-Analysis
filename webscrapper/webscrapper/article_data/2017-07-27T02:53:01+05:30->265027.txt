NEW DELHI: A section of the tomato traders at   is persisting with its decision to go on a strike from Monday even as the government announced that there would be fresh allotment of tomato sheds.

 The city is facing an acute shortage of the vegetable, resulting in retail prices crossing Rs 100 per kg. Traders have warned of a further increase in price if their protests continue.
 
 Two sections of growers, each accusing the other of having occupied the sheds illegally, have been sitting on dharnas at the wholesale market for a week. The   (APMC) had issued a notice to one section on July 20, saying “it has come to our notice that the following firms have illegally put up their boards at some tomato sheds even as they have no permission from   Azadpur, nor has there been any change made by the Tomato Traders Association”. The notice gives them three days after its receipt to remove their boards.
 
 “If APMC has issued them notices for  , why is the government bent upon reallocation of sheds. We stand by our decision to go on a strike from Monday because we believe that vested interests have prevailed upon the government to take this decision,” said  , a trader.
 
 The notice issued by the government, after meetings with both sets of traders on Tuesday, says that fresh allotments of tomato sheds will be made on the basis of the market fee received from individual commission agents in the past three financial years — 2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. “This will be done on the pattern of allotment made for potato and onion trade,” said a senior government official.
