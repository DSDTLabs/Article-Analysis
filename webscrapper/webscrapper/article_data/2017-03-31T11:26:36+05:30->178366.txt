PATNA: The city seems to be going along with   Smriti Irani’s last year’s #IWearHandloom campaign. It can be gauged from the high demand for hand woven and handloom materials in an effort to look edgy. 

 “One just wants to wear breathable materials in summer months. Cotton or mul fabric maxi dresses, paired with canvas shoes and silver junk jewellery for a boho chic look, are finding many takers this season. Block prints and ‘kalamkari’ are also being well loved,” said designer Jayshree, who runs a boutique on Boring Road.
 
 “Georgette and chiffon have already been tried and tested previously and this time cotton is leading the fusion front,” she added.
 
 Floral motifs and stripes are always a big hit in summer months. Branded shops around the city seem to be overflowing with bright colourful shades along with ivory and pastel colours. 
 
 Shreya, a third year student of NIFT-Patna said brands have adopted   like khadi and cotton and fused them with western designs. In latest twist,  , warli art and prints have also made an appearance on Indo-western dresses. 
 
 Shreya said with summer shades of yellow are in,   has made a comeback. Dramatic sleeves are a thing this season. Gold and copper jewellery are out as youngsters are opting for silver jewellery this summer. Wedges and white shoes are a big hit, she added. 
 
 Hemlata Shekhawat, director of Srijani, an NGO associated with the production of handicrafts and handloom lifestyle products, said they are trying to help weavers, who were not getting much work with inception of power looms. “Perception is changing slowly. People are opting for skin-friendly materials like khadi or cotton. Over the years, the demand for handloom materials has increased. We expect the sales to go up this year as Patna is celebrating centenary of Champaran satyagrah which will have sentimental attachment towards khadi,” she added.
