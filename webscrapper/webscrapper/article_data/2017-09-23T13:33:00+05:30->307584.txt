CHANDIGARH: The process of the selection of the new director principal at the   ( ) 32 will soon be initiated after the recent communication between the   health department and the UPSC. The UT health department has sent the recommendations to the   for change in recruitment rules. 

 The UPSC has now conveyed to the UT health department to either reduce the tenure of the post of the director principal to three years if the maximum age for the eligibility is 59 or make it for 5 years if the maximum age for the eligibility is 57. The same will be soon deliberated by the UT health department. Sources inform that the maximum age will be 59 years and this will allow 8 senior doctors from the GMCH eligible for the post.
 
 After Dr   completed his tenure as the director principal on April 23, Dr   was given additional charge as the director principal. As he will retire by December end, the recruitment rules will soon be revised and applications will be advertised for the post. “We are examining all this and shall soon decide,” said Anurag Aggarwal, UT home-cum-health secretary. 
 
 “After the post is advertised by the UPSC, applicants are given 45 days to apply. So, the decision must be immediately taken by the UT on the upper age limit,” said a faculty member. 
 
 The GMCH had recommended for a maximum age limit of 54 years with tenure of five years instead of the present 55 years for tenure of three years. Also, the draft which was prepared in March had recommended that even after the director-principal completes his five-year term, he can be the head of the department until he turns 62, the age of retirement. 
 
 The UT administration had decided to draft the amended rules for the post after many senior faculty members at GMCH had sent their representation for changing the rules this January.
