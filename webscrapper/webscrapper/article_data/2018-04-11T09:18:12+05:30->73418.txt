CHENNAI: Despite the Madras high court directing the   (TNSCB) in 2017 to revoke allotment orders of owners found subletting or selling their allotted houses to third parties and to carry out inspections to end such malpractices, no efforts have been made till now.

 The practice still continues across sites where people are found leasing out their property . TNSCB has not begun inspections of sites.
 
 “Brokers roam around here day-in and day-out trying to get people to buy these houses. The guy who owns all these properties was a bigwig in   in   from where we all shifted here last year,” said S Ganga*.
 
 The person she referred to managed to get allotment orders for all the members of his family .
 
  “Officials should see that one family should get one allotment order, but I know many here who have at least five allotment orders. They don’t stay. They either sell or rent it,” said P Lakshmi* of  .
 
 In December 2017, HC directed TNSCB that if the allottees want to sell their house deed, it can be only done to the board. No other third party is allowed to occupy tenements allotted to them.
 
 A senior official from TNSCB involved in the resettlement drives said there is more what meets the eye. “Every official and the minister is aware of the practice. No one will take action fearing consequences on not appeasing the vote bank,” the official said.
 
 An official from the TNSCB, when contacted, agreed that inspection is essential to check such practices. “But as far as the board is concerned, no such steps have been taken,” the official stated.
