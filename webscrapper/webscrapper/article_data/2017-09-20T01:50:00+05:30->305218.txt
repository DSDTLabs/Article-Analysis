PATNA: A day after the government of India told the Supreme Court that the Rohingya population fleeing from Myanmar posed a threat to the national security, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said on Tuesday the Narendra Modi government should provide shelter to the refugees on “humanitarian ground”.   Speaking on the sidelines of party’s ‘Jan Aakrosh’ rally in Patna, Yechuri said the Modi government should take appropriate action against terror threat, if any, but the refugees should not be denied shelter.    He said India should also seek the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees)’s intervention to resolve the Rohingya crisis on the lines of its intervention in Afghanistan for over a decade.    The Centre through an affidavit has told the apex court that militant elements among the Rohingyas are active in Delhi, Hyderabad, Mewar and Jammu. There is an “organised network of touts” operating in Myanmar and West Bengal and Tripura to facilitate the illegal influx of Rohingyas into India, the affidavit said.    While Bihar’s ruling JD (U) has not taken a stand on the issue even as party president and CM Nitish Kumar has “personally favoured insaniyat’ (humanity)”, Yechuri slammed Nitish for allying with BJP.    “Didn’t Nitish know about the corruption charges against RJD chief Lalu Prasad when he tied up with him prior to the 2015 assembly election? If at all Nitish was uncomfortable in the company of tainted Lalu family, he should have gone for fresh election instead of joining hands with the saffron party after the election,” Yechuri said.    The CPM general secretary also berated the Nitish government for “poor” flood relief measures.    Speaking on the “poor economic situation”, Yechuri said the Modi government’s initiatives like demonetisation and GST have caused a severe jolt to the Indian economy.
