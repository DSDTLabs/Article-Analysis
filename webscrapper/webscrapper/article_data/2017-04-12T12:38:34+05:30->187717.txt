Many among us are more confident expressing ourselves over a text than a face-to-face conversation or through a call. Typing whatever is there on your mind and pressing the send button seems to have become the shortcut to an easier communication. Why are millennials shying away from talking over the phone? Why has the calling technology become almost obsolete or intrusive? What’s wrong with this epistemological shift?

 
 
 ”Texting allows for communication which is less spontaneous but more 'to the point', avoiding circumstantiality and allowing the person to convey what he/she wants without the fear of being criticized immediately, therefore, reducing the fear of social interaction,” says Dr.  , Senior Consultant, Psychiatry, Paras Hospitals, Gurugram.
 
 She adds, “There is slurring, stuttering or trembling in the speech of an anxious person. Writing allows one to rethink while reading what one has written. Socially conscious kids feel they will be able to convey the right thing if they texted rather than just spoke. It is also possible that talking face to face allows the other person to respond and react which may make the person trying to say something more anxious.“
 
 Here are a few scenarios in which it may be happening:
 - If one does not want to seem vulnerable. In such cases,   acts as a good cover.
 - In order to have a control over the conversation, one may opt for texting. Whether a person feels intimidated in the presence of another person or if he wants to intimidate the other person, preferring to text over talk can mean either of these.
  - To avoid other person’s heightened emotional state, such as his crying or anger, a person may not want to talk over the phone.
 - Or simply, one may prefer texting to expend lesser energy.
 
 
 
 The rise in texting has many critics. You must have lost the count of number of times when you wanted to convey a sarcastic remark in good humour but it came across as rude. The instances of misunderstandings over messaging are too frequent and too many and they are much beyond the ‘autocorrect fails’.
 
 Here’s a whopping fact: Only 7 per cent of human communication happens through the content of the message. The rest are body language (58 per cent) and vocal tone, pitch and emphasis (35 per cent). This was established by   professor  . So, when we are texting each other, we are using only 7 per cent of our total communication potential. This is the reason you may find, for instance, apologizing over a message easier than through talking or through a face-to-face conversation. Typing ‘sorry ‘ and hitting send is way more convenient as it doesn’t require you to convey an apologetic expression, body language, tone or pitch. The person at the receiving end is less likely to be convinced if the apology comes through a text for the same reason. He wants to see if you feel the apology, if your body language conveys it and if your expressions say it.
 
 There’s a common saying these days: ‘Face it, Not Facebook’. This is only because texting causes many problems for those dependent on it a little too much.
 
 
 
 However, there are many who believe that it shouldn’t be cut down altogether. Many a times, it also offers benefits, such as:
 - Saves your time
 - Helps you stay in touch with people more who you would otherwise not talk to
 - It is better for casual conversations, everyday banter, planning outings on chat groups, saying quick hellos and good byes.
 
 
 
 Look out for these signs to know if you are getting too much dependent on texting.
 - If there are critical issues than need talking out but you are avoiding to call
  - If you feel that you prefer to text over talk due to any underlying confidence issues
 - If you are getting too dependent on it for every kind of conversation
 - If you get panicky when the concerned person calls you
