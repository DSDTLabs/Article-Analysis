MYSURU: Bandh calls purportedly given at the behest of   CM Siddaramaiah on days when PM   and   chief   visit the pollbound state tell the story about the keen contest on the cards as the state goes to polls in a few months. 

 
 A bandh call was given by Vatal Nagaraj, chief of Kannada Chaluvali Vatal Paksha, over the Mahadayi water dispute between Goa and Karnataka, for Thursday, the day Shah addressed a rally in Mysuru on completion of the 75-day ‘Parivartan Yatra’ of ex-CM B S Yeddyurappa. Modi is slated to address a public rally in Bengaluru on February 4. 
 
 The bandh was initially called for January 27 but was advanced to January 25. Siddaramaiah was purportedly heard in a video asking Nagaraj to advance it to January 25 to coincide with Shah’s rally. Nagaraj and Siddaramaiah reportedly had a meeting four days ago. Since the bandh call was for 12 hours, BJP members alleged it was done to derail Shah’s rally. “There is no necessity for a Karnataka bandh. If there was a bandh in the affected area, it was fine. What has Mysuru got to do with the issue?” BJP state chief Yeddyurappa asked. He said the two bandhs were politically motivated. “The CM’s trying to create confusion, stop buses and close schools and colleges as has been done before. I have not heard of any CM behaving in this manner,” he said. 
 
 Karnataka Congress chief G Parmeshwara disputed the claim, saying the CM was busy preparing the budget and had no time for such issues. “BJP is known for the politics they are doing. They might have cooked up the video, which is not authentic as the CM can’t decide or suggest a bandh,” he said. Nagaraj didn’t respond to repeated phone calls. 
 
 The Mahadayi river water dispute has lingered for over three decades as Goa has not agreed to release water even as the two states had an agreement about watersharing for drinking and irrigation purposes.
