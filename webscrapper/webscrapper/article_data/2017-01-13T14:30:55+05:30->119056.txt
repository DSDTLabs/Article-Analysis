 I love listening to what people say. And when masters speak one must quietly listen because one gets to learn so much. Selvaganesh is one of the greatest kanjeera players and percussionists in our country and it’s been my honour to collaborate with the maestro for The Dewarists Season 5. After working with him I can say he is an equally amazing human being and a pleasure to work with. 
 
 
 
 Yes, I would love to change that this year, because it’s important to know what’s happening around you as far as music scene is concerned. But I find it very difficult to find that kind of time and space, because after working for hours on my own music I want to go home and just relax and not listen to more music. But I would like to change that this year.
 
  
 
 I still think that I am a part time singer. But yes, I am working on my singing a lot and wouldn’t want to disappoint my fans.
 
 
 
 I liked   from Sultan and Channa Mereya from Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.
 
  
 
 Lots and lots of Gujrati gaṛbas and Maraṭhi lok geet.
