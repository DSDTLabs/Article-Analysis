NEW DELHI:   eased to a five-month low in March on the back of cooling food prices, while industrial output growth remained robust in February, signalling a recovery. Data released by the   (CSO) on Thursday showed inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), rose an annual 4.3% in March, which was slower than previous month’s 4.4%. Inflation in the rural areas was 4.4%, while in urban areas it was 4.1%.

 
 The food price index slowed to 2.8% in March from February’s 3.3% as vegetable prices cooled. Prices of pulses contracted 13.4% during the month as well as sugar and confectionary by 1.6%.
 
 
  
 
 “As expected, cooling food prices dampened the headline CPI inflation to a five-month low of 4.3% in March 2018, bringing the average for the quarter in line with MPC’s (monetary policy committee’s) forecast of 4.5%. However, the core inflation rose to a 43-month high of 5.4% in March 2018, driven by miscellaneous items and pan, tobacco and intoxicants,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ratings agency  .
 
 
 Separate data showed industrial output growth remained steady in February, led by strong performances by the manufacturing and capital goods sectors. The index of industrial production rose an annual 7.1%, marginally slower than the previous month’s 7.4% “This is the first instance of four consecutive months of   growth of more than 7.1% in the 2011-12 base data,” said Devendra Pant and Sunil Sinha, economists at India Ratings and Research.
