 Cooper is directing the musical romantic drama remake of the 1937 film 'A Star Is Born', with Gaga in the lead role.
 
 According to a report, at a film festival panel with his   co-star  , Cooper opened up about the pact that he and Gaga made before the cameras started rolling. 
 
 "She said right from the beginning that this was going to be a bargain," Cooper said. 
 
 "'I'm gonna rely on you to get a performance that's honest out of me', because she'd never done a film before, and 'I'm gonna make sure you turn into a musician, because we're going to sing everything live'. 
 
 "And I thought, wait, what? She said, 'No, the only way this is going to work -- I can't stand when I watch movies when they have music and you can tell when it's pre-recorded and people are lip-syncing'. And she's right. 
 
 "So that was terrifying, but I really relied on her."
