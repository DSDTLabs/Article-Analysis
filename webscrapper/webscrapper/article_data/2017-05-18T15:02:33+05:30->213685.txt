KOLKATA: The CID on Wednesday filed a 30-page chargesheet against seven accused in the  , including former BJP youth leader Juhi Chowdhury, Chandana Chakraborty, who ran a home for children, and her brother  .

 The CID said a supplementary chargesheet was also expected against Chowdhury, but the defence said the case would not stand legal scrutiny, given not a single child could be recovered from the accused.
 
 “Chakraborty had turned to Chowdhury to procure documents and licence for her Bimala Sishu Griha. Despite being aware of the illegal adoption process being followed by the home, which did not have a license, Chowdhury lobbied for it. She even planned to take over the homes and open other such centres,” said an officer.
