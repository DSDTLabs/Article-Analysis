KOLKATA: It could be a big relief for   cement giant UltraTech in its effort to take over bankrupt Binani Cement as creditors may now consider an out-of-court settlement option put forward by Binani Industries. The   (NCLT) has suggested in an order that in the larger interest of all the stakeholders, possibility of having a harmonious settlement is to be considered. "Talk of settlement, if any, is at the liberty of the CoC (Committee of Creditors)," says the order.

 The creditors' panel has to get back to NCLT on April 9 with its opinion on offer. However, a source in   said it still believes that an out-of-court settlement is not under the purview of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. "DCB has already written to the creditors against the attempt of an outof-court settlement. Such thing will violate the binding agreement between CoC and DCB," a source close to the development added.
 
 According to the source, the final offer of Dalmia Cement, which was voted and approved by CoC is over Rs 6,900 crore - substantially higher than what was conceived as its offer of around Rs 6,400 crore. The offer was subsequently filed by Dalmia Cement's resolution professional (RP) to NCLT. The revised offer of Ultratech was of Rs 7,266 crore.
 
 Meanwhile, the creditors have argued that Binani Industries, the holding company of Binani Cement, has not submitted a detailed plan in this regard. But, Binani counsel   argued that a detailed plan will be submitted subsequently.
