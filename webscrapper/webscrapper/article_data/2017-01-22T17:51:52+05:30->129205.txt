TRICHY: Two bull tamers died and 129 others suffered injuries during a   event at Rapoosal village in  's Pudukkottai district on Sunday.

 The deceased have been identified as Raja, 26, and Mohan, 25, both of whom were from Rapoosal.
 
 Pudukkottai superintendent of police J Loganathan said Raja and Mohan sustained serious injuries when the bulls gored them. One of the victims suffered an injury on his stomach when he attempted to hold the bull by its hump, and the other's ribs were pierced when he tried to tame the bull.
 
 They were rushed to Pudukkottai Government Hospital after being given first aid, but they died later. As many as 30 of the injured were taken to Pudukkottai Government Hospital. 
 
 Others, who suffered minor injuries, were given first aid.
 
 The jallikattu event in Rapoosal was flagged off by health and family welfare minister C Vijaya Baskar. More than 5,000 people were present in the village to watch it.
 
 There were 174 bull tamers at the event, and a total of 210 bulls were let loose.
 
 Jallikattu was organised in Tamil Nadu on Sunday after a gap of three years. The state government on Saturday promulgated an ordinance to allow the conduct of the sport. 
 
 Jallikattu events were organised in a few villages in Trichy and Pudukottai districts.
 
 However, people in Alanganallur and a few other places foiled the state government's plan to hold jallikattu, as they wanted a permanent solution whereby the bull-taming sport can be held without any legal hindrances in future.
