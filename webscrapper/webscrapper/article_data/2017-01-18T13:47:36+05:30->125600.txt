For the upcoming   movie  , Marathi cinema’s angry young man –   will be romancing Durga Patil. 

  The  , which is based on the life of underworld don Chota Rajan, will have   play the eponymous role while Durga plays his love interest Rani. 
 
  The 19-year-old hottie is excited about essaying Rani. “When I auditioned, I did not expect that I will be selected from 230 girls for this particular role,” shares Durga. However, once she was selected, essaying the particular character was definitely not a cakewalk for her. “I had to put in a lot of hard work to portray Rani. Writer-director Bharat Sunanda wanted a fragile girl, but I am an athlete. I have played rugby on the national level. Naturally, my body language was more masculine. I had to work a lot to portray a delicate girl and it took me almost six months to get into the skin of Rani,” informs Durga. 
  
  The film explores the tragic love-story on the backdrop of some of the worst gang wars in the history of Mumbai. While Santosh and Durga will play the leads, talks are also on with Bollywood’s Dada – Jackie Shroff. Shroff is approached by Bharat to play the role of Dawood Ibrahim. We'll keep you posted on that front too.
