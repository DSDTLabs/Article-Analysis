 “We want to know what sort of chemical was used in the manufacturing of the spurious IMFL by the Ashok Marwadi who used to run the factory. If Marwadi was mixing methanol or ethanol with liquor to increase the quantity that it could be worrying factor for us as that could result in a hooch tragedy,” said a senior crime branch official.
 
 “Marwadi is on the run and teams have dispatched to nab him” said a senior crime branch official. 
 
 Police sources said since the prohibition laws were made more stringent bootleggers are finding it hard to smuggle liquor from other states and hence some of them have started manufacturing spurious liquor.
