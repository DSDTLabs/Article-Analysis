Mangaluru: The District Kambala Samiti is planning to provide health insurance for buffalo riders and buffaloes taking part in Kambala.

 There are about 140 buffalo riders who participate in 80 Kambala events organised at various places from Thalappady in Dakshina Kannada to Shirva in Udupi every year. Of these 140 riders, the Samiti plans to insure at least 60-70 riders this year.
 
 The Samiti plans to introduce the scheme with the Koti-Chennaya Jodukare Kambalain Moodbidri on November 11, which marks the beginning of this season.
 
 “Decisions on finalising the insurance company, the type of scheme and coverage amount will be taken at a meeting on Sunday, September 24,” said Samiti president Shantharama Shetty Barkur. “We plan to introduce a group insurance for Kambala riders. There are many riders, but only about 60-70 are actively involved, who will be covered. We are checking options through insurance companies to get the best group health insurance policy with less annual premium,” he added.
 
 He said the Samiti is looking at a comprehensive policy. “The riders should get medical benefits for all ailments and not just for injuries sustained during Kambala. We have sent letters to all the riders in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts requesting them to enrol themslves as members of the Samiti to avail of the benefit,” he added.
 
 Shetty said there is also a plan to cover buffaloes under insurance, but it will be taken in the next phase. 
 
 The Samiti is gearing up to launch the Kambala calendar for 2017-18 as the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Karnataka Amendment) Ordinance, 2017 has got the President’s approval. The state government had promulgated the ordinance in July.
