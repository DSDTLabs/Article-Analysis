GHAZIABAD: The   has withdrawn its decision to set up a   off CISF Road in Indirapuram following complaints that it’ll result in massive traffic jams in the area. The site, an 800-sq m   located near Shanti Gopal Hospital, will instead be used as a paid public  .

 Eight sites in the trans-Hindon area, including the plot off CISF Road in Indirapuram, had been identified by GDA in March to set up vending zones to rehabilitate street vendors and hawkers displaced in anti-encroachment drives. The Federation of Apartment Owners’ Association wrote to the GDA on April 16 urging it not to set up a vending zone over the 800-sq m plot fearing traffic jams. The matter was highlighted in TOI on April 17.
 
 “This plot was inspected by a committee headed by GDA secretary Santosh Rai. The committee found the plot unfit to set up a vending zone. The plot is a parking zone as per the master plan but was being illegally used by nearby institutions. Now, possession of the plot has been taken over by GDA and a bid has been invited to select a contractor to run it as a paid parking area,” GDA vice-chairperson Ritu Maheshwari told TOI.
 
 The GDA has also installed a ‘parking’ notice board at the entrance to the plot. According to the federation, the GDA had decided in the past to set up an underground Ganga water reservoir and a sewage pumping station underneath the plot.
