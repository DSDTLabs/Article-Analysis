While everyone was still getting over the Big Fat 
  wedding hangover, the just-married blushing bride   dashed off to   for her annual appearance. She made heads turn on the red carpet with her stunning styles, and hands adorned with mehendi, a rare sight at the film festival hosted at the French Riviera. “People there love it, for them it is exotic and they refer to it as henna. I really loved flaunting it with my outfits,” said Sonam, talking about her Cannes experience. Back on home turf, the actress is caught up in a whirlwind of promotions for her upcoming film, ‘Veere Di Wedding’. Everyone has been curious to know if the newly-weds will be moving to Delhi, or will the couple move into their plush apartment at Bandra Kurla Complex. When BT caught up with Sonam, she revealed, “Right now, I’m staying at my parents’ place in Juhu. I am doing up our house in BKC, but it will take us at least a year to get it done. In the interim, we are also looking to rent a place, but we haven’t found anything yet. I would love to live somewhere around Juhu, it’s more convenient. We also considered buying a place, but it doesn’t make sense to spend so much on a new house if we are planning to move into the BKC apartment after a year.” 

 After a full day of interviews, the actress who was heading straight to the airport to receive her hubby 
 , who was returning from London, added, “Both of us love London and we have invested in a place there, too. It’s a two-bedroom house and something we’re very proud of.” She’s a tad physically exhausted with all the celebrations, travel and promotions, but excited about her new beginnings. “I have not got a breather since the wedding, and I can take a break only after the release of my film,” she signs off.
