VISAKHAPATNAM: Vizagites woke up to unusual weather on Friday. A thick layer of freezing   was formed all over the city which in turn affected the visibility range by approximately 30 meters.

 The foggy conditions prevailed in the city till 8 am.
 
 Residents welcomed the change in weather as it coincided with Holi. The city came out on to the streets to celebrate the festival.
 
 Locals said the dense fog cover in the city gave them a Lammasingi-like experience.
 
 An official from the Indian Meteorological Department’s Vizag division said, “The fog is nothing unusual. It’s just part of the seasonal change as winter has come to an end and summer is about to begin. Such phenomenon takes place every year during this time.” 
 
 “There are various reasons for the fog. It occurs when the winds from the East carry water droplets inland. Due to the low inland temperature, the dew content in the air increases which leads to foggy conditions,” the official said.
