Rajkot: Investigation into the   of the 70-year-old retired schoolteacher in Master Society has indicated that she might have been killed for property. 

 The probe so far has revealed that victim Jayshree Shukla’s house is worth nearly 1.5 crore. Police also recovered some property-related papers that were forged. It is suspected that some professional gang was hired to forge the property documents and then eliminate the old woman, who was living alone for the last 30 years in the same house in   area.
 
  police inspector   said, “We suspect some property related issue as the motive behind the murder. Some of her relatives who were probably eyeing the property may have killed her.” Some neighbours also told police that Shukla’s mental condition was not very stable and sometimes she used to set ablaze the currency notes she received as pension.
 
 Shukla’s decomposed body was found on Thursday after neighbours complained of stench emanating from the house. Her throat was slit with a knife. 
 
 Police have already ruled out loot as the murder motive as no valuables were missing from her house.
 
 Shukla’s mother   had made a will to hand over this property to her in 1986 and there was a dispute in the family since then. Police has so far recorded the statements of nearly 20 relatives of Shukla and everybody is under suspicion.
