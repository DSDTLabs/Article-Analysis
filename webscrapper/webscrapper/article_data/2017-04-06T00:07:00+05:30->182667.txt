Indore: After light and sound show, people can get glimpse of ancient history and culture of Indore and Malwa region on small screens, which will be installed at proposed art centre in historic   monument. 

 Indore development authority (IDA) is planning to install more than 40 electronic display screens in the hall. 
 
 Officials of the development authority said that they would spend around Rs 10 lakh on the project. “The idea behind installing the screens is to come up with interactive stories that can engage audience,” said IDA chairman Shankar Lalwani. 
 
 Lalwani said that while they will install the screens, the district administration would decide about content to be displayed on them.
 
 This is not the first time that the development body has come up with an idea. More than a year ago the development body had come up with a similar plan. However, it could not be implemented as a part of the building fell in July last year. 
 
 Officials said they have prepared the new plan keeping sensitive condition of the building. Officials said that installation of screens will not harm the building. 
 
 “The screens will be placed away from walls, an artificial wall of ply would be created, two rods from both sides will hold a screen, we will not harm the walls of the structure in any manner,” said Lalwani. 
 
 Officials of the civic body also said that hall, where the art gallery has been proposed has not been affected by the structure that fell a year ago. 
 
 A sound and light show is already run at the historic building every day. After a part of the building fell, an enquiry was conducted to study the effect of vibrations on the building.
 
 While the officials claimed that vibrations had not affected the building, it was later decided that sound boxes would be placed away from the walls. Several other development activities have also been proposed at Rajwada.
