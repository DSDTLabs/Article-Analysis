  ‘Officer’ that also stars   is touted to be the story of ‘scary cop’ played by Nagarjuna. Going by the teaser, it looks like he is appointed on board the SIT to investigate a rogue cop named Pasari.

There also seems to be a girl child involved in the story, seemingly his daughter, with Nagarjuna’s character doing his best to protect her. 
 
  The one minute teaser reveals nothing much of the story but sure reveals that this will be a typical RGV out and out action fare. However, we will have to wait and see if RGV and Nagarjuna recreate their magic with this one.
