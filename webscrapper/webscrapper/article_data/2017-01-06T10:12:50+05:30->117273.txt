NEW DELHI:   has taken everyone by surprise with his sudden decision to step down as captain of India's limited-overs team. In doing so, he has also announced the last lap of his career. Although Dhoni has said he is available for selection as a player, by the time the dust settles on the announcement the process of finding a suitable successor could be well under way.

 According to the selectors, the process, in essence, will start with the two warm-up matches between India 'A' and England at the Brabourne stadium in Mumbai on Jan 10 and 12. TOI has learnt that managing and tracking Dhoni's form has become a tricky issue for the selectors. The three ODIs against England will be India's last before the Champions Trophy in June. Dhoni has had very little game time since the ODI series against New Zealand at home in October and the selectors could be tempted to play him in these warm-up games.
 
 However, looking ahead too is an important part of the selectors' game plan. "This is an emotional time for Dhoni. There is a process but for now there are many talented domestic players who have done well in domestic cricket. It is important to reward them as well," chairman of selectors   told TOI on Thursday.
 
 "You never know, one match can turn a career around. Even   came up playing such a match against England. So, it's important to try out the performers in the domestic circuit," Prasad said while adding, "Only the senior players who are coming back from injuries will be playing in the warm-up games. As for Dhoni, we have a long IPL season before the Champions Trophy. Captaincy has nothing to do with his ability with the bat."
 
 Prasad, however, was satisfied with how Dhoni decided to step down. "This is a well-communicated decision. Nobody can doubt Mahi's integrity and whatever he does is in the best interest of the country and the team. This is the right time for Virat (Kohli) to take over," he reckoned.
