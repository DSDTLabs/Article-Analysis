Bharuch:  ,   

 “I feel that the real benefits of schemes and reservation for tribal is being misused by others. On Thursday, I wrote a letter to the chief minister over rabari, bharwad, charan and siddi Muslims given quota under scheduled tribe category,” Vasava told TOI.
 
 “Recently, 68 persons were recruited in state government on vacancies reserved for tribals, of which 35 are of rabari, bharwad, charan and siddi Muslim community. This is just tip of the iceburg, I am collecting data of other recruitment in last few years. I have urged for cancellation of all such appointments,” Vasava said. 
 
 “To fight this injustice, I have decided to launch a non-political platform ‘Adivasi Dalit Baxipanch Adhikar Manch’ on Dussehra (September 30). I have invited key leaders from Bharuch and Narmada districts and few from other parts of Gujarat to announce the manch formally,” he said.
 
 The main issues to be discussed include water crises for irrigation in tribal villages, especially in a command area of Narmada and Karjan, poor infrastructure and lack of quality education & health facilities for tribals and issues pertaining to violation of tribal rights.
 
 When asked if this move will upset the BJP leadership, Vasava said, “I am not going out of BJP’s fundamental ideology. Whatever I have done is with honesty. If someone take otherwise what I can do?”
 
 Vasava is a five time MP since 1998 and was made as Union minister of state for tribal affairs in BJP government in 2014. He was later dropped in 2016.
