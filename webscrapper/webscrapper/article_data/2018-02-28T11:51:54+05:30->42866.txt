MYSURU: Youngsters need to imbibe Mahatma Gandhi’s principles on generating employment in villages and the importance of rural economy, said chairman of the   and   (KVIC) Vinai Kumar Saxena on Tuesday.

 Saxena was in the city to inaugurate the Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan, the flagship store of Khadi Ayog, on Kantharaj Urs Road near Ballal Circle.
 
 Saxena said the   Narendra Modi had assured the Khadi Ayog of financial support. “Employment in rural India will increase because of this venture,” said Saxena.
 
 As part of its efforts to compete with the giants in the e-commerce sector, Saxena said that KVIC would also launch an e-commerce website.
 
 “We will set up around 100 stores in airports across the country. Currently, we have around four stores in airports,” Saxena said, adding that a   would be set up at the cost of nearly Rs 4.2 crore at Vijayanagar III Stage.
 
 “A Khadi plaza will be set up in Belagavi and Bengaluru to market Khadi products throughout the year,” he said.
 
 Pointing to the first ever Khadi fashion show that was held in Chikkaballapur, Saxena said, “We have to be on a par with global brands when it comes to marketing. A Common Facility Centre will be set up in Chikkaballapur to encourage Khadi products in the country.”
 
 On the KVIC’s ambitious ‘Honey Mission’, Saxena said, “In keeping with PM Modi’s call for a ‘Sweet Revolution’ in India, we are encouraging apiaries to boost honey production. While 2,600 boxes have been distributed across the country, our target is to distribute seven lakh boxes by March 31.”
 
 The BJP-led NDA government was committed to promoting the ideals of Gandhi, Saxena said. “In 10 years, the UPA distributed only six charakas, while the NDA has distributed 7,000 only in the past two years,” Saxena added.
 
 “Karnataka has the highest number of Khadi institutions in the country at 42,” Saxena said.
