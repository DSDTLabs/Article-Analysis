BENGALURU: While suspended police inspector Vijay Hadagalli faces departmental action for delaying the filing of an FIR against MLA N A Haris son   in the cafe assault case, the spotlight is once again on police transfers and political intervention.

 Senior ministers said the cabinet rejected amendments to increase the minimum tenure for a police officer from one year to two years. Hadagalli, facing a departmental inquiry for the second time in the past four years, was transferred thrice in the same constituency of Shantinagar.
 
 “How is that possible without political influence? Now, in several other cases where honest police officers have to function, if there is no stability in police transfers, how do you expect them to stand up to their political bosses?”   opposition leader Jagadish Shettar had asked in the session.
 
 Asked about it, home minister   told TOI: “While he was in  , a departmental inquiry was conducted against the inspector. Only after it was completed, he was transferred to Ashoknagar. I don’t know if there was political interference in his transfers and retained in the same constituency. At times, local MLAs make unofficial requests for transferring or retaining a particular officer.”
 
 To curb such untimely transfers, Reddy had, on the floor of the house, earlier said the government will amend the police transfer period and increase it from a minimum of one year to two years.
 
 But on Wednesday, senior cabinet members said the proposal was shot down by   ministers with only Reddy and another minister supporting it.
 
 “When we proposed the amendment to ensure that police officers are not transferred on an ad-hoc basis and stay in one station for a longer period of time, no one in the cabinet agreed to it. There was an urgent need to bring about transparency in the transfer of police officers. But, except for the home minister and a couple of others, no one in the cabinet agreed to it,” a minister said.
