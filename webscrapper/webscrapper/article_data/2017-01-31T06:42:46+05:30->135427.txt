KOLKATA: Days after top   expressed their satisfaction at how the first phase of the  ,   has succeeded in cutting down   and  , they have now instructed all 25 traffic guards to ensure bikers wear the right helmet in the right manner.

 “Wearing a correct helmet in a correct manner is one of the first steps a rider can take to ensure personal safety . We are launching phase-II of our campaign with this motto on our mind,“ said an IPS officer.
 
 Cops say certain facts and figures they have collected last year have been an eye-opener.In 2016, between July 8 and December 31 (the time from which the campaign was launched) the city witnessed 55 fatal bike accidents. In 2015, in the same time-frame, the city had witnessed as many as 72 deaths. Just 32 riders who did wear helmets died in this period in 2016 compared to a high of 61 in 2015. Yet, while only 11 persons with helmets on died in 2015 (July 8-December 31), as many as 23 died in 2016 even after wearing helmets.
 
 Police sources insist many who are now being forced to wear helmets are not investing in the right gear just to save a few bucks. Worse, there are others who do not even strap their helmets. “We have advertised extensively and released teasers. We have even roped in schools. On the other hand, we have done extensive crackdowns. At present, we are mulling if we can have a certain provision under the Motor Vehicles Act to take care of this problem,“ said an officer at Lalbazar. “Bikers should know what exactly they need to buy .It's a necessary measure to keep yourself safe,“ said DC (traffic) Solomon V Neshakumar.
 
 A road, transport and highways ministry official admitted though there is a `helmet action committee' at the Centre, little has been done so far.
