 ran short of time and missed questions in her board examination due to a hand injury but managed to   95%. The left-handed class X student in   met with an accident just before her pre-board examination and suffered an injury on the same hand. The doctor advised her to give it rest as she had suffered a double fracture on the wrist and arm. However, a month later, the diagnosis was found to be incorrect. She had suffered a ligament tear which led to a persistent pain.

 “Due to the wrong diagnosis, I had to go through unbearable pain from pre-boards till the board examination,” said Vidhi.
 
 In her pre-board exams, she got help from the school as writers were given to her. However, in the board examination, she had to write herself as the permission to get a writer took time. “I practised writing with my right hand but my speed was too low and I ran short of time to complete exams. But I am happy that despite not being able to give my 100%, I scored well,” said Vidhi.
