JAIPUR: The probe into the death of 18-year-old   who hanged herself in the hostel room of   on March 23 has not reached any conclusion so far. The cops have not found any   in the allegations made by the parents of the deceased.

 An official who is a part of the probe told TOI that no proof of any harassment has been found in the   investigation yet. “We have recorded the statements of hostel inmates who told us that Komal was under depression as she had flunked in her papers and she was initially also planning to skip one of her papers,” cops said, adding that nothing suspicious was found in her call detail records (CDR).
 
 Komal, a first-year BA English student, who had gone for a morning walk at Central Park, was found hanging after she returned to her room at 9 am on March 23. Later, her parents filed an FIR against college administration alleging their daughter was harassed to consume liquor and mentally tortured by seniors.
 
 However, the investigation by police and Rajasthan Women Commission (SWC) did not fetch any details about the involvement of any other person. “She took the extreme step because of her own problems, our investigation is still on but we haven’t found any clue of Komal being harassed or forced to take the step,” the police official said.
 
 Police are now banking on a torn page that was recovered from Komal's register which cops suspect to be a suicide note. The page starts with ‘I am Komal Prajapat’ but cannot be read fully as it's torn from several places. The page has been sent to forensic science laboratory (FSL) for impression. The FSL report is expected to arrive this week.
