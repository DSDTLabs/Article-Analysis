BENGALURU: The arrest of   in Madanapalle town, for attacking a woman in a   three years ago, was possible because of a general alert against Maoists in   and Telangana. 

 " According to intelligence inputs, men and women aged between 20 and 40 were active in a few towns, seeking financial support for their comrades in forests. A policeman, who was on patrol in Madanapalle, came across Madhukar Reddy in front of a jewellery shop and detained him for his suspicious behavior," a source privy to the development said. 
 
 Reddy was detained on January 28 and brought to Madanapalle police station, where police had no clue that the man in their custody was indeed the ATM attacker. "Initially, police thought he was a roadside mugger or thief. His contradictory statements prompted police to take him to his house for further interrogation. At Reddy's house, police recovered many old mobile phones, toy pistols, debit cards, and a card swiping machine he had robbed from a petrol bunk employee," the source said. 
 
 The police then realized that they were on to something big. "A special anti-Maoist squad from Chittoor was intimated about Reddy and the squad asked for his picture as well as fingerprints," the source said.
 
 Reddy's picture and fingerprints were sent to the AP statistics department, whose analysis revealed that the arrested man was a convict on the run and accused in a murder and four attempt-to-murder cases.
 
 "Reddy, meanwhile, was immediately arrested as a fugitive murder convict. Reddy's ATM attack link came to light when he confessed to it during interrogation," the source said.
