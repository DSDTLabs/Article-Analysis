KOLHAPUR: Shedding light on the incident which took place on Wednesday where a class V student was forced to skip classes as the parents failed to pay the fees on time has posed a serious concern on improper communication between the school authorities and the parents.

 Therefore, following   (Regulation of collection of fee) Act, 2011, which was later implemented in March 2014, all private unaided schools must set up Parent-Teacher association ( ) to look after proper communication between the school authorities and the parents.
 
 An educational official of   municipal corporation ( ) said, “PTA is a mandatory norm for the private unaided schools and this must function across schools in the city.”
 
 Education officer, district education department,   said, “All private unaided schools must set up the PTA executive committee within a month of their new academic session.”
 
 Chougule was speaking on the backdrop of the recent incident where a student was forced to skip classes as the parents were unable to pay the school fees on time.
 
 He added, “According to this act, parents of all the students admitted in the school automatically become members of its PTA. Under PTA, an executive committee has to be formed, comprising a chairperson, vice-chairperson, secretary, two joint-secretaries and members. The members include one parent and one teacher from every standard. We will also be monitoring the PTA activities across various schools at periodical intervals.”
 
 Chougale focused that proper communication is the key to avoid such issues in the future.
