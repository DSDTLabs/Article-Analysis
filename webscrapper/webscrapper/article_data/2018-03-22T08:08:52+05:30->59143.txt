HYDERABAD: The UGC’s move to grant full autonomy to three universities has failed to amuse students and faculty members who fear that the status might not only push the existing facilities southwards, but also prove to be a step towards   — in case the state government gets involved in the varsities’ activities.

 Hoping that the managements do not start running the universities for profit, they urged the authorities to ensure that these institutes are still within the reach of economically backward classes.
 
 “While academic and administrative autonomy is welcome, financial autonomy might mean that the universities increase the fee at whim and start more self-financing courses to become self-sustained. Indirectly, this might mean inching towards privatisation,” said K  , professor, UoH. He also questioned the universities’ need to recruit foreign faculty, when the unemployment rate in the country is alarmingly high, and said that the move will give rise to different in salary structures within varsities, which will adversely impact local professors.
 
 One section of the faculty, however, hoped that universities would recruit foreign faculty only for certain courses that do not have adequate local talent.
 
 The apprehensions of students were rooted in welfare of those studying in these universities, which they insisted must not be ignored. “When a varsity is given full freedom, there is a chance the state gets involved in its functioning. This should be avoided. Authorities should make welfare of students their priority,” said P  , a student of OU. Students also hoped that universities have the freedom to start new courses as per industry demands.
