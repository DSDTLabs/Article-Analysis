RAJKOT: A 38-year-old   allegedly tried to commit suicide by consuming some poisonous tablets in Race Course on Tuesday. 

 Sachin Gondaliya, who works as a commission agent in import-export business, called up his friend and told him that he was taking the extreme step. His friend immediately called up 108 emergency service and   was shifted to the civil hospital. He, however, refused to lodge a complaint with the police.
 
 “We went to meet him twice. The second time after messages started doing rounds on Whatsapp that he tried to end life due to harassment by moneylenders. He refused to name anyone or lodge a complaint,” police sub-inspector of Pradhyumnagar police station said.
 
 Gondaliya had borrowed nearly Rs 15 lakh from friends, relatives and some moneylenders at an interest rate of 3% to 5%. However, his cash got stuck and he wasn't receiving any payment. As a result, he was unable to pay the interest to the lenders.
