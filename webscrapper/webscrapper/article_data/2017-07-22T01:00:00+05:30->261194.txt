 Funk Wav Bounces

   
 
 
 Calvin Harris is arguably one of the biggest names in the music world today. How else then, would the 33-year-old Scottish DJ be able to convince  ,  , Pharrell Williams, Ariana Grande and   among others, to collaborate on one album. But what remains to be seen is, does having so many marquee artistes in one album work out well? Is it just a gimmick, or do they collaborate with Harris and create music that can stand out, independently? It’s a yes on all counts. In his fifth album, Harris has settled in on a lazy, disco sound with songs that are all about having a good time, and barring one, the album doesn’t take itself seriously at all.
 
 Starting with Frank Ocean’s 'Slide', a superbly produced track, which takes on infidelity and one-night stands in a frank manner. Kudos to Ocean for the tight writing and Harris for a unique chorus. 'Heartstroke', with Young Thug and Ariana Grande is an up-beat hip-hop track, all about low-key, continuous chilling with a very beach-party vibe to it. Even though Pharrell Williams is just on the chorus, he’s still very much a part of the song. 'Feels', with Katy Perry and Williams again, encapsulates the feel of the album. With addictive snares and an 80’s feels, Perry is better on this than she has been on her own album. Snoop Dogg and John Legend rapping on 'Holiday', is another breezy rap you can head bob to.
