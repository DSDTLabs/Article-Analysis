NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday sought an action taken report (ATR) from police on a   leader's plea for lodging a sedition case against suspended   leader   for hosting Pakistani officials that allegedly posed a threat to national security. 

  Metropolitan Magistrate Manika directed petitioner Ajay Agrawal, a lawyer, who also sought FIR against Aiyar for allegedly uttering "derogatory" words against the Prime Minister, to supply copies of the documents in court based on which the police would file an ATR by April 7, the next date of hearing. 
 
  The court rejected the prayer of the complainant, who wanted the next date of hearing to be advanced on the ground that the matter was "sensitive". 
 
  Agrawal later told reporters he would approach the high court for a "speedy hearing in the matter as it was about the security of the country." 
 
 In his plea, Agrawal claimed that "derogatory" words were used against PM Modi at the meeting held on December 6 at Aiyar's residence, which was also attended by former PM   and ex-vice president  . PTI
