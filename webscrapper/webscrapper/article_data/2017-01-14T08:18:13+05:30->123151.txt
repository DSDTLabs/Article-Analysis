MUMBAI: A week after the shahi imam of the Tipu Sultan Mosque in Kolkata, Maulana Nurur Rehman Barkati, issued a fatwa against Prime Minister  , the controversial cleric faces a fatwa from a city mufti. In his fatwa, Mufti   has not only dismissed Barkati's "fatwa" against Modi as an outrageous and condemnable political statement, he has also questioned the controversial imam's credentials to lead namaz or prayers. 

 Misbahi is the chief mufti of   Ali Hasan Ahle Sunnat in  . His fatwa, originally in Urdu, stated: "Such statement cannot be called a fatwa at all since the statement poses danger to the peace of society. This is his personal and political statement and Shariah doesn't back such statements. ...Such a person cannot be an imam." 
 
 Misbahi said Barkati is not a mufti - one who has been trained in ifta, or a course in fatwa - and should not devalue the sanctity of the fatwa by passing off his political statements as fatwas.
 
 Last week Barkati outraged many when he issued a fatwa offering a Rs 25 lakh reward to anyone who "cuts off PM Narendra Modi's beard, shave his head and smear him with black ink". The meeting where he issued the fatwa was chaired by   MP Idris Ali, at the Kolkata Press Club.
 
 Misbahi also slammed Barkati for "embarrassing" Muslims by leading the namaz-e-janaza in absentia of the liquidated al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden on May 6, 2011. "Laden was a known terrorist and a confirmed terrorist cannot be a Muslim. So he didn't deserve an Islamic funeral prayer. Yet Barkati led a prayer, creating schism among Muslims and bringing a bad name to the community. Muslims should stop offering namaz in his leadership," he said on Friday.
 
 Misbahi is the same cleric whose 2015 fatwa against ISIS, at the initiation of city activist Dr A R Anjaria, was endorsed by over 1,000 Indian imams and clerics. Misbahi had also issued a fatwa against the oppression of minorities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Myanmar.
