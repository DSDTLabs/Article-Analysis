PUNE: Nineteen men were   for allegedly fabricating fitness certificates of heavy vehicles without the concerned Regional Transport Office ( ) conducting their inspection. 

 A fitness certificate is allotted to a vehicle after the RTO officials inspect it. They check if the vehicle is fit to be driven on the road or not and if it isn’t then it is of risk to other drivers and pedestrians. 
 
 Around 36 vehicles including trucks and buses without proper fitness certificates are plying on the city and district roads. 
 
 The police said the crime took place some time in between December 2017 and April 12 this year. According to the complaint lodged by senior RTO clerk Sanjay Gaikwad, the 36 vehicles are registered with the RTO, Pune. However the fitness certificates submitted are of Jalna RTO. When the Pune RTO officials consulted with the Jalna office, it was revealed that they never issued fitness certificates to these vehicles. 
 
 Sub-inspector Sandip Jamdade of Bund Garden police station said, “A vehicle’s fitness certificate can be obtained from any RTO it goes to. In this case, all the certificates were obtained from the Jalna RTO which has not issued any of the certificates.” 
 
 “The suspects attempted to save the mandatory fees of Rs800 per vehicle. A genuine certificate has a validity of a year. They prepared fake certificates and submitted it to the RTO,” Jamdade said. 
 
 “However, the vehicles’ registration numbers are with the RTO officials and they will be tracked down soon,” Jamdade said.
