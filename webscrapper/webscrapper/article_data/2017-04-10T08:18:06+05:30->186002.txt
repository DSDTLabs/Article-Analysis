NEW DELHI: Bihar chief minister   on Sunday advised his Delhi counterpart   to ban liquor in the interest of people. Citing the “success” of  , Kumar claimed that it has transformed the society and improved people’s lives in the state.

 “If you want to see it, you should come to Bihar,” Kumar said while addressing a rally in Badarpur for his party’s municipal poll candidate.
 
 He said that the Supreme Court order to remove liquor shops from highways should be implemented in letter and spirit. “Liquor shops are being taken inside towns from the highways after the SC order. It should be opposed,” he said, advocating liquor ban across the country. Kumar added that drinking is not a fundamental right and the campaign to ban liquor is connected with the well-being of families.
 
 Sunday was the second day of Kumar’s campaign for the civic polls. Talking about the Poorvanchali population in Delhi, he said, “They should not be called migrants. They have been living in Delhi for a long time; some have spent generations here. They are now like natives of Delhi.”
 
 Coming across an open drain during his roadshow, the Bihar CM said, “The civic infrastructure is in a mess. This drain on the main road is overflowing, but nobody has fixed it. What kind of Delhi is this? Smart cities are getting the push. The entire national capital should be a smart city.”
 
 Taking a dig at both PM Narendra Modi and Kejriwal, he said he works without advertisements and has never publicised his achievements. Kumar didn’t speak anything against Congress as the party is an ally in the Bihar government. Kumar also batted for regularisation of the 1600-off unauthorised colonies.
 
 Meanwhile, some JD(U) workers reported that their pockets had been picked. “Some people reported this to senior functionaries,” a party member said. However, no complaint for pickpocketing was lodged with the police.
