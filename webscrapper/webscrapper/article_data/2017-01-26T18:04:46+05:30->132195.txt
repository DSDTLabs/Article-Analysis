JAIPUR: In a letter to Chhattisgarh CM   on the eve of Republic Day,   and academic   appealed that the rule of law be upheld; that independent observers and researchers be allowed unrestricted access to the Bastar region of the state, which has been roiled by Naxalite violence; that the state not support or sponsor private groups that intimidate scholars, journalists or activists, and that strict punishment be meted out to those found guilty of such intimidation.

 On January 23, a mob of about 30 people threatened to set Bhatia's rented home on fire and kill her pet dog. The mob extracted a promise (in writing) that she would shift out of her home in Parpa village, Jagdalpur, in 24 hours. She has since made it clear that although she would shift home, she intends to continue to live and work in the area.
 
 The attack on Bhatia came days after she accompanied a team from the National Human Rights Commission that was recording statements of survivors of rape or sexual violence who filed FIRs against police personnel.
 
 On Republic Day, Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sanghatan issued a statement condemning the attack and calling upon the government to uphold Constitutional promises.
 
 “Clearly, this middle of the night attack is aimed at making Bela abandon her human rights work in the area and quit Parpa. Many other journalists, lawyers and activists who have dared to highlight the issue of state’s excesses have similarly been forced out of the district. Malicious violence and acts threatening life and liberty have been carried out by an out of order executive, with the active assistance of state sanctioned private militias. This has led to a complete ceassation of the activities of civil society,” the statement said, adding that the government should take responsibility for upholding the fundamental right of the academic to reside in a place of her choice and discharge her professional commitments without fear.
