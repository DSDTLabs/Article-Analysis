LUCKNOW: With just six days left for the release of controversial film Padmaavat, organisations demanding its ban now warn of a "reaction" if it is released in UP. 

 General Secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Kshatriya Mahasabha, Kunwar Harivansh Singh, who is also sitting   MP from Apna Dal, an alliance partner of ruling BJP, said that "Kshatriya youths are very upset over the film's release" and he fears that they may target theatres screening it.
 
 "Kshatriya youths have grown up hearing tales of   and this film is an assault on their culture. They are not under our control at this point and have threatened violence if the film sees the light of the day," he said. Kshatriya Mahasabha also decided to file a petition in   on Tuesday to stop the film's release.
 
 Shree Rajput  , which had protested against the release of Jodha Akbar earlier and had resorted to violence, said it would call for public boycott if Padmaavat is released. The organization has fixed an appointment with chief minister   on January 22 and is trying to meet Prime Minister  .
 
 Himanshu Singh, a Karni Sena patron, said, "We are taking a legal route to resolve this issue. But people's court is bigger than any other court and one must remember that there have been instances when SC orders have been revised. If the film's release still goes ahead, we will call for a public boycott of theatres and will request theatre owners not to show the film."
