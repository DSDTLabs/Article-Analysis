When producer and politico Munirathna announced his next project, the scale had everyone take note. The film, a retelling of the Mahabharata from Duryodhana’s perspective, called Kurukshetra, is not only a magnum opus, but also boasts some big names on its cast. Directed by  , the man behind one of Kannada cinema’s biggest historicals, Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna, shooting for   began in August last year. In the time since, not much has been heard about the progress of the project.
But with the state elections on the horizon, the buzz in the industry has been that the film has been delayed because of Munirathna’s political commitments. The fact, though, says Naganna, is that Kurukshetra is as good as complete, with only a few ‘patchwork’ scenes to be canned. “We have finished dubbing, as well as most of the computer graphic work. Composer V Harikrishna is giving finishing touches to the music, which should be released by the end of the month. Despite his busy schedule, Munirathna has been a very hands-on producer, making sure that he knows to what ends his money is being used,” explains Naganna. 
 Vinayaka R Hegde, spokesperson for Munirathna, adds, “Munirathna has multiple commitments. He is busy with the upcoming election, but as soon as it is over, his aim will be to release Kurukshetra at the earliest.”
