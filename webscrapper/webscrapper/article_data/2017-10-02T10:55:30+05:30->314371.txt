PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Former state deputy chief minister   has demanded the Swargate-Pimpri metro line be extended to accomodate the  , within the project’s first phase of works. 

 Pawar made his demands on Friday while addressing the press following a two-hour meet with city civic officials, including municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar, to discuss ongoing civic projects and problems. 
 
 “Pune and   both need the Nigdi-Katraj route completed as part of the metro’s first phase. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had performed the ground-breaking ceremony of the Pune metro project. So, there was no need for another ground-breaking ceremony for the metro’s Ramwadi-Vanaz route in Pune on Friday,” he said. 
 
 Pawar was referring to a ceremony performed last week that was attended by the several city officials, including mayor Mukta Tilak. 
 
 He alleged that delays in works were causing project costs to increase. “This will result in an increasing in ticket charges too. The Nagpur Metro is set to start soon but the Pune Metro rail is still a work in progress,” he said.
 
 Pawar also made comments on Pune’s law and order situation saying criminals were operating without fear of the law. “CCTVs have been installed across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad to increase public safety. But some cameras are not working. Criminals are not scared of the police and crimes such as kidnapping continue,” he said. 
 
 Pawar claimed that Hardikar promised to keep the CCTV network in Pimpri operational.
 
 The minister also blamed the ruling party for a host of problems. “The common man is suffering due to rising inflations; petrol is costliest in Maharashtra; rains have created in potholes in roads and teachers and Anganwadi workers are protesting,” he said. 
 
 He said he would soon bring up what he believed were problems facing Pimpri Chinchwad city during question-answer sessions in the state assembly.
