NEW DELHI: After a green activist raised the issue of a   shooting being conducted at   allegedly in violation of a   order, the New Delhi Municipal Council said it would look into the matter.

 Suhas Borker, a founding member of Green Circle — a voluntary group of activists — alleged that   had given permission for the shooting on Saturday and the film crew was seen flouting environment norms. Borker claimed that during a visit to the garden, he found that high-voltage wires and lights used at the spot could harm birds and other species. “Several years ago, the Supreme Court had laid down guidelines for shooting films in a garden. Lodhi Garden is the lungs of Lutyen’s and NDMC is repeatedly trying to choke it by allowing such activities,” he said.
 
 When contacted, a NDMC spokesperson said: “We will inspect the garden and if there is any damage, the firm will be blacklisted.” NDMC secretary Chanchal Yadav denied that any rules were flouted while giving the firm permission to film the movie in Lodhi Garden, but said an inspection would be done and “appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that birds and other species are not affected”. 
 
 Borker claimed that NDMC had not stationed any official to inspect the film shooting, adding that “Lodhi Garden is the only place where one can find different species of birds. Across the city, rampant commercialisation has eroded the green cover”.
 
 He pointed out that the council had dug up a major portion of Lodhi Garden in December, resulting in damaging to several trees. “This is the second time in three months that such a thing has been allowed,” Borker said. In December, he claimed, a part of the garden was dug up for installation of mobile towers. The activity was stopped only after repeated protests, he claimed.
