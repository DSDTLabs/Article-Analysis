 has been trying out multiple looks in his movies, of late. 

 The superstar was seen in two appearances in Munthirivallikal Thalirkkumbol and three in his latest war drama. In his next project, which will also mark his first film with director  , the actor will sport two looks, yet again.
 
 The movie’s scriptwriter   tells us, “Lalettan will be playing two phases of the character’s life — but it’s not a long span. One of his get-ups will be with a full-grown beard. However, it wouldn’t be the salt and pepper variety he has been sporting of late. The other look will see him clean-shaven. Right now, the plan is to begin shooting by mid-May in one look and then shoot in the next, two months later.”
 
 The yet-to-be-titled movie has Mohanlal playing the vice principal of a college. A source close to the actor tells us that Mohanlal will be shooting for close to a month for Lal Jose’s film. “After that he will start the first schedule of VA Shrikumar’s Odiyan in Palakkad,” says the source. “He will re-join Lal Jose’s film again by July.”
 
 Lal Jose’s previous project was Nee-Na in 2015. The upcoming film is touted to be an entertainer. “It will have humour, action and will also be a family drama,” concludes Benny, adding that the team is now finalising the rest of the cast of the film. The movie also has Anoop Menon, Priyanka Nair and Reshma of Angamaly Diaries fame in supporting roles.
 
 Meanwhile, Mohanlal is currently shooting for B Unni-krishnan’s thriller Villain, which also has the actor in two looks.
