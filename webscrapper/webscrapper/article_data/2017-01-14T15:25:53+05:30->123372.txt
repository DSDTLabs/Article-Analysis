AURANGABAD: Getting accorded with the   has been still proving a distant dream for   (BAMU) which celebrated its 23rd renaming ceremony, on Saturday. While all-out efforts being made by vice-chancellor and his team for past more than two years to get central university status, hopes were high that the demand would get nod from the State and the Centre during recently concluded 125th birth anniversary celebrations of Dr Ambedkar.

 “We, in fact, had renewed hopes of getting desired tag with Maharashtra minister ( ) getting appointed at the help of concerned Ministry of Human Resource and Development (HRD). Hopes are still alive that desired policy decision would be taken in near future,” a senior BAMU official said.
 
 While the BAMU authorities were pushing the proposal for the central university coinciding with the 125th birth anniversary celebrations of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, they are highlighting an example of a university from Bihar, which is said to have accorded with the central university status despite adverse stand of the MHRD on according such status to any new institution in future. The reasons of "legacy issues, adjustment of existing staff and disaffiliation of affiliated colleges" have been cited by the Ministry while expressing its stand against granting central university status.
 
 Gajanan Sanap, a former senate member of BAMU, who has been associated with official efforts for seeking central university status, said the concerned proposal was pending at government level.
 
 “The state government needs to submit our proposal to the Centre, but the same is getting delayed,” he said.
 
 Elaborating upon the benefits of receiving central university status, authorities reiterated that getting accorded with desired status would ensure flow of large amount of funding for the University for Infrastructural Development and other growth, besides facilitating increased number of scholarships and quality faculties.
