 The spare parts which were also seized with Indian Made Foreign Liquor were meant to be used for making bicycles that are distributed during Garib Kalyan Mela by state government.

When the surveillance squad of the police station checked the truck they found orange coloured spare parts of bicycle. On moving the spare parts, cops found boxes filled with liquor bottles and cans.

Hakam Singh Harijan, the driver of the truck who was arrested, told the police that the liquor consignment was sent from Haryana, while the bicycle spare parts are from Ludhiana.
 
 “It could be a possibility that the person who sent the liquor knew that the truck was going to Gandhinagar to deliver the spare parts. Therefore he dispatched the liquor stock in it,” said D M Vyas, police inspector, Padra police station. He added that they have got details of the person who had sent the liquor from Haryana and will try to nab him first.
