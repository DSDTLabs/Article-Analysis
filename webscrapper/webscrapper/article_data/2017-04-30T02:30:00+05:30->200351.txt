Nagpur:   organizations would be coming together on May 1 to hoist a ‘symbolic flag’ of Vidarbha state at Vishnuji ki Rasaoi at Bajaj Nagar. Former advocate general of Maharashtra Shreehari Aney and important Vidarbha protagonists will be present for the flag hoisting at 9am.

 The function is organized by Vidarbha Connect (VCan) a forum set up with a view top bring together all organizations and individuals fighting for the cause. In a press statement issued on Saturday, VCan president Mukesh Samarth said the demand is very old yet no government has taken it seriously.
 
 “Over 35,000 farmers of Vidarbha have ended their lives because of the government’s blatant apathy towards creating infrastructure for better agricultural growth. Most professional bodies, trade and business groupings as well as local bodies and corporations have passed resolutions seeking separation of Vidarhha region from Maharashtra . VCan will renew its pledge to continue its fight,” Samarth said.
 
 Meanwhile the state government will observe Maharashtra Day on May 1 as ‘transform Maharashtra Day’. While guardian minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule will preside over the state formation day function in the city, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will interact with youth contributing to the development in various fields. A special exhibition will be arranged in Mumbai to showcase state’s progress since its inception 57 years ago.
