CHENNAI: When   arrived at the Selaiyur gated community where he worked on Wednesday evening with Rithesh Sai, no one suspected a thing. 

 The guards, residents and his colleagues in the real estate firm in Harini’s   had often seen the nine-year-old with Nagaraj and thought it was a casual visit.
 
 On Thursday, news that Nagaraj had murdered Rithesh in his office came like a bolt from the blue. While his collegues were left in disbelief, residents of the complex on IAF Road in Indira Nagar were yet to come to terms with the fact that the boy they had seen frolicking in the complex park had been brutally done to death right in their midst.
 
 “We are now scared to let our children play outside. The killing has shaken us,” said Ramanujam, a resident.
 
 The gated community with 250 houses in eight towers is well guarded with an elaborate security detail and a network of CCTV cameras. Security guard  , who was on night duty when Nagaraj arrived with Rithesh in an autorickshaw, believed it was one of the man’s regular visits. Even when Nagaraj went out alone, he thought he was going out to buy food.
 
 Ramapuram resident Nagaraj went in and out of the complex, where his employer had set up an office on the second floor of Block 1. A woman resident on the first floor said she did not hear any sound from the office right on top of her flat. It seemed that Nagaraj adored the boy, said Mahesh Kumar, a colleague. 
 
 “Even his Facebook profile picture had Rithesh. He rarely shared his personal issues with us but I have seen him bringing the boy and playing with him in the park,” he added. “He introduced the child as his friend’s son and the child addressed him as uncle. Nagaraj had done his BBA from a private college in  ,” said Mahesh.
