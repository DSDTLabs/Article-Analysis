KOLKATA: At least six pilgrims were killed and 10 injured in a stampede on Sunday afternoon at the Kachuberia jetty in Sagar Island, South 24-Parganas, while trying to board a vessel back to Kolkata from the  . 

 All six victims, two of them women, were aged between 60 and 75, police said. None was from Bengal.
 
  The stampede occurred at jetty No. 5 at Kachuberia ghat, where thousands of pilgrims had been waiting since 10am to board vessels to cross the Muriganga river to Kakdwip, some 85km from Kolkata. However, South 24-Parganas district magistrate P B Saleem said the pilgrims had fallen ill because of the cold and eventually died at the hospital. 
 
 "According to information I have, there was no major stampede. Two women had died on Saturday night from cardiac arrest and because of the extreme cold, four others died on Sunday afternoon," he said.
 
  But his account is at variance with what sources told TOI , according to whom the stampede occurred around 3.30pm when the pilgrims broke a barricade in their mad rush to get into the vessel. 
 
 Bankim Hajra, the MLA from Sagar Island, said the vessels could not start from Kachuberia because of low tide between 10am till 3pm. When they were about to start, people standing in queue rushed to get on to the vessel, causing the crush. "As a result, some of the barricades broke. Some devotees who fell into the water were rescued," Hajra said. 
 
 The injured were taken to a hospital in Sagar Island, where six of them were declared dead. The rest were being treated till late on Sunday. Most of the victims died of suffocation, doctors at the hospital said.
