The Nandamuri Kalyan Ram-Kajal Aggarwal-starrer  , which released in theatres on Friday, has generated highest opening day collections in Kalyan Ram’s career. And the film’s producers —  , Bharath Chowdary, TG Vishwa Prasad and Vivek Kuchibhotla, are thrilled.
“Even in the US, there has been a tremendous response with 200 premier shows. Our first film   gave us a good footing in Tollywood and we wanted our second film to live up to that benchmark. MLA has done that for us,” says Kiran Reddy. His partner   is grateful to Kalyan Ram for the latter’s dedication which, he says, was instrumental in the film releasing on time.
  “We had planned to release the film on Ugadi, well in advance. Kalyan Ram garu suffered a wrist injury during the shooting. Ideally, he should have taken time off for the injury to heal completely. Since that would have delayed the film’s release, he continued shooting so as not to disrupt the schedule. Today, the success of the film, in a large measure, is due to his professionalism,” avers Bharat Chowdary. 
 With the governments of the two Telugu states declaring Monday (Sri Ramanavami) as a public holiday, the movie will get a further impetus, believes TG Vishwa Prasad. “The collections are increasing by 20 per cent for every show based on good word-of-mouth and by the end of Monday, the buyers will break even,” he says. 
 Vivek Kuchibhotla has a word of praise for the director,  . ‘Despite being a debutant, Upendra executed the project well and justified our faith in him. In recent times, there have been very few films which can be watched with the whole family. MLA is one such film,” concludes Vivek.
