Composer Yuvan Shankar Raja’s wife,  , has reasons to smile. She is debuting as a costume designer with  , starring   and   of Bigg Boss Tamil fame. Zafroon says, “I have designed the costumes for Raiza in the movie, and it has been a challenging, yet fun experience.” 

 She says that she is a designer who dropped out of fashion designing course, and reasons, “Designing comes naturally to me and I don’t think it can be taught.” So, what attracted her to movies? “Every designer will have someone in mind while designing costumes and I found that Raiza matched the muse I’d in my imagination. She is very pretty, confident and can carry off any outfit with elan.”
 
 Zafroon is being flooded with congratulatory messages after the single from the movie released. “I am very happy with the outcome. In fact, the movie’s requirements suit my taste well. I love pastel colours, digital prints and flowy designs,” she says. 
 
 Ask her how challenging is designing costumes for movies, and she quips, “I am a full-time mother to a young child; it’s of course challenging. But I make sure that all the important sequences are discussed in advance with the team and the actress. Also, I go to the spot when important scenes are being shot. But the most challenging task is to come up with costumes within the shoe-string budget.” 
 
 She says that she has sourced the materials from the city itself. “Except for the accessories, I got everything from Chennai. I bought the accessories from Dubai. I’m really excited about a fantasy sequence, for which I’ve designed some interesting costumes, and I’m really looking forward to it.” 
 
 Interestingly, Yuvan has composed the songs for the film. Ask her what his reaction was to her work in it, and she says with a smile, “He’s obviously happy; it’s his first production venture and I am glad that I could do my bit in his first project.”
