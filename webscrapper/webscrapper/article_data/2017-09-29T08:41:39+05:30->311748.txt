If you happen to visit the stretch between   and Subhash Nagar, you will find huge bamboo and papier-mâché heads and torsos, occupying pretty much any available space, waiting to be assembled into effigies of the demon king Ravana and Kumbhkaran and Meghnad. The effigy makers of Titarpur are in high spirits. Like every year, they are busy giving final touches to their artwork, making glue from wheat flour and sticking glazed paper on the pieces. While they were expecting sales to go down post-GST, the number of effigies sold shows no dip from last year.

 The craze for Baahubali is still continuing, with customers demanding Baahubali-like features on the effigies of Ravana, Kumbhkaran and Meghnad. Mohammad Amjad, an effigy maker from Khyala Gaon, who comes to Titarpur every year at this time of year, says, "While regular Ravana effigies with huge moustaches are in demand like every year, a few customers are asking for Baahubali features this year. We have made Baahubali mukuts (headgear) and given six-pack abs to some of the effigies."

 Ravana effigies wearing dhotis were introduced last year, and are in high demand this year as well. "Customers are asking for dhotiwala Ravana this year as well. Mostly in bright colours, these dhotis give a different look to the effigy," says Gauri Shankar, another effigy maker.
