AHMEDABAD:   (AMC) on Friday raided a radiology centre in Saijpur Bogha, Harsh Digital X-Ray, for performing illegal sex determination tests. 

 Civic authorities raided the clinic after they took a pregnant woman there as a decoy, to have tests performed and verify the tip-off they had received. AMC health department officials will file a case against the radiology centre in a court within two days, for violation of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition Of Sex Selection) (PCPNDT) Act, 1994.
 
 Bhavin  , AMC's medical officer of health, said, "We received a tip-off and sent a team with a pregnant woman as a decoy to verify the information. The woman called the clinic and was asked to meet their agent near  . A health worker accompanied the woman to the location and our team followed. The agent met them there and asked for Rs 13,000."
 
 "The woman paid the sum and then the agent took them to the clinic through a backdoor. A technician performed a sonography and told the woman that it was too early to ascertain the sex of the fetus and she should return after 10-15 days. The next day, a team from health department visited the clinic with the woman and identified the technician, who later admitted to performing a sex determination test. The woman also identified the agent who took her to the radiology centre," said Solanki.
 
 AMC officials immediately sealed machines at the clinic. Solanki added that the agent denied having accepted money from the woman. "She denied accepting Rs 13,000 from the patient and we've also lodged a complaint with   against the agent," said Solanki.
