BHOPAL: Chief minister  , state BJP president Nandkumar Singh Chauhan and party's organisational general secretary Suhas Bhagat headed a marathon meeting in Ratibad on Saturday. The meeting comes just four days before the scheduled visit to the state by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. 

 Till late in the evening, Chouhan and state's top BJP brass were planning the RSS chief's visit.
 
 Other top RSS leaders like Suresh Bhaiyyaji Joshi, Suresh Soni, Dattatreya Hosabale and Krishna Gopal will also attend the scheduled functions. Sources in the state BJP said a series of sub-meetings on organisational matters with district-level party general secretaries was held.
 
 BJP has also called prominent grassroots workers from 10 major 'sambhag' (divisions) of the RSS to Ratibad. 
 
  The main point on the agenda was strengthening of the organisation in Madhya Pradesh and preparation of functions to be attended by Bhagwat. 
 
 An area of concern is the first function - Hindu Sammelan in Betul, scheduled for February 8, which is also likely to be attended by BJP leader   of Uttarakhand. The BJP wants to make it a big event despite apprehensions that certain social organisations might create hindrances. 
 
 Bhagwat will address a gathering at the silver jubilee celebrations of   in Bankheri area of Hoshangabad on February 9. On the occasion of Sant Ravidas Jayanti on February 10, the RSS chief will speak at a mega rally at the Lal Parade Ground in Bhopal, which will be attended by labourers and some trade union wings. The function has been scheduled for 4 pm. 
 
 Next day, he will address another public meeting in Bairagarh to commemorate the birth anniversary of Jan Sangh patriarch Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay. The BJP's working committee members will possibly be allowed to attend this function.
 
 After the Bairagarh function, he will leave for Ujjain where he will meet and hold discussions with RSS workers from Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh over the next two days.
