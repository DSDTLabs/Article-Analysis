ROHTAK: Hundreds of unemployed stone-quarry labourers laid siege to the house of Bhiwani BJP MP Dharambir Singh on Monday. 

 The protesters from Tosham in  , who had been protesting for a month, bolted the gates of the   in Bhiwani and   outside, seeking their   at Khanak Hill mine, restarted in December 2016.
 
 The kept raising slogans for about an hour until they were moved by the police.
 
 When the cops arrived, Dharambir came out to hear the protesters' grievances and assured that the issue would be resolved within four days.
 
 The MP told mediapersons said the labourers were employed as stone-breakers for about 50 years, but after the government leased the quarry to Haryana State Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (HSIIDC), they were thrown out.
 
 A protester said HSIIDC had not re-employed locals for the job, rendering thousands of them unemployed. "The local workers made stone mining viable at Khanak Hill. Now, the government has evicted the labourers by giving the contract to HSIIDC, which is using machines for the stone-breaking," said the protesters.
 
 They maintained that work at Khanak Hill was their bread and butter and Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had promised their rehabilitation at a rally.
 
 The CM had announced the re-opening of Khanak Hill, shut for over a decade, at a rally in Tosham on November 7, 2016. Its operations were banned due to environmental issues in 2006 by the then Congress government.
