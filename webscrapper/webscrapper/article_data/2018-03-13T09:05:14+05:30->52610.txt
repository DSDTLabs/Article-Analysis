CHANDIGARH: N-choe on the border of Sector 51and   is choked with garbage. Looking at it suggests that providing clean surroundings in this part of the city is not a priority with the UT Administration.

 On a visit to this channel, the TOI team spotted a dead calf in the water. A passerby said that the animal had fallen into the choe by accident two days ago and drowned. Littered with garbage, the choe is a constant source of bad smell in the surroundings. On Mohali side, it touches the boundary wall of a private school, where children keep going to the management with complaints about the stink.
 
 A resident of Sector 51 said: “Many children take a bridge over the N-choe to go to schools in Mohali. The civic authorities should clean the area at least for their sake.” Sector-51 citizen welfare society (CWS) president   said he had raised the issue many times with the authorities concerned but no team had come over to clean the channel. Another demand of the residents is for a concrete bridge over the Nchoe or a concrete road so that the schoolchildren don’t have to take this route to Mohali.   adviser Dr   said: “When the sector came up, there used to be a concrete bridge over the N-choe but it got damaged. The residents made repeated demands for a replacement bridge. These schoolchildren who go to Mohali travel more than 3 kilometres a day. The present bridge can be crossed only on bicycle or foot. A concrete bridge will allow the children to reach school faster and safer.” CWS vice-president   said: “The stink intensifies after garbage flows into the choe during rain. A breakout is possible.”
