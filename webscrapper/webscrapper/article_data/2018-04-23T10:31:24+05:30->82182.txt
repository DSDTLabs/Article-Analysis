JAIPUR: Chairperson of the state commission for women   on Sunday claimed that there had been a decline of 21 per cent in the number of criminal cases registered in 2017 as compared to 2013.

 Lashing out at former chief minister  , who had recently targeted chief minister   over rising crime against women, Sharma said, “In 2013, when Gehlot was the CM, a total of 32152 criminal cases were registered but in 2017, 25560 cases - 21 per cent less - were registered. Gehlot is only pretending to be concerned about women security. He had failed to take measures for it when he was the CM,’’ said Sharma. Gehlot on Friday had said that Raje was insensitive towards the plight of women in the state. “
 
 Sharma refuted the allegations made by Gehlot and said that CM Raje has initiated measures for stringent laws in March. ``Rajasthan has already introduced provisions for a death penalty for those found guilty of raping a girl younger than 12 years. Now, even the   government in the centre has introduced provisions for this also adding that those found guilty of raping a giril in the age group of 12 to 16 years, will be imprisoned for 20 years. The amended law also ensures that investigations are completed within two months of the crime and that the case is decided within six months,’’ she said.
 
 She accused Gehlot of making rape a political issue and trying to gain milage from it during the election year. ``In his tenure ministers were sent to jail for rape charges. So, a party who neither showed any seriousness in handling such cases nor made any strict laws, should not defame other party” said Sharma.
