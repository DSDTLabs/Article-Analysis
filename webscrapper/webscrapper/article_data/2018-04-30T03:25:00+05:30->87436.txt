Panaji: The central government’s proposal to reduce the costal regulation zone (CRZ) limit from the existing 200m to 50m and from 100m to 50m along estuarine stretches was opposed at a gram sabha of Quelossim panchayat. The members opposed the proposed changes to CRZ 2011, stating that it would adversely impact the coastal and riverine ecology. The sand dunes which protect coastal villages will be destroyed and rampant constructions will mushroom, Lopinho Xavier, a member said. The meeting, chaired by sarpanch Maria D’Souza, also discussed the proposed changes in the panchayat rules wherein only business on the agenda will be taken up. If any important issues crops up after submission of proposals by members, they will have to wait for three months till the next gram sabha. With the chairperson’s permission, the panchayat can discuss important issues, they said. A letter dated March 14, 2018 by Movaj Enterprises regarding the Mini India Park project kicked off some dust. The firm had shown interest in setting up an eco-recreational floating platform at the site. The panchayat had revoked permission after the Investment Promotion Board withdrew its approval. Members told the panchayat to initiate action if work was taken up illegally.
