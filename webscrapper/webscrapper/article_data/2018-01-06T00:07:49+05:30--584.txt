New Delhi: Different labs of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research ( ), India’s key scientific research body, have joined hands for developing eco-friendly firecrackers and arriving at a cost-effective technology to make e-crackers (electronic  ) available to Indian consumers across the country. 

 These labs took this initiative in the backdrop of the strong concerns raised on effects of highly polluting firecrackers on human health.
 
 “Several CSIR laboratories have come together and are putting together a robust S&T strategy for development of eco-friendly firecrackers and fireworks”, said Girish Sahni, director general of the CSIR.
 
 He said the first phase would cover reduction of pollutants while future strategies would cover removal of pollutants from the compositions (of crackers).
 
 Union environment and science & technology minister Harsh Vardhan had last year sensitised the scientific institutions and research bodies on the issue of pollution due to firecrackers and urged them to arrive at a solution by researching on eco-friendly firecrackers.
