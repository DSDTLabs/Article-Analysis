MUMBAI: A special trial judge on Monday deferred   of the first   in the   case till after the  ,  , deposes.   posted the trial to proceed on July 28 for the second prosecution witness to depose. The judge asked CBI to inform in advance who is its next witness —it is likely the prosecution will examine Rai as its second witness.

 Indrani, her former husband Sanjeev Khanna and her former driver Rai were arrested for allegedly murdering Indrani’s daughter Sheena and disposing of the body in a Raigad forest in April 2012. Rai later turned approver. Indrani’s husband   was also made an accused.
 
 Shrikant Shivade, defence lawyer for Peter, who had made a plea for deferring the cross-examination of police inspector Ganesh Dalvi till after Rai testifies, argued that it would cause prejudice to the defence. Shivade said Dalvi had probed and recorded Rai’s statement in another case—for illegal arms possession. He said what Dalvi has said in his   and the documents he has cited would be used to cross-examine Rai and depending on the latter’s replies, Dalvi would again be confronted with the replies. He said hence, Dalvi’s cross-examination ought to be deferred. Advocate Ayaz Khan, representing  , and advocate Shreyans Mithare, representing Khanna, adopted Shivade’s arguments.
 
 CBI prosecutors Bharat Badami and Kavita Patil opposed the plea to defer mainly on the grounds that the ‘piecemeal recording of evidence would distort concentration of the witness, Dalvi’. —Swati Deshpande
