PATNA: Zonal IG (Patna) Nayyar Hasnain   has rejected the request of Patna ASP (operation) Rakesh Dubey to spare him from the ongoing investigation into   Staff Selection Commission (BSSC) question leak case.
 
  Dubey is a key officer in the special investigation team (SIT) formed on the direction of Khan on February 6 soon after CM   announced scrapping of the BSSC four-phase intermediate level clerical grade examination following questions went viral before the second phase examination.
  
  The SIT was formed with nine police officers, including ASP Dubey, who played a major role in the raids and interrogation of top BSSC officials in the case. Patna SSP   is leading the SIT.
  
  The SIT investigation led to the arrest of the then BSSC chairman and 1987 batch IAS official   and its secretary Parmeshwar Ram. Names of a few principal secretary rank officers and some big political figures surfaced during the investigation in which Dubey played a major role after his stint with the CBI.
  
  When asked, Khan said Dubey had requested to separate him from the investigation on personal grounds. “He is neither going for any training nor has been transferred anywhere. He had also not cited any particular personal reason to consider his request,” said Khan.
  
  Khan said he also discussed Dubey’s issue with Patna SSP before refusing his request. “The investigation has to be taken to a logical conclusion on the basis of evidences gathered till now,” the IG said, adding that a few persons linked with the scam are still to be nabbed. He also said Anand Preet Singh Barar, the BSSC evaluator and a key player in the scam, also has to be taken on remand again for interrogation.
  
  Dubey did not respond to the phone calls to make any comment.
