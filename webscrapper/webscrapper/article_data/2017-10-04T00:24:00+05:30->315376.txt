Pune: Economic growth is not directly related to bad loan resolution, and the latter is a legacy of the past, according to Ashok Lavasa, finance secretary, Government of India. He also said that the fall in economic (GDP) growth has bottomed out and that the economy will get back on the growth path from now. 

 Bad loans account for between 12-19% of the total advances for most scheduled commercial banks in India, despite the government’s claim of over 7% GDP growth in the last 9 out of 12 quarters. The RBI has also put six banks with high levels of NPAs under prompt corrective action.
 
 In Pune, to inaugurate a workshop on Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, at the NIBM, the finance secretary said, “I don’t think bank recoveries are directly related to growth. These are problems of the past. So they do not have a direct relation between the levels of growth.”
 
 Lavasa’s comments come at a time when there is debate over what the economic growth really is, with former finance minister Yashwant Sinha pegging it to a new low of “3.7% or less” in the first quarter of FY2018. “I think what we saw in the first quarter was virtually a bottoming out. From now on, I think the uptick has started. I foresee that the growth levels will now bounce back,” Lavasa told TOI on the sidelines.
 
 The finance secretary said that the “human element,” is an important determinant on how the systems work. He was replying to a question on why recovery tools like the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 have not yielded the desired results.
 
 “Behind every system there is a human being. He can make a success of that system or lead to the failure of the system. The human element is extremely important,” he said, adding, “the government is committed to providing all support,” to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India for the same to succeed.
