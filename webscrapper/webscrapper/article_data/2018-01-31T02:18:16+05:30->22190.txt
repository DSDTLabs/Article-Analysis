NEW DELHI: Disgruntled   MP   was among politicians who attended the launch of a new political forum by former Union minister   on Tuesday. 

 Pledging to launch a movement against the policies of the central government, Yashwant Sinha unveiled the ‘Rashtra Manch’, a political forum. 
 
 “Rashtra Manch will be a non-party political action group... it is not against any party but will work to highlight national issues,” Sinha said while launching the forum. Hitting out at the government's economic and foreign policies, he said it was not an organisation but a national movement.
 
 "Everybody in the BJP is living in fear. We are not," Sinha said, adding, “Dialogue and debate in the country has become coarse, one-sided and dangerous.” 
 
 Trinamool Congress MP Dinesh Trivedi, Congress MP Renuka Chowdhury, NCP MP Majeed Memon, Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh, former Gujarat CM Suresh Mehta and JD(U) leader Pavan Verma were among those who attended the event. RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary and former Union ministers Som Pal and Harmohan Dhawan were also present.
 
 Sinha likened the present situation to that which prevailed 70 years ago when Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated and said democracy and its institutions were under attack.
 
 He claimed the Narendra Modi government had reduced farmers to "the status of beggars" and accused it of presenting "made to order" statistics to suit its interests. Taking up farmers' issues would be the top priority of his organisation, he said.
 
 The former finance minister claimed the first leg of the budget session of Parliament would effectively have only four working days, something that was “unprecedented”. 
 
 Shatrughan Sinha said he had joined the platform because he had not been given a forum in his party to express his views, but added that his decision to back the front should not be seen as an anti-party activity as it was in national interest.
