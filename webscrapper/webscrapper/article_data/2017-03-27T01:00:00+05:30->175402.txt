Shubhashish Bhutiani, the director of the multi-award winning film ' ' (international title: Hotel Salvation), reveals that his film, which deals with a father-son relationship drew heavily from his equation with his father Sanjay, also one of the producers.“While I was developing the script, we also participated in a workshop. Like the characters of the film, I also had to share a hotel room with my father for 10 days,” laughs the filmmaker, adding, “It was strange for me to be my dad’s roommate. We saw our personalities come to the fore. Sometimes, we would argue and sometimes we would just discuss things. On days when we had a difference of opinion, we would sort it out by indulging in some banter. As writers, we often pull out things from our own lives or observations. There are multiple scenes that, consciously or subconsciously, have made their way into the movie. One of the central themes in the film deals with people juggling different aspects of their lives along with caring for their elderly parents.”

 Meanwhile, Sanjay also had his moments of realisation when the film was being shot with  , Lalit Behl,  , Palomi Ghosh, Navindra Behl and Anil K Rastogi on real locations. He says, “I realised that my son can say no to me. All his life I have told him what to do and it was beautiful to see the child, I once held in my arms, take the lead. The emotion of creating a company together, which is our collective dream, can’t be compared with anything else in the world.”
 
 Shubhashish signs off, saying, “While writing the film, I remember thinking, ‘I hope that this is the kind of film that makes people call their families.’ Someone who saw the film told me they did that. It was one of the most heart-warming responses I’ve received so far.”
