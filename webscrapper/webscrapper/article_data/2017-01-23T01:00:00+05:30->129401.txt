It was literally love in the air for   who first met his fiancée,  , on a flight. Three years later, the actor and the air-hostess will tie the knot in Gurgaon on Valentine’s Day. 
Talking about his romance, Amit recalls, “Most of our romance happened mid-air, as I would travel to different cities to meet her.” 
 And what’s a love story without adversities? It took the couple a long time to win their parents’ support. Says Amit, “I’m a Rajasthani Brahmin and Cheshta is a Punjabi. Our families were against the match because we’re from different castes. In fact, I never thought our relationship would culminate into marriage, because I would never have gone against my parents’ wishes.” 
 It was his ladylove’s dream to get married on Valentine’s Day. “Cheshta also wants to have not seven, but eight pheras. During the eighth phera, I have to lift her and vow that I will take her nakhras all my life like I have in the past,” he adds.
 Preparations for the wedding are on in full swing. The haldi and sangeet will take place on February 12 and 13, while the reception will be held on the 14th. Amit says, “Unlike most receptions, Cheshta and I won’t sit on a stage. We will walk around and meet everyone. The idea is to dance and enjoy.” 
 And what about their honeymoon plan? “We plan to go on one every month, beginning with a trip to Thailand,” he signs off.
