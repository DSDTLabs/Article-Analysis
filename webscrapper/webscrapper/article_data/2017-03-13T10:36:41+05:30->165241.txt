BHOPAL: Illegal   is drilling deeper into   with frequent clashes between different factions being reported across different parts of the state. The worrying trend is the rampant use of underwater machines – which locals call ‘deshi pandupis’ (submarines).

 The state administration has confiscated three locally engineered ‘submarines’ on banks of Sindh river in Gohad on Sunday.
 
 The crackdown was part of a follow-up action by the law enforcers after the killing of a 23-year-old farmer, Ingej Kushwaha, who voiced against illegal sand mining in Gohad’s Kachchpura area on Friday.
 
 Besides three submarines, the officials have also impounded five excavators from the spot. These machines were being used to dig out sand from the river banks.
 
 Many other sand miners in the   region are using these underwater machines for digging out sand from the bottom of the river. Officials believe many such ‘submarines’ are operating on Chambal and Sindh River banks.
 
 Sand mafias gunned down Ingej and injured two others for arguing with them over a mining issue near the agriculture land of the deceased.
 
 In 2014, Chambal range police had unearthed an illegal underground mining unit at Sindhi river of Datia district in the Chambal region. The police team, led by the then Inspector general D C Sagar, had seized three boats laden with heavy mining equipment, including diesel suction pumps and a large quantity of illegally mined sand from the spot. The mine was being operated by Ajay Yadav and his brother Narendra, both listed as criminals with Sinawal police area of the district. The spot is 25 km away from district headquarters.
 
 “The Madhya Pradesh government has not set clear guidelines on the use of suction pumps for legal mining too. “It is important to ban suction pumps because it can extract sand from the river bed with minimum effort,” said a senior lawyer seeking CBI inquiry to expose the mining syndicate in Chambal region.
