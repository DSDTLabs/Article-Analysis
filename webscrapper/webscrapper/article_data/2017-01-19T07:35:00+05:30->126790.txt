LUMBI:   chief   kick-started his campaign in chief minister (CM) Parkash Singh Badal’s assembly constituency, Lambi, on Wednesday with a massive roadshow and a rally in the town falling in Muktsar district.

 On Wednesday morning, Amarinder reached Malout town to file his nomination. After filing the papers, he took out the roadshow from Malout to Lambi, passing through villages en route. Residents of Bhai Ka Kera, Fallu Khera and Kuttianwali villages, through which the rally passed, said the roadshow was the biggest they had ever seen. “I have seen nearly a dozen elections, but never in my whole life I have seen such a big roadshow in this area. It is for the first time that a political leader has challenged the might of Badal on such a largescale,” said   of Fallu Khera after the cavalcade passed through his village.
 
 With Amarinder in fray from Lambi, it has turned into the biggest electoral fight in the February 4 Punjab elections, with a former CM taking on the incumbent chief minister. It is presumed to be the last elections of the two senior-most leaders of their respective parties —   (SAD) and Congress.
 
 A young SAD supporter   said Amarinder’s cavalcade took 20 minutes to pass before his house. “I have seen Amarinder for the first time. Despite his taking out a big roadshow, Akali Dal will remain unbeatable in the area,” he said.
 
 The Punjab Congress chief has opened his office in Lambi, where people murmured and admitted that the roadshow by him would make an impact in the tough contest.
 
 NRI Mohinder Singh (75), who has come from Brampton in Canada only a few weeks earlier, said, “With Amarinder jumping in the fray, it will be the most keenly watched contest in Punjab. In the previous poll battles, we used to easily predict the outcome, but not this time.”
