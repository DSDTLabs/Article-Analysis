CHJANDIGARH: In what comes as   and working women looking for  , the oldest working women's hostel situated in  , Sector 23 will re-open in July. The department of social welfare, UT, has started enrolment for the hostel, which can accomodate 50 girls.

 There has been no addition in the number of hostels in the city over the last 20 years even as demand has risen sharply. As a result, the PG business is flourishing. Most of the PGs are located in sectors 15, 37 and 38 and rates vary from Rs 8,000 to Rs 9,500 per person with food. The PG rent without food also starts from Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000, depending on the location.
 
 As for food, the department decided that inmates will initially have tiffin service in the hostel, for which they will be charged over and above the hostel rent. Later, tenders will be floated for the mess, which will be allocated to a contractor by the social welfare department.
 
 The social welfare department has constituted a committee to chalk out a plan about staff and basic infrastructure in each room. UT social welfare department director   said the rent of the hostel will be economical. At present, there are two working women's hostels in the city. These include one in Sector 11, run by an NGO, Young Women's Christian Association and in Sector 24, run by the social welfare department. These hostels can accommodate 136 women. The working women's hostel in Sector 23 had been closed for renovation for the past six years.
