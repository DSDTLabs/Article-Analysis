GUWAHATI:   and   are   as the  's   

 On May 28, Congress has decided to observe 'pratarana' (betrayal) day, while BJP has planned booth-level meetings across the state.
 
 "It is our one year vs their 15 years," BJP spokesperson Pramod Swami said. "In fact, it will be more appropriate to say that the state has failed in the last 60 years when Congress was in power for the most part. We have already exposed Congress, as seen in the assembly polls. We will do it again this time," he added.
 
 The panchayat elections are scheduled to be held later this year.
 
 BJP leaders said the objective of booth-level meetings would be to apprise the people at the grassroots level on the major steps the state government has taken in ushering development, fighting corruption and implementing welfare schemes. 
 
 Along with the achievements of the state government, BJP leaders said the grassroots workers will go all-out in highlighting the failures of the 15 years of Congress rule.
 
 Congress has similar plans in mind. On pratarana day, it will take up the "major failures" of and "promises unkept" by the BJP-led government. Congress has also planned a series of protest programmes, saying that it will take to the people the failures of the BJP-led government during one year.
 
 Swami accused Congress of spreading misinformation that BJP has "hijacked" the state's saints. "Now that we have proposed to name roads after saints of the state, Congress blames BJP. Our question is why, then, did the Congress fail to do so when it was in power. Instead, it was bent on giving names to streets, stadium, hospitals and many other things after a particular family," Swami said.
