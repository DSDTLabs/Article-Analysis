GAYA: Defying tradition that forbids women to perform   rituals (the ritual is performed by male descendants for the salvation of souls), a group of 16 women from Russia, Kazakistan and Switzerland performed the rituals at the Vishnupadband temple and other notified altars (vedis) in   on Sunday.

 All 16 women who performed the pindadan rituals, impressed by the work being done by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKON), had embraced Hinduism. Besides their ancestors, some of them also performed pindadaan for their late husbands.
 
 They were baptised in the new faith by Lok Nath Gaur. Gaur has been preaching Hinduism in Russia and other parts of former USSR. In September 2017 also, several women from the west including the US had performed pindadaan rituals. According to Gaur, “These women embraced Hinduism on their own free will. They now lead life according to Hindu customs and traditions and have become strict vegetarians.”
 
 When asked that as per Hindu tradition, women cannot perform pindadaan, Gaur said it is a misconception and the Garur Purana categorically mentions that even women can perform pindadaan.
 
 On the point that husband does not come within the ambit of ancestry as mandated in pindadaan rituals, the ISKON missionary said husbands cannot be excluded from salvation rituals.
