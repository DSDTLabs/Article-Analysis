HYDERABAD: Telangana Pradesh   Committee (TPCC) president N Uttam Kumar Reddy led a candlelight march from People's Plaza to Indira Gandhi statue on Necklace Road on Saturday evening in protest against the Kathua and Unnao rape cases. 

 Uttam said the   government had failed to provide security to women. "Prime Minister   raises ' ' slogans, but his government has failed to provide minimum security to women. It is shameful that instead of taking action against the guilty, some BJP leaders have openly supported the culprits," he said while referring to the two rapes.
 
 Uttam said the candlelight march was organised in Hyderabad and all district headquarters on the directions of Congress president Rahul Gandhi to protest against the crimes being committed against women.
 
 "We strongly condemn the atrocities against women in various parts of the country. The Congress is for women's rights and it condemns the recent incidents that have shaken the entire country," he said. 
 
 Hundreds of Congress activists held placards seeking justice for the victims.
