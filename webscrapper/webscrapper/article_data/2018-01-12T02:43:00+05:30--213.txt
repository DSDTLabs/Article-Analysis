Nagpur: In view of the financial crisis, NMC standing committee chairman Sandip Jadhav has slammed officials and directed them to find alternative   to justify their salaries.

 Jadhav held a meeting of the standing committee on Thursday. “City transport department officials only demand release of payments to bus operators, and never concentrate on alternative revenue sources to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue. It is the responsibility of officials from all departments to find new revenue sources instead of depending upon existing ones. Revenue is not increasing at par with expenses. Responsibility will be fixed on officials for revenue from now onwards.”
 
 Jadhav also slammed officials and employees of property tax department for huge arrears. “I asked officials to start recovering arrears instead of waiting for demand notes. None of the employees are interested in recovering arrears. Zone-wise review meetings will be organized in the coming days. Action will be taken if recovery not satisfactory,” he said.
 
 The standing committee approved appointment of private agency for conducting survey of 40,000 applicants who sought flats under Housing For All scheme. Survey will be conducted to verify details submitted by applicants in the applications.
