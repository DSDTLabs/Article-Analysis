KOLKATA: Much progress is unlikely on Metro projects in Kolkata or the suburbs that are not already under way till 2020, sources in the ministry of railways said. The ministry will evaluate the progress of the ongoing projects after 2020 and then decide on the fate of the other plans. Metro Railway hopes to commission at least 51km of the planned 87.38km under progress at that time.

 "We have not decided whether to extend the lines to Barrackpore and Barasat, though the state government has offered assistance. Metro Railway has assured that a large chunk of the under-construction network of the E-W Metro corridor will be completed by the end of 2020. This includes the linking of the North-South corridor to Dakshineswar and the airport," a n official said.
 
 At a time when nearly political parties in  , save for the  , are protesting against "lower allocations" for the state in the railway budget this year, the ministry seems rather peeved with the delay of implementing Metro projects in Kolkata. 
 
 "Four of the five ongoing projects were sanctioned in 2010-11, but none of them have made any significant progress. Ideally, some phases should have been completed and commissioned, like in Delhi. Costs have shot up and other states are questioning why the railways is not investing in urban transportation projects there. By the time these projects are completed, there will be huge cost overruns," another official said. 
 
 After the ongoing projects are completed and commissioned, officials will look at factors such as how much revenue they can generate. While revenue from fares won't make up for the operating costs, there are plans to commercially utilize space at stations to generate funds. Till now, Metro Railway has not been able to generate sufficient non-fare revenue, primarily because the stations had not been built with that purpose in mind.
