Ahmedabad: Officials of a private hospital have filed a complaint against a patient for defaulting on a payment of Rs 3.29 lakh with Navrangpura police station. Police have started a search for the accused in the case.

 Navrangpura police said Ajit Nair, a resident of Meghaninagar, is the general manager (administration) at HCG Hospital near Mithakhali Crossroads. Nair’s complaint says that the family members of Dr Sunil Ashraf, a resident of Maldhari Society, brought Ashraf to the hospital on August 16 last year as he was having breathing problems and had a severe cough. He was admitted to the ICU for treatment.
 
 “He was later operated upon to insert a tube into his throat to ease his condition. By the end of the procedure in August, the bill was Rs 6.74 lakh. The family initially deposited Rs 10,000 but had not paid the remainder. The family directed the hospital to Kerala-based E M Najib for the payments. Najib made periodic payments but even after that, the family had to pay Rs 3.29 lakh at the end of September,” said an investigator.
 
 According to the complaint, after the family failed to pay the amount despite several reminders, they decided to lodge a complaint for cheating and breach of trust.
