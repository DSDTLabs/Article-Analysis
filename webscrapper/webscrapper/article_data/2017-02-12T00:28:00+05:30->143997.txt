Bhopal: “Unko toh khujli hai mere naam se (he feels itchy whenever he hears my name),” Congress MP from Guna and the party’s chief whip in the Lok Sabha, Jyotiraditya  , said commenting on minister for higher education Jaibhan Singh Pawaiya.

 The minister was furious on Monday when he saw the word “Shrimant” inscribed on a plaque before the name of Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia during the inauguration of a power sub-station in Ashoknagar district. Shrimant is a title traditionally used to address members of the Scindia royalty. Pawaiya, known to be a strong critic of Gwalior palace and Scindias, had instructed energy department officials to delete the word of `slavery’ from the plaque.
 
 On Friday, reporters in Gwalior asked Scindia for a reaction on the minister’s orders. That is when Scindia gave his opinion in just one sentence.
 
 Meanwhile, Pawaiya who is minister-in-charge of Ashoknagar gave his own explanation. He said, “The minister in charge is ‘Shri’ and the MP is `Shrimant’. This should not happen 70 years after the country’s independence. There was a time of such servility when the `maharaja’ was god and the others were his subjects. From the Prime Minister to everyone else, `Shri’ or `mananiya’ will be written as a mark of respect. Titles of royalty have been abolished a long time ago in this country.”
 
 Political enmity between Pawaiya and Gwalior royals go back two decades. The minister is MLA from Gwalior city and in 2014 Lok Sabha elections was fielded against Jyotiraditya from the Guna Lok Sabha seat. He contested the elections from Gwalior Lok Sabha constituency against the late Congress leader and erstwhile `maharaja’ Madhavrao Scindia in 1998. In the next general elections, Pawaiyya catured Gwalior as senior Scindia had moved to a safer Guna-Shivpuri seat.
