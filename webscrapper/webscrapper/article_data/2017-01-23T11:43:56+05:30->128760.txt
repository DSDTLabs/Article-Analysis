YAVATMAL: Harassed by private  , two petty shopkeepers committed suicide in the last 48 hours in Yavatmal. Names of the deceased are Sachin Pandhurkar (33) of   and Govind Khode (40) of Shinde Nagar.

 City police station officer NM Pant said that a criminal offence under sections 306 and 34 of IPC was registered against moneylenders   (39) and Rambhau Raut (40) â€” both residents of Tirupati Society on   following a complaint lodged by Bhagyashri, wife of Sachin, on Saturday.
 
 Bhagyashri told police that her husband had borrowed a small amount from the accused for setting up a saloon. Though Sachin had repaid the loan, the moneylenders were demanding interest which ran into hundreds of rupees. When the deceased refused to budge, they threatened him of shutting down his saloon. Frustrated by regular threats, Sachin consumed poison at his house on Tuesday evening and collapsed. He was rushed to   where he breathed his last on Friday evening.
 
 In another case, vegetable vendor Govind Khode had borrowed a small sum from an illegal private moneylender firm run by three brothers who have criminal background. Due to constant harassment, Govind ended life by hanging from the ceiling of his house. Govind is survived by wife and two sons. 
 
 Wadgaon Road police conducted spot panchnama and sent the body for post mortem. Police found two suicide notes from the deceased in which he said that he was forced to take the extreme step due to harassment by moneylender brothers. Despite this, police registered a case of accidental death. When asked, police sources told TOI that they did not receive any complaint from the kin of Govind.
