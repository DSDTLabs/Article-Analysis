NAGPUR: The BJP-ruled civic body may be boasting about works being carried out in the city but the fact is that the city's development has been adversely affected by Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s poor financial condition including huge debts. For the record,   has borrowed Rs 500 crore since 2011-2012. 

 In reply to an   query by former corporator Vedprakash Arya, NMC finance and accounts department revealed the civic body obtained Rs 200 crore loan in 2011-12, another Rs 200 crore in 2014-15 and Rs 100 crore in current financial year. All the loans were obtained from  , the reply stated.
 
 Against the Rs 500 crore loan, the cash-strapped NMC could repay only Rs 202.12 crore since 2012-13 till last financial year. 
 
 “Poor recovery of property tax, water tax, etc was responsible for the mess,” alleged Arya. The civic body earned around Rs 473.12 crore less revenue than estimated in the budget for 2015-16. NMC ended 2015-16 fiscal with revenue of Rs1,492 crore, while the budget was planned for Rs1,965.12 crore. Works worth over Rs500 crore could not be taken up due to revenue shortfall. 
 
 NMC's administrative expense is around 55% of its revenue. According to account department data, the committed expenditure of the NMC is over Rs 945 crore per annum. In the last four financial years, the civic body had to transfer funds from various accounts to meet this expenditure. During 2013-14 and 2015-16, it withdrew Rs 272.14 crore from various heads. 
 
 Arya blamed the civic body for its poor financial condition. “NMC should have taken steps to improve its revenue. Instead, it made wasteful expenditure by entrusting private agencies to carryout works that it could easily do itself.”
 
 Some of the major works affected due to funds crunch are first phase of cement road works, Suresh Bhatt auditorium, NMC administrative building, the 200 MLD sewage treatment plant (STP) at Bhandewadi and mini-STPs. Ward-level works too were affected in 2016-17 as NMC was unable to pay contractors on time leading to them delaying several works.
 
 He also blamed the state government for NMC’s poor financial condition. “The government should have taken steps to make NMC more autonomous. Instead, it made the civic body completely dependent on itself by abolishing LBT. The abolition of LBT has failed to benefit citizens,” Arya said. 
 
 He also blamed privatizing of civic services for NMC's financial condition. According to him, BJP-led NMC favoured privatization of many important works. Citing example of water supply, he said privatization failed to improve the service and instead has been resulting in a loss of over Rs 100 crore per annum.
 
 Arya submitted a memorandum to the municipal commissioner and urged to improve civic body’s income.
