Ok, we have to confess that we are loving the fact that our   celebs are now letting loose and opening up on never-before-mentioned facts. So this week, it is Bong beauty   and funnyman   who caught our attention with their confessions. And the programme they were on was a cracker, we hear, owing to Andrita’s candid talk. From confessing about her relationship with   (about time girl, it’s been a decade now!), to sharing some eye-popping thoughts on industry colleagues (especially the ladies) Aindrita was a pataka, alright. She also took home the hamper later that night and deservedly so.
 As for Danish Sait, the new kid on the block in Sandalwood, stuck to politically-correct answers for all questions related to politics as well as the industry. Sample this: When host   asked him what quality of CM Siddaramaiah, he’d like to borrow, Danish said, “his resolve as he was back in office a day after losing his son.” And on Kannada films, the Humble Politician hero quipped, “I’d like to have 1/3 of the fan base of Sudeep, Darshan, Shivarajkumar and Puneeth anna.” Learnt the tricks of the trade, have we?
