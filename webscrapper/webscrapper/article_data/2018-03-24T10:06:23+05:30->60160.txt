PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The civic body is set to modify its   policy for maximum utilization of infrastructure and ensure benefits for the citizens and more glory for the city.

 Eknath Pawar, ruling party leader in the  , said the decision was taken during a meeting recently held by civic chief   with sports department officials. 
 
 Pawar said the civic body has built 128 gymnasiums, 12 swimming pools, hockey polygrass ground, several stadiums, badminton courts and other sports infrastructure. “It spends Rs 4.5 crore every year on operations and maintenance of swimming pools, while 29 gymnasiusm are run by the civic staffers,” he said.
 
 The remaining 99 gymnasiums have been given to private organizations. “We want these gymnasiums to have modern facilities. The civic body can earn some revenue if these facilities are given to some private organizations on contract,” he said. 
 
 Altogether 15 sports teachers were transferred to the election department before the 2017 Lok Sabha polls. “There are no sports teachers in the civic municipal schools now. These 15 sports teachers will be taken back,” Pawar said, adding that services of sportspersons such as archer   would be taken to train the students.
