HYDERABAD: Two students from the city, who went to Saudi Arabia to visit their father employed there, are stranded since June 2016 and are unable to return to pursue their studies because of a peculiar problem.

 The company their father Mohammad   is employed with has not renewed his ‘iqama’ (work permit) and therefore, the family got stuck there. Not just Rehman, at least 20 other Indians from Telangana, Maharashtra, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar, employed with Al Badr Hotel in Jeddah are facing a similar problem.
 
 The hotel ran into financial problems and the passports of Rehman, his wife and two daughters now lie with his employer. Besides, the employer did not pay his salary. The 60-year-old stopped going to work from January 1.
 
 Fatima  , 22, had taken admission in a college for her M Com. Her sister Farheen, 19, had finished her Intermediate first year.
 
 Both of them, who went along with their mother  , 51, planned to return in three months. Rehman was with this hotel for the last 37 years.
 
 “I want to come back to Hyderabad and appear for my Intermediate second year examinations,” Farheen told TOI. She also made an appeal to external affairs minister   for help. The examinations are scheduled to begin in March. She even urged the minister if it would be possible for her to take the exams in Saudi Arabia. This has been the situation for the last 18 months.
 
 Though a case has been filed in the labour court about salary arrears, the problem has not been solved for the last two years. Farheen said that the family had also approached the   in Jeddah. The labour court case will come up for hearing on March 5.
