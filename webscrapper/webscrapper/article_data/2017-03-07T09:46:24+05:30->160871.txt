BENGALURU: Energy minister   on Monday said he was ready for a probe or debate on any platform with the BJP. He was speaking in reference to the allegations made by BJP party legislators S   and C T Ravi that he was favouring a   by ensuring the   (KPC) bought coal from her coal mine in Indonesia.

 Kumar, however, laid down a condition for the debate. He said he was prepared to debate with BJP members who had handled the power portfolio during their rule in Karnataka, and not with any “lightweights”. Virtually dismissing Suresh Kumar and Ravi as not being of his stature, Kumar said, “I should be speaking to people of my level so that the discussions carry weight.” 
 
 On March 2, the two   charged Congress   with owning a coal mine in Indonesia, through which they said the KPC was purchasing coal for its thermal power projects.
 
 Kumar said that after he took over as the energy minister, the KPC was procuring coal from MSTC, a government of India enterprise. “And we are not concerned from where MSTC sources its coal,” he added.
 
 Regarding BJP’s allegation, Kumar, without naming Hebbalkar, said he had asked the “Congress party worker’’ about the same and the person denied owning any coal mine in Indonesia. In fact, the member is prepared to gift the coal mine to the BJP if it can support the charges with documents, he added.
 
 Going on the offensive, Kumar said he came into public life not to do short-term politics. “I am looking at a longer innings. I entered politics in 1989 and gradually climbed the ladder before I could reach the third floor of Vidhana Soudha. This has taught me to be wary at every stage, as I have a responsibility towards my political future, the party and the government,” he said.
 
 Dismissing allegations of lack in transparency in solar power projects, Kumar said the Centre had itself appreciated the same as the best model.
