MUMBAI: The special investigation team (SIT), which conducted an inquiry into   due to inhalation of   in the  , said that 12,300 cultivators used pesticides in a bid to kill themselves and over 680 died in 20 months in 2016 and 2017.

 The SIT submitted its report December 2017.
 
 The probe panel covered areas of Akola, Washim, Buldhana, Amravati and Yavatmal districts. State agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar told TOI that an awareness programme is being carried out and it will continue in future.
 
 Kishor Tiwari, an activist from Vidarbha working on agrarian issues, demanded that pesticides be banned in all villages. “Pesticides are easily available and hence used by farmers to end their life. There are other side-effects of pesticides as it goes into the body,” said Tiwari.
  
  
 He also slammed the bureaucracy and politicians for not doing enough. “Farmers’ suicides are a serious issue and farmers are feeling anxious because of a tardy bureaucracy and an ineffective minister,” said Tiwari. A senior agriculture department official said that the state has already initiated action and about nine FIRs registered against dealers in Yavatmal. Moreover, stocks of six companies and five dealers were seized and legal action initiated against the errant manufacturers and dealers across the state. More than 40 farmers had died due to pesticide inhalation last year after which the state government appointed the SIT to probe the matter. The SIT report was not made public and the Bombay high court’s Nagpur bench slammed the government for “suppressing the findings”.
