NEW DELHI: Students applying at   from this academic session can now study   and get their degrees from the university as a school coordination committee of the newly constituted School for   and Indic Studies recently approved several courses, including BA in Sanskrit —   and offline.

 The committee has also approved courses such as MA in yoga; BSc and MSc in ayurveda biology. There are also plans to include Sanskrit theatre, Sanskrit translation app development, Sanskrit computation, Sanskrit tourism, manuscript handling and other certificate and diploma courses.
 
 JNU’s Special Centre for Sanskrit Studies (SCSS) was converted into School for Sanskrit and Indic Studies after approval from the academic council (AC) in December last year. With the conversion, the centre will be seeing a major overhaul — both in infrastructure and academics.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Girish Nath Jha, chairperson of SCSS, said that they have been trying for a school for long as the centre too “was built after a long struggle.” 
 
 The courses are now awaiting approval from the executive council.
