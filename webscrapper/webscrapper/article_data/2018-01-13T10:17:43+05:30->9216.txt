BENGALURU: The last date for inclusion of names in the electoral rolls for the upcoming assembly polls has been extended to January 22.

 Karnataka chief electoral officer   told reporters on Friday: “The previous deadline to get names included in the voters’ list was January 12. But some political parties and district deputy commissioners have sought an extension as more people are yet to enrol. This will be the last chance and we appeal to the people not to miss this opportunity to register.”
 
 Those who are 18 years of age as on January 1, 2018, are eligible to enrol. Forms can be downloaded from the   ( ) website and submitted to the electoral registration officers or BangaloreOne centres. The commission is working out strategies to collaborate with college authorities and appoint campus ambassadors to maximize enrolment of youth.
 
 Kumar said a house-tohouse special drive will be undertaken by booth-level officers to collect details of persons to be enrolled and also removed. He appealed to political parties to appoint booth-level agents and help the authorities revise the rolls by providing information on voters who are dead or have moved out. The final date for publication of electoral rolls is February 28.
 
 Kumar said the ECI has suggested that polls be held in a single phase. “We are capable of conducting polls in a single phase and no political party has given any representation for elections to be held in two phases. Moreover, single phase will eliminate the probability of people jumping places to vote.”
