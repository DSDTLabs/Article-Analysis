NEW DELHI: Around 70 BJP  , including south and east Delhi mayors, were   outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s house on Friday morning for holding a  , demanding release of funds to the civic bodies under the Fourth Finance Commission recommendations.

 The protestors, including east Delhi mayor Satya Sharma and south Delhi mayor Shyam Sharma, wanted to meet Kejriwal who was not in the city. They insisted on meeting any official or minister on Kejriwal’s behalf and started the protest when nobody came. The police had to detain some of the protesters to stop the agitation.
 
 DCP (north) Jatin Narwal said some of the protestors left the venue after police intervention. “The 70 councillors who refused to leave the site were detained,” Narwal said. However, BJP office claimed that 120 councillors were detained by the police. All of them were released after half an hour.
 
 Armed with placards and banners, the councillors reached Kejriwal’s house led by  , leader of house, South Corporation. 
 
 The detention drew sharp reactions from BJP leaders.   chief Manoj Tiwari said, “The CM is evading from his responsibility towards the citizens of Delhi as he is busy campaigning in Punjab. BJP councillors have been trying to meet him to discuss the crisis. They have sought repeated appointments but all their requests have been ignored”.
 
 The civic bodies claimed that the Delhi government, apart from the Fourth Finance Commission recommendations, owes Rs 2,380 crores to the three civic bodies under the recommendations of the Third Finance Commission.
