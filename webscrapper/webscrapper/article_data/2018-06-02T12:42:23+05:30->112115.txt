  A day after BJP tasted defeat in   and Noorpur bypolls, Uttar Pradesh health minister and BJP’s Meerut district incharge   said, “Kairana and Noorpur bypolls were the election of arithmetic but Modi’s chemistry will certainly work in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. And you will see the results then.”
 
  Singh made this statement during his visit to Meerut on Saturday for a zila yojana meeting in which a budget worth Rs 380 crore was passed for the district.
  
  Meanwhile, hundreds of agitating farmers, too, reached the collectorate on Friday to meet the minister and pressed for their demand for payment of sugarcane dues.
  
  Attacking   and RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary who raked pending dues issue in their UP bypoll campaign, the minister said, “Our intentions are clear, but Akhilesh Yadav and Jayant Chaudhary are misleading masses on the payment issue. Let me be very clear. We paid Rs 10,500 crore pending sugarcane dues that pertained to 2014 to 2017. Similarly, we waived Rs 36,000 crore loans which was also a baggage of the previous government that we cleared. This year, we had 119 lakh tonnes of crop of cane as compared to 88 lakh tonnes in the previous year. Obviously, the pending amount will also swell. But we have already paid Rs 21,000 crore in the current year also. But we are committed to paying back to farmers and we are already doing that.”
