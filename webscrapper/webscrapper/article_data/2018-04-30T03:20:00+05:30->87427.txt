Margao: Opposition to the Regional Plan 2021 found an echo in the Colva gram sabha held on Sunday with the meeting passing a resolution declaring its support to the anti-PDA movement led by Goencho Avaaz.  Gram sabha members demanded that the new regional plan be prepared in a transparent manner in accordance with the spirit of participative planning.  Villagers also voiced concern over the sewage treatment plant coming up near the beach, as they fear raw sewage will find its way into the sea. Shack owners, watersports operators, and those dependent on tourism said the plant would affect their business. While the sewage treatment plant was initially designed to treat 1.5 million litres per day of sewage, it's capacity was later enhanced to treat 7.5MLD.  Speaking to TOI, Colva sarpanch, Antonio Fernandes, said, “The gram sabha passed a resolution that the panchayat send show cause notices to authorities for carrying out construction without taking approval from the panchayat. We will be issuing the notices soon.”.  The gram sabha also expressed strong opposition to the draft amendments to the gram sabha rules that no other matter beyond the agenda finalized for the meeting be taken up for discussions.
