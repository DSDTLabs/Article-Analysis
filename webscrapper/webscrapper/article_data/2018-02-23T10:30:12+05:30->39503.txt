JAIPUR: A circular issued by the  's Jaitran office in Pali district has brought much embarrassment to the   education department. 

 The circular, dated February 20, directs panchayat elementary education officers (PEEOs) to ensure that a booklet on the achievements of the BJP government in the state is distributed along with the mark sheets of students in government schools.
 
 Faced with severe criticism, the state government was forced to take a u-turn on the issue. After categorically denying that such an order had been issued, government officials on Thursday evening said that the "matter will be looked into".
 
 Naresh Pal Gangwar, principal secretary of education department, denied passing any such order. "Department can never issue a directive saying distribute booklets to 65 lakh students in the 69,000 government schools. I have asked the   director to look into the matter. There appears to be some confusion among officials at the district level, as the trend of distributing state communication exists but that is only among officials, and in some cases, teachers."
 
 Earlier, education minister Vasundev Devnani, while interacting with media persons at  , also denied such a circular had been issued.
 
 TOI has a copy of the order that was issued to Jaitharan block PEEOs directing them to access the enrollment of students in government schools and distribute the booklet accordingly. The order mentions that directions are being issued at the behest of the primary education council, Jaipur which had issued similar directions to district education officers on January 29.
