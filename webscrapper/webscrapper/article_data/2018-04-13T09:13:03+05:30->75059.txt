RAJKOT: Befriending a man on a social networking site has proved to be nothing less than a nightmare for a 27-year-old woman from  . Not only did the man from Rajkot allegedly rape her several times by making false marriage promises but he was also responsible for the woman’s engagement being called off. 

 Unable to take the mental torture anymore, the woman who lives in   area of Jamnagar approached the police and lodged a complaint against Hardik   (30), who lives in   area on Raiya Road in Rajkot city. 
 
 Around one-and-a-half years ago, Pandya had befriended the woman and promised to marry her. On this pretext, he raped her several times and clicked her obscene pictures too. Few months ago, the woman got an inkling that Hardik was not interested in marriage but only sexual relations. 
 
 When confronted him, Hardik demanded Rs 3 lakh and threatened to upload her pictures on Facebook if she did not pay up. However, the woman did not give in to his demand for money and completely broke relationship with him.
 
 R G Jadeja, police inspector at Jamnagar B-division police station, said that the woman then got formally engaged with another person. However, a week ago, the engagement was called off after Pandya uploaded her obscene pictures on Facebook.
 
 Pandya then again called her and asked the woman to engage in physical relationship. “He threatened to kill her parents if she did not give in to his demands,” Jadeja said.
 
 Police are yet to arrest the accused.
