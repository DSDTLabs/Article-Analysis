MUMBAI: The court conducting the trial in the Khawaja Yunus custody death case said that the former special public prosecutor’s   seeking to make four more   officials accused in the case will be kept pending until the victim’s mother’s   before the Supreme Court on a related issue is decided.

 Yunus’s mother Asiya had moved the Supreme Court after the Bombay high court had dismissed her plea challenging the government decision to refuse sanction to prosecute the police officials.
 
 The four police   against whom former   Dhiraj Mirajkar had moved the plea are Praful Bhosale, who is retired, Hemant Desai, Rajaram Vhanmane and Ashok Khot. 
 
 The police officials too moved a plea before a trial court opposing the application. In their plea, seeking the dismissal of the prosecution’s application, the officers said that in a letter dated October 6, 2010, the state government informed the DGP that sanction to prosecute them in the case had been refused. 
 
 The police officers said that the letter also said that the state had analysed the material and subsequently refused sanction for the accused to be chargesheeted. The police officials’ plea further stated that on April 10, 2012, the Bombay high court dismissed Yunus’ mother Asiya’s plea challenging the government decision to refuse sanction to prosecute them.
 
 Their defence said that the application sought to interfere in the administration of justice and was like a sword hanging over their heads. They said that the well reasoned order of the high court was binding.
