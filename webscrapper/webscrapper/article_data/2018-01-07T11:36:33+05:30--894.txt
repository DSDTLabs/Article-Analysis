AHMEDABAD: The designated   trying the sensitive   has rejected the state government’s demand to ban media coverage of proceedings when 26 secret witnesses depose.

 While special judge   refused to conduct   to ensure a fair trial, he ordered that the   or star witnesses must not be revealed in mass media.
 
 The government requested the court to prohibit the media from reporting the depositions of the secret witnesses, citing security concerns for them.
 
 The prosecution’s demand was strongly opposed by the defence attorneys. They argued that chargesheets were filed nine years ago, and 955 witnesses have been examined so far, but there was no complaint from the secret witnesses about security issues. They also argued that these witnesses were no more secret witnesses, as the court had ordered the prosecution to supply information about their identity to the accused. Thus, are all known to the accused and cannot be termed secret witnesses.
 
 The prosecution countered this argument by submitting that though the trial had been under way for so long, the identity of all 26 secret witnesses was never revealed.
 
 After hearing the arguments, the court earlier this week refused to ban news reporting of the proceedings. It took into consideration the submission of the defence that the trial would not appear fair if proceedings were held in-camera. This was also because the proceedings are attended by family members of the accused persons.
 
 The court concluded that the purpose of the secrecy of the star witnesses would be served best by not allowing their names to be revealed in news reports.
