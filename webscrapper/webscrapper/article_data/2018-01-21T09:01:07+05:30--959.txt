A day after a Class XI student committed suicide by hanging from the ceiling of his hostel room at Tiruchengode in  , his kin on Saturday didn’t allow doctors to perform postmortem demanding action against school authorities, who they said might have scolded the boy for not paying the term fees, forcing him to take the extreme step.

 The deceased was identified as Vritheeswaran, 17, son of Balamurugan-Jayasurya couple of   village near Panruti in   district. A student of Vidyabharathi Matriculation Higher Secondary School at Chakkrampalayam near Tiruchengode,   had returned to the hostel after the Pongal holidays only at 3.30pm on Friday.
 
 When his roommates returned from the school, they found that the door was locked from inside. They informed hostel warden Vijayakumar, who peeped through the door gap and found Vritheeswaran hanging from the ceiling. He immediately alerted the school management who then informed the Elachipalayam police. The police broke open the door and retrieved the body from the ceiling. They also registered a case under Section 174 of CrPC and initiated inquiry.
 
 The police informed Vritheeswaran’s parents, who reached the school on Friday night. The kin of the deceased alleged that the school management might have scolded him for not paying the term fees and that might have forced him to end his life. “We had to pay Rs 50,000, including hostel fee,”  , a farmer said.
