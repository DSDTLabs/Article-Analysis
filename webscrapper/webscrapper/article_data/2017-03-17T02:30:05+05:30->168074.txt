NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish   on Thursday said that he had asked for   exemption for educational and low-budget cinema during a meeting of the GST council.

 “I have raised the issue in GST Council. If we don’t provide tax relief to low-budget and educational cinema, they will cease to exist. I’ve requested GST Council to consider the cinema tax exemption issue seriously. It is important not only for industry but for society as well,” he tweeted.
 
 Earlier in the day, while addressing CII’s Delhi State Annual Session, Sisodia said, “Delhi has a large segment of semi-formal establishments which may face a lot of issues while transitioning to GST. With respect to this, I would like   to help us set up a dedicated cell, with a call centre as part of it, to assist traders and industrialists with the modalities of GST. This will help us understand the problems which we can then take up with the GST council.”
 
 Sisodia also asked CII to help the government set up skill centres for which he has offered space in government schools in the evening, once regular classes are over for the day. Responding to CII’s demand that skill training was essential for job creation, Sisodia said that the industry should step forward and even devise the syllabus based on the requirements of the day. 
 
  Sisodia added, “Pollution abatement is the government’s job but it also provides the industry with an opportunity. There are several issues where the industry can be roped in, including development in unauthorised colonies, waste collection and sanitation. We can deal with these issues in a partnership with the industry.”
