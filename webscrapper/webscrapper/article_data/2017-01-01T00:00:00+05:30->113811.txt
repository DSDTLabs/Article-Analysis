The style trends to rule the ramp and your wardrobe this year...

 
 Loungewear was big in 2016 and the trend continues in 2017. But this time it’s all about robes, which is having a fashion moment right now. If you don’t feel like dressing up, put on that upmarket robe and step out in style. 
 
  The cosy staple comes in shapes that are inspired by menswear or sporty styles or in a kimono avatar. 
 
 
 
 If you are obsessed with off-shoulder or cold-shoulder, take it to the next level with asymmetry. Yes, shoulder cutouts have got an epic update. 
 
  Strategic cutouts are impressive, innovative and impactful. 
 
 
 
 With designers like Balmian, Creatures of Comfort, Public School, and Marni showcasing stand-out military-style pieces on the runway, it is certainly likely to rule our wardrobes this season.
 
  It’s trans-seasonal, versatile and great for all skin tones. What’s more, the darker tone of khaki has a slimming effect, too! 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Whether it’s a high-waist skirt, a pair of low-waist trousers, or a coat dress, update your ensemble with a sharp and dramatic foldover waist or a thick strap of a waist-cinching belt. 
 
 Apt for both workwear and weekend outings.
 
 
 
 A smart combination of muffler and stole, a sash is the new must-have for 2017. With designers like Victoria Beckham, Thakoon and Tibi introducing eccentric versions of this accessory, it’s easy to pick your style. 
 
  Instantly adds a sassy twist to any silhouette, provided you choose the right colour and fabric. Stick to light fabrics for summer, go for warm woollens in winter.
 
 
 
 According to a report by an international retail analytic firm, 1980s-inspired clothing will gain momentum this year. The decade of Blondie, statement bell sleeves, big hair, shoulder pads, power suits, slouchy tailored trousers, denim skirts, distressed jersey tops, ruffles and flares will be welcomed in a grand way — and through effortlessly-wearable pieces.
