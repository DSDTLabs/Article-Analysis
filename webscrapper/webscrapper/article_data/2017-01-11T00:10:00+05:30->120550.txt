MUMBAI: Close to a lakh stakeholders have given feedback to the Union ministry of health and family welfare on the proposed exit test for medical students. The ministry had unveiled the draft   (Amendment) Bill 2016 in the last week of December and had sought suggestions from stakeholders. 

 In all, 98,031 mails were received by the ministry till January 6, the last date for feedback. Suggestions included scrapping reservation for medical officers, supporting and opposing combined   and  , and many also wrote opposing the National Exit Test (NEXT) itself.
 
 A department of health and family welfare official said several mails are carbon copies of each other sent from different email IDs, adding to the volume of feedback. “Since the feedback is the same, we will try to sort it out first and then decide the action,” said the official. The official hinted that suggestions from people opposing NEXT may not be considered, as the government is keen on an exit test. “There are many apprehensions about the test among stakeholders as they have not read the draft bill carefully. Several states, including Maharashtra, have a reservation for medical officers. We are making a provision of the reservation up to 50%, it is not mandatory,” said the official.
 
 The suggestions will be processed and a modified bill is likely to be placed in Parliament before the Act comes into force. Many medical students from Maharashtra had opposed the reservation policy and the concept of an exit test. “An additional test will burden students,” said a parent. While most parents and students were in favour of a combined counselling at state level to avoid the chaos of running to 10 institutes, some have even opposed it, said the department official.
