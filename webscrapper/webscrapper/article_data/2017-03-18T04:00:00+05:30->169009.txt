Mumbai: In a relief to   Bank’s former chairman  , and deputy MD B K Batra, the Bombay high court on Friday granted them bail in the Rs 1,300-crore loan default case involving Vijay Mallya’s defunct  . “The case rests on documentary evidence and there would be no question of tampering of evidence more so since both have retired,’’ said Justice Sadhana Jadhav who ordered their release from jail on a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh each with one or more surety of like amount. The judge also granted them a provisional cash bail for four weeks. They have to deposit their passports with   and mark their presence on the first Sunday of each month till framing of charges. Besides, the HC said, “the CBI cannot seek their custody after initial 15 days in judicial custody.’’ Both were behind bars since January 23. The   (CBI) registered a case in 2015 against them and this January chargesheeted them for colluding with Mallya and   chief financial officer and co-accused A Raghunathan for granting the airline loans worth Rs 1,300 crore in 2009 “without satisfying the corporate loan policy of the bank”.

 A special trial judge H S Mahajan had last month rejected their bail plea while granting it to six others, mostly other bank officials of a rank lower than theirs. The trial court had also denied Radhunathan bail and he last week moved the special court again for bail on the grounds that no further probe is on and his continued custody is unwarranted.
