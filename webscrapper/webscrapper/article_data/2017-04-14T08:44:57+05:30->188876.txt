AMRITSAR: Sikh residents of Canada’s   province got a Baisakhi gift in form of exemption from wearing helmets while riding off highway vehicles (OHV). Alberta rules define OHVs as all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), snowmobiles, dirt bikes, utility terrain vehicles, and side-by-sides.

 Legal counsel, World Sikh Organization of Canada, Balpreet Singh   told TOI on Thursday, “After listening to concerns of the Sikh community about the compatibility of off-highway vehicle (OHV) helmets with turbans, the law was written to exempt members of the Sikh religion who wear a turban.”
 
 While welcoming the exemption for turbaned Sikhs in Alberta’s amendments to the Traffic Safety Act and Off-Highway Vehicle Regulation, Boparai said initially, exemptions to the helmet requirement were announced that did not include turbaned Sikhs.
 
 “The WSO, along with other representatives of the Sikh community, were consulted in Edmonton on February 27 and Calgary on March 1 regarding the helmet requirements. We made submissions with respect to the importance of exempting turbaned Sikhs from mandatory helmet requirements,” he said.
 
  36, an Act to enhance OHV safety makes helmets mandatory for those riding OHVs on public lands. “The law will go into effect May 15, which sets fine amounts for those in violation of the helmet requirements,” he said.
 
 WSO Alberta unit vice-president Tejinder Singh Sidhu said, “We are pleased that the government of Alberta has listened to the voice of the Sikh community and exempted turbaned Sikhs from OHV helmet requirements. We are glad the government took the time to engage in dialogue with the community and to understand our concerns and has arrived at a decision that provides religious accommodation to turbaned Sikhs who cannot wear helmets while riding OHVs.”
 
 Earlier in 2013, Alberta became the first province of Canada bringing a policy to allow Sikhs to wear ceremonial kirpan – one of five articles of faith of Sikhs.
