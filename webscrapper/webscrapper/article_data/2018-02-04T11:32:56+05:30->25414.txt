KOCHI: Keeping with its promise to empower  ,   is now helping them to become small entrepreneurs. 

 As a first step, they have helped two transgender people to set up a fruit and fresh centre at   collectorate. 
 
 Amrutha and   belonging to the community have started the kiosk.
 
  "We would like to thank Kudumbashree officials and   administration for giving us an opportunity to run this kiosk. Since we are transgenders, we have to struggle a lot to eke out a living as no one is ready to give us jobs. This is a golden opportunity for us as we don't have to run from pillar to post seeking a job or alms," they said.
 
 District collector   inaugurated the juice corner on Friday. Kudumbashree officials said that only healthy fruit drinks will be supplied through the kiosk. 
 
 "We have come across our own colleagues and people who come to collectorate often seeking for fresh fruit juices in and around collectorate and most of the time they have to go out if they need one. The demand for fresh juices usually goes up during summer season," said an official with the Kudumbashree district mission.
 
 While the kiosk will be a relief to those coming to the collectorate, for Amrutha and Sajana, it is much more as they have finally found a job of their own to support them.
