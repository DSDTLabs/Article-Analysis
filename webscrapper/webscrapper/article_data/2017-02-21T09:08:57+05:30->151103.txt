NASHIK: An additional freight train will now run from here to ferry the   to other parts of the country.

 Currently, the   provides three rakes daily while the   provides one rake to transport onions.
 
 This additional rake will help farmers earn better from the crop. The farmers have had a bumper crop this year, in comparison to the last three years.
 
 The provision for a new rake comes after the meeting between the and district administration of railway officials, where the former demanded for more rakes to supply onions.
 
 Unlike the existing system where all the   laden goods trains head to Fatuha (Fatwa) junction in Bihar for unloading, the harvest will now be taken to Sitapur, Ranipatra, Dankuni and Malda. The rakes usually carry onion from Niphad, Kherwadi, Manmad, Lasalgaon, Dhule, Chalisgaon, Nandgaon and Nashik. 
 
 An official of the Bhusawal Division of Central   said that it has been decided that the number of rakes to carry onions will only be four from now.
 
 “We will have the rakes as ordered by the minister, but it is likely that if the turnaround time takes longer, then the situation will be difficult,” a railway official said.
 
 The onion merchants have welcome the move of the Central Railways. An onion merchant,   said, “Since the Railways are now ready to take the onions to other destinations, we have decided to book the goods for different places instead of just focussing on Fatuha.”
 
 The new rake will enhance the carrying capacity of the onions by 30%.
