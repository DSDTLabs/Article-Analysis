IMPHAL: Manipur erupted in joy over the selection of midfielder Kiyam   as Indian captain for the FIFA Under-17 World Cup which begins on October 6.

 The euphoria of Amarjit's poor family at the nondescript Haokha Mamang Leikai village in Thoubal district can be put in context when his parents reveal their struggles to send him to the level he is at today. Amarjit's father Kiyam Chandramani Singh and mother Ashangbi Devi, who earn a living for themselves and three children doing whatever job is available at a certain point of time, categorically said today's glory is the result of the iron determination of their son.
 
 Chandramani, a farmer, also works as a carpenter during offseason, while Ashangbi sells dry fish in small quantity in the Manipuri capital. Youngest among three siblings, Amarjit is a student of   (CFA). Notably, Amarjit's elder brother Umakanta , a footballer, is an alumnus of CFA, too.
 
 “I'm so happy that my son Amarjit will lead India in the World Cup. He is a hard-working boy and I'm hoping he scripts a success story for India,” an emotional Chandramani told TOI.
 
 “We don't have our own land and I grow paddy for others, do carpentry during off season. With our hard-earned money we found it hard to bring up our children but they are very determined in their respective fields. Today Amarjit is reaping the reward for his hard work,” Chandramani remarked.
 
 Echoing him, wife Ashangbi Devi quipped, “The Almighty has seen our struggle and has blessed our son Amarjit.”
 
 Jackson Singh, a close relative of Amarjit from the same locality, is also among the nine players in the under-17 squad from Manipur. Amarjit and Jackson joined the CFA together in 2011, Chandramani said.
