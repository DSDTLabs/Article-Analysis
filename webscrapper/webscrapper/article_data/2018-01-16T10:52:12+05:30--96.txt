INDORE: The   of   on Monday granted four months to Dhar district collector to complete the action against   causing pollution in the district.

 Division bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice Virendra Singh issued the directives while disposing of a PIL filed by Devendra Verma, a resident of Dharampuri village in Dhar. 
 
 The petition had initially raised the issue that a company carrying out mining and blasting work in their village was operating outside its allotted area, in close proximity to school and residential colonies, causing cracks in their residences, air, noise, soil and water pollution. It was causing problems to them. The gram panchayat in the village also had passed a resolution banning Jagdish Rai and Company from carrying out mining work in the village.
 
 In their reply, the district administration said that they were carrying out inspection of the mining company and in November 2017, the machinery of the company was sealed by   after the company was found flouting norms and encroaching on government land. 
 
 The pollution control board had also submitted its report pointing out towards the deficiencies in the plant. 
 
 The collector had initiated action against the one company made respondent to the petition and during the course of action, had found five other companies flouting norms against whom the action was taken. 
 
 “Though the petition was disposed of, the reliefs that were sought in the petition were taken up by the district administration and action was taken by them against the erring company. Hence the petition was disposed of by the court without costs,” petitioner’s advocate Kuldeep Pathak said.
