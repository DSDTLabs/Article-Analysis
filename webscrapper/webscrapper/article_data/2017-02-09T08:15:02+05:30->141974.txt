KOCHI: The high court has granted anticipatory bail to a 70-year-old widower who is accused of having had a sexual relationship with a 54-year-old widow after making her believe that he married her by the tying of a white thread around her neck. 

 A single bench of the court granted bail to   of Perumanoor   in a case registered at   at Thiruvananthapuram last year.
 
 On a complaint filed by the widow stating that the accused made her believe that he had married her lawfully, which resulted in sexual intercourse between them, police had registered the case for rape, cheating, cohabitation caused by a man deceitfully inducing a belief of lawful marriage (Section 493 of IPC), and marriage ceremony fraudulently gone through without lawful marriage (Section 496).
 
 Upon learning that there was no legally-valid marriage, the woman had filed a petition before a magistrate, which was forwarded to police for investigation. The complaint had stated that when the woman told her difficulties to the accused, he had told her that he would marry her immediately and had tied a white thread around her neck making her believe that they were legally married.
 
 In the order granting anticipatory bail, the high court said a perusal of the complaint creates some doubts about the truthfulness of the allegations. "It is quite difficult to believe at this stage that the victim believed the words of the petitioner. Whether consent given by the victim for the sexual intercourse is vitiated is a question of fact. As of now, the allegations in the complaint can be accepted only with a pinch of salt. The petitioner is aged about 70 years," the order stated.
 
 Further, the court ordered that if the petitioner is arrested by police in connection with this case, he should be released on bail upon executing a bond of Rs 50,000. He has also been ordered to cooperate with the investigation and not to destroy or tamper with evidence.
