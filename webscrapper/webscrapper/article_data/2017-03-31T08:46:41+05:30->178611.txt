PUNE: A software professional from Kondhwa lodged a complaint on Wednesday alleging an unidentified person had duped him of Rs 40,703. 

 The fraud came to light after   (48) was sent an offer letter for a job in a Canadian firm and was called to a hotel in Hinjewadi for an interview. Deshmukh told TOI on Thursday that he had come across an online ad for the post of a software professional in September 2016. 
 
 He said, "A man impersonating as a HR manager from a private firm called me on numerous occasions and offered a job. I did not suspect the caller as the phone number was from  . He lured me to deposit Rs 40,703 in a bank account for medical examination, obtaining visa and purchasing flight ticket. He mailed me the offer letter and called me for an interview. I was told to pay a commission of Rs 2 lakh to him in three instalments after getting the job."
 
 "I transferred the money to the account via net banking in two instalments. After receiving the letter, I visited the hotel for the interview, but on reaching there, I found no one. I then realised I was cheated."
 
 Deshmukh said he called the man many times but he did not attend the calls. 
 
 "I then filed a complaint against the unidentified person with the   of the Pune police. The cell identified the caller's   (IMEI) number and transferred the case to the Kondhwa police station for action on Wednesday. Investigations have revealed that the money was transferred to a bank in Mumbai," Deshmukh added.
