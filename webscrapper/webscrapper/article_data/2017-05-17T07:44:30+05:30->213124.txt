HYDERABAD: A debt-ridden farmer attempted suicide by consuming pesticide near chief minister  's camp office at Begumpet on Tuesday. He survived the bid and was rushed to hospital, where his condition is said to be stable. 

 The victim has been identified as 31-year-old Ramapuram  , a cotton farmer from Alur village in Gattu mandal of   district.
 
 On Tuesday morning, security personnel at the CM's camp office at Begumpet noticed Mallesh vomiting at the bus stop near the security check point. During preliminary probe, police came to know that Mallesh had spent 4 lakh in the past few years to sink five borewells in his agricultural fields. "Mallesh borrowed the amount to sink borewells from money lenders and banks. Of the five bore ells, water was struck in only one well and Mallesh ended up in debts," the inspector said.
 
 Mallesh told police that he even applied for CM's relief fund to get some relief from the money lenders, but could not succeed in getting the money . The cotton crop in Mallesh's fields also failed due to lack of sufficient water, police said.
 
 Distraught with the mounting debts and deteriorating financial condition of his family, Mallesh decided to end his life in front of the CM's camp office and came to Hyderabad on Tuesday.
 
 Mallesh consumed pesticide at some distance away and walked towards the security check at the camp office. When he collapsed near the security check area, police noticed Mallesh. Mallesh's brother and his wife came to Gandhi Hospital and police have not registered any case against him yet.
