CHANDIGARH: The   government would launch a solar power-run micro irrigation pilot project under the   (PMKSY) in the state. Costing Rs 24.65 crore, it would be the first of its kind in the country to draw energy from solar power and the grid and would be connected to the nearest 11 KV line through a hotline to ensure an uninterrupted power supply.

 An official of the canal area development authority (CADA) said the foundation stone of the project had been laid by chief minister  . Additional power generated by solar power panels at the project would be supplied to the nearest power sub-station, which would be connected to a 24-hour plant of an 11 KV line.
 
 The CM would inaugurate the project in Gumthala Garhu Dera Fateh Singh village of   district on July 30. With a view to ensuring water supply to every farm, CADA has established this pilot project on micro irrigation under the PMKSY in the state. Haryana does not have a single perennial river in the state and two-thirds of the stateâ€™s underground water is saline. While the annual water consumption is increasing rapidly, the amount of available water is getting limited in the state.
 
 The Chief Minister, keeping in view the future water requirement in the state, had directed CADA to prepare a pilot project. With this scheme, farmers are likely to get fresh canal water for micro irrigation and this water could be utilized for drip and sprinkler irrigation system. It will not only reduce water consumption but also help with water availability to every farm. The CADA will provide opportunities for maximum use of available irrigation facilities to the farmers, the spokesman added.
