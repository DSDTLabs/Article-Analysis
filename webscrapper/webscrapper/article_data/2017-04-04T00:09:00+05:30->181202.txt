Indore: A food stall at platform number 4 of railway station was asked to shut down for taking extra money from passengers against food and beverages provided by it on Monday.

 Senior officials with railways said that there were complaints against the stall operator. After which a surprise inspection was conducted at food stall-Food Express- was by commercial department’s official. It was found that the stall operator had not pasted any rate list of food items, which he was selling. There should be at least two to three rate chart in two three places at the stall. 
 
 Since there was no rate chart for food and beverage items being sold at the stall, it is assumed that the stall operator was taking extra money from the passengers and visitors of the station, said sources. 
 
 The operator did not have medical certification of his staff working at the outlet. “Four employees were at the stall at the time of inspection, but, none of them had their medical certificates, which are issued by chief health inspector of the railways,” said officials. 
 
 Officials said that the stall has been closed down, and an inquiry has also been initiated against its operator.
