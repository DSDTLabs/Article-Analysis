HYDERABAD: Vice-President M   on Sunday expressed anguish over the events in Parliament and said there is no place for violence in legislatures. “Let us recall Gandhiji’s wise words: No perfect democracy is possible without perfect non-violence at the back of it. So, let us abjure violent emotions, violent speech and violent actions. Let us discuss, debate and decide in a dignified manner.”

 The VP’s comments assume significance against the backdrop of TDP and YSRC MPs raising a din in the Parliament over special category status and TRS MPs protesting with placards for justice to Telangana. Also, the   has recently expelled two Congress MLAs and suspended all the Congress legislators from the House for this budget session.
 
 
 Venkaiah urged legislators to argue with the force of logic and conviction rather than stall the proceedings through brute force. Stating that he was disturbed at the rising trends of unruly behaviour and   in the legislatures, Naidu stressed “We should move away from the current environment of settling scores in which each party adopts the strategy of ‘I disrupt because you have done it before.’ Can we end this spiral? I think we can and we should. Let us make a new beginning,” he said while addressing the first National Consultation Conference on “Swaraj to Suraj: Taking Forward the Governance Agenda’’ in Hyderabad on Sunday.
 
 Seeking to remind the MPs and MLAs of their responsibility of ensuring the accountability of the Executive which includes good governance, Naidu said that colonial rulers were blamed for everything going wrong then, but there is no such excuse under Swaraj and the Parliament needs to emerge as a role model by setting high standards of performance and ensuring good governance.
