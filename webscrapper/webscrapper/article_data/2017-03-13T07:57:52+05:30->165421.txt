Celebrating his victory and also his birthday on Sunday, MLA Balvinder Singh Bains said they will thank people of the constituency by working for their betterment and rights. He said the victory came as birthday greetings from people. 

 Balvinder Singh Bains of the LIP won with a huge margin of 30,917 votes, securing 53,955 votes. Bhupinder Sidhu of the Congress stood second with 23,038 votes and Hira Singh Gabria (SAD) stood third with 20,554 votes.
 
 Bains said both Simarjit and he started their day by seeking their parentsâ€™ blessings and working to resolve public grievances in their office. Listing issues on his agenda, he said they need to work in areas of health, education and security. He said while people may not have given them majority, they have enhanced their standing by raising their number from two (Bains brothers) to 22 (total number of seats won by LIP and AAP). 
 
 He also resolved to check the drug menace, corruption and unemployment, besides working for the development of the industry. According to Bains, they will support the Congress wholeheartedly on issues which are in the best interest of the state but will never enter into an alliance with the Congress party.
