AGRA: Unfazed by its recent defat in Delhi municipal elections,   is gearing up to contest UP civic polls in July. The party will highlight corruption in municipal bodies and will field candidates from wards where it feels it has support of the locals. These announcements were made by senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh who was on a day-long visit to Agra on Tuesday.
 
 “AAP will contest elections alone. After reviewing the situation in Purvanchal, Awadh and Braj regions, we will now assess Bundelkhand and western UP. We will consult our local leaders and based on their feedback, will announce our candidates for the civic bodies,” Singh said.
  
  “The party will make corruption in municipal bodies as its poll issue. We have earlier exposed corruption in Lucknow and Agra municipal bodies where corporators or councillors earned money from inflated house and water taxes. The party has learnt from its previous mistakes. We will soon be launching our manifesto,” he added.
  
 Speaking on the ongoing Kapil Mishra row, Singh said, “He is acting on behest of  . He threatens to approach   and   but fails to provide proof about his visit to   at a time when the CM was taking money from another party leader.”
