COIMBATORE: A 50-year-old man from Sethukuli in Thinnapatti village, who received a call on Monday morning informing him that his son had committed suicide in Singapore, has alleged   and demanded that the   investigate the death. On Tuesday, he petitioned the   seeking his intervention to bring his son’s body to his native town.

 Karumalai, a farmer from Thinnpatti village, about 80km from Salem, received a call from Singapore at 9am informing him that 27-year-old Venkatachalam K had hung himself. The caller did not give further details and hung up abruptly.
 
 Venkatachalam’s parents do not believe that he committed suicide. “He is not a coward. We feel that there is something fishy about our son’s death. We want the Indian government to initiate an enquiry into the matter,” said Karumalai.
 
 With the help of neighbours Karumalai approached the police, who advised him to meet the collector. “I met the collector on Tuesday morning. He has forwarded my petition to the authorities,” said Karumalai.
 
 Officials at the Salem collectorate asked Karumalai to approach a member of Parliament for help. “They told me that only if an   mounts pressure on the Centre, will there be any effort taken to bring my son’s body here,” said Karumalai. 
 
 He and his family met former MP Anbumani Ramadoss, who promised to help. “I received a call from an agency informing me that they will send the body to India. But I don’t trust them,” said Karumalai. He wants the Indian government to ensure that his son’s body reaches his home town.
 
 Venkatachalam is the eldest of three siblings. After completing his diploma in electrical engineering, he got a job in Singapore through an agency. “Three years ago, he left India to work with a   as an electrician. He recently visited his village on January 26 for his sister’s wedding. He returned to Singapore on February 6,” said Karumalai.
