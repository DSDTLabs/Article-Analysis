PATNA:Former general secretary and spokesperson of RJD, Ashok Sinha, announced his resignation from the primary membership of the party on Tuesday even though RJD’s chief spokesperson of the state, Shakti Singh Yadav, claimed he was expelled six months ago.

 “RJD has become irrelevant and it was better to leave the party respectfully than to waste time. Tejashwi Yadav cannot lead the party like Lalu ji did as he does not have the basic understanding of the ideologies like social justice and quality, which are the mainstay of the party. Besides, seniors like Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Jagdanand Singh and Abdul Bari Siddiqui are waiting only for some electoral benefits, otherwise they will also leave the party in no time,” Sinha said.
