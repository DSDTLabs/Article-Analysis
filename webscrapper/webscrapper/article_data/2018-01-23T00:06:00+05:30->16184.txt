Mangaluru: Veteran Congress leader B Janardhan Poojary will release his autobiography ‘Saala Melada Sangrama’ at Kudroli Gokarnatha Temple here on January 26 at 5.30pm.

 The book is named after his loan mela for the economically poor as the Union minister of state for finance. The autobiography is in Kannada, English and Hindi. The book is published by Santhosh Kumar Poojary and Preetham Poojary.
 
 Speaking to reporters, Poojary said in the book he has documented every important issue he could remember, right from his younger days to his unplanned entry into politics and the rift in the party during the tenure of Devraj Urs as the chief minister of Karnataka to his present loner, almost sidelined status, in the grand old party.
 
 “I haven’t made any attempt to paint a holier than thou picture of myself neither do I intend to hurt anyone through my autobiography. I have documented the incidents as I have seen without striking a compromise with the truth,” Poojary said.
 
 Asked regarding the rumours that his own party men ensured his defeat in Lok Sabha elections for four times, Poojary said the issue also finds a mention in the autobiography which is written by writer Lakshmana Kodase as dictated by Poojary.
 
 He said the book currently has 210 pages classified into nine chapters. A few more pages are likely to be added. 
 
 Poojary said he would visit former Congress national president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to and hand them over copies of his autobiography.

 Poojary slammed the state government for transferring DK SP C H Sudheer Kumar Reddy. “Doesn’t chief minister Siddaramaiah understand that the bureaucrats too have families? Why are they being transferred within a few months of posting to a particular post? This is highly condemnable,” he said.
 
 About the rumours of district minister B Ramanath Rai using his influence to get the SP transferred, Poojary said if that was the case, Rai would learn a lesson in the upcoming polls.
