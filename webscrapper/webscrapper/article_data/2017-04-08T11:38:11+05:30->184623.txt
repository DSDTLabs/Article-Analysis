Bhabho is worried to see no customer turn up on her shop and stops the passerbyâ€™s who refuse to take jalebi's from her. She hears Baba sa call out her name from far and runs to her house in panic. The two come face to face and Baba sa gifts Bhabho a sari and insists her on wearing it then. She takes the sari and goes inside.
 
  Everyone talks about how they dread this moment. Bhabhi wears the sari and comes outside. Baba sa reveals that he has short term memory loss and remembers no one that well. He recalls what happened earlier and talks about how he broke all relations with Bhabho. Asking god for making him forget Bhabhi forever, Baba sa walks out from there. Bhabho goes inside and changes into the sari she was wearing earlier. She brings out the other sari and hands it back to babasa.
  
  
 
  
  Meena burns down the sari. She tells the maid that her house is separate from that of Bhabho's. She also tells her that only babasa, Golu and Vansh are in her family, the rest are in Bhabho's family.
  
  There is a division in the house. Meena reveals that Bhabho was on Sooraj's side even thought she knew that he was at fault. She says that it was Bhabho's stubborn nature because of which the family was divided into two.
