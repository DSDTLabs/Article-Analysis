MANGALURU: Non-availability of land is a major reason for not having a   in Mangaluru, said C Mallikarjuna, joint commissioner of transport and managing director, D Devaraj Urs Truck Terminal Limited, Bengaluru, here on Tuesday.

 Mallikarjuna was interacting with members of   and other stakeholders with regard to having a logistic park or truck terminal in  .
 
 Explaining the current scenario of truck parking in Mangaluru, especially on national highways, he said that the stretch between   and Nanthoor Junction and roads which connect to major cities have turned into parking lots for trucks. “We cannot blame the truckers for this menace as we have not created any infrastructure for them. Many fatal accidents have occurred in the past due to the practice of parking trucks on highways. The major reason for not having a truck terminal in Mangaluru like in Bengaluru, Mysuru and Hubballi- Dharwad is the lack of availability of land,” he said. 
 
 Mallikarjuna assured that if the government finds a suitable place in Mangaluru, soon the work of creating a logistic park will be commissioned. “The park or terminal will boost the economy besides easing traffic congestion in  ,” he added.
 
 Jeevan Saldanha, KCCI president, mentioned that every day thousands of trucks enter the city and culminate at Baikampady Industrial Area. Among them around 5,000 plus are Canters and trailers.
 
 During interaction, one of the stakeholders suggested that multiple terminals can be created at various exit points of the city in case there is a land issue to set up a big terminal in one place. Replying to the suggestion, Mallikarjuna pointed out that if truckers are ready to come to such terminals then this plan can be executed. “We should make sure that these truckers are comfortable with multiple terminals, otherwise it will turn out to be an unviable idea,” he added.
