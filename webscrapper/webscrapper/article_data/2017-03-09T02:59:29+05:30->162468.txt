NEW DELHI: Seeking to ensure transparency in granting clearances to projects in earmarked   in the country, the environment ministry turned digital on Wednesday by launching a dedicated website for managing the affairs of India's coastal regulation zone (CRZ). 

  Anil Madhav Dave said the portal would "promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in grant of  ".
 
 Coastal stretches of seas, bays, estuaries, creeks, rivers and backwaters, which are influenced by tidal action up to 500 metres from the High Tide Line (HTL) and land between the Low Tide Line (LTL) and HTL, are demarcated as CRZ where the government imposes restrictions on setting up and expansion of industries or other projects. 
 
 The portal is a web-based system for obtaining clearances required from the ministry under CRZ. It can be accessed through the ministry's website. 
 
 "The system will enable the project proponents and the concerned State/Union Territory bodies like the State Coastal Zone Management Authorities (SCZMAs) and municipal/town planning agencies in tracking the status of their proposals," said an official.
 
 The user-friendly portal enables submission of applications for CRZ clearance in a single-window interface and facilitates quick flow of information related to CRZ clearances.
