Working on a dark, psychedelic   number was never easy, says singer and actor  , whose latest video, Avyakta, has generated quite a buzz. The bilingual track (released in   and Hindi) is based on a concept that portrays the darker side of all individuals. “The video has been written and directed by Dipanjan Sanyal; it’s his concept and idea. It’s about a girl, who lost her mother at a young age and later goes on to be cop. However, since she also has a dark side, she falls in love with and kills the men she’s with,” says Shachina.

 But why produce a track that is so dark? “We were very skeptical about releasing a song like this in Kannada. We weren’t sure how people will react to it. My earlier video was a very happy, peppy song, but this one is in stark contrast to it. Initially, I was hesitant to do it, but we went ahead anyway. The director and   director were confident about it and they wanted to try it out,” she says. 
 
 Shachina says that a   rock number in Kannada is unusual, but she hopes that more people will follow suit. “The genre is psychedelic rock and we wanted to try it out for two reasons — one, because we wanted a rock song in Kannada. Other languages have so many songs and videos in different genres and we thought why not try something like this in Kannada, too. Two, because the concept needed it and the lyrics demanded it,” says Shachina. The song, which was shot over three days in Bengaluru, has Shachina not only lending her voice to it, but also acting in it. The video, says Shachina, is not about violence, but about destruction. “The song is about a person who is mentally unstable — that’s where the dark part lies. It’s about destruction and self-destruction. For e.g., take a look at criminals, see how they are conditioned. It’s not about violence, but about the destruction around you,” she sums up.
