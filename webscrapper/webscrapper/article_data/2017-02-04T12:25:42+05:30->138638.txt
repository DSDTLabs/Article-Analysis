  "If you are even doing trade through CPEC, you can reach out to any destination in China from this area. So, we are very hopeful and we continue to work to normalize our relations with India," the minister added.

  "We are hoping that by March, these state elections will be over and maybe then there will be a better environment to pursue peace talks with India," the minister said.
