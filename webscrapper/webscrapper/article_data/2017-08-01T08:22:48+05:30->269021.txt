AGARTALA: The   (IPFT) has criticised the Left Front government for turning down their request to hold a rally as part of the celebrations of World Indigenous Day on August 23. The IPFT has been celebrating the day as Tipraland Demand Day. 

 Police refused to grant permission to IPFT for holding a rally from   saying that the stadium has been already booked for a sports event, which IPFT considered as an attempt to humiliate it. 
 
 IPFT president   on Monday said, "Police allowed   to hold rallies on busy roads without considering the sufferings of people. In case of IPFT, police was partisan." 
 
 He argued that IPFT is political party registered with the   and doesn't have any record of subversive activities or undemocratic agenda. "Even then, the administration turned down our demand without suggesting an alternative place for the rally," he added.
