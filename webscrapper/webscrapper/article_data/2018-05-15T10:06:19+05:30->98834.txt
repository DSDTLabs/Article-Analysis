NAGPUR: Top seed   lived up to his form and reputation to pocket the Khasdar   tournament which concluded at the NIT Hall, Ashi Nagar, here on Monday.

 
 Om Krida Mandal's Jambhulkar rallied back to down Nikhil Lokhande of Janata Vachanalaya in three games to clinch the title. Jambhulkar did not have the best of starts as he lost the opening game by a solitary point (15-16). However, he bounced back strongly and pocketed the next two games 25-14, 25-7 to shatter the hopes of Lokhande.
 
 Earlier in the semifinals, Jambhulkar trounced AGRC's Raju Bhaisare 18-12, 25-2, while Lokhande notched up a hard-fought 25-19, 5-16, 25-0 win over Rai Club's Irshad Ahmad.
 
 City Police fail to turn up for third place tie
 
 Meanwhile, the third place play-off tie between City Police and   (YMFC) was marred by a controversy. The cops failed to turn up at the SECR Motibagh ground here on Monday and as a result the match was awarded to YMFC.
 
 Haresh Vora, NDFA president, said, “we made several announcements but the team didn’t turn up. Now the   organizing committee will have to decide whether a third prize of Rs 50,000 should be awarded to YMFC or not.”
 
 Asked whether NDFA will take an action against City Police, Vora said the organizing committee has already taken action by awarding the match to YMFC.
 
 Meanwhile, the final between GRC Kamptee and Rabbani Club will be played on Tuesday evening.
