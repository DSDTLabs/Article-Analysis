Vadodara: A judicial magistrate’s court sentenced a provision store owner to a simple imprisonment of six months and a fine of Rs 5,000 for selling adulterated moong dal from his shop in Makarpura.

 The then food inspector of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) L A Modi had purchased 750 grams moong dal from Hasmukh Patel’s shop in September 1993. The dal was then divided in equal quantity and sent to a public analyst and local health authority for examination.
 
 The public analyst in his report had said that the moong dal sample is adulterated and misbranded as the added colour in it was prohibited by the law. On the basis of the report, the local health authority of the civic body submitted complaint under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act.
 
 Patel’s lawyer argued in the court that there are no evidences that food inspector had cleaned or dried the bottles in which the mung dal was collected. However, advocate J S Pancholi, on behalf of the complainant, argued that the food inspector had followed all procedures of sampling, sealing and packing in accordance with the law.
 
 The court while sentencing the punishment to Patel observed that he had suffered a lot due to longevity of the proceedings for the last 24 years.
