TV and entertainment icon   said she once had to spell her name at a popular coffee shop. Winfrey sat down with her   co-stars   and   and opened up about the 'normal people' things they still do on a regular basis.

  
  
 According to reports, although Winfrey can't remember the last time she pumped her own gas, the 64-year-old said she will still get her own coffee. "Can you imagine writing 'Oprah' on a coffee cup?" Kaling asked, which prompted Winfrey to recall the last time she placed an order. 
 
 "Oh my God, I just went two days ago and the woman said, 'Name?' and I said, 'Oprah,' and she said, 'How do you spell that?'" The revelation sent the three actresses into laughter, but Winfrey wasn't the only one who struggled to get her name spelled correctly at the chain.
