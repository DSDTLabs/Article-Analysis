Panaji: The Congress will have to inform the high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday whether it would like to go before the speaker of the Goa legislative assembly for redressal of its petition filed against health minister Vishwajit Rane. The petition was adjourned till Wednesday after all parties concluded their arguments. Congress, the petitioner has sought disqualification of Rane as a MLA as mandated under the Constitution. Congress and its members has alleged that Rane had resigned as MLA from Valpoi seat to preclude the filing of disqualification petition against him before the speaker. Senior counsel Surendra Desai appearing for the Congress Party had argued that speaker has no jurisdiction to decide in this case. The speaker cannot examine this matter as Rane has resigned, he contended. Rane's lawyer had raised the issue of the jurisdiction of the high court to entertain disqualification plea saying the disqualification matter can be decided by the speaker. A petition filed by an independent MLA Prasad Gaonkar is before speaker Dr Pramod Sawant. It's the contention of the petitioners that Rane stood disqualified as a whip was issued to him to vote against the government's confidence motion-led by chief minister Manohar Parrikar. Without voting, he had walked out before tendering his resignation as Congress MLA to pro tem speaker Sidharth Kuncalienker.
