JAMMU/SRINAGAR: Two children were among three civilians killed, with at least 12 people injured, in heavy shelling by Pakistani forces along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu & Kashmir’s   district on Monday, the UN-mandated international day of non-violence.

 In Uri in   district, two militants were killed as they tried to infiltrate. Towards late evening four more terrorists were shot dead in Tangdhar, nearly 300 km from Uri, while trying to enter the country. An Army officer and four jawans were wounded in the firefight.
 
 “Nine-year-old Israr Ahmed and Shamim Akhter, 15, were killed in unprovoked shelling,” a police officer said. The identity of the third person killed wasn’t known.
 
 Poonch deputy commissioner Tariq Ahmed Zargar said, “Two children died while around 12 civilians were wounded in shelling from across the LoC,” adding that two critically injured civilians were airlifted to Jammu and two others taken to Jammu by road.
 
 A cop at Tangdhar said Lt Rahul Kumar was among four soldiers injured in the gunfight.
 
 While the officer and a soldier were admitted to military hospital Drugmulla, the two remaining injured jawans were airlifted to 92 Base Hospital at Badamibagh for specialized treatment. Another cop said, “The   this morning started heavy unprovoked firing at Indian posts and villages.” Much of the shelling took place in Dhigwar, Kerni and Shahpur sectors. Firing began early and stopped around noon. “Our troops manning the LoC retaliated effectively,” the cop added.
 
 Infiltrators were seen in Rampur in Uri sector, 110km from Srinagar, by Army personnel. Militants fired at the jawans resulting in a firefight. Three more were seen towards evening in Tangdhar and engaged in a firefight with cops later confirming that all three were killed.
 
 “The infiltrators were killed in a gunfight and weapons recovered,” Srinagar-based defence spokesman Col Rajesh Kalia said.
