Vadodara: The   ( ) general board will now decide on the project to supply treated sewage to the   Refinery of the   (IOC). The standing committee of the civic body passed on the proposal for the project to the board.

 IOC has proposed to lift treated sewage from the Chhani STP of the civic body. It plans to use 21 million litres of water per day as process water in the refinery. The VMC will have to sign a memorandum of understanding and an agreement in this regard with the IOC.
 
 IOC is not the only organisation looking to use STP water from VMC. The civic body has received a similar proposal from the   (GSEC) that has planned a power plant in the Shinor taluka.   has sought treated sewage to the tune of 110 million litres per day from the VMC.
 
 The standing committee stated that for any such future project other than that of IOC, the administration should approach it again.
