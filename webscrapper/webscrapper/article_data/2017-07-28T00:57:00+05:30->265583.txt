Coimbatore: Though it has been four months since Tamil Nadu chief minister Edapaddi K Palanisami inaugurated the country’s first insect museum at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (Tnau) here, the facility remains closed to visitors, thanks to the delay in setting up a ticket vending machine.

 Palanisami had inaugurated the museum in March, which was itself a delay as it was scheduled to be inaugurated by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa in 2015. But, the inauguration was postponed citing various reasons. Given the delay of nearly 15months, the government should have ensured that the museum is open for visitors immediately after the official inauguration. However, the varsity placed order for a ticket vending machine with a city-based company almost a month after the inauguration.
 
 “The procedures were followed and the company, after showing us a design, agreed to take the order. It gave us a quotation for manufacturing the machine,” said TNAU vice-chancellor K Ramasamy.
 
 However, after a few days, the university decided to modify the design. Tnau officials refused to comment about the details of modification. 
 
 “The company that got the contract to manufacture the machine had agreed to modify the design based on our demands. But, it demanded additional charges for the modification,” said a senior university official.
 
 While according to the company, the modification of the machine would incur additional expenses, university sources say that once a contract has been signed, the price cannot be changed. “However, based on discussions, it was decided that the company will provide the machine. We do not know the reason for the delay,” said the official.
 
 The company had promised to deliver the machine in 10 days on two occasion, Tnau officials said.
 
 While visitors are not allowed, Tnau is accommodating special guests and VIPs to visit the museum.
