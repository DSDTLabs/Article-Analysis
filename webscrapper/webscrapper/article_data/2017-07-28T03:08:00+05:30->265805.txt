Panaji: Former RSS sarsanghchalak Subhash Velingkar said that Goa Suraksha Manch (GSM) will contest the polls from both constituencies despite the party’s poor showing at the last elections.  “One must understand that GSM had just launched as a party before the February 2017 polls. It is not about winning or losing, it is about upholding our principles. As the other opposition parties are fumbling badly, we are here to offer a strong opposition,” said Velingkar. GSM president Anand Shirodkar said that the names of the party’s candidates for the bypolls are yet to be finalised.  “Our party workers everywhere feel Velingkar should contest from Panaji. But he has never been full-time into politics. We are yet to ask him. We have scheduled a series of meetings where the candidates will be finalised soon,” Shirodkar said. Velingkar, however, told TOI that he is not open to contesting the bypolls.  Shirodkar said that Raju Sukerkar, who was originally chosen by the GSM to contest Panaji in the February elections, is not being considered for the bypolls. “His health does not permit him to contest,” Shirodkar said. GSM had failed to win a single seat at the February 2017 assembly polls. Velingkar said GSM is treating the byelections as a preparatory ground for the party to contest the 2019 parliamentary and 2022 assembly polls.
