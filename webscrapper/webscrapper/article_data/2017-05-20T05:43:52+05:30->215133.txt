LUCKNOW: With just two days to go for the ‘No Helmet, No Fuel’ drive to begin,   have admitted that they were yet to be told how to enforce it. Speaking to TOI, general secretary of  , Sudhir Bora, said, “We are not supposed to enforce the law or take  . We can only issue a warning to first-time offenders.” 

  On Wednesday, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Deepak Kumar and the petrol pump dealers association had a meeting to enforce the law against bike riders who do not wear helmets. After a one-hour meeting, the SSP came out with the decision that people who did not wear helmets would not be eligible for   refill. 
 
 On Friday, TOI did a reality check of petrol pumps to see how pump management would deal with offenders. It was found that dealers were not equipped to deal with such a situation as they did not have any written communication from either the SSP or their association. According to the data received by Regional transport office (RTO), there were 14,80,458 two wheelers in Lucknow in 2016. The number has only shot up this year. While the district has 186 petrol pumps, there are more than 25 petrol pumps which have recorded high footfall of customers with two wheelers. 
 
 Mohammad Faiz, a city-based petrol dealer, confirmed there were no written orders regarding ‘No Helmet No fuel’. Similarly, Ankur, manager of a petrol pump in Hazratganj, said he too had no written orders from the SSP. Despite repeated attempts, SSP Deepak Kumar could not be contacted. However, his spokesperson said, “SOs and SHOs will be deployed at petrol pumps to counsel two-wheeler riders.”
