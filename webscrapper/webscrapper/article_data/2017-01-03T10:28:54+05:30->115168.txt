Everyone is worried as Ishwari goes missing after knowing the truth about Sona's pregnancy. Radha keeps taunting Sona and her parents. Sona's father says that Ishwari is behaving like a child. Dev and Bijoy also go into an argument.
 
  Sona is still looking for Ishwari and spots her at the Shiv temple. She pleads her to come back home but Ishwari refuses. Sona tries to convince her that even she did not know about this but Ishwari fails to believe.
  
  
 
  
  She tells Sona that she broke her trust and lied to her. Both of them cry but Ishwari refuses to go with Sonakshi.
  
  Sona comes back home and tells Dev that Ishwari is in the temple but is refusing to come back. Dev rushes to get her back.
  
  He requests her to forgive them. He also tells her that it was him who did all this. Sona got to know about this only a day before. He says he is at fault and bows his head before Ishwari.
