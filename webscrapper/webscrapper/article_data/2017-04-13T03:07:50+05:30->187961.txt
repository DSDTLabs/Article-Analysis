KOLKATA: The summer has barely set in. Yet, the city has already clocked a record number of   connections. In February and March, 14,000 people have applied for new AC connections, up from 11,000 that had applied in the corresponding period last year. The year before, only 6,000 had applied for ACs in these months. 

 With the meterological office predicting a harsh summer and less than regular monsoon, the number of applications for ACs could breach the 1 lakh mark this year, up from 70,000 that had poured in last year.
 
 Last summer, ACs accounted for nearly 500 MW load during the peak when temperature hovered around the 40°C mark. With one AC consuming approximately 2 KW power, it translates to 2.5 lakh ACs in operation last year. If 1 lakh ACs are added this year, the combined AC load will go up to 650-700 MW. That is as much power generated by Budge Budge thermal power station. 
 
 “The start to this year’s summer has been harsher, triggering a demand surge. If the trend continues, a record number of applications will come in this year,” said   vice-president (distribution) Avijit Ghosh.
 
 Apart from online applications, consumers can also call the CESC call centre at 1912 to make the application over phone. “We have simplified the application process. If the meter does not require an upgrade, the customer will be told to go ahead with the installation. If not, the meter will be upgraded within 48 hours,” he said.
 
 Interestingly, half the applicants have chosen the e-service route. Also, 30% of the consumers or 7.46 lakh people opted to pay their bills online. “In March 2015, e-wallet usage was less than 1%. That has shot up to 30% in March 2017,” Ghosh pointed out. 
 
  The utility installed two novel substations to meet the growing power demand in congested areas — an underground sub-station in Park Circus and a containerised GIS sub-station in Nager Bazar.
