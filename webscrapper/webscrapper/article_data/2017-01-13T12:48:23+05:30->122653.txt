PANAJI: The   (AAP) in Goa on Thursday extended their support to   contesting from Priol. Gaude is a known leader of the   (ST) and enjoys large support base in the constituency.

 “With the support of locals, a corrupt person like Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar can be defeated by Gaude in Priol,” said AAP leader Valmiki Naik, who is contesting from Panaji. 
 
 “We will support honest politics and Gaude is a sure shot candidate to take on the might of Dhavalikar,” added Oscar Rebello, another AAP leader. He also condemned the delay in declaring candidates by other political parties.
 
 “There are barely 15-20 days left for elections and the opposing parties still don’t have their candidates ready. Their business dealings and negotiations with each other are still going on. The BJP is doing import-export deals with erstwhile Congress candidates, who they themselves had declared as corrupt.”
