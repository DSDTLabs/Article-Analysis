AHMEDABAD: Income-Tax (I-T) department on Tuesday conducted searches at 50-odd premises of jewellers, bullion traders, moneylenders and their middlemen based in Ahmedabad, Mehsana and Visnagar. They had allegedly deposited huge cash amounts in their bank accounts after November 8, 2016, the day when demonetization was announced.

 “We have conducted search and survey operations at 50-odd premises of two well-known bullion traders, seven jewellers, two moneylenders and around seven middlemen. Searches were made at their residential and commercial establishments in these three cities,” sources in I-T said on Tuesday.
 
 According to sources, these traders and jewellers came on their radar after large cash deposits were found in their bank accounts after the Centre announced scrapping of high-value currency notes in November last year.
 
 “We have found that these traders and jewellers had deposited huge amounts of cash in their bank accounts after November’s note ban. The search operation is still going on and it may continue till Wednesday,” said sources in the I-T.
 
 Sources said that these bullion traders included city-based Parker Bullions, Jinjuvadia Jewellers,  , Sanjay Manubhai Jewellers,  . In Visnagar, the search were conducted at premises of Shreeji jewellers. Sources said I-T officials are acting on the presumption that the jewellers had sold gold at premium rates post-demonetization to help launder black money and also made back-dated bills.
