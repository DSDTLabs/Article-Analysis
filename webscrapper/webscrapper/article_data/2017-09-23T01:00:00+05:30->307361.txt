Although tight-lipped about the plot, the 32-year-old from Shahabad Marakanda, a town in Haryana's Kurukshetra district, who also holds a DSP rank in Haryana Police, says he is confident the makers will do justice to his story.

  Diljit will soon undergo rigorous training in hockey for the role and Sandeep is keen to teach Diljit himself. "I want to teach him myself so that he knows not just the techniques but my style too. I want to be involved in whatever way I can and this is my strength," says Sandeep. The hockey player has already had some experience teaching actors hockey skills, having worked as a consultant with Punjabi film Khido Kundi. "I trained actor Ranjit Bawa in that film as he played a hockey player, so I know a little bit about how to train actors in hockey. With Diljit, however, I want to give him my style, mannerisms as well. So that he looks convincing as Sandeep," the former Indian captain says.
