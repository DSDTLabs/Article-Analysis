BEGUSARAI: Chief minister   has said the Centre should urgently initiate corrective measures to ensure the Ganga’s unhindered flow if it seriously wishes to restore the pristine purity of the holy river.

 “Dams and other projects have come up in the upper basin over the years, which have reduced the flow of the river in the lower plains, causing heavy deposition of silt. Bihar as a result has become prone to frequent floods,” he said. 
 
 The CM was addressing a function after unveiling the statue of Dr P Gupta at   in Godargama village in Begusarai district. Gupta was a leading physician, who is remembered for yeoman service to the poor. He is also revered for his contributions to the society as an archaeologist, cultural activist and litterateur.
 
 Godargama is situated close to the Ganga. “I raised the issue of siltation even at the   meeting in New Delhi. In response, the PM directed a committee of experts to study the problem. However, the committee members did not visit the spot and submitted a report without studying the ground reality,” the CM said and added the situation demanded an integrated silt management policy.
 
 Terming the current political discourse in the country as “vague” and “without direction”, Nitish said it was because of this that he chose to connect the political discourse with social issues like prohibition, drug de-addiction, dowry and child marriage. 
 
 Education and women empowerment are the other areas which his government has been working on. “We had started with a budgetary allocation of Rs 4,200 crore for education in 2005-06. It has been raised to Rs 25,000 crore in 2017-18. The current enrolment rate in higher education in the state is only 13.9%, much below the national average, which the state government intends to up to 30%, he said.
 
 Dr Gupta’s son  , who is an eminent economist and member-secretary of Patna-based Asian  , also spoke on the occasion.
