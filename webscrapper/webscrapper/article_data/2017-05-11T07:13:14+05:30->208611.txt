AMRITSAR: Miffed over appointing Sangrur   as the Punjab unit president of AAP, party’s last   candidate from Amritsar   has decided to end his   and start   at his own level.

 A former SAD leader, Sandhu made this announcement after AAP sacked him on Wednesday for his alleged anti-party activities. Talking to TOI , Sandhu said, “Ask anyone having even little political acumen whether Bhagwant Mann is the right choice to be party president. I dared to express people’s, especially volunteers, sentiments openly and as a result I have been fired.”
 
 On his Facebook page, Sandhu had opined that AAP should be named as ‘PPP (Peg Payala Party)’, which earned the ire of AAP’s senior leadership. Sandhu had resigned from SAD on October 24, 2016, in protest against an incident of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib. He had been chairman of Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA). He had also joined the Congress before switching over to AAP.
 
 Meanwhile, AAP’s newly-appointed state president Bhagwant Mann in a statement issue on Wednesday said the volunteers were the backbone of the party but none of their anti-party activity would be tolerated. 
 
 On the other hand while stating that AAP leadership had offered him the Lok Sabha seat, Sandhu said he didn’t want to pursue an active political life but wanted to serve the people in his individual capacity. He said he didn’t have any position in AAP but was a volunteer.
 
  He said the party had diverted from its ideology and was instead blackmailing gullible people. “Kejriwal should understand, it is not a joke. You can’t play with sentiments of people any more,” he said. Sandhu said he wondered why Kejriwal didn’t want to bring serious volunteers on the forefront of AAP instead of giving plum post to a person who had courted several controversies for his alleged drinking habit.
