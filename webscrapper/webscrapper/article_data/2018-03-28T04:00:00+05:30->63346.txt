Mumbai:  , one of the largest domestic debt syndicators, is entering the equity business by setting up an investment banking unit, which will be spearheaded by JM Financial’s private equity banker  . The new I-banking operation, which is yet to be named, hopes to ride on the soaring private equity deal-making that is driving unprecedented consolidation moves in Asia’s third-largest economy.

 Shah quit   earlier this month after being with the firm for 23 years. He led the private equity deal advisory for the firm in recent years and has advised on transactions worth about $1.5 billion. 
 
 Bajaj Consultants has advised on debt-raising worth about $7 billion, or nearly Rs 40,000 crore, since inception. It has worked mostly with infrastructure companies like  , helping them with financing deals north of Rs 1,000 crore. Bajaj Consultants director Shivam Bajaj said, “After working on debt syndication for long, we recognised that the Indian market is inevitably poised for consolidation in possibly every industry. We wanted to be part of it.”
 
 Bajaj said the I-banking business will be run by a subsidiary company. Shah will be the CEO and will have a profit share in the business. Shah said, “Private equity is going to play a big role in shaping up Indian entrepreneurial enterprises. This, combined with the looming consolidation moves, makes it an attractive practice. We would be looking to advise on deals worth $50 million and upwards.”
 
 Some of the deals Shah advised on in the recent past include KKR’s purchase of 10% in Max Financial, Canadian pension fund CDPQ’s buy into TVS Logistics, GIC of Singapore investment into Bajaj Finance,   investment into   and Blackstone’s initial buyout of Intelenet BPO.
