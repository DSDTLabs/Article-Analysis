Nagpur: Police are set to conduct DNA test in eight-year-old Vansh Pandey murder case to rule out any dilemma over identification of the body.

 On Friday, police presented Vansh’s 17-year-old cousin, rounded up for his alleged involvement in the murder a day ago, before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) which later sent the juvenile to Children’ Observation Home. 
 
 In another development, police also furnished the JJB a request to treat the crime as ‘heinous’ so as to allow the minor cousin of Vansh to be tried as an ‘adult’.
 
 Vansh was strangulated on March 27 by his cousin after a tiff in front of Vrundavan Apartments. The minor had later packed the cousin’s body in a plastic sack before dumping it in Sonegaon Lake. He had taken the body on his scooter. The police theory was rejected by Vansh’s family, including mother Gauri, claiming the body was not of the 8-year-old and the minor was wrongly rounded up.
 
 Senior officer of Rana Pratap Nagar police station Shivaji Gaikwad said we have collected samples for DNA test and would collect the same of his parents to rule out any doubt,” he said.
 
 According to a police source, forensic experts of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) have indicated symptoms of ‘compression of the neck’ as possible cause of death. There is learnt to be no other major injuries which may have added to the cause of death.
