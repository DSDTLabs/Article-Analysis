CHENNAI: Aimed at providing a comprehensive underground   to residents in three divisions, Pallikaranai Sewerage Scheme, after suffering a delay of four years is still stuck in a limbo. 
 
 "It has been over seven years since the project was approved in 2009. The residents in the extended divisions 189, 190 and 191 don't have a proper sewerage connection even as the wastewater generated each day is over 30 MLD," said N Sundaram, a resident of  
 
 The scheme was sanctioned under the   National Urban Renewal Mission in May 2009 at a cost of 58.61 crore. The work began in February 2011 after it was awarded to  . for a contract value of 46.11 crore. The completion was targeted to be completed by February 2013 but a huge amount of work remains pending, say, residents. 
 
 "Only the pumping station rooms have come up and some pipelines have been laid. It is a sheer case of a lack of supervision that has led to such a delay in finishing the project within the stipulated funds," said M Chokalingam, Secretary of the Federation of Residents Welfare Association of Pallikaranai.
 
 In a letter from Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) dated March 2017, the association was told that work would be finished by May and that all homes would be having access to the service in June.
 
 The delay in widening the Velachery - Tambaram Road at Palliakaranai is the main reason for the delay in getting permission to lay pipelines from the state highways. Apart from delay on the side of contractor,   say the lack of permission from state highways has delayed laying pipelines on the main road.
 
 "State highways are planning to widen the road, and are willing to let us lay pipelines only after the road is expanded. Over 90% of the work is done and we expect it to be over by October," said an officer in the zone. A senior Metrowater officer denied major cost escalations despite the delay.
