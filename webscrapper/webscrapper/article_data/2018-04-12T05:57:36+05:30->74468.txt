NEW DELHI: The   on Wednesday refused to entertain BJP’s plea on   panchayat elections, but expressed displeasure over state election commission’s flip-flop, which had extended the date of filing nominations by a day before rescinding its order.

 
 After a bench of Justices R K Agrawal and A M Sapre passed the order allowing the BJP’s West   unit to approach Calcutta HC for their grievance that the Trinamool workers were not allowing its candidates to file nomination papers, senior advocate  , opposing the plea, urged SC to mention in its order that it was not expressing any opinion on the case’s merit as an apex court order carries “weight”.
 
 But the benchsaid, “Our order does not carry weight. If our order carried weight then the state election commission would not have withdrawn its order.” The SC on Monday asked state election commission to address the grievances of political parties.
