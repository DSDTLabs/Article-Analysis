NOIDA: Though the Centre and the UP government have decided to put an end to the use of red and blue beacons on VIP vehicles from May 1, traffic police are yet to receive a written communication from the state government to execute the order.

 According to an order on April 19, the Centre has banned red beacons on all cars, including those ferrying the President, Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India.
 
 While red beacons will be totally banned, when the order is implemented, blue beacons will be visible on roads only atop ambulances, fire service, police and army vehicles, which will be allowed to cut through traffic. 
 
 While cabinet ministers, judges and other officials were earlier exempted from the order, the exemption was by the ministry of road, transport and highways.
 
 Following the announcement, chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath too banned the use of red and blue beacons for cabinet ministers and officers in the state, exempting army vehicles, ambulances, fire brigades and police vehicles, from April 21.
 
 An order to this effect was issued to all cabinet ministers and officers. Despite the order, some vehicles of UP government officials with blue beacons are visible on   roads.
 
 Noida traffic police said they had not received any confirmation in this regard yet. “We are waiting for an official order from the state government. We hope that it comes within a day or two. We will start implementing the order as soon as it is received,” SP (traffic) Prabal Pratap Singh told TOI.
 
 Trafic police officers said the state government has to issue a written order for implementation of any order, including any decision made by the Centre.
 
 The order has to come into implementation across the country from May 1.
