DEHRADUN: With a new government at the helm in  , the teaching fraternity of the hill state is also hoping for a change in its fortune. The government teachers have now pinned their hopes on the new BJP government for enactment of transfer act, their long-pending demand. 

 For long, the teachers have been seeking the law to ensure that there is no scope left for alleged discrepancies in transfers. As per the allegations, there are many in their fraternity who stay in the plains for long, while those who do not have the "right connections" end up posted in the hills and far-flung areas for years.
 
 After getting no relief from the earlier government, in spite of several campaigns and protests, the teachers now hope that their demand will be met "expeditiously" by the new government.
 
 "We welcome the new government and hope that it works for the development of the state and gives due respect to the teaching fraternity. Our demands must be looked into on priority basis. Bringing in a transfer act is one of our prime demands, as it will lead to transparency in the transfer process," said  , president of  , one of the biggest teacher organisations in the state.
 
  It is learnt that former chief minister B C Khanduri had brought in the transfer act to remove the anomalies in the transfer of government employees and shortage of teachers and doctors in hilly and the far-flung areas. But, after him, when the Congress government came to power, the act was annulled and thereafter, many allege that the transfers were at the mercy of amendments in the yearly changing transfer policy, which many say leave scope for discrepancies. 
 
 Subhash Chauhan, president of  , said: "Once the transfer act is introduced, there will be no discrepancy or corruption in teacher transfers."
