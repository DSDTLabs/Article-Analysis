Panaji: Even after three years, the state government has not effected a single land acquisition process under the new land acquisition legislation, the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act that came into force in 2014. While no explanation was offered for this inordinate delay, a official said the rules are now being framed to facilitate land acquisition as per the new legislation. “The process to frame rules has just started and it will take a while before its done,” he said, adding he was unaware why it could not be done earlier. “Probably, they just sat on the file,” he said, adding though in certain cases, initially for farmers whose land was acquired for the Mopa airport and later for land acquisition for the new Zuari bridge, the government assured a good compensation. No new acquisition has been carried out under the 2014 legislation. “Land acquisitions that were started prior to the new Act that came into force and completed thereafter, were under the old notification,” he pointed out. Land acquisition under the new legislation puts the land owner at an advantage. The important feature is that he gets paid as per the market rate for his piece of land. “Gone are the days when the government of the day could purchase any piece of land for a pittance with a prefix of national interest,” the officer said. Speaking to TOI, Jayesh Salgaonkar, minister for rural development agency (RDA), who is also Goa housing board chairman, said the housing board has made few acquisitions during the last few years. And any land acquisition in future would entail paying high compensation, and as envisaged under the new Act.
