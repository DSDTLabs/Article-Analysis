New Delhi:   has floated a   for developing   (RFID) lanes to collect   from 14 entry points in a bid to decongest the capital’s borders. The south civic body, which is the nodal head for toll tax collection, had floated the tender to appoint a consultant in 2015. However, the project has not been implemented till date. 

 Senior SDMC officials said that the project requires advanced technology and it failed to attract any bidder, which resulted in the delay. “A total of 14 entry points will be covered, which will have RFID lanes. Toll points selected for the project include Ghazipur (main and old), Kalindi Kunj, Kapashera, Kundli, Rajokri, Shahdara flyover, Tikri, DND Flyway, Ayanagar and Badarpur border,” said a senior SDMC official.
 
 RFID is a small device with a chip that acts like a bar code. When it passes through a scanner, information about the vehicle can be obtained and toll tax and congestion charge can be debited from its e-purse, an official said.
 
 In October 2015, the Supreme Court had ordered collection of Environment Compensation Cess (ECC) from two multi-axle commercial vehicles to bring down the number of trucks entering the city. The ECC was implemented in November and within two months, the number of trucks entering the capital declined by 20%.
 
 “We had floated the tender earlier but due to technical glitches we couldn’t award the work to any private concessionaire. We have reworked the tender and invited bidders. We are hopeful that the work will be awarded at the earliest,” said a senior official from south corporation.
