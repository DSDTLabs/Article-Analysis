AURANGABAD: The all-out combing operations being carried out by the city police have started showing results as the anti-terrorism cell nabbed a Sudanese national, who was staying in the country for over three years without valid visa. The last time he entered the country was on a tourist visa valid for three months. 

 The incident has left serious questions over the functioning of city police's Special Branch, which is supposed to keep a track of foreigners visiting the city. The accused - identified as   Ahmed Mohammed Al-Hasan (35) - was currently residing in   area of the old city.
 
 During the primary probe it has come to fore that the accused has been residing in India for the past eight years. Initially, he had come to India on the pretext of education and left the country in 2013. The following year, he entered India by bagging a tourist visa with a validity of three months, during which he fell in love with a woman hailing from   tehsil and eventually married her.
 
  commissioner of police   said, "It's serious that foreign nationals residing in the country even after expiry of their valid visas. It is more serious when such cases remain undetected for years." He added that the police are cross checking all details extracted from the accused and the decision to deport him would be taken after consulting authorities concerned.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (headquarter)   said, "The accused was nabbed from Buddhi Lane area, when   sleuths found him trying to avoid the patrolling team. After being intercepted, the accused was asked for his documents, as he failed to produce them the sleuths detained him. The suspect has been handed over to the City Chowk police station for further questioning."
