Dharamshala: Cricket fans and local entrepreneurs of the tourism and hospitality industry here have been left disappointed for the fifth consecutive year with the Indian Premier League (IPL) giving Dharamshala cricket stadium a miss yet again.

 Many people had pinned high hopes on return of the sports event under the BJP rule in state since the International Cricket Stadium of Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA) is headed by BJP MP Anurag Thakur. It was Anurag who had played a vital role in Dharamshala hosting these matches from 2010 onwards. The last IPL match was held here in 2013.
 
 Earlier, the HPCA had blamed the Congress government in the state for levying security fee and entertainment tax on Kings XI Punjab, which resulted in shifting of the home ground of this team out of Himachal Pradesh.
 
 However, the IPL matches have failed to return to the hill state this year too and no match has been allotted to this scenic stadium.
 
 When contacted, Anurag said the state had suffered due to the impact of the policies adopted by the previous Congress government and that was the main reason for loosing these sports events.
 
 “The policies adopted by the Congress government were discouraging for the IPL organizers. Now that the BJP government is in power, it is hoped that cricket events will soon return to state,” he said.
 
 Sanjay Sharma, spokesperson of the cricket association, said, “The schedule of the matches has been finalized but Dharamshala has not been selected as the venue. Earlier, this stadium was the home ground of the Kings XI Punjab but since they have opted for Indore, no match was allotted for this place.”
 
 Meanwhile, Ashwani Bamba, president of the hoteliers association said it was a big loss to the tourism industry of this area. “Not only hotels, cricket matches here support additional revenue generation for small shopkeepers, cab owners and street vendors too,” he said.
