AMRITSAR: Pakistan repatriated a runaway 21-year-old Indian youth   with thalassemia via Attari border on Thursday. 

 Jitender, a resident of Seoni village in Madhya Pradesh, had run away from his house following an altercation with his family and inadvertently crossed over to Pakistan in August 12, 2010. He was arrested and sentenced for almost a year in 2014. Intelligence sources here said that   was lodged in Hyderabad and Karachi jails. There were reports in Pak media that Jitender was a thalassemia patient and used to undergo regular blood transfusion in Pakistan .
 
 Immediately after receiving Jitender from Pak Ranges, he was taken to civil hospital for medical check up.
 
 Civil surgeon H S Ghai said medical investigations revealed that Jitender was anaemic with haemoglobin count of 6gm. He said no specific medical test for thalassemia was conducted and Jitender could be anaemic due to poor hygiene and food in jail.
 
 Senior medical officer Dr Charanjit Singh who attended Jitender said he talked like a normal person of his age and didnâ€™t mention that he underwent regular blood transfusions in Pakistan.
 
 Around 8.15pm, Jitender was taken to airpot in an ambulance to fly him to Delhi.
