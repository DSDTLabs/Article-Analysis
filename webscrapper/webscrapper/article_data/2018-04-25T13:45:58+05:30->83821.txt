KERI: Public works department, Valpoi, has commenced work on constructing a road from Pali in Valpoi to Jambhul junction in   Ghat on the Sakhali-Belagavi highway. However, principal chief conservator of forests   said his department will not allow the construction of the road within the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary without “lawful permission”.

 “We have given priority to the protection and conservation of the sanctuary as it has proved to be the natural habitat for the tiger,” Saxena said, even as environmentalists alleged that PWD had not obtained necessary environmental clearances from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change. 
 
 Assistant engineer PWD   told TOI, the department is in the process of obtaining necessary clearances. “We are meeting forest officials on April 25 to discuss the approval for the work,” he said.
 
 Work on the road was recently inaugurated by former chief minister and Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane. 
 
 Sarpanch, Dongurle-Thane village panchayat, Sarita Gaonkar told reporters, “Our panchayat wants the Pali-Jambhul junction road to be completed at the earliest as it will open new opportunities of development for the people of the area.” 
 
 Range forest officer, Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, Prakash Salelkar has submitted a letter to PWD assistant engineer stating that a part of the road lies within the limits of the sanctuary. “Any physical changes within the jurisdiction, requires the permission of the chief wildlife warden, otherwise it amounts to violation of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and is in contempt of the   judgment 202 of 1995,” the letter stated.
