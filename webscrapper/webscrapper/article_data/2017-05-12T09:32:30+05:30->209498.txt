HYDERABAD: Many of the trees left uprooted in the   were   trees, said   on Thursday. While these trees usually do not get  , Tuesday’s speeding winds were too harsh to protect them, they said.

 “In urban areas, these trees are surrounded by concrete, which reduces the strength of their roots. As a result, they get uprooted easily. The trees in open lands are much stronger in comparison,” said  , professor at Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University.
 
 As per records available with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), a high 80% of the trees within its limits are Peltophorum trees (or flowering plan). The remaining 20% comprise Peepal (Ficus Religiosa), Neem (Azadirachta Indica) and Babul ( ) trees.
 
 Meanwhile, with limited demand for wood within the city, GHMC said they were forced to transport them either to garbage transfer stations or to the Jawaharnagar dumpyard. “The number of people using firewood to cook has decreased. Hence we have no choice but to dump them, which, incidentally is costing us a lot of money,” said a GHMC official.
