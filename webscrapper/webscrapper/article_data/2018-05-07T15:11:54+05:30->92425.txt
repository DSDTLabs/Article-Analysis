INDORE: The team of   officials, who had reached Bhopal to investigate the con   case, found out that she had only Rs 10,000 in her bank account.

 Soniya Sharma, a 26-year-old woman, was arrested last week for posing as   Ajay Sharma’s sister and availing special treatment at the officer’s mess. She was sent to district jail on Saturday. Police also learnt that she had undergone a sex-change operation three years ago. 
 
 The accused spent the night in the Mahila ward of the district jail on Saturday night and also took food, which was offered to her, said the jail authorities. 
 
 “She was enquiring about the procedure to meet the family members when I met her in the morning on Sunday. Apart from that she has not spoken about any discomfort or any problem. She has not created any tantrums and did not make any demand,” district jail superintendent Aditi Chaturvedi told TOI. 
 
 The superintendent added that they also conducted medical examination of the accused but did not find any problems in relation to her health. “She is healthy,” Chaturvedi added. 
 
 The entire matter had come to fore after   was told by his stenographer that he had come to know from Palasia police station in charge that his sister had been staying at the mess. When it was investigated, the woman turned out to be an imposter. 
 
 It was learnt that the woman had also conned people in Ujjain by allegedly posing to be an incarnation of Goddess Durga. 
 
 Police officials investigating the case said that they are now looking into how she acquired the vehicle and a constable. “We are looking into the matter,” said ASP Rupesh Dwivedi.
