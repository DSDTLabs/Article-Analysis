NEW DELHI:   president   came out strongly in defence of   rights and questioned   over persistent "neglect"of Bhimrao Ambedkar.

 "Congress, which is mocking the DNA of PM Modi, is the same party which defeated Ambedkar not once but twice. Made flimsy excuses to ensure his portrait was not placed in Central Hall. Denied him a Bharat Ratna. India has seen through their negative politics," Shah said.
 
 He said the government's commitment to fulfilling Ambedkar's vision was unwavering. "All efforts of the government are aimed at transforming the lives of Dalits. We will continue our efforts to make our Dalit sisters and brothers the makers of New India. We will fulfil their aspirations and dreams. Jai Bhim. Jai Hind," Shah said.
 
 He lashed out at Congress and other opposition parties over their allegations of weakening the SC/ST Act.
 
 "Right from the day the apex court gave a judgment on SC/ST Act, the central government acted in an immediate and informed manner," Shah said.
 
 "Due to the politically driven manifestations of a microscopic minority of dejected and rejected political parties, crores of innocent people suffered. These parties owe our Dalit sisters and brothers an apology for their misdeeds," he added.
 
 Shah said contrary to opposition allegations, the government had strengthened the Act through an amendment in 2016. "This was done in line with our commitment to the welfare of SC and ST communities," he said. He also accused opposition parties and vested interest groups of spreading panic about reservations among the Dalit community before every election.
