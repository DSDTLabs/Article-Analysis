NOIDA: A section of buyers waiting for delivery flats in Noida and Greater Noida wrote to finance minister Arun   on Monday, requesting that they be spared from paying installments to banks until their houses are handed over. 

 The buyers, under the banner of the Noida Extension Flat Owners’ Welfare Association (Nefowa), said they were facing the double burden of having to pay   as well as rent for the accommodation in which they are currently staying at the same time. There are around 2 lakh apartments overdue in   or Noida Extension.
 
 “We are already paying rents and each year, the rents are increasing. The builders have taken 95% of the total payment. We have made an appeal that until we get our houses, the banks should be asked not to take EMIs. This will take some financial pressure off the buyers,” said  , the president of Nefowa.
 
 The buyers have also threatened protests to mark their dissatisfaction with the projects that have been stranded for years.
 
 “The state government wants to ensure timely delivery of houses. At present, those buildings which are on a smooth track of completion are being handed over, which does not help the cause of buyers like us, who have been waiting for years now,” Kumar added.
 
 “We want the government to sit up and take action, hear us out and enforce the completion of flats. Elections are scheduled next year and the buyers’ voice must be heard. The buyers have been victimised in Noida and the government has to take responsibility to mitigate our situation. We will soon start a series of protests to ensure our voice is heard,” he added.
