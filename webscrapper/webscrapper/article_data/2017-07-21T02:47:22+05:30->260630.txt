NEW DELHI:   have no authority to impose a   on anybody, including MPs, deputy chairman of the Rajya Sabha   has said. “If any MP has committed a crime... the law of the land should take its course.

 Airlines are not given the authority to punish anybody,” said Kurien, after the matter was raised in the RS.
 
 Naresh Agrawal of SP raised the issue of recent flying bans imposed by major domestic airlines, including state-owned  , on MPs. Agrawal wanted to know if airlines could impose such restrictions. He said such an action was a breach of privilege of MPs.
 
 Kurien said the government should take note of it. “MPs are also citizens ... if they commit a crime or mistake, the law of the land should take recourse to it,” he added. He further said, “It is a punishment imposed on an MP for some crime...This cannot be done.”
 
 Congress MP Anand Sharma suggested to the chair that the word “crime” be replaced with “violation”. However, Kurien said if a person beat someone up, it was a crime.
 
 Recently, several airlines had imposed flying ban on TDP MP   after he got into a verbal spat with IndiGo ground staff on being informed that the boarding for his flight had closed. Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad was banned as well after he repeatedly hit an AI officer for not providing him a business class seat on an all-economy flight.
