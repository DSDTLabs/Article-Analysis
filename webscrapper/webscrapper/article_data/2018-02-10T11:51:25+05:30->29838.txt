THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The 1,200 local self-government bodies in the state did not get their due share of taxes for two years as the government delayed in implementing the fifth financial commission’s recommendations.

 
 The government submitted the action taken report on the recommendations on Thursday in the assembly, two years after the commission submitted its report in December 2015. “The government delayed its implementation by two years. As a result, 941 grama panchayats, 152 block panchayats, 14 district panchayats, 87 municipalities and 6 municipal corporations were denied right to receive their due share of state taxes,” said B A  , chairman of the 5th finance commission.
 
 Historically, the rate of implementation of the finance commission’s recommendations has been very poor in the state prompting the commission to raise serious concerns over its subversion. It is also interesting to note that   was in the forefront against the Centre’s move to abolish planning commission and constitute the Niti Aayog.
 
 “It raises serious issues of subverting the recommendations, reversing the   process, centralisation of financial powers of state government and denial of adequate resources to local bodies,” said Prakash.
 
 If the state is known for its promotion of decentralisation, fiscal decentralisation and transfer of more powers and functions to local bodies, the apathy from the government on acting on the commission’s suggestions has put the local bodies in deep trouble by denying adequate resources to them.
 
 The finance commission had recommended that 11% of the net proceeds of the annual state’s own tax revenue ( ) should be provided to local bodies as development fund for the year 2016-17. It further suggested that it should be increased in the subsequent years by 11.5% in 2017-18, 12.5% in 2018-19, 13.5% in 2019-20 and 14.5% in 2020-21.
 
 However, with the delay of two years in implementing the recommendations, the local bodies have lost this share of SOTR amounting to Rs 8,599.48 crore in 2016-17 and Rs 10,105.94 crore in 2017-18.
