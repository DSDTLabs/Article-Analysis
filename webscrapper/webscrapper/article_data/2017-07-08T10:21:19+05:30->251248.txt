 is in a happy space currently. Her search for the perfect recreation pad ended when she stumbled upon a beautiful apartment in  , the legislative capital of Goa. "Now I know where I will spend my vacations," she smiles.

 Ask her how she chanced upon her latest acquisition and the actress informs that a friend demolished his bungalow and converted it into a five-storey building. 
 
  
  
 Only friends were invited to buy apartments in the newly- constructed building, which has just five apartments. Since an offer was made to Tabu too, she decided to invest in a second-floor apartment since the complex offers complete privacy.
 
 The residential block is reportedly surrounded by acres of green which offers owners the lure of outdoor activities, including cycling and taking long walks. The building also has its own swimming pool and the actress will be able to swim to her heart’s content. "I’m hoping the place will be ready by the end of October," said Tabu.
 
 Once she gets possession of her new holiday digs, she intends to do up the place on her own and is looking forward to flying down her mother, sister  , and nephew for a cosy house-warming party. Besides her apartment in Mumbai, Tabu also has a bungalow in Hyderabad which she has rented out. She has no intentions of sharing the Goa pad with anyone other than family.
