The prosecution opposed the bail plea, stating that Thakkar is the main culprit and the investigation is in progress. The prosecution counsel told the court that more evidence is yet to be collected. In his order, the judge stated that the accused is the main culprit and is alleged to have been running bogus call centres from where American citizens were given threats and money was extorted from them.

 While rejecting the plea, the judge pointed out, “His role is distinguishable from the other accused who were released on bail. Although the offence is not punishable with death or life imprisonment, the accused is main culprit and there is scope for further probe and hence rejected the bail.” 
 
 Investigations revealed that the call centres used a prepared script to speak to their victims. The accused were skilled at speaking and some of their calls would last more than 30 minutes.
