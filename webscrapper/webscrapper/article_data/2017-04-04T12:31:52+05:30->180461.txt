MADURAI: Fifteen fishermen hailing from Kanyakumari,   districts in Tamil Nadu have been released from the custody of   where they were held for alleged poaching in territorial waters. On Monday, they reached Bahrain from where they had sailed on a fishing expedition and were apprehended by Iranian authorities. 

 Though an Iranian court had ordered their release on March 14 they were held up for some more days due to national holidays in Iran and subsequent rough weather in Middle East waters. Finally, the Iranian authorities allowed them to set sail on Sunday and the fishermen reached Bahrain on Monday. 
 
 The 15 fishermen, seven each from Kanyakumari and Tirunelveli coastal hamlets and one from Ramanathapuram working for fishing companies in Bahrain, had sailed from the country in three Bahraini fishing boats on October 20 but were arrested by Iranian naval agencies. The   were taken to Ikkish Island where they spent a few days in prison. Later, they were kept in their fishing boats under custody. 
 
 Denied livelihood, the fishermen were left to manage with little food and the money they were left with. After the sponsors managed to pay the fine amount imposed by Iran, the court issued release orders allowing them to go if there were no charges against them. International Fishermen Development Trust, an NGO from Kanyakumari, had urged   in Iran to look into their plight. The embassy responded in an email communication that the officials visited them at Ikkish Island on March 22 and had provided the fishermen money to procure food and clothes. 
 
 However, P Justin Antony of International Fishermen Development Trust, said, “Fifteen more fishermen from Ramanathapuram district who sailed from Dubai are still under custody”, he said.
