NEW DELHI: Days after Union sports minister Vijay   felicitated the newly-elected   councillors, there are reports of growing tension between him and Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari. Sources said that  , who has emerged as the new power centre in the state, didn’t know about the event.

 Tiwari plans to meet party chief Amit Shah once he is back in Delhi and discuss the issue with Goel, sources added. “He (Tiwari) was told that it was a central government event,” said a senior BJP functionary. The state chief had asked councillors not to attend the event as it was not organised by the party. “The state unit should be kept in the loop if there is any party-related activity,” said a BJP functionary.
 
 “The party was planning an event to felicitate councillors, but he (Goel) organised one without consulting the party. Such activities should be done by the state unit,” said a BJP member. Goel said he had informed Tiwari about the event. “It was a ministry event. We are trying to engage youths living in slums in sports. We are organising the first slum daud (run) on May 26. I have invited all Delhi MPs,” he added.
 
 The   between Tiwari and Goel started soon after the former’s appointment. The Bhojpuri-actor-turned politician was unhappy as his key aides were not included in the state team announced soon after his appointment.
 
 Meanwhile, names of councillors Santosh Pal, Jai Prakash and Shikha Rai have been doing the rounds for the post of leaders of the House in the corporations. However, BJP has clarified that no letter has been issued by Tiwari so far.
