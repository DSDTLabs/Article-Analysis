NEW DELHI: India’s double Olympic medalist   dispelled doubts about his future by stating that following the end of the upcoming 2018   he intends on participating in the   and the Senior World Champions later this year.

 
 
 Sushil, who won gold medals in the 66kg events at the 2010 and 2014 editions of the CWG, is hoping for a hat-trick at the upcoming games to be held at Gold Coast City, in the southeast of the Australian state of Queensland from April 4-15. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Sushil’s first CWG medal came in 2010, when the CWG was held in Delhi and he beat Heinrich Barnes 7-0 in the 66kg freestyle category. In Glasgow in 2014, he beat Qamar Abbas in the 74kg final for another gold. 
 
 
 
 Sushil is most well known for being the only Indian athlete to win two individual Olympic medals. At the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing - following a CWG gold and silver at the Asian   Championships a year before - and became the first Indian to win a wrestling medal at the Olympics since 1952. Four years later, in London, Sushil improved the colour of his Olympic medal by claiming silver to become India’s only two-time individual medallist at the Olympics. 
 
 Sushil did not participate in the 2016 Rio Olympics. Once his weight class (66 kg) was moved out of the Olympic category, he trained to fight in the 74kg category. However, with Narsingh Yadav emerging as India’s premier wrestler in the category and subsequently securing the country’s only quota for the Rio Games, the Wrestling Federation of India chose Narsingh as India’s representative over Sushil amid controversy that saw the latter move the courts against the decision, but without success.
