NEW DELHI: Tree lovers and residents of south Delhi’s   are up in arms once again after four more trees were cut on Aurobindo Marg on Saturday night. Residents say they feel cheated by the government after they were assured earlier by environment minister Imran Hussain that no more trees will be felled and a suitable solution will be found to clear the stretch. One of the options discussed was that the trees could be relocated and planted to a different location by uprooting them using a special machine.

 Earlier in July, TOI had reported how residents and tree activists formed human chains around trees on the road after five trees were cut down as part of the plans to decongest four more corridors in the area by widening roads. Residents say four more trees joined the list on Saturday night after they were cut by PWD officials in a few hours, with police protection.
 
 Tree activist Padmavati Dwivedi said, “The forest department was also instructed to not cut any more trees. We have been coming up with ideas and solutions in order to save these trees but such an incident happens all of a sudden. They could have looked at decongesting bottlenecks at Yusuf Sarai market and at Adchini first.” She added that they even possess a recent letter from the forest department where they were requested to join a task force meeting to find an ‘amicable’ solution to carry out decongestion.
 
 A senior forest official, however, said, “They could have caused accidents on that stretch. We gave permission to cut down nine trees several months ago as they were all observed to be in a dangerous position. No fresh permissions have been given and we have received no requests either.”
