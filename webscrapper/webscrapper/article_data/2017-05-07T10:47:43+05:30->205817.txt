CUTTACK:   has been an integral part of the national team which earlier this week broke into the top-100 of   rankings for the first time in 21 years. The prolific striker, however, believes that qualifying for the Asian Cup in 2019 should be the team's top priority.

 "It's good to be among the top 100 teams in the world, but such rankings are insignificant for me. What we need is to qualify for the Asian Cup. That should be the goal for the national team," said Chhetri, who is here to lead  's attack in the Federation Cup.
 
 India, under coach  , have drawn with Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar and Macau in the final qualification round for the 2019   Asian Cup to be held in UAE. They started their Group A campaign well with an away win in Myanmar.
 
 Two teams from the group will qualify for the continent's premier competition. "We have got a good start and we need to keep the momentum going,"   maintained.
