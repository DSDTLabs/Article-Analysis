All the rumours of Sonam Kapoor-
  wedding have come to an end. And that’s because it’s now a reality. The two have officially announced May 8th as their D-day. 

 Although the ‘Neerja’ actor is too occupied with the promotions of her upcoming movie ‘Veere Di Wedding’, if the reports are to be believed, post her wedding, the actor will get busy with her scheduled Red Carpet walk at the   Film Festival. Sonam is reportedly set to attend the grand event on May 14 and 15. 
 
  
  
 
 The ‘Veere Di Wedding’ star will mark her appearance at the French Riviera. Deepika Padukone and   too will be present. And that’s mainly because all three stars are a part of the brand endorsement of the company which happens to be one of the major investors of the fest. 
 
 However, as per recent reports, Sonam’s ‘Raanjhanaa’ co-star Dhanush will also be going to Cannes this year. The actor is likely to launch the poster of his next titled ‘The Extraordinary Journey Of The Fakir’. The film also features an Argentine French actor, Bérénice Bejo. 
 
 Dhanush’s movie is slated to release on May 30th in France. But apparently, the ‘Raanjhanaa’ couple will probably not meet at Cannes considering their schedules do not match.
 
 Moreover, according to a daily, Sonam is likely to get back to the grind in July. She will be shooting for Shelly Chopra Dhar’s directorial debut, ‘Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga’. Post which, she has her commitments for  's ‘The Zoya Factor’, starring   as the male lead.
