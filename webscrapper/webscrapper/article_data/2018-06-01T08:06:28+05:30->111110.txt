AHMEDABAD: Probing phase II of the Bitcoin case, with the value of money extorted believed to be Rs 155 crore in the Bitconnect case, the state CID (crime) on Thursday made three more arrests. One of the accused persons was found in possession of 9kg of gold, worth Rs 2.5 crore.

 Investigators said Jignesh  , owner of a farmhouse near Surat, surrendered to CID (crime) along with three others on Tuesday. Two officials of Bitconnect, an international cryptocurrency exchange, were illegally confined at this farmhouse and 2,239 Bitcoins were exto-rted from them by accused and Surat-based builder   and others. However, CID bought time to gather evidence and valuables in the case.
 
 P G Narwade, inspector of CID (crime)â€™s office in Surat, confirmed the arrests of Moradiya, Umesh Goswami and Manoj Kyada. He said further investigation, including identifying property and valuables, is on. He, however, refused to comment on the gold seized in the case. Sources said Moradiya was given 500 Bitcoins, worth Rs 25 crore, which he allegedly invested in his moneylending business and converted into assets. Bhatt and eight others are accused of abducting   and  , employees of Bitconnect, and extorting 2,239 Bitcoins from them, after the firm was reportedly unable to deliver the returns it had promised. From this haul, a team of Amreli police in turn allegedly extorted 176 Bitcoins from Bhatt, for which Bhatt approached CID (crime).
