NEW DELHI: Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu today said that a meeting between the Canada's Prime Minister  , who is currently on a visit to India, and chief minister   has the potential to transform the entire state.

 
 "The 20-minute meeting between   Captain Amarinder Singh and   Justin Trudeau can take Punjab 20 years ahead. This visit will strengthen India and Canada relations, it is a mutual symbiosis which can transform both the countries," Sidhu said.
 
  
  
 On Monday, CM Singh had confirmed that he will meet the Canadian PM today, when the latter visits Amritsar and expressed the hope that the meeting would strengthen the "close Indo-Canadian business ties as well as the deep-rooted people-to-people relations."
 
  
  
 Trudeau's visit to India has been riddled with controversies, mainly because of his government's support to pro-Khalistan groups.
 
 Earlier this month, the CM had said that while he had no problem meeting Trudeau, however, there were some ministers in his cabinet he would not meet because they "have negative views regarding Punjab".
 
 A few days ago, the CM welcomed the Canadian PM and said that he would be "happy" to welcome Trudeau and hold "meaningful talks" with him.
 
 The chief minister had changed his stand after it was reported that two Sikh ministers in the Canadian PM's cabinet had dissociated themselves from Khalistani separatists.
 
 Trudeau, who arrived in India on Saturday, is on a week-long state visit to the country. He is scheduled to visit the Golden Temple today.
