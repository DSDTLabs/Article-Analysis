CHANDIGARH: Police nakas to check the movement of what police describe as "anti-social elements" have, of late, been causing traffic jams across Chandigarh. 

 With the police laying nakas on busy rounds around rush hour, when people are headed back home after work, commuters travelling towards Panchkula (on Madhya Marg), Mohali (  and  ), and Zirakpur ( ) get caught in traffic jams.
 
 At times, such is the chaos caused by the nakas that traffic jams even affect movement of vehicles on roundabouts. Last week, in Phase 1 of Industrial Area, a police check caused traffic jam near the Sector 29-31-32-30 roundabout.
 
 A resident of   who commutes to Chandigarh every day, Gurmeet Singh, said police should at least be aware that criminal would realise there is a police check by looking at the traffic jam. "It is not that tough to realise when a police naka results in a traffic jam. They should find a better way to catch criminals, instead of just hassling everybody on the road," he said. A regular police check on Madhya Marg, near Sector 8C, also chokes up traffic on Madhya Marg. At times, it takes an hour to pass through the traffic. In fact, the heavy traffic results in people with SUVs driving over dividers and, in the process, breaking the law.
 
 SP (traffic)   said they could not guarantee that there would be no traffic chaos during police checks. "But we will make sure that timings of police checks are changed. We will try our best to make such checks friendly for residents," he said.
