THANE:   is celebrated around the globe on May 23, in a variety of ways, from dressing up as   or wearing green summer dresses, to saving turtles caught on highways, to research activities. On the occasion of World Turtle day, TOI speaks to a few pet owners from the city who decided to bring home the peaceful soul. 

 “I always wanted a pet. But bringing home a cat or dog was not possible as both my parents are working and would not be able to devote much time to the pet. So we got ‘Terti’ as one does not need to be around her all the time and they are a peaceful souls who do not bother the owner,” said Mandira Sawant, resident of Waghbil.
 
 “We adopted a red eared slider turtle. It was with my mother’s friend. They couldn’t keep it as his legs were crooked and they claimed that the reptile used to bite. As I always wanted one, we brought it home and since then Monty is with us. He has never bitten anyone yet. He roams in the house the whole day and in the morning we keep him in the balcony for basking,” said   (13), resident of Upvan.
 
 “Most of the owners are not even aware of how a turtle should be kept; the water in which they are kept is also not clean nor at a proper temperature due to which they suffer from skin infections. Also, they are not fed properly due to which they have calcium and vitamin deficiencies. Some even die of pneumonia. It is seen that the reptile is always kept in water which should not be done and they need to have an area in a tank where they can come and sit out of water. A turtle can die due to constant swimming, they need rest, ” said Dr  , veterinarian.
