NEW DELHI: Amid uncertainty of the status of DUSU’s newly elected president,  , following a high   notice on Wednesday, National Students’ Union of India ( ) issued its year-long plan for the students’ body on Thursday.

 Even as Tuseed and other NSUI activists stayed in the DU proctor’s office till late evening to get entry into the office of Delhi University Students’ Union (DUSU), NSUI called the universities “public goods” and said it was opposed to privatisation of Delhi University (DU) under the guise of self-financing and autonomy.
 
 The NSUI-led DUSU will hold bi-weekly ‘Democracy Dialogue’ at different colleges and start ‘Meri Marzi’ — a campaign across DU to promote students’ right to personal freedoms, especially safety of women students without subjecting them to moral policing. “We firmly believe that universities are a place to promote critical thinking and that debate, dissent and dialogue are non-negotiable aspects of all universities,” said the Congress’ student wing in a statement. 
 
 They will also campaign to reopen the 24x7 DU library, which was demolished in 2010, study the high variance of fees across colleges, and set up a committee to draft a charter on students’ rights after consulting students in all colleges.
 
 NSUI also said a committee would be formed to provide a platform to resolve students’ grievances vis-a-vis the administration, enable structured student participation in academic and executive decision-making of the university, and support and facilitate those who need additional help to assimilate and get the best out of their university experience.
