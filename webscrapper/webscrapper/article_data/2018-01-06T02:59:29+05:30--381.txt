MUMBAI: Residents of Zia Apartments say Friday’s fire could have been avoided if   had taken action on their complaints against illegal godowns in the basement of their building five years ago. They pointed out that the fire brigade had also, in 2013, objected to the presence of the godowns. 

 The Development Control Regulations say basement cannot be used for storing hazardous goods, but the godown where the fire erupted had inflammable materials like mobile phone batteries. 
 
 According to the fire brigade’s report of March 2013, they inspected the premises and found trade activity being carried out in the basement as highly objectionable from the fire risk and life safety point of view. The assistant engineer, senior inspector and licence department of E ward were requested to visit the premises and take stern action. 
 
 Sayyad Ahmed Hussain, chairman of the building, said, “From 2013, we complained to every authority possible, from police to BMC, yet no action was taken. Our major fear was what would happen in case of a fire.” 
 
 He also added that they had sought an indemnity bond from the godown fearing such an incident. The local corporator, Rais Shaikh, alleged that the godown was illegal. “Despite there being a report, the authorities chose to look the other way. They should have sealed the premises,” said Shaikh. “The BMC officials should be booked for criminal act. 
 
 Four license inspectors knew about this irregularity but did not act. Moreover, the society file has gone missing after the fire,” he told TOI on Friday evening. he said four officers sat on the building’s file and one of them is now under suspension. “Suspension is not enough. They should be punished severely,” said Shaikh. Sahebrao Gaekwad, Assistant Municipal Commissioner, E ward said they are yet to check the plans of the building as it was an old one to determine if there was permission issued or not.
