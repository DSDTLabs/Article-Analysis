PATIALA: The   (PSEB) Engineers’   will hold state-wide protest meetings on Monday against non-payment of salaries for the month of January. 

 Association general secretary Devinder   said, “The   ( ) management has failed to take proactive measures on the financial front, like getting the subsidy amount released from the state government as per the tariff order. This has led to non-disbursal of the monthly salaries.”
 
 Costly power purchase from private thermal plants and releasing payments on priority to them were worsening financial position of the state-run power companies, he added.
 
 Goyal said the   government was required to pay Rs 950 crore per month in advance, but it had paid only Rs 2,500 crore during the first 10 months of Rs 10,600 crore due up to January in 2017-18 financial year.
 
 “Besides, due to lopsided power purchase agreements signed with private thermal plants, PSPCL is to pay Rs 8,000 crore to them during 2017-18 out of total power purchase of Rs 1,7000 crore. The poor financial health of PSPCL was also affecting consumer services badly. Due to paucity of funds, improvement works are the last priority. Also, the interest paid on loans to bridge the subsidy gap is borne by consumers by paying higher tariff every year,” he alleged.
