 Many students struggled to finish the paper in time. One of them was   of a government model senior secondary school. She said: “The paper was lengthy but easy. Except two questions, the rest were from the NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) book. The 4-mark questions, which required a grip on concepts, were hard to attempt for an average student.”   of the same school said: “The paper was not so easy for me and I hope to just scrape through with passing marks. I missed a compulsory question worth 15 marks, as the time got over. The short answers were all I could revise.”
 
 Candidate   said the paper was easy for the students who had prepared well in pre-boards. “The map problem was the easiest. I managed to complete the paper a good 10 minutes before the allotted time. This paper sure was lengthy but it was scoring, too. The long answers tested your time-management skill a bit; otherwise the paper was no challenge even for an average student.”
 
 Amandeep of DAV Model Senior Secondary School was confident of getting more than 65 marks out of 80.
 
 “The new pattern of the test created a bit of problem but last-minute revision helped,” the candidate said.
