AMRITSAR: Sangat Langah Kartarpur, an NGO, has expressed fears that the heritage building of Gurdwara Sri Darbar Sahib at   in Gurdaspur district could be demolished. The NGO said this following the handing over of karsewa (volunteer work) to a religious outfit. Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) has, however, denied the reports.

 For 18 years now, the NGO has been leading a movement for the construction of a corridor between Dera Baba Nanak and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Narowal district of Pakistan, which is about 4km from the international border.
 
 Sangat Langah Kartarpur founder B S Goraya told TOI on Friday, “We have reports that SGPC has given ‘karsewa’ of Gurdwara Sri Darbar Sahib to a Sikh preacher due to which there is much resentment among people of Dera Baba Nanak.”
 
 Quoting sources privy to the blueprint of the new design of the yet to be constructed gurdwara, Goraya said, “The proposal is to altogether shift the front face of gurdwara to another direction which can’t be tolerated since this is a heritage building.”
 
 He said that the building of gurdwara was built in 1744 and later Maharaja Ranjit Singh offered a copper-gilded palanquin to the worship place.
 
 Goraya said that he was told that there was need of construction of a new gurdwara building as water seepage at various places in the heritage building had damaged the structure.
 
 When contacted, SGPC chief secretary Roop Singh said, “For now there are no plans to construct new Gurdwara building and whenever SGPC deems it fit to erect new building it would be done with full planning.” He, however, added that an SGPC team had visited the gurdwara for clicking photographs which were required for printing in the calendar.
