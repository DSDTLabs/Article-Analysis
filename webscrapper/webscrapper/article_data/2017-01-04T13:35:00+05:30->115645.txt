SURAT:   (SMC) has decided to include a floral garden, a view tower, a war memorial and a times museum, which are proposed to be built in the city, also in its list of iconic projects for which   (EOI) would be called soon. 

 At present, expansion work of indoor stadium, construction of outdoor stadium, Sardar Smruti Mandir, SMC headquarters building, another weir on Tapi river, riverfront development, second phase of Gopi Talav and eco park at Dumas have been classified as iconic projects. 
 
 However, work on none of these inconic projects has so far started though a few were conceptualized eight years ago.
 
 The view tower has been envisioned with a multi-cuisine restaurant like the one that exists in London. It will be a 40-metre high tower having a diameter of at least 35 meter. 
 
 “The view tower will also spur development of a city square. This can be another identity for the city. We are checking viability of the structures before calling for expression of interest (EOI) from parties,” municipal commissioner M Thennnarasan said.
 
 The floral garden would be like the   in New Delhi while war museum and times museum will depict country and Surat’s glorious maritime past. 
 
 “The projects won’t be allowed to linger on for years together. We will make provisions for the projects in this year’s budget,” Thennnarasan added.
