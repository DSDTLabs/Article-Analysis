PATNA: Kids armed with water guns, youngsters moving around in old clothes, singing   songs and glasses of ‘thandai’ being served to everyone — The mood is set for Holi, the festival of colours. 
 
 Holi plans, not files and deadlines, were being discussed at government and corporate offices on Wednesday. As most offices will remain closed on Thursday and Friday along with the weekend, Patnaites were not in a mood to work. 
  
 City residents thronged the markets for last minute shopping and youngsters visited boutiques to get special dresses stitched for Holi. Wasim, the owner of a Boring Road-based boutique said white-coloured cotton kurtas were in demand. “Women prefer colourful dupattas or bundis with white kurtas. Pink and orange-coloured dresses are also popular,” he told this newspaper. 
  
 ‘Bhang’, often considered as the main ‘prasad’ of Lord Shiva, was also being sold at ‘paan’ shops in the state capital. Santosh Kumar, a ‘thandai’ seller in Maurya Lok, said people had been visiting his shop for the last ten days. According to him, “The rush has increased after the prohibition of liquor in the state. People are also buying ‘thandai’ and ‘paans’ for Holi Milans and office parties.” 
  
 Another ’thandai’ at Khajpura has been witnessing huge rush of customers. “The ‘bhang-thandai’ is available for Rs 60 while the plain ‘thandai’ is available for Rs 40,” said shopowner Subodh Kumar. 
  
 Meanwhile, food safety wing officials of the state health department have asked revellers to buy sweets made of dry fruits and ‘besan’ and avoid those made of ‘khoya’.
