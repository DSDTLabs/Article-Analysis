GURGOAN: Around   of students of  ,   in   staged a   on Wednesday in Gurgaon to protest alleged arbitrary  . The march witnessed the highest number of participation in protests of its kind in Gurgaon so far. 

 The school had announced a sudden closure last week, a move that drew criticisim from divisional commissioner D Suresh, who termed it as “unjustified”.
 
 The candle march started from Tau Devi Lal Park in Sector 22 and went up to Sector 22 police station. Parents raised question about the exorbitant fee they had paid last year. “Why did they take so much money in the name of fee last year if they haven’t received the recognition yet?” asked Yashesh Yadav, a parent. 
 
 Parents also said they would lodge an FIR against the school for “duping” them. “So far, we just took the matter up with civil authorities, but we will involve the police now,” Sunil, another parent, said, adding,“we went to police and submitted a memorandum.”
 
 School authorities, however, refuse to budge, saying they were well within their rights to increase the fee. Anshul Pathank, vice chairman DPSG Society told TOI it was incorrect to say school hadn’t ungraded its infrastructure since ownership changed from Chiranjeev Bharti.
 
 “If one were to visit our school, they will realise the changes,” he said. “We will not roll back the hike under any circumstances. We are entitled to generate surplus to invest in the school infrastructure.”
 
 On Tuesday, the school announced summer break for over 3,000 students.
