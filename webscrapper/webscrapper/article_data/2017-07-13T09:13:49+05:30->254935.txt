One police officer of deputy commissioner rank is on night duty every day . Besides, every police station has officers and beat marshals, who work night shifts. In case of any problem, citizens are most welcome to approach the inspector of the local police station, or even the division's assistant police commissioner.
 
 
 
 The wellbeing of senior citizens is one of our key focus areas, and we have rolled out several initiatives for them in the last couple of years. We are already operating a helpline for the elderly , 1090. Besides, we have a dedicated department in the police commissioner's office, which handles only issues concerning senior citizens. The idea of having a BuddyCop-like facility is very good. In fact, we are working on something on those lines for senior citizens. I am sure we will be able to make an announcement about it very soon.
 
 
 We understand this predicament of citizens, especially women. In case of any emergency anywhere, just dial 100, which is a 24x7 facility, or the women's helpline, 1091. Also, the CitySafe app will be rolled out soon, and people using its emergency service will automatically be redirected to the nearest police station.
