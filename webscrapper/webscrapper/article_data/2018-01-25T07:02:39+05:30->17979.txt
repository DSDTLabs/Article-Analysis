AAP’s chief spokesperson for Delhi, Saurabh Bharadwaj, said: “The CM’s invitation was checked by police at the entrance of Raj Niwas, then he was asked to alight from the car and walk.” He claimed that vehicles of other officials were “zooming” inside the venue. He alleged that deputy CM Manish Sisodia and Speaker Ram Niwas Goel were also subjected to “humiliation”.

 As AAP leaders attacked LG over the issue, Bharadwaj tweeted: “The LG is lowering the dignity of his post. Personally, it doesn’t matter that the police checks the invitation of the CM and, then, tells him that the vehicle will not be allowed inside and asks him to walk. But even Pakistan did not treat Narendra Modi the way his (Modi) representatives have treated the CM (sic).”
 
 In response, Delhi Police issued a clarification on Twitter: “During an at-home function at Raj Niwas, no vehicle of any officer of the government of India or Delhi was permitted. There was no delay on part of security in letting in the CM. Any misinformation to this effect is baseless.” tnn
