Tola, also spelt as tolah or tole, is a Hindi term which is used in India and some other Asian countries to measure gold. At present, one tola   is equivalent to 10 grams of gold. 

 Once used by Ancient Indian and South Asian, the weight of one tola today is equal to 180 troy grains (11.6638038 grams) or 3/8 troy ounce. 
 
 During the rule of British India, tola was used as the base unit of mass to weight and measure grains. At that time, one tola was equal to 175.90 troy grains (0.97722222 British tolas, or 11.33980925 grams). 
 
 The root of term tola dates back to the Vedic age when it used to weight seed and other grains. The term Tola is derived from the Sanskrit word 'Tol' meaning weight or weighing. Traditionally, the exact weight of tola used to vary as the weight of tola was determined by the weight of 100 Ratti seeds. 
 
 Several pre-colonial coins, including that of Akbar the Great (1556–1605), weighted one tola. The first rupee, minted by Sher Shah Suri (1540–45), weight 178 troy grains, or about 1 per cent less than the British tola. 
 
 Tola was officially replaced by metric units in 1956, however, it is still in use as the denomination for gold bars in countries like India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Singapore. Among these, ten tola bar is the most commonly traded metal.
