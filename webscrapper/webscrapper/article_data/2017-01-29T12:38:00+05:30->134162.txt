Shimla: On Thursday at midnight, fire broke out at a government high school in Khalini area of Shimla gutting down the upper floor and property worth lakhs of rupees. Around 17 Army men reached the spot along with fire brigade officials to extinguish the fire.

 “At first we had sent a big fire brigade vehicle, but the fire could be extinguished only a little later as the road to the school was too narrow, so we had to send a smaller vehicle to the spot,” said New Shimla SHO Shyam Tomar.
 
 He said they have estimated in the preliminary enquiry that the fire may have broken out due to a short circuit and was aggravated because of the wooden ceiling. He added that they are still investigating the cause of fire and a case has been registered. He said no loss of lives was reported as the school did not have any staff around due to holiday on Republic Day and the following day. 
 
 It took four hours to extinguish the fire from 12am to 3am on Friday. “Getting intimation about the incident, fire brigades from Chhota Shimla, Mall Road and Boileauganj reached the spot and handled the situation from getting worse,” he added.
 
 He said that a hotel’s employee Rohit was walking by and seeing the school on fire, he immediately informed the police.
