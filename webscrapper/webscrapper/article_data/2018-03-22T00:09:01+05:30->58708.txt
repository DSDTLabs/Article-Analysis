Jaipur: As hundreds of protesters from Kho Nagoriyan area poured on to the streets on Wednesday, the state government was forced to assure them of a Rs 68 crore drinking water project for the area, which would be sanctioned in the next 10 days.

 As crowd swelled at the protest site, minister Yunus Khan and senior police officers of the city gathered at the local police station to pacify the protesting group. However, that meeting failed to pacify the protesters. A group of locals then met water resources minister Surendra Goyal at his office who assured them that the drinking water crisis of the area would be resolved at the earliest.
 
 Residents of Ward no. 49 and 50 had been facing water crisis for a long time. Water is supplied to the residents here by tankers. According to official data, there are around 409 water tanks and 150 hand pumps in the area to supply water to 80,000 residents. However, most of them run dry. The water tanker would only refill one of the tanks, which was enough to supply water to 30 families.
 
 “The water supplied is not sufficient and only gives two buckets of drinking water to one family. Hence, there are regular fights over water. The only option we have is to order private tankers which costs us around Rs. 300 and in summers the cost will rise up to Rs. 500” said Reshma bibi, a housewife and resident of Kho Nagoriyan.
 
 There have been complains from the locals that there government water tankers are also sold in black during summers by the employees. But these allegations are denied by the authorities. 
 
 On Wednesday, the residents protested for hours, forcing the government to sprung into action. Residents have threatened to protest again if the government does not fulfil its promise.
