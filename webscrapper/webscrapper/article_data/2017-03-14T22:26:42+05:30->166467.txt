LUCKNOW: UP’s assembly constituency 189, Sadar (Sultanpur) once again turned out to be a `lucky’ seat. Since 1969, the party which wins the seat in Sadar, forms the government in Uttar Pradesh. And 2017 assembly elections were no different when BJP candidate Sitaram in Sadar recorded his win, the BJP finally made a landslide victory in UP with 325 seats, finally ending its 15 year 'vanvaas’.

 From Congress in 1969 to SP in 2012, all parties which eventually formed the government after elections had conquered this seat which was called Jaisinghpur before delimitation in 2009. In 2017, BJP’s Sitaram won by 18,773 votes defeating BSP’s Raj Prasad Upadhyay. SP’s Arun Verma who won in 2012 assembly elections ended third by winning 49,692 votes.
 
 The spell of luck for this seat started in 1969 when Sheo Kumar won from Congress and Congress formed the government. Kumar repeated the feat in 1974 and the Congress retained power.
 
 In 1977, when the Janata wave swept across the country , Jaisinghpur, too, elected a Janata Party candidate-Maqbool Husain Khan. In Lucknow, Congress was deposed.
 
 However, in 1980, the seat again went back to Congress. While its candidate Devendra Pandey snatched it from the Janata Party , Congress came back to power. It was a Congress winner and Congress government in 1985, too. However, Jaisinghpur elected a Janata Dal candidate in 1989 and the party formed the government.
 
 The seat went to BJP for the first time in 1991 and the saffron party formed its maiden government. His government fell after Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 and in the bypolls held the next year, the people Jaisinghpur elected SP candidate A Raish. After the elections, SP formed the government in coalition with BSP . In 1996 assembly elections, BSP candidate Ram Ratan Yadav won the seat and results saw a fractured mandate. However, after six months, BSP and BJP formed their first coalition government. The party retained the seat in 2002 elections and it was a BSP-BJP government again in the state.Continuing with its strange `winning' trend, the constituency elected a BSP candidate in 2007 and SP's Verma in 2012.
 
 A senior BJP leader in Sadar Rishikesh Ojha said, “It is no more a jumla. With each elections, Sadar is turning out to be an auspicious seat.’’
