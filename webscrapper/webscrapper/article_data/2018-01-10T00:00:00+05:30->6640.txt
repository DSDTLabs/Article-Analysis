There is a conflict in the system of the judiciary,   and executive that we are following in the country, which is one of the largest democracies in the world. Why are we taking so many decades to deliver a judgment on a subject that criminalizes one community? This is a constitutional crisis, as there is a law that is directly saying that one section is criminal under it.

 The historical   ruling of 2009 had actually given us a boost and the confidence to speak about what exactly we are standing for. But then, there was a sense of disappointment with the 2013   judgement, which overturned the HC ruling. 
 
 What everyone fails to see is that it is not about same sex. The media has also been constantly highlighting ‘gay sex’, which is not the case. Section 377 definitively talks about human sexuality, but it is also about dignity. The law violates my right to privacy and dignity.
 
 In fact, when MP   introduced the Anti-Discrimination and Equality Bill in 2016 in the  , there was a discussion about homosexuality as well, and the way the members of the house behaved was appalling. Without understanding the legitimacy of the politics of sexuality, they made blind statements that literally undermined one identity, one sexuality and one marginalized community, which is us.
 
 Legislators have power and responsibility and they have to behave in that manner. Section 377 is direct violation against us. The Legislature and Executive have been playing an ‘impotent’ role in this matter, which is why we have knocked on the door of the judiciary. Over the years, there have been steps in the right direction and we are thankful to the court for that. In fact, if you look at the rulings of the present Chief Justice, be it in the case of the right to privacy, Aadhar or triple talaq, among others, they have been progressive, so we are hopeful that at least some bits of the section will be deleted, if not completely repealed.
