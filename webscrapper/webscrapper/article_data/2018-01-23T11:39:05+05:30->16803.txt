SEATTLE: Online giant   opened on Monday a convenience store in Seattle, US, where hungry customers will be able to grab sandwiches and leave, without having to wait in line or use a checkout.

 The American group unveiled the concept for its cashierless, its artificial intelligence-powered ‘Amazon Go’ shop just over a year ago, saying the 1,800-square-foot store would initially offer grocery products to its own employees before being opened to the public.
 
 Early testing however revealed bugs, leading to a delay.
 
 In a message on Sunday on its website, Amazon said it had created “the world’s most advanced shopping technology so you never have to wait in line”. But if the rollout has taken some time, it’s now ready to Go. People armed with the app are able to scan their smartphone with the Amazon Go app at a turnstile, pick up items as they roam the store and place them directly in their bags — without the need for shopping carts or baskets. Instead, items are automatically added onto a customer’s online account when they’re removed from a shelf, or taken off if the item is put back.
 
 By combining computer vision, machine learning algorithms and sensors, the online retail giant can tell what people have purchased, and then charges their Amazon account. If someone puts an item back, they aren’t charged. The store is not without employees — Amazon says there will be people there making food, stocking shelves and helping customers. The store will offer ready-to-eat breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and snacks, as well as some staples like bread, milk, cheese and chocolates. The shop adds to Amazon’s growing physical store presence. Amazon now has more than a dozen Amazon Books stores, which also sell toys, electronics and small gifts. It also has small shops in several malls.
