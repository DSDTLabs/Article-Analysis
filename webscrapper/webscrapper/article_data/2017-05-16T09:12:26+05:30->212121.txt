Surat: A 20-year-old youth was booked at Amroli police station on Monday for allegedly murdering a 45-year-old farmer with a cricket bat after the latter refused to return him a ball that had gone to the deceased’s farm. The farmer died of severe head injuries after he was hit with the cricket bat. 

 Aayush alias Nirav, a resident of Amroli area of the city, had allegedly murdered Chhagan Makwana, who lived in his farm behind Swastik Complex. The police complaint against Aayush was lodged by Vipul Bhil, brother-in-law of the deceased. The accused is yet to be arrested. 
 
 The accused was playing cricket with his friends on a ground near the farm on Sunday night when their ball went into the fields taken on rent by Makwana and Bhil for farming. The deceased and the complainant were sitting in the farm when the accused reached there to collect the ball. Makwana refused to give the ball which led to an argument between them and they began to push each other.
 
 Meanwhile, Bhil went to call his brother and on return he found Makwana lying on ground and Ayush standing there with a cricket bat in his hands. Makwana was shifted to a hospital where he died during treatment. Ayush is unemployed and his father works in a textile weaving unit.
 
 “We will arrest the accused soon. The youth had hit the cricket bat on the head of the victim which led to his death within minutes,” police said.
