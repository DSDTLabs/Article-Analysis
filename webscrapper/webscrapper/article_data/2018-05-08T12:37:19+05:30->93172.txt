JAIPUR: Hundreds of students are protesting against the fee hike in   Pilani since Sunday morning. The protesters are demanding complete roll back of fees hiked by the administration. Students accused the administration of hiking fees at regular intervals since 2009 without any explanation. The fee is Rs 1.59 lakh per semester at present. The issue snowballed after similar protests started at Hyderabad and Goa campuses of BITS. 

 Tension over fee hike triggered after management hiked the fees this year. Deep  , a second year student who was protesting said that from Rs 40,000 in 2010 it has jumped to Rs 1.59, 000 in 2018 per semester. “Institute has to be blamed for the protest as we have taken up the matter with them several times but in vain. Our demand is simple and clear - a roll back of the fee hike to be imposed and no negotiations on the matter,” said Seth. 
 
 The protesters held talks with the management but the meeting went inconclusive. Sources said that it has been the biggest organised protest in the last 62 years in the institute.

 Police went to the campus and asked the protesters not to break any law.
