CHENNAI: A fact-finding report released by People for the   (PETA) has claimed numerous instances of cruelty towards bulls in the form of mental and physical torture during   events held in different parts of Tamil Nadu from January 14 to 28. 

 The report, which was released on Monday, said the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 and the guidelines issued by the   for conducting jallikattu were not adequately followed. 
 
 "Year after year, investigation after investigation reveals that cruelty, injury and deaths are inherent in jallikattu, and no amount of regulation can change that, which is why the   had banned it in the first place," said   CEO Manilal Valliyate. 
 
 “The ban imposed by the SC must be continued in order to prevent bulls from enduring cruelty and dying as well as to protect humans from getting hurt and being killed,” he said.
 
 Jallikattu organiser A Azhagappan said the report released by PETA was aimed at gaining publicity. “The organisation has been doing this for long. It has clear motives behind this drive. We celebrate jallikattu as it’s part of our culture and we will continue to do it,” he said.
 
 Less than two months after the 2018 jallikattu events began, 10 spectators and bull tamers and five bulls died and 757 people were injured, said the 129-page report which included pictures of bulls being tortured during jallikattu.
