CHANDIGARH: Over 3,000 students from Tricity appeared for the online JEE Advanced Exam 2018 at various centres in and around Chandigarh. The exam was conducted by   Kanpur. 

 Students termed Paper l as moderate, while they found Paper 2 to be lengthy.
 
 The candidates had to report at 7:30am for biometric attendance before Paper 1. The entry time for Paper 2 was 12:45pm.
 
 "There were a lot of calculations involved in Paper II. Chemistry section was calculative and tough. Overall, Paper 2 was tough. Physics was comparatively easier as compared to previous years papers," said  , a student who took the test at   centre.
 
 Another student   said, "Paper 1 was easier than Paper II. Mathematics was tough in Paper II. Chemistry was moderate, and Physics was lengthy. I attempted 50 questions collectively from Paper 1 and 2."
 
 The papers comprised objective type (multiple choice and/or numerical answer type) questions designed to test comprehension, reasoning and analytical ability of the candidates.
 
 It was the first time that JEE-Advanced was conducted through online mode and some students were not comfortable with it. The students were handed over an instruction sheet which they could carry with them after the exam. Students could neither get a copy of the question papers nor their responses unlike in the offline exams held till last year.
 
 Because of the new pattern of questions and multiple correct choice questions appearing in both papers, scoring will be lower than 2017, experts said.
 
 While the total number of questions was the same as the previous year, the total marks of Paper 1 and Paper 2 have changed from 183 to 180 this year. Section II had 8 questions where answers up to 2 digits after decimal have to be entered. For the integer-type questions, the range has increased, making it difficult for students to answer such questions.
