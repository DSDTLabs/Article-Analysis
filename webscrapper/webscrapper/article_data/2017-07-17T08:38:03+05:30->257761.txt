TRICHY: The Delhi police arrested 102   from   while they attempted to besiege the Prime Minister's office in New Delhi on Sunday. Alleging that the prime minister had failed to keep his promise made during the first phase of the protest, even after eighty days, the farmers who arrived in Delhi on Sunday morning straight away went there and resorted to stage protest.

 “The prime minister, union minister of state   and Tamil Nadu chief minister Edapadi K Palaniswami had appealed (to withdraw the protest) assuring us that our demands would be met. However, no one kept their word. That’s why we tried to protest here,” said P Ayyakannu, who led the protest in Delhi. 
 
 A total of 102 members from the Desiya Thenninthiya Nathigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam including state president P Ayyakannu were arrested by the Delhi police. Police took them to Parliament Street Police Station at around 9 am. They alleged that they were not provided even a glass of water till evening.
 
 “Police have netted a plot to break our determination by arresting us and making us starve. However, their intention would never succeed,” Ayyakannu said. 
 
 Farmers in the protesting team are mostly septuagenarians. Since most of them were a diabetics, it was difficult to remain with empty stomach for a long time, Ayyakannu alleged, while accusing the inspector of Parliament Street Police station of violating rules. “As per rule, they must provide water and food. He is indirectly abetting us to commit suicide. It is against human rights,” he further stated. 
 
 “After we raised our voices in protest, police arranged for food around 5 in the evening,” said Prakash, a farmer in the protesting team. According to Delhi sources, all the arrested farmers were released from the police custody around 6pm. 
 
 The farmers had left for Delhi to resume their protest at  , which was ‘paused’ after 41 days in the first phase, on July 14. They have decided to continue their stir for 100 days.
