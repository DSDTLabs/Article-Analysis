AHMEDABAD: For  , a city-based businesswoman, the   through the world with the help of someone blind, motivated her to take part in the 21st   in Ahmedabad. The rally is an annual event where blind navigators read instructions printed in braille and pass it on to drivers thereby showing them the way on a 70-km-circuit in and around Ahmedabad.

 She expressed the feeling of all those involved in the car rally organized by Round Table India and the Blind People’s Association (BPA). A record 88 drivers were taking part for the first time. 
 
  Organizers attributed this to the fact that there is more awareness about the cause behind it and the underlying philosophy to take the blind closer to the mainstream by giving participants an idea of how they function.
 
 The rally was flagged off from GMDC ground on Sunday morning by city police commissioner AK Singh, district collector Avantika Singh and chairman of Wagh Bakri Tea Group, Piyush Desai. 
 
  The event saw participation of five teams where both drivers and navigators were women. For Krutika Shah, a physiotherapy student at BPA, it was the fifth year as navigator on one such team. 
 
 “It’s pleasant getting to learn about the driver during the rally. It has led to strong friendships,” she said.
 
 The organizers said that this year they had decided to take the participants to Naaz village where BPA runs a hostel and residential facility for disabled students and individuals. 
 
 “We tried to cover almost all kinds of terrain over the course of 70 km where trusting the navigator’s instructions is more important than what you actually see,” said an official.
 
 The participants included 77-year-old Premshankar Pandya, known for his marathon runs. “For me, it’s just another adventure to push the boundaries,” he said.
