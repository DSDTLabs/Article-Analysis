  The host also confessed that his statements are always misunderstood and his days are not good. Kapil says "Dost naraaz ho kar baithey hain (my friends are upset with me these days)," and we know who the friend (Sunil Grover) in question is here.
  
  
 
  
    said, "No one is upset with you, he is just on a holiday with family."
  
  Sarla walked in and Kapil took a dig at her in front of the guests, but Sarla is also charged to give it back to him. Ayushmann and Parineeti play 'Kaun Bhail Crore Pati' with   and Kapil comes in to do his antics once again. He removes Kiku from the questioner's seat and sits there himself.
