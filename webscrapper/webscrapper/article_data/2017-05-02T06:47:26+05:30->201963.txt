MUMBAI: Is controversial BJP leader  , the  ,  ? Khadse was noncommittal, but did observe that he was tired of dirty politics.

 “I am not scared of the outcome of the ongoing probe against him in the land allotment case. I have done nothing illegal in the row over procurement of land by my family members, but now I am tired of dirty politics,“ Khadse told TOI on Monday .
 
 On Sunday , Khadse addressed a largely-attended meeting of the Leva Patil community in his hometown Jalgaon. “All-out efforts were made to ensure that I do not become CM. I am not afraid of such efforts, but I am certainly unhappy over the dirty politics being played in the entire episode. Members of the Leva community should make all efforts to create a new leadership for the community,“ he said.
 
 Khadse feels the ongoing judicial probe against him for his alleged involvement in the MIDC land scam is being deliberately delayed to ensure he does not return to the state cabinet. After allegation of land-grab were made against him, Khadse had on June 4, 2016 submitted his resignation to the CM. Subsequently , Fadnavis appointed a committee headed by Justice D S Zoting, former judge of the Bombay High Court to probe charges against Khadse. The committee was then asked to submit its report in three months. Whi le it got three extensions, it is yet to submit its report to the CM, and its extended term too ended on March 31, with the CM yet to decide on granting further extension to it.
 
 In the recently-concluded budget session of the state legislature, Khadse had made critical observations against the government over its failure to resolve issues raised by the farmers, particularly the loan waiver. Further, it was a major embarrassment for the CM when Khadse welcomed the Congress-NCP-led Sangharsha Yatra to demand loan waiver at his farmhouse in Jalgaon district.
