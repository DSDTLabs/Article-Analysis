HYDERABAD: In a sensational incident on Saturday morning, an aspiring Telugu actress,  , who has been talking about the existence of casting couch in the film industry, resorted to a 'strip protest' at the office of the 
  Chamber of Commerce at Hyderabad's Filmnagar. 

 
 
 
 Sri Reddy alleged that she was sexually exploited by many producers and directors. She claimed that she was also denied membership of the   (MAA) despite having acted in three films. 
 
  
  
 The actor alleged that several people in the industry demanded obscene pictures from her in exchange for roles in movies.
 
 "They saw the videos and gave no roles. They have even asked for live nude videos from me. That is the extent to which they go to take advantage of women who seek roles," she said. 
 
 
  
  
 
 Sri Reddy said no roles were given to Telugu girls in the film industry. "I have been sexually exploited," she claimed. 
 
 Sri Reddy came to the film chamber in a salwar kameez and started stripping down to her under garments in front of the public. "This is the only way I can think of expressing my grief. Since I got no roles despite exposing myself to several people in the film industry, the only way I can protest is by going nude publicly," she said. 
 
 The actor added that she would escalate the issue if film producers did not encourage local talent. 
 
 "They give roles to actresses imported from Mumbai or others places, whereas we local girls are only sexually exploited on the promise of being given roles," she said.
