Madurai: Seeking to remove cone type loud speakers and alarm bells attached to loud speakers in religious places including churches, temples and jamaths, a public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed before the Madurai bench of the Madras high court.

 On this, the court on Wednesday ordered notice to the Kanyakumari collector. A retired headmaster from Kanyakumari, M George has filed the PIL seeking direction to the collector to remove loud speakers from 35 religious institutions. 
 
 As per the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, sound to an extent of 45 decibel is allowed. But, religious places in Kanyakumari district have loud speakers including cone type speakers which release sound more than the prescribed limit, which is against the Environment (Protection) Act. Besides, due to excess sound, aged people and students are suffering, the petitioner said.
