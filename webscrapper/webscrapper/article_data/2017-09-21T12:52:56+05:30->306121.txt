VADODARA: Hundreds of   were stranded for a long time following a severe traffic jam near   on Wednesday evening. 

 The road around Rhino Circle and the stretch leading to Gorwa was chock-a-block with vehicles as revelers headed in large numbers for   on the Gorwa Road. “We had deployed 15 men on the stretch to smoothen the traffic flow and by 9.30 pm the situation had eased. I was also monitoring the situation outside the garba venue on  ,” said S D Rathod, ACP (traffic). 
 
 The situation worsened as commuters started driving on wrong side as some portions of the Gorwa Road are still closed for traffic. Cyclists were seen carrying their cycles on their shoulders and walking through the traffic jam. 
 
 Absence of traffic brigade that is on strike only added to the woes. Home guards and civil defence volunteers were called in to manage traffic.
