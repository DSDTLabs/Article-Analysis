Shimla: A day after the arrest of father son duo Ramesh and Vinay Dhawan in connection with the murder of Harjinder Pal Singh, a Baddi-based businessman and cousin of former Congress MLA Ram Kumar Chaudhary, the Congress has alleged that Singh was murdered at the behest of “a local RSS leader”.

 On the other hand, the BJP has accused the Congress of playing “dirty” politics in the name of law and order.
 
 Harjinder Pal Singh was killed on Sunday. Former chief minister Virbhadra Singh, in a statement on Monday, had alleged that an RSS leader was said to be behind the killing.
 
 State Congress president Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu had also alleged that an RSS worker had killed Harjinder under the patronage of the state government.
 
 Sukhu alleged that people had no fear of law since the BJP had come to power. He had alleged that Jai Ram Thakur-led state government was being run by the RSS because of which the RSS workers were committing crimes without any fear. “Escaping of the RSS worker after committing the crime indicates that the incident was executed in a planned manner,” he had said on Monday.
 
 Meanwhile, not happy with associating RSS with the incident, BJP chief spokesperson Randhir Sharma on Tuesday said a dispute between the two families was being given a political colour by the Congress which shows that the Congress leaders were maligning the name of state under a well-planned strategy. He said truth was the two families involved in the incident connected with the Congress ideology.
 
 Sharma said Himachal Pradesh had become a crime hub during the Congress regime. He said in 2012, the state had registered 12,000 FIRs that increased to 17,500 by the end of the Congress regime.
