The Thillana Thillana actor plays the role of a biker named Kraig in the movie, which also has   and Prakash Raj. 'Kraig is the villain in the movie. He's a daring biker and also the leader of a gang. It's also an important character in the film in terms of the twist in the tale,' says Krishna. 
To play the part, the actor has been preparing for the past four months. 'I have shed some weight. Kraig also has a rugged look, so I grew out my beard and have also got a new haircut with spikes et al. With the toned looks and urban outfits, I feel like a differnt version of myself too,' he says.
 
 Krishna is also part of an daredevil stunt sequence in the film, he says. 'There's a fight scene between Jayaramettan and me, and Unni Mukundan too joins in halfway. It was fun,' says the actor. 
 
 He says he enjoyed playing the character so much that he is game for more roles with negative shades. 'I am loving the bad boy look. It's refreshing because I was done being typecast as the cute guy because of my looks. I believe an actor should surprise the audience with every role he does. I also want to try varied roles with different getups from now on,' he says, thanking the director   and scriptwriter Sethu for considering him for the role.
