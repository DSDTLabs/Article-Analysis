Newbie  , who was featured in Anirudh’s single  , is on cloud nine. And why wouldn’t she? The Kerala-based actress had got the opportunity to act in the video by chance. 

 “I aspired to get into the field of modelling and acting some day. I have done a couple of photo shoots for a few corporate offices. I have a friend, who works in the film industry, and asked him to let me know if anything interesting comes by. It was he who put me across to the team of Onnume Aagala. When they okayed me for the video, I was in Calicut then. I had to rush immediately to Kochi, where the shoot of the video was taking place. It was a one-day shoot and I was thoroughly comfortable working with the team. Even though I am new to all this, they were very supportive and polite. I am so glad that I got to be featured,” says Sandra. 
 
 And now, Sandra has been getting a lot of offers. “I am getting modelling and acting offers, and auditioning for a few Malayalam films, too. Discussions are going on,” says Sandra.
