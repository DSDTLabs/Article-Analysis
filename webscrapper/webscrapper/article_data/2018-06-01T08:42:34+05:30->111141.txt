ENGALUR
 U: The   ( ), which has been struggling to implement several projects owing to nonavailability of funds, has sent a proposal to the government seeking purchase of 10 new cars,including two luxury vehicles for senior officials.

 
 The authority claimed that its officials will have to visit government departments in   and   several times a month, and that cars in good condition are a necessity. “Several cars used by senior officers are more than 10, and in some cases, 14 years old. We need to get rid of these vehicles for environmental reasons and also because of the fact that their repair and maintenance costs are too high,” Rakesh Singh, commissioner, BDA, said.
 
 Officials said when such cars are out of action, the authority, just like many other government agencies, uses services of travel firms. “These firms cannot be trusted all the time. They are not punctual, which is particularly bad when we have to visit courts or senior government officials with an appointment,” an official said.
 
 Singh, reiterating the cost of maintaining old vehicles is considerably higher than purchasing new ones, said BDA will buy cars in batches.
 
 However, social activists have slammed the move stating there’s no need to splurge money on cars when the civic agency is facing a cash crunch. “The two high-end cars being bought for senior officials alone cost around Rs 50 lakh. Buying so many vehicles will burden the state exchequer. Moreover, this comes at a time when the government will have to buy new ones for ministers in the   government. At least 10 new cars will be needed for JD(S) ministers as they are coming back to power after 10 years. They will insist on new vehicles,” an activist said.
