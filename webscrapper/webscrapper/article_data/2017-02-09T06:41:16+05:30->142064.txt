HYDERABAD: With reports of   flying thick and fast,   working in USA are increasingly opting to work from home, say those in the know of things. Apart from ports of entry , sources say, immigrants are being `checked' outside  ,   and even on the roads.

 “We are getting reports of many techies opting for `work from home'. Many of them, we learn, have not stepped out of their homes for days together. We are asking them to talk to their peers and to reach out to local Indian organisations for assistance,“ said Sundeep Kumar Makthala, founder, Telangana Information Technology Association.
 
 Random checks have been happening in places such as New Jersey , Chicago, Texas and California, where Indians reside in large numbers. “The level of scrutiny at ports of entry has gone up drastically from 1 to 4 on a scale of 5. It has led to anxiety among people. Texas, Arizona and few other Republican states are witnessing more aggressive levels of scrutiny ,“ said Vinoy Mereddy, a software engineer working in California.
 
 Rahul Rao, director of an IT consultancy in Dallas, said: “Although there is no reason to be worried, people are definitely jittery . They are avoiding air travel between cities due to strict immigration checks at airports. Not only that, Indian-origin owners of businesses and IT companies are even mulling selling their businesses and moving out.“ Originally from Hyderabad, Rao said that immigration checks have been extended up to the gates of grocery outlets too.“Their visas are being checked and in case officials have a doubt, the person is being taken in for questioning,“ he added.
 
 Given the current atmosphere, Thatikonda Manoj, a techie from Hyderabad who is scheduled to return to US after a month at home, has been suitably cautioned about the strict checks by his friends in Virginia. “I have been advised to carry all possible documents to avoid any untoward incident,“ he said.
