HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh government on Wednesday urged the   to vacate the stay order on tenders for widening and strengthening of Pedana ­Nuzvid­ Vissannapet road in Krishna district. Ramky Infrastructure Ltd which was originally entrusted with the task of constructing the road was served a termination order on the ground that it failed to execute the work on time.

 The infra firm approached the   and told it that it was unfair to expect it to complete the task without even handing over land to it for the purpose. “On one hand the   has failed to hand over the land to us and on the other state is expecting us to lay the road,“ Ramky counsel said. The court earlier directed the state not to entrust the construction work to any new contractor till further orders. Citing year end problems and certain compulsions to spend this World Bank loan money before the end of the financial year, the state is now urging the court to allow it to entrust the work to a new contractor.
