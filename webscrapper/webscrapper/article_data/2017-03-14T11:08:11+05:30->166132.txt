VISAKHAPATNAM: In a major blow to Visakhapatnam Port Trust, the   (NGT) has directed VPT and the   (PCB) to immediately check air pollution and bring it under control by the end of 2018. 

 The NGT has asked VPT to submit quarterly reports so that they can check if pollution levels are under the permissible parameters. 
 
 The NGT warned the port that if it continued to neglect the pollution control measures, did not reduce dust emission and improve air quality, it would invoke the ‘Polluter Pays’ principle and even restrain the Port Trust from handling coal cargo.
 
 Following a public interest litigation filed by women’s organisation   of port city, the NGT announced its judgement on March 8.
 
 Shireen Rehman, secretary of Chaitanya Sravanthi, said on Monday they filed the PIL in March 2005 and that it was admitted the next month by the NGT. “We got 90% of success in the case as the NGT has ordered the port and PCB to bring pollution under permissible parameters to control fugitive dust emission and make it as clean as possible,” she said.
 
 Shireen Rehman said the port handles almost 30 million tonnes per annum. If the port did not control air pollution, the coal handling would be stopped by the NGT or it would direct the port to shift the coal handling to another place on the lines of a judgement given by a court to Chennai port, she said.
 
 Social activist and former IAS officer EAS Sarma said it was a great success for the women’s organisation. He said the NGT directed the port to scrupulously implement environment management plan with short, medium and long term measures and submit quarterly progress report by filling in the registry with a copy to complainant Chaitanya Sravanthi organisation too. The NGT also ordered the state PCB should also submit the quarterly ambient Air Quality (AAQ) monitoring reports along with inspection reports by filing in the registry, starting quarter ending June 30 this year.
