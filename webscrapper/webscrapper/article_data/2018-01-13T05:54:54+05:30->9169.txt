KOLKATA: After a 45-day hiatus,   resumed operation on Friday. The machine punched through the southern diaphragm wall around 18m below the ground inside the proposed   opposite Writer’s Building.

 Kept on slo-mo (a TBM can’t come to a complete halt to avoid the tedious job of restarting) for one-and-a- half months, the tunnel borer made a successful breakthrough on Friday afternoon.
 
 Prerna was commissioned from Howrah Maidan station on April 2016 and travelled roughly 3km to reach the BBD Bag-Laldighi area on November 27, building 2,100 rings along the way for the 16.3km-line-2 (Howrahbound tunnel) between Howrah Maidan and Salt Lake’s Sector V. The other TBM has built 2,075 rings so far for the Kolkata-bound tunnel.
 
 
  
 Diaphragm is the concrete used to link the tunnels to the six underground stations of the East-West Metro corridor.
 
 A diaphragm has two circular spots, known as the soft eye or the “sweet” spots, where the steel rods are replaced by glass fibre reinforced polymers (GFRP), which the two TBMs must drill through. While Prena punched through on Friday, the other TBM, Rachna, will punch through hers 10 days later.
 
 The diaphragm couldn’t be built because land was not available as BSNL had not shifted the 7,000 landlines from the site next to Telephone Bhawan. On December 3, the telephone company started shifting cables and completed the job on December 21. That’s when   started the diaphragm construction, which ended on Tuesday.
 
 Following this breakthrough, the machine will burrow through the Return Letter Office (RLO) or Dead Letter Office (DLO) building and move on past 21 structures, including seven vulnerable ones on Dalhousie that are being served evacuation notices by implementing agency Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC).
