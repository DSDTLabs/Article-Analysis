BHUBANESWAR: Call it the   that prompted a gang of robbers to plan for a   by stealing bats and jersey from a store, selling sports products near Jayadev Vihar here last month. But their luck ran out as the commissionerate police arrested four of the 15-member gang here on Thursday.

 The special squad and personnel of Saheed Nagar police arrested the   and seized 14 pieces of expensive bats, each worth between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000. Police also seized 14 pairs of white jersey from them. 
 
 Police said Susant Sahoo, 26,  , 29, Harihar Samal, 34, Rama Raman Sethy, 27 robbed the store in Saheed Nagar area here on April 2. Police traced their identities from the store’s CCTV cameras. Police said they are jobless vagabonds and belonged to Jagatsinghpur district. “We were surprised to find that the robbers did not steal any other sports products. They tried to steal shoes from the display board. But they failed as the display board had only one shoe each from the pairs. They could not steal   balls as well,” DCP Satyabrata Bhoi told TOI. “We interrogated the accused and one of them told us that they like cricket. They had planned to organise a cricket tournament in Jagatsinghpur area as most of the gang members belonged to that place,” Bhoi said. 
 
 Police said six other members of the gang were arrested recently and are still in judicial custody. Susant was the key member of the gang, having penchant for cricket. Police said it was his idea to target the sports store to steal bats and jersey. 
 
 While this was the first time Bhubaneswar police arrested those four persons, Bhoi said they were involved in at least 20 cases of robbery, theft and dacoity here and in other districts. Apart from the cricket bats, police recovered 19 expensive mobile phones and 51 grams of gold jewellery from them.
