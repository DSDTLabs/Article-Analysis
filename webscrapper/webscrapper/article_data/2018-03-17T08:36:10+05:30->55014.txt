CHENNAI: A former Anna university professor has approached   against the move to expand   from existing 1,189sqkm to 8,878sqkm, claiming that the   was not equipped and did not possess the requisite manpower to handle such a huge  .

 “When the CMDA was unable to perform its statutory duties and enforce the provisions of Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act for the existing Chennai metropolitan area of 1,189sqkm, it is highly impossible for the authority to perform its duties for the proposed seven-fold expansion,” petitioner K P Subramanian, who was also an urban engineering expert, said.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing on Friday, the government pleader sought time to get instructions from the authorities concerned, prompting the first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice Abdul Quddhose to adjourn the hearing to March 19.
 
 If the area is to 8,878sqkm, it would be very difficult for the CMDA which does not have manpower or infrastructural facilities and institutional network spread over the entire areas, to handle the development. When it is difficult for them to cater even the city of Chennai, they cannot even go to contiguous areas for enforcement, Subramanian added and wanted the court to quash the government order dated January 22 proposing the expansion.
 
 Pointing out that the court is already flooded with several litigations for building violations, and unauthorized constructions, the petitioner said the move would worsen the situation.
 
 This apart, a notification invited objections only from inhabitants of proposed contiguous areas. This is totally against the object of the Act and against the interest of the inhabitants of existing Chennai metropolitan area, he said. “The proposed expansion would greatly affect the quality of life and the standard of living of the inhabitants of the existing metropolitan area, as the CMDA has to expend the time and resources at their disposal to an area seven times larger than the existing one,” he added.
