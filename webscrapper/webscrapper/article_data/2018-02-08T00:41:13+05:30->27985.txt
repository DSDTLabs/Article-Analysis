Tiruvannamalai: As part of the state-wide protest against Tiruvannamalai   K S Kandasamy, around 400 members of the Tamil Nadu Government Employees Association (TNGEA) staged a demonstration in front of the collectorate here on Wednesday.

 The protesters alleged that the collector showed double standards in implementing government welfare schemes, particularly the old age pension scheme, and also that he reprimanded officials in the ranks of tahsildars and block development officers unnecessarily.
 
 He also failed to look into the grievance of the employees, they alleged. The collector’s personal assistant (general) Janaki and personal assistant (panchayat development) Kumari have been behaving disrespectfully towards their subordinates and have also been refusing to give last pay certificate to the officials transferred to other sub-divisions, they claimed, adding that their general provident fund files are being delayed.
 
 Apart from this, they have been organising unnecessary review meetings. “PA [G] Janaki has been refusing to sign files submitted by her subordinates since January 8. We wanted to meet the collector and plead him to redress our grievances. But he did not meet us,” said a member of the association.
 
 To register their protest, they organised a demonstration on Friday last in front of the collectorate. “The collector listened to the speakers at the meeting and said he wanted to address the protesters. But when given the mike, he complained about the noon meal workers and spoke ill about them. This is the attitude of the collector towards us,” Jothi Sankar of the association said.
 
 The employees boycotted the public grievance day meeting to register their protest. Following this, the collector issued show cause notice to 35 officials, including 20 Tahsildars, seeking an explanation for not attending the meeting.
 
 They demanded the government to look into the issue and take appropriate action against the collector.
