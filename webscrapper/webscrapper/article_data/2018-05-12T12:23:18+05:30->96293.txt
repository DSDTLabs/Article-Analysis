PANAJI:   leader and   Lok Sabha MP Narendra Sawaikar on Thursday said that his party accepts the verdict of the municipal elections in Sakhali and Ponda. He said that the BJP would try to analyse the verdict and take corrective measures, but stated that it managed to retain its voteshare. 

 “In both the Sakhali and Ponda municipal council elections, we accept the result handed out to the BJP or BJP-supported panels by the voters,” he said. “At the Ponda council  , as against the last elections, where four of the BJP-supported councillors had been elected, this time around, five have been elected. Our voteshare has remained intact. BJP has good support base in the Ponda municipal council.”
 
 Sawaikar said that the   party was facing a real threat in Ponda. “The Congress party’s voteshare has come down from 4,800 in the last polls to 2,700 now,” Sawaikar said. The South Goa MP said that even in Sakhali, the BJP had retained almost its entire voteshare, falling short by only 189 votes compared to the last poll.
