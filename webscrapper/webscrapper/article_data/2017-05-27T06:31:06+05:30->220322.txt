RAJKOT/AHMEDABAD: A Rajkot-based scribe - Sunil Jadhav - on Friday returned a state government's award as a mark of protest against   violence in   and increasing cases of atrocities on dalits. 

 Jadhav, a columnist since 15 years with various local dailies, was conferred with the 'Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Best Journalist Award' in 2011 by the then state social justice and empowerment minister Fakir Waghela, for his journalistic contribution as a dalit. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was chief minister of the state then.
 
 On Friday, Jadhav returned his award including a citation and prize money of Rs 25,000 to Rajkot collector   at district collector's office. Jadhav was accompanied by fellow scribes and another dalit writer  , who had also returned his state award after Una flogging incident in July last year.
 
 Jadhav had in January decided to return the award but the recent atrocities against dalits in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, made him take the final step. 
 
 Talking to TOI, Jadhav said, "Since Una flogging incident (where four dalit youths were beaten by self-styled gau rakshaks) to recent incidents of brutalities in Saharanpur, dalits have been targeted and the government has remained a silent spectator. The BJP-led governments in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and also at the centre has failed to deal with rising cases of atrocities on dalits. I was painfully witnessing the series of violence which shook me from the core and therefore I was left with the only option to register my protest by returning the state government's award." 
 
 "It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life when I had received the award as appreciation of my work. But atrocities on members of dalit community were so horrific that I cannot just sit and witnessing such brutalities and do nothing," Jadhav added.
