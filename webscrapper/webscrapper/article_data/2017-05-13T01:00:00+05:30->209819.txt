Yesterday at 11 am, when taxi driver Yogesh Kamble was speeding at the Churchgate Station crossroad, a placard that read ‘Let’s take a pledge to drive slow’, caught his attention. When he halted at the signal, students from   approached him and urged him to drive slowly. They even handed over a rose to him, Munna Bhai style!

 Despite their summer vacations, these youngsters took part in this endeavour to spread a message about road safety. In association with   (WIAA), Mumbai Traffic Police, they went rallying around with roses, placards and even pasting stickers on cars. They were joined by the  , Amitesh Kumar.
 
 As a part of the Fourth UN Global Road Safety Week, the event was divided in two phases — a poster campaign and a signature campaign — where these young volunteers urged people to follow traffic rules. Gopi Gupta, a Final Year Science student from KC College, told BT, “As per a survey, even if five percent of the population drives carefully, we can reduce accidents by 30 per cent. As youngsters, we believe it is our duty to not just stop rash driving but also spread the message that it can be fatal.” Deeva Jain, a Third Year Arts student, who was also a part of the activity, said, “These guidelines shouldn’t only be promoted during New Year’s Eve or festivals. We need to follow these rules each day of the year.”
 
 
  
 The aim is to get students across colleges in Mumbai involved in this campaign, said  , Executive chairman of WIAA. “We want to extend this to other institutes in the coming year. Since youngsters are active on social media, it has helped us spread the word quicker,” he said. Various activities like a nukkad natak (street play) with students from   and a drawing competition with kids from BD Somani School, Cuffe Parade, were also conducted as a part of the week-long activity.
