NEW DELHI: Close to 15 AAP   joined BJP on Tuesday. BJP claimed that they decided to join the party as they were upset with the functioning of AAP.

 On Tuesday morning, hundreds of   supporters also gathered at Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari’s residence to join the party. Tiwari said this showed that people had lost faith in the AAP government.
 
 Most of the workers are from Rohini and Sultanpur Majra. Naved Siddiqui, who claims to be the head of AAP’s minority wing in Kirari assembly constituency, said, “AAP is giving tickets to corrupt people. Genuine workers have no say.” 
 
 BJP claimed that AAP’s Rohini district’s president Aman Dabas and vice-president Anju Dabas, Sher Singh (president of Sultanpur Majra assembly constituency), Manisha Singh (chief of the constituency’s women’s wing and vice-president of SC/ST wing) also joined. 
 
 AAP sources said there were a few known faces, including Aman Dabas associated with the youth wing. “About 10 days ago we were told that he and his wife had joined Swaraj India. Now we hear that they have joined BJP,” said a senior member.
 
 “Other people who have left are largely from Sultanpur Majra and seem to be close to the local MLA Sandeep Kumar who was suspended from the party last year. He was not consulted on ticket distribution and that is why some disgruntled people might have left,” he added.
