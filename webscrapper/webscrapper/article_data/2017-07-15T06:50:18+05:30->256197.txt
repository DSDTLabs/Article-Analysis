New Delhi: The cutoffs for   (AUD) dipped by 3 to 5 percentage points for a few courses in the third list released on Friday evening. The   for BA (H) with majors in mathematics dipped by 5% points for humanities students from Delhi and 2.75% points for outstation students. For Delhi humanities students, the cutoff in history has been lowered by 3.5% points and that in English by 3% oints. 

 Maximum admissions are expected in the third list, said an administrative official. “We do not want to prolong the admission process further. We are looking for a good response in this list as many students are migrating from   as well,” he added. 
 
 Many students who couldn’t get the subject of their choice at DU are likely to check AUD. However, the dean of students welfare of AUD,  , said the DU cutoffs didn’t have any impact on the AUD process and the university depended solely on the merit of students seeking admissions.
 
 Other courses like BA (H) in economics and psychology saw a drop of only 1-1.25% points for arts students from Delhi as very few seats are available in these subjects. 
 
 Admission committiee members said economics and psychology were the most sought-after courses in the university and only two to three seats were available in these courses. The university introduced three vocational courses this year on retail management, tourism and hospitality, and early childhood centre management and entrepreneurship. These courses have found a good response from applicants and the second round of interviews has started for these courses.
