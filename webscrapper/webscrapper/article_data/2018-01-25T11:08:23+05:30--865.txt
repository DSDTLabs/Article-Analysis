PANAJI: Alarmed by the high number of crimes against the girl child and women in the country, the   Development Society has begun sensitizing students on   equality in Goa’s Salesian   and government schools in Karnataka and Maharashtra.

 Students of classes VIII, IX and XI are being made to attend four sessions on gender equality, promoting better relationships, mutual understanding and mutual respect between boys and girls.
 
 The students are being familiarized with the country’s sex ratio, gender stereotypes, female foeticide and infanticide, gender equality at home, in society, politics, religion, at the workplace, in school and among widows. Awareness is being created about the constitutional provisions and rights concerning women.
 
 Fr Laurence Monteiro, executive director   (KDS) said biases against women must go. The programme will help create awareness among children which is when they are most receptive. KDS spokesperson Nirmala Rebello said the programmes aims to create a sense of equity and awareness that boys and girls must have equal opportunities and access to facilities. It is trying to reach out to 2,000 children in the next four months.
