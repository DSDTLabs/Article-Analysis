PANAJI: The state government has decided that no   clearance (VC) would be issued to government employees who are either suspended or have first information reports (FIRs) filed against them. In all cases, the lists would mandatorily be revisited after a period of one year.

 The circular states that VCs will not be issued against government employees against whom chargesheets have been issued in disciplinary proceedings and the proceedings pending. 
 
 They also won’t be issued if orders for instituting disciplinary proceedings have been issued by the authority, unless the chargesheet is served within three months from the date of passing the order, or if a chargesheet has been filed in court by an investigation agency in a pending criminal case. 
 
 Director of vigilance   said that the clearance would not be issued to those officers against whom orders for instituting a criminal case have been issued under the Prevention of Corruption Act or any other criminal matter, or if an FIR has been filed or a case registered by the department concerned, or if the officer in question is involved in a trap/raid case on charges of corruption in which investigation is pending.
 
 The VC won’t normally be granted for a period of three years after the punishment if a minor penalty has been imposed. 
 
 In case of a major penalty, the VC won’t be granted for five years.
