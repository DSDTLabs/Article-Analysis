Panaji: More than two decades after losing to arch-rivals Bengal in the   final at home, Goa believed they could change the script but that was not to be at the GMC Athletic Stadium, Bambolim, on Sunday.
 
  In 1996, Goa were the favourites against Bengal but the visitors had the last laugh. On Sunday, Goa gave it their all in front of a packed stadium but late into extra time, they handed their dream and title to Bengal, who happily lifted it for the 32nd time.
  
  After months of hard work and planning, Goa coach   couldn’t hide his disappointment but put up a brave front, crediting the boys for reaching as far as the final.
  
  “We were right in the game for 120 minutes. The team were at it. Whatever instructions I gave, they did their best to execute it on the field. But I think it was a bit lack of focus in the end,” said Costa.
  
  After regulation time ended goalless and it looked like even extra time would not be enough to break the deadlock, Goa and Bengal were preparing for penalties when out of nowhere, Manvir Singh, one of the most promising player of the tournament, poked in from close range as custodian   was left helpless.
  
  This was Goa’s sixth defeat against Bengal in the final. Goa has drawn two and won just once in 2009 against their traditional rivals.
  
  Expectations were high after the hosts made it to the final with an impressive 2-1 win over Kerala. Striker   who was the star in that semifinals with a brace was marked heavily and whenever he had his feet on the ball, the 18-year-old failed to cut his way past Bengal’s sturdy defence. Young Aaren D’Silva had a chance early in the game but the ball landed on his weaker foot.
  
  “The chances you get in the match, you must always convert. But credit must go to the boys to take Goa in the final,” said Costa.
