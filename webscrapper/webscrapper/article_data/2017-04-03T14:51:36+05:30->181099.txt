   took to Twitter to share how brave her father was and what were his last words before he left the world. She shared a video of her father addressing the cancer patients, even though he was a cancer patient himself.
 
  The actress, who recently got married was a daddy's girl and was helped by husband Ronnit Biswas to overcome her dad's death.
  
  She shared the video on Twitter and wrote, "Fought cancer and it's 4 relapses in 3 years, endless pain but his few last words were "I'm absolutely fine" #inspiring #till #the #end #dad."
  
  
  
  Kavita, who was earlier in a relationship with Nawab Shah, broke up with him as her parents weren't happy about her getting settled with someone from another religion.
  
  
 
  
  She had earlier told TimesOfIndia.com that it was Ronnit Biswas who held her hand as she watched her father's pyre burn and they never let go off each other after that.
  
    had said, "My dad was all the things movies like 'Dabangg' and 'Singham' are made of, only more real. I've seen him fight for the country and serve the nation as a hero. The iconic character   in my show 'F.I.R.' was a complete rip off of my dad's real personality. He was the strongest man I knew emotionally and physically. I'd seen him take on 10 goons and emerge a winner."
