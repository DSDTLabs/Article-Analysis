NEW DELHI: Taking a dig at 
  at the Centre in 2019, information & broadcasting minister M   said on Wednesday the Congress vice-president was “daydreaming”.

 “I am surprised at the Congress vice-president’s claim of bringing ‘achhe din’ in 2019. What is ‘achhe din’ for Congress? Scams, scandals, policy paralysis, inactivity, inertia, rising prices, undermining every institution etc, are legacies of the Congress rule. Are these ‘achhe din’? Congress seems to be daydreaming about coming back to power in 2019.
 
 Forget 2019, it will not even be able to come back to power in 2090,” Naidu said in a statement. He also hit out at   leaders for their remarks against PM  , saying it is the “lowest that politicians can stoop to” and reflects their frustration over the growing popularity of the PM and BJP.
