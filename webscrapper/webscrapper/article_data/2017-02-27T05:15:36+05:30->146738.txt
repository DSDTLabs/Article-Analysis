 Ali Khan, along with   co-stars  ,  , and director  , was on the singing reality show Indian Idol on Monday. The actor, who's loves strumming the guitar, made use of a break between shots to jam with the band. Later, when the team egged him on to perform on stage, Saif obliged.

 'I don't know if I should have rehearsed more, I just played a generic tune. I can't sing to save my life but Shahid forced me into it, which is awful for the audience. It could make them tune out of the channel since I'm the worst singer,' he says self-depricatingly, informing that he played a minor blues scale which is a fairly simple progression. 'We jammed a bit, I played the lead, it was a simple guitar solo.'
 
 Speaking of music, Rangoon's songs have been doing well on the charts. Saif reveals that Vishal became a director just so he could picturise his songs which is his main passion.
 
 'Rangoon is a musical film. I love the background score and the song 'Bloody Hell'. The scale on which it is made and the way it was performed, with the sets, horses and fire, makes it look huge, like a big-stage performance,' he marvels.
