NEW DELHI: A day after the move to make   a ‘no-vehicle zone’ for three months was announced, the   decided to conduct a detailed survey on the flow of traffic. Traders, meanwhile, threatened to block the move.

 Officials said while battery-operated vehicles would be provided by the UD ministry for the purpose, DTC and Delhi Police have also been roped in to make the plan a success.
 
 A senior NDMC official told TOI: “The survey is necessary to understand the flow of traffic in the inner circle. This will give us an idea of how the connecting roads will be impacted when vehicles are banned in CP.” Sources in the corporation, however, said that before announcing the move, NDMC should have figured out the nitty-gritty. Traders associations, on their part, said they would soon meet CM   and MP Meenakshi Lekhi to convey their concerns. “This is a bizarre move. Connaught Place is a commercial area, which cannot be turned into a tourist destination. They can’t ruin our business,” said  , president of  .
 
 As per the plan, people coming to CP will have to park their vehicles at any of the three multilevel facilities and take a battery operated vehicle to reach inner circle. Around 3,172 cars can be accommodated at the   lots at Shivaji Stadium, Baba Kharak Singh Marg and Palika. On a daily basis, only 1,088 vehicles use them.
 
 Officials said the surface parking area won’t be dismantled for now. “Only if the plan is successful will the council do away with surface parking,” said an official.
