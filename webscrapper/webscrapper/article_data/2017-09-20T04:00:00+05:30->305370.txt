Vadodara: Sadhguru, who is travelling across the country as a part of Rally for Rivers campaign, met union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari who is also in charge of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation. He had stopped over in the city for a few hours on Tuesday evening as the rally was on its way to Ahmedabad. 

  “They talked for about 25 minutes on several issues including the river revivals and the rally,” said Dr Vinod Rao, municipal commissioner who accompanied Sadhguru along with mayor Bharat Dangar. Gadkari had recently said that the ambitious project of river inter-linking may start in three months. Sadhguru, who met eminent Barodians and nature lovers, appealed to leave a better world for the next generation. 
 
 “What will you leave for them? Money? Their future is not in money but the kind of earth we leave for them,” Sadhguru told the audience. 
 
 “Killing a river is like killing a nation. It’s not a small crime. We will come and go but the rivers have been around for millions of years,” he said. 
 
 “In many parts of the country there are 3 to 4 km long queues for getting water. One person has to spend entire day in queues. By 2030, our country will have only 50% of the water required for our survival. Rally for Rivers intends to revive and save our rivers,” Sadhguru added. 
 
 He added that the rally’s aim is to drive a national policy for rivers. 
 
 Sadhguru, who was invited by the Federation of Gujarat Industries (FGI) and Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), also said that there should be forestation for one km along banks of the big rivers and half-kilometre on small river banks on the government land. 
 
 “Farmers having land on the river banks can plant trees. Having plantations on the riverside can increase income of farmers manifold. 
 
 Padmashree awardee M H Mehta, who has been at forefront of Vaho Vishwamitri Abhiyan, also met Sadhguru and submitted the river’s revival proposal and plan.
