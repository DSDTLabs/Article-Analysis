NEW DELHI:   (PWD) has been asked to survey the entire city to identify locations where   are required. 

 A senior government official said that of the existing footbridges in the city, there are several that are barely used because of either poor designing or incorrect locations. A report will be submitted to the minister concerned in the coming week.
 
 The decision was taken during a review meeting of PWD held by minister   recently. Sources said that due to a high volume of traffic on the city’s roads, pedestrian safety had become a key component of planning. In a traffic review meeting held by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Thursday, pedestrian safety was a key area of discussion.
 
 Recently, TOI had highlighted the condition of foot overbridges made for the differently abled, most of which have been barricaded since the ramps were being used by two-wheelers. As a result of the knee-jerk reaction, the expensive footbridges can only be used by pedestrians, leading to a massive waste of public resources and denying the differently abled easy access to infrastructure.
 
 Taking in account the various issues plaguing the existing infrastructure, a senior official said that not only will they make efforts to rectify existing problems, but also to not repeat them, especially the locations of foot overbridges. “At present, many footbridges are not being used because they serve no purpose because of where they are located. They were also constructed due to political pressure. This was an utter waste of public funds. Now, all zones have been asked to survey their respective areas and identify locations where there is heavy pedestrian and vehicular movement. A report will be submitted to the secretary in another 10-odd days and then discussed with the minister,” said an official.
