AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the   recently acquitted two persons of atrocities charges that were registered against them in   in 2014.

 Harishchandra Chavan (78) and his son, Santosh, were booked by the   in Ambajogai taluka under the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Schedule Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989, following directions of the civil judge (junior division) for allegedly harassing   for 21 years to pressurize him to sell his land and for using abusive and threatening language against him.
 
 The duo challenged the registration of the offence as well as the civic judge’s order, through lawyer Sudarshan G Salunke, describing it as erroneous, illegal and not within the ambit of law. 
 
 The criminal application filed by the two farmers argued that the judge issued directions to police without hearing them. They argued that “it would cause injustice and prejudice to them as the order was also against the principal of natural justice”. They also pointed out to the high court that the civil judge, while exercising the powers of a civil court, has no authority to pass such an order under Section 156 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
 
 The matter came up for hearing before the bench comprising Justice S S Shinde and Justice K K Sonwane. On March 24, the judges pronounced the judgment allowing the application and quashing and setting aside the civil judge’s order dated May 2, 2014. 
 
 The civil judge had directed police to register an FIR against the two under the Scheduled Castes and Schedule Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and also under Section 506 with 34 of the Indian Penal Code, lawyer Salunke said.
