NAGPUR: If you make domestic animals lug around any material during scorching heat, you can be booked by the city police.

 In a unique case, cops have registered offences against two people who were using bulls to transport timber on Friday afternoon.
 
 As per the central government’s Prevention of Cruelty to Draught and Pack Animals Rules, 1965, no person is allowed to use any animal for carrying load or drawing vehicle between 12 and 3pm in areas where temperature exceeds 37 degree Celsius.
 
 On Friday, when the city’s maximum temperature was 44.5 degree Celsius, some bullock cart owners were caught breaching this rule. “Around 1.30pm, I saw these men with medium-sized bullocks which were carrying timber near Sudarshan Square,” said animal activist  .
 
 She alerted the police control room after which a team of officials from the Lakkadganj police station reached the spot and arrested cart owners Fagorao Darve and Sheikh Yusuf. “We have registered a first information report under sections of Prevention of Cruelty to Draught and Pack Animals Rules, 1965, and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960,” said head constable Ishwar Potdar. 
 
 Galani added that the animals were carrying more luggage than the permissible weight mentioned in the rules.
 
 With heatwave grappling the region, activists are demanding strict implementation of rules. “Recently in Gwalior, the district collector has issued orders that no animal will be made to work between 12 and 3pm. We will be requesting Nagpur’s district collector to take similar steps,” said Galani.
