BENGALURU: Industry captains want the new coalition government to focus on rebuilding Brand Bengaluru which has taken a beating in recent years due to infrastructure issues.

 
 Former   CFO and AAP member V Balakrishnan said the government must give priority to building Brand Bengaluru, which is integral to   and India. “It should directly elect a mayor for a five-year term so that there is accountability and responsibility to position Bengaluru as a global city. Successive governments have neglected the city. Improving governance in Bengaluru should be on their priority list.”
 
  MD Kamal Bali said the industry is keen on a government which is stable, has a predictable and progressive policy regime and continues with good policies of the previous government. Such policies, Bali added, include focus on IT/BT and the thriving startup ecosystem.
 
 “The new government needs to partner with industry, embrace technology to reskill and create jobs for the youth,” he said.
 
 
 
 At the same time, he cautioned that the capital has to be decongested and infrastructure and connectivity improved.
 
 “Bengaluru is the magnet and there is huge competition from other states. This government needs to stay ahead and get more investments,” said Bali.
 
 Geetanjali Kirloskar, director, Kirloskar Systems, said the new government should focus on stability and good governance. “And, of course, development. They should remember they have formed it to build the state and that alone.”
