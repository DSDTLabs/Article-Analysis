PANAJI: Essential life-saving medicines must be given free of cost in India, said renowned gynaecologist and   (IMA) member Dr Kedar  . He was speaking at an IMA conference in   on Saturday. 

 “Any person who has a problem which is life threatening shouldn’t die just because they cannot afford the medicine,” he said. 
 
 He said that diseases like gastroentritis, urinary infection, tuberculosis, and cancers are very common in Goa. Providing an overview of drug prices, he said that medication for a simple common cold can cost anywhere between Rs 300 to Rs 3,000 for a single prescription, depending on its severity.
 
 When it comes to cancer, oncologist Dr   said that one simple chemo cycle costs Rs 1,000, while the complicated ones may even go up to Rs 2.5 lakh. 
 
 “I have told the IMA that they should approach the government and collaborate with the directorate of health services and   to start a pharmacy where free drugs should be given for life-threatening ailments,” Padte said.
