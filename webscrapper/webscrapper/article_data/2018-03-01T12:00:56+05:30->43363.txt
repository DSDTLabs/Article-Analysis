PUNE: Extended halting of vehicles at the pick-and-drop points of the Pune railway station may soon cost you. 
 
  
 Pune divisional railway manager (DRM)   on Wednesday said a new system was being planned, under which vehicles coming towards both the entries of the   to pick up or drop off passengers will be charged if they waited at the same spot for more than 10 minutes. 
  
 The move, on the lines of the system followed at the Pune airport, aims to control the crowd and ensure order at the Pune Junction. “Though there are designated parking lots near the pick-and-drop points, it has been often observed that people tend to wait in their vehicles for passengers. This blocks the whole area, thus, inconveniencing others,” Deouskar said. 
  
 The main entry of the Pune station has got a parking lot. The area also has a specific place for the parking of four-wheelers. The same arrangement is in place at the second entry towards  , which was opened for public last year. 
  
 “Those found halting their vehicles along the pick-and-drop zones for more than 10 minutes will have to pay certain charges, which are yet to be finalized. People who think that they will need more than 10 minutes to pick up and drop off passengers can park their vehicles in the designated parking lots,” a railway official said. 
  
 The official said if the vehicle owners resist, tough action will be taken. “Besides imposing a fine, vehicles of such people will be towed away,” he added. 
  
 Passengers, on their part, said the rail authorities should first make the parking contractors to pull up their socks. “It is a good plan but the fact remains that the contractors of the parking lots loot passengers by charging them anything they want. If people resist, the contractors become rude and even violent. The authorities should first make these contractors follow regulations,”  , a city resident, said.
