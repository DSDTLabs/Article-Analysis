MANDYA: The Gauri Lankesh murder case seems to be getting murkier as the elder brother and friends of accused   alias Hotte Manja, currently being interrogated by the   (SIT), alleged they were illegally arrested and tortured by police to testify against Naveen. 

 Naveen's elder brother   told TOI there's an attempt being made to frame his brother in the case for political gain and police are trying to save faces by falsely implicating Naveen. He said the story that   was picked from Majestic area in Bengaluru with a gun and live bullets was concocted and it was an attempt by the SIT to portray him as a facilitator who allegedly helped the yet-to-be-identified killers of Gauri.
 
 "The police claim that my brother was arrested from Majestic on February 18 is a lie. He was arrested from his house in Birur, Chikkamagaluru district on February 14. Nobody, including his wife, knew of the arrest. To trace my brother, I was advised by my advocate to file a habeas corpus petition in the high court. In the meantime, police told Naveen's wife to come to the police station, informing her that he'd been arrested," Timmegowda claimed.
 
 When he asked why Naveen was arrested, police told him it was for possessing illegal firearms. "Later, I came to know about the larger conspiracy to implicate him in the Gauri Lankesh murder case. My brother is a patriot fighting for the Hindu cause," he said.
