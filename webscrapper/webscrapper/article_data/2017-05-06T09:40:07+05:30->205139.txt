Even though the home ministry on Friday clarified that the communication to   was a “routine query put to all political parties from time to time”, AAP was quick to allege a witch hunt by the Modi government. 

 In its communication, the home ministry directed the Arvind Kejriwal-led party to explain certain funding from abroad, based on suspicion that the party may have violated FCRA provisions. 
 
 The ministry clarified that the communication was part of its “routine” queries sent to a few other political parties as well on overseas funding. Officials made it clear that it was not a show cause notice and a decision on the same would be taken only after AAP submitted its reply.
 
 Reacting to the Centre's move, AAP said it was a clear case of “political witch hunt”, which was very “dangerous” for democracy.
 
 “It is a clear case of political witch hunt. All the agencies at the Centre’s disposal have been unleashed against Aam Aadmi Party, its government in Delhi and its ministers which is very dangerous for democracy,” it said in a statement.
 
 AAP said it had nothing to hide and was prepared to face any probe and fully cooperate with all officials and agencies concerned. Kerjiwal’s party made it a point to mention that though the home ministry had earlier given AAP a clean chit before the Delhi High Court on this issue, “they are now sending us fresh notices”.
