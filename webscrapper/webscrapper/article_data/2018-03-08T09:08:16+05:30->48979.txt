 Practical Action has also started Sunolo Sakhi, a knowledge-delivery project designed specifically to bridge the knowledge gap about menstruation and adolescent hygiene, in 60 slums of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. As part of the project, several young girls from the Sakhi Clubs created in these slums helped others in their vicinity and schools understand menstrual hygiene through radio programmes and by answering their questions. The organization, which works with people with disabilities, had earlier brought out audio books on various topics for young visually challenged girls and video books in sign language for hearing and speech impaired girls of the state.
