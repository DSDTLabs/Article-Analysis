JHANSI/BHOPAL: Union minister and former   CM   announced on Sunday evening that she won’t contest elections any more.

 She also said was not a contender for the chief minister’s post in Madhya Pradesh, where assembly polls are scheduled at the end of the year. Citing health issues, she said she won’t be in the fray in the 2019   polls from her constituency, Jhansi, or anywhere else.
 
 After coming to Bhopal on Monday, she confined herself indoors and refused to speak to the media. Asked about her health, her media manager Manoj Dwivedi said she was ailing and was taking rest. “Didi has fever. She is not meeting anybody though messages are pouring in. She will respond after recovering from the fever,” he said. It was while talking to reporters after a development review meeting on Sunday that the firebrand leader made the surprise announcement.
 
 
 
 I have conveyed my wishes to the party leadership not to force me to contest the next elections because my health condition doesn’t permit me. I have serious knee and back problems because of which my movements are becoming restricted. Even during the previous Lok Sabha election campaign, I had to use helicopter due to these problems,” said  . “At 54, I am no longer fit for hectic and active political work. I will not contest any more elections but will continue to work for the party and campaign for the   elections in MP,” Bharti added.
 
 Expressing gratitude to the people of Bundelkhand for their unconditional support, she said that she was not personally satisfied with developmental work in her constituency as she was unable to give proper time. Bharti, a former Madhya Pradesh CM, shifted to UP in 2012 assembly elections when she won from Charkhari in Mahoba.
