Jalpaiguri: Septuagenarian Ashim Chakraborty is always in an ecstatic mood while narrating stories from his childhood. He has vivid memories of almost everything.

 So when a locomotive from   station reached   station on Wednesday and continued its onward journey towards the Bangladesh border, it revived many memories of the train that used to then ply between India and East Pakistan. Wednesday’s loco operation was a test run for the Haldibari-Chilahati railway route that had shut down in 1965 and is now about to be revived. 
 
 Haldibari is a town in Bengal’s Cooch Behar district while Chilahati is a border station in Bangladesh, situated in   district. 
 
 Chakraborty wasn’t alone to witness the trial run. Hundreds from adjoining towns and villages turned up to witness history being rewritten.
 
 Indian Railways has already built 4.5km new track from Haldibari staion to the border. Bangladesh Railways now needs to complete the remaining 7.5km from the border to Chilahati station for train services to resume. 
 
 In 2011, India and Bangladesh had inked a pact during Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina’s visit to India for opening new rail links.
 
 Haldibari is the terminal station for trains such as Haldibari-Kolkata Superfast Express, Teesta Torsha Express and Darjeeling Mail. Prior to 1965, trains would pass through Haldibari and enter Chilahati in former East Pakistan via which it travelled to Kolkata. But after Indo-Pak war in 1965, it was closed. 
 
 “Work is going on at Haldibari station that will be a terminal station. Looplines will also be laid at Jalpaiguri town station,” a senior   official said.
