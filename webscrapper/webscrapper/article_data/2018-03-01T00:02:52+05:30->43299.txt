THANE: Forest officials are leaving no stone unturned to ensure that there are no forest fire cases on  . Right from night vigils to restricting people entering  , the officials are doing every thing to avoid such incidents from taking place. 
 
 As the demand of timber increased on Holika dahan, which is a day before Holi,   living in Yeoor chop trees to sell logs in the markets. Officials claim that many even burn the roots of the trees to weaken them before chopping them down. 
  
 “For the Adivasi community, Holi is an occasion to make money. So, they chop trees and sell logs, which is illegal. While some cut thin trees, others start a fire to weaken the roots. This can lead to a forest fire,” said a forest official. 
  
 “As this is the season of the shedding of leaves, it only acts as a fuel to fire. The temperature, which is close to 40 degrees Celsius these days, helps the fire spread faster, which could spell disaster to the flora and fauna,” he added. 
  
 The forest department had started night vigils in the forest and has also requested citizen’s for their support. “We carry out four rounds in the forest—Yeoor, Nagla, Chena and Ghodbunder. We have created four teams which is responsible to carry out surveillance of each place as hacking takes place only at night,” said a forest official.
