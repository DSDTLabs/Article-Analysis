BEIJING: Monks at the famous   temple, the birthplace of kung fu, have entered entertainment wrestling to fight along with Japanese and American wrestlers.

 
 The monks and other practitioners of Chinese kung fu are being supported by a Shanghai-based entertainment wrestling organiser, the Oriental Wrestling Entertainment, which has added kung fu elements like twists and turns to traditional Western-style wrestling. “We are the translators, we try to tell the world about Chinese kung fu through the platform of wrestling,” the   quoted the organissation’s vice-president   as saying.
 
 The company inducts kung fu practitioners and trains them in wrestling before sending them to rings to fight. The kung fu wrestlers debut event last February got 400 million hits on the QQ social media platform.
 
 Nee said the company is engaged in talks with the Chinese government for permission to incorporate kung fu in wrestling. “We talked to government people, they gave us direction. We will use this to spread Chinese martial arts culture to the world, to make our young Chinese generation go for martial arts.”
