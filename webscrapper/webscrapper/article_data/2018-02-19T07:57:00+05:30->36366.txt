Ludhiana: To keep a clear head, examiners advise students to avoid discussions and brainstorming a day before any paper of the ongoing Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) board examination. The practicals of CISCE are over and the mainstream theory exams have already started with Accounts paper on Thursday.

 The schools which have Class XII in Ludhiana are Sat Paul Mittal School, Springdale Senior School, Sanatan Vidya Mandir Senior Secondary School, Sacred Heart Higher Secondary Convent School and Sacred Heart Convent School.
 
 “I would suggest that students should only go for revisions before the exams and should be relaxed. Most importantly, they should not talk to their classmates much and even if they do, they should not discuss about the preparations. If it is found out through the discussion that the other student has missed out on any of the important topic, he or she will only panic and waste time, as nothing much can be prepared at the last moment. They will only end up confusing themselves,” said Monika Malik, a teacher at Sat Paul Mittal School.
 
 In Sat Paul Mittal School, students are made to follow the board exam pattern from junior class so that they are not overtly excited or tensed when they are in Class X and XII. “If we help the students, they can get familiar with what is expected and this familiarity with the exam and study pattern helps in taking out the stress from students. This allows the students to work on their skills. They are trained as how to appear for the exam by the way of monthly tests throughout the year. The term paper looks the same as the board’s paper,” said Premjeet Kaur, a teacher at Sat Paul Mittal School.
