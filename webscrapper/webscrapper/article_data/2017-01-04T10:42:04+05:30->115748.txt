Phagwara: As Punjab BJP president Vijay Sampla’s ‘Vijay Sankalp Rath Yatra’ reached Phagwara on Tuesday evening it became an occasion for bringing out in the open the factionalism in Phagwara unit of the party. Angry slogans were exchanged between supporters of   and former SAD MLA Mohan Lal Banga, who has recently joined BJP and is now state executive member of the party and a ticket aspirant from the seat.

 While Banga and his supporters welcomed Sampla’s Rath Yatra at Vishavkarma Mandir, Som Parkash and his supporters had organized a separate stage at a distance of over one kilometre near Basra Palace, where local SAD leaders were also present. The tension between the two groups was palpable as Banga’s supporters started passing from near Som Parkash’s venue as they raised slogans of ‘Mohan Lal Zindabad’, ‘Mohal Lal will win’ and ‘Mohan Lal di balle balle baaki saare thalle thalle’.
 
 On this Som Parkash’s supporters also responded with angry slogans of same type. Senior BJP leaders and police officials present prevented the situation from turning ugly by ensuring that young supporters of both sides would not come face to face.
 
 In his speech Som trained his guns on “party hoppers” and “chamchas” (sycophants) saying that they would not get any respect from the party high command and only “vikas” (development) would get the ticket. Banga was also present when Som was speaking. A few local office bearers who have been openly opposing him were also present on the rath with Sampla. 
 
 Banga is son of former BJP minister and Chaudhary Swarna Ram who represented Phagwara constituency twice. In last election he was replaced with Som Parkash.
