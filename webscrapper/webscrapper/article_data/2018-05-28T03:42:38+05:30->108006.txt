NEW DELHI: The government seems open to reviewing its recent decision to allow unrestricted civilian access to all roads in the 62 cantonments in the country, which has led to protests from military personnel and their families on the ground that the move has adversely affected security. 

 
 Wives of military officers in different cantonments have come together to protest against the decision announced on May 20, and have even drafted a letter to defence minister Nirmala   to ask her to reverse the order, as was first reported by TOI. Taking note of the signature campaign launched by the wives of officers, Sitharaman tweeted on Sunday, “(They are) welcome to meet me. Shall hear them with an open mind.” 
 
 The directive to “re-open all closed roads” in the cantonments, in any case, is to reviewed after a month of monitoring traffic on 87 roads and examining security concerns, said officials. The defence ministry took the decision after consulting with   chief General  , defence secretary   and other officials.
