He has managed to create his own brand of suspense thrillers centred around Byomkesh Bakshi and Shabar Dasgupta, and how! But then again, Arindam Sil doesn’t like to be branded as a thriller-maker; and he told CT that he plans to break that stereotype this year itself. Of course, the filmmaker spoke about a plethora of other things, including why politics has taken a backseat in life now, in a candid chat with us. Excerpts:       Fantastic and rejuvenating! I needed a break as I’d been working very hard for the past few months. But honestly, relaxation is my way of switching over from one project to another. Moreover, standing quietly in front of a mountain or the sea makes you realise that you’re a mere puppet in front of nature. That helps me stay grounded.        Yes, my Byomkesh was with us on this trip. Abir is now a part and parcel of my life.        I’ve nothing to say on this. Be it an actor, a politician or an ordinary person, everyone has to pay a price for being dishonest. That’s karma. On the other hand, honesty enriches you as a human being. That’s exactly what I’ve taught my daughter too.        Oh yes! Can’t thank god enough for that. From money, fame to peace, 2016 has given me all. I feel Eagoler Chokh and Byomkesh Pawrbo were the only two films of 2016 that did good business and at the same time, received critical acclaim. Bickram (Ghosh) called me up the other day to say a critic like Nilakhho Gupta loved Byomkesh Pawrbo. It has, in fact, surpassed the figures of Har Har Byomkesh.        True, Praktan was a huge hit. On the critical front, however, many said Belaseshe was a better film. But when it comes  to Eagoler Chokh and Byomkesh Pawrbo, both did good business and earned critical appreciation.  Double Feluda and Byomkesh Pawrbo released at the same time in December and many said business-wise, Feluda was ahead of Byomkesh. With all due respect to Sandip Ray, Feluda is a huge brand, especially for kids. But children can’t go and watch Feluda alone at a theatre, so parents or grandparents accompany them, ensuring more ticket sales. But that doesn’t really matter to me. What matters is that my film earned profits as well as critical acclaim.        (Laughs) Other directors also made Byomkesh films. Why can’t we talk about those films? Why are only Har Har Byomkesh and Byomkesh Pawrbo spoken about? A section of people also say that good stories and simple films work. I don’t understand it. Cinema toh sruti natok noy! Cinema has to have a soul.        Yes, the next Byomkesh will happen in 2018. This year, we’ll make Shabar, and Saswata Chatterjee will play the sleuth. He has to lose weight for that and he has promised me that he will.        (Laughs) I’ll prove I’m more than that in 2017. My next films may be on stories by Samaresh Majumdar and Humayun Ahmed. The problem here is that we can’t praise others. One actually needs to be confident about themselves before praising others. And people here are too insecure. I protested when Q said, ‘F*ck Manik’! He can’t say that about a stalwart. Again, when someone does good work, I do support them.        (Laughs) They were at the café, chilling with others, so the media missed them at the premiere. I guess our honeymoon period got over long ago, when I proved my worth as a filmmaker to them with my first film. As a director, I’ve given them the maximum returns and at the same time, I’m also thankful to them for believing in me. This year, I have to create a lot of original content for their web series as the creative head. Just the other day, Shrikant and Nispal (Singh) told me that I’m only the director who’s given them the highest ratio of return. I consider it a huge compliment.        I’m talking about the last two years. You can cross-check with them if you want.        Demonetisation doesn’t mean a lack of money; just the amount of liquid cash has gone down. So, one can always write a cheque (laughs). We shot Durga Sohay in 15 days, working in 38 shifts! It was a gruelling experience for my team. So, I guess they deserved a party to unwind.        Not exactly. True, I was angry, as both came in late for the shoot and that affected work. And I told them that in front of others, as no one has the right to disrupt a shoot by being late. Not even me.      I’m always into cinema. The Durga Sohay shoot might have happened now, but the planning was done a year back. I will start shooting for the film on Dhananjoy Chatterjee soon, but the homework for it began six months back. I have this superb workaholic team that’s constantly doing research for my films. We work hard, but party harder.        Amazing facts on Dhananjoy are coming up during our research. We came across a police officer whose only fixation is to convict the person who he thinks is wrong. No matter what, if he feels a person is wrong, he’ll go to any extent to prove him guilty. We’re yet to lock the actors as the final script is not ready. But we do have Sudiptaa Chakraborty in mind as Hetal Parekh’s mother. We are auditioning new faces for Hetal’s character. Harsh Chhaya will be playing a pivotal role.        I’m acting on the sets every day while showing my actors how to enact a scene. That apart, there comes a time in life where you have to decide what your priorities are. For me it’s direction now. Even my interest in politics has taken a back seat.  But you were very close to our present government and were actively seen participating in political programmes...  I’m on good terms with Didi (CM Mamata Banerjee) and I respect her a lot. But I’ve never interacted with her with a desire to become a politician.        I took care of the responsibilities I was entrusted with. There’s a saying nothing is permanent,  be it good or bad times. So does that bother you? I think I’ve crossed the bad times of my life. When I see former king makers living in small prison cells now, I thank god for whatever he’s given me till date. So, I pray to god to keep me grounded so that I can hang on to this good phase.
