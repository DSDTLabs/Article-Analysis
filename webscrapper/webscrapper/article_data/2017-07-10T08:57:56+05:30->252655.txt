KENDRAPADA: Fifteen cows in three trucks died due to alleged suffocation at Sathipur Chhack on   on Saturday night. The animals were being taken from Jajpur to Kolkata. Members of Bajrang Dal intercepted the trucks, which, they alleged, were carrying cows and calves illegally. 

 Police have seized all three trucks but the drivers managed to flee. The animals were allegedly tightly packed in the vehicles. "There was no space left for cattle to move their heads," said Sarat Chandra Patra, inspector in charge of Panikoili police station.
