LUCKNOW: Principal secretary home Debashish Panda and   Sulkhan Singh will visit   on Sunday to find cause of the recent caste and communal   in the district. The two officers will interact with the locals and deliberate on steps required to ensure that such incidents do not repeat.

 “We will look into the causes of these incidents, response of the administration and also try to set the tone for a permanent solution to the issues by meeting the locals,” Panda told TOI, adding that the exercise was aimed at sorting out the dispute once and for all.
 
 Apart from the two incidents, the teams will also review law and order situation in Saharanpur range which includes Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts. The two officers will brief authorities on priorities of the Yogi government on the law and order front. “The line to be followed is very clear–no one should be allowed to take law in their hands, irrespective of their public image,” said DGP Sulkhan Singh.
 
 On Friday, a 35-year-old man was killed and 16 persons injured seriously while dozens of houses were torched after clashes broke out between members of the Thakur and Dalit communities in Shabbirpur village following a dispute over taking out a procession in memory of Rajput ruler Maharana Pratap. The two sides had been at loggerheads for almost three months now over installation of an Ambedkar statue in the village, which was also allegedly damaged in the Friday violence. Earlier, on April 20, members of two communities had clashed at Sadak Doodhli over a procession in memory of B R Ambedkar.
