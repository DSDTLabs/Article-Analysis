Trichy: Tourism minister Vellamandi N Natarajan refuted allegations that he tried to prevent a public meeting by T T V Dhinakaran against NEET. Meanwhile, arrangements for the public meeting are in full swing following the Madras High Court’s order directing the city police to allow TTV to hold the same on September 19.

 Speaking to reporters after inaugurating a gym in ward number 22 in the city, Natarajan denied the charges levelled by TTV supporters that he was blocking the proposed public meeting at Uzhavar Sandhai grounds in the city. “Neither me nor the Edappadi K Palaniswami government tried to prevent the public meeting of TTV Dhinakaran at the venue against NEET. We are travelling on the democratic path. The meeting will be held on September 19 at the same place and it is an example for that,” he said.
 
 Earlier in the day, the minister inaugurated a gym built at an estimated cost of Rs 9lakh under the MLAs Local Area Development Scheme. Natarajan urged residents to utilise the facility.
 
 Minister for backward classes and minorities welfare S Valarmathu, Trichy MP M Kumar, corporation chief engineer Amuthavalli and other officials participated.
