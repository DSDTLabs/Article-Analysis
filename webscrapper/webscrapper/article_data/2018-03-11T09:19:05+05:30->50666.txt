TRICHY: A baby that was left abandoned at the   ( ) government hospital here a few months ago is yet to be claimed by anyone. Even though the baby was handed over to an adoption centre more than a month back, district collector   has said that the baby can be still claimed by the parents.

 The new born male infant was abandoned soon after delivery at the comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care at the MGM government hospital on November 24, 2017. The doctors and staff at the hospital made attempts to trace the mother, but turned futile as the contact address provided at the hospital was wrong. The district social welfare office (DSWO) was informed about the incident subsequently. 
 
 Since the baby required medical care, the baby was kept under observation for one-and-half-months at the hospital. On improvement, the doctors handed over the baby to the district social welfare office which arranged to hand over the baby under the   cradle scheme. 
 
  district administration chose the specialised adoption centre run by   foundation in Madurai for the care and protection of the baby. Collector K Rajamani formally handed over the baby to the foundation on February 12. 
 
  The claimants can contact chairperson of child welfare committee (CWC), Trichy, at 9942276404 or district child protection officer at 9047283819.
