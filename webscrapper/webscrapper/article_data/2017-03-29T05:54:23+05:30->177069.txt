CHENNAI: State-run universities in   are facing a leadership crunch. The Madurai Kamarajar University hasn’t had a vice-chancellor for almost three years now and University of Madras (UOM) hasn’t had one for a year and three months now. 

 The Association of University Teachers (AUT) is worried that the   in Salem might also go down the same road, as the term of vice-chancellor is scheduled to end in four months and no search-panel has been appointed by the state government.
 
 Academic and administrative issues in   and UOM have come to a standstill as crucial decisions right from having a convocation to buying instruments for laboratories have been stuck due to lack of VCs. Search panels have been appointed for selecting VCs in both these universities, but no names have been submitted to the Governor, who is the Chancellor of state universities.
 
  “We are worried that Periyar University will also go down the same road. It has led to a complete breakdown. The state needs to take urgent action,” said AUT general secretary N Pasupathy.
 
 Periyar University is facing a crisis as annual accounts have not been presented for the past three years to the senate and no annual report has been tabled.
 
 A senior official in the higher education department said they were aware of these issues and actively pursuing it.
 
 “We want to ensure that search panels are constituted in such a manner that nobody can raise any allegations against its credentials in future. We will constitute a search panel for Periyar University soon,” the official said.
 
 UOM has been plagued by financial issues. But its administrative functions are being salvaged by a full syndicate, the highest decision making body of the University.
 
 However in MKU, the syndicate is also half empty as many appointments have to be made by a VC. The search panel for the University’s VC selection has been mired in controversies.
