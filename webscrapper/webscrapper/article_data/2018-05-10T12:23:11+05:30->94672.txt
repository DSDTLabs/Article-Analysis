ALWAR: In a major embarrassment for the Alwar police, a   constable posted at Kherli police station has alleged that station house officer (SHO) used derogatory and caste based remarks while harassing him.

 
 Constable   gave a complaint to Jaipur IG   about his ordeal and alleged that Kherli SHO Umesh   has been harassing him. The IG has directed a senior deputy SP ( ) level officer to investigate the matter.
 
 In his complaint to the IG, Singh alleged that Beniwal asked him to bring the details of the suspects involved in violence that prevailed during the SC/ST Bharat Bandh on April 2. “When I replied that people have fled from the village and nobody is present at the spot, he got angry and abused me. He also made caste based remarks against me,” he said.
 
 The complainant said that after the incident, SHO refused to grant him leave even when he requested that he was sick and needed medical treatment. Singh even alleged that Beniwal stocked tensions during the April 2 call for Bharat Bandh and provoked shopkeepers not to shut shops.
 
 Beniwal however, has refuted the allegations and claimed that the constable never gave any complaint to him. “I am not aware of any such complaint,” Beniwal said.
 
 Senior officials have said that the matter is serious and hence, an investigation is being carried out into the case. “The allegations made by the accused are of a serious nature and need to be probed. A senior DSP will look into the complaint. Singh has also alleged that Umesh Beniwal did not call members of Dalit community for CLG meeting,” the official said, adding that Singh’s statements will be recorded.
