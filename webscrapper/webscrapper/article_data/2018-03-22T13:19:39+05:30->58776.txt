TRICHY: A 32-year-old civil engineer succumbed to his injuries after falling off a running train in the early hours of Wednesday. He was on his way from   to Chennai on the Pothigai superfast express.

 According to police, the deceased was identified as J Moses Jebasing of   in Kodaikanal, Dindigul district. He had boarded the express train at Dindigul railway station and, as it was crowded, he had been sitting near the door. When the train was nearing Manapparai station, he accidentally fell down, according to a co-passenger who also informed the 108 ambulance service subsequently.
 
 Since it was dark, the co-passenger could not clearly pinpoint the exact location where the victim had fallen. This left the attenders in the ambulance clueless on the exact spot, police said.   (GRP) officials said that the incident happened around 12 am, but the police came to know about the incident only after an hour. Since it was pitch dark, no one could locate Moses. His body was identified around 4 am by the ambulance and police personnel.
 
 Had the victim been rescued immediately, either by the attenders of the ambulance or by the RPF personnel on board, he could have been rescued within a few hours and he might not have lost his life, co-passengers said. Meanwhile, the body was sent to Manapparai government hospital for post-mortem. Railway police have registered a case and investigations are on.
