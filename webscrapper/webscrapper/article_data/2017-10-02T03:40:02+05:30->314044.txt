Thane:   leader Jitendra Awhad on Sunday said that he would stage the ‘mother of all protests’ at Kalwa railway station on Tuesday to demonstrate against the “casual approach’’ of Central Railway authorities towards safety of suburban commuters.

 The local unit here plans to rally at the busy station from 8.30am, which will trigger a massive hold-up of train movement and disrupt schedules.
 
 Plans are being finalised for NCP chief Sharad Pawar’s rail commute this week, where he will meet regular commuters to understand their woes and inadequate infrastructure.
 
 “The authorities are indifferent to the safety of commuters here. The stretch between Diva and Kalwa can be called a ‘killer stretch’ as two or more people fall off crowded trains and die on tracks daily. In fact, a day before the   tragedy, four persons fell off a local as it was approaching Kalwa and only one survived,’’ said Awhad.
 
 The NCP legislator from Mumbra-Kalwa constituency said rising fatalities were due to the failure of the CR administration to cater to rush hour crowds.
 
 “The population of Diva-Kalwa-Mumbra has risen 1,200 times in the last decade but train services and facilities at the station remain much the same. These commuters contribute to the bulk of revenue for CR but our demand for a Diva local has been gathering dust. Adequate care has not been taken by CR to deal with peak hour crowds from these stations,’’ Awhad said.
 
 He added that the   is to voice long-pending demands and to hold the administration accountable for deaths on tracks.
