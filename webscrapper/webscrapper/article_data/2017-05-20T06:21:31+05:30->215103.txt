CHANDRAPUR: The full-grown   that had mauled five villagers in   village in   range was captured in the cage late on Thursday night. It was released into a distant forest having good prey base within few hours of the being rescued. 

 The leopard was lurking in the fields around the village after the attack. It took shelter in a pipe under a bridge when the rescue operation began in the afternoon.

 Rescue workers tried to push the beast towards the cage but it did not respond. After the crowd receded, the leopard walked on its own into the cage at around 11pm. 
 
 Wildlife veterinary officer, TATR, Dr   examined the leopard. As no injuries marks were found on its body, forest officials, Dr Khobragade and honorary wildlife warden Bandu Dhotre released it into the wild during the wee hours of Friday, sources said.
