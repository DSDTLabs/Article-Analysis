AHMEDABAD: In 2017, an average of 3,000 Amdavadis daily, or two vehicle riders per minute, were fined for not wearing helmet. The number shot dramatically upwards compared to 2016, primarily thanks to the monitoring by CCTVs installed on   as part of City Surveillance and Intelligent Traffic Management System (CISTMS) project. 

 While the majority of the e-challans are yet to be paid, the offence for not wearing helmet alone amounted to Rs 20.74 crore, higher than fines for all other categories of offences combined. For the helmet-related offences, 88.42% or 9.70 lakh cases were identified through   monitoring.
 
 “Illegal parking was the second major category that saw registration of 3.34 lakh offences. Sustained drives were carried out to identify the trouble spots in both eastern and western city parts as the offenders were fined with documentary evidence. Driving without seat belt and breaking the signal or traffic sign were other major offences recorded in 2017,” said a senior city traffic police official. Traffic branch of the city police along with other branches of the state government concluded the Road Safety Week on Monday.
 
 Talking about the road safety challenges of the city, traffic branch officials said that a number of infrastructural projects are expected to change the traffic composition of the city. “We are working closely with the civic bodies to identify the parking spaces, enforcing parking policies for the commercial and residential buildings and strengthen traffic management at the major crossroads. A number of roads have reached its maximum carrying capacity,” said an official.
