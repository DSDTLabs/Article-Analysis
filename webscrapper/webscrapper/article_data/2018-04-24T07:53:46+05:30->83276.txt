LUCKNOW: Courageous and timely action by a woman led to the arrest of a man who was harassing her online.

 The woman, a teacher, was also distantly related to the accused. An accountant in a private bank,   was arrested for blackmailing his niece on   for money.
 
 The 28-year-old woman reported the matter to the cyber cell of   police and registered an FIR in   police station on April 16.
 
 Nodal officer Abhay   said Agarwal (30) had made a fake Facebook account in the name of the woman. He had posted morphed photographs of her along with obscene remarks on the Facebook pages of those who were friends with the woman.
 
 On April 14, the woman got to know through her friends that somebody was using her profile for offensive posts. “She got to know through the phone number on the profile that her own relative Agarwal was doing it. She confronted Agarwal but he remained defiant,” police said. From April 16, Agarwal began demanding money and threatened to put her pictures on other social media, said the police.
 
 “After the woman’s complaint, we first sent a complaint to Facebook about the fake profile,” said Mishra. “We told the woman not to tell Agarwal anything and keep him waiting for the demands to be fulfilled,” said Mishra.
 
 When investigation led to Agarwal’s arrest, he confessed that he had thought of the plan to make money since the woman was a teacher in a prestigious school and earned a good income. He had not expected her to complain about him.
