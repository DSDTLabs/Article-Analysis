Noida mountaineer   is currently on his way to conquering India's highest mountain peak – the treacherous Kanchenjunga. The 8,586m high peak is considered to be one of the toughest peaks in the world and has one of the highest death rates. However, Arjun seems to have found a way to beat the stress by performing acrobatic yoga at a height of over 18,000 feet (about 5,500m) above sea level.

  The Noida resident had left for Kathmandu – where the base camp is located – to begin the expedition in early April, and is expected to summit Kanchenjunga sometime in mid-May. Talking about his idea of doing yoga at a height of over 18,000 feet, Arjun's mother Priya tells us, "He has always been a practitioner of yoga, and regularly performs it during a climb to stay fit and focused. This time, a lot of foreign climbers have joined him for the expedition, and when they saw him doing yoga, they also started doing it along with him. It has now become a group activity for them, and they are doing it regularly."
 
  
  
 
  Arjun holds the distinction of being the youngest Indian to reach the summit of Mount Everest, a feat that he achieved at the age of 17. Since then, he has scaled four other mountain peaks, all of which stand over 8,000m. Arjun is now aiming to be the youngest person to complete the True Explorers' Grand Slam – climbing all the 14 peaks that are over 8,000m in altitude. At 24, he has already summitted five of these, with Kanchenjunga being the sixth.
