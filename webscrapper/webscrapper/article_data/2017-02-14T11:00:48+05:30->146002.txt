Actor Robert Downey Jr and filmmaker   are teaming up for an untitled feature, which is based on the episode 'Man of the People' from Gimlet Media's 'Reply All podcast'. 

 The 51-year-old actor will also produce the project under his Team Downey banner, while Linklater will helm him in a real-life con man story.
 
  
  
 The podcast tells the true story of two doctors, Dr  , who scammed his way to fame and fortune using fake medicine, populism and radio, and Dr Morris Fishbein, the editor of the journal of the America Medical Association who goes on a decade-long quest to take Brinkley down. 
 
 However, Downey will next be seen as his Marvel alter-ego,  , in this summer's ' : Homecoming'.
