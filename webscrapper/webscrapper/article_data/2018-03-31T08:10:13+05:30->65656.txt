BENGALURU: Festivities of  , one of the oldest community festivals of the city, culminate with the   Shaktyotsava, the ceremonial procession which starts late Saturday night and goes on till early Sunday morning. 

 The night-long spectacle, where the Karaga, an earthen pot bedecked in flowers, will be carried by a bearer through various bylanes of the Old City. The Shaktyotsava is the high point of the 11-day festival that began on March 23.
 
 The procession, which draws hundreds of people, starts from   in Tigalarapet at 11.50 pms. It passes through the streets of Ulsoor Pete, Nagarthpet, Cubbonpet, Ganigarapete, Avenue Road, Doddapete, Aralepete, Balepete, Kumbarpete and Gollarapete before coming back to the temple where it started. 
 
 Devotees come from different parts of the state and neighbouring states as well. The entire route of the procession has been decked up for the occasion.
 
 N Manu, of the Banaswadi Periyanavaru family, will make his debut as the Karaga bearer this year. He has been trained for months at garadi manes (traditional gyms). High fitness level is a must as the bearer has to carry the jasmine-decorated Karaga pot in the shape of a tower which is quite heavy. The bearer has to walk barefoot continuosuly along the bylanes for more than five hours.
 
 Tigala community members, also known as Vahni Kula Kshatriyas, are key members of the festival. The procession is also a symbol of communal harmony, as the procession halts at the Tawakkal Mastan Saab Darga near Majestic.
