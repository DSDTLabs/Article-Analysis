 On Thursday afternoon, Sagar was playing in the farm of Bholabhai Bharvad, where his father was a farm labourer. He slipped and fell into the open borewell. Fire brigade teams from Rajkot and Ahmedabad were called in to rescue the boy.   depot manager   said, "We had inserted camera into the borewell and found that there was water there at about 70-feet. We believe that the boy had drowned."
 
 Additional chief fire officer of   (AFES), Rajesh Bhatt said, "Prima facie, it appears that the boy had drowned. But there could be multiple reasons for the death as the environment was very harsh. There was intense heat and the child was confined to a very narrow space. However, postmortem will reveal the exact cause of death."
