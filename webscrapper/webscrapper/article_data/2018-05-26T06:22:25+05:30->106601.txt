BENGALURU: Opposition leader   on Friday said the   will observe a   on Monday if the new Congress-JD(S) coalition government failed to waive farm loans.

 
 The bandh threat was Yeddyurappa’s final word as he led his party’s walk-out from the assembly during the trust vote, indicating that the BJP in its role as opposition will be combative and shrill.
 
 Picking on the JD(S) manifesto where the party had promised to waive off Rs 53,000 crore loans farmers had availed from private, co-operative and nationalised banks, Yeddyurappa said: “Since the CM and his party had made a promise to waive farmers’ loans within 24 hours of coming to power, we hold them accountable. If they do not announce the farmer loan waiver immediately, the BJP will call for a bandh on May 28.”
 
 Before Yeddyurappa’s ultimatum, CM HD Kumaraswamy had said that the government will waive loans but required some time to do so. “I am not running a government with absolute majority, but that does not mean I am going to shy away from my promise of waiving farmers’ loans.”
 
 Later, Yeddyurappa said Bengaluru has been exempted from the bandh call as there are elections in RR Nagar assembly segment on the day.
