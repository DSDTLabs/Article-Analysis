MANALI:   on   highway that usually starts on March 1 every year has been delayed due to inclement weather conditions on the hills as it is still snowing heavily.

  (BRO) spends crores of rupees on removing snow from this highway to make it motorable which takes three months for over hundred personnel and a large number of dozers, snow cutters and excavators to clear the highway. Delay in starting the work means it would open late which can affect thousands of people living across the highway and also the Indian Army that uses this highway to ferry essentials to border areas.
 
 BRO commander at 38 Border Road Task Force Colonel Arvind Awasthi who is responsible to undertake this operation said, “The annual task of clearing snow from the highway will start soon. We are in contact with DRDO’s Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment. It will be of no use if we open the highway after a lot of efforts and fresh spell of snowfall blocks it again. We are waiting for favourable weather to start the work.”
 
 Manali-Leh highway is strategically important and is lifeline for hundreds of villages. The highway was blocked after snowfall on January 6. Many portions of the highway get covered below 30 to 40ft of snow. Cutting snow and ice to search the disappeared road becomes risky. BRO jawans cut through many avalanches and landslides also. Extreme cold, blizzards, hypothermia, sliding snow and rolling boulders are major risks during the operation which has lead to loss of lives of many jawans.
 
 Clearing snow from mighty   and Baralacha pass is the main challenge. BRO has planned to start the operation in multi-stages to finish it in time. Awasthi said that the work will start on war footings to meet the target. “We know importance of the highway and have made a strategy. The terrain along the highway has received more snow in last five years. Still we shall complete the task well within time,” the officials said.
