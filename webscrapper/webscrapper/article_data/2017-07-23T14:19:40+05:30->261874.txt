 Various schemes will soon be implemented to solve water crisis in Coimbatore, the minister said. He urged people and government officials to take up lake rejuvenation work and take part in the de-silting process of lakes in the city. “We have urged the public works department to request farmers to de-silt tanks and use the silt for farming,” said Velumani.
 
 Apart from de-silting, it is important to make water enter the lake,   said. He requested the government to take up a topographical survey of all the lakes of Tamil Nadu and take necessary steps to ensure that water enters the lakes.
