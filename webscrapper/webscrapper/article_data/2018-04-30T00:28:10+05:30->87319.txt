Trichy: A team of the Rapid Action Force (RAF), which specialises in anti-riots, arrived at Thanjavur on Sunday for a familiarisation exercise to know about the districtâ€™s topography and collect vital information required to tackle communal violence or a riot-like situation, if any were to occur in the future.

 Attached to the 105 battalion based in Coimbatore, the RAF team visited various areas in the district with the help of the district police.
 
 The arrival of RAF in the city created a flutter among people on the backdrop of the on-going protest against the ONGC. Villagers have been opposing its proposed establishment of more oil wells in and around the villages in Thanjavur.
 
 At this juncture, the deployment of RAF personnel from Coimbatore created tension among the villagers in Thanjavur. However, district officials then clarified that there was no link with the arrival of the force and the on-going protest. It was merely a routine familiarisation exercise, they said.
