There are assigned trekking paths managed by village eco-development committees (EDC). After the trekkers obtain permission from the department,   members will accompany the trekkers, taking them safely in the assigned trekking routes.
 
  
 
 Apart from the pre-determined trekking routes, there are coupe routes which were once used by the department to extract timber from the forest. Eco-tourism agencies lure gullible trekking enthusiasts with attractive packaging, collecting a lot of money and drop them in some resort on the   side. From there, they are taken in these coupe routes in the name of trekking, with some companions who know terrain. The incident on Sunday is one such venture which had terrible consequences.
 
  
 
 Though timber extraction has stopped, these coupe routes are used by department for patrolling. Besides, there are numerous such routes inside the forest and closing all of them is not practical.
 
  
 
 At present there are no such norms like registering, although it is mandatory for anyone to obtain prior permission to enter forest areas including trekking expeditions.
 
  
 
 Apart from introducing monitoring these eco-tourism groups, we are also planning to sensitise the public to ensure that organisers have obtained prior permission from the forest department before taking out any adventure activities inside the forest. They will have to approach the forest department if they want to take out trekking expeditions.
