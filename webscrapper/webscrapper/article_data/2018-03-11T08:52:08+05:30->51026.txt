LUDHIANA: The   have started challaning   in the city, which had become a cause of headache for many residents, as they often obstructed traffic by stopping anywhere to pick up and drop passengers. Private bus drivers, on the other hand, complained that the police challaned only small-scale operators and not operators of big companies that had political connections. 

 One bus operator complained that the police were being partial, by using a pick-and-choose policy. A private bus driver, Baljinder Singh, said: “I was stopped in Model Town where I was picking up passengers. A Libra bus too was there, but they challaned only me, because that bus has good political connections.” “The police are challaning drivers of bus companies that are financially not very strong, and don’t have political contacts. I was challaned for having a pressure horn in my bus, but there are many other buses too who too had pressure horns, but they were not being challaned. This is really very wrong,” said Rajendra Patel, owner of a private bus. 
 
 However, people were happy to see the buses getting challaned. “These buses used to stop anywhere they wanted to, increasing the risk of accidents. They never listened to anyone. I think this is the best way to make them realize that what they were doing was wrong. They created huge problems for everyone. I’m happy to see police take action against them,” said Abhi Bansal, a resident of  .
