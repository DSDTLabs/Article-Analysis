VADODARA: Several antique pieces and silverware were stolen from the palace of Chhota Udepur’s royal family as burglars broke into the sprawling building on the night of January 26. 

 The incident left the family shocked as burglars entered the   by breaking an iron grill at the rear portion of the palace. The royal Chauhan family told police that burglars took away items of religious value and ornaments. However, they are unsure about the value of the stolen valuables. 
 
 “The family registered a complaint on Friday night. They told us that burglars broke into their residence in the intervening night of January 26 and January 27. The gang went into three rooms of the palace and flung items on the floor,” said Chhota Udepur police sub-inspector Vijaysinh Chauhan. 
 
 They then took away an antique trophy of the British era, old silver and   ornaments, a silver idol and silverware used for religious rituals. “Royal family member  , who registered the complaint, said that he didn’t know the exact value of the stolen items. They will ascertain the total value and inform us,” Chauhan told TOI. 
 
 Police investigations are focusing on finger prints at the palace and the dog squad too is being used for investigation. 
 
 Police said that the palace usually has guards by the day time but at night there is no security. 
 
 When contacted, Maharaja Aishwarya Pratapsinh Chauhan, brother of Jaypratapsinh, said that such burglary at the palace had happened about 15 years ago. “I was shocked after I heard about the burglary. I think it may be an insider job,” said Chauhan said. 
 
 The palace was built in early 20th century and has beautiful interiors complete with chandeliers and grand dining and drawing rooms.
