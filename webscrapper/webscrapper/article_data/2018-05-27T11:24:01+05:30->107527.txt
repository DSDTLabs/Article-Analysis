LUCKNOW: Inspired by the ‘fitness challenge’ of sports minister  ,   OP Singh has launched a ‘Road Safety Challenge’ campaign with a tweet urging people to upload videos and selfies of how they keep themselves and their loved ones safe on roads. The tweet also has a video showing how people come   with lame excuses for not wearing seat belts and helmets while driving.

 
 The tweet was an instant hit with more than 9,000 views of the video clip within 6 hours of the state police chief posting it.
 
 “The idea is to encourage people who abide by traffic rules and ensure their safety and that of their loved ones,” Singh told TOI. The state police chief said he had also directed the police to upload videos of how people not adhering to safety norms on road are being checked, urged to follow the norms, and fined.
 
 “This will help convince people that following traffic rules is for their safety,” he said.
