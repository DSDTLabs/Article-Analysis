CHENNAI: A couple of days ago, when   got down at the   railway station with a hand-made plough, many asked him what he was going to do with it in the city.

 Although Jolad couldn't immediately reply, the artist had a plan. With a red sketch pen, he wrote, “No farmer, No food“ on the plough. Jolad's idea was to create awareness among those who work in the corporate and IT sector about the hardships being faced by the farmers, particularly those in the south.
 
 Jolad's four-hour-long campaign began at   in Adyar. He singlehandedly made arrangements for everything, including his special attire.
 
 Even though the initial response was lukewarm, his campaign wherein he holds the plough on his head gathered momentum as he walked through the  , which houses many IT hubs in the city.
 
 “I have seen hardships that farmers face. Drought is not always the reason. If there is no farmer, then there won't be any food. So we have to support them,“ said Jolad, a Karnataka-based activist artist who had conducted solo exhibitions in Bengaluru and other cities.
 
 “My idea is to tell the young IT people to support the farmers, who are still dependent on the traditional methods of farming. It's our duty to promote farmers in our region. I am just conveying a message and it's your duty to see how you can support them,“ he said. Jolad got tremendous support from people in the city for his campaign.
 
 “When a security man asked me to move out of the entrance of an IT park, some auto rickshaw drivers came to my rescue. They put their signatures on the plough to support my cause,“ he said.
 
 Jolad has done such awareness camps in cities like Bengaluru and Ernakulam. He is planning to conduct such campaigns in some cities of Maharashtra soon.
