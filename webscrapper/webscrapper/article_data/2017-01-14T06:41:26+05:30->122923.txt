PATNA: A week after PM Narendra Modi’s and   chief minister Nitish Kumar’s show of bonhomie at a function here, JD(U) state chief Bashishtha Narain Singh, on Friday, invited senior BJP members to his residence for a ‘dahi-chura’ feast on January 15 to celebrate  .

 The two parties were NDA coalition partners, before parting ways in June 2013. This is the first time since the split that JD(U) has invited BJP members for the annual ‘dahi chura’ feast. Significantly, all the BJP members invited have agreed to join the feast. “Bashishtha Narain Singh personally telephoned me. I have had a personal relationship with him since our college days,” senior BJP member Sushil Kumar Modi told TOI.
 
 He, however, said the ‘dahichura’ feast was just a social event and no political meaning should be read into it. “I don’t recall BJP members joining our ‘dahi-chura’ feast in the last three years. But if they have accepted our invitation, it is a good sign. The feast will ease our political bitterness,” JD(U) spokesperson and MLC Neeraj Kumar told TOI.
 
 The Bihar BJP, which initially criticised the stringent liquor law of the Nitish government, softened its stand after the PM publicly praised the initiative at last week’s function to mark Guru Gobind Singh’s 350th birth anniversary.
