BHUBANESWAR: Life has held out little hope for  .   since birth, the 33-year-old resident of Bajapur in   has struggled to earn and live with dignity. Just as he was finding his feet, and preparing for a government job, life dealt him another cruel blow. 

 Trying to fend off a thief who snatched his mobile phone, Sahoo came underneath a train at Balasore station on Monday. The young man, who makes a living by singing at local programmes and private parties, lost a hand and a leg.
 
 "I had finished singing at a programme on Monday evening and was supposed to go to Cuttack. I was waiting for a train at Balasore station when someone snatched my phone. I tried to catch the person but fell on the tracks and the train ran over me," Sahoo said at KIIMS Hospital here.
 
 He was first taken to the district headquarters hospital in Balasore. When his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack. Later, he was again moved to the Bhubaneswar hospital.
 
 Sahoo, who completed his graduation in 2006, is not quite sure if he will be able to overcome the trauma. "My wife is also visually challenged. My income is not sufficient to run a family. This incident has shaken my faith. I fear, I cannot work like before," he whispered.
 
 However, help has come in from different quarters. The state government has promised to fund his treatment from the Odisha State Treatment Fund. Bhubaneswar subcollector Manas Ranjan Samal visited him on Sunday and sanctioned Rs 20,000 for him from the district Red Cross fund.
 
 The railways, meanwhile, has asked the Kharagpur divisional railway manager and the chief security commissioner of South Eastern Railway to look into the matter. The RPF at Balasore station has also submitted a report on the mishap.
