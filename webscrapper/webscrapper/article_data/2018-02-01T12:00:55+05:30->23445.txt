NASHIK: The   have booked 10 persons on charges of cheating and forgery for allegedly practising allopathy at a hospital and running the facility without the requisite registration.

 Igatpuri taluka medical officer Dr  , who lodged a police complaint, said eight of the 10 persons were electropaths, one had an ayurveda degree and one a homeopathy degree. Their illegal practice came to light when Ghoti villagers roughed up some of them on January 20 after two children had died at the hospital on the same day.
 
 
 The police, who had rushed to the hospital to maintain law and order, had seized all documents from the place. When Pawar went to the police station, he found that an old   was being used to run the hospital.
 
 “About a year back, we had cancelled the registration of a hospital in the same structure, after getting reports about the malpractice. A few months after that, the people concerned had changed the name of the hospital and started their practice again. Electropaths are not authorised to practise allopathy,” Pawar told TOI.
 
 Pawar said that an 11-yearold girl from Ghoti, who was suffering from bladder and bowel dysfunction, had died at the hospital on January 20.
 
 
 
 
 On the same day, a pregnant woman lost her child during a caesarean operation.
 
 After the child died, the woman’s relatives had rushed her to another hospital for treatment.
 
 During investigations, it was revealed that the hospital was being run using a registration certificate of the hospital that stood at the same spot earlier.
 
 Assistant inspector   of the Ghoti police station said the ten doctors, who are residents of Ghoti, Igatpuri and nearby places, are on the run.
 
 “They will be arrested soon. Additional criminal sections will be clamped on them during the course of investigations,” he said.
