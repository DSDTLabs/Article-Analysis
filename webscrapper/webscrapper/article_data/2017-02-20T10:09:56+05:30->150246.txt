SAIFAI (ETAWAH): When SP patriarch   emerged on the politics winning his first assembly polls in 1967, other political parties were almost phased out in his ancestral village Saifai. 

 After 1980 assembly elections, no rival party would hold even its stall to distribute voters slip here. Unbeaten on home turf, Mulayam lost the assembly election in Congress wave in 1980.
 
  Elderly Saifai natives recalled, Congress leader Balram Singh Yadav had showed muscle power in 1980 election when Congress workers set stall for distributing voters slip near the polling station. But after that no political party came back. Even on Sunday, SP workers could be seen sitting inside a house helping voters.
 
  
 
 
 Death of Saifai resident Shaligram about a decade back changed a unique tradition of voting in the ancestral village of Mulayam Singh Yadav. If veterans like Rajendra Singh is to be believed, before Mulayam, the village maintained a tradition of sending a Brahmin to cast his vote first to mark the beginning of voting in every election. 
 
 But Mulayam changed the tradition in 1970s and gave opportunity to a person from Jatav community to cast the vote first. And that person was Shaligram, who was always first to cast the vote till his death. Villagers said after his death the tradition ended.
