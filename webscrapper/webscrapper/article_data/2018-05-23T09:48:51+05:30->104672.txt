MUMBAI: A 2 pm start is hardly the hour when one would ask 26 players to take the field while trying to figure out whether a woman’s T20 league is possible in India. With temperatures hovering around the mid-30s and humidity levels making life extremely uncomfortable for anyone venturing out onto the streets, it was only natural that a stadium full of empty seats greeted the two teams — Trailblazers and Supernovas — when they came out for the game billed as the Women’s T20 Challenge at the Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday.

 
 The BCCI’s intentions may be noble, but the lack of proper thought into the one-off game was starkly evident as only a handful of spectators, many of them volunteers preparing for the evening’s IPL Qualifier 1 between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Chennai Super Kings, were the only people present in the stands.
 
 The lack of crowd support, though, was not going to deter the gritty women in the centre of proceedings, and all those present were treated to some spectacular catching by the Supernova outfit, who came out to field after their captain   had won the toss.
 
 Set a target of 130, Supernova made heavy-weather of the chase before scampering to a three-wicket win on the last ball of the 20th over. Opener   emerged the top scorer with 24, while her partner   contributed 22. Suzie Bates was the most successful Trailblazers bowler, claiming 2/16. Earlier, the efforts of New Zealand’s Bates (32 runs) and Indian teenager Jemimah Rodrigues (25 runs) helped Trailblazers reach a modest 129/6 in 20 overs.
