CHENNAI: The bakery in Kodungaiyur that was almost blown to smithereens following a cylinder blast was operating without a  

 According to the Tondiarpet zone corporation officials,   had opened less than a fortnight ago, adding this was too short a time for the owner to have applied for a trade license.
 
 “Earlier, he (the owner) used to sell Pani Puri from a tiny bunk shop encroaching the footpath. It (the new shop) was opened around 10-15 days ago,” said an official. Standard operating procedure says trade licenses be issued only after the business is operational, officials explained.
 
 “A proprietor has between 15-60 days after starting a business to approach us (for trade license),” said a revenue department official.
 
 According to corporation sources, this is to prevent the   from cheating. “We encounter numerous cases where the owner applies under a particular category like tea shop but is instead running a small eatery or even a restaurant,” said an official.
 
 It could not be independently verified if the gutted structure had building plan approval. As per the civic body’s website, one of the key documents to be submitted by a businessman for trade license is an NOC from the fire department.
 
 “NOC is only insisted upon for big restaurants and multi-storeyed buildings. This shop is hardly 100sqft. There is no way that the corporation would have insisted on fire safety even if the owner had applied for a license,” a source said.
 
 Zonal officials told TOI, “If business is to resume from the spot, then we will instruct the shop owner to apply for a trade license after ensuring that safety standards are met,” an official said.
 
 However, when asked as to what these safety standards would be, the officer said the corporation can ensure the shop has a decent ventilation.
