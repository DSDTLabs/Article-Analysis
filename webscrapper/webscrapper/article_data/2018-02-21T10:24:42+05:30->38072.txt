Director Madhupal's next film ' 's' first look poster, in which it's lead actor   is seen in a rustic avatar, is just out.

 On his little cycle, Tovino's 'kuprasidha payyan' takes milk from one place to the other, but is seen in a rather concerned, confused state. Tovino plays a character named Ajayan in the film and Nimisha Sajayan essays the female protagonist's role. The movie is a murder mystery and investigation.
