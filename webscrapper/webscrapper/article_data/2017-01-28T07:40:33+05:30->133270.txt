KOLKATA: History has never been the cup of tea for   and Anoushka Saha, second year students at  's international relations department. But, after listening to  's speech on Friday afternoon at the first edition of TedX organised by JU, they now want to leaf through the pages of Indian history once again.

 Though it was the day when students were eagerly awaiting the announcement of the results of the elections of JU, the turnout at Dalrymple's talk was overwhelming.  , a second-year student of international relations, said: “I had heard his earlier talks. But this was too good. Despite it being an election results day, some 700-800 students turned up.“
 
 Of course, one reason for it was the interest in the launch of Dalrymple and Anita Anand's new book 'Kohinoor: The Story of the World's Most Infamous Diamond'. “We British are pretty good at looting this country. In fact, loot was one of the very first Hindi words to have entered the English language. But we were rank amateurs in comparison to Nadir Shah,“ Dalrymple said.
 
 If Dalrymple's 18-minute-talk cleared many misconceptions about the complex history of the Kohinoor, Anand completed him with further anecdotes on the curse that's associated with the diamond. Visual slides made the talk even more interesting. Not just JU students, Dalyrmple also had listeners from   .
 
 “We took him to the university guesthouse where he had an authentic Bengali lunch with rice, daal, fish and 'doi'. While taking a stroll, he went past the ponds. Though he loved the campus, he wished the ponds were cleaner.He was curious about the hoarding explaining the functioning of internal complaints committee,“ Rushali said. Once the talk was over, the author took questions from students.
