NAGPUR: A scuffle between a patient and the Resident Medical Officer of The Employees State Insurance Scheme hospital (ESIS) that took place on Tuesday escalated to the extent that it had to be solved at Sakkardara police station. 

 The patient, 40 year-old  , working at a private enterprise in   had approached the orthopaedic department of the hospital, and was advised total hip replacement surgery.
 
 However, due to unavailability of medicines, Dr   stated that the patient would have to be operated elsewhere.   medical superintendent Dr   said, “On being told this, the patient and the person who accompanied him barged into the office of the RMO Dr Bhavna Chaudhari. “Dr   asked the patient to write an application. However, the patient started arguing. The person with the patient, a union leader from Butibori, started video shooting Dr Chaudhari. Feeling insecure, she came out of the cabin and locked the patient,” said Dr Deshmukh.
 
 Dr Chaudhari then approached the Sakkardara police station, where both sides were counselled by a police officer. “The officer said that an enquiry would take place on both sides, unless a compromise was made. Both sides then decided to resolve the issue amicably. However, we have been distressed about not being able to procure medicines on time, having to face the brunt from aggressive workers, especially those of Butibori. ESIS hospitals have been directed to purchase medicines only through Haffkine,” she said.
