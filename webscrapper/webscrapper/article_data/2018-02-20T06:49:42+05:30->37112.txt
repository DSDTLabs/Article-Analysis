BENGALURU:   and  , covering the arrest of   MLA NA Haris’ son Mohammed Nalapad Haris in a case of assault on Monday afternoon, were allegedly attacked by miscreants even as policemen in the   police station looked on.

 Md Haris and his arrested associates were being taken when TV camera crew and photojournalists tried to capture them, inviting the wrath of a gang of youths. Kartik, a reporter with a Kannada TV news channel in a police complaint alleged that policemen remained mute spectators instead of protecting the journalists.
 
 Kartik said: “They obstructed us from working and   including me, photographer   and videographer Rajesh. The miscreants chased mediapersons on the road and beat them up. Police, who were at the spot, did not take any action against them and did not do anything to save us. Some policemen even suggested we leave the spot as the attackers were rowdies.”
 
 Mediapersons managed to catch one of the attackers, and handed him over to Cubbon Park police. Chandragupta, DCP, who was in the station, came out and assured journalists of action. “We’ll register an FIR against persons attacking mediapersons and take action against them,” he said.
