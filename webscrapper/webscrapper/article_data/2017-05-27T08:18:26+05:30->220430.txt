CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Captain   on Friday announced his government’s decision to allow pillion or   as a means to generate  

 Amarinder has given in-principle approval to the initiative, which will be launched under the umbrella of ‘Apni Gaddi Apna Rozgar’ scheme as promised in the election manifesto, an official spokesperson said.
 
 It will also encourage youth to engage in entrepreneurial business, while facilitating last-mile connectivity for commuters in areas not accessible by regular four-wheeler taxis. Both Uber and Ola have shown interest in the scheme, for which the government will soon issue the necessary notification, said the spokesperson.
 
 Under the policy, currently in the finalisation stage by the transport department, existing and new motorcycle owners will be able to get commercial permits and licences to run two-wheelers as pillion taxis. Requiring minimal investment, the scheme is expected to create a major avenue for the unemployed youths to start their own businesses, the spokesperson explained.
 
 As an additional advantage, the scheme, which is already running successfully in some other states including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, West Bengal, Haryana, will also help reduce pressure of vehicular traffic on roads, besides controlling pollution.
 
 The ‘Apni Gaddi Apna Rozgar’ scheme, as proposed in the   manifesto, envisages one lakh taxis, commercial LCVs and other vehicles to be provided to unemployed youths every year at subsidized rates, without collateral and with the government standing guarantee. The government proposes to tie up with major taxi operators, such as Ola and Uber, to ensure the success of the scheme, under which the youth will be expected to repay their loan in five years.
 
 Under the ‘Harra Tractor’ scheme, at least 25,000 tractors and other agricultural implements will be given to unemployed youth at subsidized rates to enable them to start their own   ventures.
