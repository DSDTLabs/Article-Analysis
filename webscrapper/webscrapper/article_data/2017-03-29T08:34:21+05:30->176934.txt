PUNE: In a few months, as   makes his way to meet 30 Nobel laureates in Lindau, Germany, people from his hometown in Jharkhand will have to hold on to their questions on school science projects. He may be pursuing an integrated PhD, but to folks back home he is still the first point of reference for anything science-related. 

 Swarnkar is the only student from Pune who has been selected to meet the Nobel laureates during the 67th annual meeting to be held between June 25 and 30. He hails from Dhanbad and joined the   (IISER) in 2012. Swarnkar also holds the distinction of getting his paper on solar cells published in the journal Science in 2016.
 
 Swarnkar shared that his family understands little of the research he does but they know he is a scientist and that explains the calls from his village. 
 
 He recalled, "I cleared IISER after my graduating in Science and soon started working for   (BASE) Fellowship Program. I was sent to the   in America. In October last year, my paper was selected to be published in the weekly journal Science from among 10,000 research students from across the country."
 
 "My aim is to make a product that will be used by the masses," added Swarnkar.
 
 The researcher is among 400 young scientists from around the globe, who have been offered the opportunity to experience the scientific ambience of the Lindau Nobel laureate Meetings. From India, Swarnkar will accompany 22 students and young researchers selected by the Department of Science and Technology.
