MUMBAI: A   from   tried to commit suicide by immolating himself outside the   main gate on Wednesday. 

 Around 1.30pm, security men at the main gate spotted Ganesh Pawar (30) from Rahuri in Ahmednagar pouring kerosene on himself and stopped him just as he was to set himself on fire. The police said Pawar wanted an audience with the chief minister to demand the arrest of  , chief of the right-wing group Shivpratishthan Hindustan who has been accused of instigating the   in January. The state has already given a clean chit to Bhide as police probe found that he was not in the area at the time of the incident.
 
 Marine Drive senior police inspector Vilas Gangavne said they have detained Pawar. “He took the extreme step after he made the demand to take action against Bhide who he claimed was the perpetrator in the Koregaon Bhima matter,” said Gangavne. According to sources, Pawar is a member of Republican Sena, a Dalit organization.
