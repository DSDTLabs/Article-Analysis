Panaji: A special court on Tuesday granted the special investigation team ( ) additional time to file its reply against former chief minister Digambar  , in connection with anticipatory bail sought by him in the illegal mining case. The matter will now be heard on May 12.

 Kamat, who approached courts after he was summoned by SIT, was subsequently granted interim anticipatory bail on a surety of Rs 1 lakh, and the hearing was fixed for May 2. However, when the matter came up for hearing on Tuesday morning, SIT sought time to file its reply.
 
 The former chief minister and incumbent Margao MLA was recently issued summons for a second time in connection with the illegal mining scam. He was first questioned by SIT in February 2014. Fomer director of the stateâ€™s mines and geology department, Arvind Lolienkar, who had also been summoned along with Kamat, was arrested by SIT in March that same year. He is presently out on bail.
 
 The Congress-led government, headed by Kamat from 2007 to 2012, had been indicted by the Shah Commission in the Rs 35,000 crore mining scam. The commission was headed by Justice P B Shah.
 
 After taking over power in March 2012, the BJP-led government, had appointed a SIT to probe the scam, but failed to make much progress.
