BHOPAL: Migration for jobs is a common phenomenon in drought-hit   district. The situation is so bad that leave alone common people, even elected representatives are forced to desert the place in search of employment opportunities. No wonder, a dalit up-sarpanch   had to migrate to Delhi for job as she had no other option but to leave her native place. The last time she visited her   village was in February to get her toilet constructed.

 The village   told TOI on Tuesday, “   was in Khadgawan village till March. She will be back again for a marriage in her family in Khadgawan soon.”
 
 Before leaving to Delhi in March, Manju had told about her plight to the local media. “Officials would have cancelled our ration cards in case the toilet was not constructed. I may be an up -sarpanch, but I need money to run my family. Panchayats are battling drought conditions and are helpless in supporting people who are facing drinking water problem. My family owns 3.5 hectares of land, but there is no water. Migration is the only way out to survive. Moreover, I am under debt of Rs 3 lakh”, she had said.
 
 Village sarpanch told TOI, “There is no water and the officials do not understand the problem of villagers. I have written many times to engineers of public health engineering department and also to district administration, but in vain.”
