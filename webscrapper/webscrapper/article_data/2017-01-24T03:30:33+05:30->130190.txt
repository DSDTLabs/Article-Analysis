   villagers have alleged that an area of  , lying in a   (NDZ) along  , is being reclaimed for the mini India park, a project that has been issued provisional approval by the   (IPB).
 
  Truckloads of mud are being dumped at the site since the last few days, this despite the matter being challenged before the high court of Bombay at Goa by Goa Foundation on the issue of violation of   (CRZ) notification of 1991.
  
  “A large area had already been reclaimed over the years illegally,” local activist   said. He has filed several complaints before authorities. The latest one was filed before the chief secretary, who referred it to the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA).
  
  Xavier has, however, alleged that despite reminders, authorities have failed to stop mud filling. The court has issued a notice to the government and the project promoter, who has to obtain other approvals after issuance of provisional permission from IPB.
  
  But, Xavier alleged that the mud-filling continues illegally. When he contacted the GCZMA on Monday, as the chief secretary’s directive was not being complied with, he was assured that necessary action would be taken soon.
