KOCHI: Bureau of civil aviation securities (BCAS) has imposed strict regulations on air passengers carrying of power banks as it can be easily modified to transport explosive material.

 According to the new guidelines, power banks cannot be carried in check-in bags and luggage, but only on hand-baggage carried by passengers. However, locally manufactured power banks - made by unrecognized companies or brands - cannot be carried in either check-in luggage or hand baggage.
 
 BCAS released the new guidelines after a locally manufactured power bank, which was manipulated, was seized by security officials at   airport.
 
 A   international airport statement said the security personnel at many airports across the country have often found locally manufactured low-quality power banks being manipulated for illegally transporting explosive materials or contraband goods by replacing the cells inside the power bank. "As known-brands are less prone to being manipulated or restructured for being fitted with explosive materials, these can be carried by passengers in their hand luggage. However, even branded power banks won't be allowed to be transported in check-in luggage," the statement said.
 
 Locally manufactured power banks are sometimes fitted with duplicate batteries made of clay beside the original batteries so as to give an impression of larger battery capacity. Such power banks are easy to open, which are used to alter the device into improvised explosive devices.
 
 Power banks which are packed inside the check-in luggage will be detained by the security officials, and the holder of the luggage will be summoned for further checking, the statement said. A passenger whose luggage had a secret rack with a power bank in it was recently detained at Cochin airport.
 
 According to the new guidelines, power banks cannot be sent as courier or cargo either.
