NEW DELHI: The number of steps being taken by the Centre will change the perception of   towards government in the next few months, Union minister and   (LJP) chief   claimed on Friday. He added that the government has decided that there will be no change "at any cost" in the existing SC/ST (Prevention) of Atrocities Act.

 
 "We hope the Supreme Court will consider the sentiments of the poor and Dalits, and will also consider that the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was made for a special purpose as per constitutional provision. This should not be compared with any other general law and it supersedes the Criminal Procedure Code, which has provision for anticipatory bail," the minister said.
 
 Paswan also said the government has all options open including the promulgation of ordinance, if it is required.
 
 Dalit groups have been protesting the Supreme Court order, which has allowed provision for anticipatory bail and introduced safeguards for accused in case of fraudulent complaints. TOI on Friday had reported that a group of ministers headed by home minister   had decided that the law should be reinstated in its entirety.
 
 Paswan said he was hopeful that the government will take necessary steps to ensure there is reservation in promotion. "What moral right does the opposition, including Mayawati, have to ask questions to government? Mayawati's government issued administrative order to dilute the SC/ ST law in 2007. A parliamentary panel with members from all opposition parties had recommended similar relaxations in 2014-15," he added.
