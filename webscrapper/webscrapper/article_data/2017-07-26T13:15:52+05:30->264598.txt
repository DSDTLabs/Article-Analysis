SHIMLA: The   government on Tuesday offered Sushma Verma, wicketkeeper of Indian women’s cricket team that reached the Women’s World Cup final, the DSP’s position in state police.

 Verma belongs to Himri panchayat of Shimla rural constituency. Although her family is happy with the offer, her response is awaited. Verma is the first cricketer from Himachal Pradesh to represent India.
 
 Chief minister   said Verma has been offered the post as she brought laurels to the state.
 
 Born on November 3, 1992 at Gaderi village, about 100 kms from Shimla, she was fond of sports since childhood. Despite limited resources available in the village, she pursued her dream facing all odds. She was selected through a trial for the residential cricket academy of   in Dharamshala in 2009. She was selected for Indian women’s cricket team during England tour in 2014.
 
 Owing to fewer opportunities in the domestic circuit, she started playing for the Railways. She played along with Mithali Raj, Harmanpreet Kaur and Punam Raut. In June this year, the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association had named the pavilion at   stadium after Verma.
