LUDHIANA: Following the expose of an alleged sting involving   leader and accused in 1984 anti-Sikh riots Jagdish Tytler, the 1984 Sikh Katle Aam Peedit Welfare Society in Ludhiana demanded his arrest.

 Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, state president of society   and president of women’s wing Surjeet Kaur said, “After the sting surfaced, it is very clear that Tytler had acted on the orders of former Prime Minister   and orchestrated the killings of thousands of innocent Sikhs in 1984.”
 
 They said, “Everyone knew about his involvement in this manslaughter, but now he himself has admitted to it. So whether it’s the   or court, they should take notice of his self-admission and should be immediately arrested and hanged so that justice is served to the families of victims who were butchered. Even after 33 years, the families of victims are forced to live in fear and trauma and perpetrators of this heinous act are still roaming free.”
 
 The leaders also said it’s time that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister   fulfill the promise to give justice to the victims of 1984 riots.
 
 Paramjit Singh Khalsa, president of Sikh Student Federation, was present in the meeting. Members of the society and some of the riot-affected families also staged a protest.
