KOLHAPUR: Auto rickshaw and taxi union drivers have decided to go on one-day   midnight till 5pm on Tuesday. They claim an unprecedented fee hike on various vehicles by the Central government on January 6.

 In the last fortnight, vehicle organisations across the district have raised their voices against the fees hike. After the Centre did not roll back the rise in fee hike, the auto and taxi unions in the city have decided to take the protest at the next level. As many as ten auto and ten taxi unions have decided to take part in the strike.
 
 District president of Vahatuk Sena (a transportation wing of  ),  , said, “All rickshaw and taxi unions in Maharashtra have decided to go on a strike from Monday midnight to 5pm on Tuesday. The government has hiked various vehicles fees such as licence fees and endorsing of lease purchase agreement.”
 
 He added, “Moreover, even after the transfer of ownership fee has been raised, the auto driver’s business remains vulnerable due to restrictions imposed on them. The raise in hike will further cripple their business. Auto business has given employment to a large sector of unemployed youths in the late sixties. Thousands of men earn their living through their auto business. To ensure that they do not fall out of their business, we have decided to observe a strike on Tuesday.”
 
 Member of  , Rajendra Jadhav, said, “We have been protesting against the fee hike for the past two weeks now. Since no action has been taken to improve our situation, we have decided to go for a strike now. We have already demanded the transport office to revoke the hike in fees at the earliest. We would intensify our protest if the Centre continues to ignore our demands.”
