As per laws, if the hospital concerned does not give an answer, we can file a case against it in the CJM's court."
 
 Pandey said every hospital should have at least ten basic firefighting measures: Proper exit routes, smoke sensors, fire-extinguishers, hose reels, hydrant points, hose pipes, sprinkler system, smoke extraction, emergency light in lobbies and other emergency exits and an expert to operate and run this system.
 
 None of these measures is active in any of the government hospitals in the city, said Pandey.
 
 He said hospitals must appoint a technical expert for maintenance of fire equipment, its function and also conduct mock drills in order to be better prepared in case of an accident.
 
 In 2016, a high-powered committee comprising director (fire services), deputy director (fire services), joint director (fire services), chief fire officer and fire station officer had issued an advisory to all the 13 government hospitals in the city to take fire-fighting measures.
 
 However, senior fire officials said 12 of the government hospitals failed to respond. Veerangana Jhalkhari Bai was the only hospital that stated that it lacked the funds to install a fire-fighting system.
