CHANDIGARH: Passenger traffic from the newly   grew 20% in 2016-17 over the previous year. Around 18.35 lakh flyers used the facility despite its infrastructural short comings. In 2015-16, 15.33 lakh travellers used the airport.

 “Ours can become the most profitable and fastest growing airport in the country,” Suneel Dutt, chief executive officer,  , said. 
 
 The spike in passengers came despite time restrictions imposed by the IAF. Civilian aircraft can’t operate from Chandigarh airport after 8 pm. Also, the airport had to close down operations for brief periods because of routine runway maintenance. 
 
 The 20% rise in passenger traffic is encouraging, aviation industry experts say. As of now, more than 50 flights touch down in Chandigarh every day, connecting Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Jaipur, Pune, Leh, Jammu and Srinagar. 
 
 The airport has capacity for more flights. Two services to Dubai and Sharjah operate from the international airport that started operations from October 2015. 
 
 The Chandigarh International Airport Ltd (CHIAL) bagged the Customer Satisfaction Survey Award for 2016. Airports Authority of India (AAI) data show that in 2006-07, some 1.5 lakh passengers used the airport. Similarly the facility handled 15,437 flights in 2016-17 against 4,094 in 2006-07. 
 
 “Remember Chandigarh serves as the gateway to those visiting the Tricity, parts Haryana, Uttrakhand and most of Himachal,” Dutt said. “But because of time restrictions, some airlines aren’t launching new flights here. Once these operational issues are sorted out, this airport is set to witness exponential growth,” he added.
