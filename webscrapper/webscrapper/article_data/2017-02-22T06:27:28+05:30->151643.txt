CHENNAI: Nearly four years after   youth   was found dead on the railway tracks in   district after being separated from his girlfriend, triggering prolonged caste unrest in the state’s northern districts, the   has concluded that it was a case of suicide.

 Accepting the report filed by the premier investigating agency on Tuesday, a   bench of acting chief justice Huluvadi G Ramesh and justice R Mahadevan closed the case, bringing to an end one of the most widely-debated deaths in recent times.
 
 Ilavarasan’s body was found on the railway tracks on July 4, 2013, days after a habeas corpus proceedings involving him and the girl, belonging to another caste, saw a bitter end with the girl choosing to go with her mother. Dalit activists moved the high court demanding fresh postmortem, judicial inquiry and a CBI probe into the death. After a fresh autopsy, the high court handed over the case to the CB-CID.
 
 Earlier, Dharmapuri district superintendent of police Asra Garg had filed a report, backed with evidence, holding that it was a case of suicide and not caste murder as alleged by others.
 
 On Tuesday, the CB-CID filed a similar report, saying Ilavarasan’s body had traces of alcohol and that inquiries with about 65 witnesses confirmed that he was under severe depression after his girlfriend chose to go with her mother. Her father had committed suicide after the girl eloped with Ilavarasan. His death sparked a caste row in most of the northern districts, resulting in consolidation of a certain caste and polarization of society on caste lines.
 
 Accepting the CB-CID report, the bench cited the clear postmortem reports backed by other evidence gathered by the investigating agency and closed the case saying it did not require any further orders.
