CHENNAI: In an apparent reference to the AIADMK whose workers regularly prostrated before former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, DMK working president M K   has urged members of his party not to fall at his feet.

 The DMK desired that all people are at the same level, he said in a letter to party workers on Saturday.
 
 Stalin said many partymen had been meeting him after he took over as working president. Some of them fell at his feet and others waiting in the queue to greet him also tended to follow suit. Tamils should not fall at anyone's feet except their parents, said Stalin.
 
 “I am happy to meet all cadres and I know you have love for me. But at times a cadre or party leader falls at my feet. I prevent them and even scold them. Ours is a self-respect party,“ said Stalin. “It was only our thalaivar (DMK president  ) who changed the hand-rickshaw in Chennai and other districts to cyclerickshaw so that it would be easy for the rickshaw pullers and [ensure] they have a better life. Similarly, it was only when he was chief minister, that he constructed   so that people from various castes can live in the same apartment or area,“ said Stalin. This shows our party respects all people with self respect, he said.
 
 “Vanakkam is enough for me as I consider myself one among you. I also don't want cadres to bow before me,“ said Stalin.
 
 Asking the workers to work hard to remain in good shape, Stalin said “We need our feet to work for our party and it is better to use it for that purpose. It is also because people had bowed low in the recent past that our state is in such a bad situation.“
