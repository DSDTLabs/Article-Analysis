VADODARA: Former Baroda Ranji coach, Jacob  , who was recently removed from his job, and members of the Cricket   (CHS) met charity commissioner on Friday and sought action against the   (BCA) management alleging that the body is flouting Lodha committee’s recommendations. 

 “If the charity commissioner doesn’t pass relevant orders or BCA doesn’t act on the Lodha committee’s reforms, we will file petition in the   and seek its intervention,” Martin who has joined CHS – a rival group that has been fighting with BCA management over several issues. 
 
 “The Lodha committee’s recommendations are clear except for a couple of issues that the BCCI is contesting. BCA should implement the other recommendations,” he added. 
 
 “There are a number of eligible candidates including myself are ready to to serve the BCA but due to present set up of vested interests we have been deliberately kept out of contention,” Martin said in his letter. He has also submitted a list of 16 BCA committee members who are disqualified from holding any posts according to Lodha committee’s recommendations. 
 
 BCA secretary (in-charge),   said, “We are following the guidelines issued by the BCCI and the Supreme Court. Once the BCCI is clear about all the issues will also implement its order.”
