From discussions on India 2020 – the late APJ Abdul Kalam’s vision for the country – and India’s space programmes to the person he was, guests were busy discussing the former president at a recent event in the capital. The get-together was hosted by SM Khan, DG, Registrar of Newspapers for India (RNI), at Vice President Hamid Ansari’s residence.

 
 In his address, Finance Minister   told guests about his association with Kalam, and said, “We used to go jogging to Panchsheel Park. After he was nominated for president, I used to visit him to discuss politics and administration, but instead, he used to discuss oceans and space. His questions and knowledge used to make me think that I know very little. He used to be least interested in what I wanted to tell him. I remember, once, we organised his meeting with SRCC students, and after the interaction, when we were leaving, he said, ‘I will just come, I forgot something.’ He forgot to get a picture clicked with the group.”

 Many from the I&B Ministry were also present on the occasion. Khan, who hosted the evening, told us, “I was very close to Dr Kalam during the five years of his presidency as well as subsequently. He was the first president to return a bill to Parliament for reconsidering under Article 111 of the Constitution (referring to the Office of Profit Bill). He could have sat over it and allowed it to lapse. He didn’t want a confrontation, but at the same time, he wanted to make his point clear. He used to tell us, ‘I will do whatever I am required to do’.”
 Khan, who has penned The People’s President: Dr  , said, “On August 15, 2015, during the ‘At Home’ ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan, I met Prime Minister Modi and he prompted me to write something on Dr Kalam.”
