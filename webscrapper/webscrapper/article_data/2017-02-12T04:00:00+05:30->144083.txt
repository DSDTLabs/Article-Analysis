Vadodara: M S University’s Polytechnic College has become the nodal centre for ‘Virtual Labs’.  Virtual Lab is an initiative of the Ministry of Human Resource Development under the National Mission on Education through ICT conducted by IIT Mumbai. Associate professor Nitin Bhate from Faculty of Technology and Engineering has been appointed as regional coordinator for Gujarat and Sheetal Shinkhede from Polytechnic College’s Department of Electrical Engineering is nodal coordinator.  Any institute from Gujarat can contact them for availing any facilities of this newly set up virtual lab which will cater to the needs of students from science and engineering at school, diploma, undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD level by providing remote access to laboratories in various disciplines.  “It has become difficult for any single entity to understand the rapidly changing dynamics of science and engineering. By having virtual lab, the costly resources and equipment, which are otherwise available to limited places, can be shared remotely,” said Shinkhede, adding that the lab will compliment the prevailing teaching methodology.  “Students can learn basic and advanced concepts of science and engineering and can have additional facilities of web resources, video lectures among others through the virtual lab which are also recommended for skill development programmes,” she said.  “Additionally, while teachers can access this virtual lab in their classrooms, students too can access them from their home,” she said, adding that students can practice what they have learnt through this virtual lab.
