Ace cinematographer   and director   are all set to team up again, for the sixth time to be exact. The duo will come together Mani Ratnam’s next home production and directorial. The buzz is that Mani Ratnam is likely to rope in his Kaatru Veliyidai star   for the film. However, there is no confirmation on the star cast. Rahman is expected to score the music.

 Santhosh Sivan and Mani Ratnam had earlier worked together in Thalapathy, Roja, Iruvar, Uyire, and Raavanan. The duo is likely to begin the work on the project, once Santhosh Sivan wraps up AR Murugadoss’s   starring Mahesh Babu and Rakul Preet Singh.
