BHOPAL: The general administration department of Madhya Pradesh has issued a circular dated August 22 that has resulted in a panic amongst government employees.

 The circular (C-3/24/2000/3/1) has been sent to all district collectors and department heads instructing a performance appraisal of all class III and class IV state government employees who have completed 20 years of service or attained the age of 50 years.
 
 Instructions have been given to mandatorily review the service record documents of all class III and IV employees by a district level scrutiny committee. If the performance of any such employee who has completed 20 years in service or has reached 50 years, is found unsatisfactory then government will act under an already present administrative provision by which the employee can be given compulsory retirement.
 
 Many district collectors have ordered submission of performance details of government employees in a prescribed format. The same appraisal form with details will be presented for scrutiny before the scrutinising committees at the districts.
 
 Sudhir Nayak of the   told TOI that provision for compulsory retirement of a non-performing employee existed for long. But it was last implemented in 1995-96 by the then   Congress government.
 
 “Three employees had lost their jobs,” Nayak recalled. He said that neither former chief minister Digvijaya Singh in his second term or the present BJP government in its 14 years of rule called for such a scrutiny. The question is why the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government is implementing this rule one year before the next assembly elections.
 
 Speaking to reporters, minister for revenue   said, “Performance appraisal is necessary. It needs to be done if we want efficiency in state government offices." Minister of state Vishwas Sarang said, “Performance scrutiny is required. It strengthens government working.”
