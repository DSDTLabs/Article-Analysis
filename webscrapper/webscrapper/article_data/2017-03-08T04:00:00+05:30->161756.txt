Vadodara: The sessions court on Wednesday rejected the bail application of Kiran Rathod alias Khanna, who was arrested on February 20 for kidnapping and raping a minor girl in Sokhda.

 The girl’s father had registered a complaint against Rathod after he returned to the village with the girl on February 19. He had alleged that Rathod had taken her daughter to Kutch on January 15 after promising to marry her.
 
 District government pleader Manoj Darji opposed Rathod’s bail on the grounds that he had kidnapped a minor girl and had raped her for over a month at Mandvi in Kutch. 
 
 After hearing the arguments, additional district and sessions judge R K Chudawala rejected his bail application. TNN
