NEW DELHI: One person was killed and at least 15 people were reported wounded, many with life-threatening injuries, after two shooters opened fire in a Cincinnati,  , nightclub in the wee hours local time on Sunday, reported WLWT5, a local TV station and the   Police Department.

 “It's a chaotic crime scene. We are in the middle of a very horrific situation that occurred at the nightclub with multiple victims,” said Cincinnati assistant police chief Paul Neudigate said. “It’s going to be a long night for our homicide units to investigate.” he added.
 
 Cincinnati police have confirmed that it is a homicide investigation but didn't say if anyone was in custody. Victims have been rushed from the Cameo Club on the east side of the city to local hospitals and fire stations, police added. Some reports said the gunman is still on the loose.
 
 
 
  
 Neudigate said this shooting was one of the largest shooting cases that he has worked in his 20 plus years with the department. However, witnesses are in short supply, he added .
 
 “Many of them fled, unfortunately. Many of the witnesses fled, but everyone that we can identify is being interviewed,” said.

 This incident has occurred a little under a year after a deadly shooting in a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, when a terrorist killed 49 people and wounded 53 others. It was the deadliest mass shooting by a single shooter, the deadliest incident of violence against the Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-Trans community in US history and the deadliest terrorist attack in the US since September 11, 2001.
