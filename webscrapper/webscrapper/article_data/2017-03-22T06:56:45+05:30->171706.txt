BENGALURU: The  , to be presented on Saturday, is likely to be 40% larger than last year. But Bengalureans need not nurse any hope that the bounty would make a difference to their lives, as the civic body’s actual spend is near certain to be far less than the allocation.

 The BBMP’s 2016-17 budget size was around Rs 9,300 crore, but the actual spend was only 60% of the sum, at Rs 5,631 crore. This year, the budget size is expected to cross Rs 13,000 crore. The actual spend of the BBMP has been less than half of the budgetary size in four of the last five years.
 
 The 2016-17 budget promised Bengalureans the moon, and spoke of Wi-Fi in bus stations and commercial hubs, dialysis units in every assembly segment, CCTV surveillance in schools and colleges to keep girl students safe under the Kangavalu scheme, and planting of 2 lakh saplings in every ward. Though the financial year will end in a week, none of these schemes have seen the light of day.
 
 Civic experts say the BBMP has a habit of presenting budgets that don’t match its revenue generation capacity. “This is why most budget schemes remain on paper. The revenue generation target for 2016-17 was Rs 8,991 crore, but what the civic body has got so far is Rs 4,206 crore. Most of the revenue generated goes towards clearance of pending bills to contractors. Even now, Rs 1,218 crore worth of contractors’ bills are awaiting BBMP clearance,” said urban expert ASK Pani.
 
 Given its poor revenue generation record, the BBMP inevitably has to depend on state government grants to fulfil its budget promises. However, here too it faces a problem. “The grants announced by the state government to the BBMP in 2016-17 came to Rs 5,500 crore but it’s got only Rs 1,235 crore so far. We also have to service various loans that total up to Rs 1,680 crore, and the annual payment towards this is Rs 170 crore,” said city mayor G Padmavathi.
 
 Another civic expert said, on condition of anonymity, that politics around the BBMP budget where parties announce too many welfare schemes to woo voters is another worry. “The lack of scientific planning results in funds getting allocated in bits and pieces everywhere. Even for 2016-17, not even 50% of the Rs 752 crore kept aside for welfare schemes has been utilized. This is why we see no change in our lives, even as budgets go on every year. Also, the bigger the budget, the poorer the implementation,” he explained. 
 
 MK Gunashekar, chairman, Standing Committee for Taxation and Finance, BBMP, who will be presenting the new budget, said he is taking all measures to ensure that previous mistakes are not repeated. “With GIS mapping of properties and other revenue generation measures, we hope to garner more funds for our projects and schemes in 2017-18,” he claimed.
 
 MORE POWERS, MORE TRANSPARENCY
 
 The BBMP has done well to improve property tax collection and introduce transparency in its expenditure in the past two years. While much is left to be done by the BBMP, the baton is now with the state government. The BBMP needs powers over more revenue like stamp duty, professional tax, entertainment tax, share of GST etc. Simultaneously, the BBMP also needs to be brought under the Karnataka Municipal Accounting and Budgeting Rules 2006, that require high levels of accountability and are already applicable to all other municipalities in Karnataka. Both these reforms can only be done by the government. Instead of initiating these reforms, the government is budgeting for BBMP’s works in the state budget. No one benefits from BBMP’s unrealistic budgets year on year without these basic reforms being undertaken.
