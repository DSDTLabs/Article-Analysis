HYDERABAD: In a bizarre incident late on Sunday night, an entire bus shelter went missing from   road that leads towards   in Old City.

 Shocked commuters who arrived as usual at the stop on Monday morning, discovered that shelter was gone, down to the last metal. The bus stop is exactly opposite the   (DLRL). Only the sawed down ends of the metal pillars that had held up the structure remained.
 
 While many commuters were heard saying the bus shelter was stolen by miscreants, residents of the area suspect it could be the work of the plot owners nearby.
 
 The incident came to light after a few social activists, residing in the area took to Twitter and later submitted a written application of the complaint to the   ( ) officials and the police.
 
 Through his Twitter handle, @shkmohammed1, a social activist and resident of Chandrayangutta, Shaik Mohammad tweeted, “Missing bus stop shelter at Chandrayangutta opposite DLRL main gate. It’s a crucial and public issue, please take necessary action to safeguard the public property”.
 
 Another commuter, Mohammad Saber said, “The bus shelter was here from past six to seven years. The beams of the shelter were cut off with no sign of even a tiny fragment of the dismantled remains. This is really shocking”.
 
 When contacted, Y Prakash Reddy, Inspector, Chandrayangutta said, “A few people who reside in the area have submitted an application to the GHMC asking to remove the bus shelter from the area but the shelter went missing before they got any approval from GHMC”.
 
 He further informed that they are on the lookout for the miscreants and registered the case under Section 427 of Indian Penal Code.
 
 However, the question of how a huge bus shelter walked away in plain sight was of course the one that no-one had answer for.
