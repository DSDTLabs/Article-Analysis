BENGALURU: The   jail on the outskirts of Bengaluru city is yet again in the news with AIADMK general secretary  ,   and Ilavarasi set to serve their sentence here after the Supreme Court restored a trial court order convicting them in an illegal assets case.

 Karnataka police have deployed a platoon of   near the jail, and security has been beefed up along Hosur Road between Parappana Agrahara and Attibele toll gate.
 
 Sasikala has been asked to surrender before the special court. The special court was set up in the jail and provided the security cover required for late chief minister  , the main accused.
 
 The court heard the case on the prison premises, which were being cleaned on Tuesday. It is not clear whether surrender will happen in the prison. Karnataka police, however, expect a charged atmosphere near the prison, given its proximity to the Tamil Nadu border. “The Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border is considered a sensitive area. Although we don't expect any tension this time, we don't want to take any chances,“ said a senior police officer.
 
 This is the second time that Sasikala is being imprisoned in Parappana Agrahara jail. She spent 21 days here in 2014 when she was convicted by the trial court along with Jayalalithaa. They were sent to jail on September 27, 2014 and were released on bail on October 28, 2014. Sasikala was given the cell no. 7402, while the former chief minister had 7401.
 
 The jail authorities said Sasikala would have no privileges, unlike Jayalalithaa, and she would be treated like any other convict.
 
 “No special arrangements are being made for Sasikala.She will be kept in a cell like any other inmate of the jail,“ said Krishna Kumar, superintendent of Parappana Agrahara jail. Sources said the jail authorities had put some prisoners on the job of cleaning up the court hall in the prison campus.
