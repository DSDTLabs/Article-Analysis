PUNE: A group of 14 boys assaulted a junior college teacher on Thursday evening in   because he stopped them from removing his scooter from the institution’s ground so that they could play cricket. They also beat up two peons for intervening in the matter.

 
 The boys — aged between 14 and 17 years — attacked the teacher with a knife, iron rod and cricket bat around 6pm. Two boys were detained at night and their 12 accomplices were booked for rioting and assaulting the teacher as well as the two peons.
 
 The Yerawada police said the teacher and the peons were attacked on the premises of Dr   but none of the boys studied at the institution. They just came to play on the college ground.
 
 The assaulted teacher,   (21), of Dhanori lodged a complaint with the police later in the night. According to his complaint, he spotted two boys pushing his scooter parked near the ground. He went to the ground and told them not to touch his two-wheeler. This enraged the boys.
 
 Within minutes, about a dozen boys gathered near Bansode. Without any warning, they hit him on the head with a knife.
 
 
 
 One of the boys assaulted the teacher with an iron rod, while another hit him on the shoulder with a cricket bat. When   fell on the ground, he was kicked and punched.
 
 The two college peons —   and K Avasare — saw the teacher being assaulted and tried to pacify the boys. But the latter assaulted both the peons also.
 
 The police said some employees of the college rushed the teacher and the two peons to a private hospital. Their injuries were not critical, though. The hospital alerted the police about the incident.
 
 The college authorities knew the boys because they regularly played cricket at the ground. Their identities were disclosed to the police and two of them were detained later in the night.
