 Chandigarh: Following a TOI report on broken dividers and roundabouts, the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation (MC) has started installing new blinkers on all the sides of roundabouts across the city. The move would make these dividers and roundabouts more visible to the late night commuters.
 
 After it was witnessed that almost half a dozen roundabouts and dividers across the city were damaged after being hit by various vehicles, SP Chandigarh Traffic Police Shashank Anand asked the MC officials to install new blinkers and reflective tape on them.
 
 The MC officials, however, said that the repair works are done wherever necessary.
 
 "We repair broken boundaries of roundbabouts and dividers wherever there is an existing damage. We continue doing this all through the week, after identifying a problem at different points," said chief engineer of MC Manoj Bansal.
 
 “The installed blinkers at times fall off after the impact of a collision. Hence, we continue to restoring them," he added.
 
 Meanwhile, to provide better visibility at night, the department has also replaced old street lights at various places with new 200 watt LED lights.
 
 "At various roundabouts like Sector 7-26, Madhya Marg new LED lights have been installed to provide better visibility at night. Along with this, we would be re-taping the dividers with reflective tapes to prevent the any possibility of accidents,” another official added.
