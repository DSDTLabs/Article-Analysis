RANCHI: Within a month of alleged starvation death in Garhwa, another life has been reportedly claimed by hunger. 

 While family members have alleged that  , 67, of   village under Majhiaon block of Garhwa district died on December 25 due to hunger as the family was denied its grain entitlement under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) for the past three months, the district administration has rejected the charge and said the victim died of old age.
 
 A team of Right to Food campaign (RTF) activists in Ranchi has found lacuna in the Public Distribution System and functioning of the local Customer Service Point.
 
 RTF activist Mithilesh Jahur and Siraj met family members, their neighbours, PDS dealer Chandradev Sharma and CSP in-charge Anil Choudhary and recorded their statements. Based on the statement of the family members and neighbours, it was found that no dinner was cooked on December 24.
 
 The team found that Etwaria Devi, a widow, lived with her son  , daughter in-law   and three grandchildren. The family was entitled to 25kg grains every month under the Priority Household Card (ration card number 202000051498) under the NFSA. Usha Devi used to collect ration on behalf of the family.
 
 "They did not get ration in October, November and December till the death of Etwaria Devi. In October, Usha Devi's fingerprint did not work in the POS machine. In November, the dealer said he had not been allotted grain for that month and in December, the dealer said the POS machine was not working and had to be repaired. In the last three months, the shortage of food cost the family dearly," Siraj said.
