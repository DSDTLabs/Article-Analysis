He was briefing reporters on the deliberations of the council meeting here on Saturday. “The reforms brought in the labour sector are for the benefits of the capitalists and they are meant to ease the process of doing business,” he said.

 Sen said though the government had claimed that the job opportunities had increased under the NDA rule, the fact was that it had shown a negative trend in the last four years. “It is visible in the all of the eight labour-intensive sectors,” he said.
 
 
 Asked whether the unity of all sections shown among the working class be replicated in the political arena too, Sen said there were some problems in politics.
 
 Elamaram Kareem, who was also present at the briefing, denied that the LDF government has branded those who are engaged in agitations as extremists. “There is a difference between the agitation by the working class and the strike against development,” he said.
 
 The council meeting adopted a resolution asking the   to review the recent judgment on Prevention of Atrocities (SCST) Act. “The judgment ignored the social reality and caste oppression, harassment and atrocities against dalits,” the resolution said.
