MUMBAI: A sessions court recently rejected the bail plea of a software engineer arrested for the online leak of the fourth episode of seventh season of popular fantasy series `Game of Thrones'.
Rejecting the bail plea of the accused Abhishek   (26), the court said that there was no doubt he had a user ID and password and records showed that he accessed the disputed file (leaked episode) the same time as the co-accused  . Further it said that it is also seen that the link was also sent to the other accused and it was spread all over the internet.
 
 “New inventions in internet activities are being developed daily . Therefore, investigation of such offences is a difficult task before the investigating agency . Since the investigation is still at an initial stage if the applicant is released on bail the accused being a software test engineer, the possibility of tampering with evidence cannot be ruled out,“ the court said.
 
 The accused and three others were arrested on August 14. Ghildiyal,   and Alok Sharma were employees of the complai nant, Prime Focus Technologies, a media-processing company tasked with storing and distributing digital content on Hotstar app, owned by Star India. Suhel was a former staffer. The software on which the data was stored could be accessed from Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru.The cyber cops alleged that Suhel had accessed the software on August 3 despite the fact that his access code was taken back by the company on his termination of services.
 
 Ghildiyal said that he was falsely implicated in the case and was about to leave the company for better prospects.
