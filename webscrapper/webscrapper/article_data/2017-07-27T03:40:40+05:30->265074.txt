 Coming down heavily on CM   Kumar for his oft-repeated claim of ‘zero tolerance on corruption’,   boss   on Wednesday said the JD(U) national president is a named accused in a murder case lodged with Pandarak police station in Patna district and a Barh court has already taken cognisance against him.
 
  “When Nitish himself faced murder charges, how was he continuing as the CM? Committing atrocities against a person is bigger issue than corruption. Where was his zero tolerance?” Lalu told media persons soon after Nitish submitted his resignation to Bihar governor in charge K N Tripathi.
  
  Brandishing a copy of the court order related to the murder case before the media, Lalu said the murder case (FIR no. 199/ 1991) was pending in the Patna high court. He said Nitish has also mentioned it in his affidavit before the Election Commission.
  
  Lalu also revealed that Nitish telephoned him and wished him before going to the Raj Bhavan to submit his resignation. “I tried to convince him not to quit. I asked him that people of Bihar have given mandate to the grand alliance for five years,” Lalu said.
  
  Though JD(U) is to form government with BJP in Bihar, Lalu said if Nitish has not made any pact with PM Narendra Modi, he should convene a meeting of RJD, JD(U) and Congress legislators and elect a new leader of the grand alliance minus   and himself to facilitate a new government. “RJD is the bigger partner in the GA. Now, it is the turn of RJD to claim the CM’s post. I urge Nitish to call a meeting of all three allies to elect the new CM,” Lalu said.
  
  “Everything was set with BJP. That is why PM Modi lost no time in congratulating Nitish on his resignation,” Lalu quipped.
