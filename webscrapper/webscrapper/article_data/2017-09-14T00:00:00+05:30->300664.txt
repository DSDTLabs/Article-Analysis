Last month, we had told you that the Tamil film  , by Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom director  , was facing censor troubles because a dialogue in the film had the term ‘intercourse’. Despite getting a U certificate from the revising committee, the makers had told us the censor board was reluctant to issue the certificate saying “they need to clarify with Mumbai on the use of the word”. 

 But now, in a clear sign of the censor board’s change in outlook after   replaced   as the   chief, the   has been cleared with a U certificate. 
 
 Says Balaji Tharaneetharan, “Two weeks ago, we got a call from the censor board saying that our film will be cleared. And on Tuesday night, we were given the U certificate. They have not asked us to mute or replace the word intercourse.” 
 
 Quiz him on what he thinks could have led to this change of stance from the board and he replies, “Perhaps this has got to do with the replacement of the old chief and the views of the present chief.”
