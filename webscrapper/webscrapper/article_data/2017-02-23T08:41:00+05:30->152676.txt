THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After a young couple live-telecasted the humiliation they faced at the hands two Pink   squad personnel, state police chief   addressed the issue on Wednesday . He directed IG   to conduct an inquiry and submit his report.

 Vishnu SS (24) ­ a senior engineer at a private firm ­ and his friend Arathy S A (23) faced   just because Vishnu had put his arm around Arathy's shoulder. The Facebook video they posted went viral, garnering several lakhs of views.
 
 The DGP chose the same medium (social media) to convey his dissent to his subordinates, apparently in a bid to win back the trust of the public. In a status post updated on his official page, Loknath Behera said that he was pained to learn about the incident, even though he did not receive a complaint personally .
 
 The law of the land is very clear. No one has the right to disturb or harass any couple anywhere more so in public places. In our country we impose self-restrain on public display of affection (PDA) due to our culture and tradition, though there is no legal ban on  , he wrote on Facebook.
 
 However, many people in the society do not support PDA and they normally call the police. The police cannot ignore such calls, therefore they reach the place and after reaching the place they must act accordingly and follow the law with politeness, Behera said. Another side is that, sometimes an under-aged girl becomes a victim (without knowing or realizing various implications) of such act by some men. Then it is the duty of the police to ensure such that justice is done in such matters, he added.
 
 “The bottom line is that, we should interact with the people in society for whom we are working, to ensure their safety and security without infringing on their privacy and their constitutional rights,“ stated Behera's Facebook post.
