Amaravati: The state government is facilitating the release of over 5,000   people from   using the   provided by the Arab nation.

 Speaking to media persons, welfare minister for non-resident Telugus Kollu Ravindra said Telugus from AP went to Kuwait in search of various jobs, however they were booked under various cases as they were not aware of the foreign laws. In some cases, the incriminated Indians were not able to pay penalties.
 
 He said the state government had first taken up the case and referred it to the union minister for external affairs Sushma Swaraj. “As the amnesty extended by the Kuwait government is set to expire in the next three days, the state government has engaged with AP Non-Resident Telugu society to secure the release of the people,” the minister said.
 
 He said APNRT delegates have left for Kuwait and would stay there and get these people released and send them back to AP. “Most of the incriminated Telugus are from the two Godavari districts, Kadapa, and Chittoor,” the minister said. The government will provide skill training to these people after they return, he said.
