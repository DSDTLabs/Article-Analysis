The Thane crime branch said on Monday it had found three antlers and a deer   hidden by two men who were arrested last week for smuggling a   skin worth over Rs 10 lakh in the black market.

 The two, Kismatlal Marabi (30) and Korcha Marabi (25), both from Katni in   and employed as daily wage workers, had been caught by assistant inspector Sandeep Bagul and the unit one team following a tip-off that two persons were looking for customers to sell a leopard skin.
