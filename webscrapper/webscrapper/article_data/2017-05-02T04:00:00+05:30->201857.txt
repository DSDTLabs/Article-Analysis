Vadodara: Cannons are major pieces of decoration at premises of defence and police forces. While most cannons are custom-made for the premises, one cannon at rural police headquarters at Chhani is a rare piece. The cannon placed at the gate of headquarters was unearthed in Bhadarva village of Savli taluka in 2009 and was placed at old Bhadarva police station before it was moved to the then newly-constructed headquarters in Chhani. The cannon was unearthed from the backyard of house of the village in 2009. “A woman was digging in the backyard of her house when she found a piece of metal. She contacted us as she got frightened by it,” said Sama police inspector M M Puwar, who was posted at Bhadarva police station as police sub-inspector. Puwar had added that he had sent cops from the police station to check about it. When further digging was done, a cannon was found. The police then took the custody of the cannon, got it cleaned and painted and placed it at Bhadarva police station. “The old Bhadarva police station was from the princely state era. So, we got the cannon refurbished and placed it there,” Puwar told TOI. “Later that year when the then superintendent of police B S Jebaliya visited the police station, he liked the cannon and said that it should be placed at the newly-constructed headquarters,” added Puwar. Currently, the cannon, placed at the gate of rural police headquarters lies among the cannons that were custom-made but no mention of its history is available anywhere in the premises. In fact, when TOI enquired about it, the cops posted at the headquarters were completely unaware about it. The other custom-made cannons are placed on concrete platforms while this rare piece has been attached to a wooden log on wheels. A policeman said that cannons are placed at headquarters and camps of defence and police to signify that a force is stationed there.
