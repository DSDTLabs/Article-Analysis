PATIALA: Punjab forest department is all set to distribute over 25 lakh free saplings this year to maintain ecological balance and bring government and private institutions under green cover.

 It will not only distribute these saplings to a number of institutions but also cover the government departments and institutions under its ‘Punjab Mission Scheme'.
 
 "The forest department would distribute the saplings under this scheme to the educational, social, religious institutions apart from military and para military forces. It would be mandatory for the concerned institutions to carefully nurture the saplings so as to fulfil the purpose to increase greenery," said Punjab forest and wildlife preservation minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot.
 
 Under the scheme, the forest department has also formulated a comprehensive plan to prepare herbal garden at  , Pathankot, Sri Muktsar Sahib, Bathinda and Patiala during this fiscal year besides having medicinal plants at appropriate places. For this, an amount of Rs 1.25 crore would be spent. TNN
 
 Besides this, a project plan worth Rs 8 crore concerning agro-forestry has been sent to the union government for approval which aims at bringing maximum area in the state under forest cover and increasing the income of the farmers. Under this project, the farmers would be encouraged to plant saplings on their land holdings and would also be provided financial assistance for the purpose.
 
 The minister claimed that the forest department has established two modern nurseries at Hoshiarpur and Patiala in previous three months in order to prepare good quality saplings for plantation to increase forest cover. He also said, the department under ‘Green Punjab Mission' has grown 180 lakh saplings of different types in various nurseries.
