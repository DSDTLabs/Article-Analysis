AHMEDABAD: Indian Coast Guard ( ) rescued 16 crew members of two sinking large, flat-bottomed barges, in two days, off the   coast. 

 The stricken barges later were towed to Jakhau harbour. The crew members of both were given first aid and taken to Jakhau.
 
 According to Defense PRO Wing Commander  , on Saturday evening an ICG interceptor boat on a routine patrol received a message from the barge MV Priya seeking assistance due to flooding on board.
 
 On reaching the spot, they found that the barge was flooded up to the bridge level and the forecastle and ship’s side were completely submerged.
 
 “Only the quarter deck was partly visible and eight crew members were onboard,” said Wing Commander Matiman.
 
 The ICG team guided the crew to deploy and board the life raft of the barge. Thereafter a rope was attached to the raft and it was pulled to safety.
 
 The second assistance call was received by ICG on Sunday noon from the salt barge Karishma‘. “It was assessed that sea water had accumulated in the carriage area. VHF communication was established and barge was guided to use local sea water system for deflooding and to seal all compartments to make it watertight. On restoring stable conditions the barge was escorted to Jakhau harbour by the ICG ship,” said Matiman.
