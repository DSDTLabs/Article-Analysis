" " actress   has said she is a "controlling" wife and mother.
 
  The 51-year-old actress - who has son James Wilkie, 14, and twin daughters Tabitha and Loretta, seven, with husband   - said she takes on responsibility for the majority of household tasks but still feels surprised at how well her spouse copes when she's away with her work, reported Contactmusic.
  
  
 
  
 
  
  
  "I do a lot because I'm controlling. I'm a person who is fastidious and exacting and so I do a huge amount. What is surprising is how much my husband can do and does in my absence.
  
  "Everybody gets where they need to be. But still, he's not going to put everything away at night. When I come home, I can see the path of mess," she said.
