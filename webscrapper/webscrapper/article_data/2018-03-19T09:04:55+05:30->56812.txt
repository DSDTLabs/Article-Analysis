THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State finance commission chairman B A   termed the reasons cited by the   for rejecting a slew of suggestions in the commission report as baseless and said the   has lost the right to continue in the post.

 In a statement here on Friday, Prakash said the finance minister’s arguments did not hold much substance.
 
 The government had been meticulously studying the report, which leads to two years delay in implementing the same, the minister said while justifying the delay in implementing the report.
 
 “This is nothing but a serious dereliction of duty and violation of the constitution,” said Prakash. The minister’s argument that GST implications were the reasons for the government rejecting the recommendation that local self-institutions should be given their due in the state’s tax share on actual basis was not acceptable, he said.
 
 “Corruption and nepotism can be suspected behind the decision to reject the recommendation that maintenance funds to local bodies should be given on the basis of assets. It is now given based on mere assumptions,” he said.
 
 By rejecting the recommendation that state government should set apart 11% to 14.5% of its tax revenue for local self-government, the government had thrown to winds its constitutional obligations, he said. According to him, he did not understand the logic behind Isaac’s claim that the recommendation, if implemented, would upset the existing plan outlay.
 
 “It is a paradox that   who had been accusing the state finance commission of trying to weaken the local bodies has now cut down by 19% the tax revenue share to LSGIs as against the recommendations by the fifth financial commission,” he added.
