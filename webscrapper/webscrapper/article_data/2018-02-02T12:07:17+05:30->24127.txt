 –   film ‘Ira’ seems to have a tempting jukebox, if its newly released song is any indication. Its song ‘Oru Mozhi Parayam,’ sung by Vijay Yesudas and Mridula Warrier is here and it is a nostalgic and romantic melody track, composed by Gopi Sunder.

 
  
 
 The song is penned by Hari Narayanan and is featured on Miya and Unni Mukundan, in a beautiful, rustic setting. With images of tuskers in the forest, tribal customs, kayaking on ‘changaadam,’ exploring swift rapids and the night sky, the song is filled with natural beauty.
 
 The film is directed by Saiju S and it has script by Naveen John. Gokul Suresh also plays an important character in the movie.
