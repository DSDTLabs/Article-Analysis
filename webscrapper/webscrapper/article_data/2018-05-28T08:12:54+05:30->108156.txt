 Addressing a gathering of khaps at Meham, president of Aithgama khap   said some youth marry within same gotra, same village and neighbourhood or brotherhood villages. “This ultimately leads to discords between families,” he claimed, adding that society and parents did not approve of such relations “but the courts gave legitimacy to such marriages, which was against the society’s culture and tradition”.
 
 He claimed that earlier their ancestors maintained and preserved the distinct culture even when the country was under the rule of Mughals and British but such things were given patronage in free country was a shocking thing.
 
 Quoting the example of Jallikuttu, he said that the   had banned on the celebration of the religious event but after facing widespread protest, the court had to reconsider its decision as the matter was related to people’s faith.   said that a delegation of khap leaders would soon meet the Union law minister and seek amendment in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
 
 Former MLA  , who also attended the meeting, asked the participants to register their protest by holding massive protests on roads to press their demands for the amendment in the Hindu Marriage Act. The khap leaders also passed resolution to work to end practices of playing DJs in marriage functions, holding mass feast on the death of elderly person and uploading of vulgar content on internet.
