Rajkot:   

 Police identified the deceased as Mukesh Behari (35) and accused as Ramesh Koli (28). Both Behari and Koli were friends and used to lead a vagabond lifestyle. Both used to work at the farm of Dharmesh Kangad (34) as labourers. However, as Behari was a habitual drunkard and would come to work in an inebriated state, he was sacked from the job four days ago. 
 
 “Behari thought that he had been sacked at the instigation of Koli and harbouring a grudge against him he came to the farm on Saturday to argue with him in a drunken state. He started hurling abuses at Koli, following which both fought. When Behari beat up Koli, he picked up an axe dealt him several blows, hacking him to death on the spot,” said an official from Kuvadava Road police station where the case in this regard has been registered. 
 
 “However, after killing Behari, instead of running away, Koli produced himself before the police and surrendered. He said that he got extremely incensed with Behari and in a fit of rage hacked him to death,” the official added.
