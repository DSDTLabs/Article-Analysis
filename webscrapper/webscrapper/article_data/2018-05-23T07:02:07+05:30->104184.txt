BENGALURU: The primary and secondary education department on Tuesday sent notices to the   Group of Institutions for allegedly lobbying with vendors and forcing parents to buy textbooks from the school at higher rates.

 The notices were sent based on a complaint from the Karnataka Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools. The association had complained to the education department and the commissioner of department of public instruction (DPI) against Baldwin Co-Education Extension High School and many other private schools, accusing them of “indulging in business with publishers or textbook vendors.”
 
 Parents of students of Baldwin school in   had protested on Monday against the management. They also complained that Class X students had not got their textbooks despite classes having already begun. 
 
 The books that have been displayed do not comply with NCERT or ICSE syllabi, they alleged. The school management has rubbished the claims.
 
 D Shashi Kumar, general secretary, Karnataka Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools, said: “We have complained earlier also about managements of schools for lobbying with publishers. They were giving textbooks from publishers that do not comply with NCERT syllabus. By having such books, they create a demand and force parents to buy the whole set from these publishers at exorbitant prices. We cannot use only textbooks as they come with notebooks,” he added.
 
 He pointed out that this is in violation of the government’s February 6 order, wherein the schools are not supposed to compel parents to purchase books from one vendor or directly from schools.
 
 Meeting today
 
 We’ll meet the District Education Regulation Authority (DERA) and DDPIs from Bengaluru on Wednesday to take steps against such schools. I’ve instructed all DDPIs to put up such complaints before the district commissioner in the meeting.
