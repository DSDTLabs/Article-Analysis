NEW DELHI:   president   assessed the   government as “failure” on performance but “topper” in “self-promotion and slogan creation,” as the lead opposition party observed the fourth anniversary of   regime as “Betrayal Day” across the country with protests. 

 
 Besides grading Modi regime “F”, Rahul Gandhi put down “remarks” on his progress report that PM   was a “master communicator” who “struggles with complex issues” and has “short attention span”. Interestingly, he graded the government as “B-minus” on yoga. Senior leader Ashok Gehlot said never had the country been betrayed as in the last four years and no prime minister had compromised the dignity of the PMO like Modi has. 
 
 “There are lies in every statement Modi makes and every statistic he gives,” Gehlot told a press conference he addressed with senior leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and spokesperson Randeep Surjewala. The three leaders released a booklet “India betrayed”, listing 40 questions for PM Modi, ranging from economy to national security and jobs to rural distress. 
 
 Gehlot said “Modi’s trickery” was evident in the way he has claimed that BJP had electrified 18000 villages, not spelling out that Congress had electrified 97% of the around 7 lakh villages. Congress said publicity hype apart, the fact was that the Modi regime had failed on key parameters of economy, jobs, rural economy and security of weaker sections. 
 
 On corruption, Surjewala said even the government statistics accept that NPAs in banks have shot up by Rs 6 lakh crore in last four years, highlighting the flight of scamsters like Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya. The party said foreign policy was in a drift with flip-flops instead of steady thinking in the government attitude towards Pakistan and China. It also highlighted the “growing atrocities on Dalits.”
