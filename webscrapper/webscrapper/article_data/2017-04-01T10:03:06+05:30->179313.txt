AMRITSAR: Hoping for cordial India-Pakistan ties,   social organisation   has expressed its desire to extend its philanthropic network to India on Friday, a day the Pakistan government issued a special coin in the honour of the trust’s chairman, late   Edhi.

 Edhi Foundation is the only Pakistani   which offers gifts and aid to Indian prisoners after they are released by the authorities in the neighbouring country. The foundation is also arranges transportation up to Wagah border.
 
 The foundation came to the limelight in 2015, after it helped reunite a 24-year-old speech and hearing disabled girl, Geeta, with her family in India. Geeta had strayed into Pakistan at the age of 11 and had stayed at Edhi Foundation’s centre throughout. The centre had made special arrangements for her to worship according to Hindu rituals. “We had earlier opened one of our centres in Bengaluru in early 1990s, but it had to be closed down after objections by the Indian government. We are waiting for the right time to approach the India to let us extend our helping hand,” Faisal Edhi, son of late Abdul Sattar and a managing trustee of the foundation, told TOI after receiving the Pakistan’s Rs 50 commemorative coin issued in the honour of his father.
 
 Faisal said they planned to gift the next batch of repatriated Indian prisoners the coin dedicated to his father. He said Edhi Foundation had over 350 centres, including orphanages, old-age homes, morgues and maternity wards, across Pakistan. The trust also has the largest fleet of ambulances in the neighbouring country. “We are now going to start air-ambulance services that will be helpful for shifting seriously ill Indian prisoners to the border after their release,” Faisal said.
