LUCKNOW: Two   faculty members were booked for   of a 23-year-old patient during surgery. Native of  , Prithvi Raj had undergone an intestinal surgery at KGMU in February 2015 and was discharged next month.

 Early this year, Raj developed acute pain in the abdomen and was advised to undergo ultrasound test. When he saw the report, he was shocked to find one of his kidneys missing.
 
 On Saturday, Raj approached Barabanki Kotwali to complain against KGMU doctors and a government doctor at Barabanki district hospital who had referred him to KGMU in 2015.
 
 Officer-in-charge of Barabanki Kotwali S P Singh said Raj named two KGMU professors. “He did not know the name of the government doctor in Barabanki. We have pressed IPC section 420 and sections 18, 19 and 20 under Transplantation of Human Organs Act against two KGMU doctors who have been named,” said Singh. Raj has named heads of KGMU’s endocrine surgery and trauma surgery departments in his compliant.
 
 Police have asked Raj to submit his medical history and share the name of the ultrasound centre where he had undergone examination in April in Barabanki. Police were also waiting for findings of the high level committee constituted on Friday by minister of medical education Ashutosh Tandon in this regard. The enquiry committee will be headed by SGPGI doctors and is expected to be ready in a fortnight.
 
 Spokesperson of KGMU, doctor Nar Singh Verma said the question of removing   doesn’t arise as KGMU does not have kidney transplant unit. “But we want facts to come out and will provide everything to assist police and the enquiry committee,” said Verma.
