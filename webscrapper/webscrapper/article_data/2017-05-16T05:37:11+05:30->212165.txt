AHMEDABAD: The   government has finally withdrawn its application for declaring nilgai and wild boar as vermin. The step would have allowed killing of the animals as menace to standing crops in 17 districts of the state. Rather than allowing hunting, the state government has decided to subsidize 9,750km of fencing around farms.

 The state wildlife board had in a meeting in April refused to permit the forest department to legalize hunting of wild boar and nilgai . Even before the state board considered the proposal, the state government had already applied to the   to exempt the state from the ban on hunting of these animals under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
 
 The state board in April had decided that instead of killing the animals it would promote fencing around the fields. 
 
 A budget allocation of Rs 200 crore was also made.
 
 On Friday, as part of the Gujarat governmentâ€™s policy of non-violence towards wildlife, chief minister Vijay Rupani sanctioned 97.50-lakh metres of barbed wire for fencing to check the menace of nilgai and wild boars.
 
 The menace is rampant in 17 districts of the state, namely Kutch, Devbhumi-Dwarka, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Morbi, Botad, Surendranagar, Patan, Banaskantha, Mehsana, Sabarkantha,  , Ahmedabad, Anand, Kheda and Vadodara.
