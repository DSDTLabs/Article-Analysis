KOLKATA: Minerva Punjab and Aizawl FC’s back to back title triumphs further emphasized that the old guard with the likes of   and   could be losing their bearing, if not relevance, in the top league. And the less said about Churchill Brothers the better. The lone Goan outfit looked a rag-tag outfit and it showed in their insipid campaign that led to their relegation.

 
 On the green Maidan of Kolkata, where only victory counts, Bagan and East Bengal’s campaigns are already being viewed as failures. But all is not lost for these clubs.
 
 Manipuri coach Gift Raikhan, who guided Neroca FC to the runners-up finish in their debut season, stood by the Big Two on Thursday. “East Bengal and Mohun Bagan may not have become champions but they are always the big teams. They have always been the torchbearers of Indian football,” he said.
 
 Statistics, however, reveal something else.
 
 In 11 seasons of National Football League - precursor to I-League - the Big Two shared six titles. But since the 2007-2008 season, Mohun Bagan managed to win the top league just once (in 2014-2015) while East Bengal are yet to break the I-League duck.
 
 “I came here and decided to manage East Bengal because it’s a pleasure for every coach to work in the city. I joined the club as an ILeague champion (with Aizawl FC) and there were great expectations all around the club about winning this elusive title. I’m disappointed because it didn’t happen. If someone is to be blamed, it’s me, no one else,” East Bengal coach Khalid Jamil said.
 
 It was also another disappointing season for Mohun Bagan, finished in third, ahead of East Bengal.
 
 “There’s no point of dwelling on what could have happened. Yes, we failed to grab our chances but luck was also not on our side,” Mohun Bagan coach Shankarlal Chakraborty said after seeing his team share the spoils with Gokulam Kerala FC 1-1 in Kozhikode.
 
 Mohun Bagan finished this I-League with local bragging rights, having beaten East Bengal in both legs.
