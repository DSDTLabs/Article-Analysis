Ranjith Shankar's upcoming film   is shrouded by mystery as neither the director, not the lead actor,   is ready to talk much about the film as of now.

  However, the director reveals that this would be the first time in the history of Malayalam cinema that a lead actor acts as a woman, and not dressed up as a woman. And the inspiration for the movie was a make up person the director came across who was with  , he says. It was during the shoot of the film Pretham that he came across the person, and it dawned on him the struggles such people experience, he says.
 
 Jayasurya's look as a woman had surfaced but no more details were revealed.
