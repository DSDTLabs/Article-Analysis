He must immediately issue a public apology or tender his resignation,’’ he added, alleging that it was Nagar who was aiming at ‘cheap publicity’ ahead of the assembly elections, which are due this year.

They are not concerned about our well-being,” said another farmer leader  .
 
 Meanwhile farmers’ body associated with   led by Kundan Chetha burnt his effigy in  . When contacted by TOI, Nagar refuted allegation of having mocked or insulted the farmers. “My statements on farmer’s suicide have been twisted and projected in a different way.
