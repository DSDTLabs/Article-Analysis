LUCKNOW: A Lucknow court has referred the case of missing IIM-L student Subhadip Das to anti-humantrafficking unit (AHTU) to find him in eight weeks’ time.

 Das went missing from the IIM-L campus on July 18 last year but the Madiaon police lodged a missing case only on July 24. The parents of the missing youth met the Union home minister on September 25, demanding a   into matter, they filed a petition in the high court of Lucknow.
 
 On Monday, the court had issued an order stating that Lucknow SSP will supervise the investigation carried out by AHTU. Investigation officer of the case   has been directed to investigate the case from all the possible angles.
 
 Missing youth’s counsel   told TOI that the court has given two months for the search operation. The next hearing is on April 4. Gupta also said that Das had taken exam on the day he went missing. “If Subhadip had to go out in such a way, why would he have taken the exam,” she said.
 
 Shubhadip’s father Uttam Kumar Das alleged that the Madiaon police has not taken the case seriously. “Only one SI was sent to search for my   in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh, with no access to technology. He showed no interest in searching for my son,” he said.
