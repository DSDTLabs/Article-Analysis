BHOPAL: A three-day old baby on Friday joined the long list of people who owe thanks to External Affairs Minister   for her prompt response to calls for help made on Twitter. But unlike many others who've been helped by the minister, young Om Sharma can thank her for helping him travel to Delhi for heart surgery. 

 Both Swaraj and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister   helped have Om flown from Bhopal to New Delhi today, for treatment at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. 
 
  
  
 
 Om Sharma was born on January 23. His parents, Bengaluru-based software engineer   and Vandana Sharma - who lives in Bhopal - learned that he suffered from a transposition of arteries (inter-ventricular septum), and needed surgery urgently. But no doctors agreed to help them.
 
 Om had a breathing problem, and was battling to stay alive. His family decided to seek help from the nation's ministers. On January 25, his maternal uncle   tweeted about the boy's condition, and tagged Prime Minister   and Union Health Minister J P Nadda. 
 
 The tweet was shared by over 1,200 people. 
 
 Sushma Swaraj learned about Om when Maharashtra Congress secretary   tweeted to her. She responded immediately, and asked for the number of Om’s father, Devesh. 
 
 Dushyant Dwivedi said, “We did not expect such a quick response. We got a call from her on January 27 morning and were told that all the arrangements have been made at   for his treatment. The family flew to Delhi at about 5 PM.”
 
 He said the family is thankful to everyone "who took our voice to the ministers and specially Sushma Swaraj." They're now just praying for Om's well-being and quick recovery, he added.
