 BENGALURU: The joy of climbing trees, plucking mangoes and throwing them to your friends eagerly waiting below needn’t be a nostalgic feeling, thanks to   organised at Savi Farm in Garudapalya, a village in Kolar district. The farm is home to more than thousands of mango trees.
 
 Each morning and evening, four-hour trails allow people to wander around the orchards, climb trees, pluck mangoes and feast on them. “During my childhood, I would go to my ajji mane (grandmother’s home) and climb trees along with my brothers and pluck mangoes. After 25 years, I relived the moment,” said Priyanka Bhat, a resident of Jayanagar, who was taking part in Sunday’s trail. 
 
 The first year of Mango Trails was very special for Savi Farm’s owner   Byre Gowda and her family. There were 200 visitors in 2017. 
 
 “It was more of an experiment. This season has been very exciting as we’ve had many trails already and the farm is abuzz with activities,” Meenakshi said, adding that they are expecting about 300 visitors. The trails are held on Sundays during May and June. 
 
 “The last time I climbed a tree was during my college days to pluck raw mangoes. I felt so happy when I climbed again as my son’s jaws dropped looking at me doing it,” said Shankar N, a resident of Malleswaram. 
 
 Savi Farm is run by Meenakshi’s mother and sister-in-law. “They love this place and feel everyone should experience moments that are not too frequent in urban life,” Meenakshi said, adding that mangoes are grown naturally.
