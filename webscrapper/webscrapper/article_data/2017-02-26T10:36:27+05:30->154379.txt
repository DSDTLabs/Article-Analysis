PANAJI: The state government has called a one-day assembly session on Tuesday as it is mandatory to convene a session of the legislative assembly within six months of its last sitting.
 
  Speaking to TOI, chief minister   said that the session has been called to fulfill the constitutional mandate. “We will not take any policy decision,” he said. “After considering all the circumstances and seeking legal opinion, we’ve decided to call the session.”
  
  Parsekar said that the opposition demanded either the dissolution of the House, or an assembly session. “We can’t do injustice to MLAs by dissolving the House,” he said.
  
  Governor   will address the assembly during the session. A senior officer at the Assembly said that the file has been moved to the governor to summon the assembly session on February 28. She approved the file. The notices to the MLAs will be issued on Monday, he said.
  
  A division bench of the Bombay high court had directed the Goa government to inform the court on February 27 of its stand in view of a   judgment making in mandatory to convene a session within six months of its last sitting.
  
  The court direction came after a petition by advocate  , seeking directions to the state government to comply with Article 174 of the Constitution.
  
  Recently, Advocate General (AG)  , in his opinion given to the state government, had said that there is no need to either dissolve the assembly or convene an assembly session, as polling has already taken place on February 4.
  
  Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) had demanded that the Governor dissolve the state legislative assembly and impose President's rule in Goa, since the meeting of the legislative assembly has not been convened for six months.
