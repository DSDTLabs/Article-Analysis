NEW DELHI: The   Budget has been hiked by 7.81% to Rs 2,95,511 crore amid expectations of a higher allocation due to heightened tensions with both Pakistan and China.

 The defence outlay works out to just about 1.58% of the projected GDP for 2018-19, the lowest since the 1962 war. Though this figure has been declining in percentage terms as the economy expands, military experts contend it should be over 2% to ensure that the armed forces are capable of tackling the “collusive threat” from Pakistan and China.
 
 The capital allocation for MoD under BE 2018-19 is 33.1% of expenditure on capital account, which is Rs 3,00,441crore.
 
 Government will bring out an industry-friendly defence production policy to promote domestic arms production by public and private sectors as well as MSMEs, said FM Arun  , adding that two defence industrial production corridors will be set up.
 
 Defence minister   said, “This paves the way for the first defence production corridor to come up in Tamil Nadu, linking small and medium units running from Chennai, Mysore, Coimbatore, Salem and Tiruchirappali right up to Bengaluru. The two corridors will encourage Make in India.”
 
 This year’s defence Budget, accounting for 12.10% of central expenditure, includes a capital outlay of just Rs 99,563.86 crore for new weapon systems and modernisation, which is dwarfed by the revenue expenditure of Rs 1,95,947.55 crore.
 
 Another major worry is the ballooning defence pension bill, which now stands at Rs1,08,853 crore, in addition to the outlay. Also, 70-80% of defence capital outlay goes to instalments for earlier arms deals, leaving very little for modernisation projects.
 
 Focusing on border connectivity, Jaitley said: “Rohtang tunnel has been completed to provide all-weather connectivity to Ladakh. Contract for construction of Zozila Pass tunnel is progressing well. I now propose to take up construction of tunnel under Sela Pass (in Arunachal, a site of fierce battles in 1962).”
