MUMBAI: The   resumed the dedicated 11-km cycling track in south Mumbai on Sunday morning. But the event saw a low response compared to last December, when the initiative was kicked off. 

 “We will issue advertisements so that more enthusiasts are aware that the   has been restarted. We hope to continue this in the long run,” said assistant municipal commissioner Kiran Dighavkar.
 
 The cycle track will be operational on Sundays from 6.30am to 10.30am between   and Girgaum Chowpatty. The BMC is contemplating on allowing cycling even during monsoon, when it is not raining.
 
 Barely a few weeks after its launch, the initiative was interrupted on some Sundays, either due to traffic restrictions like VIP movement or events like Mumbai Marathon. Then, there was an issue between BMC and the organizers to arrange for a sponsor to recover expenses. Eventually, the BMC put the plan in cold storage. 
 
 This time, the BMC is funding the project itself and a radio channel is managing it. Sources said the BMC will pay Rs 3.5 lakh for each cycling event to the contractor, including expenses incurred for towing vans, traffic wardens, and bollards along the track. tnn
