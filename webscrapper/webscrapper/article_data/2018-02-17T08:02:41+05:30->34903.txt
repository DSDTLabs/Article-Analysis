KOCHI: State Bank of India ( ) chairman   has said that the bank does not have any exposure to the Nirav Modi-led group. However, it does have some credit exposure to Gitanjali Gems. The bank also has a $212-million exposure to   ( ), arising out of loans against letters of undertaking (LoUs) provided by the bank.

 
 Speaking to newspersons during the launch of SBI's global NRI centre in Kochi, Kumar said that the bank's loan exposure to the gems and jewellery segment was around 1% of its loan book. "My domestic loan book is Rs 16 lakh crore and gems and jewellery sector exposure is less than Rs 13,000 crore," said Kumar. He said that the bank is very careful as far as the gems and jewellery industry is concerned. "We have been taking steps to put a lot of risk-mitigation measures for accounts from the sector," said Kumar.
 
 In the PNB fraud case, Kumar said that for all financing banks, exposure would lie with the issuing lender, that is, PNB. "They might have sold to other banks. But whether we have bought or any other bank has bought, ultimately the exposure is on the bank which has issued the letter of undertaking," said Kumar in response to a query on reports that SBI has purchased loans from Axis Bank.
 
 Kumar said that SBI has linked its SWIFT messaging terminal to the core banking system. According to bankers, the fraud in PNB was facilitated by the fact that the SWIFT messaging system was not linked to the core banking system, which resulted in unauthorised use going undetected. SWIFT is a messaging system used in banks for cross-border instructions on funds transfers and guarantees provided by banks.
 
 "One of the risk-management practices which we follow is job rotation. We don't keep a person for more than three years at one position. There are certain positions which are very sensitive and we monitor those positions very closely," said Kumar.
