KOCHI: Private hospitals mainly allow government insurance schemes to get more patients and private medical colleges prefer insurance schemes to get more general category patients as mandated by   (MCI).

 “Hospitals mainly go for volume, especially when they start a new venture. For medical colleges, they need general category patients as required by MCI or hospitals will be forced to conduct camps to attract patients. In Kerala it is a different ballgame as people don’t want to be admitted in the general ward,” said Dr  , medical superintendent at  .
 
 “Most of them come as the waiting list at government hospitals is high or for a second or third opinion. Others come to see specialist doctors,” he added.
 
 While state government has stopped empanelling new hospitals under Karunya scheme to provide financial aid for poor people suffering from serious ailments since last one year, many private hospitals are wary of accepting patients under   (RSBY) as there is often a delay in payment. Under Karunya, Rs 60,000 to Rs 2 lakh can be spent, under RSBY the maximum amount is Rs 30,000.
 
 “Nearly Rs 150 crore is pending in all hospitals with RSBY as most of the 20 private medical colleges are part of the scheme,” said Farhaan Yasin, Calicut Kerala Private Hospitals Association ( ) secretary.
