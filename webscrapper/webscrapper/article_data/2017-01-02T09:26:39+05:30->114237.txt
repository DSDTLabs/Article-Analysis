NASHIK: The   of the country has increased almost threefold from   for this fiscal as compared to the corresponding period of   2015-16 due to removal of   (MEP) and introduction of 5% subsidy for exporters from August 26. 

 Sources from National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) said, "The onion export has increased to 13.56 lakh metric tonne during the first half of the FY 2016-17, against 4.84 lakh metric tonne during the same period in financial year 2015-16. The total onion export may touch 21-22 lakh metric tonne." 
 
 The onion export of the country is expected to touch highest-ever figure this financial year. Earlier, the highest onion export was recorded at 18.73 metric tonne during the financial year 2009-10.
 
 Nafed director Nanasaheb Patil said, "The onion export has increased threefold because of the zero Minimum Export Price (MEP) of onions and also introduction of Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) benefits at 5% for onion exporters, which have been extended upto March 31."
 
 "This year, there had been excess onion production in the country. Around 25 lakh metric tonne production was in excess in the country. Hence, onion export is still low considering higher production of onions," he said. 
 
 Moreover, the average wholesale onion prices have declined to the range of Rs 550-Rs 600 per quintal. The cost of production for growing onions is around Rs 900 per quintal. Hence, farmers are still incurring heavy losses. 
 
 "This has also led to the rise in export. Farmers actually must benefit from onion export. Earlier, there were some specific onion growing pockets, but areas under onion plantation are spreading now. Hence, government need to make a proper policy to match the demand and supply of onions," Patil added.
