GHAZIABAD: Two circle officers and four station house officers (SHOs) were transferred in the district on Thursday night. Two days earlier, as many as 36 sub-inspectors were shifted by SSP Vaibhav Krishna. 

 The transfer orders came hours after the state government amended its earlier order regarding posting and transfer of SHOs at police stations wherein district police chiefs were required to seek a written approval from district magistrates before making such changes.
 
 As per the amended order, the district police chiefs can now post and transfer the police station in-charge after mutual consultation and agreement with the DMs and no prior written approval of the latter is required.
 
 Assistant superintendent of police Ravi Kumar, who was serving as circle officer,  , has now been deputed as circle officer, Indirapuram. Dharmendra Singh Chauhan, who was circle officer, Indirapuram, took Kumar’s place in Modinagar.
 
 The post of SHOs at Kavi Nagar and Vijay Nagar police stations were lying vacant since May 19 after the SSP shunted out the then incharges, Samarjeet Singh (Kavi Nagar) and Naresh Kumar Singh (Vijay Nagar), over their failure to curb the extortion racket run by some gangs targeting iron traders. 
 
 The two inspectors were sent to the police lines, even as an inquiry was ordered into their roles in the nexus.
 
 Now, inspector  , who was posted at the police lines, has been given the charge of Kavi Nagar police station. Likewise, Rameshwar Kumar, who was posted as  , Bhojpur till now, has been transferred to Vijay Nagar. Inspector  , posted at Loni as senior sub-inspector, has taken place of Rameshwar Kumar’s in Bhojpur.
