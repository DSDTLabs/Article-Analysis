MUMBAI: Two days after a resident doctor was assaulted at   by a patient's son, police arrested a 34-yearold man for allegedly attacking a male nurse with a dressing scissor and injuring him severely at   railway hospital.

 The incident took place around 2am on Saturday. “We have arrested the accused,  , an Ambernath resident. His brother-inlaw,  , was admitted to the hospital. Around 11.30pm on Friday, Lote asked the nurse,   (25), for a bed and bedsheet. Pawar told Lote that the hospital had no such facility for a patient's caretaker and an argument ensued. The railway protection force personnel posted at the hospital were called, after which Lote left.
 
 Around 2am, Lote again demanded a bed and bedsheet and Pawar again refused. “This time, Lote took a dressing scissor and attacked Pawar, who sustained injuries above his eye, to his chest and left arm. Pawar is stable and out of danger but will require a minor operation,“ said a doctor. Police said Lote may have been drunk.
