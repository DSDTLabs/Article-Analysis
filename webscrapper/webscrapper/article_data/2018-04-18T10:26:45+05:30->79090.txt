BHUBANESWAR: The   ( ) has announced a special training programme for government high schools of the state during the ensuing summer vacation. During the training the teachers will be given training on the method and syllabus of International and National Mathematics Olympiads.

 
 “Earlier we used to organise mathematics camps for students in summer to prepare them for the Olympiads. But we found that when they go back to home they find it difficult to clear their doubts due to lack of properly trained teachers. So we thought of training teachers so that they can help students preparing for the national and international level competitions,” said director of IMA, A K  .
 
 He said, every year at least three to four students get selected among contestants for the National Mathematics Olympiad. Students of   also perform really well in different mathematics competitions in the country, he added.
 
  “The questions that will appear in these Olympiads will be beyond the text books and explicitly new, which would not have appeared anywhere before. Though they will be based on the high school curriculum, but for that the students need to have a different approach. They may have to be given special training for that. So we decided to train the teachers,” said Mishra.
 
 IMA had started the teachers’ training from last year during which 545 teachers underwent the training. This year also the premier institute is expecting around 550 participants from across the state for the training.
 
 “With the application the teachers have to write why they want to join the training and we also select them on the basis of their experience and seniority,” Mishra added.
 
 The training period will begin from May 7 and will continue till June 30 in different batches. IMA will provide transport, accommodation and food to the participants.
