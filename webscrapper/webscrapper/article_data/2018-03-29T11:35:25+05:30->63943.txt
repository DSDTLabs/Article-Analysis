 The court also directed the respondents (district collector and district manager of Tasmac) either to appear in person or send their government pleaders to appear on behalf of them before the court on April 2.
 
 The district legal services authority (DLSA) has also sought the court to pass a permanent prohibitory injunction and a mandatory injunction to shift the outlet to any other unobjectionable place, said  , secretary of  , Tiruvannamalai.
 
 The DLSA took the issue following a plethora of complaints from public and advocates highlighting the public nuisance due to the presence of the   9269 near the bus stand. “We had issued a notice to the respondents on January 29 this year following several complaints pleading to relocate the liquor shop from the present location. They neither responded nor took any action to address the issue,” said Rajmohan, senior civil judge of DLSA.
 
 Hence the DLSA’s chairperson and principal district judge G Mahizhenthi and its members have passed an official resolution authorising its secretary to initiate legal action against the respondents.
