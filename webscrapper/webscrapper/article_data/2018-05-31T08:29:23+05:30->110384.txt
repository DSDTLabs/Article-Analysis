CHENNAI: More than 12,000 final year engineering students from 160   affiliated to   are in a fix as their exam   have been withheld for no fault of theirs. 

 The results were not released for two reasons – the college administrations did not sent an adequate number of staff for evaluation and also had not paid their pending dues – university officials told TOI. 
 
 Nearly one lakh students from over 500   colleges took the final semester exams between April 23 and May 16. 
 
 The university's controller of examinations had announced that results for these exams would be released last week. Though most colleges were able to access the results from the official website, students from 160 colleges were unable to find out their scores. 
 
 When these students approached their respective colleges, they came to know that the results were withheld due to the ‘non-compliance’ of the institutions.
 
 "We had requested all the colleges to send 70% of the available staff strength for evaluating the answer scripts. There was a very poor response from these colleges," said an Anna University official. Besides this, some colleges did not pay the registration fee (Rs.150 per head) collected from students. Consequently, students in no way responsible for the mess were affected.
 
 "The university is playing with students' lives. I have paid lakhs for my son's admission in a foreign university. The date for visa verification is nearing and he will not be able to join the college without his semester scores," said an aggrieved parent from Chennai. 
 
 Responding to this, the university official said that the exam results could have been released much earlier if colleges had cooperated by sending their staff. “We are releasing results as and when we receive an explanation from the college chairpersons,” he said.
