BHOPAL: Prominent film maker   is producing a 25-minute documentary on Narmada Seva Yatra. Jha, maker of Bollywood hits like Damul, Mrityudand, Gangaajal, Raajneeti and Aarakshan among others, has been shooting it for the past few months.

 On Monday, Jha was sitting in the back rows of the Academy of Administration building during the inaugural ceremony of the day-long brainstorming session to prepare a road map to carry forward the Narmada Seva Yatra. One of the cameras shooting the event was Jha’s professional camera used for commercial film making.
 
 However, when reporters approached him and want to know about the documentary, he refused to divulge details.
 
 The state government has hired Jha for producing a documentary, sources said.
 
 “Jha had a day-long shoot when Dalai   participated in the Narmada Seva Yatra on March 18. He also had elaborate shooting sessions at Barman Ghat in Narsinghpur district, among other places,” sources said. Besides, he has also shot visuals of most of the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s walk on foot, especially when he was amidst the public, they added.
 
 The ‘Namami Devi Narmade’ campaign started on December 11, 2016 from Amarkantak, the river’s origin and would culminate at the same place on May 11. Prime minister   would take part in the event to mark conclusion of the five-month-long yatra.
 
 The government mobilised a large number of Bollywood stars to take part in the yatra during the past five months. Superstar Amitabh Bachchan also extended support to the yatra by appreciating the campaign in a 1.16 minute video message sent to the state government in February this year.
