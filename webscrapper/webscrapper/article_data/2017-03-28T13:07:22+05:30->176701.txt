THANE: After receiving a good response in the previous years of the   admission process, this year the   seems to have fizzled out as close to 30% of the selected applicants in the district did not confirm their seat after the first lottery list was out this year. This was shown in a data provided by the district  .

 Out of 5,042 students who were selected in various schools in the first list, 1,471 did not approach the schools to claim their seat.After the first list was announced on March 6, parents were given a week's time--till March 15--to confirm their ward's admission at the schools allotted to them.However, as not too many students had completed the admission process the date was postponed to March 18.
 
 Despite this, only 3,444 applicants confirmed their admission; 127 were rejected as they provided faulty documents. The remaining did not show up. Meanwhile, education officers are baffled at receiving such a poor response. ``The quota is reserved for children from the weaker section whose parents. The very fact that they didn't complete the final step, which was taking admission, has left us confused,â€œ said Meena Yadav, district ZP education officer (primary).
 
 Some officials are speculating that parents may be hoping that their wards may get into a better school in the next list and may have defaulted on this one. The round will be on March 27.
