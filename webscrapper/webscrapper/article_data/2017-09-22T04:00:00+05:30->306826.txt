 The girl said that her mother used to go to Patel’s house to do household work, and in her absence she would go there as domestic help. One-and-a-half years ago, when she and the accused were alone at home, Patel brandished a pistol and raped her at gunpoint. 
 
 After this, he repeatedly raped the girl and even threatened to kill her family if she did not give in to his demands. He would take the victim to several places and rape her at gun or knifepoint. The minor had been suffering the ordeal for the past one-and-a-half years and had sunk into depression. 
 
 ““On seeing her condition, the girl's mother got suspicious and quizzed her. Then, the girl broke down. Following this, her mother took the girl to police station and lodged a complaint against Patel whom we arrested soon after lodging the complaint,” said Jetpur police station sub-inspector N H Chawda, adding that the girl had been sent for medical examination.
