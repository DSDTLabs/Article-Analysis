MEERUT: Over a week after 21-year-old   got   for being the first girl from her village Chandora in Meerut to have completed Class XII,   winner   invited her to Delhi for a meeting. Khan, who got motivated to complete her Class XII after being chosen as the head of the Bal Panchayat in 2005 - which was conducted by   - has had a meeting with Kailash Satyarthi earlier too. 

  Speaking with TOI, an ecstatic Khan, said, "Soon after I got awarded with the Rani Laxmi Bai Award, Kailash sir called me up to congratulate. Not just him, even his wife congratulated me. He asked me to come to Delhi and I along with my brother Ali went to see him at Mukti Ashram in Delhi." 
 
  "Kailash sir also asked me to bring 'sarso da saag' and 'makke di roti' - his favourite food, which he had eaten once when he visited our family in Chandora," Khan said. 
 
  Girls in the Rajput-dominated village of Chandora are relegated to a menial work at Meerut's ubiquitous sports goods units wherein they are made to stitch footballs. The working age for girls in this village is as low as seven years. But, Zainab was an exception. Putting her child labour past firmly behind her, she decided to pursue her education beyond the boundaries of her village, defying society. 
 
  Satyarthi had even tweeted a day after Zainab was conferred with the award from his Twitter handle @k_satyarthi, "My daughter Zainab has made me very proud. From being a child labourer stitching footballs to Rani Laxmibai awardee." "It is a matter of great pride that a person of his stature invited me to have lunch with him. He has even promised to come down to Meerut very soon," Khan said.
