PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A dozen municipal schools in Pimpri Chinchwad will have   soon, under a pilot project sanctioned by the civic body. 

 The   (ECA), with permission from the  , will implement the project using a private company’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds. 
 
 “The growing population of the city needs water to satisfy its daily needs but the amount we receive from the dams is limited. As a result, people are digging borewells for non-drinking water. But the groundwater is limited and will deplete at an alarming rate if this continues to happen. So there is a need to recharge groundwater levels,” said ECA president Vikas Patil.
 
 “We want to create public awareness among the residents of the city about rainwater harvesting,” he said, on the idea behind the project. 
 
 Speaking about why they restricted the project to just 12 out of the 82-88 municipal schools in the city, Patil said: “Monsoon begins in mid-June, which is just three months away. We need to complete the preparations for this project by then so that we can use rainwater efficiently to recharge groundwater levels, and prevent it from draining into the rivers.”
 
 “The total cost of the project is around Rs12 lakh. Once we show the company how the funds have been utilized, we expect more funds so we can take this to more municipal schools in the city,” Patil said. 
 
 Work will officially begin on Friday at a municipal school in Wakad.
