A perfect vacation in   turned into a lurid experience for  . The actress was taking a beginners’ course in   in the European country, but ended up with a ligament tear because of a mix-up in communication.

 Saumya, who is back in the city, recalls, “My instructor spoke very little   while I understood little German. We managed fine during the initial classes as he demonstrated the basic steps. In fact, I had made good progress and both were happy. However, it was in the baby slope that the instructions were lost in translation. I was doing my first solo run and I heard my instructor shout ‘fast’. So, I skied faster, but turns out, he meant the German ‘fast’, which means ‘nearly done’. He was trying to boost my confidence, but I was already skiing at a fast pace and couldn’t control the speed. While trying to stop the slide, I fell with my knees collapsing inwards. I suffered a grade one tear and had a swollen knee.”
