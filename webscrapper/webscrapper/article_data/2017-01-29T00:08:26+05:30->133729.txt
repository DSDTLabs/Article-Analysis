MUMBAI: Four and a half years after voters cast their votes for Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation ( ) polls, a 65-year-old homemaker was declared the winner on Friday. Independent candidate  , who has six months on the job— the next civic polls are due in August—was stunned with the win, her first, and it took coaxing to make her raise the victory sign. 

 The sealed ballot box of the August 12, 2012, civic polls of   Number 18A was opened on Friday and Patil was declared the winner with 2,846 votes. She defeated her rival independent candidate, Tejal Parmar, who got 1,813 votes. Patil is the mother of MBMC’s NCP corporator Dhruvkishore. She will earn an ex gratia payment of Rs 7,500 a month.
 
 Patil had filed her nomination from the ward reserved for OBC women. Rita Shah of the BJP had also filed her candidature from Ward 18A. Her nomination form was rejected on the ground that she did not hold a valid caste certificate. 
 
 The Supreme Court granted relief to Shah by directing the returning officer for Ward 18A to retain Shah’s name as a BJP   in the August 12  .
 
 The SC had then said the results of that ward should not be declared till the final order was passed in her appeal against a Bombay high court order. Shah had moved the HC, which rejected her writ on the ground that she could file an election petition later. On January 10, the SC ordered that the results be declared. “My son has been doing a good job in the ward. I too want to make a difference,” said Patil whose health had deteriorated in the past three years. “My mother suffered a paralytic stroke and was in hospital till recently. The win has given her new hope and she wants to learn about the functioning of the municipality,” said Dhruvkishore.
