NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday submitted its memorial (written pleadings) to the   (ICJ) in the   case involving, as the government said, egregious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, 1963, by Pakistan. 

 "This is in furtherance of our application filed before the court on May 8, 2017," it said in a statement.
 
 The ICJ had suspended Jadhavâ€™s death sentence pending final its judgment after India moved the court in May, requesting immediate suspension of the sentence handed out by a Pakistani military court.
 
 On May 8, India moved the ICJ for instituting proceedings against Pakistan for violations of the Vienna Convention "in the matter of the detention and trial of an Indian national, Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav", and requested immediate suspension of the death sentence.
 
 After discussing with both India and Pakistan, ICJ president   asked India to make its submission by September 13. He asked   to make its counter-submission by December 13 before the UN court started hearing the matter.
 
 "At a meeting held by the president of the court with the agents of the parties on 8 June, 2017... the agent of India requested that each party be granted a period of four months for the preparation of its pleading; and whereas the agent of Pakistan indicated that periods of two months would be sufficient," the ICJ said.
