PATNA: The Bankipore   near   looks forsaken even though the state transport department got it renovated during 2011-13. A number of chairs in the small passenger waiting area are damaged, forcing passengers to sit on the floor. The electric fans are either not operational or their blades are missing.

 Sources said nearly 10% of the buses from   depot operate in the night, but there is no CCTV camera installed on the premises to ensure passengers’ safety. Moreover, three damaged buses serve as a partition between the waiting area and the workshop of the depot. Bus operators said the buses have been parked at the same place for the past 3-4 years.
 
 When asked about it, a   (BSRTC) official said the buses were to be auctioned. “We will soon fence the area so that no passenger could wander into the workshop area,” he said. 
 
 When contacted, transport department’s secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said all inter-state and inter-district buses operating from Bankipore depot would be shifted to the upcoming Inter-state bus terminal (ISBT) on   road once it starts functioning. “The ISBT will most probably start functioning within a year. Once completed, it will be the main bus terminal and   will be used as the stand for nearly 250 city buses,” Agarwal said.
 
 The ISBT is being developed on a 26-acre plot at Bairiya village at an estimated cost of Rs331.61 crore. Its foundation stone was laid by CM Nitish Kumar in December 2016. Nearly 3,000 buses would operate from the new bus terminal per day.
