NEW DELHI: The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) said on Thursday that it could still send the entries of either of the two –   and Gaurav Kumar – to the organisers of the Gold Coast   if the   Federation of India (GFI) wishes so.

 
 
 
 Reacting to TOI’s report on Wednesday in which it was highlighted that the names of Bobby and Gaurav were ignored for CWG selection since they didn’t possess a valid FIG licence, a top IOA functionary said that since it’s their prerogative to send the Indian contingent to the CWG as the ‘National Olympics Committee’ (NOC), they can always help the gymnasts out.
 
 
 
 “But we can’t do much on our own since the IOA only acts as a post office between the sports federations and the organisers. We all know that this licence issue can be sorted out in just a day by the GFI,” the official said.
 
 “We received a letter from the gymnastics’ international body (FIG) stating not to interfere in the selection matters, so we didn’t. Our selection committee had originally named Bobby, Gaurav along with Ashish in the men’s squad. But the GFI replaced their names with Patra and Yogeshwar, citing the licence issue. We couldn’t have done much and sent their names to the organisers. Now, it all depends on the GFI whether they are really interested in sending the deserving candidates who topped the trials,” the official added.
 
 The IOA has already sent a 222-member list of Indian contingent, including the names of gymnasts, to the CWG organisers. March 7 was the cut-off date to do so. But it can always get the names of athletes replaced under special circumstances or in case of injury to a travelling participant.
