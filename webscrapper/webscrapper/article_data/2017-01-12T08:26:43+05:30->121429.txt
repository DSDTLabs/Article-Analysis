PANAJI: Goa chief minister   was all praise for Portugal’s role in establishment of   in Goa, the only state in India to have it. Calling the uniform civil code a “gift” of the Portuguese, Parsekar said he was proud that a Goan-origin person was the head of Portugal.

 “Common civil code is only practised in Goa and appreciated by the other states,” Parsekar said after his early morning formal interaction with Portuguese Prime Minister  .
 
 Costa, who has roots in Goa, is on a three-day official visit to the state and had a formal interaction with Parsekar at the consul general of Portugal Rui Carvalho Baceira’s residence at Altinho, Panaji.
 
 Goa is the only state in India with a Uniform Civil Code which applies to Hindus, Muslims, Christians and other religions with regard to marriage, divorce and succession. When Goa attained liberation from Portugal in 1961, all Indian laws were extended to the state, except family laws that fall under the Portuguese Civil Code. Parliament authorized the   of 1867 to continue to apply to Goa.
 
 Article 44 of the directive principles in India sets its implementation as duty of the state and as the clamour for a Uniform Civil Code grew, the law commission of India sought suggestions on the Uniform Civil Code in October 2016.
 
 In his 45-minute deliberations, Parsekar touched upon Goa’s nearly 500-year old ties with Portugal, an erstwhile colonial power.
 
 “We have age-old ties with Portugal, our ties span almost 500 years and since the last 55 years after liberation, we have been doing well,” Parsekar said.
