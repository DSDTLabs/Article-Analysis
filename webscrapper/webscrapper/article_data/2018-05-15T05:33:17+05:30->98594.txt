AHMEDABAD: Ahmedabad police commissioner,  , on Monday, was highly critical of the traffic sense of the citizens in the city. He was speaking at the launch ceremony of an anti-pollution mask. Hitting out at the traffic sensibility of  , he said, “We are collectively colour blind to not be able to see the signal turning read and just rush through. It is sad that an automated traffic signal needs to be manned by a group of six police personnel.”

 “How callous and careless we are that a pedestrian does not even have the right to walk on the road. This reflects serious lack of civic sense in the citizens,” said Singh.
 
 He also said that the police force is willing to change this culture and bring traffic discipline. “A host of game changing aspects are being introduced in the traffic management system. We have equipped some 130 junctions across the city with cameras and using photo-enforcement technology, we will ensure that those who violate the rules will burn a hole in their pockets with the hefty e-challans being issued to them,” said the commissioner of police. 
 
 “Some 1,000 police constables have been freshly recruited and with technology and support, we can change this culture of traffic indiscipline,” said Singh.
 
 “This change will come from pressure, proper enforcement and fear of breaking the law and it will come. Our young constables will be the ambassadors of this change,” he added.
