PUNE: Three persons —  , a 24-year-old   on record, his   Ballu (29) and his mother Chanda Kaur (50) — sustained injuries after eight men attacked them with sharp weapons over a previous dispute. One of the attackers had allegedly even fired a pistol in the air.

 Ujalasingh has lodged an FIR against the eight suspects, some of whom have criminal records, at the Wanowrie police station.

 On March 11, two four-wheelers were set on fire at Tulja Bhavani Vasahat near Gadital in Hadapsar at around 1.30 am on Sunday. At that time, 45-year-old Ajmersingh Tak, one of Ujalasingh’s relatives, had lodged a complaint with the Hadapsar police. 
 
 Ajmersingh runs a welding unit in Tulja Bhavani Vasahat. The suspects had poured petrol on his multi-utility vehicle and his brother’s sedan, both of which were parked along the road, before setting them on fire. The fire had reportedly caused damages worth Rs 2 lakh.
 
 An official from the Wanowrie police said one of the suspects learned that Ujalasingh Tak would be holding them responsible for torching the vehicles. 
 
 The suspect and his accomplices, armed with sharp weapons and pistol, then barged into Ujalasingh’s residence and attacked him. They also and beat up his brother and mother for intervening in the dispute. They also threatened Ujalasingh with dire consequences before leaving.
 
 The two groups have been involved in a long-running dispute and this   is only the latest in a series of skirmishes. The police have booked the suspects under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act.
