NAGPUR: Recently, blood was transfused in a patient and he became unconscious in 5 minutes. The transfusion had to be stopped immediately. Later, it was learnt that the blood was brought to the hospital in cold state and the nurse had kept it in sunlight to warm it, said, Dr Ravi Wankhede, secretary of Zonal Transplant Co-ordination Committee.

 “Blood which is used as medicine to treat could be dangerous if it is not used rationally. Hence, I keep on stressing that just like doctors, nurses and attendants need to learn about safe use of blood,” he added.
 
 Wankhede was speaking at ‘TransMeet 17’ a workshop on ‘Good blood banking practices’ jointly organized by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Nagpur Federation of Blood Bank at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). 
 
 GMCH dean Dr Abhimanyu Niswade was the chief guest, FDA Joint Commissioner   was the guest of honour. Dr Harish Warbha, from the federation and   (SBTC), former deputy director Dr Sanjay Jadhav were also present on the dais.
 
 In a case of traffic accident, the patient had lost excessive blood. If right blood was not transfused in time, he would have lost his life. The hospital placed the demand of RH positive blood (suitable for patient) to a blood bank. In a few minutes, the blood bank sent the blood, but it was unlabelled, Dr Sunil Rajadhyaksha, transfusion medicine department head at Tata Memorial Hospital (Mumbai) said.
 
 “It delayed the process. We had to wait for the blood bank to resend the same blood in labelled form. As per law, the unlabelled blood is unreliable. Its mandatory to put write blood type on the label,” he added.
 
 As many as 200 doctors and lab technicians from across Vidarbha, Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh participated in the third edition of the workshop.  , who organized the workshop said, “For the first time the technicians will be given hands on training on safe blood transfusion on Saturday, the second day of the workshop.”
