NEW DELHI: A 23-year-old man was   to death in central Delhi’s   on Monday morning. Police have detained two persons and suspect the murder to be a fallout of a past rivalry.

  A passerby noticed a man lying in a pool of blood and informed the police. The victim, Varun, a resident of east Delhi’s  , had suffered multiple stab wounds. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead.
 
 Varun’s family members informed cops that they had last spoken to him two hours before they got a call regarding his death. “He had said that he was with his friends,” said a family member.
 
 The victim’s wallet and phone were found intact, so the possibility of a robbery attempt that went wrong has been ruled out. Cops are, however, probing whether Varun was carrying something else with him at the time of the incident.
