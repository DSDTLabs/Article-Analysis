AHMEDABAD: A major controversy has erupted in the recruitment of firemen in the   ( ) with allegations of altering recruitment rules in the last minute. 

 In 2015 a total of 188 firemen were recruited, with an   course or a six-month fireman’s course being mandatory for candidates. But instead of selecting qualified candidates, allegations are now being made that only class X and class XII passed students were considered. 
 
 People have alleged that objections and suggestions prior to changing the recruitment rules were not heard. Senior officials in the vigilance department claim that till date they have not received any official complaints or representations regarding the fireman recruitment issue. 
 
 “We have sought a clarification from the fire department on the issue. We will even hear the aggrieved party as well,” says a senior   official. 
 
 The allegations were that even though the AFES had announced through newspaper advertisements that they seek objections to change of recruitment rules in April 2015, but in September that year the department went ahead with the recruitment without a hearing. A three-year fixed pay term was set by the AFES with the approval of the standing committee.
