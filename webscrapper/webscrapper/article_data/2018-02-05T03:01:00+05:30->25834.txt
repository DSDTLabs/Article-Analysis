Margao: The crumbling Camara Municipal de Salcete building built in 1778 at Margao’s Old Market could be the new proposed Fatorda municipal council (FMC) building. Archives and Archaeology minister Vijai Sardesai announced plans to restore this prestigious edifice to its original glory. Sardesai said that funds were available with the government to undertake the exercise with the Town and Country Planning (TCP) department’s conservation committee deliberating this matter.  Sardesai said, “The beautification project of the Old Market precinct will be linked to the Camara Municipal de Salcete that the government will try to acquire from the present owners who have certain apprehensions that it will be commercialised. Historian Prajal Sakhadande has already written to the archives department seeking that it be given the status of a heritage building. The request has been processed and once the status is accorded, it will have to be conserved by it’s owner. I am in constant contact with the owners since we need to buy this land from the landlord as we require the ownership of the building.”
