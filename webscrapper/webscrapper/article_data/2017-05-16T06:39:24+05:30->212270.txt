NEW DELHI: Congress and other key opposition players took a cautious approach to Bihar chief minister  's suggestion that the   government should announce a second term for President  .

 Congress refused to react to Kumar's proposal for an encore for Mukherjee. "That is for the government to decide,"   spokesperson, Shobha Oza, said. She said a united opposition was holding discussions for a consensus candidate which would be named in due course.
 
 The Left also took a guarded stance.   leader   said, "We are certain President Mukherjee will not agree to a second term in office unless there is absolute consensus over his name. For that to happen, the government will have to move such a proposal. We cannot comment on this until the government makes a move first."
 
 Karat, however, said the Left had held consultative meetings with other political parties in a bid to arrive at a name that was "acceptable to the largest numbers". Individual discussions between the CPM, CPI, DMK, JD(U) and   have already been held, and former West Bengal governor, Gopal Krishna Gandhi, is among the names that have emerged as contenders for the country's highest office. Sources said a final decision was likely by May-end.
