New Delhi: With an average footfall of 70,000 a day, New Delhi is not only one of the busy   stations in the   network but also unique in its own way. Unlike other stations, New Delhi caters to passengers who are largely first-time Metro users and DMRC has put in place   to help those people and manage the  .

 Located next to the   and connected to the Airport Express Line, it gets both flight and train passengers, many of whom are first-time visitors to the city. They don’t use smart cards and are unaware about the Metro system, leading to chaos and crowding at the station. To solve this problem, DMRC has recently made some arrangements.
 
 According to the new plan, there will be counters for different fare slabs. “There are six slabs of Metro fares—Rs 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 and 50. For faster clearance, we have made more counters for tokens of Rs 20, 30 and 40 since most people travel under these slabs,” a DMRC spokesperson said. “We have three extra counters for tokens of all denominations, apart from token vending machines.” 
 
 DMRC said that information boards with fare charts have been put at various points for the convenience of passengers. It has also deployed guards with megaphones to make announcements and guide first-time Metro users. 
 
 The two gates leading towards the railway station have been made exit-only gates. “Earlier, the queue at the security point often clashed with the ticketing queue and hence the CISF frisking point has been shifted to gate numbers 5 and 6 of the Airport Line, which are being used as common entry points for passengers of Airport Line and Yellow Line,” the spokesperson said.
 
 Now, the Airport Line passengers, who want to go to Yellow Line, have a clear passage and no additional frisking is now required for them. “Three additional automatic fare collection exit gates have been installed on south side to facilitate exit for Airport Line passengers coming through Yellow Line,” the spokesperson said.
