There is nothing wrong with the network,”   deputy managing director and chief information officer Mrutunjay Mahapatra told ToI on Tuesday morning.
 
 The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) on Monday had said that it had not received any formal report of cyber attack on Indian networks by WannaCry.
