 Ashish Bhatia, the managing director of GPHC, told mediaperson on Friday that they had received an application from  , the owner of M/s SN BuildCon, a private contractor, against GPHC officials. "The contractor was roped in for construction of two GPHC projects - the women's police station (east) in Ahmedabad at Shahibaug and a Home Guards barrack extension at Madhavnagar in Sanand.
