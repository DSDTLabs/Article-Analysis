KOLKATA: Father   the only person   entertained in the reclusive life he otherwise led at the apartment complex in Watgunge. It was Father Rodney who rushed to De's flat on Tuesday after he was alerted by his caregiver. 

 Father Rodney, along with nuns from the  , had visited Partha first on June 17, 2015, at the  . The priest had then remarked that Partha, despite hailing from a rich family, was a man who represented the poorest of poor. "We don't mean that he is poor materially. But he is the poorest of poor as there is nobody standing by him. He is misunderstood, ridiculed, made fun of and left with no personal space. We felt there had to be someone beside him for him to be understood. Jesus would have stood by a person like him," he had remarked.
 
 True to his words, Father Rodney had continued to stand by Partha even after he was discharged from the hospital. According to Partha's new neighbours, Father Rodney would drop by Partha's flat at least once a week, perhaps giving him company and counselling him. 
 
 When Partha's charred body was taken away on Tuesday, a visibly dazed Father Rodney took the stairs instead of the elevator and walked all the way down from the 11th floor apartment. "I cannot say anything now. Please give me some time to recover," said Father Rodney who had become Partha's friend and is perhaps the only person who had an insight into the workings of his mind. Yet, even he could not have predicted the death.
