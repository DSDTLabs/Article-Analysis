PUNE: Bharatiya Janata Party   Medha Kulkarni has come down heavily on the “irrational” self-assessment report by the Savitribai Phule  . 

 Alleging that the report submitted by SPPU to the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) was ‘irrational’ and full of errors, Kulkarni wondered how the NAAC awarded the varsity an ‘A’ grade based on such a report.
 
 “For instance, the information provided on number of professors — full-time, associate and assistant — was 241 in Part ‘B’ of the report, on page 41. But while providing the break-up of the staff’s qualification, the same number increased to 261. We are surprised how the assessment body ignored these discrepancies,” she said.
 
 Every educational institution is required to prepare a self-assessment report and publish it online. Accordingly, with the NAAC committee slated to visit the varsity on January 23, the SPPU has published a report. 
 
 Kulkarni, who wrote to the NAAC on December 26 last year, also raised the issue of the insufficient number of PhD guides and professors in various departments of the SPPU, and the unavailability of vice-chancellor W N Gade’s educational qualifications. 
 
 “I have stated (to NAAC) that SPPU has violated rules and regulations, and action needs to be taken against the university officials.”
 
 Vice-chancellor Gade, however, said the MLA might have been hasty in drawing her conclusions. “The MLA got her information from the wrong documents. We keep updating the report while submitting information to the NAAC committee. It’s a process that takes place over 6-7 months. Before making (such) allegations, I would like the people’s representatives to first confirm the information with us. As per my knowledge the information is 100 % true and there are no discrepancies in the report,” Gade told TOI.
