SANTA FE: Hours after a gunman went on a shooting spree in a Houstan school, killing at least 10 students and injuring several others, US president Donald Trump, who has previously shied away from gun control measures in favour of arming teachers, said his administration was “determined to do everything in our power to protect our students, secure our schools, and to keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves, and to others”.

 Aerial footage showed students standing in a grassy field and three medical helicopters landing at the school in Santa Fe, a city of about 13,000 residents roughly 48km southeast of Houston. School officials said law enforcement officers were working to secure the building and move students to another location. Students were being transported to another location to reunite with their parents.
 
 The school district cleared the students from the campus, with television footage showing them leaving in a single file. No other schools had been affected.
 
 Student Paige Curry told local media that she heard gunshots and then a fire alarm. “I saw some girl — she had, you know, she got shot in the kneecap, I guess. So she had a bandage around it. She was limping and then the firemen came and got her,” another student, who gave his first name as Tyler, told CBS.
 
 In the aftermath of the February 14 attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, survivors pulled all-nighters, petitioned city councils and state lawmakers, and organized protests in a grass-roots movement.
