Vijayawada: Making it clear that the Jana Sena Party (JSP) will once again stay away from the all-party meet called by the state government on Special Category Status (SCS), the JSP chief   termed the meeting as an empty political engagement without any constructive approach.

 Speaking to reporters on Friday after the padayatra along with CPI and CPM leaders, Pawan Kalyan said that they have lost faith in the state government with many flip-flops and contradicting statements over the issue. However, he put a rider on his decision by saying that the government should come up with a road map and the ministers should reach out to various political parties for discussion. 
 
 The JSP chief takes claim over the idea of no-confidence motion against the NDA-lead government and the political tremors that it created. He said the idea of no-confidence motion was evolved in the Joint Fact Finding Committee (JFFC). Earlier during the day, JSP chief Pawan Kalyan hit the road for the first time over the issue of SCS by conducting padayatra along with left parties in Vijayawada from Benz Circle to Ramavarappadu. The supporters of CPM, CPI and JSP parties attended the padayatra in huge numbers. The next protest will be held in Anantapur on April 15. Continuing his attack on the incumbent Telugu Desam Party (TDP), he said the state government has put the people in confusion over the SCS with contradicting statements. Jana Sena chief did not spare the opposition YSR Congress and said the main opposition has also failed to take the fight for SCS in right direction. The Left parties have also announced that they are not going to attend the all party. CPI state secretary K Ramakrishna also said that the all party meeting is an attempt to gain publicity and we are not going to become a party to that attempt.
