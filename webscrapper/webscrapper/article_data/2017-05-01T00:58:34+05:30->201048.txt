MUMBAI: Even as Eman Ahmed’s transfer plans to   are being fine-tuned, the 36-year-old   who was formerly considered the world's heaviest woman at roughly 500kg spent what could be her last Sunday in Mumbai uneventfully. 

 Dr Muffazal Lakdawala, who operated on Eman on March 7, tweeted, “We will miss Eman. May God Bless her to a super life ahead (stet).” Eman weighed 176kg last week and is on liquid feeds through a feeding tube. “Eman is fine. Doctors have seen her on Sunday as usual,” said Dr Aparna Govil Bhasker, who is a part of the 13-member team that treated on Eman since her arrival on February 13.   has spent around Rs 3 crore on her so far, said hospital authorities.
 
 On Sunday, Eman’s sister   told TOI, “All is well now.” She added that she would have the definite travel plans by Monday.
 
 It has been a week since Shaimaa leveled charges against Saifee Hospital and the medical team treating Eman. While she wanted the hospital to keep Eman till she can walk again, the hospital was ready to discharge her; the medical team has maintained that Eman’s legs are too deformed for her to be able to walk again, if at all.
 
 An official of the VPS Healthcare group, which has promised to transport and take care of Eman in its Bhurjeel Hospital in Abu Dhabi for a year, said, “Eman will soon leave for Abu Dhabi.” It has been learnt that the group is in the process of finalizing an aircraft to transfer Eman. Though the group wanted to move her on Sunday itself, holidays in UAE and India have delayed the arrival of permits.
