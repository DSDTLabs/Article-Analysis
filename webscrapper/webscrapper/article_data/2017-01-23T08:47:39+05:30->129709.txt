 “We were asleep when our dog Rocky came up to us late on Saturday night and began making muffled noise. My son understood that something was wrong so we all got up immediately. We looked out of the window and saw four burglars trying to break in the house of neighbour Vasudev Bilandani,” said 50-year-old Jayesh Patel, a resident of Sanidhya Duplex. 
 
 Jayesh and his son immediately informed the neighbours who rushed out of their homes. Hearing the commotion, the burglars took off but the local residents followed them. “We caught hold of one of them but the other three began pelting stones at us. Apart from me, my son Mehul and a neighbour Shailesh Patel suffered injuries,” Jayesh said.
 
 He added that in last seven months, burglars have targeted their society four times. “Last year, some burglars had tried to enter my house too but our dog Rocky alerted us and they fled,” Jayesh said. 
 
 Manjalpur police inspector, R S Patel said that the other three who fled from the spot too have been identified. “The trio identified as Karsan Vahoniya, Sunil Vahoniya and Kanji Damor are all residents of Dahod. We will arrest them soon.” The police said that it keeps patrolling in the area but the colony is close to the railway tracks where dense bushes have grown. 
 
 “It makes difficult to spot the burglars who often hide in the bushes. Our motorbike night patrolling, though, has helped in bringing down the burglaries,” Patel said.
