AGARTALA: Projecting   as CM nominee for the fifth consecutive time, the Left Front on Tuesday announced the names of its candidates for the coming assembly election in Tripura. However, five sitting MLAs were not given tickets to contest polls. 

 Newly nominated convener of the Left Front and CPM state secretary, Bijan Dhar said it was unanimously resolved to give 57 seats to CPM and one each to CPI, Forward Bloc and Revolutionary   (RSP). In the last election, CPI and RSP had contested in two seats each and Forward Bloc fielded one candidate. This time, both CPI and RSP lost one seat each.
 
 While CPI has selected jail minister   to contest from the Shantirbazar constituency (reserved for tribals) , both Forward Bloc and RSP changed their candidates considering the winnability prospects. Forward Bloc nominated mayor in-council of Agartala Municipal Corporation Biswanath Saha from Bordowali seat (central Agartala) and RSP has selected Sukanta Datta from Radhakishorepur constituency (Udaipur).
