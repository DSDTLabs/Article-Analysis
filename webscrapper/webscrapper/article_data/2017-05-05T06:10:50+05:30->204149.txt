CHENNAI: The   Sand   Association (TSLOA) has sought chief minister   to fill the vacancy of the chairman of the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA). 

 The chairman could resolve the sand crisis created in the wake of close of sand quarries,   R Munirathinam said in a statement here.
 
 The association has also threatened to take up the issue with the governor, if their grievances are not redressed.
 
 Pointing out that the new permits for sand quarries could be issued by district collectors after the inspection of SEIAA chairman, he said, "The chief minister should take steps on a war footing in this regard." 
 
 He said around 15 lakh construction works and one lakh   had been affected by the closure of 38 sand quarries across the state. 
 
 He said carrying out manual operations in sand quarries would cause delay in loading sand to trucks, wherein the everyday demand for key construction material cannot be met.
