CHANDIGARH: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday condemned the massive damage to the aquatic life and environment due to discharge of molasses into the Beas river allegedly by   and Industries Private Limited in Gurdaspur, in which daughter of former Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president   is one of the directors. The party has demanded a judicial probe into the entire incident.

 Harvinder is brother of Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh’s religious adviser Paramjit Singh Sarna. SAD secretary general and MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa said the callous attitude of the sugar mill owners had played havoc with the aquatic life in Punjab, leaving hundreds of fish dead.
 
 He said the incident had pushed some endangered species like Indus dolphins towards extinction. “As the owner of the mill have links with the higher-ups in the ruling dispensation, Paramjit Singh Sarna’s company was constantly defying the rules prescribed for the industry as well as brazenly flouting the pollution control norms which led to this tragedy,” he added.
 
 On Thursday, molasses discharged from a storage tank of the Chadha sugar mill located at   village in Gurdaspur into Kahnuwan drain further leading to the Beas river had resulted in killing of hundreds of fish.
 
 Dhindsa said since the sugar mill was owned by the family of the CM’s religious adviser, there is high probability that the accused could be let off with minor charges or rules could be bent to provide them an easy escape route. The SAD MP demanded a time-bound judicial inquiry against the accused and if found guilty, they must pay for the damage they have done to the environment.
