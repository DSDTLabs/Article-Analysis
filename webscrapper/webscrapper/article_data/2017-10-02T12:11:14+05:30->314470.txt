HYDERABAD: Senior   leader and former Union minister Bandaru Dattatreya on Sunday received sympathy from an unexpected quarter.   veteran leader V Hanumantha Rao said the   in Telangana felt hurt when Dattatreya was dropped from the cabinet. Even TRS Rajya Sabha member K Keshava Rao said he did not expect such a treatment for the veteran BJP leader. Praising the former Union minister, he said no post or portfolio was bigger than Dattatreya.

 The two leaders made these statements in the presence of Union minister of state for home affairs, Hansraj Gangaram Ahir and Union minister of state (independent charge) for labour and employment Santosh Kumar Gangwar, during ` Alai Balai', organised by Dattatreya at the Exhibition Grounds on Sunday. Chairman of Legislative Council K Swamy Goud, deputy chief minister Mahamood Ali, home minister N Narasimha Reddy and TJAC chairman Prof M Kodandaram were also present at the annual event.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Hanumantha Rao said a large number of BCs were unhappy over dropping of Dattatreya.
 
 “On one hand BJP wants to become an alternative to TRS, on the other it has distanced itself from BCs, who constitute 50 percent of the population in the state, by its decision. The BCs are angry. Though I am a Congress man I was also hurt by Prime Minister Modi's decision. I thought that Dattatreya would actually get a promotion since Modi is also from BC community. Morever, he has a clean image,“ said Hanumanth Rao.
 
 Responding to Congress leader's statement, Hansraj Gangaram Ahir said Dattatreya would be given a suitable post.
 
 Dattatreya said ` Alai Balai' programme was to bring people of all sections on one platform. “I want to see a vibrant Telangana because a vibrant Telangana would lead to a vibrant India. I want to see Telangana state number one," said Dattatreya.
