Mobile phones operate on micro wave signals, so... bad idea to keep one in your pants pocket?

 Men intent on preserving their manhood have been splurging on under wear that promises to shield their genitals from radiation. Sellers claim that their underwear protects testicles from the harmful effects of radio waves emitted by cellphones, and so helps maintain a robust sperm count and high  . But do male   users really risk infertility?
 
 The myth has been around a long time. During World War II some enlisted men would consistently volunteer for radar duty just prior to their scheduled leave days in the hope that exposure to radio waves would produce temporary sterility . So, the military asked Hermann Muller--a geneticist who won the Nobel Prize for showing that   could cause sterility and genetic mutations- to evaluate the effects of radio waves. Muller could not find any dose of radio waves that produced either sterility or genetic mutations, and concluded that radio waves did not present the same threat to fertility that X-rays did.
 
 And that's because X-rays, which have very short wavelengths, carry much more energy than radio waves, which have relatively longer wavelengths. If you are still concerned about phone signals affecting your fertility, why not just carry your cellphone in your shirt pocket rather than your pants?
