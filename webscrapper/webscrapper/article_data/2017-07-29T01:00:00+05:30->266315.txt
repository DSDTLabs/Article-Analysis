When you have a film title  , one would expect it to be a war film. But debutant director   says that this film is about the war between two hearts. Interestingly, the entire film will happen inside a car. “Though we have a heroine, she will appear only for a few minutes and rest will be shown like a telephonic conversation. The entire story is conveyed through a single character, which is the hero. The story revolves around their love story, the hurdles they face and how they sort it out. The narration starts in Chennai and ends in Bangalore, through a car journey. I wanted to try something new and interesting and I thought this works best,” says Senthil. 

 Jishnu Menon, who played a small role in Mani Ratnam’s Kaatru Veliyidai, plays the lead. Newbie Prerna is his love interest. “The music is composed by  . There will be two songs in the film, where both will have a bit of romance and fight,” he smiles. So, how did cinema happen? “I still work for an IT firm, but I have always been passionate about cinema. I directed six short films to gain some experience. I didn’t want to quit my job and work as an assistant director as I thought it will be too risky. So, I decided to make a feature film instead. The post-production work is over and we are planning for a September release,” he signs off.
