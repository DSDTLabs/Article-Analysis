Panaji/Poinguinim: Heavy rainfall of 166.4mm in just 72 hours, till Wednesday morning, and water logging in fields spell a threat to paddy crop in the flowering and harvesting stage, with possibility of reduction in paddy yield and rotting of the grain.

 “Ready crop can be affected when reclining on the ground as the paddy may germinate and/or the grain may decay,” scientist, ICAR, Old Goa, R Manohara said, adding that less rainfall and even draining of water a fortnight before harvest are ideal conditions for reaping paddy. 
 
 While areas of Salcete, like Colva, have already started harvesting, the process has been obstructed by winds.“Reclining crop makes the task difficult for harvesters,” Fr George Quadros, a promoter of agricultural mechanization, said. 
 
 Officials from the agriculture department said that the rain was beneficial for vegetable crops in upland area. “After a dry spell, the rainfall will be good for upland vegetable cultivation and chilly crop,” zonal agriculture officer, (ZAO), Canacona, Chandrahas Desai said.
 
 In Canacona, the pattern of rainfall will not cause much damage during the flowering stage, as here the rainfall is slow and moderate. “But heavy and continuous rain may adversely affect the pollination stage of the crops resulting in low yield and production,” Desai said.
 
 The flowering stage is a critical one, agricultural scientists said, adding that heavy rain during this period can produce an adverse effect on the crop’s pollination process. 
 
 Also, highly intense rain combined with strong winds can lead to flower drop and impact the grain formation stage, former subject matter specialist (agronomy), Indian council of agricultural research (ICAR), Old Goa, H R Prabhugaonkar said. 
 
 “Once the grain is formed there is no problem, but heavy rain during the milky stage or grain formation stage may cause reduction in yield,” Prabhugaonkar said.
