BHARUCH/SURAT: Chief minister   on Thursday paid a surprise visit at the site of new bridge near Golden Bridge on   on the old national highway.

 Rupani took the stock of the progress work from roads and building department officials. 
 
 “The bridge is expected to be operational by June 2018. This will provide a smooth ride to commuters between twin towns of   and Ankleshwar,” he said.
 
 Speaking on the much-needed weir-cum-causeway over Narmada near Bhadbhut, Rupani said that the budgetary allocation has already been made and the government is awaiting the clearance from Union ministry of environment and forests.
 
 The state government has received a number of representations to release more water from Sardar Sarovar dam into Narmada to stop the influx of sea water, which has resulted in severe salinity ingress in the borewells. “Discussions are on with the   to discharge more water. I am hopeful that some solution would emerge,” Rupani told media persons in Bharuch.
