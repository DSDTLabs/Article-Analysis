AHMEDABAD: A special   court on Saturday started hearing on the discharge application filed by retired cop   in the 2004 Ishrat   encounter case. 

 Amin dubbed the CBI probe in this case as "bogus", and claimed that IPS officer Satish Verma had manipulated evidence. Amin also submitted that a police inspector with the city crime branch, I K  's involvement was visible in the incident, but the investigators wrongly chose to make him a witness. He asserted that the shootout was genuine. tnn
