LUCKNOW:  , a resident of Delhi, who was on a business trip to Lucknow had to check over 10 ATMs on March 1 to find one with cash before boarding a train for Delhi. He was about to miss his train as his two hours got wasted in search for an   with cash. And Farooq was not alone.

 Poor planning by banks led to severe cash shortage as ATMs started running dry from Thursday night itself, spoiling the   who faced hardship.
 
 Though there are over 700 ATMs in the city, most ran out of cash owing to heavy withdrawals for Holi shopping and salaries. A leading bank that has over 350 ATMs in city, saw most of them running dry. The worst-hit areas were those with high footfalls like Hazratganj, Munshipulia, Gole Market and Lekhraj market.
 
 A senior bank official told TOI, “There was more than expected withdrawal before Holi which is why ATMs ran dry. There was increased demand due to coinciding of Holi and month-end. People took out large amounts either for shopping or as usual salary withdrawal. This led to emptying of ATMs.”
 
 ATMs of private sector banks also faced similar cash shortage.
 
 Karan, a local, was disappointed since he could not buy enough colours and sweets because he ran out of cash. “You cannot buy daily stuff through   or  . You need to have cash for buying sweets, colours and grocery. Banks should have planned refilling of ATMs at least thrice a day,” he said.
 
 An official of a private bank said that they generally fill ATMs to full capacity before holidays and festivals.
 
 
 
 
 He said, “ATMs in areas with high footfall get more cash. We fill 20-30% more than average cash demand at an ATM, but during festivals, the refill is at full capacity. There was more than expected withdrawal.”
 
 The reprieve was that banks were open on Saturday, so some of them made sure to refill their ATMs. “There was no cash supply from RBI for the past two days, so we couldn’t refill ATMs. The problem will be resolved by Saturday evening,” said an official.
