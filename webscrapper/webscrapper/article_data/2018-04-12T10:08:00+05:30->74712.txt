MALAPPURAM: The   ( ) has decided to re-consider the proposed realignments of NH-66, in areas where residents opposed the widening survey in Malappuram district. The decision was taken in a meeting of revenue officials and people's representatives, convened by PWD Minister G Sudhakaran at Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday. 

 MLA, Abid Hussain Thangal, said that NHAI has agreed to re-examine the proposed re-alignment of highway in the areas where the people pointed out faults. The authority will finalize the alignment only after comparing the estimated loss of properties and lands, in two proposals prepared in 2013 and 2017. The survey process in these areas would re-start only after a consensus is reached. Surveys in other parts of the district would go on as per schedule.
 
 But the NH action council has flayed the decision to compare the estimated loss of properties and land recorded during satellite surveys conducted in 2013 and 2017. Abullais Thenhipalam, convener of the action council, said that the decision will worsen the situation as it will create a divide among the land owners. He wanted the government to discuss the issue with representatives of action council instead of officials and MLAs.
 
 The action council staged a sit-in protest at Chelari on Wednesday. The survey for land acquisition and boundary demarcation of the NH 66 stretch from   to   in   will begin on Thursday. As per e-gazette notification, land in Thavanur, Kaladi, Eezhavathiruthi, Perumpadappu, Veliyankode and Ponnani Nagaram would be acquired.
