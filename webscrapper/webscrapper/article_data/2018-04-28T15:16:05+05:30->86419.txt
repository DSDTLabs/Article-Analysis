BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel’s advice to   on “How to get votes ...” has set off a series of sharp reactions from the Congress. 

 Mobile clip of her small informal session with party workers had gone viral on Friday night. 
 
 Lok-Laj sab chor kare hain, samvidhan par chot, Rajyapal bhi mang rahi hain, Modi ke liye vote—Congress spokesperson KK Mishra tweeted on Friday taking a dig on Anandiben Patel’s lesson to the party workers during her trip to Chitrakoot in Satna district. 
 
 Mishra accused Patel of misusing her constitutional post to gather votes for Modi and ruling BJP in poll-bound state.
 
 Similarly, Vivek Tankha, head of the Congress legal cell and Rajya Sabha member, tweeted - “Governor of MP holds a constitutional position. She cannot be seen in public working for a party. The video is sad commentary of Gov’s partisanship. The President of India must take notice of Gov s action,”
 
 Congress is also looking forward to take up this matter with the Rashtrapati Bhavan.
 
 "Votes aise nahi milenge.. Unke ghar pe jaake baithoge, haath pheraoge, tabhi votes milenge)," (votes won't come like that, go to villages, sit with them and show some care,” – Patel can be heard telling Satna mayor Mamta Pandey and other party workers in the viral video.
 
 "you will only get votes when you adopt needy and malnourished children …run a campaign, ask others to join...only then PM Narendra Modi’s dream for 2022 will be fulfilled…,” she said adding "you don’t need votes, but we do"
 
 Pandey nodded and said they have already adopted many kids from anganwadis.
