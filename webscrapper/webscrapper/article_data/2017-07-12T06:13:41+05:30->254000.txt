New Delhi: The Delhi   on Tuesday asked DU to furnish before it the list of candidates who have applied for a MPhil course in which a blind student could not appear due to the fault of Indian Railways.

 A bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice C Hari Shankar also sought to find out the whereabouts of the student, Vaibhav Shukla, whose plight was highlighted by TOI and taken cognizance by the court.
 
 After DU placed before it a copy of Shukla’s application for the MPhil (Sanskrit) course with a local contact address, the court attempted to establish contact with the student and also appointed senior advocate S K Rungta as amicus.
 
 Last week, TOI had reported how Shukla was unable to board the train as he couldn’t enter a locked disabled compartment and, as a result, missed his entrance examination at DU.
 
 HC had then questioned the railways over lack of facilities for the differently abled and asked it to explain why it was insensitive to plight of disabled in terms of ease of access and placement of coaches reserved for them.
 
 “The placement of the coaches for the disabled itself does not appear to be fair... The height of the coach from the ground by itself at such end points would be such that it would be daunting even for any person to board it. The inaccessibility of the railways as a mode of transport for the disabled would thus be unimaginable,” the court had observed. It then asked DU if it can consider conducting an examination for him to take a shot at securing admission.
