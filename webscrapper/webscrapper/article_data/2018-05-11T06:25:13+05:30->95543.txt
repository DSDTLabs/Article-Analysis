AHMEDABAD: In a setback to the former chairman of   in Mehsana,  , tje   high court on Thursday turned down his appeal against an order by the cooperatives registrar, to recover Rs 42 crore from him.

 This amount was the loss caused to the milk cooperative due to alleged irregularities when Chaudhary was its chairman. The order to inquire into the irregularities, fix Chaudhary’s liability and recover the sum from him was issued in last January, under section 93 of the Gujarat Co-operative Societies Act, 1961. In June 2016, the cooperative registrar had issued a show-cause notice to him in this regard.
 
 Chaudhary moved the high court, but a single-judge bench turned down his petition. He filed an appeal before a division bench, which has also refused him relief. The bench, however, stayed its order for a month so Chaudhary can move the Supreme Court.
 
 According to the registrar, a loss of Rs 41.83 crore was caused by three irregularities or misdeeds by Chaudhary as the chairman of Dudhsagar Dairy. 
 
 A loss of Rs 22.50 crore was caused by providing 13,731 metric tonnes of cattle feed to the state of Maharashtra during a drought. 
 
 Some 21.57 lakh kg of cattle feed was found to be missing on September 15, 2015. This was either not bought at all — its price being Rs 2.06 crore — or was siphoned off. 
 
 The dairy bought sugar between April 2012 and January 2014 without following proper approval at higher-than-market rates, causing a loss of Rs 17.26 crore.
 
 The inquiry into the sending of cattle feed to Maharashtra revealed that Chaudhary was liable for the decision. Inquiries into the two other decisions will begin as the HC had earlier stayed them. Chaudhary was removed from the post of chairman by a court order. He was also barred from contesting elections for six years by the registrar, but the SC struck down that order.
