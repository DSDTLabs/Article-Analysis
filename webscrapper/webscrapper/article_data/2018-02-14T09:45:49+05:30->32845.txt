NEW DELHI: Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist   on Tuesday expressed concern over  's proposed cuts to foreign aid and his 'America First' worldview.

 
 "It's not that the United States shouldn't look out for its people. The question is how best to do that. My view is that engaging with the world has proven over time to benefit everyone, including Americans, more than withdrawing does," he said in his 10th annual letter with wife Melinda.
 
 In his answer to the question 'How are President Trump's policies affecting your foundation's work,' Gates also spoke about how American foreign aid has been instrumental in fighting disease and poverty around the world. He explained that these efforts achieve the twin aims of generating employment for Americans and also securing their lives.
 
 "These efforts save lives. They also create  . And they make Americans more secure by making poor countries more stable and stopping disease outbreaks before they become pandemics. The world is not a safer place when more people are sick or hungry," he wrote.
 
 Though Gates admitted that we "disagree with this administration more than the others we've met with," he reiterated the need to "work together whenever possible."
 
 Melinda, however, was more scathing in her criticism of President Trump himself.
 
 "I wish our president would treat people, and especially women, with more respect when he speaks and tweets. Equality is an important national principle," she wrote.
 
 She urged Trump to "set a good example" for his fellow Americans.
 
 Controversy had erupted during Trump's election campaign when a leaked video showed him bragging about groping women.
 
 Earlier this year, the US President found himself battling another controversy when he allegedly referred to African countries and Haiti as "sh***ole" countries.
