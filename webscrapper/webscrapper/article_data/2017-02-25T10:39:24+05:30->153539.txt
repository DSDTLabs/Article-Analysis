TRICHY: N M Natarajan, the estranged husband of AIADMK general secretary  , on Friday seemed to hold out an olive branch to the rebels led by O Panneerselvam by urging them to come back to the party fold. He alleged that there was a conspiracy by a section of people to block the twin leaf symbol of the party.

 Deputy general secretary   had also made a similar claim while assuming charge on Thursday saying that those who drifted away from the party would be welcomed with a motherly heart. 
 
 Addressing a meeting at Thanjavur in connection with the birth anniversary of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, Natarajan said that he had strived hard to reclaim the party symbol when attempts were made to block it following the death of former chief minister  . “So along as the popularity of   remains, no one can harm the party or it symbol,” he said .
 
 Referring to senior party leaders who are vocal against the present government, Natarajan said that people would realise that those who had ditched Jayalalithaa were now coming forward with false claims.
