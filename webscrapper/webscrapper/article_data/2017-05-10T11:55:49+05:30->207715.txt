 He added that the government would also lose around Rs 40 crore in luxury tax. At present, luxury tax earns the state government Rs 152 crore revenue.
 
 Parrikar said that there would be a loss of around Rs 137 crore from central sales tax (CST) and around Rs 300 crore loss from the collection of entry tax.
 
 “With this current structure of GST, there would be maximum revenue loss of around Rs 700 to Rs 800 for the state,” Parrikar said, but clarified that the state would gain from all the other services which will now come under the ambit of GST.
 
 Parrikar said that last year around Rs 1,308 crore was collected as revenue for the central government from service tax and excise duty. Under GST, 50% of these taxes will now remain with Goa.
 
 He also said that at present central revenue collection in Goa is projected at approximately Rs 2,000 crore and if it is collected at the GST rate of 18 per cent then the collection will go up to Rs 2,400 crore and half of this amount, Rs 1,200 crore, will remain with the state treasury.
 
 “That means our loses are a maximum of Rs 800 crore and our gain is a minimum of Rs 1,200 crore. There will be a minimum gain of Rs 300 to Rs 400 crore with GST,” he said. 
 
 Taking all facts into consideration, Parrikar predicts that Goa will gain between Rs 600 to Rs 1,000 crore in net revenue collection in the first year.
