ALLAHABAD: Two minors were burnt alive and another sustained critical injuries after they were allegedly set afire by their uncle in Allahabad , on Saturday.

 SSP (Allahabad)   said “Two children, iReeshu (5) and   (4), died at the hospital. The condition of another child Saurabh (12) is critical.” Police have arrested the accused Amarnath   who seems to be mentally unstable. Yadav told the police that he had taken the step after he was told to do so by an occultist.
 
 The incident took place when the three children were sleeping on two separate cots and the accused first sprinkled kerosene on two of his nieces-—Reeshu and Nitu—and and then sprinkled some of it on Saurabh. The kids’ parents had gone to work in the fields. When the accused set the cot on fire, Saurabh woke up after hearing their cries and tried to save himself.
 
 
 Hearing their cries, villagers rushed the spot and managed to douse the flames. After setting the three children ablaze, Yadav jumped into a nearby well. He was later rescued and arrested.
