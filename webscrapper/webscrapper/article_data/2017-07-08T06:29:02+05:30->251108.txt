JAIPUR:   (RU) has declared its third and last   for all  . While the Maharaja’s College and Commerce College published their final lists on Thursday, the   declared it on Friday.

 Unexpectedly, the cut-off percentage went below 80 for the BA course in Maharani’s College. But for other courses, there were no major changes in percentile and percentage points. There were also very few seats left for the third cut-off list.
 
 There was hardly any difference in the third merit list when compared to the second one, published on June 29, which left many students disappointed. Admissions to RU are getting harder every year as students are producing excellent results.
 
 “We got delayed in declaring the third cut-off list as there was so much confusion in the whole admission process. We had to make sure that deserving students did not lose out on the opportunity. Since there were many students with the same percentile, the selection process became complicated. But we have resolved all issues and made sure that deserving students got their due. There were a few exceptions as we had to consider children from rural areas. But that too was solved in the committee meeting yesterday,” said Alka Sharma, vice-principal, Maharani’s College.
 
 CBSE students faced many problems this year due to the percentile formula. From 2,100 students admitted in the first year, the number of CBSE students was under 150, which is very low and shows that CBSE students have been short-changed this year.
 
 There were students who were admitted on a first come basis to the BCA course of Maharaja’s College as many of them had the same marks and percentile.
 
 The last date for submission of fees online and document verification is July 11. If students fail to complete the process on time, they will not be considered later. 
 
 The RU has completed the admission process and regular classes will begin on Monday.
