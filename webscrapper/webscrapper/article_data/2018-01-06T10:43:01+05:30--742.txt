CHANDIGARH: To cash in on the world heritage status of  , the UT administration is planning to develop a heritage circuit to promote the site.

 The planned circuit would be developed under   – a 100% centrally funded scheme -- for which the administration would have to submit a proposal to avail the requisite funds. The circuit would comprise a route that would accommodate city’s three major tourist destinations -- Sukhna Lake, Rock Garden and Capitol Complex – and would have well-defined entry and exit points.
 
 Meanwhile, the administration has initiated the process of hiring a consultant for conducting pre-feasibility studies and preparation of detailed project reports (DPR) with special emphasis on promoting Capitol Complex on the heritage circuit.
 
 Initially, a conceptual DPR would be submitted to the Union ministry of tourism, which will be reviewed by the mission directorate (MD). The MD would give its recommendations to the central sanctioning and monitoring committee, which would further sanction the plan. After an in-principle approval, site evaluation will be done. Funds will be released only after submission of work orders and other applicable clearances.
