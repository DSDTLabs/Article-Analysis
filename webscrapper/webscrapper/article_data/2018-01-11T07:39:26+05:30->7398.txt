CHENNAI: Planning to visit   this holiday season, but dreading the serpentine queues outside the ticket counters? You need not. The zoo management has introduced online ticket booking from Wednesday, to let visitors buy entry tickets and pay for rides inside the zoo at clicks of a mouse.

 Zoo director S Yuvaraj told TOI that ticketing has gone online to give visitors a hassle-free access to the zoo, besides letting them save time and carry lesser cash.
 
  “During the Pongal holidays, the number of visitors to the zoo goes up. Every year, people have to wait very long to enter the zoo. Now with the online booking system, it will be easier for visitors,” Yuvaraj said.
 
 Those who book tickets online will have a separate queue to enter the zoo. Entry tickets and those for other rides can be booked on www.aazp.in and www.vandalurzoo.com. Those booking tickets online will get a confirmation message on their phones and via email. “Visitors who booked online have to produce the receipts along with an identity proof at the time of entering the zoo premises,” Yuvaraj said.
 
 Apart from online booking, visitors can use their debit or credit cards to book tickets at the 14 counters in the zoo.
