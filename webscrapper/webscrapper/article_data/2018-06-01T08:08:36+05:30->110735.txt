KOCHI: Buoyed by the success of   of umbrellas, the women of Attappadi tribal colony are now set to produce and market forest honey, cardamom, handicrafts, etc.

 
 What started off as a small attempt to help the ‘mothers of Attappadi’ make a living gained momentum with many panchayats and organizations placing bulk orders for the umbrellas made by the tribal women.
 
 An initiative of local NGO Thampu - Centre for Tribal Education Development and Research, these umbrellas have become a steady source ofincome for the women.
 
  “Several social welfare programmes to address the issue of malnutrition and poverty in Attappadi have been going on for quite sometime. But it somehow failed to gain attention,” said  , president, Thampu pointing at the success of the   brand.
 
 Starting with 1,000 umbrellas in 2016, this year, the women made about 20,000-25,000 umbrellas, mostly three-fold ones. “We got many orders but we didn’t have the money to buy raw material and meet the demand. The tribal welfare department has released funds early this time,” said Prasad.
 
 Around 150 women have been trained in umbrella-making. Initially, they used to make the umbrellas at their homes and now they have a space, as part of the integrated tribal development plan (ITDP), where they work as a group here. Around 60 women reach the office by 9.30am and work till evening. 
 
 “They take about four minutes to make an umbrella using a kit while with hand it takes about half-an-hour. Making 15 umbrellas would fetch them Rs 500,” Prasad said. 
 
 Meanwhile, the umbrellas were a big hit at Technopark and Infopark, with the group receiving more orders , said Ramesh, coordinator of the project.
