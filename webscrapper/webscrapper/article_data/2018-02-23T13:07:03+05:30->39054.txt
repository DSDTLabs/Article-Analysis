PATNA: The state government has ordered a probe into the construction of a temple allegedly at former health minister Tej Pratap Yadav’s behest on a government land near the 3, Deshratna   bungalow that had been allotted to him in his capacity as a minister.

 The inaugural plaque at the temple has   chief Lalu Prasad, his wife and ex-CM Rabri Devi and their sons Tej and Tejashwi Yadav’s names on it.
 
 State building construction minister   said on Thursday his department did not have prior knowledge about the temple. 
 
 “As a minister, Tej had taken the oath of not violating the law. But he illegally got a temple constructed on a government land,” the minister said and added a committee would probe the matter and take appropriate action.
 
 The temple, which has not been given finishing touches as yet, was opened to the public on the occasion of Mahashivaratri on February 13 in the presence of Tej. A function was organised to mark the occasion.
 
 Sources estimated a sum of around Rs 15 lakh was spent on the construction of the temple, christened ‘Shri Shri Banke Bihari Shiv Mandir’. It has a Shivling besides other deities. 
 
 The temple is located in the New Capital Area of the building construction department, which houses all the VVIP bungalows, including that of the CM.
 
 However, Tej’s RJD defended him, saying the construction of temple was a matter of faith. “Tej is a religious man... This temple is for everyone, not for him alone,” party spokesman   said and asked why didn’t the   government take action when the temple was being constructed after its stone was laid in August last year.
 
 Tej ceased to be a minister in July last year, but vacated the official bungalow last week, saying CM Nitish Kumar and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi had let loose ghosts to haunt him out of the property.
