NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro’s Violet line—which goes from ITO to Escorts Mujesar—faced a   at Mandi House on Tuesday around 4pm, causing delays on other lines as well. According to officials at  , it took two hours to clear the backlog and restore normalcy. This is the fifth glitch in the Metro system in a month.

  officials said the glitch was caused by a signalling issue in the reverse service at Mandi House station around 4pm. Only one track is functional at that station. The same train reverses on this track to return in the other direction. Officials said there was a signalling glitch after the train reversed at the station around 4pm. It took half an hour to sort out the problem, but it led to a bunching effect, that is, resulted in delays for other scheduled trains on the line. This triggered crowding at Mandi House and Central Secretariat stations.
 
 Officials said it took two hours for the schedule to normalise. “There was a signal problem for 20 minutes on Badarpur line around 4:35pm. The station was overcrowded and it took about two hours for the situation to improve,” said an official at Central Secretariat station. 
 
 The Violet line will soon be extended to Kashmere Gate, where it will join the Heritage line, slated to open next month.
 
 In last one month alone, five technical glitches have hit various lines of Metro. In the second week of January, the Blue line was badly affected on two consecutive days after losing contact with the Operational Control Centre, the nerve centre of the vast network, due to power failure.
 
 This prompted DMRC to issue an apology to commuters through a video statement posted on its website. Metro attributed the delay to its cautious approach, saying it did not want to "compromise" the safety of the passengers.
 
 On Tuesday, officials said Metro services will be affected on January 26 and January 29 due to the security arrangements for Republic Day and Beating Retreat.
