BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh is fast becoming the hockey ‘infrastructure heaven’ as another six turfs are coming up in different parts of the state.

 Once the work on these turfs is done, MP will become the state with the highest numbers of hockey turfs in the country.
 
  The new hockey turfs are coming up at Mandsaur, Indore, Shivpuri,  , Damoh and Gwalior. 
 
 Gwalior already has a hockey turf where women’s academy is functioning. However, the strength of the players has increased exponentially in the last couple of years. This has forced the   department to lay another hockey turf. At present, there are 9 hockey turfs in the state owned by sports department and Sports Authority of India. These are in Bhopal (4), Gwalior (3), Betul (1), and Seoni (1) while the work in Jabalpur is expected to start soon.
 
 MP sports minister   said the objective behind laying so many turfs is to promote hockey in the areas where talented players of the game are available. 
 
 Tenders have already been floated for the work. Sources said the sports department is mulling completing the construction work as early as possible. “The department wants to open academies in the places where hockey turfs have been sanctioned. These academies will be on the lines of Gwalior academy, which gave 9 players for Rio Olympics 2016,” said a senior player, pleading anonymity.
 
 Sports department is running women’s hockey academy in Gwalior. However, the academies that are likely to come in other parts of the state will be for both boys and girls. Hockey turf in Jabalpur was mired in a controversy over the past two years after Union sports ministry had sought back a sum of Rs 3.62 crore that it had released to MP for laying turf.
