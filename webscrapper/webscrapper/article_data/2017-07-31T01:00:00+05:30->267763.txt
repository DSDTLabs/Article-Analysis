On his recent visit to Delhi,   spoke about his experience of riding a bike in   and being chased around by hundreds of fans. The actor, who was shooting for his film then, said that riding a bike around the city was a completely different experience for him as that is something that he hasn’t done in his hometown Mumbai. “I have rarely driven on the streets of Mumbai. My father doesn’t allow me to ride a bike or drive a car and he is very strict about it. So when it comes to bikes or cars I have very little experience of riding them,” says the actor.

 Telling us about his shooting experience in Ghaziabad, Tiger says, “Shooting in Ghaziabad was good, but very difficult as there were so many people around. Delhi has very friendly people, sometimes over-friendly, which gets intimidating. If they are being loving towards you, you can’t say anything. I like people’s spirit here, khul ke jeete hain, gale lagate hain aur aise lagate hain ki phir chhorte hi nahi (laughs). When we were shooting a bike sequence, I was riding a bike around India Gate with my co-actor Nidhhi (Agerwal) and when I looked back, there were around 100 bikes chasing us. It was a great experience.”
 
 The actor, who also shot some parts of his film Heropanti in Delhi, says that he has visited Delhi only for shootings or film promotions, which is why he has never gotten a chance to go around the city. “I would really want to come on a vacation to Delhi, as the only time when I would not be dieting would be when I won’t be working. I want to taste all that good food that I have been hearing about. Till the time I get to come on a holiday to Delhi, I just hope I keep coming here for shooting,” says Tiger.
