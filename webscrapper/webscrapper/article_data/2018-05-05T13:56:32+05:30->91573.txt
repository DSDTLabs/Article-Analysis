It’s been a long time since artist N B Lathadevi and her disciple Nimisha Rao worked together.  When they wanted to get back after years, the duo decided, ‘Why not celebrate it with colours?’ Their exhibition 'Maya Rtuvarna,' on display at Durbar Hall Art Gallery, brought together many abstract paintings and nature-inspired works by the artists, based out of Thrissur. The show was recently inaugurated by art historian Vijayakumar Menon and the 50 odd paintings were in the mediums of acrylic, pen, ink, water colour and more. Lathadevi is an art teacher at Bharat Vidya Bhavan’s Vidya Mandir, Poochatty, Thrissur and Nimisha works as an independent artist.
