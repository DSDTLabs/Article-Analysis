ROHTAK: In another year of poor results, more than 48% students flunked   exams, whose results were declared by the Board of School Education, Haryana (BSEH) on Monday.

 
  
 The overall pass percentage stood at 51.15%, which is slightly better than 50.59% recorded in 2017. In 2016, just 48.88% students had cleared the exam.
 
 Haryana education minister Ram Bilas Sharma, who was present at the board headquarters in Bhiwani when the results were announced, attributed the higher rate of failure to ending the practice of awarding grace marks to students and the government’s tough stance against mass copying and use of unfair means during exams.
 
 He also took a dig at the previous government claiming that it had introduced a moderation policy to improve the results. Besides stopping the practice, the current government adopted zero tolerance towards mass copying and use of unfair means during exams which also had an impact on the results, he said.
 
 Meanwhile, just like Class XII results, girls fared better than boys in the exams. Whereas girls’ pass percentage stood at 55.34%, only 47.61% boys could pass the exam. In Class XII results announced on May 18, 72.38% girls had passed the exam as compared to 57.1% boys.
 
 Out of 3,64,800 students, 1,86,586 cleared Class X exams. Students of rural areas performed better than their counterparts from the urban areas. Pass percentage of rural students stood at 51.72% while it was 49.65% in the urban areas. Meanwhile, students of private schools, affiliated to BSEH, had better results than the government schools in Haryana. While 59.87% students of private schools cleared the exam, the success rate in the state-run schools was 44.3%.
 
 In some of worst performing districts, Mewat with 60.2% and Yamunanagar 58.01% finished second and third last from the bottom, respectively. While 52% students failed in Gurgaon, the results were even worse in Faridabad where the failure rate was 57%. In Karnal, 55% students flunked the examinations.
