Vijayawada: Days after YSRCP MP V Vijayasai Reddy made open allegations against special secretary to chief minister Satish Chandra, Andhra Pradesh IAS officers association has condemned his remarks.

 Few days ago, Reddy had alleged that Chandra, and senior IPS officer AB Venkateswara Rao, are resorting to corruption and helping the TDP in buying YSRCP MLAs. He even threatened that action will be taken against them when the YSRCP comes to power. In a statement issued by AP IAS officers association, Shashi Bhushan Kumar, water resources principle secretary and association general secretary, said: “Such threats of vindictive action against a civil servant are deplorable, and the association appeals to all political parties to desist from such irresponsible behaviour, and demoralising the civil service which is entrusted with accomplishing challenging tasks.”
 
 The association hailed Satish Chandra’s efforts in building necessary environment to carry out administration from Amaravati in the bifurcated state.
 
 In a separate statement, the association also condemned the criminal assault by MLAs of Delhi assembly on chief secretary of Delhi government on Tuesday night.
 
 “The assault on chief secretary is not only a criminal act, but also an attack on the independence and neutrality of the civil service. The fact that the incident took place in the presence of the chief minister and deputy chief minister makes it all the more reprehensible. This association extends its total support to Delhi IAS Association in its struggle for equity and fair-play between permanent and political executive,” Kumar said
 
 The association demanded a speedy legal action, and immediate arrest of all those who are involved in the attack. They demanded trial by a fast-track court.
