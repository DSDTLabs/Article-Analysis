VIJAYAWADA: With the Centre making it clear that special category status for   is not possible and most TDP MLAs and MLCs wanting the party to end its alliance with BJP, TDP president and chief minister   is likely to set the separation process in motion beginning with the resignation of two TDP ministers -   and Y S Chowdhary - from the Narendra Modi cabinet. 
 
  At the TDP legislature party meeting in   on Tuesday, all 125 MLAs and 34 MLCs, barring six absentees, pushed for ending the alliance with BJP, sources said. "CM Naidu is now set to take steps to end the alliance. It will begin with the two central ministers stepping down, most likely on March 10.
 
  Withdrawing support to the NDA at the Centre is likely to happen in the next few days after the two ministers resign," a source said. Congress president Rahul Gandhi waded into the tussle and said his party would grant special category status to Andhra Pradesh if voted to office in 2019.
