PUNE: The MG Road Hawkers’ Association (MRHA), at loggerheads with the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) over fire   issues flagged by the fire brigade, has started curtailing the size of   at Fashion Street   so that fire tenders could enter in case of a fire.

 M V Akolkar, MRHA president, told TOI, “At least 30 stall owners have reduced their extended structures in the past three days. We have appealed to illegal stall owners to vacate the market and have asked authorised stall owners to take precautionary measures.”
 
 Akolkar claimed that they have conducted several meetings with stall owners in the past few days and sensitized them about the fire audit report.
 
 According to MRHA members, a total of 120 illegal shops operate in the market. “We have held several rounds of discussion with these stall owners and urged them to vacate the market. However, these stall owners are adamant and not ready to discontinue their business. In fact, we have informed the board authorities about their activities,” an association member said.
 
 PCB’s chief executive officer D N   said, “We have called a meeting with MRHA members to discuss the agreement signed by the association with the board in 1997. It appears that the association has some confusion about certain clauses mentioned in the agreement.”
 
 The association members claimed that as per the agreement, PCB is supposed to provide them proper shelters and fire safety equipment at the market. But Yadav said that there was only a discussion on this aspect in 1997 though nothing was mentioned in this regard in the agreement.
 
 “The board officials were aware of illegal stalls but they didn’t initiate any action against them. We hope the board will take action against them in the coming days,” a shop owner said.
