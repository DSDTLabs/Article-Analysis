Veteran actor   said she fears that "all men are seen as bad'' in light of the   and #MeToo movements.

  
  
 The   said women should be wary of making sweeping statements. ''This year I do feel the spirit of the suffragettes is with us and we're speaking out about women being treated badly around the world. That said, I am terrified that all men are seen as bad."
 
 ''We mustn't deride all men, as only the few are bad and we need to remember that, too. I love and respect men. I am married to one, I work with some wonderful men and I have a son," Lumley told. Lumley, who most recently hosted the 2018   and wore black alongside the majority of attendees in support of the Time's Up initiative, praised the stars' decision to don the colour.
 
 "Even though they (the stars) were dressed in black, they looked wonderful. It felt right to wear black at the time in support of #MeToo. Anything that empowers women is to be supported," she said.
