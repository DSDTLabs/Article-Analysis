NEW DELHI:   Jail officials have given permission to three other convicts serving life term, apart from Manu Sharma, to be in  . While two of them — Ajit Singh and   — have decided to complete their studies, the third, Nand  , is working at a government construction project.   has been permitted to work for his NGO.
 
 Jail officials said that Kishor, Ajit and Tikam, who have served more than 15 years, were shifted to the semi-open jail two years ago. The men spent their first 12 years in jail number 2. All of them were convicted for heinous crimes like murder. The order to shift the convicts to the open jail was issued in September 2017 after a sentence review committee found their conduct favourable.
 
 “They were selected on the basis of their track records. None of the three men were found violating jail norms. After their good track record in the semi-open jail, they were allowed to leave the premises,” said a Tihar official.
 
 Tikam and Ajit have been attending coaching centres in the nearby area to prepare for higher studies. They are also permitted to look for a job. The   can leave the jail premises at 8am and have to return by 8pm.
 
 NGO officials said that Sharma has set up an office inside the jail from where he counsels convicts and their family members. They added that he met them a few weeks ago at a programme during which they celebrated the birthday of a child attending the NGO.
 
 Sharma has given the NGO’s address in Lajpat Nagar as his workplace. However, he reportedly stays inside the jail premises to look after fellow convicts who approach him for help. “He is allowed to attend the work of the NGO, meet the officials, but can’t stay back, attend public functions or stay at home and meet his family members,” said a jail official.
