GARHSHANKAR: With sand prices soaring in the state,   spokesperson   on Monday sought to expose the "sand cartel" operating in   area of Hoshiarpur. She alleged that the cartel was resorting to hoarding of sand to push the prices up.

 She also alleged that local police were working in cahoots with the "cartel" as they were challaning the tractor-trailers on different pretexts if they brought sand directly from   at lower rates and would rather ask them to lift it from the dump at inflated prices.
 
 Accompanied by over 100 tractor-trailer operators, who used to bring legally-mined sand from HP,   took newspersons to a dump illegally operated near the bus stop of Kot village on the forest land. 
 
 She pointed out that mining in   could not take place till September 30 and unscrupulous elements were making hay with the involvement of official machinery as well as the local police. 
 
 The workers at the dump who were issuing visiting cards to the tractor-trailer operators, lifting sand from there, left when the newspersons started questioning them. Their office is being run in the shops at the bus stop.
 
 The tractor-trailer operators alleged that they were purchasing a trailer load in Rs 800 from the legally-designated places in HP and they carried the receipts issued from the mining sites. They said they would unload the trailer to customers for Rs 2,000-2,200.
 
 "However in the last two-three weeks we are being stopped to go to HP to load the trailers and we are being forced to lift the sand from this dump for Rs 3,000. We have to charge Rs 4,000-4,500 from the customers due to that," said Jagdish
 
  When contacted,   said they were checking tractor-trailers, operating illegally.
