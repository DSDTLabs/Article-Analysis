NEW DELHI: Pushing the agenda of ‘ease of doing business’, the   has proposed fixed-term contract   across sectors, providing companies the flexibility to “hire and fire” according to their   needs. 

 In a draft notification, the labour ministry has proposed fixedterm employment, allowing companies across sectors to hire workers for short term assignments. At present, fixed-term employment is only allowed in the apparel manufacturing sector. The move is aimed at liberalising labour policies as it will facilitate hire-and-fire as per the need of a company by reducing strict retrenchment conditions and help overhaul the country’s archaic labour laws. 
 
 The government said it is for extending fixed-term   beyond the textile and apparel sector. “In the   (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 (20 of 1946), in Schedule, in item 1, for the words ‘fixed term employment workmen in apparel manufacturing sector’ shall be substituted,” says a draft rule. 
 
 These rules which may be called the “Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Central (Amendment) Rules, 2018”, says subject to the  , “no notice of termination of employment shall be necessary in the case of temporary and badli workmen; and no workman employed on fixed term employment basis as a result of non-renewal of contract or employment or on its expiry, shall be entitled to any notice or pay in lieu thereof, if his services are terminated”.
