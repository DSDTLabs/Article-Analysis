MUMBAI: Even as the Bombay high court on Thursday directed the state government to reply if due procedure was followed while denotifying 33 hectares at   in Goregaon for the   III car shed, it wondered what will remain of Mumbai by the time the work is finished. “We wonder if at the end of all this, we be left with any bit of Mumbai or only  ?” said a bench of Justices S C Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dangre in a lighter vein.

 Referring to roads dug up all over the city by   (MMRC) for Metro III (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz), the judges asked how long will the work go on. “Wherever you want to go, it takes minimum two hours to reach. Courtesy you (MMRC)!’’ the bench said.
 
 The court heard a PIL challenging the August 24, 2017, notification changing the land from non-development zone to reservation for the car shed. Senior advocate Janak Dwarkadas, representing the petitioner, argued that proper procedure was not followed and also that there was an alternative site at  .
 
 But MMRC’s advocate Shardul Singh said the Kanjurmarg plot was under litigation. He said a committee recommended in 2015 that if the land was not available within three months, they should go with the Aarey plot. Singh submitted that the proposal was for a car shed and commercial zone but the state government only approved the car shed. “The proposed construction work will be done in such a way so as to cause minimum damage,’’ said Singh, adding that work on 10 hectares had started.
 
 When the judges sought the state government’s stand, its advocate replied that it was similar to that of MMRC. “Is the state running the Metro or is the Metro running the government?” the high court bench quipped.
