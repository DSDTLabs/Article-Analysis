AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday issued a notice to its Bar association, over their decision to strike work on Friday to push for filling of vacant posts of judges.

 The Gujarat High Court Advocates’ Association (GHAA) has resolved to take out a march from   and strike work on Friday. Advocate Amit Panchal filed a petition against the decision to strike work, argueing that Supreme Court’s orders prohibit lawyers from going on strike.
 
 The   sought a reply from GHAA by April 27. The high court also suspended another GHAA resolution, with regard to their view on Gujarat HC judges not being appointed as chief justices at other high courts and not being elevated to the apex court. GHAA had itself deferred this agenda until “a deserving high court judge comes into the zone of consideration for elevation as chief justice or   judge”. This led the HC to comment that passing such a resolution was beyond the authority of GHAA.
