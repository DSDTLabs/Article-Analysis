Panjim: Villagers from areas that were proposed to be included under the Greater Panaji Planning and Development Authority and others will go ahead with their peaceful protest march to Azad Maidan on April 6. Protesters will assemble at Patto Plaza at 3pm and silently wend their way to Azad Maidan. In a meeting held at St Cruz, on Monday evening, protesters from Chimbel, Merces, Azossim, Mandur, Batim and other places discussed the course of action. Some representatives from Candolim and Calangute, who are also opposing the PDA proposal were present at the meeting. Town and country town planning (TCP) minister Vijai Sardesai had recently announced exclusion of villages after strong protests, stating that only the core planning area on the Kadamba plateau will be retained for vertical development, stating that it was needed to cater to development needs. “The PDAs are unconstitutional, as there is no people’s consent in the planning exercise as enshrined in the 73rd and 74th amendment of the Constitution of India,” Arturo D’Souza of Goenkars Against PDA said. Representatives from Calangute and Candolim extended their support to the agitation.  The meeting discussed the proposed revival of RP 2021 and criticised the government for adopting a bureaucratic top-to-bottom approach without enforcing participatory planning. Among those who attended the meeting were Rodolfo Fernandes, Roshan Mathias from Candolim and Rama Kankonkar from Curca.
