AHMEDABAD: A   has issued show-cause notice to three alleged bootleggers on why the same court’s order granting them bail should not be cancelled.

 The Metropolitan Court No.11 asked Vijay Patidar (28), Ismailkhan Pathan (35) and Samirkhan Pathan (36) about their bail cancellation after the court learned that they had lied before the court when they declared that it was their first bail application since their arrest in April.
 
 It came to the court’s knowledge that all the three accused had first approached the city sessions court, but were denied bail by additional sessions judge   on May 2. It was later that they approached the lower court and allegedly suppressed the fact that they were denied bail by the higher court.
 
 Interestingly, the scope for this confusion arose following the amendment to the Prohibition Act, by which the state government introduced severe punishments for violation of the law. This led to a change in the jurisdiction of the courts.
 
 The trio was arrested on April 21 from   in  , with 267 bottles of IMFL worth Rs 5.87 lakh. They were moving the stock from a car to a house in a bylane in the walled city.
