BHOPAL: He teaches electronics but his dance moves are electric. Sanjeev Srivastava, an assistant professor at Bhopal’s Bhabha Engineering Research Institute, has set the internet on fire with a video of his dance on a number from 1987 Govinda-starrer “Khudgarz” going viral on social media and news channels since Thursday evening.

 
 Stunned by his overnight fame, the 46-year-old ‘uncle dancer’ said the recognition he chased as a teenager has found him in middle age. “I never expected in my wildest dreams that a one-minute video of me dancing at a family function would go viral. I am overwhelmed,” he told TOI from Vidisha, his hometown.
 
 
  
 
 Even Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan applauded, tweeting: “Professor Sanjeev Srivastava Ji ki zindadili ne pure Bharat mein internet par tehelka macha diya hai. Mano ya na mano, Madhya Pradesh ke paani mein, kuchh toh khaas baat hai (The liveliness of professor   has swept the country and internet. There is something special about Madhya Pradesh).”
 
 
  
 
  
 
 Srivastava had to take Friday off just to field calls from friends, relatives and the media. “It’s kind of crazy. It’s been like this since last night. Feels wonderful,” he laughed.
