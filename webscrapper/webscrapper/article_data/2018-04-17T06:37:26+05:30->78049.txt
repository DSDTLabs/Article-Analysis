NEW DELHI: Over a decade after it was set up, the finance ministry is set to revamp the operations of   (IIFCL) with the government tasking it with funding projects of “social and national importance”, a top government official said.

 So, apart from its current role of financing infrastructure projects on commercial terms, IIFCL will also be mandated to finance projects such as a tunnel around Rohtang Pass to provide year-round connectivity. Similarly, IIFCL will have to finance the Rs 6,100-crore  , Asia’s longest bi-directional tunnel that is projected to reduce the travel time through the pass to 15 minutes from the current three-and-ahalf hours.
 
 Similarly, if IITs are to be strengthened, instead of creating a higher education financing agency, IIFCL will be asked to provide support, where the entire loan need not be repaid as it is seen to be an investment in human resource development, economic affairs secretary   told TOI.
 
 “These are the sociallydesirable, strategically important but commercially unviable projects, which need to be funded by the government. These are done by the government or some government agencies —   does some of these projects and railways does some of them... We have ideas to create a vehicle to fund these strategic, iconic and socially-important projects,” Garg said.
 
 In the last Budget, finance minister   had touched upon the plan to leverage IIFCL to help finance major infrastructure projects. As a first step, discussions are underway to move IIFCL from one wing of the finance ministry, the department of financial services, to another, the department of economic affairs. “Its restructuring, its reform is under discussion. The existing institution will continue to fund private sector debt. How do you fund it and restructure it is being discussed,” Garg said.
