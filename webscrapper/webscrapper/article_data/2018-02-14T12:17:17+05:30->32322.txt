JAIPUR: It was meant to be the country’s most daring   heist ever, its participants were supposed to get several lakhs of rupees. But their dreams fizzled out when their robbery bid soon turned into a comedy of errors. 

 The penniless robbers now have nothing to blame except for their luck and the kingpin Hanuman Laden who tricked them into it. The police are now raiding across many cities of western Rajasthan to arrest Laden and his other aides.
 
 “We are raiding cities including Pali to arrest him, Om Prakash, Sunil and Ashok,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Vikas Pathak. 
 
 The nine rookie criminals banded together by absconding Laden, still cannot believe they fell victim to trickery. The gang members were not paid anything by Laden. In fact, according to DCP Pathak, one of the gang members even had to pay for the diesel.
 
 The police said that after the gang’s planning was foiled by a constable who was present inside the centralised chest branch of a private bank on February 6, the visibly shaken robbers made a quick retreat. 
 
 The four kingpin of the gang had told the rest nine that they were on mission to Jaipur where they will rob a Hawala trader and become rich. It was only when the robbers barged into the bank containing nearly Rs 925 crore that they realised they have been duped and it is a heavily guarded bank.
 
 “A drill was also prepared in which each member was assigned a particular task. Including that of jumping the gate and slapping the supposed guard of the Hawala trader before robbing him,” an official said.
 
 The robbers, who were hitherto unaware of actual plan, jumped inside the bank. Here they were told by the guard that there were four policemen present inside. Around same time constable Sita Ram fired at them, forcing them to flee.
