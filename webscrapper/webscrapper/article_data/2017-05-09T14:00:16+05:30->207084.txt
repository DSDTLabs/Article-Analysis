PANAJI: The   of Goa police has found clues in the mysterious death of undertrial   in Sada sub-jail after recoding the statements of inmates and guards.

 A senior police officer said the recording is complete and the accused would be arrested soon. “We cannot divulge more information for now,” he said.
 
 Karbotkar, who is facing trial in over 10 criminal cases, was killed on January 24, 2017 after a fight broke out between two factions of inmates. Some of them were also injured in the melee.
 
 As the Crime Branch failed to get any clue initially, the superintendent of police,  , formed a special team to crack the case.
 
 In February, the government had transferred the case to Crime Branch. It has so far recorded the statement of 30 inmates, 30 police personnel and 15 jail staff. Both jail inmates and police personnel were blaming one another for the murder.
 
 The CCTV footage of the incident was unavailable as the cameras and hard disks were damaged.
 
 Six months before his murder, Karbotkar was slapped with the charge of killing history-sheeter, Ashpak Bengre, at the central jail, Colvale, where both had been lodged. After the incident, he was shifted to Sada, Vasco.
 
 The postmortem examination of 27-year-old murder accused had revealed that he had died of “haemorrhage and shock” as a result of combined multiple injuries caused by a blunt object, could be a stick.
