SURAT: City police plan to adopt a tracking facility which will allow each applicant who submits a written   to the city police commissionerate to know about its current status. 

 An identification number given to the applicant will make tracking of the application possible even over phone. The applicant can call on the toll-free number of the city police and inquire about the status of his or her application and need not go to different locations. This will be part of the single-window system being developed at the city police commissionerate where all types of applications will be accepted at one location and dispatched to the departments concerned later.
 
 “We are developing a single-window system for submission of applications at the police commissionnerate. This new system will help an applicant track his or her application and get the work done without much trouble,” city police commissioner Satish   said. 
 
 At present, a number of applicants submit their applications for various purposes at the police commissioner’s office and then keep visiting it personally to check the status. This proves difficult for most of the applicants and they never get to know the exact update on their applications. 
 
 “This system was developed in Vadodara and later implemented in 11 other districts of the state. It is very useful system to monitor. We have already started work on it and a part of it will be outsourced,” Sharma added.
 
 The project will take a month’s time to start. The system is being introduced to bring in transparency in clearing of the applications in a time-bound manner. In another major reform, the city police commissioner has authorized the deputy commissioners of police to give approval to register complaints in land-related disputes, which earlier used to be the prerogative of the police commissioner.
