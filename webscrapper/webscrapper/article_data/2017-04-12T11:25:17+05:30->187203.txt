NAGPUR: Discontent is brewing among assistant conservators of forests (ACFs) cadre over out-of-turn promotions by the state government.

 On April 7, the state promoted 13 junior ACFs and divisional forest officers (DFOs) as per seniority list. However, while promoting these 13 ACFs, 5 senior ACFs, who were direct recruits of 2009-11 batch, were denied promotions.
 
 The reason for not promoting 5 competent ACFs is that their probation period ended on June 23, 2016, and the date of passing departmental exam was also June 23, 2016. 
 
 As per Recruitment Rules 1998, probation of   will be of three years, which includes two years of training in Dehradun and one year field exposure.
 
 The 5 ACFs have completed two years of training in Dehradun in 2009-11. And completed one year of probation 2011-2012. Now as per rules, a candidate should qualify for departmental exam after expiration of probation. 
 
 In case of one ACF, he gave departmental exam in 2015 and result was out in 2016. Now the forest ministry unduly extended his probation till date of passing exam, which is nowhere mentioned in the rule. 
 
 For promotion as DFO, an ACF should have completed three years of service. “So if our probation ended in 2016, we need to wait for 3 years,” said an ACF.
 
 Now 24 ACFs of 2009-11 batch were promoted in 2016. All of them passed exam either in 2014 or 2015. For their promotion, rule of 3 years of service was bypassed and all of them were promoted without any hassles. 
 
 Forest sources said there is another GR of 1997, which says that for promotion, period of probation should be counted while considering period of service for promotion.
 
 “With this logic, denial of promotions to us is injustice. We will move   (MAT),” said a section of ACFs.
 
 Shockingly, among those who were denied promotion includes ACFs Vishal Mali and Manoj Khairnar. Mali was responsible for tracking several tiger poachers and their conviction too. He also established first wildlife cyber cell of India in Melghat. Similarly, ACF Khairnar removed huge encroachments from  , which has become tiger habitat now.
