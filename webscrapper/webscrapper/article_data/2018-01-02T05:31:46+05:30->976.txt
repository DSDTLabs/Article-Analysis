 Myleene Klass said she doesn't stick to New Year resolutions.

 Reportedly, the 39-year-old always makes some pledges for the coming year even though she knows she won't stick to them.
 
 According to a report, Klass said,"I think I do what everybody does, I make New Year's resolutions and break them five minutes later, they are meant to be broken, surely? I don't go for anything that's too unreachable."
 
 In 2018, Klass is planning to brush up on her language skills.
 
 Asked what her 2018 resolution will be, she said: "Try harder at learning  , I've got to work on my Spanish, that's my resolution, it's something in my power that I can do."
