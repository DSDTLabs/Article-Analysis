GURUGRAM: Students, in an online petition, have written to the   seeking leniency while examining the   Class 12   exam paper. 

 The petition initiated on Change.org by a user named Harmeet Nahar on the same day of the exam has so far gathered more than 5,000 supporters, many of whom are from Gurgaon. “NCERT being the prescribed book for board exams, we expected questions to revolve around concepts from the book. But such was not the case this time around,” the petition has claimed. 
 
 Responding to the online plea over the question paper, a CBSE official said, “We always send observation schedules to schools. If they find a problem, they are supposed to inform us. If the issue come up before the experts, a relevant action will be taken on the basis of the merit it deserves.”
