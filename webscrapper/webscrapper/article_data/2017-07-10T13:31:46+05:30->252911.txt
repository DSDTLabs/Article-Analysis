  Talking about the initiative, Vikas says, "Tattoo industry is becoming a huge business and so, I decided to give these acid attack survivors free training so that if they choose, they can become professional tattoo artists. Instead of helping them with just money, the idea is to give them a living. We hope to boost their confidence and welcome them to work in our studios."
 
  Ruqaiyya, 30, an acid attack survivor says that, "I feel the job of a tattoo artist is very dynamic, challenging and interesting and I am also considering applying for a scholarship at Vikas’s  ."
 
  Laxmi, an acid attack survivor and founder of Sheroes Hangout café, says, "After the training here, these acid attack survivors will start a tattoo studio in this Agra café."
