The Aadhaar card, as we all know, is a 12-digit unique identification number issued by the   (UIDAI). It has been made loud and clear that the Aadhaar is mandatory to be linked with a host of essential services. The   is based on the biometric and demographic data of the citizens of India and has to be linked with permanent account numbers (PAN), bank accounts, financial services, including public provident fund (PPF), national savings certificates (NSC), mobile phone numbers (SIMs) and insurance policies, among several other things. The deadline for doing so is March 31, 2018.

 But in case you are an   (non-resident Indian) looking to link your Aadhaar card, you need not worry. As per the government criteria, NRIs do not have to link their Aadhaar for banking, mobile, PAN and other services. 
 
 ● Aadhaar is only for residents of India. NRIs are not eligible to get Aadhaar.
 ● The service providers like banks and mobile companies have themselves laid down NRI-specific exemptions.
 ● NRIs should simply tell the banks and other service providers such as credit card companies etc that they are not required to provide Aadhaar numbers by virtue of being non-resident Indians.
 
 NRIs are exempted from linking Aadhaar with various services.
