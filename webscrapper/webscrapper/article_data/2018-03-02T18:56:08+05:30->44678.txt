There was an air of mischief and joy at  , Kochi, on March 1, when the students celebrated   as part of the campus biennale.
As people across the country celebrated the festival of colours, these youngsters proved that they are not behind, when it comes to the Holi shenanigans. The colours smeared on each otherâ€™s faces translated into hues of happiness. The students were seen running around the college, trying to evade getting splashed by coloured water.
