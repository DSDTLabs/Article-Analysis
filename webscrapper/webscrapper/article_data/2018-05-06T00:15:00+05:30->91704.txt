Guntur: The 55-year-old man accused of raping a minor girl two days ago was found hanging from a tree in the forest near the Amaralingeswara Swamy Temple at Daida in Gurajala mandal on Friday afternoon. A few hours later, Andhra Pradesh home minister N Chinnarajappa told the media that Annam Subbaiah, a rickshaw puller, had hanged himself from a tree with a lungi.

 Police said Subbaiah lured the nine-year-old girl to his house in Dachepalle village with biscuits on Wednesday night and committed the crime. The profusely bleeding victim then narrated the incident to her parents following which villagers staged protests, blocked highways and vandalised the accusedâ€™s house. A massive manhunt was launched on Thursday to nab Subbaiah who was on the run.
