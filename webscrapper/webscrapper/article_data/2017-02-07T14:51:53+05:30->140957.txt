NEW DELHI: Hitting back at   vice-president over his 'earthquake' remark, 
  that the earthquake finally took place - the mother Earth was likely angered.

 Replying to the discussion on motion of thanks to President Pranab Mukherjee's address,   said, "Finally earthquake occurred. Central government is in touch with state the government."
 
 Lashing out at   over his 'scam' remark, Modi asked, "How can someone see 'seva' or any positive virtue in the word 'scam'. 
 
 PM comments come hours after 
  on Monday night, with tremors felt across Uttarakhand, Delhi and adjoining areas, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana.
 
 On December 9 last year, 
  - if he's allowed to speak in the   - has the potential to cause an "earthquake." 
 
 "The government is running from debate. If they allow me to speak then you will see what an earthquake will come," Rahul Gandhi had said. 
 
 PM Modi also attacked the Congress over the role of "one family" in the freedom struggle and said they had neglected the contribution of others.
 
 "There are many people like me who couldn't die for the nation during the freedom struggle but we are living for India and serving India," Modi said during a debate on Motion of Thanks to the President's address.
 
 "Somewhere on the way, 'Jan Shakti' (people power) was forgotten and we don't accept this," he said. 
 
 "I never heard them speak about the role of Chandrasekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh and many other freedom fighters who laid down their lives for the country," Modi said.
 
 "They think the country got independence only due to one family," Modi said in an apparent attack on the Nehru dynasty.
 
 He said India had to be taken to newer heights. "Faith in Jan Shakti will give results."
