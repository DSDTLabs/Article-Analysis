CHENNAI: The   is just over a fortnight away, with India playing their first match against US on October 6, and coach   is busy giving last-minute touches to the squad’s preparations in Goa. Even though De Matos admitted, in an interview to TOI, that the gulf between the Indian side and the rest is wide — a view which his players also shared — he is preparing the boys to give it their all in their three group matches against US, Chile and  .

 According to the players, the major focus, it seems, is to improve their defending ability from set pieces. In India’s last and final exposure tour of Mexico last month, the colts had conceded nine goals in three matches, seven of them from set pieces. While five of them were from corners, two were free-kicks. The side’s holding midfielder   said the focus in the last few days has been to improve the on-field communication between players.
 
 “We are not learning anything new but just brushing up our skills which we learnt in the last two years. The focus now is to overcome a few of our weaknesses in set pieces and attack. Both are key aspects of our game and it depends on how we communicate. So we are following our coach’s instructions and working on our communication skills and positioning,” the 17-year-old Wangjam told TOI on Tuesday.
 
 India are hosting the Under-17 World Cup for the first time from October 6.
