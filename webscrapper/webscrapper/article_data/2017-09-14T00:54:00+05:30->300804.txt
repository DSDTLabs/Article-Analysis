Chennai: Tambaram-Sengottai-Tambaram special fare special trains which were earlier announced as cancelled will now be operated, but in a different route.

 The Southern Railway, on Monday announced that these special trains, to be operated via Chidambaram and Mayiladuthurai, were cancelled due to operational reasons. However, to meet the demands of public and pilgrims during the Cauvery Pushkaram-2017, the Southern Railway has revoked its decision and has announced that the trains will be operated via Virudachalam, Tiruchchirappalli.
 
 Advance reservations for these trains will commence at 08.00 hours on September 13.
 
 Also, a superfast special fare   will be run from Thiruvananthapuram to Howrah via Coimbatore and Chennai Central, to clear extra rush due to dislocation of train services caused by heavy rains and flooding of railway tracks in Northeast Frontier Railway, said a release.
 
 Besides this, Coimbatore-Lokmanya Tilak Terminus Express, scheduled to leave Coimbatore at 8.55am on September 15 is fully cancelled due to cancellation of the pairing train.
