MUMBAI: A day after senior cleric and sacked member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board   said he would not push for an out-of-court settlement to the Ayodhya dispute, another senior Islamic scholar and   chairman Dr Zafrul Islam Khan has supported Nadvi's views on an out- of-court settlement, and on shifting of the mosque away from the disputed site in Ayodhya. He, too, is in the eye of a storm since a few Urdu news portals carried his opinion on Saturday. 

 Delhi-based Khan who is a former president of  , an umbrella body of over 40 Muslim organisations, in a piece he penned in Urdu on Saturday, backs Nadvi for making efforts to end the long-running dispute but disagrees that Art of Living (AOL) founder   could have convinced the Hindu organisations to accept the formula. "Maulana Salman Nadvi's suggestion is logical but who will listen to Sri Sri Ravishankar Involve the government, the Supreme Court or the RSS and take the parties on board," he said. Defending Nadvi, he said he has known him for the last three decades as a learned and upright person. "I have differed with him at times but I have never doubted his integrity," he said. "Maulana Nadvi capitualated to pressure but I will not and I stand by what I have suggested," he added.
 
 When told that AIMPLB has repeatedly reiterated its stand that Muslims would wait for the Supreme Court verdict and 'once a mosque always a mosque', Khan, an alumnus of the Cairo-based famous Islamic seminary Al-Azhar explained: "There is no textual (Quran or Hadith, the Prophet's traditions) to support this claim that once a mosque always a mosque. There many examples of shifting mosques in Arab countries, especially Saudi Arabia. In the 970s, I saw in Tripoli (Libya) a grand mosque from the city's Main Square being moved. No Muslim scholar opposed it. This can be done with the   Mosque too."
