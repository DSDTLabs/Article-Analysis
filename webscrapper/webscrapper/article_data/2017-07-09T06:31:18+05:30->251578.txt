CHENNAI: Private sector cardiologists can soon do life-saving stenting and angioplasty in Tamil Nadu government  . 

 As of now, cath labs in government hospitals are open only between 8am and 3pm, but by inviting private   to its facilities when there is no government doctor for emergencies, the state will be able to offer round-the-clock care.
 
 As a part of its cardiac care policy, aimed at reducing the incidence of deaths due to heart diseases, the state plans to add at least 11 cath labs, where non-surgical cardiac procedures such as angiogram and angioplasty are done. Presently, five cath labs are operational in Stanley Medical College Hospital and Government mulch-speciality Hospitals in Chennai, Rajaji Government   in Madurai and   Government General Hospital. 
 
 The state now plans to pay government doctors to do these procedures beyond duty hours and empanel private doctors to work in its facilities.
