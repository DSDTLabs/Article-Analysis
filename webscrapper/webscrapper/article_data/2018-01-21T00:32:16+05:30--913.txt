Chennai: A day after Tamil Nadu government increased the bus fare by 67%, opposition parties demanded a rollback, criticising the Edappadi K Palaniswami government for failing to clean up the transport department’s   and for further burdening the people.

 DMK working president M K Stalin said the government should have tried to earn revenue through advertisements on buses and also by utilising them as carrier for goods. The DMK-affiliated trade union Labour Progressive Federation (LPF) had been in the forefront of a recent bus strike, seeking higher wages for transport employees. 
 
 The CPM too criticised the government and announced a state-wide protest on January 22. The CPM’s trade union CITU had also participated in the bus strike. The Congress, PMK and CPI have also condemned the government’s decision to hike fares. 
 
 “It is only to cover up the way they have managed the transport companies that the government has increased the fares. There is also an allegation that the fares may have been increased to help Omni bus owners,” said Stalin. 
 
 The CPM state secretary, G Ramakrishnan, said the increase in bus fare by a minimum of 60% to a maximum of 100% showed the government had not managed the transport department properly. The CPM will protest in all taluks and towns on January 22, he said. 
 
 The government should have increased the fare each year instead of increasing it at one-go, said TNCC chief S Thirunavukkasarar. 
 
 The PMK has announced a state-wide protest on January 25. “The sudden announcement was only to give people an unpleasant surprise,” said PMK founder S Ramadoss. Other smaller parties too opposed the bus fare hike. DMK has announced state-wide protests against the fare hike on January 27.
