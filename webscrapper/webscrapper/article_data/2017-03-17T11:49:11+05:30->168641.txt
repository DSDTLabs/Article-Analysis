NASHIK: Autorickshaws plying without proper documents or permits in the city will face a hard time now as the   police have launched a drive to keep a check on them.

 “We have launched a drive where the traffic   personnel will examine the documents of autorickshaws and the mandatory measures will be implemented for the safety of commuters. There are a sizeable number of autorickshaws which are unfit to ply on the roads or are illegally run by the owners without documents. We shall come down heavily on such vehicles,” said assistant commissioner of police (traffic)  .
 
 The documents will include those issued by the police like   (RTO) and pollution control board. 
 
 “All those autorickshaws that have these documents in place will be given a sticker by the city police to be stuck on the front of the vehicle,” said Bajbale.
 
 The sticker will also have a number given by the office as per the records submitted. The sticker will mean that the vehicle stood by the norms and may not necessarily be checked again for a certain period. 
 
 “Such autos can still be penalised for violating norms like jumping a traffic signal and over loading of vehicles. The primary aim of the drive is to ensure that every   plying in the city fulfils all the conditions,” the officer said.
 
 He also pointed out that the vehicles that are not unfit to be plying would be seized and destructed so that they are not driven again.
 
 “The drive will continue till the time there is a sticker on every autorickshaw running in the city,” said Bajbale, adding that “the intention of the drive is to make sure that all vehicles comply to all the norms ensuring safety of one and all.”
