Television (TV) is one of the greatest inventions and a major source of entertainment and information across the globe. Nowadays, generally everyone has access to a television. As they say, even roses have thorns; so also there are drawbacks of watching too much television.

 Researchers found that the risk of developing a venous   was 1.7 times higher in those who reported they watch television "very often" compared with those who watch television "never or seldom." Every year, it is estimated that between 300,000 to 600,000 people in the U.S. develop venous thromboembolism, making it the most common vascular diagnosis after a heart attack or stroke.
 
 Watching television itself is not that bad, but it is our tendency to eat snack and sit still for a long time while watching television.

This is the first study conducted on a western population to look at the blood clots in the veins of the legs, arms, pelvis and lungs which is known as venous thromboembolism ( ).
 
 One can put a treadmill or stationary bike in front of the television and move while watching. Or watching the television can be delayed by 30 minutes; after taking a walk. Otherwise, it can be taped while you are out walking so that you can watch it later without the advertisements.
