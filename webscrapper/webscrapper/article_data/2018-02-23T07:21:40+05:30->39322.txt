CHENNAI: A traffic inspector of the Chennai police became abusive and started manhandling journalists of TOI on Thursday, when they questioned his move to take away bikes parked along T Nagar's  , which does not have a designated parking lot. 

 N  , inspector attached to the   traffic enforcement wing, pushed two photo journalists and used filthy language after it was pointed out that the vehicles were being moved by owners, and that the police did nothing to remove omni buses, vans, roadside shops and other vehicles parked nearby.
 
 The removal bid comes in the wake of a series of articles and photographs published in TOI, highlighting rampant encroachment of city roads and platforms, and how the police choose to remove encroachments selectively. On Thursday evening, when inspector Ramesh asked who the owners of the vehicles parked outside TOI's   office were, the journalists started removing the vehicles. He still chided them and asked them why they were running away. 
 
 When a photo journalist asked him to mind his language and requested him not to yell into the mike, he got down and pushed him away. He also asked his subordinate to photograph and videograph everyone, including the TOI office. He also towed a few vehicles away, which had to be later retrieved from the Pondy Bazaar police station. Police commissioner A K   did not respond to TOI's queries on the abusive behaviour of the inspector, video proof of which is available with TOI. 
 
 However, another senior police officer said, "There is no connection between news published in TOI and towing of vehicles. Inspector Ramesh claimed to have received information about illegal parking in the area. On finding cars and bikes parked on the platform he mistook them for vehicles belonging to an omni bus company in the vicinity. After request from the TOI staff, detained vehicles were returned."
