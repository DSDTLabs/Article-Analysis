LUCKNOW: The two Samajwadi Party MLAs occupying the bench where powerful explosive PETN was discovered have been identified. 

 Sleuths from the anti-terrorist squad of UP Police on Saturday questioned   from Unchahar and former minister   for 20 minutes at his residence in the city.
 
 The second SP MLA, Anil Kumar Dohare from Kannauj, was out of the city and has assured to give his statement on Monday. 
 
 The two were present on the third row bench on July 11 when the government presented the Budget.
 
 A DySP-rank officer and three policemen in plain clothes spoke to Pandey for 20 minutes at his residence and sought answers to two crucial questions. These were whether he saw the substance on Tuesday and how much time he spent in the House on the day. 
 
 “Pandey denied having seen anything unusual. He reached inside the House around 11am and spent about 90 minutes there,” said an investigator.
 
 The colourless crystalized substance, which turned out to be PETN, was found right beneath the cushion of seat number 80, where Pandey was sitting. Dohare was sitting next to him.
 
 IG Asim Arun said, “Besides MLAs, statements of 16 more people have been recorded on Friday and Saturday.”
 
 Among them are seven employees who look after cleaning and maintenance work. The rest of them are engineers, air conditioner operators, gazetted officers posted in the administration department and security personnel who have access to the main hall during sessions. A vendor who provides manpower to the department has also been summoned. 
 
 ATS is examining footage from 23 cameras.
 
 ATS sleuths also questioned Ashok Yadav, the bomb detection and disposal squad member who spotted the substance first and raised an alarm. Joginder Singh Pundir, the marshal who collected the powder, was also questioned.
