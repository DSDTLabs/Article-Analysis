AHMEDABAD: Patidar quota agitation leader   on Sunday alleged that leaders of his outfit,   ( ), were paid by some businessmen through the ruling BJP to put obstructions in his stir.   made his comment after a video went viral showing a Surat-based businessman, Mukesh Patel, saying that he can negotiate about money, if the outfit’s leaders drop the idea of agitation against the government.

 
 The video went viral in different community groups, after which Hardik also alleged that his former aides, who had either rejected him as a leader or joined the BJP were paid big sums.
 
 “Allegations were levelled at me by using my former aides after paying them huge amounts. They used to allege that I was deviating from this agitation, but they are all exposed now. The people who can cheat their own conscience cannot remain firm with the community,” said Hardik.
 
 Hardik mentioned his former colleagues including Dinesh Bambhania, Reshma Patel, Varun Patel, Chirag Patel, Ketan Patel and Botad PAAS convener Dilip Sabva alleging that all of them had been bought by the BJP. tnn
