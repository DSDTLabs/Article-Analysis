CHANDIGARH:   dominated most of the proceedings on Saturday, but saved their best for the last minute when  's field goal crossed out  ' 1-0 lead to seal the   match 2-1in favour of the visitors at the Sector-42 Sports Complex here.

  held firm in the Warriors' post for 59 minutes, when Kemperman hit a bouncing ball past the Punjab 'keeper to spark celebrations in the Mumbai camp, who are now virtually through to their maiden semifinals as they lead the table with 28 points after seven matches. The victory continued Mumbai's dominance over Punjab this season, as they had won 10-4 at home.
 
 Played in front of a sparse crowd, Punjab scored in the 37th minute after the first two quarters remained goalless. It was the Dutch drag flicker and Punjab's highest scorer of the league, Mink van der Weerden, who deposited his aerial flick to the top right corner of the net.
 
 Mumbai dominated play right from the start but their luck, or the lack of it, could best be described by the double shot at goal they had as early as the 3rd minute and a field goal disallowed in the third quarter. Skipper   weaved through Punjab defenders to get within five metres of the post but Clemons blocked the first shot and then the rebound to deny Mumbai the lead.
