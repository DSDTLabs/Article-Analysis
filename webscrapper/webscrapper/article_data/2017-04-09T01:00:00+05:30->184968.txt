Despite it being a weekday, when our photog dropped in at this pub, he saw a good turnout at this party. They all had only one agenda in mind â€” to let their hair down and beat the heat. The ladies were dressed in chic outfits and upped the fashion ante of the party. Pari, in an animal-print dress was the cynosure of all eyes. She carried off the look in style and ensured that she wore accessories that went well with her dress. Pavithra kept things simple, yet looked ravishing, sporting an orange-coloured top and a pair of black skinnies. Others like Priyanka and Cassandra were in attention-grabbing black dresses. Spotted among the city partygoers were expats like Jana and Josephine, who were seen enjoying themselves.
