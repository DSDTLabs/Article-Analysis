 Actor Ali Fazal, who belongs to Lucknow, said, "It is the first day of the shoot and I am really excited to be joining the Milan Talkies team in my hometown. A lot of new things will be happening for the first time for all of us. I am working with Shraddha in her first Bollywood film. It feels very weird to be shooting in Lucknow. I've lived here, known these gullies, mohallas all my life, and I never thought I will be shooting here. It feels good." 
 Shraddha, who makes her Bollywood debut with this film, reached the city ahead of the shoot and said, "I am very nervous. This is a new industry for me because I come from the South and I don’t know the way things work here but I think it is going to be great. I am very happy and proud to be working with some amazing names. I couldn’t have had a better start to my Bollywood career."
