LUCKNOW: On a day when the UP legislative council directed the Yogi government to seek a   probe into two cases of police encounters, director general of police OP   on Tuesday dismissed allegations that cops were targeting innocents. 

 Describing these encounters as state-wide police crackdown on wanted listed criminals, he said the police were not sitting ducks and would adopt a “bulletfor-bullet” approach in handling hardened criminals. He told   in his first media interview after assuming the charge of DGP that police will not fire the first shot. 
 
 However, he also emphasised, “No one should expect the police to take the bullet and sit back because that will not help to control crime and criminals in any manner. It will be a bullet for a bullet.” Singh expressed reservation over the term ‘encounter’, saying: “I will not like to call them encounters. They are a part of the crackdown against criminals.” 
 
 Talking about cow vigilantes and moral policing, he said no one would be allowed to take law into their hands. About the communal violence in   where one Chandan   was killed after the two communities came face to face following a dispute over taking out a Tiranga Yatra, Singh said it all started with a group clash and the rest was under investigation. 
 
 Emphasising on free registration of cases, the state police chief said, down the line the instructions are that all complaints must be registered. “We are aware that such an approach will lead to a sharp increase in crime statistics, but so be it,” he said.
