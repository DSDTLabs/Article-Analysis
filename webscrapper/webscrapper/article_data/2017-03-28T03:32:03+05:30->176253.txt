INDORE: The   on Monday issued notices to three   of the city for allegedly encroaching upon government land near   and violating land use norms by running   in area  

 The notices were issued to Madhya Pradesh Lawn Tennis Association, District Table Tennis Association and Corporation Basketball Association. The petition, filed by Piyush Jain through advocate Manohar Dalal, seeks demolition of encroachments on government land and directions to stop the private and commercial use of the land which had been given to these associations at subsidized rates for sports purposes.
 
 Division bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice Vivek Rusia granted two weeks to the respondents to file their reply. Apart from the three associations, chief secretary of state government, district collector, nazul officer and IMC commissioner have also been pleaded as respondents and have been granted two weeks to submit their reply.
 
 “Land has been granted to these associations at lease rent as cheap as Rs 3 per annum and they are generating commercial business through concerts, sales and exhibitions and giving space on rent. The lawn tennis club run by Anil Dhupar also has a liquor license at its name, whose purpose for a sports association is difficult to understand,” Manohar Dalal, petitioner’s advocate said.
 
 The petitioner has also alleged the encroachment of government land by these associations.
 
 “Basketball association run by Abhay Chhajlani has even encroached on the back lane of MG Road. A building resembling a hotel has been built behind Abhay Prashal, which is outside the limits of the land allotted to the associations,” Dalal added.
