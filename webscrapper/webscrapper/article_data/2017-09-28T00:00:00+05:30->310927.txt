While there is speculation that director   will be working once again with   for his next, we can confirm that he has roped in   for his next project, which will be a rural thriller.

 “Yes, my next film is with Atharvaa, and it is titled Oru Jeevan Azhaithathu. Atharvaa plays a college student in this film, which is set in a small-town setting, and takes place in and around Trichy township. Generally, thrillers are set in the city, and there have been a few horror films set in villages. So, a thriller happening in a rural area will be new to audiences,” says the director, who is now currently finalising the rest of the cast and crew. He adds that he is currently looking for a dusky actress to play the heroine. The launch puja of the film is slated for tomorrow. 
 
 The director also informs that he will be working on a film with his find, Vijay Sethupathi, again, once he completes this project.
