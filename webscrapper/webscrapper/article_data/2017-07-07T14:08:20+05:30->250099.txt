PUNE: The elected members of the NCP in Pune Municipal Corporation on Thursday claimed the city   was inviting chief minister to inaugurate   works, a day after Ajit Pawar asked party leaders to be aggressive on   issues.

 Leader of opposition and NCP corporator Chetan Tupe told reporters that the administration had established the Smart City Project’s control room at a building on Sinhagad Road reserved for the vegetable market. He also alleged the garbage processing plant planned at Ramtekdi had not received the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board’s (MPCB) nod. “Both works are likely to be inaugurated by CM Devendra Fadnavis. How can he support such illegal works?” Tupe asked.
 
 The NCP also targeted the BJP saying there was no dialogue with the opposition leaders, which was a wrong practice. He said, “Mayor and other leaders are not consulting us on crucial decisions. We have learnt that the PMC has received MPCB’s nod for the garbage project to be commenced at Uruli Devachi. But the BJP leaders and the administration are planning to utilize this nod for a project at Ramtekdi.”
 
 Tupe targeted the BJP leaders over their silence on illegally grabbing PMC lands, too. “The PMC-owned plots in the city are being grabbed. BJP leaders are silent over this issue and should explain the intentions for not opposing the land-grabbing,” Tupe said.
