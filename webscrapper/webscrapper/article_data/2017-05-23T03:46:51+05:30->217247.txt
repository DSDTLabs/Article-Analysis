NEW DELHI: Union home secretary   on Monday said the alleged threat to Kashmiris cracking various central services recruitment exams was “more hype than reality” and emanated out of Pakistan-inspired thinking that anything that has to do with Indian establishment must be brought down.

 “We should take pride in the fact that these Kashmiris, with no access to coaching and coming from an area where there is a lot more uncertainty than rest of India, did so well in these exams,” Mehrishi said adding that the threats to them were essentially a bid to challenge anything identified with the Indian establishment. “It is part of Pakistan’s strategy completely driven from  ,” he told TOI on the sidelines of release of his book ‘India 2017 Yearbook’, a learning aid for civil services aspirants.
 
 Mehrishi’s observations come in the wake of recent abduction and killing of Army officer from Kashmir, Lt  , in Shopian as well as BSF recruitment exam topper   allegedly expressing concerns regarding security of his Udhampur-based family. The home secretary also told TOI that coaching classes were not an ideal way to prepare for civil services or any other competitive exam as acquiring of knowledge must be sustained affair from an early age.
 
 “I have never been on any UPSC interview panel, but my colleagues tell me candidates tend to be like carbon copies, obviously coached at the institutes, and give the same answers to same questions,” he said. “Coaching is a bad way to prepare for any exam. Aspirants are forced into student’s life out of lack of a fully functional education system. You should be preparing for IAS/IPS from an early age. If you are studying for an engineering course and suddenly want to take an exam for IAS, you have to go to a coaching class,” he said.
