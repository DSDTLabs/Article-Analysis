CHENNAI: Investigators with the   (NIA), who are looking for possible links between   and   (IS), have made quiet visits to Chennai in the recent past to probe the  , which is allegedly funded by his banned   (IRF), which has assets worth 7.05 crore.

 The Centre had in November 2016 banned the IRF and the   (ED) attached properties of IRF, mostly in Mumbai and Chennai, valued at 18.37 crore.
 
 Naik was chairman of IRF Educational Trust and president of the Islamic Research Foundation in Mumbai, which runs Islamic International School on East Coast Road in the city.
 
 NIA has issued fresh summons for a second time to Naik to appear before investigators regarding foreign funds directed to the non-governmental organisation.
 
 Officers said they could not, during the probe, speak about the discoveries they have made in Chennai.
 
 "It is routine to monitor the activities of a suspect in such a case," an investigating officer said. But the agency is keen to make a breakthrough in the investigation of the activities of Naik - who they suspect to have influenced youngsters to join IS - after failing to make headway in the case it filed against him last year.
 
 Indian security agencies put Naik under the lens after at least one suspect in a deadly cafe attack in the Bangladesh capital of Dhaka last July said the televangelist's speeches inspired him.
 
 Naik, who security agencies say is in Saudi Arabia, is suspected of "promoting enmity between groups on religious grounds", an NIA officer said.
 Efforts to reach school management proved futile.
