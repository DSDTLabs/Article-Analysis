AHMEDABAD: Buying a new   has become a   with the husband stubbornly refusing to buy a new one, and the wife reluctant to return to her   without it.

 The differences between the couple from Shaherkotda went to such a level that all efforts at reaching a compromise failed over the issue of a pressure cooker. The husband rejected even the court’s suggestion to buy a new pressure cooker for his wife.
 
 The additional metropolitan magistrate, upon coming to know that the husband earns well as an insurance agent, insisted that he buy a new cooker by the evening and end the issue. The man refused and told the court that he does not earn enough to afford a new pressure cooker.
 
 The issue of purchase of a new pressure cooker came to light after the woman mentioned it as a major argument for proving harassment in her complaint filed under the Domestic Violence Act. Her main grievance was that her husband returns home from work very late at night. The husband did not want to compromise with working hours too, said the  .
 
 The couple had a love marriage in 2012, but due to small differences the woman’s husband and in-laws did not bring the woman home after she gave birth to a child three years ago. 
 
 In her complaint, the woman has mentioned that the husband has not been purchasing a new pressure cooker since beginning of their married life. The husband, on the other hand, asserted that there are three pressure cookers at his home. His wife can manage with them and there is no need to buy a new cooker.
