CHENNAI: Memorials are raised in praise and memory of leaders who spent their life for public cause, and not for persons convicted by courts, claimed  , who has approached the   seeking to restrain the Tamil Nadu government from constructing memorial to former chief minister J Jayalalithaa utilising government funds. 

 Admitting the public interest litigation (PIL) petition, a division bench headed by Justice M Sathyanarayanan ordered notice to the government and the Chennai corporation, returnable by August 18. “The state has raised memorials for former chief ministers like K Kamaraj and C N Annadurai. But Jayalalithaa cannot be included on the list since she went to jail not for public cause but for indulging in the corrupt practice of looting Tamil Nadu of Rs 53 crore,” Duraisamy said.
 
 Adding that such people had no right to be celebrated and honoured by the state, the petitioner said if her followers wanted to raise a memorial irrespective of what she had done for the people they could do it with their own money in their own place. Claiming that even the existing memorial for former chief minister M G Ramachandran was built without obtaining any approval from the authorities concerned, the advocate said the Chennai Corporation could not grant any such permission for Jayalalithaa’s memorial in the absence of elected counsellors. The petitioner also alleged that the body of Jayalalithaa was buried in utter violation of the rules and regulations and against the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 which has declared coastal stretches as Coastal Regulation Zone. Referring to provisions of Madras Corporation and Municipal Council Act which says that no person shall bury, burn or otherwise dispose of any corpse except in a place which has been registered, licensed or provided for the purpose, the petitioner claimed that the government has buried the former CM’s body in total violation of laws.
