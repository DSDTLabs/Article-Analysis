BHOPAL: The   government decided on Tuesday to ban plastic and polythene bags across the state from May 1, saying it is leading to cow deaths and polluting the environment.

 However, the government didn’t specify if plastic bags of a certain thickness will be allowed, triggering confusion among manufacturers.
 
 The   government had on January 1 declared tourist destinations and holy cities in MP polythene-free. Environmentalists have hailed the ban.
 
 “The state cabinet expressed concern over increasing use of polythene carry bags and their consumption in large number by the cattle resulting in their deaths. It was unanimously decided to ban polythene bags across the state from May 1,” said legislative affairs and public relations minister Narottam Mishra.
 
 On Republic Day, the CM had announced a total ban on polythene from May 1. The cabinet decision came in view of directives issued by the   during hearing of a case filed by an environmentalist.
 
 When TOI spoke to a senior official of the pollution control board — the agency that will enforce the ban — he was clueless on whether only thin polythene bags were banned. “We are yet to get the order,” he said.
