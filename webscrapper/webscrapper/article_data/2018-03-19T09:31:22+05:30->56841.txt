THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A day after BJP leaders met   in Kottayam, party state president   himself has made an announcement welcoming the   (Mani) chief to the NDA fold.

 Rajasekharan said those who accept the policies and vision of NDA could be a part of the front in the wake of the Chengannur bypoll expected in May. “If Mani takes a favourable stand, we will not hesitate to have talks with him. All NDA constituents will sit and decide on this,” he said.
 
 BJP former state president   and others had met Mani the other day. The discussion assumed greater significance as it took place ahead of the steering committee meeting of Kerala Congress (Mani) on Sunday.
 
 He also expressed hope that the difference of opinion with ally   would be settled before the bypoll. “The neutral votes would be the deciding factor in the byelection. It is not the CPM’s victory over UDF corruption and anti-people polices but the neutral mindset of the people that had led to the latter’s rout in assembly polls. Now, public will give their verdict on the   government,” he said.
