AHMEDABAD: Himanshu Kalia, called the ‘ambulance man’ of Delhi for his   in the capital and nearby areas, is in Gujarat on March 4 and 5 to promote the concept of free ambulances and prepare a directory of 15 lakh blood donors across the country. Kalia and his wife Twinkle, considered to be the country’s first woman ambulance driver, visited   on Sunday and informed citizens about their initiative.

 “I was 14 years old when I lost my father due to lack of such ambulance services. A decade later, when I was getting married, I asked for an ambulance in dowry instead of a car and started my free service. My dream is to operate 1,500 ambulances across the country,” said Kalia.
 
  He said that Gujarat has a good ambulance services in place but more ambulances might reduce the response time. 
 
 “My family and I are encouraging people of Ahmedabad to enrol in our mission as blood donors. One might be aware of the recent news where a three-year-old girl in Delhi died due to lack of blood. The directory of 15 lakh donors across the country is my attempt to create a situation where families in crisis will not have to run from pillar to post to identify the suitable donors,” Kalia said., adding that they are getting good response from the city.
 
 He and his team has already conducted similar activities in cities including Hyderabad, Jaipur and Chandigarh in the past.
