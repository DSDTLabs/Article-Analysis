BAREILLY: Samajwadi Party leader and former state minister Azam Khan, taking a dig at BJP, said that as voting in   assembly elections was now over, MA  , over whose portrait at   a row had erupted, would no longer be an issue.
 
  “During Karnataka elections, BJP didn’t have any issue to fan sentiments for polarisation of votes. That is why they exhumed Jinnah from the grave by taking up the issue of his portrait. Now the elections are over and Jinnah will also be sent back to his grave,” Khan said.
  
  The SP leader added, “Peace and harmony have been spoiled completely in the country since BJP came to power. It has only one motto. Win the elections one after one even at the cost of people’s lives. When they found nothing to communalise the Karnataka assembly elections, they came up with the unnecessary issue of Jinnah’s portrait in AMU.”
  
  
  
  Khan also launched a scathing attack on visits to Dalits’ home by BJP ministers. “I am also planning to visit a Dalit’s home very soon. I will eat and drink from the same utensils what are used by them (a   family),” he added.
  
  
  
  Attacking Prime Minister   and chief minister Yogi Adityanath, Khan said that both were religious persons and they should perform functions only inside temples.
  
  
  
  “These persons are good for only temples. It will be greatest service to nation, if both of them stay and perform services inside temples only,” Khan added.
