Aurangabad: When two women, aged 25 and 23, stricken with bone cancer of the knees, were wheeled into the   (GMCH) here, amputation of the leg seemed to be the convenient way to rid them of cancer but doctors at the hospital went out of their way to save their limbs by performing a rare surgery. 

 Usha Sanjay Vadhekar, 25, a resident of Aashti Tehsil in   and Shivkanya Vyankat, 23, a resident of Nilanga in   both had their knees swollen and complained of excruciating pain. Following preliminary investigation, they were diagnosed with giant cell of tumour proximal tibia. The private practitioners they had consulted had suggested amputation of the affected limb, the cost of which was estimated between Rs 2 lakh and 3 lakh.
 
 The patients were not financially able to bear the expenses. Subsequently, they approached GMCH and we admitted them at the orthopaedic ward, head of department of orthopaedics at the hospital Chandrakant Thorat told TOI.
 
 After biopsy we could confirm the diagnosis of locally aggressive giant cell tumour ( ) of bone in both cases, Thorat said. Doctors at the state-run hospital studied the cases and gave them the assurance that the amputation can be avoided and their condition will be treated through surgical procedure.
 
 “This cancer is rare and constitutes only 2% of cases related to bone cancer. The surgery required for its treatment required excision of bone tumour with fixation of custom-made nail and fibular bone grafting and is therefore also rare and complex,” Thorat said.
 
 Usha was discharged earlier while Shivkanya is still in hospital and will be discharged in a few days. I feel better, there is no pain now, Shivkanya told TOI. Their treating doctor confirmed that both patients registered good recovery after the surgery.
 
 The treatment provided at the government hospital to the women saved them the pain of going to Pune or Mumbai. GMCH dean Kanan Yelikar appreciated the efforts of Thorat and his team.
