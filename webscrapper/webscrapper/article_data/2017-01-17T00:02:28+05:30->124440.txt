Nagpur: The uncharted territory of private pre-primary education is slowly being ushered into the regulatory zone by the NCPCR.

 The commissioner has issued guidelines to monitor   and make them accountable considering the safety of children being at stake.
 
 NCPCR member Priyank Kanoongo said, “The guidelines cover a wide array of issues. For long, the pre-primary sectors have been on autopilot but we have decided it won’t be so anymore. We have prepared detailed guidelines and clearly defined what would constitute a playschool and related establishments. In fact, our guidelines are so detailed that the state simply has to implement them without worrying about preparing an exhaustive checklist.”
 
 NCPCR had sent the guidelines to Maharashtra government last month. “We hope that these guidelines are implemented as soon as possible so that the kids will be benefited. As of now, Himachal Pradesh is moving fast on this and it will be coming out with a notification,” said Kanoongo.
 
 He said it is up to the state to decide which ministry it will allocate this task to.
 
 “We come in to the picture for monitoring of the process whereas the actual implementation will have to be done by the state government only,” said Kanoongo.
