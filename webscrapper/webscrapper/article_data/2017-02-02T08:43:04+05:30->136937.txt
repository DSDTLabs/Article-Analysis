BHUBANESWAR:   Arun Jaitley's budget on Wednesday raised hopes of duped investors of   as he assured introduction of   and Protection of Depositors Interests Act soon. A draft bill to curtail the menace of illicit deposit schemes has been placed in public domain and will be introduced shortly after its finalisation. "There is an urgent need to protect the poor and gullible investors from dubious schemes," Jaitley said in his budget speech. 

 Though the state government already formulated a law, Odisha Protection of Interests of Depositors (in financial establishments) Act 2011, not a single investor has so far got any benefit under the Act. Notwithstanding provisions in the Act about auction of assets of the chit fund companies and equal distribution of the money raised from the auction process among investors, the government is yet to give money to the victims, said lawyer Siddharth Das.
