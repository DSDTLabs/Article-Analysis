GURGAON: If the frequent   weren’t bad enough, residents now have to deal with  , which is having an adverse effect on their home appliances like air conditioners, refrigerators and microwave ovens.

 On Tuesday, TOI received reports of frequent voltage fluctuations from various parts of the city — Sector 14, Sector 10, South City-1 and even Udyog Vihar Phase-3 that has only corporate houses.
 
 “Around 10 am, light started dimming and glowing. There weren’t power cuts. Our refrigerator made hoarse sounds while the rice cooker failed to heat up. I was scared and turned off my AC. Even in this heat, I thought of leaving late for office as without   it was impossible to stay at home,” said  , a resident of Sector 10A.
 
 Residents of Sector 14 said voltage fluctuation had been frequent for the past couple of weeks, but it recently abated. 
 
 The reports of fluctuations came from Udyog Vihar Phase-3 too. 
 
 However, superintending engineer Naveen Verma denied reports of city-wide fluctuations. “There mustn’t have been any common pattern in these. Such fluctuations are mostly individual cases. They are plenty of reasons for them. Only when we check and go through the connections, then we can accurately say why it had happened,” he said.
