MUMBAI:   previous chairman   issued a statement on Thursday, hitting back at  , the managing trustee of  , saying his “alleged actions, which are today under ( ) investigation, raise grave public concerns over his credibility and ability to be the custodian of India’s largest public charitable trust”.

 
 The CBI on Tuesday searched the offices of   — a joint venture between Malaysia’s budget airline and Tata Sons — and Venkataramanan’s residence in the city, and subsequently filed an FIR alleging wrongdoings including bribery, corruption and violation of civil aviation norms. The next day, Venkat blamed Mistry for the accusations and claimed that he — as a non-executive director — had little or no role to play in AirAsia India.
 
 Mistry said, “It is well documented that (Venkataramanan) was intimately involved in the affairs of AirAsia India right from its inception. He has had many roles, including that of executive assistant to Ratan Tata at the time of the formation of the company, Tata Sons’ nominee on the board, as well as that of a shareholder with a 1.5% stake in the company. Therefore, his weak excuse that he was only a non-executive director without any responsibility is totally without any merit.”
 
 “This ridiculous attempt to question the independence of the CBI and to cloak his alleged misadventures by using my name is treated with the contempt it deserves,” Mistry added. He said that it was very disturbing that a “few individuals with alleged questionable motives are today bringing disrepute to the Tata brand”. Mistry’s family has been associated with the 150-year-old Tata Group for 90 years. Mistry said, “Tata Sons board and Tata Trusts’ trustees need to concern themselves over the decline in governance standards at AirAsia India that this shameful case reveals. The actions or lack thereof that (they) may take will define their commitment to upholding the value system enshrined by the group’s founders.”
