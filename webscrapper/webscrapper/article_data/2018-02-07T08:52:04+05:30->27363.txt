PANAJI: Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) leader and PWD minister Ramakrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar on Tuesday said that carnival is not part of Goan culture and its celebrations had also been earlier halted for this reason by other Goan leaders like Wilfred de Souza.

 Dhavalikar, however, said that he will not interfere with decisions taken by his party colleague   ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar in his capacity as tourism minister. Azgaonkar had earlier announced holding of the carnival parade in  , where it was not usually held.
 
 “It is not our culture. But Azgaonkar has taken decisions as tourism minister. MGP doesn’t want to get involved in such government matters,” he said, speaking to reporters after MGP’s central party committee meet.
