CHENNAI: Spelling trouble for the multi-lingual mega-budget film '
 ', expected to hit screens on April 28, a   has approached   for a stay on the   in   due to unpaid amounting to Rs 1.18 crore. 

 The Chennai-based ACE Media, in its civil suit against M S Sharavanan of Sri Green Productions, said the latter had the exhibition rights of the Tamil movie within the state. In January 2017, he approached ACE for loan, which should be paid to M/s Prabhu Deva Studio Pvt Ltd, on the promise that he would return the amount along with an additional sum of Rs 10 lakh before the release of 'Baahubali 2'.
 
 To his surprise, the ACE Media proprietor saw Sharavanan trying to sell theatrical exhibition rights to third parties and negotiations were done on April 9, when the film's music released. When asked, he was informed that the amount would be returned after the release of the movie. Calling it "contrary to the terms of agreement dated February 1, 2017," ACE said its inquiries revealed the debtor had no intention of returning the money and that he was colluding with third parties to release the film in the name of third parties.
 
 The applicant sought stay on distribution, exhibition and release of 'Baahubali 2' in any form anywhere in Tamil Nadu without settling the dues. The suit is scheduled to come up before Justice K Kalyanasundaram for hearing on Thursday.
