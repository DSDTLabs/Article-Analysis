AHMEDABAD: Minister of state, home,   said in the state assembly that the E-challan system which had taken a break since January will again start functioning in urban areas from April 15.

 Referring to the system Jadeja said, “There was some technical issues which have been resolved, and it will soon begin in urban areas of the state.”
  
 The state government’s e-challan project, already rolled out to four major cities — Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot — along with other cities such as Gandhinagar, Bhavnagar and   had in December 2017, stopped with the announcement of its temporary discontinuation till completion of Smart Cities project.
 
 Officials said that there were several crossroads in the state where the government was yet to install CCTV cameras and hence the project was put on hold. The officials said that now that almost all the places have CCTV cameras e-challans will begin anew. These cameras were installed under the Smart city project.
 
 Jadeja had earlier said that the decision had been taken after the CM received a number of complaints by citizens of receiving wrong e-challans. He had said that the system is already in place for automatic and manual e-challans on basis of CCTV footage. Soon after the announcement, the home department asked the state police not to generate e-challans from January 13 till infrastructure and system is in place.
 
 State government officials said that installation of cameras under City Surveillance and Intelligent Traffic Management System (CSITMS) was complete, and now e-challans will start again. City police had earlier in its report submitted to the state government that only 2.8% of those who paid the e-challans, issued at the rate of about 6,000 challans per day at peak capacity, had filed complaints. Complaints ranged from wrong number of vehicle, wrong offence mentioned, duplicate challans and unclear photographs. However, only 20% of challans had been paid.
