VADODARA: The   ( ) has now set its eyes on razing Ektanagar on Ajwa Road in the city. The settlement has around 1,850 houses and these include those for which allotment letters were given by the government earlier.

 The razing of Ektanagar has been mired in a row since late last year when the residents who had allotment letters moved the   high court with support of the   (AAP). The high court asked VMC not to raze the premises of the allottees who have not given consent rehabilitation.
 
 VMC officials, however, said that only a couple of original allottees were now staying in Ektanagar. The rest have either sold or rented their premises to others. This in VMCâ€™s opinion is a clear violation of the conditions of allotment of land to the beneficiaries.
 
 VMC commissioner Dr   said that several persons had given undertakings to vacate their homes by June 30. The VMC may take up the razing of those houses for which such undertakings were not given, if it is feasible presently.
