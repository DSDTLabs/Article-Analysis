Gandhinagar: Upset with the poor quality of drainage work and dangerously dug-up roads in several municipality and corporation areas of the state, chief minister Vijay Rupani during the cabinet meeting on Wednesday told the ministers to personally monitor the ongoing drainage and road works in their respective constituencies. 

 The chief minister said that he had been receiving several complaints from people against the poor quality of work and slow pace of drainage construction leading to dug-up patches in several areas of the state. According to sources, he expressed his anguish over bad condition of roads causing accidents, traffic jams etc. He told the ministers to personally address all such complaints. He directed officials of the urban development department to immediately take up the issue and complete all such pending works across the state before monsoon. Similar instructions were given to the officials of road & building department. When some officials raised the issue of non-availability of funds, the CM asked them to immediately utilize the Rs10 lakh allocated to every municipality and mobilised more funds for the purpose.
 
 Rupani reportedly clarified that post-monsoon the government will not find time to finish these development works as by August end or early September, the model election code of conduct is likely to come into force.
 
 Compared to rural areas, BJP is banking high on the urban areas to sail through in the upcoming assembly elections. In November 2015, the party badly lost in district and taluka panchayats elections. However, it won all the municipal corporations and most of the municipalities. 
 
 According to experts, Rupani is trying hard to consolidate the partyâ€™s position in urban areas by finishing all pending works before the announcement of poll dates so that the urban voters continue to support the party.
