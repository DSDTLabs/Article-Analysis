PATNA: The   is causing inconvenience to the residents of several localities as the silt taken out from the drains has been dumped on the roads and left unattended by the   (PMC) officials. 

 Those driving their vehicles either attempt to squeeze into the cleaner space left on the road or divert their routes. Stench, lack of space for pedestrians, unhygienic surrounding and long traffic jams cause inconvenience to locals. 
 
 Local   pointed out that traffic issues have increased due to the ongoing drainage cleaning works. “We get stuck in traffic jams and battle the stench around since silt occupies major portion of the road,” said Vaishali Rai, who commutes through   road, which has heaps of garbage all through. She said the authorities concerned are doing nothing to remove the silt taken out from the Mandiri drain around a week back.
 
 PMC deputy municipal commissioner Vishal Anand said, “The silt taken out from the drains is in semi-liquid state. In order to smoothen its transport, we wait for around 48-72 hours for the semi-liquid waste to completely dry, depending on the amount of silt. Strict instructions have been given to all the assigned officers for removing the silt within the given time period. If any officer fails to do so, he will be liable for departmental investigation and actions.”
 
 Anand said the area-wise drainage cleaning work began in the first week of April and is expected to get over by June 15. “The deadline will not be extended any further,” he added.
 
 The desilting of drainage is an annual exercise conducted by PMC ahead of monsoon season to ensure that rainwater flows smoothly down the drains during rainy season.
 
 “Pedestrians face the major problem as they can barely walk on the roads half occupied by the silt and the rest congested by the vehicles,” said Abhinav Kumar of Ashiana Nagar.
