HYDERABAD: The  's (GHMC) south zone, which covers Old City and large parts of  , is finding it difficult to identify suitable land parcels to construct some of the sanctioned model markets. 

 The model markets are a part of the 100 day action plan, a project envisioned by  , minister for   and Urban Development. It seeks the construction of these markets, need for providing better roads and protection of land parcels, among other civic facilities and amenities. According to data obtained by MA Akram, an RTI activist, model markets in the south zone were sanctioned on March 3, 2015 near Midhani, Lalithabagh, near Peeli Dargah in Barkas, Aram Ghar Crossroads in Attapur and at the LIC bus stop in Saidabad. 
 
 A GHMC official who did not wish to be identified said, "While some markets such as those in Rajendra Nagar and the one near Peeli Dargah are complete and are awaiting inauguration, we are unable to find more space to construct others. We are scouting for locations which are on the main roads or at least close to the main roads so that there can be greater footfall. But the exercise is proving to be difficult for us." 
 
 Data showed that so far, the civic body has spent over 93 lakh for the construction of several of these markets. When contacted, Srinivas Rao, zonal commissioner (south) said that 10 model markets have been sanctioned for the south zone. While work on some is complete, the others are in various 'stages of completion'. 
 
 Confirming that GHMC is is looking for suitable land parcels to construct three other model markets and that it is facing some difficulty in identifying land parcels, he said, "While it is true that we are finding it difficult to locate lands for construction of other model markets which have been sanctioned, the problem can be handled. In fact, we have already auctioned eight shops at the Rajendra Nagar only yesterday and the other eight are in the process of being auctioned."
