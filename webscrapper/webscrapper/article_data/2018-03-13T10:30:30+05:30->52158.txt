TRICHY: Over hundred two-wheeler riders took out a rally towards the district collector office in   to submit a petition demanding to withdraw all the cases filed against the agitators who blocked road in Thiruverumber opposing the act of the traffic inspector, who kicked a bike, leading to the woman’s death. 

 They also condemned the police action against some youths for not wearing helmet near   last week and urged the district collector to instruct the police to withdraw cases booked against them.
 
 Protesters alleged that some policemen take dangerous methods to stop bikers for vehicle checks. They just barge in front of the bikes in the middle of the road - forcing motorists to hit on the brakes hard, or attacking the rider on the head or back with a lathi or inserting it into the wheels, they added.
 
 The district president of   MP   alleged that the police were fixing targets for imposing fines on those riding without helmets. They insisted that should be stopped. “Police officers have a fixed target to those in lower ranks. They are forced to catch violators and resort to violence to stop the motorists,” he alleged.
