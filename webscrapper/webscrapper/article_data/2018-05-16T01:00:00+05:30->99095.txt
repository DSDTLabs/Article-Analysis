A prominent social club recently organised a Shaam-E-Awadh theme based party for its members. The male members of the club came dressed in achkans while the fairer sex chose to be dressed in shararas. Nidhi, one of the key organisers, and her husband  , were seen interacting with the guests.

 The venue was beautifully decorated with huge candle stands, mirrors, hookahs and lamps that gave a perfect   look to the party. We spotted Nitin, Neha, Susheel, and Rashmi having a quality time at the do.
 The highlight of the evening was a dance by the performers that kept the guests entertained during the do. Parul was seen happy as she received a lot of compliments for her dressing. Dinesh and Divyani were seen enjoying hookah.
