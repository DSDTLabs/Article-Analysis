JAIPUR: After lagging behind in constructing homes under  , the   has now relaxed norms to allow third parties to execute work on request from beneficiaries.

 As per the provision, the owners of sanctioned units had the first right to construct their homes as daily wage labourers up to a period of 90 days. The payment to them was also linked with MGNREGA funds.
 
 However, it has been observed that construction of more than one lakh homes have been pending. In most cases, the beneficiaries were either old or handicapped to carry out construction work.
 
 “Persons who are 60 years and above, physically challenged and not able to work or monitor the construction work can give it in writing and the construction of their homes will be given to an authorized agency,” said an official.
 
 “The payment in such cases will not go to the accounts of beneficiaries but will be instead transferred to panchayat samitis,” added the official.
 
 A letter has also been issued by additional chief secretary Sudarshan Sethi to the CEO’s of zila parishads. The state government is aiming to complete as many homes as possible before March 2017.
