By allocating a staggering Rs 11,717 crore for social welfare programmes, chief minister   has adroitly used the budget to address caste politics — many sops have been offered to the Ahinda (acronym for dalits, backward classes and minorities) vote bank in the run-up to the 2018 assembly polls. The outlay was Rs 9,341 crore in 2016-2017.

 While Rs 6,363 crore has been earmarked for the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), Rs 3,154 crore has been set aside for backward classes, including the Kuruba community. A total of Rs 2,200 crore has gone to the minorities (mostly Muslims).
 
 While Siddaramaiah has increased diet charges for pre-matric and post-matric SC and ST students staying in hostels to Rs 1,400 and Rs 1,500 per month respectively, what will have a greater connect is his decision to allocate Rs 100 crore towards giving LPG connections to two lakh SC and ST families.
 
 For professionally qualified SC and ST unemployed youth, he has extended 50% subsidy to start self-employment units at a cost of Rs 5 lakh each. A total of Rs 300 crore has been earmarked to distribute buffalo, cow and sheep to one lakh SC and ST families by offering Rs 25,000 subsidy and Rs 15,000 loan at 4% interest. A grant of Rs 200 crore has been proposed for the overall development of over 13 tribal communities.
 
 Sources in the Congress said SC and ST communities constitute 24% of the state’s population and it is politically pertinent to woo this major vote bank.
 
 To encourage students from minority communities to pursue higher education, a one-time incentive of Rs 2 lakh each for students from the communities who join national institutions like IIMs, IITs and IISc has been proposed. The government also plans to roll out a programme similar to the Kerala model of creating self-employment opportunities for youth returning from Gulf countries.
 
 The monthly allowance for law graduates from backward classes and SCs/STs has been hiked to Rs 4,000 and Rs 5,000 a month respectively.
 
 The government has also announced Rs 3 lakh incentive for widows from SC/ST communities when they remarry.
