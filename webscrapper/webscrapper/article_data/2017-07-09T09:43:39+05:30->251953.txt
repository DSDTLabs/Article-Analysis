CHENNAI:   (ATK) may rope in former Irish striker   as their marquee player for the forthcoming edition of the   ( ). It’s understood that ATK’s new coach  , who will be unveiled soon, wants Keane on board. As reported by The Irish Sun on Saturday, the 37-year-old also has offers from several English and Australian clubs, including  , but the striker is likely to join  .

 Kerala Blasters were also in the fray to sign the forward, who left Major League Soccer (MLS) outfit Los Angeles Galaxy in January this year. “Keane is currently a free agent. So the ISL clubs don’t need to dole out a lot of money to secure his services. Keane, though, is assessing his options as he has offers from a lot of second-tier English clubs,” a source close to the developments told TOI on Saturday.
 
 When contacted by TOI, ATK’s principal owner Sanjiv Goenka didn’t react on the issue. “At the present moment, we are not in a position to comment. Nothing has been finalized so we would like to avoid all speculations,” an ATK spokesperson said.
 
 Keane retired from international football last year after scoring 68 goals — the highest by an Irishman — in 146 appearances. While he was key player for his national side, Keane has also donned the jerseys of big clubs like Inter Milan, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur. Keane had been staying in shape by training with Shamrock Rovers over the past few months.
