CHENNAI:   working president M K   on Wednesday endorsed West Bengal chief minister  's attempt to unite regional parties across the country against the "undemocratic BJP government" at the Centre. 

 "DMK has always stood for the unity of regional parties and stronger federal co-operation. I endorse the efforts of @mamataOfficial to bring together various political parties to oppose the autocratic and anti-democratic rule of the BJP," Stalin tweeted on Wednesday. 
 
 Stalin's tweet soon created a buzz on social media. Opinions and questions varied from - what happens to DMK's alliance with Congress, to DMK dumps Congress, to such an attempt to form a third front without Congress will only help BJP retain power at the Centre. These were widely shared on social media. By the evening,   Banerjee too thanked Stalin for his endorsement. "Thank you. We extend our full support," she tweeted. Neither Stalin nor Mamata, however, mentioned anything about Congress in these tweets.
