BHUBANESWAR:   in ward no. 53 has become the first slum in the   to be declared   (ODF). To celebrate it, the   (BMC) organised   (walk of pride) with mayor Ananta Narayan Jena leading it. 

 The ODF status came to the slum a month after the BMC carried out a massive campaign to make people aware of the ill-effects of open defecation. The slum has 30 households, according to BMC sources. 
 
 "It is a matter of pride for us as the city is inching towards being completely free of open defecation. The example of ward no. 53 will inspire others," said Jena. 
 
 The ward comes under the Bhubaneswar Town Centre District (BTCD), which is a demarcated area for redevelopment under Smart City. There are 24 slums in BTDC area. " In the next few months, we will double our efforts to make the entire city free from open defecation," added the mayor. 
 
 On May 10, the BMC's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan cell formed a squad called Banar Sena comprising 20 children (10 children in each group of two) to launch door-to-door campaign and convince each member of the slum household in BTCD area to use bathrooms. 
 
 Feedback Foundation, a private agency engaged by Bhubaneswar Smart City Limited (BSCL), which is monitoring the open defecation free movement in the city trained the children on how to interact with the people and check open defecation. 
 
 While one group sets out on mission open defecation free in the morning, the other group launches the campaign in the evening. 
 
 The Nigrani committee (surveillance squad) in Kalinga Basti comprised mostly women, who ran the campaign for ODF. With the help of Feedback Foundation, the women squad also recommended modifications of the toilets that exist in the slums.
