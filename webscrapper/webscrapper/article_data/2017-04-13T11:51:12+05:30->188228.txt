CHANDIGARH: Standoff between agitating employees of   and state transport department over issuance of permits to private operators intensified on Wednesday as government placed under suspension 120 leaders and members of roadways employees unions. Meanwhile, nearly 4,200 buses remained off road for the third day on Wednesday. Adding more to the woes of commuters, private operators joined the strike in Rohtak, Jhajjar, Hisar, Sirsa, Fatehabad, Jind and Panipat districts.

 As the fourth round of talks between the transport minister   and the roadways employees union leaders failed in Panchkula, the transport department and the government had started planning to minimize the impact of the strike.
 
 Additional chief secretary (transport) S S Dhillon termed the strike as unjustified saying, “The government has already accepted majority of the demands. We appeal to the employees to get back to work so that the passengers are not harassed.”
 
 Dhillon denied any such move, the sources in the government hinted at a tough action like invoking the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) 1968 in the state. “We are open to talks with the employee union leaders,” said Dhillon.
 
 Sources informed that the government has also called a meeting of the crisis management group on Thursday before proceeding further in the matter. The group includes ministers and bureaucrats.
 
 Those placed under suspension are spearheading the agitations at 19 depots of Haryana Roadways across the state. Subhash lamba, general secretary of the  , termed the suspension of employees as dictatorial attitude of the state government.
 
 “This is dictatorship and the government is trying to suppress the voice of the employees. We will not give up. We are agitating for the common men. We are forcing the government to add the new buses. We demand the government to rollback its decision of issuing permits to private operators,” said Dalbir Singh Kirmara, president of Haryana Roadways Workers Union.
