AHMEDABAD: The Indian Railways has decided to exempt a few of its metre-gauge lines from being converted to broad gauge due to their tourism and heritage appeal, said sources in the ministry. 

 In  , the 50km stretch of metre-gauge line that runs through Gir Sanctuary will be preserved as a heritage line.
 
 According to sources, until now, only five such stretches have been identified that are not to be converted to broad gauge but maintained as heritage lines. These stretches fall in Madhya Pradesh,  , Uttar Pradesh,   and Gujarat.
 
 Most of these stretches may come to be used exclusively for tourism.
 
 The five stretches include the   rail line in Madhya Pradesh, Nanpara-Mailani stretch in Uttar Pradesh, Mahur-Harangajao stretch in Assam, Marwar-Udaipur in Rajasthan, and the metre-gauge line through Gir Sanctuary, in Gujarat.
 
 Most of these stretches pass through sanctuaries or tourist spots. The Mhow-Kalakund stretch passes through Vindhyachal mountains and by the Patalpani waterfall. The stretch in UP passes through Dudhwa National Park. 
 
 The Rajasthan stretch passes through the bio-diversity sanctuary of Todgarh Raoli, and the Assam stretch passes through the North Cachar hill district.
 
 The ministry is thinking of running special heritage and tourist trains on these stretches said sources.
