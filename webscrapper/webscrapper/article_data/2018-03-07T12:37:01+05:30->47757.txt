MADURAI: A 60-year-old farmer was attacked by a bear, when he was on his way to his field. The incident took place in   village located some four km away from Usilampatti on Monday evening.

 The farmer, identified as O Thangam, was rushed to the Government   (GRH). It was a fortunate escape for Thangam, as the bear left him after he fell down unconscious. Farmers from nearby lands came to his rescue and took him to a nearby hospital, from where he was referred to the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH). 
 
 When contacted, Madurai district forest officer J R Samartha confirmed that it was a bear attack. There is some good green forest cover in Sirumalai and   areas in Madurai. While bears are not spotted in Sirumalai, it is spotted at least once a year in Elumalai forest. In fact, this is the third time people have been attacked in Madurai in the last five years, he said. Thangam, who is undergoing treatment said, “The bear suddenly appeared from the bushes and caught hold of me. It started attacking me and I fell down unconscious.”
 
 Thangam’s wife T Karupayi said that they have their farmland adjacent to forest areas, where attack by wild animals is frequent. “While forest officials penalise us for erecting electric fencing to protect ourselves from wild boars etc, they have failed to act to save us from the animals,” she said.
