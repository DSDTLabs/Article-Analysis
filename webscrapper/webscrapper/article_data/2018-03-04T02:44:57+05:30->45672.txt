NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha Speaker   drew the attention of the   government towards   in place in  . In a   to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Mahajan suggested that MP could take a leaf out of Delhi government’s effort in making schools safe.

 On January 5, a speeding school bus of DPS rammed a truck at Indore’s Kanadiya bypass, killing four students and the driver. Six people were arrested for violations of laws related to maintenance of school buses.
 
 Mahajan, who represents Indore in Lok Sabha, wrote the letter against the backdrop of this accident two months ago. She wrote, “According to the information I have received, the School Education Department has been strictly implementing the law regarding (private) schools in Delhi. In case of violations, a strong provision has been made under which the government takes over and runs such schools,” while suggesting that if the chief minister considered it suitable, such rules and regulations could also be made for schools in MP.
 
 She said in the letter that the conduct of school bus drivers should be monitored and it should be ensured that they follow traffic rules.
 
 She also suggested that there should be different toilets for the younger and older students besides separate washrooms for the employees. CCTV cameras should be installed in every part of the school and police verification of its staff should be made mandatory, Mahajan said.
