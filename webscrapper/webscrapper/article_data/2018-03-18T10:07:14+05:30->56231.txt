KOTTAYAM:   leaders called on Kerala Congress (M) chairman K M   at his residence in   on Saturday ahead of KC(M)’s steering committee meeting on Sunday. BJP national executive member P K Krishnadas and state spokesperson   were among the leaders who reached Mani’s residence in the morning.

 After the visit, Krishnadas said that they visited Mani to seek the support of the veteran leader in the Chengannur bypoll. BJP is the first political party that has sought the support of the KC (M) for the Chengannur bypoll.
 
 For a while, KC (M) has been on an independent stand, keeping a distance from the LDF and the UDF. The KC (M) steering committee meeting to be held on Sunday here will decide the party’s stand in the bypoll as well as the   elections. According to a senior BJP leader, the visit was based on the directive from the national leadership of the party.
 
 The visit by the BJP leaders assumes significance as the Muslim League is striving to bring back Mani to the UDF camp and the   is trying to guide him to their camp. The steering committee meeting will begin at Hotel Orchid at 2.30pm.
 
 In the Rajya Sabha elections, six MLAs of the party have voting rights. However, their votes are insignificant as the LDF candidate is sure of winning. So a decision whether to desist from voting will be made in the meeting. The decision about the stand to be taken in the Chengannur bypoll is likely to be postponed as the poll date is yet to be declared.
