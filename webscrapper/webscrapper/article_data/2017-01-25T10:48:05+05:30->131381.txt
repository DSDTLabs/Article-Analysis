CHANDIGARH: A quiet but radical shift has taken place in the   (PCA). The old guard which ran   for decades has handed over power to ex-players -surprisingly without any resistance. An interim body has taken over following Supreme Court's order that office-bearers in BCCI and its state associations who don't meet the eligibility criteria set by   shall cease to hold office.

 The interim body includes a fourmember ad-hoc committee with former Punjab Ranji players   and  . The other two members of the committee are   and  . Singla is the convener of the committee. After Supreme Court's order, PCA is the first state association -among all BCCI-affiliated units -that has ex-players taking over the reins.
 
 The Supreme Court's order has totally cleaned up the top brass of PCA, which includes its chairman IS Bindra, president DP Reddy, treasurer Vishwa jeet Khanna, secretary general MP Pandove and secretary GS Walia. Bindra and Pandove were in power for almost four decades.
 
 According to Lodha committee's recommendations, an office-bearer should not be older than 70 years, should not be a government servant or minister, should not hold office in another sports organisation, and should not have held office with a state association for more than nine years.
 
 While Bindra and Pandove are more than 70 years old, Reddy and Khanna are IAS officers and Walia has been in the PCA set-up for more than 16 years. It is learnt that Reddy and Khanna resigned from their posts on Jan 12 and 13.
 
 The vacuum at the top prompted the ex-players to take over PCA administration for an interim.
 
 Ex-secretary of the PCA, GS Walia, confirmed to TOI that all powers now lie with the four-member committee.
 
 “We have no intention of creating any hurdles in the working of Punjab's cricket,“ he added.
