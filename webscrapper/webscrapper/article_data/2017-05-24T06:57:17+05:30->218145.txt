PUNE: The   (PMC) will carry out a technical   of its   processing units in the city to gauge their actual capacity and current status.

 A proposal regarding it was approved at the standing committee meeting on Tuesday. As per PMC officials, the total expense for the plan is Rs 35 lakh and it will have to be completed within three months.
 
 The move comes against the backdrop of questions raised by many political parties and activists over the garbage   set up by the PMC. Also, a comprehensive plan has to be drafted as per the chief minister’s assurance to the agitated residents of Uruli-Phursungi.
 
 The PMC had stopped dumping of waste at the garbage depot in Uruli-Phursungi after a major fire broke out here in April. It had spread over five acres. The civic officials said over 500 truckloads of sand was used to bring the fire under control. Also, recycled water was used to douse the fire. “The fire was controlled after one week of efforts,” they said.
 
 The residents of these villages have not been allowing the dumping of garbage at the depot. They have blamed “the state government and the PMC for not taking steps to deal with the garbage disposal issue”. The locals said , the state and the PMC had promised them to sort out the matter in nine months, but the problem still persists even after two years.
