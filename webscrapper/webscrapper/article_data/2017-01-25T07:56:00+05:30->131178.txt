Bathinda: Bathinda district police have booked Rampura municipal council president Sunil Bitta, who belongs to Shiromani Akali Dal, and three officials of the civic body — executive officer Ramesh Kumar and clerks Dharam Singh and Lachhman Singh — for allegedly committing financial irregularities to influence voters, concealing records and stopping officials from discharging their duty.

 The case was recommended by the Rampura Phul constituency returning officer (RO) on Tuesday afternoon, after an inspection team of the Election Commission found six blank pages of a tender book of the MC with signatures of the officials without the seal, blank cheques that were dated January 3, a day before the model code of conduct for the Punjab elections came into force; and non-maintenance of cash book of the council. Bitta is also accused of having misbehaved with the EC team while it had gone to the MC office to seize records following a complaint of irregularities to influence voters.
 
 The Congress candidate from the constituency, Gurpreet Singh Kangar, had on Monday complained to the RO about the irregularities in the MC, saying that the civic body had initiated development work after the code came into force. He had alleged that the council chief had claimed that the works were started before the poll code came into force.
 
 RO Dhaliwal told TOI that working on the complaint, the EC team was sent to the council office, where officials did not cooperate and told it that the documents were in the possession of the MC president. He said when the MC president reached the office, he misbehaved with the EC team members. “The EC team managed to take the council record in its possession and found grave irregularities, like blank pages in the register and signed blank cheques with old dates. Going by it, I have written to the police to register a criminal case against council president Bitta, EO and two clerks,” Dhaliwal said.
