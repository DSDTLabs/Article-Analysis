BHOPAL The   (CDRF) on Tuesday directed a noted builder and developer of Bhopal to return the entire booking amount given to the company by a woman flat buyer along with an interest of 18 per cent. In her complaint in 2014,   informed the consumer forum that she was duped by the builder, who sold the flat she had booked to someone else. The bench headed by   said that the buyer had paid Rs 5.5 lakh to the builder as booking amount, but the builder did not bother to inform her or send her any notice before selling her already booked flat.

 During the hearing, it came to light that instead of  , the builder chose to ignore her calls and tried to escape with her money. During the hearing, the builder said that since the complainant had not given the final payment, he sold the property to someone else. However, the judge rejected his claims terming it baseless. The forum observed that since the property was sold to a different customer, the builder has to refund the full booking amount along with interest of 18 per cent and an additional Rs 2000 as mitigation charges. “This deceitful attitude of the party reflects its indifference to the complainant's plight which is evident in documents in support of the complaint. Therefore pay a sum of Rs 5.5 lakh with 18 per cent interest for the physical strain and mental agony suffered by the consumer. Also pay a sum of Rs 2000 towards cost of this petition,” the bench stated in its order.
