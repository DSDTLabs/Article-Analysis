AHMEDABAD: Hemal Prajapati, 28, a resident of Marwadi Chawl in   was found dead in his house on Tuesday evening. Police sources said the body was highly decomposed. The hands and legs of the deceased were tied and the body was hidden under a mattress, which points to murder.

 Inspector of Gaekwad Haveli police station, J A Rathwa, said they have registered a case of accidental death and are waiting for the postmortem to lodge a case of murder.
 
 “The deceased was of unsound mind and used to live alone in the house. His father, Chunilal Prajapati, who had a provision store in Jamalpur now lives at   near   lake. Hemal’s brother drives an autorickshaw,” added Rathwa. Police officials said that from the first sight of the body, this appears to be a murder. “His hands and legs were with a a nylon rope. No one can commit suicide after tying up their hands and legs. As the body was highly decomposed we couldn’t see injury marks,” Rathwa added.
 
 According to police sources, Prajapati was of unsound mind and roamed about in the area. “Locals told us Prajapati sometimes got naked in public. To survive, he sometimes worked as a labourer in the vegetable market nearby or begged for money from his relatives,” said a police source.
 
 Police officials said they learned that Prajapati was an alcoholic. “However, he was not a nuisance in the area, nor do we have a criminal record against him. If this is a murder, the perpetrator could be a known person or someone Prajapati had liquor with,” said a police source.
