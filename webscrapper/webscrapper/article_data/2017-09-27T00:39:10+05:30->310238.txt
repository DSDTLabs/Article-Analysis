Do your mornings begin with a steaming cuppa, seated on your favourite chair, with a newspaper and pen in hand, cracking Su-doku numbers? If yes, then this is just the piece of news that you have been waiting for. The Times Su-doku Championship is back again, giving puzzle enthusiasts an opportunity to compete against the best in their city, and prove their mettle and love for numbers. This time around, four lucky winners from across the country will get an opportunity to represent the country at the World  , which will be held in Bengaluru.
 The Times Su-doku Championship aims to find the four best players in the country. Three winners from each city round — Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata — will then battle it out in the national finale, to be held in Mumbai in October, and four will finally make it to the competition in Bengaluru.
  Age is not a restriction, making this the perfect opportunity for Su-doku lovers to use their skills and bring glory to the country.
