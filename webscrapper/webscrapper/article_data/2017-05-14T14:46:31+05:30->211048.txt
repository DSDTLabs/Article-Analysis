NEW DELHI: Sacked Aam Aadmi Party leader   collapsed immediately after a press conference he held to expose "financial irregularities" in the party. Mishra has been on a hunger strike for the past five days.

 Mishra was taken to the RML hospital after he fainted. Sources said his condition is not serious. "He collapsed due to dehydration and low sugar level; he should get better with intravenous (IV) fluids and medicines," sources added.
 
 He is being monitored at the recovery room of the emergency department of the RML hospital, sources added.
 
  
  
 
 He had earlier claimed that the report of his health is "faked" by the doctors, who were directly reporting to health minister Satyendar Jain, even as a team of doctors from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital late on Friday night examined Mishra and said his vitals, including blood pressure and sugar level, were normal.
 
 Alleging that his health reports were faked to prevent another expose, Mishra said in a tweet, "Before tomorrow's expose, they are spreading fake news and trying to divert attention. It is a ploy to end my hunger strike."
 
 The city witnessed a politically charged day as at the start of the media conference, the suspended Delhi minister showed a presentation - without official bank documentation - that he claimed included account information of the party.
 
  Mishra alleged a huge discrepancy in 2013-2014 and 2015-2016 between the amounts AAP has in the bank, what it declared to the EC and what it made public on its website.
 
 Before fainting, the former Delhi minister alleged that the AAP received funds worth crores of rupees from several "shell" companies.
 
 "Sixteen shell companies managed by AAP MLA Shiv Charan Goyal donated to Aam Aadmi Party," he alleged.
