NEW DELHI: In its third year, the   plans to improve learning outcomes at  , education minister   said on Tuesday. The government also wants to create   in each zone from the coming academic year to help mentor students on the basis of their interests.

 Speaking at the Excellence Awards ceremony, Sisodia said that some of these schools would focus on leadership training, some on vocational training and some others on sports. “I want at least one school in each area known for one field of excellence. These schools will create a conducive environment similar to that of private schools.” 
 
 Elaborating on the idea, the adviser to the education minister, Atishi Marlena, said that though the plan was still in the making, the government wanted to introduce it in the coming session. Like Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalayas in Delhi, which help high-scoring students get specialised attention, the schools of excellence will provide specialised mentorship. “These schools will be equipped in terms of infrastructure and staff to mentor students,” she said. 
 
 The government will also introduce a leadership training programme in pilot schools before expanding it to others. “We want our children to inculcate leadership qualities. They should be able to provide leadership to society, the nation,” said Sisodia. 
 
 Claiming that in two years, the government has improved infrastructure by creating 16,000 classrooms, Sisodia said, “This is equivalent to having around 500-600 schools alone.” However, critisising the quality of education, he said students in classes VI and VIII could not read their textbooks. “The government now wants to focus on the ability to read and learn. We have already sent teachers and principals to foreign universities for exposure. This year we want to shift our focus from training to learning,” the minister said.
