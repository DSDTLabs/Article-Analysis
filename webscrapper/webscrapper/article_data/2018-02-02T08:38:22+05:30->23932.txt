SURAT:   arrested a 29-year-old   thrice last year and once even attacked and looted him. 

 The accused Mohammed Shamim Samsu Saiyed, a resident of Gund village in Bharatpur of Rajasthan, targeted the house of Saros Bhacca, who is also an eminent Parsi community member. Saiyed had noticed that Bhacca lived alone in his Shahpore area home when he went there to purchase scrap. He planed the theft early in 2017.
 
 Police are yet to arrest   who was involved in the loot that took place on January 23. The accused had carried out three thefts in 2017 and one loot on January 23 at Bhaccaâ€™s house. Like past thefts, the accused would have escaped after stealing valuables on January 23 but listening to Bhacca voice they went to check on first floor. One of the robbers attacked him with a screw driver and injured him.
 
 Police identified the accused from a motorcycle he used during loot. Bhacca had installed   camera at his home after three thefts that remained undetected. Saiyed was captured leaving the house on the bike. He had burgled valuables over Rs 25 lakh from the residence.
