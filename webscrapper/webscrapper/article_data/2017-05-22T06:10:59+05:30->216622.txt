LUCKNOW: Quoting  ,   Ram Naik on Sunday wrote a letter to assembly Speaker Hridaya Narain Dixit, saying that the election of the   by the outgoing speaker was unconstitutional. 

 Naik said he was confident that the notification by the Speaker of the previous assembly would be reviewed.
 
 In a press release issued on Sunday, Naik said he had sought the opinion of Kashyap on the issue.
 
 The notification for LoP Ram Govind Chaudhary was issued by outgoing Speaker Mata Prasad Pandey after the assembly election results. Naik said Kashyap had opined that the election of the LoP had violated the Constitution and the new Speaker should take note of it.
 
 Naik said the tradition of the outgoing Speaker electing the LoP or leader of the House should be stopped as it violated the spirit of the Constitution. This was the right of the new Speaker, he said.
 
 Naik also challenged the “unconstitutional” election of the LoP in 14 assemblies of the state since 1952. He said the correct process was followed only in 1957, 1985 and 1997. 
 
 Naik had vehemently objected to the election of the Chaudhary as LoP by Mata Prasad Pandey. He had referred the matter to the new Speaker.
 
 On the last day of the assembly on Friday, the issue, as desired by Naik, was read out before the House which referred it to a committee for the final decision. Before that, Naik has brought expert opinion for the committee to refer to.
