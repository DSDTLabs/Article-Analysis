WASHINGTON: A common antimicrobial ingredient  , found in bar soaps and toothpastes, may alter gut   and increase the risk of colon cancer, a study has found. 

 
 The study, published in the journal ‘Science Translational Medicine’, suggests that short-time treatment with low-dose triclosan caused colonic inflammation, and exaggerated disease development of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer in mice.
 
 “These results, for the first time, suggest that triclosan could have adverse effects on gut health,” said   from the  .
 
 Triclosan is among the most widely used antimicrobial ingredients and is found in more than 2,000 consumer products, researchers said. 
 
 Researchers investigated the effects of triclosan on colonic inflammation and colon cancer using several mouse models. In all mouse models tested, the antimicrobial agent promoted colonic inflammation and colon tumorigenesis.
