KOLKATA: The Jadavpur police has claimed that the Golf Gardens minor girl, who was found with bruise marks in an alley on May 4, had actually fallen from a   and the incident was entirely accidental in nature.

 Cops said the 15-year-old girl had received injuries near her eyes and scratch marks on her body due to the fall. She was neither pushed nor assaulted by anyone, which the minor initially claimed.
 
 According to top senior cops, the girl was upset that her grandfather was summoned by her school after she stopped attending it from April. On May 3, she had gone to the flat where her grandmother is employed as a cook and climbed up to the terrace.
 
 In the afternoon, she thought of taking a nap in the terrace of that building. So, she went to the fourth floor and collected a few slippers, which she used as a bed to sleep on. After she woke up in the evening, she thought if went down the stairs the residents might think she was a thief and rebuke her.
 
 “It was finally at 10 am that she decided to come down but found the main door locked from inside. She decided to use the water pipe to climb down but lost her balance. She hit the parapet and fell down where she lay in a semi-conscious state before being recovered the next morning and rushed to the MR Bangur Hospital,” claimed an officer.
 
 The police version of the exact sequence of events stands in sharp contrast to what the girl seemed to have claimed earlier.
