 The arrested individuals have been identified as Ikram (24), Saddam (23), Munfed (20), Alim (20) and Arif (23). They told police that members who crossed the prescribed age were asked to ‘retire’ and form another gang.
 
 “These criminals would often use red beacons on highway to intimidate other travellers and would flee after looting the victims. We had been searching for them ever since they kidnapped one youth and extorted Rs 50 lakh from the family,” Alwar police official said.
 
 The police are currently interrogating the five members to get more details about their involvement in other similar crimes near Alwar, Bhiwadi and Bharatpur.
