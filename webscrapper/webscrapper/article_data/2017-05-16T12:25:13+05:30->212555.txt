RAIPUR: Three persons were charred to death after fire broke out in a factory located in  's   area on Monday. 

 According to police, the factory - MP Paints - was operating illegally. A fire broke out due to some chemical combustion in the unit, with sound of the blast heard by residents of Khamtarai who live near the factory. The blaze claimed lives of three people, including factory owner Krishna Sagar's 76-year-old father and two labourers. Krishna and his wife also sustained 90% burns.
 
 The factory is engaged in manufacturing paints. Inflammable products used to mak paint caught fire around 11.00 am, rapidly spread across the unit and engulfed factory owner's father and two labourers.
 
 After police was informed about the fire, around six water tankers and fire tenders were deployed that brought the blaze under control within one-and-half hours. The rescue team could enter the factory only after a   machine smashed its wall.
 
 Krishna and his wife were rushed and admitted to government-run Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar Hospital but their conditions are reported to be critical. 
 
 As per locals, a fire incident had occurred at the same factory around four years ago after which residents of Dhan Laxmi Nagar felt threatened. Moreover, as the factory is near a school, citizens held a demonstration demanding its closure as they felt it posed a threat to the safety of their children but the local administration turned a deaf ear to their plea.
 
 After Monday's incident, the residents are again scared and in a state of panic after seeing the charred bodies.
