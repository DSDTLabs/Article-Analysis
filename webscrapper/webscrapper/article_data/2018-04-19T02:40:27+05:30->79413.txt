NEW DELHI: A   of robbers that used to shoot at its targets was busted after a chase in   early on Wednesday. The accused, Monu, Abhishek and a juvenile, first shot at a man near   on Tuesday night when he resisted their robbery bid and then drove to   where they fired upon three others. They also opened fire at the police team that intercepted them at a barricade near Lajpat Nagar on Wednesday. 

 Three countrymade pistols, a knife and two stolen motorbikes have been seized. “They were involved in several other cases around Saket and Malviya Nagar,” said Chinmoy Biswal, DCP, southeast. Monu, a resident of Madangir, is a school dropout while Abhishek and the juvenile were his neighbours. 
 
 Monu said they had planned to rob passersby to get money for drugs. On Tuesday night, they first tried to rob Rahul near Chirag Dilli. When he resisted, they shot at him and fled with his belongings. They then targeted three men on a footpath near Nizamuddin. After failing to snatch a phone, they fired indiscriminately and fled. When one of the victims, Rashid, was being taken to hospital, cops got a tip-off that the gang would try its luck at the same spot around 2am and laid a trap. 
 
 Seeing the police barricade, Monu tried to turn the bike back. But a police team already following them chased the accused and they rammed a vehicle. Abhishek then pulled out a pistol and shot at the police vehicle.
