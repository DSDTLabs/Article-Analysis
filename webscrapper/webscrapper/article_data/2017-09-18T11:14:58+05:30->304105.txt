BHUBANESWAR: The strike called by the ruling   (BJD) in Odisha over petrol and diesel prices shattered life across the state on Monday. 

 School children and office-goers bore the brunt as protesters blocked roads and damaged autos and bikes in Bhubaneswar.
 
 BJD workers also burnt tyres at most traffic intersections in the capital bringing road transport to a grinding halt. Some commuters were also manhandled in those areas.
 
 Apprehending trouble, fuel filling stations were shut down till noon in the city.
 
 The BJD has announced to hold a five-hour protest against the rising prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas across the block headquarters and the districts on Monday.
 
 Addressing a news conference on Sunday, BJD   member   and   said the 'Haq Pain Hartal (protest for rights)' from 7am to 12 noon will not affect the emergency services anywhere. Adding that the rising fuel prices have adversely affected the common man, Acharya said the fuel prices in India are among the highest in the south Asian region, despite the neighbouring countries depending on the same sources for crude oil.
 
 "There can be no justification for such high fuel prices since the crude prices globally are on a downward spiral. The Centre is favouring certain private companies by keeping the prices exceptionally high," Acharya said.
 
 The BJP, however, said the BJD is raising the issue of fuel price to divert attention from its own failures. Addressing a news conference, BJP MLA Pradip Purohit said the BJD is desperate to shift the focus from its failures by calling a hartal.
