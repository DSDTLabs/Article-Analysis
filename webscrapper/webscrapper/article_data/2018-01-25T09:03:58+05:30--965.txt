Some of the other words that he used included 'etugadalu' and 'dasha disha' which mean ‘strategic plans’ and the ‘way forward’. "I have a great responsibility. I will not criticise for the sake of indulging in criticism. I will not even react to criticism against me," he said.
 
 Impressing upon the crowd that he has always loved Telangana, he said after the success of a film when he wanted to do something for Nalgonda to tackle fluorosis, he was not allowed by politicians.
