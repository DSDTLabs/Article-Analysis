GREATER NOIDA: In a sudden move, senior Congress leader   on Sunday quit the party and joined the   (BJP) in presence of Keshav Prasad Maurya in Lucknow. This move comes as a jolt to the Congress, and is likely to dent its vote bank and change the political equations, specially in Jewar assembly constituency where Singh has a sound network.

 This reminds of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when congress candidate from Gautam Budh Nagar Ramesh Chand Tomar had fled from the party and joined BJP with just a week before the election. This led to a massive win for the BJP candidate Mahesh Sharma. The  , however, claimed Singh’s exit will have no impact as their voters are loyal to the party.
 
 Singh told TOI that he was dissatisfied with the functioning of Congress Party leaders and hence he put in his papers. Singh, a resident of Rabupura area, had been associated with the Party for 30 years. He came to limelight during the land acquisition of Bhatta Parsaul when he took the Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi from Pari Chowk to the village on his bike, and led a massive protest.
 
 Mahendra Nagar, president Gautam Budh Nagar Congress, said that Singh’s exit will not make any difference. “For the last few months his activities indicated he was going to join the BJP. We are sure that his exit will not divide our vote bank as our voters are loyal,” he said.
 
 The BJP is likely to field him from Jewar assembly constituency in the February 11 polls.
