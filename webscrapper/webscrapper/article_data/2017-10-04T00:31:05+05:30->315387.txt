Coimbatore: Promoters of the City Television Network, a private   television network in the city, staged a protest outside the Coimbatore corporation office on Tuesday after the town planning wing started removing its cables at Gandhi Park and Ram Nagar.

 R Elango, distributor of the company, said, “We set up the company in Coimbatore two months ago and have nearly 8,000 customers. We laid over-head cables to provide cable television at very low rates. We provide 470 channels including pay channels. We had applied for permission to lay the cables On September 1. On October 1, the district administration passed an order to remove the cables,” he said.
 
 Elango said his firm is being ‘purposefully targeted’. “None of the other cable operators in the district have got the necessary approvals. Authorities are purposefully targeting us. The government wants to take over the three crore   connections and is indulging in huge corruption,” he said.
 
 Town planning officer Ravichandran told TOI that he had received an order from the district administration asking him to remove the cables. “As per the government order 51, 2000, for laying cable television cables, the operator should take permission from the local body. They need to deposit an amount and also get a no-objection certificate from the district collector. Since these permissions had not been taken, we removed the cables. So far, we have removed cables on Thadagam Road, R S Puram, A K S Nagar, Ponnaiyarajapuram, Edayar Street, Oppanakara Street and Ram Nagar. Cables at Gandhipuram, Udayampalayam and Papanaickenpalayam will be disconnected on Wednesday,” he said.
