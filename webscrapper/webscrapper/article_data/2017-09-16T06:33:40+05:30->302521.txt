MUMBAI: The ongoing   near   is drawing vast crowds yet is being conducted in a pleasant orderly fashion as compared to previous years. Residents say they are not inconvenienced by roadblocks or traffic diversions.

 One resident Lucy Fernandes said, “Police has given car passes to residents of nearby buildings, but this year they are hardly demanding to see them. I have moved up and down the hill several times since Sunday and I am pleasantly surprised to see the smooth movement of pedestrians and traffic this year.“
 
 People who live in the vicinity seldom visit the fair given the crowds of outsiders.In fact, more outsiders arrive to shop. A vast number of stalls selling wax idols of houses, babies, cradles and body parts are popular as offerings for wishes sought at the basilica. East Indian goodies like kadio bodio and homemade snacks also find favour.
 
 Throngs of worshippers of all faiths have been arriving for mass at the shrine since the day of Our Lady's Feast September 8. Bishop   who is the rector of Mount   said, “We had a series of masses Sunday morning and each was crowded. But that evening fewer people arrived.Over Monday and Tuesday ,a steady stream of devotees has come. We had a special mass for the sick and elderly Monday morning where senior citizens from old age homes and several people from parishes across Mumbai joined.“
 
 The archbishop of Bombay Oswald Cardinal Gracias will officiate at special mass at 11.30am on the closing Sunday of Bandra Fair September 17.
