PATNA: After listening to the   in a   on Wednesday, Patna district magistrate (DM)   urged the officials concerned to sort their problems and make sure that they are provided monthly allowance up to Rs 10,000 by their kids. In case, their children don’t give the amount on time, they will have to give interest later.

 The DM said such matter should be disposed of in a month and in case they are complicated, they should be dealt with in one and a half months at the most. “There is no dearth of money to help senior citizens. Their life and health is our responsibility”, said Agarwal.
 
 He instructed the officials to help them in getting the pension they are entitled to without any delay. “We will have such meetings once in every three months and I also want the SDOs and local police stations to listen to the grievances of elderly citizens on priority basis,” said the DM.
 
 He further urged the society to establish a senior citizens’ club in each locality where old people can have get-togethers. “There are people who have homes, but stay alone. Such people can provide a room in their house where others can come and have discussion. In case, they have difficulty in finding a place, we will provide them a room in the community hall which they can use. We will ensure that medical camps are also organized in such clubs,” said the DM.
 
 SKN Haider, a retired official, who is member of one such club, told how retired people come together and discuss various social issues. They also help needy women and provide them training in sewing.
