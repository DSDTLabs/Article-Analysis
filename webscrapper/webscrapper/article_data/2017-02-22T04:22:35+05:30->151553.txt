VADODARA: The state budget declared on Tuesday offered no surprises for Vadodara. The promises made in the budget have been discussed for quite some time now.

 The budget mentions the flyover from   to the   that is touted to be the longest in the state and one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects that the   (VMC) was eyeing. It had sought grants for the same from the state government.
 
 A mention of the flyover was made in the state budget for the current fiscal year. Recently when deputy chief minister   was in the city, he had even announced that the first instalment of Rs 76 crore would be released by April this year. Patel had said that the flyover will come up at a cost of Rs 350 crore and would be completed in three years. The 3.4km long flyover is expected to begin at Genda Circle and land somewhere near the Manisha Crossroads.
 
 The VMC is still awaiting clarity on whether the flyover will be constructed by the state road and building department or by civic body itself. The VMC had recently sought that the flyover be constructed by the state roads and buildings department. VMC officials had said that this would become clear once the first instalment was released.
 
 The regional science museum is another project that has been in the pipeline since 2015. The VMC had even stated at that stage that the state government had already earmarked funds for the project. Similar museums were to come up at four other places in the state and were modelled on the lines of the Science City in Gandhinagar.
 
 The increase in the number of seats at the medical college has also been in the pipeline and the college is gearing up for the same.
