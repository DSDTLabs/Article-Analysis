BENGALURU: Unperturbed by the potential threat of being faced with massive intellectual bankruptcy, the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (COA) has decided to strike-off names of each and every individual in  's list of committees - a total of 24 of them - and put the ball in the court of those individuals to prove they are eligible under the Lodha Committee reforms to continue.

 On Sunday, the COA issued directions on the   (IPL) 2017 player auctions, categorically stating that in respect of the members of the IPL Governing Council, "only those persons who are not disqualified in terms of the strict understanding interpretation of the disqualifications in terms of the various orders issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court may attend the auctions".
 
 In that context, CK Khanna (President),   (secretary) and Anirudh Chaudhry (treasurer) and any other person who claims to be ex officio member of the IPL GC on account of being an office bearer of the BCCI shall not be entitled to attend the auctions.
 
 The five members of the Governing Council -   (Chairman), Jyotiraditya Scindia, MP Pandove,   and PV Shetty -have all been left ineligible under the   reforms and therefore, technically , the Council ceases to exist in its present form.
 
 Ganguly, for instance, also heads the BCCI's technical committee. If the former India captain needs to continue in this position, he has to prove to the COA that he is eligible for the same under the Lodha reforms.
 
 The COA, however, has not asked these individuals to stay away. Instead, the administrators said they "do not have complete data to determine whether the members of the GC other than the ex officio members are disqualified or not.
