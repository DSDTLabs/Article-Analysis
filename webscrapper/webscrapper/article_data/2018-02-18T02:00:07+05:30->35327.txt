MUMBAI: Two ticket checkers (TC) of Western Railway (WR) were suspended for allegedly allowing six railway employees to travel without tickets in an   train on Friday. 

 Commuters had a heated argument with the duo after they found out that they were allowing six persons to travel in the train. The rule book states that even railway employees are not allowed to travel in AC trains without tickets. 
 
 A WR spokesperson said, "Ticket checking staff   and   were suspended and an inquiry has been ordered." 
 
 The incident was posted on social media. Commuters said that unauthorised travellers were railway employees. The incident prompted a commuter to pull the chain because of which the train was halted for a few minutes at Andheri. Railways have deputed TCs in AC trains to prevent unauthorised travel.
