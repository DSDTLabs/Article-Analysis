KOLKATA: Filmmaker   has decided to upload ‘Firebird’, his uncensored documentary on Maoism, on a video-sharing site as a mark of protest against the Central Board of Film Certification’s (CBFC) “arbitrary method of functioning that is gagging voices”.

 Dastidar, who has been filming the Maoist movement for 17 years, will upload the movie in parts starting Wednesday. “I have had quite a few run-ins with CBFC, but things are going overboard now. I was appalled to see the way CBFC decided to mute the word ‘Radha’ from a song. At this rate, we will soon be asked to ration our speech. If words like ‘Radha’ are censored, it’s death for dialogue-writers. They are being held at ransom,” said Dastidar, adding he was “disgusted” by the “Fascist” move. 
 
 Dastidar — who has shot his movie in Bastar, Palamou and border areas of Odisa — said he was sure his movie would never get a certification, the way CBFC members are interpreting guidelines. “If they are reacting to the word ‘Radha’ this way, there is no way they’ll clear my content. That’s why I have decided to release it online. It is my way of telling the board that there is no point curbing an artist’s freedom of expression,” he said.
 
  
  
 
 
 Linguist Pabitra Sarkar felt this was a very valid way of protest. “I have read about how the word ‘Radha’ was snipped from this film. Have they forgotten the song ‘Bol   sangam hoga ki nahi?’ CBFC’s decision is a result of sheer stupidity. They are only trying to gag opinion,” Sarkar said. Director  , who had produced ‘Amu’ in 2005 that had faced the CBFC’s axe, is also happy with Dastidar’s method of protest.
 
  
  
 
 
 “That a government board, standing above citizens, should decide permissibility of artistic content is distasteful, anachronistic and in direct violation of the right to conscience, and has no place in modern democratic polity,” he said.
 
 Director   said such casualties will happen if a cinema-literate person doesn’t helm CBFC.
