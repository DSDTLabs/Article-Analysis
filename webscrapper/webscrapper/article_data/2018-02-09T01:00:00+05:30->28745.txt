Trichy: A trivial dispute between a man and his wife ended in the death of the couple in the late hours of Wednesday. While the wife set herself ablaze, the husband who attempted to save her succumbed to injuries along with his wife. The victims were identified as Suresh, 40, and his wife Sathya, 35, residents of Usman Ali Nagar in KK Nagar. It all began when an argument broke out between the two on Wednesday afternoon over the delay in cooking lunch.  Suresh, who was running a parcel service bought fish in the morning and had asked his wife to cook it for lunch. As the lunch was not ready when he came back home, he asked her about it. This resulted in a verbal duel which prolonged for more than an hour. Sathya who threatened to commit suicide suddenly locked herself up inside a room and set herself ablaze with kerosene. Shocked by the extreme step, Suresh went to her rescue and embraced her in an attempt to douse the fire. Unfortunately, he too caught fire and both of them were burnt in the flames. Unable to bear the pain, the couple screamed for help. Sureshâ€™s mother Gayathri, 67 who was also at home sought help from the neighbours and rushed the couple to the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH). Since the burns were severe, they did not respond to treatment and they succumbed to injuries on Wednesday midnight.  The couple is survived by a 17-year-old son and a 15-year-old daughter. The KK Nagar police are investigating.
