In wake of the violent incident on the Jaipur sets of  's 'Padmavati', Indian film fraternity has been voicing their opinion and supporting the veteran   on social media and other platforms.

  
  
 Anurag Kashyap, who is known for speaking his mind sans filters on Twitter, went ahead to make a comment on the recent state of affairs. "Hindu extremists have stepped out of   into the real world now.. and Hindu terrorism is not a myth anymore," he posted. To which an online troll retorted, "@anuragkashyap72 hey buddy let me give u free advice "stop sleeping with @karanjohar."
 
  
  This did not go down well with the 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' director, who took to Twitter within a minute to shut down the troll saying, "Let me give you some better advice!! Start sleeping with someone!!! You frustrated Fuck!!!!"
 
  
  
  Anurag and Karan share a great camaraderie. They co-directed 'Bombay Talkies' and Anurag gave Karan his first break as an actor, in his film 'Bombay Velvet'. However, this will be the first time when one is seen vocally supporting the other on social media.
 
  
 Sanjay Leela Bhansali was attacked by a fringe group,  , while he was shooting 'Padmavati' in Jaipur. The director, who has vowed not to shoot any film of his in the Pink city, has flown back to Mumbai.
