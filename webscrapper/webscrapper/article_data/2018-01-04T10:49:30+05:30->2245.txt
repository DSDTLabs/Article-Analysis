 Medical experts told TOI that a patient is not allowed to eat or drink before administering general anaesthesia. “This is because when a patient is anaesthetised, his/her body's reflexes are temporarily stopped. If a patient’s stomach has food and fluid in it, there's a risk of vomiting, or regurgitation (bringing up food into throat),” they said.
 
 “If this happens, the regurgitated food could spill into lungs and affect breathing, as well as cause damage to lungs,” the experts said.
 
 The amount of time that a patient needs to fast for (go without food or drink) before operation depends on the procedure. “However, it is usually six to eight hours for food, and two hours for fluids,” the experts added.
