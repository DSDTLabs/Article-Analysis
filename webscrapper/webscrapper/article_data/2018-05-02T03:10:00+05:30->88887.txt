Panaji: Goencho Avaaz, an umbrella organization of activists and social organisations, has said that the announcement by town and country planning (TCP) minister Vijai Sardesai of appointing a committee to check illegalities of RP 2021, is just “a diversionary tactic”.

 Co-conveners of Goencho Avaaz, Viriato Fernandes and Swapnesh Sherlekar, reiterated their warning that any permission given against the interests of Goa and Goans “will be severely punished by the people”. “We will pursue all forms of criminal and other actions against the persons concerned,” Goencho Avaaz said.
 
 “How can the TCP minister, who is himself a beneficiary of RP 2021, appoint a committee to investigate his own land deals?” said Goencho Avaaz, demanding that the minister should first resign and then offer himself for probe.
 
 The committee comprises member of Institute of Town Planners, India, and head of department, architectural engineering, Government Polytechnic College, Venancio Fernandes; members of Institution of Engineers-India, Ernesto Moniz and Paresh Gaitonde; member of Indian Institute of Architects, Goa chapter, Manguesh Prabhugaonkar and chief town planner Rajesh Naik. The committee has been asked to submit its report by June 1. 
 
 “We fear that Sardesai is buying time to give permissions for projects that are against the interests of Goa and Goans,” said Goencho Avaaz.
