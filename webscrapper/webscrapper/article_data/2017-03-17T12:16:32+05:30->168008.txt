JAIPUR: Rajasthan has managed to identify just 15   properties in the state despite huge migration from the desert state to Pakistan. With Lok Sabha passing the   (Amendment and Validation) Bill, 2016, collectors have now been asked to study the Act and dig out more such properties, if exists, from their districts. 

 The Act denies inheritance rights to heirs of individuals who left the country for Pakistan and China. As per official figures of Union ministry of home affairs there are 15 properties in Rajasthan that belong to Pakistani nationals. There are no properties left by those migrated to China. 
 
 Documents reveal that Tonk has four, Jodhpur three, Sikar two while Ajmer, Barmer, Jaipur, Bikaner, Jaisalmer and Bhilwara have one each enemy property. However, sources claim that actual number of enemy properties would be in thousands. 
 
 “Collectors have to identify the properties that come under enemy property Act and send it directly to the home ministry. Actual properties would be in thousands but for that diligent exercise will have to be carried out at the district level” said the government official. “Keeping view of the recent act passed in the parliament, collectors have been asked to take necessary action” added the official. 
 
 After the India Pakistan war of 1965, the 'Enemy Property Act' was enacted in 1968 in order to regulate these properties and keep a tab on the powers custodians have. In 2016, the bill was amended and passed by the Lok Sabha but the Rajya Sabha passed the act on only on March 14. 
 
 With the act in place no properties will not be transferred to legal heirs of migrants post 2016. In Rajasthan, major impact would be on people living Ajmer, Tonk, Jaisalmer and Barmer. 
 
 “Lakhs of people moved from Ajmer and border areas in 1947 and then in 1965. There are several cases where their successors are in process of claiming the properties. Same scenario would be in Jaisalmer and Barmer” said  , social activist.
