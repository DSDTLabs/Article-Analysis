CHENNAI: Police on Wednesday nipped in the bud an attempt by a group of youngsters to launch a   at the   on the lines of the pro-jallikattu protests. The youth assembled at the Marina and raised slogans in support of farmers and against the implementation of the hydrocarbon project in   for about 10 minutes before they were rounded up by cops. Police arrested 11 protesters and slapped a case against them under IPC Section 151 (unlawful assembly) before they were released on bail on Wednesday evening.

 Police said the the group gathered near the   on Marina Beach at around 2pm. They were led by a former   student Mani alias Manikadan. The agitators pulled out placards and banners and raised slogans before police personnel arrived at the spot and took them to the Marina police station. 
 
 Nine of the agitators, however, slipped away from the clutches of police personnel. The Marina police arrested the remaining 11 and detained them in a community hall near Nageswara Rao Park in Mylapore until they were released later in the day.
 
 In yet another breach of security at the Marina, at least six agitators gathered on the service road along the beach and protested. Police personnel nabbed the youth and took them to a separate marriage hall in Mylapore, where they were let off in the evening.
 
 People deserted Marina Beach on Tuesday evening after a tweet with the hashtag “#Marina2.0“ -in apparent reference to a proposed second major stir at the hotspot of the January pro-jallikattu protests, this time in solidarity with the state's farmers and against the   hydrocarbon project -gained social media traction.
 
 Mylapore deputy commissioner of police V Balakrishnan told TOI, “Police personnel will take serious action against those spreading rumours about protests in Marina Beach to start Marina2.0. Police are guarding the beach to prevent protesters from gathering there.”
