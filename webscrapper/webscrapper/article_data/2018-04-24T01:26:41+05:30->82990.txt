GURUGRAM: The health department has asked the private   resisting the   (Measles-Rubella)   drive to comply, saying that the target is to immunise all children between ages of 9 months and 15 years. 

 On Monday, civil surgeon B S Rajora said his team would conduct meets in schools to convince parents about the benefits of the vaccine. A number of promotional events, including a rally on Tuesday, are also on the cards.
 
 Rajora, who is planning the drive with a team of doctors, WHO and UNICEF, assured that there would be a monitoring mechanism to ensure safety of students.   and   workers and staff nurses would administer the vaccine to students under the supervision of a medical officer or a doctor. Supervisory teams for designated areas will carry out inspections. 
 
 A total of 6,37,284 children from 1,887 schools, both government and private, will be covered in 4,046 vaccination sessions. “The campaign will start from April 25 and continue for two weeks,” said Rajora.
 
 According to heath officials, the MR vaccine is available only with the government. Allaying fears, they said, “Auto disposable syringes will be used. The staff has been trained and the cold chain system, where the vaccine is maintained between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius, is the best.”
