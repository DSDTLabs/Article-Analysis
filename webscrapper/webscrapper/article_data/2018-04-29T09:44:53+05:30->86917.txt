 ( ): Gujarat MLA and Dalit leader   on Saturday urged people to be united to keep   out of office.

 
 “Your voting pattern should be such that the votes are not split between parties that are against BJP. You have just about two weeks to tell candidates and their parties that you will vote for them if only they do not have a nexus with BJP for power,” Mevani told the audience at ‘Swabhimani Samavesha’ organised by Samvidhana Ulivigagi Karnataka.
 
 Mevani said a JD(S) leader had said in   that it would not hesitate to enter into a coalition with BJP to destroy  . “We will not pardon JD(S) if it sells the votes of the common people to fringe elements for power. We demand JD(S) clarifies its stand before the elections failing which no politically educated person should vote for it,” he said.
