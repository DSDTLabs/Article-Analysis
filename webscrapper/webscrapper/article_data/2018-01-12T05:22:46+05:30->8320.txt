American model   is set to develop her own collection of apparel and accessories -- marking her maiden venture into design.

 The line -- to be called   -- will be created in partnership with shopping channel  , reports hollywoodreporter.com.
 
 "After years of being dressed by professionals, I walked into my closet one day and realized I had lost sight of my own personal style. I am incredibly passionate about this collection because I have created pieces that are not only chic, but that take the guesswork out of getting ready each morning," Brooke said.
 
 The collection will consist of contemporary basics like flowy blouses and tailored button-downs, as well as skirts, scarves, structured bottoms and contemporary jewellery. It will be unveiled on February 15, with prices ranging from $29-$109.
