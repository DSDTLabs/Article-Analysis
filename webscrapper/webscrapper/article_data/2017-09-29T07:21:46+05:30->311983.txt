BENGALURU: Flooding caused by incessant rain has forced nearly 430  , a   near Whitefield, to vacate their houses.

 Residents say water level rose to four feet, inundating the 14.5-acre compound on Wednesday. Though the level receded on Thursday, the situation remained far from normal. “We are living in fear. Most residents are putting up in nearby accommodations,“ said  , president, Sai Gardens  .
 
 “We don't have electricity or water. Rainwater has polluted our drinking water sources. We are also worried about possible disease outbreaks so only a handful of families have returned to their houses so far,“ he added.
 
 “Senior citizens and children had a tough time shifting to safer areas. Water from Central Integrated Pest Management Centre also entered our low-lying premises after their compound wall collapsed,“ said Sampath Ramanujam.
 
 Many residents had bought houses in the community for nearly Rs 30 lakh around 10 years ago. Though the area comes under Seegehalli gram panchayat, residents blame BBMP and BWSSB for the flooding. “BWSSB's contractors have dumped pipes in the storm water drains connecting Yele Mallappa Shetty Lake and Kadugodi. BBMP has failed to remove encroachments from drains,“ said Mahasua. Residents want BBMP to compensate them for their loss.
 
 Suresh Babu, chairman of Seegehalli gram panchayat, said: “It's a lowlying area, so it's prone to flooding. We have deployed workers to drain out water and also intensified anti-mosquito fogging operations.“
 
 BBMP officials said they will clear encroachments. On Wednesday, nearly 300 residents were rescued in four boats. Organizations including Communities and Establishments of Greater Whitefield (FORCE-GW) have provided food and accommodation to the stranded.
