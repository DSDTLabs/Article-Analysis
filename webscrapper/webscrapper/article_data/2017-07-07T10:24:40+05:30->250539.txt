AGARTALA: Union minister of state for human resource development (HRD) MN Pande, who arrived in the state on Wednesday for a two-day visit, spoke to media on Thursday regarding the conduct of West Bengal chief minister  . Saying she flouted official norms of secrecy in how she dealt with governor KN Tripathi, Pande said the situation in West Bengal demands strong action. 

 "The law and order situation is going out of control, because of which the governor spoke to her over telephone. But she made it public using derogatory words against the governor. She not only violated the constitution, but also flouted the oath of secrecy," he charged.
 
 Pande visited several educational institutions and also attended some BJP political programmes. Speaking on allegations of corruption in Tripura University. he said, "I had to cancel a visit to   today because of massive administrative, financial and academic corruption against incumbent vice-chancellor Prof AK Ghosh and a few others. The matter was informed to HRD Ministry before but after coming here I am surprised to know the volume and level of corruption meted out by the university in past few years."
 
 He said MHRD has already ordered an audit in Tripura University and that this would not be the end of the investigation. The ministry is considering employing reputed investigating agencies to investigate the VC and his team.
 
 Pande also said the ministry has been scrutinizing allegations of corruption in   (NIT), Agartala. Charges against the previous director of NIT, Prof PK Bose, will also be looked into, he said.
