AHMEDABAD:   (GTU) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), with Redberri Earth Foundation, USA, last week, to launch MK Gandhi and Martin Luther King Leadership Programme. Dr Deepak Kant Vyas, chairman and CEO, Redberri Global Corporation, St Louis, USA, was present at the varsity for the occasion. He gave a public lecture on ‘Similarity and diversity between M K Gandhi and Martin Luther King’. The lecture was organised by Post Graduate Centre for Business Ethics and   (GTU).

 Vyas has also offered Dr Navin Sheth, vice chancellor, GTU, to set up an overseas centre in Chicago after launching the research programme at the varsity. 
 
 “Martin Luther King Jr took great inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi in pushing forward his civil rights movement; even though they never met personally. That’s why we planned to launch the research programme at GTU,” said Vyas.
 
 GTU has already initiated an innovative course on Asian business and Gandhian philosophy, at its postgraduate centre for management. “We plan to start a lecture series on Gandhiji and Martin Luther King at this centre. Such centres will facilitate faculty and student exchange leadership research programme,” said Dr Sheth.
