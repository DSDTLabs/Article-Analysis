HYDERABAD: Finding substance in grievances aired by aspirants, the   (APAT) on Tuesday stayed the interview by the   ( ) for 172 Group-I posts. The interviews were to start from April 18 and end on May 10. 

 Tribunal's judicial member N Janakirama Rao gave the interim order after a petition by S Mukunda Rao from   and two others challenging the process. 
 
 Petitioners' counsel Jonnalagadda Sudheer said that the APPSC had not learnt any lesson despite the   finding fault with it for framing faulty questions in the preliminary examination. The commission had to repeat the whole exercise after removing the faulty questions and subsequently a list of candidates eligible to take the main exam was prepared. Again there were lapses, Sudheer said. After fresh protests, the APPSC introduced a 'scaling method' for filtering people, he said. 
 
 "There was no prior info about this in the notification and as it is used sparingly in cases where candidates are given option of choosing subjects, its application to the current context was absurd because here candidates were tested in five subjects and there were no options for them to choose or drop any of subject," Sudheer explained. While APPSC claimed that the scaling method was adopted after talking to experts, it never revealed who those experts were, he said.
 
 The petitioners' counsel expressed apprehensions whether this was brought in for those who could not make it to the interview list. The judge sought a counter from the APPSC.
