BHOPAL: Around 100 e-rickshaws would be introduced to improve connectivity to BRTS bus stands. The battery-operated vehicles would be rolled out in March along with smaller midi-buses, according to   officials.

 “There has been a long-standing demand for improving connectivity to BRTS corridor from nearby colonies. Battery operated rickshaws would operate with 5 to 8 km radius in select areas,” said   (BMC) corporator and BCLL director, Keval Mishra.
 
 In the first phase, BCLL would introduce 100 battery operated rickshaws. It would cater to colonies along Hoshangabad and Kolar area. There are around 22 bus stops and a population of around 5 lakh is expected to benefit from the move. A passenger can take an e-rickshaw to connect to the BRTS corridor. The rickshaw would be a pick and drop service for commuters. BCLL project to introduce e-rickshaw would also be linked to their smart card payment network.
 
 Beginning in March, a nominal fee would be charged from passengers by e-rickshaw that would be permitted to operate only in given periphery. BCLL has outsourced the service to a private company. BCLL would receive a royalty in return. A single rickshaw costs about Rs 1.30 lakh. Sources said that rates would range around Rs 10 per ride on sharing basis. Four people can be seated in the eco-friendly rickshaw.
 
 Around 210 larger BRTS buses are being run by BCLL in the state capital. Most of these buses are on the BRTS network stretching some 26 km. BCLL would also introduce 102 new 35-seat midi-buses, of which 80 buses would be rolled out on 10 routes at the inception.
 
 Passengers commuting between Sanskar Upvan (Kolar Road) will get a direct connectivity to Nadra, near the Bhopal railway station. Other routes will connect Bhauri to Halalpur, Halalpur to AIIMS Bhopal, Islamnagar to railway station and far-flung Barrai to railway station, among others.
