GK Jayaram’s play, 
 , intends to provoke thoughts before provoking actions. Humans hurt when they cannot talk and when they do not listen. The play dreams of an empathetic world, where dialogue is the only platform where differences are discussed. In the vast grey area between right and wrong, it’s a conversation that will clear things up.

  The plot revolves around two immigrant families in New York, who gather on election eve 2016 to celebrate a birthday, an engagement and a confidently and ecstatically anticipated first-woman presidency. 
 
  The birthday gift is an honest discussion on these questions – where is home? who belongs to a country? who has the right to decide who belongs? The evening culminates on the street with official and vigilante forces delivering a shorthand response, a summary justice, to the question. The questions remain stubbornly unanswered and the loved ones bear witness to the senseless consequences.
 
  
 is set to be staged at   on April 18 and 19.
