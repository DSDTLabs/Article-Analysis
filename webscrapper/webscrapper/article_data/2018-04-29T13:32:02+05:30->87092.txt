Rapper-singer   has revealed he wants use a photograph of his mother  's plastic surgeon   as his album artwork. 

  
  
 
  The 40-year-old   shared the details about the cover art of his forthcoming album on Twitter by posting a text conversation with one of his friends. 
 
  "This is my album cover. This is plastic surgeon Jan Adams. The person who performed my moms final surgery. Do you have any title ideas?" West wrote along with a photo of the California doctor who operated on Donda before her sudden November 2007 death. 
 
 "I want to forgive and stop hating. LOVE EVERYONE," he texted to his friend named Wes. 
 
  In January 2008, the Los Angeles coroner determined that Donda died of heart disease while suffering from "multiple post-operative factors" after plastic surgery. However, the autopsy failed to determine the exact role the post-op factors played in her death following liposuction and breast-reduction surgery.
