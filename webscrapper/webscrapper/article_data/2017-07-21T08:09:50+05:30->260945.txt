PUNE: Unidentified miscreants stole cash and ornaments worth Rs 6.8 lakh from the bungalow of a prominent businessman in Sahakarnagar on Wednesday.

 Vilas Pandurang Panse (65), owner of Durvankur bungalow, runs a tours and travel agency on  .
 
 According to the police, Panse, his wife, two sons and their wives left for work around 10am, when the miscreants broke into the bungalow from the rear side and cut the window grilles with a sharp weapon and pushed opened the window.
 
 Police said the miscreants first secured the main door with a chain to prevent the family members from entering.
 
 They rushed to the bedrooms and found two cupboards that were not locked. They picked up a bunch of keys and within minutes opened the drawers and stole gold ornaments and some cash and decamped with the booty from the window, the police said.
 
 The burglary came to light after Panse and his family members reached home around 6pm and found that the main door was locked from the inside. They managed to push open the door and discovered the window grilles were cut and their valuables stolen from the cupboards.
 
 The Dattawadi police arrived at the spot after Panse called them.
 
 Investigations revealed that the bungalow facing the main road is located in a crowded place. The miscreants used the rear portion because a CCTV was installed in the front portion of the bungalow, the police added.
 
 Senior inspector Anil Patil on Thursday said,"The Panses had recently completed renovating the bungalow. We will screen the labourers who had been working there and the criminals involved in burglary cases. We are working on clues and hope to solve the burglary soon."
 
 Panse, whose cellphone was switched off, was not available for comment.
