AHMEDABAD: It was his tendency to steal, reluctance to continue work and frequent squabbles with his employer Malti Parekh, 75, that drove Bansi Meena (Kalasva), 19, a native of   of Rajasthan, to   on January 30.

 After a complaint for murder was registered on February 2, a police team arrested Meena from his native place in Rajasthan at 9pm the same day.
 
  Malti Parekh, a resident of Kalash Avenue in  , was found dead by her relatives and neighbours at 8.30pm on February 1. The discovery was made after her son and daughter could not reach her for two consecutive days. Meena, who was hired to take care of all domestic chores, was also unreachable. Her son Himanshu Parekh had registered a complaint for murder against Meena.
 
 R V Desai, inspector of Navrangpura police station, said that after the complaint, they had checked the CCTV footage of the apartments and had found Meena hurriedly leaving the premises at 4pm on January 30. 
 
 “We had also recorded statements of the regular visitors. A woman, working as masseur for the deceased, had told us that the victim and Meena were arguing over food when she was there the same day. The deceased was lying on bed when she was attacked with the pressure cooker lid and was bludgeoned to death,” he said.
 
 Desai added that Meena was getting Rs6,000 for his work. He had earlier tried to steal Rs15,000 from Malti’s purse but was caught. “He wanted to leave but the employers were not ready to let him go. He was apparently threatened that if he tried to leave, he would not get the salary, his first at the household. He then decided to assault her,” he said.
 
 After the murder, Meena went to a salon to get his hair cut. He passed the time till night and then boarded a bus to his native. His brother, working in the city, did not know about the incident when police went knocking on his workplace in Naranpura. Meena was asleep when police team reached his house along with his brother and caught him.
