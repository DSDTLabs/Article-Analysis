PUNE: From inviting   to a luncheon to sitting with   chairperson   for a meeting, PMPML chairman and managing director Tukaram Mundhe seems to have softened his stand a bit.

 This has surprised many as the officer and representatives of both civic bodies refused to see eye to eye until recently. “The shift in the stance of both the sides was necessary to strengthen the city’s bus service,” a source privy to the development told TOI.
 
 Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation chairperson Savale, who had described Mundhe as “anti-constitutional” last week, on Thursday said Mundhe invited her for tea.
 
 “The mayor was also present and we had a discussion for around four-five hours. He listened to all our concerns and pledged bus services in the PCMC areas. a survey of routes and share details with us. The PMPML is set to buy 80 small buses,” she said.
 
 He also agreed to plying of all-women buses in PCMC. The meeting was good and we will release Rs. 5.45 crore, which was on hold till now, to the PMPML. Let bygones be bygones, Savale told TOI. 
 
 Sources close to Tilak also confirmed that the Pune mayor and the PMPML chief have vouched to work in close coordination.
 
 “ Tilak and Mundhe had a long discussion and reached a consensus — to improve the PMPML’s functioning. We don’t think there is need to involve the chief minister,” a corporator said requesting anonymity.
 
 “That Mundhe invited Tilak and Savale to his office is a positive sign. He must have realized that keeping hard feelings with politicians will not help and the situation on ground will not improve. The recent flash-strike by a section of bus operators was an example. No one is doubting Mundhe’s intention. But then if he has to work without a hassle, he had little choice but to soften his stand,” said Sanjay Shitole, a member of the PMP Pravasi Manch.
