A day after taking flak for failing to control violent mobs during Wednesday's bandh, the Mumbai police have finally started to crack down on the rioters. 

 Law-enforcement officials on Thursday initiated the process to book organisers of the Dalit agitation, including leaders, for criminal conspiracy under IPC Section 120B. This section was earlier used to book those who instigated the August 11, 2012, rioting at Azad Maidan. 
 
 "We will be able to ascertain whether or not there was a conspiracy behind fomenting violence," said a police officer. 
 
 Wednesday's protesters will also be charged for damaging public property, assault and attempt to murder. 
 
 "We are still in the process of identifying and compiling the reports from across the city to know the exact damages. Bandh organizers will be made to pay for the damage," said a police officer. Officials will peruse   footage to identify people who damaged public property.
 
 Twenty-five offences have been registered and 37 people have been arrested by the police. Action was also taken against protesters on the railways. Thirty-three cases were registered on Central Railway. Of these, 18 cases were recorded by the   (RPF) under the Indian Railway Act for trespass and obstructing running of a train. Fifteen cases were registered by the GRP under the Indian Penal Code. On   (WR), 22 cases were registered. Of these, 13 were recorded by the   for obstructing train operations and the rest by the GRP. "We will try to be identify miscreants on the basis of CCTV footage from stations," said inspector general AK Singh, RPF (Western Railway). "There was joint deployment of police, GRP and RPF on the suburban and Main line on Wednesday. Preventive arrests were done by the GRP with assistance of RPF,"   added.
