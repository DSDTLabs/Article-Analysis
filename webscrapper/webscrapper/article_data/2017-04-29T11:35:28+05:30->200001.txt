MUMBAI:   failed to lift the spirit of jewellery traders.   in   wore a look of dismay owing to meagre footfalls although retail enclaves like Bandra, Andheri, Malad, Kandivli, Borivli and Mulund reported a fair amount of business. 

 Zaveri Bazar traders said sales fell by 25-30% as compared to the 2016 marriage season. However, Mukesh Mehta of the India   Jewellers Association said, "That would not be the complete picture as most of the business has shifted from Zaveri Bazar. Retailers citywide are reporting a 25-30% increase." Akshay Tritiya 2016 had been a non-starter owing to the closure over excise duty.
 
  In Zaveri Bazar, Madhubhai Shah of Hema Gold said, "It does not seem as if today is Akshay Tritiya. Such is the cash crisis that people who would spend Rs 30,000 are now spending Rs 3,000. These days most people buy gold when they get money in their hands. The niceties of auspicious days are fast fading." Mumbai's oldest jeweller Narrondas Manordass, which sees long lines for gold and silver coins, reported a "marked decrease" in sales. 
 
  "Buyers are holding on to money. Currency is not circulating. Sales are not satisfactory," said a spokesman at Dwarkadas Jewellers. Rupesh Gandhi of Chandiwala Jewellers said, "Sales have dropped by 25-30%. But we were prepared for this. One can only be disappointed if one has high expectations." Pravin Jain of Kundan Jewellers, Goregaon (W), said, "Customers do not have money for luxury. They are weighed down by necessary purchases. Business has dropped by 30%." 
 
 The scene was slightly better in Andheri, Bandra, Malad, Borivli and Mulund. "1gm and 4gm coins are being bought as shagun," said Ramesh Bagecha of Madhuvan. Chandrakant Agre of   said his stock sold more briskly than it had at Gudi Padwa. 
 
 A fair number of weddings took place on Friday. Arya Samaj Mandir in CP Tank solemnised four marriages, said Pt Dharampal Shastriji.
