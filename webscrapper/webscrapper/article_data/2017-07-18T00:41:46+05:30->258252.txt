MUMBAI: Stinking and   on   suburban stations may soon become a thing of the past. 

 As part of the   on Central Railway and Western Railway,  , a non-profit corporation, has hired   that specializes in providing low-cost toilet solutions to renovate 20 blocks on CR. Two such spruced-up toilet blocks were recently made operational on   and   stations. “We are spending over Rs 2 crore for the Nitayam Toilet Project as there were complaints of unusable toilets at many stations,” said Vinod Jain of Rotary International 3141. Rotary will also initiate a similar project on WR.
 
 Sahej Mantri of Agasti said, “At Dadar, the renovated toilet block is on platform 4 (Parel-end) and at Vikhroli, it is on platform 2 (Thane-end).” The paint and flooring have anti-fungal, anti-bacterial properties making them ideal for public toilets. Mantri said, “The flooring was repaired and levelled with polyurethane concrete making it easier to clean them. It will last for 15-20 years as it is an industrial flooring.” The renovation work also included installing exhaust fans for proper ventilation and grilles on the windows. The blocks have been coated with an epoxy-based grey paint with a streak of purple to coordinate with the look of suburban trains. The plumbing has also undergone an overhaul with bigger pipes and new electrical wiring. —Manthan K Mehta
