Working full-time comes with its own share of stress. I’m really fortunate to have an understanding family. That said, I try to intersperse intense work days with long weekends with the family. I like to think I plan well and I don’t procrastinate. I always like being in action mode which helps me become efficient. It’s not about  , it’s about making time!
 
 
 
 I eat right and try to train at least thrice a week. This helps me at work too – wake up, work out, look hot, work!
 
 
 
 Spending quality time with my daughter and husband helps me relax and recharge myself. I’m very positive in my outlook. I believe that there are no mistakes, only lessons in life. This helps me stay happy.
 
 
 
 Both, actually. I take risks but manage them well because I’m meticulous. 
 
 
 Long motorcycle rides help me relax. 
 
 
 I celebrate my success and learn from my setbacks. I believe if you haven’t failed, you haven’t aimed high enough. Both success and failure play an important role in making me a better person.
 
 
 
 In any crisis, identifying the problem is getting the job half done. I believe in the MS Dhoni school of thought – stay calm, stress creates only harm.
