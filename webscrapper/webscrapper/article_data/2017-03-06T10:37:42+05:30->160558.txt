VARANASI: Prime Minister  's sign-off rally in   on Monday, the last day of campaigning in the final phase, speaks aloud about the strategic importance of the constituency for BJP-Apna Dal alliance. This was the seat in Modi's parliamentary constituency which proved a big blot on BJP's landslide win in 2014, when alliance candidate   lost in bypoll held four months after Lok Sabha elections. 

 Two and half years on, much water has flown in the Ganga.   is now a divided house -- Krishna and her daughter Anupriya have parted ways and latter is a Union minister, leading the break-away faction called Apna Dal (Sonelal).
 
  Krishna, on the other hand, is now a rival.
