NEW DELHI: The Centre has introduced a penalty clause where medical students will be fined for blocking a post-graduate (PG) seat and not joining after the second round of counselling. This will be applicable to PG seats under both government colleges and deemed universities, officials said. "Last year, 1,400 PG seats remained vacant as students blocked seats and later opted out. This is unacceptable for there is a dearth of PG seats in the country and creating every additional seat costs a lot of money," an official said. 

 He said according to amendments made to the Post-Graduate Medical Education Regulations, 2000, of the  , all students appearing for counselling will have to submit a registration fee of Rs 25,000 for PG seats in government colleges and Rs 2 lakh for seats in deemed universities. Those belonging to reserved categories will have to pay half the amount.
 
 "If someone opts out in the first round of counselling after being offered a seat, the registration money will be returned. But if he opts out in the second round after accepting a seat, the registration money shall be forfeited," the official said. There are around 38,000 post-graduate seats in medical colleges across the country.
