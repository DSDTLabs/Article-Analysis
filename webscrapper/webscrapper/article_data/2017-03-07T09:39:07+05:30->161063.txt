RAJKOT: The   ( ) has written to the Union finance minister Arun Jaitley demanding scraping of charges levied by some public and private sector banks for cash transactions at branches.

 “Recently, some private and public banks have announced charges beyond stipulated number of cash transactions. The limit on number of such transactions is unmanageable by anyone,” said RCCI president  .
 
 “After almost four months of demonetization, things remain unsettled at ground level. Marginal businessmen, poor and middle-class people are still at the receiving end. Almost on daily and weekly basis, some new rules are introduced,” Shah claimed in his letter to Jaitley.
 
 “We fail to understand the wisdom behind such moves, particularly after the giant step of demonetization. We observe that the dark effects of demonetization are still there on the informal economy. Whatever, GDP data reflects, but the ground reality is far worse than data of formal economy,” Shah said.
 
 He claimed that banks are doing nothing special while executing any cash transaction on behalf of account holders. “It is their prime and basic duty to fulfil. We are urging you to stop such kind of one-sided-practice. The bank should reduce their administrative expenditure and NPAs to earn more. It is ridiculous to levy charges on cash transactions,” he added.
 
 Private banks like   and ICICI, as well as public banks like   recently announced that they will levy fees of Rs 150 on deposit or withdrawal of cash from the savings accounts at bank branches beyond four to five times in a month.
