HYDERABAD: A proposal to rid Jalagam Vengal Rao (JVR) Park on Road No. 1, Banjara Hills, of pollution and stink is gathering dust.Reason: The Telangana government has been delaying sanctioning of Rs 21crore to lay new sewer trunks to divert sewer water, which has been polluting a pond, from the park.

 A month ago, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) had approached the municipal administration and urban development (MA&UD) department and had sought financial assistance to lay a new sewer network around the park. On a string of complaints by various walkers associations, MA&UD minister   had visited the park in July 2016 and asked the water board to adopt it and also prepare plans to divert sewer water entering the park from nearby slums. Accordingly, the water board has prepared a plan along with estimates to the tune of Rs 21 crore.
 
 As per the plan, the water board has to lay 1,100 mm diameter RCC sewer line from existing 1,800 mm dia main sewer line between Yashoda Hospital, Somajiguda and JVR Park and Devarakonda basthi en route   and Panjagutta to divert the sewer water from existing nalas and storm water drains. Apart from the sewer trunk mains, water board has to lay RCC sewer lines for sub mains as part of the work, sources in HMWS&SB told TOI.
 
 The water board has drawn up plans to complete the work before the onset of monsoon and cause inconvenience to the walkers. “We are pursuing the issue with the MA&UD department to start the process of floating tenders and finalise bids. Moreover, we have to take road cutting permission from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) before laying sewer line,“ he added.
 
 When contacted, directoroperations, HMWS&SB, G   said, “Several reminders have been sent.We are waiting for approval from the MA&UD officials to sanction `21 crore. Recently, the water board also approached the MA&UD secretary to get approval.“
