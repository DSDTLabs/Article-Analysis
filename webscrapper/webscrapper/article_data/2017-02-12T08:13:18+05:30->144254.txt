PUNE: Amidst the regular, frenzied activity that was her election campaign,   (MNS) corporator   delivered a baby boy in a city hospital.

 Moreover, Patil, who is seeking another term in the   (PMC), is eager to get back in the trenches. 
 
 “ I will resume my campaign two days after my doctor discharges me,” said the second-time mother, contesting from Shaniwar Peth-Narayan Peth. The candidate from Panel No. 15 had a hectic Thursday before she went into labour late at night. She delivered a healthy baby on Friday morning. 
 
 Speaking to TOI from the hospital, Patil said that the baby was born a month early — the due date was on March 5. “The rigorous campaigning and walking must have advanced the delivery by a month,” she said.
 
 After a busy morning, she took a break before resuming her door-to-door campaign in the Shukrawar Peth area. She was visiting the wadas in the area. Soon after, she attended a meeting with her party members after which she went back home. It was then that she started experiencing labour pains.
 
 “I was fortunate to reach the hospital on time. I would have delivered the baby in the vehicle, otherwise,” she said. 
 
 Prior to giving birth, Patil was following a strict regimen of diet and exercise. Post-delivery too, she said she will follow the same and with support from her family, should be able to care for her newborn alongside the rigours of election campaigning. 
 
 Patil has a six-year-old daughter, Shaurya, and her party workers are keen that she name her newborn “Ransangram”, as he was born during the campaigns. “We are deliberating on different names, but we will definitely consider this name,” she said.
