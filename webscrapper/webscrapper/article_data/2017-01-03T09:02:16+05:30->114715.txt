NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP chief   would submit a report to chief minister   on the problems faced by the people living in Inderpuri Gas Godown slum. Tiwari had stayed here on New Year’s Eve and plans to organise a fund-raiser to fix the problems should the AAP-led Delhi government fail to do so. 

 “The government has constructed a toilet block, but there is no water. How will the people use it?” said the North East Delhi MP, adding that BJP would “definitely work towards improving the situation”. 
 
 Tiwari said he had raised the issue with DJB chief  , but he had refused to even acknowledge the problem. “I told him to visit the area if he doesn’t believe me,” Tiwari said. 
 
 Mishra wasn’t available for a reaction. 
 
 The residents of the slum apparently told the actor-turned-politician about the persistent water problem. “The community centre is lying closed. There is a liquor shop in the area that should be closed immediately,” said Tiwari, who also asked MP Meenakshi Lekhi to look into the problem. 
 
 With the municipal polls around the corner, BJP has been trying to expand its footprint in slums and unauthorised colonies that are considered   strongholds. Tiwari’s night stay is one of the many events planned by BJP to appeal to this constituency. On Tuesday, he’s supposed to spend a night at Bhim Camp in Nangloi. 
 
 Elsewhere, BJP’s SC wing held an ‘aabhaar march’ from   on Mandir Marg to Dr B R Ambedkar’s statue at Jhandewalan to express gratitude to the government for naming an app after Dr Ambedkar.
