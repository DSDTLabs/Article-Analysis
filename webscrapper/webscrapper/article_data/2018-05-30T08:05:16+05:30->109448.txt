PATNA:   at various   are likely to be hit over the next two days as their employees and officers will go on a nationwide 48-hour strike from 6am on Wednesday.

 
 The call for the stir follows the Indian Banks’ Association’s (IBA) delay in resolving a charter of demands, the government’s casual approach to wage revisions for   employees and a meagre offer of a 2% hike in wage revision.
 
 Bank officials, however, claimed that ATMs would continue to work even though they won’t be refilled during the strike period. Cash was loaded in sufficient quantity in all the ATMs across the city on Tuesday.
 
 U K Singh, the president of Officers’ Association of State Bank of India, in Patna said, “Services like withdrawal, cheque clearance and deposits at different bank branches will be affected during the strike. However, online operations will have no impact.”
 
 Elaborating on the demands of the employees, Singh said, “We want that a proper and managed approach should be established for revision of wages which has not been done since November last year. If the authorities do not accept our demands, the strike will continue.”
