HYDERABAD: Villagers of   took to an unusual route to get the government to hear their grievance. The villagers who asked municipal administration minister K T   to build a road for them in return for votes got their request sanctioned, but the minister clarified that he had responded to their plea not for merely votes. 

 "Vote or no votes, providing basic infrastructure is our responsibility,"   said in response to the plea for the roads. 
 
 It was one Rakesh who posted photographs on Twitter of the women in   carrying placards and showing the condition of the road in their village. The women said that for the last 20 years they had been waiting for roads, but no government had taken interest. "At least you do it. We have great regard for you. As long as we live, we will vote for you. We are hoping you will do justice," the women said. 
 
 Responding to this, the minister asked Vikarabad collector to look into this and send proposals to the government at the earliest. Vikarabad collector   tweeted back to the minister saying that the matter would be verified and proposals would be submitted within three to four days. "Thanks collector saab," the minister tweeted in response.
