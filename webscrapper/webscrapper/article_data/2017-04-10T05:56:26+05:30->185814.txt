"We held medical camps at   and happened to figure out that most of the elderly are prone to depression. Hence, we planned to conduct an event like this," said Sweety Karnel, a volunteer. 
 
  "There is not a single day when I don't think about my children. I miss them every moment. I don't know if they also miss me the same way I do. But today, I hardly remembered them as I was busy enjoying these events," said Ranganayakamma, 67, also from Sandhya Deepa Ashram. Sundaramma, 69, said: "I make paper bags in my ashram. I'm happy to lead this life without depending on my children." 
 
  Talking about the needs of the elderly, Dr Radha Kulkarni, 78, national award-winning teacher and writer, said: "Old age is second childhood. At this age we don't need materialistic happiness, but someone to show us love. I don't have a child. Since I'm a teacher, I treat my students as my children. I always tell friends not to bother about what makes them sad, instead get involved in activities which make them feel content." 
 
  Venkat Raman, founder of  , said the elderly need the support of young people. "I'm glad that these   have invested their weekend time on elders. The younger generation must know the importance of the elderly at their homes," he said.
