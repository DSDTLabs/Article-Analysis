Prithviraj, who starts the shoot of his new film today where his co-star is the actress who was assaulted, has requested media to keep the cameras away from the shooting set. "As a friend and co-worker, I request media to not surround her with cameras. I believe the media in Kerala has the goodness to respect her privacy. She has decided to talk to the media but let her decide when," he added. 

 The film, titled Adam, is being directed by Jinu John. Earlier, the actress had decided to back out of the film but apparently, friends and family motivated her into going ahead with the shoot.
