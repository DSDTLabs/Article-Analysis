RANCHI: Bank officials sat on a dharna in front of the main branch of the important banks in the city on Thursday, demanding adequate compensation to public sector undertaking ( ) banks and employees after demonetisation.

 They will continue to hold demonstrations till February 28 and have decided to go on an indefinite strike if their demands are not met.
 
 Prashant Shandilya, deputy general secretary of All India Punjab National Bank Officer’s Association said, “Despite toiling for three months on the Prime Minister’s call for action, bank officials have not been provided any compensation for their efforts. Public sector banks have lost a lot of business due to demonetisation, however, we are being denied consolidation due to non-performing assets.”
 
 Union finance ministry officials indicated on Monday that public sector banks will not be consolidated until the situation of non-performing assets improves.
 
 On being asked why the non-performing asset has increased by Rs 79,977 crores within the last quarter, he said, “The government has provided no stringent laws to handle defaulters. Banks are left helpless when people continue to lead a lavish lifestyle despite being unable to pay the loan. Private sector banks are focussed on profits whereas public sector banks are focussed on social uplift.”
 
 Senior bank officials claimed that the government’s policy is aimed at diluting the PSUs and bringing them under the government’s control. “Lack of participation by the management, placing bureaucrats in boards of banks and the proposed reforms in labour laws by the government are aimed at diluting the public sector banks,” said Shandilya.
 
 Apart from compensation and the demand to not change labour laws, bank employees have also demanded that there should be only five working days in a week, effective appointments on compassionate grounds (recruiting a deceased employee’s family member) and filling up currently vacant positions.
