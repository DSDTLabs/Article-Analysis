Actor  , who made his Tamil debut with the Gautham Karthik-starrer  , will be making his foray into   soon. The actor will be playing the villain in Ravi Teja’s Amar Akbar  , which is being directed by Srinu Vaitla. The team has already begun shooting for the film in the US. 

 An excited Rajveer says, “I was pretty surprised when I got a call from the makers. I thought they called me after seeing Indrajith, but later, I was told that they were impressed with my performance in G Kutta Se (Haryanvi / Hindi film), which was well appreciated. I am not allowed to reveal too many details about my role; all I can say is that I play one of the villains in the film. There is one more guy... we play business partners.”
 Rajveer shot a couple of his portions in the US. “I am yet to meet   sir. We will begin our next schedule in June in the US, and he will be joining us there,” he says.
 Coming from Mumbai, Rajveer says that language was a barrier for him. “I found it difficult to get my lines right even in my Tamil film. And now, this one, too, seemed difficult. But I ensure I remember my lines before I shoot my scene. Sometimes, I find it difficult to get the diction right. But Srinu sir asked me not to concentrate on that now and focus more on getting the emotions right,” he says. 
 Though Indrajith didn’t fare too well, Rajveer is positive that he will get good roles in Kollywood. “I am happy to have worked with the best team. I am certain I will get good offers in Tamil industry,” he signs off.
