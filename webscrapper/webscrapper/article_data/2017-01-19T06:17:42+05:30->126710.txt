JAMSHEDPUR:   are planning to deploy volunteers of   (EDS), a rural tribal body, for the checking vehicles and preventing visitors from carrying liquor to the sanctuary. 

 “The EDS volunteers will levy fine on the people caught carrying alcohol to the sanctuary and shall use a percentage of the penalty amount in the welfare of the village. The remaining amount will be deposited with the department,” said a sanctuary official adding the proposal is at the approval stage. 
 
 Officials have found it hard to rein in on visitors who carry liquor bottles to the sanctuary. “Checking of vehicles is done by the security guards at all the entry points but many times visitors carrying liquor bottles speed off with their vehicles by hoodwinking the guards,” said Dalma forest ranger R P Singh. 
 
 Singh said shortage of staff poses a problem for ensuring  .“We have been requesting visitors not to carry alcohol to the sanctuary but now I think we will have to get strict with the offenders,” the ranger said. The official also added that the EDS volunteers shall only work as vigilant groups at the entry points and in the forest area. 
 
 The forest department is worried that shards of liquor bottles might injure the visitors. 
 
 According to the sanctuary officials close to 6,000 visitors visit the hill on weekends and 3,000 come on weekdays. “Mostly youths and office-goers carry liquor to the forest hill,” said a forest official.
