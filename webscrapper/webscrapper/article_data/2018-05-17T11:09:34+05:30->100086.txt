CHANDIGARH:   governor and UT administrator VP   will inaugurate the new girls’ hostel —   number 10 — at   on May 29. The hostel can accommodate as many as 400 students.

 Panjab University dean student welfare (DSW) Emanual Nahar confirmed that the construction of the hostel is complete, and it will be inaugurated on May 29. “We have invited Punjab governor and UT administrator VP Singh Badnore to inaugurate the hostel. The hostel admissions for the 2018-19 session will begin soon,” Nahar said.
 
 “The opening of this hostel will benefit 400 students of the university. Earlier, these students were forced to live in PGs which are comparatively not secure. This will prove beneficial for the girls,” said Panjab University Campus Student Council (PUCSC) secretary Vani Sood.
 
 The completion of this hostel has missed several deadlines. The hostel was scheduled to open for admissions by August end in 2017, however, the XEN office gave another deadline and had stated that the hostel will be ready by December 2017, which was also missed.
 
 There are two types of rooms in the hostel — ones with attached washroom and the others with common washrooms. The fee structure of the hostel will also be tabled in the upcoming senate meeting. The monthly rent of the rooms with common washrooms has been proposed to be Rs 200 and that of the rooms with attached washrooms will be Rs 500 per month.
 
 VC had proposed name
 
 The syndicate in its meeting on August 20, 2017, had approved to name hostel number 10 as   Hostel. Panjab University vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar Grover had proposed to name the girls’ hostel after Neerja Bhanot, who lost her life trying to save passengers aboard Pan Am Flight 73, which terrorists had hijacked during a stopover in Karachi, Pakistan, on September 5, 1986.
