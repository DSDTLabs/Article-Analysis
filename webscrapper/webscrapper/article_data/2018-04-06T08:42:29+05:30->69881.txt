AHMEDABAD: State government’s prohibition and excise department conducted a stock-taking of IMFL at Satellite-based Courtyard by Marriott hotel and allegedly found discrepancy in the stock mentioned on record and actual one. 

 A team of sub-inspector   had visited the hotel on Thursday and had checked the stock when 160 bottles of various brands of liquor were found less whereas 48 were more than the record. R S Vasava, in-charge superintendent of Ahmedabad district, said that investigation is on. 
 
 Gaurav Apte, general manager, Courtyard by Marriott, Ahmedabad, said, “As the liquor store is supervised by excise officers who open and close the liquor store themselves and there is CCTV coverage in and around the store, it eliminates any possibility of illegal sale.”
