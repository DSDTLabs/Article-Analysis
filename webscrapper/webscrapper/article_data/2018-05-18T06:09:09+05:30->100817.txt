The Congress-JDS alliance and the Anglo-Indian community association moved the Supreme Court on Thursday, challenging B S Yeddyurappa’s decision to recommend Vinisha Nero as MLA from the community.

 Joint petitioners, Karnataka Congress president G Parameshwar and JDS chief H D Kumaraswamy, moved an application challenging the decision saying there was a clear bar under Constitution and law. Justice A K Sikri will hear it on Friday with the main petition.
 
 All-India Anglo Indian Association vice-president   filed a writ petition on similar grounds. “Our nominated member should not be misused in a number game,” said Barry O’Brien, president-in-chief of the association. “We have decided to challenge any appointments of Anglo-Indians before a trust vote,” said O’Brien.
