NEW DELHI: A day after TOI reported about the sudden spurt in dengue and chikungunya in Delhi, Union health minister J P   called a meeting of top officials to review the preparedness for prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases.

 He asked the   to start ‘aggressive’ campaigns to increase awareness about preventive measures. Nadda also directed the officials to conduct regular supervisory visits to various hospitals in the national capital to assess the situation. Till April 8, this year, hospitals in Delhi reported 79 chikungunya, 24 dengue and 13 malaria cases. It is very high compared to the number of such cases reported over the last five years in the given period. “The minister asked the states for mounting aggressive information education communication campaigns to enhance awareness on prevention and control of vectors,” the ministry said, adding that secretary (health) has been asked to review the preparedness of the states through a video conference.
 
 According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, in 2016, 58,136 cases of chikungunya was reported in the country, while 1,11,880 cases of dengue leading to the death of 227 people was recorded in the same period. During Wednesday’s meeting, Nadda was informed that advisories have already been sent to all states as early as January for strengthening preparedness before the dengue season. 
 
 The officials also told the minister that teams of experts from the ministry have visited many states to review their preparedness and advised them suitably. Experts said that early action against mosquito-breeding is the only way to prevent outbreaks, which have become common in places like Delhi. Large-scale construction, poor upkeep of overhead tanks and inefficient solid waste management have been found to be the main culprits.
