CHANDRAPUR: The massive fire that gutted 29 houses left some 125 persons homeless in village Rantalodhi inside the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve on Monday. The homeless victim families have been forced to take refuge in the houses of neighbours.

 The families affected by the fire have nowhere else to go, since there is only jungle all around them for miles. 
 
 This has made it all the more important to compensate their losses and provide them houses under a government housing scheme, said Rantalodhi sarpanch Kailash Kumre while talking to TOI. 
 
 He claimed that the victim families have suffered losses to the tune of Rs5 lakh and 85 quintals of grains stored after harvest. He also demanded compensation for the cattle that died in the fire.
 
 Kumre said that the forest department has provided sleeping mats to members of the victim families. Revenue department has also arranged for food to those who have lost their houses and all their belongings. However, the monsoon is round the corner, and agriculture is the only sources of livelihood for the villagers. 
 
 They would soon need to take up agriculture operations for kharif season. There will be no place for these people to go in the rainy season if they are not provided houses under the government housing scheme, he emphasized.
 
 Zilla parishad president Devrao Bhongle also visited the village Rantalodhi on Tuesday and inspected the damage caused by the fire. He interacted with the victim families and assured them of all assistance from ZP administration.
