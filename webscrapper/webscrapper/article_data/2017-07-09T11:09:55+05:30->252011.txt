GUWAHATI: The ongoing   control programme in Assam got a shot in the arm recently by being certified as the best performer among all other states in the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme from 2015-16 to 2016-17 by the ministry of health and family welfare. 

 Assam was certified with the special recognition at the 4th National Summit on Good, Replicable Practices and Innovation in   in India held between July 6 and 8 at Indore, Madhya Pradesh.
 
 The state's innovative and different programmes that were undertaken in the past few years in combating the disease, reporting cases, introducing new drugs and other measures to prevent infections, drew attention. Officials at the TB control programme told TOI on Saturday that a slew of measures were put into action and some of them were the first of their kind in the country.
 
 In 2015, Assam became the first state in the country to launch Bedaquiline and DST Guided Treatment in the country. "There were collaborative activities with tea gardens and collaboration of Doctors For You (an NGO) for providing nutritional support for all DR-TB patients under the Drug Resistant TB centre in Guwahati, nutritional support programme in Jorhat district and others that all need special mention," said  , district TB officer, Jorhat.
 
 Other measures included collaborative activities with private healthcare providers through the Centre's 'TB notification' order, and active-case finding activities, especially in districts such as Kokrajhar, Kamrup (Metro), Sivasagar and Jorhat.
