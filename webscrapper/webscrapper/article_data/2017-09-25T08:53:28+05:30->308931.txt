CHANDIGARH: A day after Sonipat police received an anonymous email from a student of a private school in Gohana, alleging gang rape by two staff members, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed to look into the matter procured   footage of the campus on Sunday and questioned two employees whose names figured in the complaint. 

 In her email, copies of which were marked to PM  , the school director and local media, the student has alleged that a clerk and an accountant had raped her several times in the school. The police registered a case of gang rape and harassment at Gohana city police station after taking note of it. The issue of safety of school children is in focus especially after the recent killing of a 7-year-old in a Gurgaon school.
 
 SP   said besides collecting the school's digital records, the SIT also questioned the management and teachers in charge of classes. Gupta said the SIT and cops took a round of the school premises and directed the owners of local hotels to submit their records at the police station. "Since this was an anonymous complaint, we need the survivor to identify the culprits. We have conveyed this to the school and are flashing messages on social media. The aggrieved must come forward. We assure full security as well secrecy,'' said DSP Rajiv Deswal, who is heading SIT. He said police had taken the mobile details of two employees. "Investigations are in progress but it is too early to conclude anything," he added.
 
 In her email, the survivor has alleged that she was even forced by the duo to accompany them to a hotel. Referring to the school administration, the complainant alleged that her complaints to class in-charge and principal remained unheard. She has even threatened suicide, saying the school director should be held responsible for her extreme action.
