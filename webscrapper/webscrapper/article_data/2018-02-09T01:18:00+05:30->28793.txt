 Although Mumbai’s overall AQI was 268, which was in the poor category, six of the 10 locations monitored by SAFAR recorded very poor air quality levels between 301 and 400. These locations included Mazgaon in Byculla at 343, Borivli 312, Bhandup 327, Bandra-Kurla Complex 327, Colaba 323 and Navi Mumbai 319. When the AQI falls in the very poor category, people with heart or lung diseases, older adults and children should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion.
 
 Meanwhile, minimum temperatures dipped, which weathermen said was expected.

Minimum temperatures recorded in Colaba were 2.1 degree Celsius below normal and at Santacruz one degree.   temperatures saw a slight dip too. 
 
 Ajay Kumar, scientist, IMD Mumbai, said, “There was a deep trough in the westerlies, which has become less marked and is seen as an upper air cyclonic circulation. The wind pattern has changed from easterly to westerly. The pollution is expected to move away because of this.”   at Colaba was 67% and Santacruz 52%.
