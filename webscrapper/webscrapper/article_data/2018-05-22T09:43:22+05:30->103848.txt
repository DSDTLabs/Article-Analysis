NEW DELHI: On back of a five-day losing streak, the markets are still reeling under pressure as equity benchmarks opened in the red on Tuesday morning.

 
 30-share BSE   opened with minor losses, a shade above 34,600-mark but as it extended the slippage early on, it did not take long for the index to slide below the psychological mark. The broader 50-share NSE   too, was under pressure and testing the 10,500-milestone.
 
 Political uncertainty and macroeconomic cues like the weakening of   have taken a heavy toll on the Street since last week and despite an impressive showing by state-run bank stocks on Monday, indices failed to turn green.
 
 Tuesday morning proved that the euphoria in   scrips was a short-lived one as the respective sectoral sub-index underwent correction, losing more than a per cent. None of the other sub-indices were making gains either.
 
 Dr Reddy, Tata Motors and Bajaj Auto were the top performing stocks.
