PATNA: Deputy CM   on Friday said   streetlights would soon be installed in all municipal corporations and urban local bodies in the state to save power as part of the Centre’s   (SLNP).

 Modi said Centre has put added emphasis on replacement of traditional bulbs used for streetlights in the country with LED lights, as it would save 9,000 million units of power in the country.
 
 “Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a joint venture of public sector companies of ministry of power, would soon start installing new LED streetlights in the state. A survey by EESL in the localities under Biharsharif Municipal Corporation showed that the civic body would save Rs 1.31 crore annually by installing LED streetlights,”   added.
 
 He added after the state cabinet gives its nod to implementation of SLNP in the state, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) would be signed with EESL in this regard. “LED lights would be fixed on all electric poles in towns in three phases. The streetlights would be replaced within 72 hours, if needed,” the deputy CM said.
 
 The EESL would enter into separate agreements with municipal corporations and urban local bodies for implementation of SLNP, Modi added. The salient features of the new facility were discussed at a meeting held by state urban development and housing department minister Suresh Sharma on Friday. EESL representatives also attended the meeting.
 
 Officials said EESL will replace traditional street bulbs with LED lights in the first phase. In the second phase, LED lights will be fixed on all the poles which do not have streetlights. Finally, electric poles would be erected in the untouched areas in the third phase and LED lights will be installed.
 
 Meanwhile, the deputy CM, who was recently made convener of the group of state finance ministers to look into problems related to GST Network (GSTN), left for Bengaluru on Friday to attend a meeting.
