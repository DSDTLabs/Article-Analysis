PANAJI: A group of agitated villagers from   grilled the panchayat’s secretary and staff on Tuesday about what they alleged was an “arbitrary and non-transparent process of delimitation” of the seven-ward local body.

 The villagers have been gathering at the panchayat over the last couple of days, as they are irked by the   process. “The geographical boundaries have not been considered and houses from one ward have been deliberately included in another to serve vested interests,” advocate Chiara   said.
 
 The interchanging of houses or voters is not justified and carried out without consulting villagers, they alleged.
 
 “We are yet to know in which ward we have been included as voters because the process of delimitation has not been transparent,”  , a villager, said.
 
 The islanders questioned the secretary about the delimitation and blamed him for the arbitrary alterations. He, however, denied it and passed the buck on to the panchas, who in turn blamed him.
 
 “The secretary and the staff of the village panchayat are not cooperating with villagers in perusing the electoral rolls,” a villager alleged.
 
 The villagers have petitioned the directorate of panchayats to intervene and revert the delimitation on the pattern followed in the year 2012, which was as per geographical boundaries.
 
 On May 15, residents of Pilgao threatened to boycott the panchayat elections scheduled for June 11 if the discrepancies they found in the delimitation process were not rectified. They had accused the panchayat secretary of shifting 24 voters from Gaonkarwada to Tarwada and vice versa.
