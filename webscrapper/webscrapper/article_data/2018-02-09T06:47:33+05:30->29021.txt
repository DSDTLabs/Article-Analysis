AHMEDABAD: Students leaders of both the   (ABVP) and the   (NSUI) cried foul as soon as the   (GU) on Thursday released the voters list for 10 senate and 14 welfare seats. Both the student unions alleged that names of their voters have been deleted.

 The unions have made representations to the university authorities in this connection. GU officials said this year, in order to avoid any kind of allegations, the university had prepared a list of voters with their photographs. 
 
 According to the university, there are 2,136 voters for the 10 senate seats and 1,279 for the 14 welfare seats. The elections will be held on March 25.
 
  This is after three years that the university has announced the student elections. The counting will be held on the next day of the polls.
