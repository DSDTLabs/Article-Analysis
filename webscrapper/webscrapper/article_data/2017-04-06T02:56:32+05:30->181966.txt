NEW DELHI: For the second consecutive year the number of   for admission to   ( ) has dropped — that too quite significantly — this year.

 However, with the   in the number of   the competition actually got tougher as for each seat now there are approximately 30 aspirants, as against 28 last year.
 
 Till Wednesday noon — the final day for submission of the online application forms — nearly 55,000 applications were received, JNU sources said. In 2015-16 the university received the highest number of applications – over 79,000. Thereafter, the numbers have gone down and this year has been the lowest in the last six years.
 
 A JNU official said that one of the reasons for the decline “could be the reduction in the number of MPhil and PhD seats. Otherwise the number of applications for the undergraduate and master’s programmes have increased and a final analysis can be done only after the application process ends.”
 
 Whether the turmoil in the campus in the last one year has also affected the number of applications can only be ascertained after an analysis of the region-wise data. “Region-wise and programme-wise analysis will give a clearer picture of the reason behind the decline,” said an admission branch official.
 
 The university, which has been in the limelight ever since the February 9, 2016 event to protest the hanging of parliament attack mastermind Afzal Guru, have also seen a decline in the number of seats of research programmes by approximately 900. Therefore instead of 2,700 seats offered last year, there will be around 1,800 admissions this year.
 
 “Parents of aspirants from remote areas could be apprehensive, but the campus remains unaffected. It has continued to do well as amid all these political turmoil it bagged the Visitor’s award as the best university as well as the highest ranked central university in the India Rankings 2017,” said a senior official.
