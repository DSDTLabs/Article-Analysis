AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday found allegations of eve teasing against four senior citizens a little amusing, as Justice   recalled the 1982 Hindi comedy film ‘Shaukeen’.

 After the four accused pleaded to quash the complaint, the judge asked the assistant public prosecutor if the FIR against the senior citizens inspired any confidence. The HC allowed the probe to continue, but stayed the arrest of the ‘Shaukeens’ at this stage.
 
 This case is from Vadodara, where four senior citizens – Purushottam Limbachiya, Ghanshyam Patel, Ramesh Parekh and   – were booked by   police under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), for sexual harassment and criminal conspiracy. The allegations were made by a person whose 15-year-old niece complained that the quartet passed lewd comments and one of them even made obscene gestures at her.
 
 All four have filed a petition requesting the HC to junk the FIR, terming it false and malafide. As soon as their advocate,  , got up to argue the case, Justice Pardiwala made a light comment that the story reminded him of the Hindi movie ‘Shaukeen’, in which three lecherous old men decide to go on a pleasure trip late in their lives. As the hearing proceeded, Purohit submitted that the complainant in this case has criminal antecedents, and by the FIR against the four senior citzens, criminal colour was given to a civil dispute. He said that the senior citizens are so feeble that they can’t even walk properly.
 
 The lawyer further submitted that the investigating officer has deleted section 8 of POCSO and substituted it with sections 11(2) and 12, which are milder. 
 
 The court posted further hearing on this case for June, and the state government has been asked to file its reply by then.
