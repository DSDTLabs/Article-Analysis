JAMSHEDPUR: The decision of the   (SER) to discontinue the Shalimar-Jaipur (08061/08062) weekly   services from May 22 has failed to go down well with commuters of the  . 

 While railway officials claimed the decision was taken due to poor passenger response, however, commuters denied said that several people remained unaware of the services. "The number of passengers will increase once people get to know about these services. In any case, the train services shouldn't be terminated midway," investment consultant  , who travelled to Jaipur, said.
 
 A section of the passengers have also reportedly urged railway authorities to popularise the train to augment traffic, instead of withdrawing services. "SER should promote the summer special train and work towards lowering the fares to increase passenger traffic. Announcing the withdrawal date is not the solution," entrepreneur Vijay Anand Moonka said.
 
 Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), who had earlier played an important role in convincing zonal rail officials to introduce the train to Jaipur via Tatanagar, has decided to discuss the ongoing issue with higher authorities to halt its immediate withdrawal.
 
 "The special train should be allowed to operate till June 28 as announced earlier," SCCI president Suresh Sonthalia said. Sonthalia also requested officials to add few sleeper coaches to the special train to tackle the rush during the peak season.
 
 Jamshedpur   MP, Bidyut Baran Mahato, said he will try to ensure the train service is not disrupted. "I will take up the matter with authorities at the zonal railway users consultative meeting on May 17. If required, I will approach the railway board to ensure the services are continued," Mahato said.
