 HYDERABAD: Easter is round the corner and the Christian community in Hyderabad is ready to celebrate the “new beginning of life” after the 40-day-long Lent fasting.
 
 The celebrations on April 1will start with sunrise services in the churches at four in the morning, followed by feasts and family gatherings.
 
 For people like Christine  , 66, Easter evokes nostalgia. “When I was a child, my grandfather used to boil eggs and paint them on Easter, and those were our Easter eggs,” said Lazares, a former nominated MLA from the Anglo Indian community.
 
 “Though the fun during Easter is not anything like Christmas, Jesus’ rebirth is more important than his birth, therefore Easter is merrier than Christmas for many people.” added Lazares.The celebration of Easter is incomplete without the long period of mourning called Lent and the Holy Week, beginning with Palm Sunday from March 25 this year, leading to Easter on April 1.
 
 Even bakeries in the city are prepared to meet the demand. “Though the orders during Easter are less than Christmas, we do prepare Easter eggs, cookies and gift hampers, and we get a good number of orders,” said Poonam Maria Prem, owner of Zoey’s Bake House.
