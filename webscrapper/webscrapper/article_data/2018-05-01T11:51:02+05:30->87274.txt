It was an evening when some of the top city models — from those who ruled the roost in the 90s to those who are scorching the ramp now — gathered under a roof for a fun event. While the girls got nostalgic and shared interesting anecdotes,  , who recently completed 25 years in the fashion industry, also joined them in narrating stories. The do was a friendly and casual affair, and the guests dressed in sync with the mood. 

 While Sherin and Pradaini kept it simple, yet chic, Aishvarya and   gave their ensembles an edgy twist. We spotted Ashwini and Pearl engaging in some fun banter, and Amala and Krupa seemed to have a fun time as well. Shvetha Jaishankar, Rehane, Sidney, Raji Anand, Kenith, Prajanya, Sheryl, Veenita and Rachel were among others who were spotted at the do, enjoying the company of other guests.
