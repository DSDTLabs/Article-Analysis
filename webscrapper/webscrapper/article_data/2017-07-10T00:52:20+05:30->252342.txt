Coimbatore: City school students will be treated to an exciting new world of news and features tailor made for them beginning Monday as Times of India launches its student edition.

 This customised newspaper for school children will be packed with content aimed at smarter and superior learning experience. The student edition is brought under Times Newspaper in Education ( ), a novel holistic programme where teachers can use it as a lively and interactive tool in classrooms.
 
 Times NIE programme, adapted from an international concept of newspaper in education, was initiated in India in 1985. Now, there are 2,700 schools and nine lakh students subscribing to the programme across 14 cities — New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai, Jaipur, Nagpur, Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. Coimbatore will now join the league of cities covered by NIE.
 
 The content in Times NIE is crafted to enable classroom discussions and thus help enrich the knowledge of the students. NIE gives education a new dimension by fostering the habit of reading, which in turn makes the student become well-informed and confident individual.
 
 Teachers will benefit too since NIE will provide them with an exciting teaching vehicle for lessons in history, mathematics, current affairs, environment and what not. Times NIE will also cover the events in city schools.
 
 Times NIE also hopes to build a sense of community among the city schools by conducting regular intra-school quizzes and music, drawing and painting competitions. There will be workshops for teachers conducted by professionals. Development programmes conducted by experts will cover extra-curricular interests and career counselling.
 
 Times NIE has bagged prestigious awards in recognition of its service. The most recent one was in 2013 when World Association for Newspaper acclaimed Times NIE as the “world’s best youth engagement programme”.
