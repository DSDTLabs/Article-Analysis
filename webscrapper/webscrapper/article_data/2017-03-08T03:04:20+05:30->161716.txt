MUMBAI: Amid the anxiety of HSC paper leaks, SSC examination in the city was off to a smooth start, except for four instances of copying and a delayed start at a centre.

 At a centre in Khopoli, the examination began 50 minutes late because the   meant for the 300 students there was sent to another centre. “The question paper bundle was brought back to the   by 11.50am. Students were given extra time to complete their paper,” said Siddheshwar Chandekar, secretary of the board’s Mumbai division.
 
 On Tuesday, over 2.2 lakh students appeared for their first language paper, except for those appearing from the English language. The Mumbai division recorded four cases of cheating—one during the morning session and three in the afternoon session—on Tuesday. A total of 47 cases of cheating were reported from across the state.
 
 The new activity-based paper pattern, which was introduced for languages this year, had caused some anxiety among students but they found it to be easier compared to the old format. 
 
 Arpita Omble, a student of Swami Vivekanand School in Vashi said, “The format was new to us, but we had attempted it during prelims. The new pattern meant you didn’t have to study all year for the language but write from what you understand and be creative.” 
 
 Meanwhile, the state board’s divisional helpline was buzzing through the day with complaints about lost hall tickets, queries about timetable and last-minute preparation tips.
 
 In Bhiwandi, a few autorickshaw unions went on a flash strike following RTO’s action against 200 drivers, which inconvenienced SSC students trying to reach their exam centre. The Bhiwandi Taluka Chalak Malak Mahasangh, the umbrella body of 21 rickshaw unions, operated 50 free services for students. Even locals offered to drive students to their exam centres.
