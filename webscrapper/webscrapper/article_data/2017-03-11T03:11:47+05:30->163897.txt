NEW DELHI: The   as well as the municipal corporations failed to implement many mandatory provisions of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, between 2010 and 2016, partly because the union government had provided inadequate, and sometimes delayed, funds. In its report on Friday, CAG noted these lapses and concluded that “effective implementation of the RTE Act in Delhi suffered due to poor planning and preparation, continuing vacancies as well as delay in release of funds and its utilisation”.

 Highlighting the financial inadequacies as well as spending anomalies, the report said that while “there were delays and short release of funds” by the union HRD ministry and the directorate of education for the Universalisation of Elementary Education Mission (UEEM), only Rs 647.5 crore was disbursed against the approved Rs 1,115.7 crore. CAG noted that even of the lesser amount released, “UEEM actually spent only Rs 534.29 crore”.
 
 The report said that Rs 57 lakh was given to the capital’s five urban local bodies in July 2015 under UEEM for a household survey to gather data on children up to the age of 14 as mandated by the RTE Act. Till July 2016, however, only the East Delhi Municipal Corporation and Delhi Cantonment Board had completed the exercise.
 
 The RTE Act aims to retain student and reduce dropout rate, but CAG observed contrary figures in government institutions in the 2010-16 period. Citing data from 60 schools, CAG said 1,477 children (1.99%) left government schools against a total enrolment of 74,291 children in the given period. In the schools run by the municipal corporations, the dropout rate grew to 10.43% in 2015-16, the audit report said.
 
 This was accompanied by significant decrease in enrolment, with an overall decline of 13.15% in the last five years. In contrast, private schools increased their enrolment by 34.69% in the same period.
 
 CAG also highlighted the non-utilisation of almost 55% of the funds provided for activities such as computer aided learning, community mobilisation, research, evaluation, monitoring and supervision, and inclusive education for child with special needs.
 
 In its audit on the adequacy of infrastructure in schools, CAG found that 937 of 1,317 (71%) projects on the construction of classrooms, 171 of 271 (63%) related to construction of toilet blocks and 13 of 18 (72%) for the construction of boundary walls were not executed by the municipal corporations till July 2016.
