HYDERABAD: Demanding an apology from the vice-chancellor of   for 'insulting' Kargil martyrs, students on Monday took out a rally from   to North Gate on the varsity campus. 

 A row erupted last week over a Kargil memorial on campus which put students and varsity officials at loggerheads.
 
 On Monday, the students said they had not given any representation separately to the university as their demands were in the public domain. Taking cue from other universities, they said UoH too should have installed a wall of martyrs.
 
 "It is very surprising that people are divided on the issue and are calling us pseudo-nationalists. We want to know from them what's their idea of nationalism? For us it is very painful to see our martyrs, who have sacrificed their lives for the nation, being disrespected this way and we demand an apology from vice-chancellor P   for insulting Kargil martyrs," said P  , president,   (ABVP), UoH.
 
 The varsity for its part said that the rally and protests were just vote-bank politics and aimed at attracting new students. "The students started their rally at around 7pm and it went off peacefully," said T V Rao, chief security officer of UoH. He said that it was up to the college management to take a decision on the students' demands. The students have also demanded that the varsity install the national flag within campus.
