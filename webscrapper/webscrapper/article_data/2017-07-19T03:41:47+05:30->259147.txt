 Bihar Police’s DSP (vigilance)  , who investigated the infamous minor rape case against  , was on Tuesday provided security after she feared threat to her life from the incarcerated legislator.
 
  Mridula was the IO (investigating officer) of the February 2016 case of Nalanda district. Having evaded police for a month, the Nawada MLA had on March 10 surrendered after a police team led by Mridula attached his property from his Nawada house in which the rape allegedly took place.
  
  The MLA, who has since been suspended from RJD, is currently lodged in the Biharsharif jail after the Supreme Court in November last year cancelled his bail granted by the Patna high court.
  
  Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said the DSP, currently posted at the state police HQ, submitted a petition to him on Tuesday, apprehending threat from the MLA. “A bodyguard has been provided to her,” the SSP said.
  
  It could not be immediately known if the MLA spoke with the DSP to threaten her. Asked about it, she told TOI, “I do not want to speak to the media on the issue.”
  
  A day before on Monday, IG (prisons) Anand Kishor passed orders to forcibly retire Motilal, the then superintendent of Biharsharif jail, after an inquiry found him guilty of having facilitated a special feast for Rajballabh inside the jail on the occasion of Holi festival.
  
  The MLA has been charge-sheeted in the case as the IO found the accusation against him true. “The trial in a Biharsharif court is over with the conclusion of arguments from the prosecution and defence counsel on Monday. We expect the judgment within a fortnight,” Nalanda SP Kumar Ashish told this newspaper over the phone on Tuesday evening.
