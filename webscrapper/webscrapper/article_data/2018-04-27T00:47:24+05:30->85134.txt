Madurai: The central and state governments have been issued a notice on a PIL (public interest litigation) filed by the general secretary of MDMK Vaiko seeking direction to them not to give environment clearance to Sterlite Industries and to close the existing industry. 

 When the case came up for hearing before the division bench of justices C T Selvam and A M Basheer Ahamed of the Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Thursday, senior counsel Ajmalkhan, appearing for the petitioner told the court that the environmental clearance, granted by the central and state government already to the company came to end on March 31 last. Now, no clearance is given to it. 
 
 The petitioner further pointed out that in the beginning the petitioner had already filed a case before the high court bench seeking closure of the industry in 1997 and the court on September 28, 2010 ordered for closure. Aggrieved over it, when the company went to the Supreme Court, the court set aside the direction of the high court, but made it clear that its judgment would not stand in the way of the TNPCB issuing directions to the company including for closure of the plant for the protection of environment in accordance with law. 
 
 The petitioner sent a representation to the central and stateâ€™s environment and forest secretaries, pollution control boards chairmen and Tuticorin district collector on April 8 to take steps to close the units. But, there was no action on it. 
 
 The government told the court that the pollution control board did not renew the licence and not give nod for its expansion. Following it, the court ordered notice.
