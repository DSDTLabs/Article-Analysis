CHENNAI: About 20 new Tamil films are awaiting release in theatres but the strike called by   (TFPC) has held them back forcing city theatres to depend on Hindi and English films for content. The release of the much-awaited Rajinikanth-starrer ‘Kaala’, slated to hit the screens on April 27, may get delayed due to the ongoing strike, say film exhibitors.

 According to R   of Tamil Nadu Film Exhibitors Association, about 500 of the 1,069 cinema hallsin TamilNaduhave shut down as the footfalls have come down since March 1. Film exhibitors said there was only 5-10% occupancy due to the strike. Out of the 1,069 screens, about 80% depend on Tamil content. Around 200 Tamil films release every year.
 
 
 Paneerselvam, who runs   in Koyambedu, said, “Business was bad last weekend. This weekend it has been even worse. We have shut two out of the six screens in our complex. We are forced to run older films like ‘Theri’ and ‘Baashha’ as there are no new releases. Towards operational costs, I am suffering a loss of Rs 40,000 every day.”
 
 Among the month-old Tamil films playing in city theatres are ‘Kalakalappu 2’ (released on February 9) and ‘Naachiyaar’ (released on February 16). Older films like ‘Mersal’ and ‘Vedhalam’ are also being played in city theatres.
 
 TFPC is on strike to demand the removal of   (VPF) charged by digital service providers (DSPs) such as Qube and UFO. Now, the film exhibitors have decided to go on strike from March16 to pressure the state government to remove the 8% local body tax. The film industry already pays a 28% Goods and Services Tax (GST).
 
 Tamil films awaiting release include the ‘Karu’, ‘Iravukku Ayiram Kangal’, ‘Pakka’, ‘Tik Tik Tik’ and ‘Bhaskar Oru Rascal’. Panneerselvam said, “Release of ‘Kaala’ will be delayed most likely to accommodate the films in line. Its release may be pushed to June.”
