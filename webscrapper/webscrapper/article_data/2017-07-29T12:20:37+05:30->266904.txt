BHUBANESWAR: To tide over the  , the   of the police has decided to organize voluntary blood donation camps once a week. At present, the twin city police hold such camps only four or five times a year.

 Besides, the police will bear the treatment costs of 100 poor thalassaemia patients.
 
 "We will launch a special campaign to make Bhubaneswar a no-blood deficiency zone by mid-2018. We face a shortage of nearly 20,000 units of blood every year. The shortfall arises between March and July as college students, who form the bulk of voluntary blood donors, are unavailable due to closure of educational institutions," said commissioner Y B Khurania.
 
 Police collect nearly 2,000 units of blood in each camp. In Bhubaneswar, nearly 85,000 units of blood are used for patients in a year. The state generates around 2.7 lakh units of blood through various voluntary initiatives annually, as against a requirement of around 4.2 lakh units. The police give the collected blood to the blood bank at the state-run  . Every day, nearly 100 patients use the hospital's blood bank. 
 
 Khurania said awareness campaigns would be launched to sensitize people. "We need adequate number of donors too. We will reach out to the public to help us generate blood. We will also prepare a list of donors having rare blood groups," he said. 
 
 In 2015, the ruling BJD had launched the   programme and held mega blood donation camps across the state. Last year, the health and family welfare department had introduced Nucleic Acid Testing-Polymerase Chain Reaction blood testing facility at Capital Hospital to ensure safe blood transfusion.
