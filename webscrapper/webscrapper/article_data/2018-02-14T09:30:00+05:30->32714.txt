GURUGRAM: The police’s search for the men who had molested a communications executive of   origin and assaulted her friend proved easier than thought, thanks to a  .

 A police team searching for the suspects in   spotted the dog at Sanjay dhaba which, as it turned out, is owned by the father of Vinod, one of the five men they were looking for.
 
 In her complaint to the police, the 32-year-old executive had mentioned a man wearing a red shirt, who had brought along two German shepherds, among the molesters. She and her male colleague, who is Indian, had stopped at Manesar to take some pictures on their way back to Gurugram from Jaipur on February 10 afternoon when the five men began harassing them. One of the men was taking pictures and videos of the woman and her colleague on his phone. When they objected, the group turned abusive and violent. “They had come with the intention to molest her. Had we been farther away from the road, they would have taken us with them,” the woman’s colleague had told TOI on Monday. This happened near the government polytechnic college, a few minutes’ drive from NH-8.
 
 The woman and her colleague managed to fend them off, run to their car and call the police. Later, when the police returned to the area with them, the German shepherd was the biggest clue. And as luck would have it, the dog was tied outside the dhaba when a police team went to check. The cops had expected a bigger search and had asked about the dogs at a few places. “When we reached Sanjay dhaba, the woman identified the German shepherd. That led us to the accused,” said the investigating officer.
 
 After Vinod, Rakesh, Sandeep and Jitender were arrested on Sunday. Mukesh, a fifth suspect, is absconding. “We are conducting raids at various places to nab him,” said inspector  , SHO of  .
