NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) doublespeak on empty coffers is nowhere more evident than in the largesse doled out to impress ruling party. While constantly wailing about the lack of funds, even rationalizing posts and development works, the civic administration has found money to renovate mayor’s office, standing committee and ruling party offices.

 The civic body has been spending Rs5 lakh of hard-earned public money for the renovation of mayor’s office. “NMC usually renovates mayor’s office when a new one is elected. The renovation work commenced on Thursday. The main chamber is getting a fresh coat of paint. Three other rooms attached to the mayor’s office including meeting hall are also being spruced up,” a senior officer from   said. 
 
 Similarly, the NMC has also taken up the work of renovating the chamber and antechamber of the ruling party leader. Here, even a portion of record room section has been procured and the work of its extension is under progress.
 
  Employees’ Union president Jammu Anand termed this move a gross misuse of the public money. He questioned the need to have such an expensive renovation in the Mayor’s office. He also pointed out that in the recent past, the NMC has crossed all limits of wasting taxpayers’ hard-earned money and cited the examples of various civic services being privatized.
 
 “Not only civic officials, even elected public representatives should also be blamed for waste of taxpayers money,” a Sahakar Nagar resident Arun Ingle said. According to him, these people are enjoying five-star facilities at the cost of taxpayers’ money.
 
 He also questioned the integrity of the civic body, saying, “How can a poor civic body, which cannot even provide basic amenities to the residents despite taking property tax and other cess, has approved such a decision to renovate the offices, which were already in good condition.”
 
 One side, the NMC is sealing properties to collect property tax for the development and on the other it is spending the hard-earned public money lavishly, he said.
 
 A   resident Yogesh Sapkale said, “If the mayor really wants to listen to public, she should organize an open darbar and listen to grievances there. Instead of wasting public money on renovation, the NMC should spend on repairing street lights, providing clean drinking water and other basic amenities for the residents.”
 
 He further said the NMC doesn’t have money for the public works but when it comes to spending on its officials, it does it lavishly.
