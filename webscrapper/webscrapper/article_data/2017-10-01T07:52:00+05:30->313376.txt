GURUGRAM: Students of   celebrated the festival season with a difference as they visited the Tau Devi Lal old-age home and performed   for the inmates.

 The students spent over two hours interacting with the senior citizens there. A jazz performance led by Rainer Langhans, head of music at Lancers International, was put up to entertain them.
 
 "It was an enriching experience to visit an old-age home and interact with the elders. These elders are lonely and neglected by society. One must never forget the contribution of elders who play an instrumental role in our upbringing and shape our personality," said Jaden Thomas, a Class 8 student of   School.
 
 The inmates of the old-age home showered praises on the students. "We appreciate that the students took out their valuable time for us. It is always thrilling to watch students growing up," said Prema Devi, an inmate of Tau Devi Lal.
 
 Kovida Chikara, a student who participated in the event, said, "Celebrating the festive season with the elderly people was a great experience. They were hearing jazz music for the first time in their life. They were very curious and inquisitive about the music form."
