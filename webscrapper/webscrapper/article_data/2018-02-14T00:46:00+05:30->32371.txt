Chennai: A Bar Council of India (BCI) move deferring its decision on the resolution passed by the special committee of the Tamil Nadu and Puducherry Bar Council prescribing certain amendments to its   rules, has been   by Madras high court.

 A division bench of Justice C T Selvam and Justice N Sathish Kumar passed the interim order on a plea moved by advocate V Vasanthakumar assailing the order of the BCI dated February 4.
 
 On January 24, the special committee brought in various amendments to the election rules, according to which lawyers with less than 10 years of practise and those occupying posts in political parties were restrained from contesting bar elections.
 
 Subsequently, the rules were sent to the BCI for its approval. But without taking any decision on the ratification of the rules, the BCI passed an order deferring its decision.
 
 “The BCI’s order is arbitrary and against well settled principles of law and long line of precedents. BCI seems to be indifferent in implementing the objectives of the Bar Council of India Rules in so far as conduct of elections to uphold the standards of the profession.
 
 The order is precipitous and in violation of chapter II of the Bar Council of India Rules” advocate S Jonh J Raja Singh for the petitioner said.
 
 The bench ordered notice to the BCI and posted the plea to March 1 for further hearing. tnn
