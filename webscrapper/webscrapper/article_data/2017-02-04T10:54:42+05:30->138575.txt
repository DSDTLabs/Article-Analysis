UNITED NATIONS: The UN has removed Afghan warlord Gulbuddin   from its list of designated terrorists, lifting the assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo imposed on the insurgent leader who has signed a peace pact with the government.

 The Security Council's al-Qaeda sanctions committee concerning ISIS, al-Qaeda and associated individuals, groups, undertakings and entities removed Hekmatyar's name from the   (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions List here yesterday.
 
 "Therefore, the assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo set out in paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 2253 (2015) no longer apply to him," the Sanctions Committee said in a statement.
 
 In details mentioned about the 67-year-old, the statement said Hekmatyar was listed on February 20, 2003 and was "believed to be in the Afghanistan/Pakistan border area as at January 2011."
 
 Hekmatyar, head of the Hezb-e-Islami party, had last year in September signed a landmark peace agreement with Kabul. He is expected to return to the country within weeks.
 
 A former Prime Minister, Hekmatyar was a prominent anti-Soviet commander in the 1980s.
 
 Following the 2001 US-led invasion of   and fall of the Taliban, the US State Department designated him a terrorist, accusing him of taking part in and supporting attacks by al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
