PANAJI: Goa Pradesh   Committee (GPCC) general secretary   on Thursday said chief minister   should immediately drop panchayat minister   from the cabinet considering the complaint he had filed against Godinho in the multi-crore power scam case.

 “If his complaint is genuine, he should drop Godinho,” Chodankar said, pointing out that both, the complainant and accused, are presently together in the cabinet.
 
 The AICC secretary further said the government didn’t have the right to celebrate Opinion Poll Day “when it has, in fact, not considered the opinion of the people on the casino issue,   water issue or river nationalisation”. When asked whether the Congress supports the striking tourist taxi operators, Chodankar said the party “will definitely stand by them”. “The government must humble itself and try and understand their grievances,” he said, alleging that it was using its might to bully them instead.
