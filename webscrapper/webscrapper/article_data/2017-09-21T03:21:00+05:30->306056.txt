Panaji: The Corporation of the city of Panaji (CCP) and the directorate of municipal administration (DMA) appear to be locked in a ‘chicken or egg’ situation over the Panaji municipal market logjam.

 Nearly 20 days after the directorate of municipal administration urged the CCP to sign fresh lease agreements with the tenants of the new Panaji municipal market, the city mayor Surendra Furtado has pointed out that the DMA had yet to approve the leave and licence agreement that the tenants have to sign with CCP.
 
 “Some of the terms of the draft leave and licence were modified and the same have been resubmitted for government approval in May,” Furtado said.
 
 Furtado has written to the DMA asking for the draft leave and licence agreements to be ratified so that CCP could go ahead and sign fresh agreements with the tenants of the municipal market.
 
 “I shall be obliged if the government approval for the modified leave and licence agreement is expedited so that this corporation can execute the agreements with the legal tenants of the market and recover the arrears of rent in the market,” Furtado said in a letter addressed to the director of municipal administration Ashok Kumar.
 
 Interestingly, on September 2, Kumar had written to CCP and said, “It is advised that the corporation takes sincere efforts to resolve the issue of signing of lease agreements with the allottees and recover all dues payable by the defaulters.”
