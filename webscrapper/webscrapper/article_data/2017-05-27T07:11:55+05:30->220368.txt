CUTTACK: The state government had three years ago announced to install water meters in all households in Cuttack to ensure  . But the project is yet to see the light of the day.

 The water meters were supposed to address the problem of loss of revenue due to wastage of water. The government had plans to install water meters in a phase-wise manner in residential and commercial facilities.
 
 Meanwhile, public health engineering organisation (PHEO) officials claimed that they had floated tenders for selecting agencies to carry out installation of water meters in households in Cuttack, but authorities have asked them to suspend the work for the time being. 
 
 "We had invited tenders for the project. But we were directed to cancel the process," said executive engineer, PHEO(Cuttack division), Sushant Ghadei. Official sources said the government wants to implement the project on a priority basis in Bhubaneswar and after assessing the pros and cons it will be implemented in Cuttack.
 
 However, PHEO's chief engineer   has claimed that government wants to implement the project properly to ensure its effectiveness and durability. "The project will be of no use if it is implemented haphazardly. All the wards in Cuttack are not supplied with pipe water facility so we cannot install water meters in all households. On a priority basis, piped water will be ensured in all wards and then water meters will be installed," said Laxmipati. He claimed that in first phase water meters will be installed in commercial establishments using bulk water then the project will be extended to households. 
 
 At present, piped water is supplied to 44 of the 59 wards of the  . As many as 13 wards under its jurisdiction are partially covered, while the remaining two wards have no access to piped water supply. PHEO officials said there are around 60,000 legal water connections in Cuttack while over 12,000 households use water connections illegally.
