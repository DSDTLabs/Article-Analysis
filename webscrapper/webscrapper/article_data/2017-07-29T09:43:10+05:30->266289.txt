JAIPUR: Important safety arrangements were not made by the   administration during the mountaineering trials held for students to witness adventure sports on July 26. A 19-year-old girl had slipped to death from the university’s roof which prompted cops to file an FIR against the university and the instructor.

 The lapses in safety were brought to light during police investigation, ACP Mansarovar, Deshraj Yadav said that cops will also issue a notice to the university and asked them to explain the safety arrangements being made.
 
 “There should have been a safety net, ambulances and fire tenders present on the spot. Our investigation suggests no such arrangements were made on that day,” Yadav said.
 
 The cops said they have found ‘glaring negligence’ on account of the university and trainer Sunil Sanghi. On the morning of July 26, 19-year-old Aditi Sanghi lost her balance and fell from the sixth floor of the building. She was among several students gathered to witness trials for the mountaineering sport. The girl’s father,  , himself was training the students when the mishap took place.
 
 The cops inspected the university and found that lives of many students were risked as they were allowed to stand on the roof of the university. “The height of the roof’s wall was merely one feet. There were no railings either, imagine if there was a stampede, many more students would have died or sustained severe injuries,” added police official.
 
 The university also failed to inform government authorities about the training session being organized at the university campus. “As per the rules, ambulance and fire officials should have been deployed inside the university campus when the accident took place,” Yadav added. The Jaipur police have already filed an FIR against administration and Sunil Sanghi under sections 336 (Act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 304A (causing death by negligence).
