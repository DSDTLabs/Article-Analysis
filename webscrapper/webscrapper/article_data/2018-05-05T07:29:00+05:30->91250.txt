GURUGRAM: Corporate life can often be hectic with untimely meetings, presentations, round-the-year travel for work and networking with new people. 

 However, the   28°North gave   a chance to take a break and relive their younger days. Held on May 3 and 4 at DLF Cyber Hub, it gave them a platform to show off their talents in fields ranging from music to quizzing to photography.
 
 The second season of the festival had promised to be different from the first one. From solo singing to open stage (including dance, playing an instrument, mime, standup comedy etc) to checking out one’s IQ in a quiz on cricket, food and travel to walking on the ramp and brining out the oomph factor, the festival engaged corporates in a variety of activities this year. 
 
  
  For the first time, there was a new addition to the festival, ‘Pro Chat’, which included sessions by experts. Those who have already achieved success in their respective fields came and shared their experiences, tips and tricks to make it big in the corporate world with the audience. Answering queries on how to achieve goals, one of the panellist at ‘Pro-Chat’, Iqbal Singh, who used to work with   and now mentors startups, said, “Follow your passion and you will be amazed at what you can do.”
 
 Swati Bhargava, another panelist, who has an online site called Cashkaro — a cashback and coupons business, said, “Just focus on your achievements.”
 
 The day ended with a music performance by fusion band Mrigya with members bringing together violin and guitar currents. 
 
 A total of 300 corporate organisations and nearly 1,500 executives had participated in the first season of the festival. This year, 457 corporate organisations and 4,000 executives took part in the events.
