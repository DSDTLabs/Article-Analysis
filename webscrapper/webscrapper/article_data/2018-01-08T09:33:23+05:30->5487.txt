CHANDIGARH: Outgoing mayor   has announced she would withdraw her candidature for the top post in   as an independent against   nominee Davesh Moudgil, bringing an end to the five-day-long political drama that exposed the divide in the ruling party.

 A day after the BJP high command reprimanded her and issued clear-cut instructions to toe the party line when she and BJP Chandigarh chief met national organising secretary   in Delhi, Jaswal on Sunday morning called a meeting of her supporters at her house in Sector 21. She made the announcement in the evening. Ravi   of the BJP too would withdraw his candidature for the post of senior deputy mayor as an independent. Both will officially withdraw their papers just before the start of the elections on Tuesday.
 
 However, Jaswal termed the move as her victory. “Moudgil has given a written assurance that he will take all of us together and will not indulge in any anti-party activity. Moudgil apologised to me and assured he will work for the betterment of the party.” “Moreover, me and my party president Sanjay   were heard properly before the high command in New Delhi,” she said.
 
 The BJP is divided into two groups — one headed by MP   and the other by Tandon. Jaswal belongs to Tandon group. Moudgil, the party’s mayoral candidate, is backed by Kher.
 
 Before the announcement, Moudgil visited the house of Jaswal and both she and Tandon offered him a “laddo”.
 
 Moudgil said, “Good sense finally prevailed. We all are together and I am deeply thankful to the all party leadership for showing faith in me.”
