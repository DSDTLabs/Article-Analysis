HYDERABAD: A five-month-old boy died due to   at Gandhi Hospital here on Saturday. This is the second incident of an infant succumbing to the virus this season, the first one being in January. 

 The victim, hailing from  , was shifted from   after he contracted swine flu early this week. The baby was already suffering from congenital heart disease and lung problem. “The boy had other health issues. The rest of the babies are stable. We will observe them for one more week as we don’t want to take chances,” said Dr Sravan, superintendent of Gandhi Hospital. 
 
 At present, 13 children below one year are undergoing treatment for swine flu in a special ward at Gandhi Hospital. Five cases were referred by Niloufer Hospital and one by Sunshine Hospital. Niloufer has tested 46 children for flu so far this month, of which six were found positive.
 
 “We have shifted the pulmonology department from   to Gandhi Hospital to provide better treatment,” said Dr M Ramani, director of medical education.
 
 Doctors said the incidence of swine flu in babies is rare. “The HIN1 virus must be taking a new shape,” said Dr Ramesh Reddy, superintendent of Niloufer Hospital. “We have sent blood samples of the babies to Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology and Pune-based National Institute of Virology. We hope to find the reasons for the spurt in swine flu in babies,” he said.
