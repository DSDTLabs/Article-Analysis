RANCHI: Tempers flared again in the ongoing battle between fierce rivals India and Australia with pacer Ishant   and young opener Matt   getting involved in a heated exchange on day five of the third Test.

 Ishant set up Renshaw brilliantly to dismiss the left-handed Aussie opener in the second innings after a heated verbal exchange between the two opponents.
 
 Noticing some activity near the sight-screen, Renshaw had pulled out from the batting crease and a livid Ishant ended up throwing the ball in his follow through.
 
 
 
 
 
  
 The ball landed away from Renshaw but the incident led to some exchanges between Ishant and him. Also jumping in was   and the umpire sought immediate intervention of Indian skipper   to defuse the situation.
 
 Following a couple of minutes delay, Ishant finally resumed his over and charged Renshaw with a short-pitched delivery that hit the youngster's thigh pad and climbed straight up to hit the chin through the gap of the helmet grill.
 
 He followed it up with a bouncer that swung past Renshaw from a middle stump line and the opener looked under pressure.
 
 Finally the big breakthrough moment came in for India when Ishant cramped Renshaw for room with a full length delivery that trapped the left-hander right in front of the stumps.
 
 Ishant enjoyed an animated celebration and capped off the brilliant over with another nasty blow to Shaun Marsh.
