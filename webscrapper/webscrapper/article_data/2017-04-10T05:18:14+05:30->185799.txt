JAIPUR: Muslims have a lower rate of divorce compared to other religious communities, including Hindus, the   ( ) has claimed in response to a petition by RSS-affiliated Muslim body   (MRM) against the practice of triple talaq. The petition claims to have been signed by 10 lakh women.

 AIMPLB made this claim citing a report based on   replies, family courts,   (Shariat courts) and independent studies from 30 districts.
 
 This report was unveiled by AIMPLB’s women’s wing chief Asma Zohra during the inaugural of a two-day workshop on challenges before Muslim women in Jaipur on Saturday.
 
 The central government has challenged the validity of triple talaq in the   stating the practice to be against gender justice and spirit of the Constitution.
 
 AIMPLB, contesting the case in favour of triple talaq, will submit the report in the court to counter the argument that Muslims have highest number of divorce in the country due to the practice of triple talaq.
 
 Citing divorce data collected from a period between 2011 and 2016, Zohra said, “Hindus constitute 56.21% of the total population in Kozhikode, alienate them”.
 
 “Our report demolished the central government's basic premise that Muslims have high rate of divorce. I demand the central government to collect data on divorce cases nationally before attacking the most convenient way of talaq,” said Farooqui, who has served as a legal counsellor for 12 years in a family court.
 
 “If you spent years dissolving a marriage, then chances of rehabilitating become almost difficult. Triple talaq is more secure for women seeking divorce as it involves several rounds of negotiations.
 
 It is in the eye of the storm because it is related to Islam,” said Farooqui, who claimed that Muslims also have least number of separated couples which, she said, is the “worst form of any relationship”.
