  In a letter instructing his subordinate officials, the SSP said policemen hardly wear helmets when they ride motorcycles. “This not only poses a threat to their own lives but also makes a bad impression on the common man. People raise questions on why the common man has to abide by traffic rules but not policemen. In this regard, inspector general of Moradabad range already has issued directions that no policeman should drive a two-wheeler without wearing a helmet,” he added.
