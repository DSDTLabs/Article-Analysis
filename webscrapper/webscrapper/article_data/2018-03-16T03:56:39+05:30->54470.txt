BHOPAL: State   president   has kicked up a controversy by saying in public that politicians do have to oblige criminals at times. The state government was quick to distance itself from his statement, but   has demanded a police case against Chauhan for “harbouring criminals”.

 
 “Even a criminal, after committing a crime, expects favour from his people’s representative. We are also compelled to call up police and say that the person has done such an act but spare him,” the BJP veteran said at the inauguration of a police station building in Nepanagar town of Burhanpur district on Wednesday evening. 
 
 In the same breath, Chauhan added that police work under tremendous pressure. “Most often, police have to work under pressure from society and politicians. Sometimes, pressure on police from different quarters of society helps check crime,” Chauhan said, but did not explain how.
 
  home minister   did not support Chauhan’s statement. “Police do not work under any political pressure,” he said on Thursday. “I am not aware of the BJP chief ’s remark but I would like to clarify that police in Madhya Pradesh do not work under any kind of pressure. 
 
 Also, politicians and public representatives should desist from helping criminals,” said Thakur in the assembly onThursday. Congress mounted a scathing attack on BJP, and demanded a police case against the Chauhan for his “disclosure”.
