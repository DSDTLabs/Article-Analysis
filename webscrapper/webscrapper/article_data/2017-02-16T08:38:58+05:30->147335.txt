KOCHI: The   Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) has developed an anti-obesity nutraceutical from seaweeds.
The product named   extract is said to be a natural remedy for obesity and dyslipidemia.
 
 The product will be released by   during the inaugural function of the platinum jubilee celebration of CMFRI on Saturday in Kochi.
 
 Kajal Chakraborty, senior scientist in   of CMFRI, who developed the product said, "The extract can be administered to regulate clinical indicators leading to dyslipidemia or obesity, total adipose tissue and visceral fat, triglycerides, cholesterol, both good and bad, known as HDL and LDL. The product contains 100% natural marine bioactive ingredients from selected seaweeds by a patented technology, and would be made available in 400 mg capsules." "The nutraceutical does not have any sideeffects as established by preclinical trials," he added.
 
 Dr P Vijayagopal, head, marine biotechnology division said active ingredients in the product would be packed in plant-based capsules to meet the dietary needs of the large vegetarian population.
 
 CMFRI director A Gopalakrishnan said that the institute is in the process of developing more health products from the underutilized seaweeds.
 "The CMFRI is in the process of standardizing and promoting seaweed farming as a livelihood option for the coastal communities. This is expected to compensate for the dip in income for the fishermen during lean seasons," Dr Gopalakrishnan said.
