New Delhi: Learning from Delhi Metro’s bad experience with the   line, where it’s engaged in a long legal battle, the government has decided to come up with a robust disputes   mechanism to push private investment in mass transit projects.

 Sources in the urban development ministry said this will be one of the major features of the New Metro  . “More projects will be rolled out on public-private-partnership (PPP) mode. Innovating financing is required for capital intensive projects, so we need a mechanism for faster resolution of contractual disputes,” said a ministry official.
 
 Officials said the policy will factor in benefits, such as employment generation, economic gains through reduction in road crashes and pollution while appraising the   rail projects. While Metro projects have a life of over 100 years, the present methods of appraisal take into consideration 30-40 years for assessing net present value.
 
 It is learnt that new norms of financial internal rate of return (FIRR) will also be introduced for approving Metro rail projects. FIRR is largely based on costs and returns of a project. At present, Metro projects are cleared if they have a FIRR of 8%. The ministry may introduce FIRR of 14% as the benchmark for approving new Metro projects.
