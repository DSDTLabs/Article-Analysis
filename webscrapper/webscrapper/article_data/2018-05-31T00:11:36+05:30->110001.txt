Jaipur: The number of e-way bills generated crossed one lakh mark in Rajasthan on Tuesday for the first time, contributed majorly by the intra-state transportation of goods. Rajasthan had implemented intra-state e-way bill on May 20 following the nationwide introduction of inter-state e-way Bill on April 1, 2018.

 Alok Gupta, secretary, commercial taxes, said that out of the total 1.02 lakh bills, intra-state contributed 56,000, while the rest came from inter state."
 
 On the ease of traders and transporters using the system, he said, "Now, the system is operating smoothly as the number of clarifications sought by the dealers and transporters has come down significantly." However, the industry in the state feels that the rules need to be relaxed for goods moving within the municipalities. "We now have to generate bills even to move goods within the Municipal limits. Mentioning HSN code for every item in the containers is very time consuming. We have met the commissioner of commercial taxes on Wednesday for relaxing the norms for goods transported within a municipal," said Suresh Agarwal, president, Federation of Rajasthan Trade and Industry.
