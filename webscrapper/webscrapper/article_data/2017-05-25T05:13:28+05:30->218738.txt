MUMBAI: The state government is considering handing over the right to collect   tax, entertainment duty and non-agricultural tax to municipal corporations once GST is rolled out. 

 An official said revenue from these tax sources will aid civic bodies, including the  , helping them bridge the revenue gap as they will lose octroi and local body tax to GST.
 
 The state government will compensate the municipal corporations for the loss, but by handing over the collection of some taxes to the civic bodies, the direct compensation amounts, in a way, will be brought down. "It will not only help them earn revenue, but also the collection of such taxes, rather local in nature, will be done much more effectively," said a government official. "It is also in keeping with our 'ease of business' principle."
 
 A senior official from the state finance department said the government earns Rs 4,000 crore every year from professional tax, entertainment duty and non-agricultural tax-which is a small fraction of the state's total annual revenue. For this reason, the official said, the government doesn't make enough efforts to properly collect these taxes. "But local bodies, given their much smaller   compared with the state, will take this work seriously," he said. Mumbai's share alone is about 50% of the Rs 4,000 crore the state collects under the three tax heads.
