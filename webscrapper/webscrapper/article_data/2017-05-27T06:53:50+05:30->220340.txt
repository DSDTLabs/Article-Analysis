CHENNAI: For motorists on Anna Salai, it will no more be a bumpy ride near  . The stretch leading to the flyover, covered with metal sheets after a part of it caved in more than a month ago, has been repaired. The sheets have been removed and the road relaid, allowing for smooth traffic flow.

  (CMRL) has laid metal sheets on the opposite side of the road as a precautionary measure.
 
 “We have placed metal sheets on the opposite lane near Anna Flyover, as a boring machine is excavating soil underneath that location to build tunnels. It is only a precautionary measure to prevent a cave-in,“ a CMRL official said.
 
 On April 9, 50 passengers onboard an MTC bus had a narrow escape after the vehicle fell into the crater. A man driving a car that also fell was not injured. The accident took place a few metres from Anna Flyover and the high-security US consulate. CMRL used 130 tonnes of concrete mix to fill the sinkhole and areas near the crater. Before that, the crater had a cover of thick metal sheets welded together with iron rods. Though the heavy sheets were safe for vehicles to travel on, iron rods protruding in some spots posed a risk to motorists.
 
 Similar metal sheets were placed in   near   and   where roads gave in during metro rail construction. CMRL has also repaired those stretches.
