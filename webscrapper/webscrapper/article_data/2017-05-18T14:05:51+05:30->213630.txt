REWARI: Joy lit up the faces of the schoolgirls of Gothra Tappa Dahina village in  , many of whom had been on hunger strike, after the state administration agreed to upgrade their school from Class X to Class XII.

 Nearly 90 students of the village, in Rohtak’s   tehsil, had been agitating since May 10 for their government school to be upgraded to the senior secondary level. About 13 of them had begun an indefinite hunger strike to draw the attention of the authorities. The hunger strike ended on Wednesday. On Wednesday, village sarpanch Suresh Chauhan was handed a notification by the district administration.
 
 “We are very happy that the girls were successful in convincing the authorities. They can now study (till Class 12) in the village and won’t have to travel outside,” he said.
 
 The state government also deputed a school principal on Wednesday. The admission process will commence from Thursday. Earlier, the girls had to travel 3 km to a senior secondary school in a nearby village and faced harassment and molestation along the way. “We faced a lot of problems earlier. They teased us and made it tough to go to school. But now we hope this will change,” one Class X student said. Of the girls who were on hunger strike, many fainted and had to be given medical treatment.
