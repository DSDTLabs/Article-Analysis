THANE: The third   for first-year junior   ( ) was announced on Friday, a day ahead of its schedule, giving applicants an extra day to complete the admission process and claim their seats before round four. 

 As compared to the second list, this one saw a marginal drop of around three per cent for science and commerce, whereas for the arts stream the cut off dipped drastically, specially in Joshi-Bedekar College which showed a drop of 10 per cent. This probably indicated that the city’s high scorers maybe applying to more popular colleges of Mumbai that are offering courses in arts. While, that may be true as far the field of arts is concerned, students applying to science junior colleges are happy with the marginal dip in cut offs. Some teachers and principals predict that a fourth round might not be needed at all. 
 
 Principal of B N Bandodkar College of Science, Madhuri Pejaver, said, “For the past three-four years, we have always been getting cut off percentages in the range of 90. This time too, we are happy with the quality of students coming in. The seats are getting filled up quickly. Right from the first list till the third list, the cut off has slightly reduced by two per cent for our college.” 
 
 Since the cut off refused to drop despite three rounds, average scorers and aspiring science students were left a bit disappointed. “I didn’t get the college of my choice even after scoring 85 per cent in class X. I have now decided to claim a seat in the college I got in the   because even if I choose to wait further for the consecutive rounds, looking at the number of vacant seats left now, I don’t want to get stuck. 
 
 Students have been given deadline till Tuesday to complete their admission process and claim their seats after which the fourth merit list will be announced on August 6 at 5pm.
