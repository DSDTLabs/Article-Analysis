 “During this week, I, with the help of my leader, Vijai Sardesai, will go to Delhi and meet external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and the Prime Minister’s office along with additional solicitor general   and will see how legally Ryan’s case can be put up for his release,”   minister and Siolim MLA Vinod Palyekar said.
 
 Opposition leader Chandrakant Kavlekar, Tivim MLA Nilkant Halarnkar and former Union law minister   were also present and offered to help.
