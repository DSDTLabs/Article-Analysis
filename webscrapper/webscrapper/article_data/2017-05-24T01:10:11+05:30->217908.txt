Coimbatore: Industry associations are trying to organise training workshops, seminars and set up helpdesks to equip small industries to comply with the  . 

 The Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry plans to organise two workshops in June to help small industrialists and traders. President of ICCI Vanitha Mohan said, “We have organised one seminar on June 15 where the senior officials of the tax departments will take part. And, on June 20, we will have a seminar for industries that are exempted from GST.” 
 
 While there is no indication of the number of people that the ICCI plans to reach out to through the seminars, Vanitha Mohan said the target audience is small traders and industrialists. “They do not enjoy the privilege of hiring a consultant to help them with the procedure. So we expect to get as many traders and small industrialists to take part in this seminar,” said Vanitha Mohan. 
 
 The Coimbatore District Small Scale Industries Association (Codissia) has been organising monthly workshops with the help of private consultants and the officials of the tax departments. “We have reached out to most of our members through these workshops. We will continue to organise one or two more workshops,” said president of the association V Sundaram. “We have also been getting some petitions where the industrialists seek help at specific fronts, and we plan to address these queries in the coming workshops,” he added. 
 
 Industrialists also want the tax departments to set up helpdesks in each tax circle of Coimbatore. “There are 18 circles in the city. Under the leadership of the circle inspector, the tax department can set up a helpdesk once in a week or a month to clarify our doubts,” said Maniraj.
