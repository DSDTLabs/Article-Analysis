Nagpur: Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will unveil the statue of Maratha warrior king Shivaji in Shivaji Nagar Garden on Sunday at 11am. Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari will be the chief guest. This was announced by corporator Sanjay Bangale in a press conference.

 The general body of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) had cleared the proposal about ten years ago when Manjusha Bangale was the corporator of Shivaji Nagar area. After Bangale could not contest due to ward reservation, the project went into cold storage. Manjushaâ€™s husband Sanjay was elected in February 2017 and has revived the project.
 
 The total cost of the project is over Rs9 lakh. The fibre glass statue of Shivaji has cost the NMC Rs3.59 lakh while the 2.4 metre diameter pedestal has cost Rs5.63 lakh. Bangale told the media persons that the statue will be enclosed by a wall to prevent its vandalization.
