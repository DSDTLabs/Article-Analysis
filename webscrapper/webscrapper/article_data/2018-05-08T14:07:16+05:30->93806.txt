JAMSHEDPUR: Schoolchildren along with their parents on Monday morning organised a "protest class" on the Dumaria-Gurabhanda road, voicing their opposition to the state government's decision to merge their primary school with another located in Dumaria. The protesters finally abandoned the blockade at 8am after police intervened. 

 During the protest which started at 7am, the children and their parents raised slogans and held placards to oppose the decision of the HRD to shut down the Swargchira upgraded school and merge it with Dumaria primary school. Two para teachers,   and  , who were running the upgraded school, said they have 72 students.
 
 Interestingly, the protest also saw the children studying their textbooks, reciting poems and taking up other class work. 
 
 "The children and their parents called off the agitation when they were told that blockade of vehicles will not resolve their problem," said ASI Anil Tigga of Dumaria police station. 
 
 The district is witnessing a growing opposition to the state education department's move to merge schools across all 24 districts that have either low enrolment or lacks basic facilities like toilets, drinking water, libraries and dilapidated buildings.
 
 "In the last 15 days, reports of protest and agitations related to the merger of schools have abruptly increased and we are regularly communicating the developments to the officials concerned," an education department official said.
 
 The East Singhbhum district is facing closure of nearly 400 government schools in the current academic year.
