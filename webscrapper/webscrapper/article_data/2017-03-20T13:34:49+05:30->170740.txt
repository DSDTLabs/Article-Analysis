A record 4,100 Sikh gurdwaras, institu tions, schools and communities all across India and the world celebrated Sikh Environment Day on March 14 this year, more than any other year since the celebration began in 2010.

 The concept of “Oxygen Langar“ ­ environment conservation -was explained and fulfilled in many countries where celebrations took place.
 
 The celebrations has been championed by   DC-based EcoSikh and supported by prominent Sikh figures, gurdwaras and community members, as well as the  , the Alliance of Religions and Conservation (ARC), the Government of Norway and others, with the main focus always being for people to make real changes that will have an impact for the rest of the year.
 
 Dr Rajwant Singh, Global President of EcoSikh in Washington, said, “March 14 was chosen because it is the Gurgaddi Diwas (Enthronement Day) of the seventh Sikh Guru, Guru Har Rai, the “green Guru“ remembered for his love of nature and care for animals. He is perhaps the first environmentalist in the South Asian region who, during his ministry from 1644 to 1661, started and promoted herbal gardens and wild life refuge. In 2015, Jathedars of all the five Takhts of the Sikhs jointly endorsed this day, recogniz ing Sikh Environment Day as a fixed date on the official Sikh calendar.“
 
 He added, “This is the largest global mass action on environment by a faith community EcoSikh India president Supreet Kaur said, “We saw plantation drives, bicycle rallies, nature walks, special seminars on nature, workshops on kitchen gardening.Many gurdwaras served organic food and there was a huge increase in the number of places where instead of giving sweets, gurdwaras gave plants and seedling or “buta prasad,“ EcoSikh   project manager,   said: “We are thrilled by the overwhelming response by the Sikhs who have reestablished the culture of planting trees as sewa (voluntary service) We salute the Sikhs and the institutions in Derby (UK), Melbourne (Australia), Nairobi (Kenya), China and all over India who planted trees in the forests and in the country area for Sikh Environment Day.“
