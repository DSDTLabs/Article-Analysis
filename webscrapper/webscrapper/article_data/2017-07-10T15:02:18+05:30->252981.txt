   Season 8 is one of the most awaited reality shows of the year and with celebrities like  ,  ,  , Lopamudra Raut and many more popular faces being a part of it, the show has become even more special.
 
  The teaser of the show, in a form of song, has been released and we are excited to see the stars performing deadly stunts in Spain.
  
  Until now we have seen them share their holiday pics from Spain, but the hard work will be seen on our TV screens from Julyy 22 onwards.
  
  
 
  
  Ravi Dubey shared the link of the KKK 8 teaser on Twitter and wrote, "Here's the #kkk8 #musicvideo #watch #enjoy #share."
  
  
  
  The celebs have lip synced on the song and the lyrics of the song are catchy.
  
  While Nia Sharma, Hina Khan and Geeta Phogat look no less than dare devils, Lopamudra and Shibani Dandekar raise the oomph factor.
  
  The men are all geared up for the dangerous stunts and we also catch glimpses of the contestants perform stunts on cars, bikes and animals. As much as we like the song, we were on the edge of the seat by the time the song ended.
  
  The actors have already shot for the show and have returned to India. The show will start airing from July 22.
