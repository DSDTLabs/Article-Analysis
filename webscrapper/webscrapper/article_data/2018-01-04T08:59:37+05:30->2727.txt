BENGALURU: Now that conventional methods have failed to solve the city’s garbage problems, the government has hit on a new plan. Technology, inevitably, is at the root. Officials say the urban development department has given the   (BBMP) the nod to instal ‘smart bins’ across the city. The civic agency also plans automated transfer stations across the city.

 How do smart bins work? Once the bin is full, sensors located in the bin send out a signal. It means the bin needs to be emptied. The information is relayed to contractors, who clear the waste, thus preventing garbage from overflowing. In a pilot project, the BBMP had introduced these smart bins at the   and  .
 
 “The pilot project was a success and we are trying to expand the scheme to the entire of the city. It has proved to be quite effective,” claimed Manjunath Prasad, the BBMP commissioner .
 
 At the other end, another technology of transfer stations has also been tendered by the Palike. As many as 50 locations in Bengaluru will have these transfer stations. The basic idea of a transfer station is to clear waste systematically and avoid garbage piling up overnight.
 
 “These transfer stations will have a compressor,” Prasad said. “All the garbage collected by our pourakarmikas and contractors will be brought to the site and filled into the compressor. The compressor will drain out the liquid, which will flow into the drainage system. This will reduce the weight of the garbage and kill the odour. It will then be transported to our compost units.”
 
 The government and the Palike are hoping to instal these stations at locations which are notorious for their piles of waste. The state government and BBMP is both hoping that use of these modern technologies, which they say has proven to be a success in other cities across the country and abroad, will help rid the city of the garbage problem.
