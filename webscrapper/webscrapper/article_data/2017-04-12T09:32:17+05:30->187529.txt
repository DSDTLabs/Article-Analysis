GUWAHATI: As the state prepares for  , Priyanka Das, an Assamese woman scientist from the  , who had developed a 'pitha' stand last year to give uniform shape and size to pitha, is still waiting for entrepreneurs to take her creation to the people. 

 The Assamese snack pitha is the icing of Bihu festivities but to prepare it is a laborious task. For one, getting a uniform shape is difficult and second, there are chances of getting your fingers burnt while preparing it on a hot 'tawa' (pan).
 
  What unique about Das's creation is that it assures uniform shape and size and saves fuel because it takes lesser time to get done. She had developed two multi-deck stands with oval and round shapes. The two stands are attached with detachable handles and are suitable for cylindrical and half-moon shaped pitha.
 
 Though she has been able to sell close to 19 units of her production so far in Jorhat, she is till eyeing for a viable market in the city. When she ventured into production, Das found that the stand had to be made manually. For production of one unit of pitha stand, she had to shell out Rs 200. She then found there was no   in   to make the moulds on the aluminium plates. She had to get someone to manually do the moulds. 
 
 "If I make the moulds outside Assam, it would cost me double the price. We don't have the infrastructure here. It is sad that we still have a long way to go. I want to venture into a lucrative market like Guwahati but it requires campaigning and help from entrepreneurs," said Das.
 
 Last year, she was able to display her creation at a farmers' fair where she got a good response. But for large-scale production, she needs commercial viability. "The production takes time. I had approached the industry department. The response was positive. It helped during the manual production of the stand. But more needs to be done and I hope the infrastructure in Assam improves," added Das.
