Vadodara: A day ahead of their final exams, students of MS University's Faculty of Science kept running between the university head office and faculty to get their hall tickets corrected. 

 Exams of Faculty of Science are scheduled to begin from Thursday. But when students started printing their hall tickets, they realised that the hall tickets were goofed up. The admit cards did not mention the foundation and elective subjects and in may cases the subjects mentioned were incorrect. 
 
 When the students approached the university’s exam section, they were asked to get the signatures of the head, dean and co-ordinator on the applications for rectifying the hall tickets. This resulted in chaos as the students were spending more time in rectifying the mistakes than preparing for exams. 
 
 Professor A C Sharma, dean of Faculty of Science, admitted that the hall tickets issued for the second semester students of first year bachelors of science carried mistakes of the subjects. 
 
 “We are not sure about the exact reason but the mistakes could have happened due to the Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Limited (MKCL) system that manages the student life cycle. The subjects allocated to the students are entered into the student’s profile,” he said. 
 
 “But nonetheless, we are preparing a list of all such students who are facing such problems and coordinating with the exam section so that the students do not face any further problems,” he said. 
 
 Sharma said that such mistakes in hall tickets issued to first semester students had not surfaced. 
 
 Sharma also sent a letter to university’s deputy registrar (exam) asking the latter to probe into the matter and requesting the university authorities to get the issue rectified. 
 
 In last three days, around 30 students have brought the anomalies in the hall tickets to the notice of the faculty, the letter states, adding that it has resulted into stress for the students.
