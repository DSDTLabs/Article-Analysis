NOIDA: Hundreds of commuters were stuck in traffic snarls on   Flyway and Shahdara bridge on the Mahamaya-Kalindi Kunj route during peak hours on Tuesday, owing to massive jams after the temporary ban on entry of trucks and other heavy vehicles into the national capital from Noida side.

 Traffic moved at snail’s pace on DND Flyway and Shahdara bridge from as early as 8 am till 12.30pm as over 200 trucks remained stranded on the high-speed corridor and at Kalindi Kunj border.
 
 
 
 
 These trucks which had arrived from Madhya Pradesh, Agra, Lucknow, Haryana, Punjab and other states were parked on five lanes of the DND Flyway going towards Delhi, giving commuters travelling from Noida to Delhi a tough time as they battled to join the single lane that was only available for them to move towards the national capital.
 
 On the Mahamaya-Kalindi Kunj route, traffic moved at snail’s pace as many heavy vehicles were stranded there too with the route being choc-o-block during morning peak hours between 8.30 am and 10 am. The snarls extended till the start of the Mahamaya Flyover.
 
 The situation eased only after the   police allowed entry of heavy vehicles into the national capital around 12.30 pm.
 
 Officers of Delhi traffic police said most of the transporters were well-informed in advance as the force issues circulars to them about the   rehearsals every year.
 
 “We have made around 1,000 heavy vehicles return from the DND to take a U-turn. Since, these are heavy vehicles, they take a lot of time to retreat. We usually issue notices to the transporters but they do not inform their drivers,” Delhi Police’s head constable Amit Kumar said.
