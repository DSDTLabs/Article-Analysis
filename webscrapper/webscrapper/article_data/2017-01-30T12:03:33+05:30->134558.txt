PANAJI: Pointing out that the BJP had repeated the promises made in 2012 in its manifesto released on Sunday, Goa   said that the 2017 manifesto was only an   and that the “document could not be taken seriously.”

 “The manifesto is contrary to the 2012 manifesto with no economics or clarity on anything. It’s a vague document,” chief spokesperson   said.
 
 Congress objected to the BJP’s move to include the Adil Shah Palace, Fatorda Stadium and other infrastructure works in the  . “Did the BJP build the Adil Shah Palace? And, just because they changed a few bulbs at the stadium can the BJP take credit for something that was built even before the party came to power?” Kawthankar questioned.
 
 He also questioned the BJP on its silence on other issues such as continuation of grants to English medium schools, removal of casinos, and guaranteed employment for Goan youth. “The absence of a stand or a mention of casinos in the manifesto is proof that the BJP has been bought by the casino lobby,” Kawthankar said.
