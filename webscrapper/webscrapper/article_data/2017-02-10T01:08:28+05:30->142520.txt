MUMBAI: The   on Thursday dismissed a petition by   seeking setting up of a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the death of her daughter, Bollywood actor  . Rabia had opposed the CBI’s conclusion that Jiah had committed suicide. 

 Actor   was booked for abetting Jiah’s suicide in 2013. A division bench of Justices Ranjit More and Shalini Phansalkar-Joshi cleared the decks for the trial against Sooraj to resume. 
 
 Rabia, a British citizen, had claimed that her daughter, an American, was murdered and sought the case to be transferred to an SIT or the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the US.
 
 “Merely because CBI, an independent agency, like the state police has arrived at the same conclusion, after its re-investigation or fresh investigation, that of ruling out the possibility of homicidal death and Rabia is not satisfied with the same, it cannot be accepted that one more agency, like SIT, should be again directed to carry out further investigation. Needless to state, that there would be no end to such exercise until the she gets the result of her choice,” said the court. 
 
 The judges said more than three-and-a-half years have lapsed after the incident and “nothing fruitful” will be achieved by directing the SIT to conduct a fresh probe when two agencies have already investigated the case. The HC said Rabia has the option of placing the materials before the trial court. “She can still persuade the trial court for redressal of her grievances on the basis of the material produced on record,” added the court.
 
 Jiah was found hanging from the ceiling of her residence on June 3, 2013 and her boyfriend, Sooraj, was charged with driving her to commit suicide. The HC had transferred the case to the CBI after Rabia approached the court claiming her daughter was murdered. In December 2015, the CBI filed a charge sheet against Sooraj for abetting Jiah’s suicide. Rabia, then moved the HC again alleging the CBI had not looked at crucial evidence.
