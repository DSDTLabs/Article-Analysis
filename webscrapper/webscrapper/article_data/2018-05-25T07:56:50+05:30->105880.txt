CHANDIGARH: Considering the hard times the municipal corporation is going through, newly-joined commissioner   on Thursday nixed all development agenda items brought up during the monthly house meeting. He told the members of the house that till   finds a way to come out of the current financial crunch, no development agenda would be passed. 

 Councillors said the Chandigarh administration should be asked to give grant-in-aid, as recommended by the Third Delhi   Commission, because they were dealing with crucial daily routine works like supply of water, sanitation, electricity, roads and parks’ maintenance. During the discussion, the commissioner told the members that only most urgent works would get approval, and for maintaining the sanctity of the house it was better not to bring on table development agenda items.
 
 “Our Rs 40-crore bills of works completed by the contractors are pending. Besides, there are many works which have been left midway by contractors. Therefore, our first priority is to find a way out of financial crunch,” the commissioner said.
 
 Mayor Davesh Moudgil said within a few days, a special meeting of the general house would be called to discuss the problem and everybody’s suggestion would be taken so that works could resume.
