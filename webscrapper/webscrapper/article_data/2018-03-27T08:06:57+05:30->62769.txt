CHENNAI: It is more than a year since the Centre launched the   card for the differently abled, there are few takers for the all-purpose document. In Tamil Nadu, with nearly 11.8 lakh People with Diabilities (PwD) as per the 2011 Census, only 1,2791 cards have been issued. 

 The UDID, an 18-digit number, can provide PwD seamless access to benefits and schemes, but members of the community say they have not been adequately sensitised about the process or about the benefits.
 
 Also called Svalamban Card, it was to replace the multiple documents that PwD used earlier. "Except reports and announcements that the card will help us avail benefits, no camps have been organized to show what the card is about, or how to submit the documents online. Except for a few in urban areas, remaining are not even aware of the cards," said P Saravanan, of the December 3 movement.
 
 Others said the government should organise camps to educate people about the scheme and help them with the online process. "Forms can be submitted online but a number of documents are needed and have to be submitted in two languages, including English. If forms are to be submitted physically, it can be done only at the   (DDRC) which is physical impossible to access for such a huge population," said Tamil Nadu Differently-Abled Federation Charitable Trust president Simma Chandran.
 
 Many who managed to register online have only got the e-version. "I have still to get the physical card," said B Varada, who applied in October 2016.
