VADODARA: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC)   witnessed a   issue of the   idols in the city being curtailed. While the discussion began regarding idol issue, corporators ended up trading charges about  

 The issue of idols was raised by opposition leader Chandrakant Shrivastava who pointed out that several Ganpati organisers did not want to make ‘pandals’ this year. “The festival fervour is being killed because of such dictats,” he said. 
 
 Mayor Bharat Dangar intervened by saying that the issue was not something that VMC could handle. He added that there were court judgements that had given directives. But chaos prevailed soon when Shrivastava mentioned that the ruling party (BJP) was elected chanting the name of God.
 
 Shrivastava’s comments did not go down well with the BJP corporators who without naming any faith said that even Congress members had got elected taking someone’s name. BJP’s Jivraj Chauhan even alleged that some Congress members were supporting ‘triple talaaq’.
