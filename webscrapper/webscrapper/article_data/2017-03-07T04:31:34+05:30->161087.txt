NEW DELHI: The   sought explanation on Monday from the   government on its decision to remove T P   as DGP who called it an “arbitrary” decision and said that the chief minister should then be held accountable for the political murders in the state.

 The Kerala government’s decision to remove Senkumar came soon after it came to power in May last year as it accused him of “poor handling” of two cases — the Puttingal Temple fire tragedy and rape and murder of a 29-year-old Dalit woman in Perumbavoor in Ernakulum in April, 2016.
 
 Appearing before a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta, Senkumar’s counsel and senior advocate Dushyant Dave urged the court to stay the state government’s decision which, he said, smacked of arbitrariness.
 
 “I am being damned without reason. By the same standard, will the chief minister be removed taking responsibility for the political murders?” he asked.
 
 The court agreed with his submission that a top officer cannot be punished for an incident. “We have been reading in papers about crime incidents that take place almost daily. If on the basis of such incidents, you begin to remove DGP of a state, there would be no policemen left in this country to serve at this post,” the bench said.
 
 Senkumar challenged the decision of his removal as a violation of Section 97(2)(e) of Kerala Police Act which assures a two-year tenure to the DGP. He was removed with one of his tenure still left. He alleged that the present political dispensation wanted to remove him as he had investigated some cases involving CPM leaders.
