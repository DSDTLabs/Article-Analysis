BHOPAL: People living close to   (OFI) in   of Madhya Pradesh startled awake early on Friday by an almighty noise.

 There was a explosion in OFI's the automatic acid plant -- located 8 km away from the factory's main gate, at 6.45 am, said sources.
 
 The boom triggered a panic among residents living in 10-12 km away from the factory premises forcing them to run out of their houses.
 
 The blast has reportedly caused some damages to the plant, but there was no casualty.
 
  Anil Sharma said OFI has not asked for any help from the local administration and have not reported any casualties. 
 
 "Initially we have come to know that there was some leakage in the acid plant. Exact cause is being ascertained," said the officer.
 
 OFI officials could not be contacted.
 
 In 2016 five workers were seriously injured in similar blast at OFI. That explosion took place in building No. 812 of the factory.
 
 There was a similar blast at OF, Itarsi in 2013 where three people were seriously injured. The blast took place at the building No FR 1266 when four people were inside the building.
 
 Sources said that there is enormous pressure as the output targets have been raised, which is leading to security lapses.
