IMPHAL:   chief minister   flew to New Delhi on Tuesday to meet the   and finalize the list of candidates for the  . 

 So far, more than 80 aspiring candidates had withdrawn application forms from the party office, a Manipur Congress leader said and added that the last date for submission of forms was January 25. 
 
 The chief minister's only son, Okram Surjakumar, will contest the polls from Thoubal district's Khangabok constituency; the seat is currently represented by Ibobi's wife Landhoni Devi.
 
 The chief minister, who is the chairman of the recently formed election campaign committee, is also expected to join a Congress convention at the national capital, the state Congress leader added.
 
 Though many seats in the state will witness a multi-cornered contest, the election overall will be a direct fight between BJP and Congress. The latter is hoping to retain power for a fourth straight term.
 
 The chief minister, the face of Congress's campaign, has asked party workers to highlight the achievements of the government.
 
 Meanwhile, many political parties strongly feel that United Naga Council (UNC)'s intensified agitation would severely disrupt campaigning for the polls. The UNC-sponsored economic blockade on the state's national highways, which has triggered a commodity crisis in the land-locked state, entered its 70th day on Tuesday.
 
 Volunteers of UNC have been disrupting government functions in the 'Naga areas' of Manipur. On Monday night, miscreants unsuccessfully tried to torch the office of the deputy commissioner of Tamenglong by lobbing petrol bombs at the building.
 
 The Janata Dal (United), Aam Aadmi Party, Janata Dal (Secular) and Manipur Democratic People's Front have already urged the state government and the Centre to resolve the UNC agitation at the earliest to ensure free and fair polls, particularly in the hill districts of Manipur.
