KOCHI: A two-day film festival to commemorate G Aravindan, one of the pioneers of parallel cinema in Malayalam, was inaugurated here on Saturday. The ‘G Aravindan Retrospective’ to mark the 26th death anniversary of the illustrious director will screen nine of his movies. 

 Kochi mayor Soumini Jain inaugurated the event at Children’s Park Theatre. Highlighting the role played by cultural centres in promoting movies with artistic content otherwise shunned by entertainment channels, she said the corporation has plans to construct such centres in different parts of the city.
 
 “Kochi is not just a commercial city anymore. It has marked itself on the global map as a cultural city as well, especially with the coming of Biennale. The onus to nurture the title is upon us and I’ll try to deliver a cultural centre with theatre at the PJ Antony ground at Vaduthala before my tenure ends. A centre at Parvanamukku at Fort Kochi is also under consideration,” Jain said.
 
 The films on day one were screened before a packed audience at Children’s Park Theatre. Actor   who debuted through Aravindan’s movie ‘Maaraattam’ was the guest.
 
 Reminiscing her experience on working with the director, she said: “He had a unique and unorthodox way of filming. I was selected on the basis of my proficiency in Mohiniyattam, but when the shooting began, I was asked to dance to a tune completely out of the sphere of Mohiniyattam. It was surprising, but it was how the movie was envisioned by him,” Urmila said.
 
 The festival, organized by the   and   along with  , will see the screening of ‘Thampu’, ‘Kanchana Sita’, ‘Chidambaram’ and ‘Esthappan’ from 10am on Sunday.
