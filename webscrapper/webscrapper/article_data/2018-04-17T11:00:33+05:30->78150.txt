JAIPUR:   on Monday opened a front against the state government over fees hike by private schools. Party's Jaipur district president   entered the education department office with 100 supporters demanding resignation of education minister Vasudev Devnani for not being able to regulate school fees. 

 Raising slogans against chief minister Vasundhara Raje and Devnani, Khachariyawas said, "Every day parents are protesting against the unjust hike of fees up to 30% by the schools but government is yet to react on the issue. They are acting in favour of private schools which will cost them dearly. The issue is serious and will become a big movement in the city."
 
 Congress has also announced to start a new campaign 'Fees Ghatao, Bachpan Bachao' in all 91 wards on April 18. "If schools will not roll back the fees in the next 24 hours,   will start door-to-door campaign in all 91 wards seeking support of parents and students," said Khachariyawas. Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma blamed   government for scrapping the state-level fees committee formed during the Gehlot government in 2013. "They replaced the fees committee by a new Rajasthan Private Fees Act which has a weird provision of 10-member committee including five parents, three teachers and a principal and one member from the school management to decide the fees.
 
  Parents were not aware of any such committee whereas Devnani is claiming that 26,000 schools have formed such fees fixation committees which indicates gross corruption in deciding the fees," said Khachariyawas.
 
 Pointing out the problem in the act, Khachariyawas said that the act doesn't leave any scope for state to intervene. "It is a deliberate attempt by the state to empower schools and allow them to fleece parents," said Khachariyawas. The tension between the parents and schools is simmering over fees hike. Several schools in the city have hiked fees up to 30% citing that revised pay scales as a reason.
