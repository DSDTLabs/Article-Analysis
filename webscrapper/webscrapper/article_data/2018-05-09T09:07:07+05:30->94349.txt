VARANASI: A team of experts assigned by the Kanchi Kamakoti Peeth will soon start treating the 240-year-old artistic sand stone walls of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple (KVT), which have been decaying for decades due to the ‘cancerous’ effect of enamel paint coatings.

 
  
 
 Rs 5.50 crore has been collected through donations for project and work will begin after a four-day Maha-Kumbhabhishek, to be held between June 19 and 22, by 201 Brahmins under the supervision of Kanchi Peeth Shankaracharya Swami Vijayendra Saraswati.
 
 Incidentally, the KVT administration has been struggling to find a way for the conservation of the temple despite spending about Rs 60 lakh on studies conducted by various agencies.
 
 Chief executive officer of KVT,  , said: “The Kanchi Peeth, which has experience in conserving many ancient temples of south and east India, has taken up the responsibility of conserving, restoring and renovating the KVT walls and its sanctum sanctorum.”
 
 “Various companies which have technical expertise in this field and have already worked with Kanchi Peeth will handle the project. The cost of the project, which has been estimated at Rs 5.50 crores, is being arranged through donations. The temple or the state government will not have to bear this cost. The temple administration will monitor the work for quality control,” he added.
