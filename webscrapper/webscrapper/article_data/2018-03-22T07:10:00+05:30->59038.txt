 Ludhiana: Giving yet another chance to tax payers, the local bodies department has extended the deadline for payment of property and house tax with 10% rebate up to March 31. This announcement has left the municipal corporation in a bind as it is yet to receive the notification. 
 
 Till now, the MC — which is yet to recover property tax from more than 95,000 defaulters — was charging 10% penalty. 
 
 MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh said, “We have not received the notification till now. As residents are seeking rebate, we have asked the senior officials to provide the notification as soon as possible.” 
 
 Worried over meeting the targets, officials want MC to lower the collection targets. “The rebate might have a bearing on the collection. We have written to the local bodies department to reduce property tax collection target from Rs 100 crore to Rs 70 crore, as we have already recovered around Rs 62 crore.” 
 
 The 10% rebate scheme was earlier launched in October 2017 and defaulters were given time till January 15. After the deadline, the department started charging 10% penalty from the tax payers and recovered over Rs 4 crore. 
 
 4 superintendents get notice 
 
 MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh has issued a show-cause notice to four superintendents for slow recovery of water supply and sewerage dues. With a few days left for the financial year to end, the fee recovery had not picked up pace. Against the target of Rs 100 crore, the department recovered only Rs 30 crore so far.
