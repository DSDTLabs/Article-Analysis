CHENNAI: Acceding to   advocate-general  's submission that courts could not order notice to state governor and asembly speaker, the Madras high court has deleted their names in a petition to quash appointment of   as assembly secretary. 

 Justice T  , however, directed the Vijay Narayan to get instructions as to against whom or which authority the court can issue a direction, in case if the petitions are allowed and posted the plea to March 21. 
 
 The issue pertains to the plea to quash the appointing   as secretary to the assembly, by allegedly passing the seniority list. Senior counsel P   submitted that the governor could enjoy the constitutional immunity only when his actions were based on the advice of council of ministers. In the present case, he made the appointment through the powers conferred under Assembly rules, which would not give him any protection from judicial review, Wilson added.
