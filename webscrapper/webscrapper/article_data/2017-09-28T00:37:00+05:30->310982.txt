Udhagamandalam:   state secretray, G Ramakrishnan, has written to the   of Tamil Nadu police, seeking him to take action against police personnel who allegedly mishandled students in Erumadu for trying to hoist a flag in a function held on August 22.

 According to the letter, sub-inspector Nicholas and special sub-inspector Sasidharan, who were attached to Erumadhu police station, had threated the students belonging to the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) saying that false cases would be lodged against them when they were hoisting the union flag near Deval here.
 
 “The two police personnel should be inquired and a case should be lodged against them,” said the letter. It also said the police officers had abused the students verbally with unparliamentary words.
 
 However, Sakthivel, Devala DSP, told TOI, “The issue has been politicized. The students’ wing belonging to the communist party was asked to remove a flag pole because theu erected the pole at a tri-junction in front of a government middle school in Erumadu.” He further said, “And no permission was given either by the local body or the National Highways department to erect the pole.”
 
 “Students from a government arts college located close to the government middle school tried to motivate the school children to join the communist students’ wing. Even applications were distributed to the school children, which we objected,” said Sakthivel.
 
 “In the public meeting held at Erumadu, CPM cadres abused the two police sub-inspectors using vulgar words. And for which we have lodged a complaint against the cadres though they were not arrested,” the DSP said.
