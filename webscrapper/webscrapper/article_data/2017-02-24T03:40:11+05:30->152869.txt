NEW DELHI: Late on Wednesday, kTariq Ahmed   walked out of   after being imprisoned for 11 years in the Delhi blasts case. Dar, then a district manager with Johnson & Johnson, was convicted for being a member of a terrorist organisation — a tag he wants to shed desperately.

 He hopes to see his daughter, who was born while he was jailed, and spend time with his family, who he says has suffered equally. “It has been 12 years since my arrest in Delhi, but I still do not know where   is,” he said.
 
 Though absolved of the stringent charges of waging war against the country, conspiracy and murder, Dar was convicted for being a member of a terror group and supporting it. “It is unfortunate as the charges were not present in the FIR. I will go to the high court and clear my name,” he said.
