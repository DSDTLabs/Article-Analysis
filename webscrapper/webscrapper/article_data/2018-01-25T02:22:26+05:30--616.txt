NEW DELHI: Three days after the online portal for admissions to   opened to public, parents have complained that they are still having trouble completing and submitting the form. While some parents complained that opening the portal itself was difficult through the day, the others said that directions on the portal were misleading and constantly changing. However, government officials said it could be a temporary  , though the number of applications received till date are over 10,000.

 According to a parent, while filling up the distance area sections of the  , the neighbourhood choices kept fluctuating, sometimes giving three school options, sometimes two. Parents also complained that opening the form itself was taking a very long time, while there was an error after submitting the form.
 
 Rajiv Kumar of NGO Pardarshita, who helps parents with the filling of   forms, said that while over the last two days about 20 forms were submitted, but on Wednesday, the servers were either slow or unresponsive. “We had a tough time submitting forms. We could barely submit four forms today on our four systems,” he said.
 
 Parents also complained that the instructions on the portal were misleading. They said that while filling the form, while the portal informs the applicant that the details need not be filled if the parent doesn’t want to send the child beyond 6kms, the final submission does not take place until the above 6km tab is completed.
 
 While Kumar believed that the issues were there because of the constant updating of data on the portal, director of education clarified that updates have been completed. “We have been receiving unprecedented response. It (the issues) could be because of traffic,” said Saumya Gupta, director of education.
 
 Government officials too said that the issue might have been caused by temporary server problems.
