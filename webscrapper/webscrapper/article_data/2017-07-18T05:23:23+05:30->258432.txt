MUMBAI: The police on Monday provided filmmaker   non-categorized security in view of Congress workers protesting against his movie,  , which is scheduled to release on July 28.

 Rashmi Karandikar, city police's spokesperson, said, “Bhandarkar has been given non-categorised police protection.“ Two armed constables have been deployed to take care of Bhandarkar's security during the day while two others will protect him at night.
 
 Only a few people in Maharashtra have categorised security--Z plus, Z, Y plus, Y and so on.
 
 Indu Sarkar is based on the Emergency period and the   (CBFC) has suggested 12 cuts in the film. Some Congress workers have demanded that the movie be first shown to them so that they could make sure that Indira and Sanjay Gandhi have not been portrayed in poor light. Following the protests, Bhandarkar had cancelled his movie's promotional events in the city and Nagpur. The Congress has distanced itself from the protests.
 
 The special branch of the city police, which deals in collecting intelligence, is also keeping a tab on the activities of some political workers and is exchanging information with the city police.
