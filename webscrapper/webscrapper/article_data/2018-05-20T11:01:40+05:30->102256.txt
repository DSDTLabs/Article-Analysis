CHANDIGARH: Stating Saturday’s development inside the Karnataka Vidhan Sabha had proved that the BJP had stooped to new lows of political impropriety to grab power by any means, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has demanded immediate resignation of Karnataka governor Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala on ethical grounds.

 “Vala, an RSS functionary who was clearly working at the behest of the BJP leadership, had lost all moral right to continue in office,” said Amarinder. He added that the governor’s august office has been maligned and denigrated by Vala and if he failed to resign, the Supreme Court should order his dismissal. The Punjab chief minister, however, hailed Saturday’s developments in Karnataka assembly as a vindication of the Congress party’s moral and political stand. He described it as a total loss of face for the BJP.
 
 “The events of the day had thoroughly exposed the dirty nexus between the party and the Karnataka governor, who had violated all norms of Constitutional decorum and democratic principles to sub-serve the interests of his political masters”, said Amarinder.
 
 On B S Yeddyurappa’s resignation ahead of the crucial floor test in the assembly, Amarinder said the Indian democracy had been saved from total desecration at the hands of the power-hungry BJP. He also hailed Supreme Court’s endeavour to uphold the constitution. The chief minister also commended Karnataka Congress leaders and MLAs for their refusal to succumb to the reported BJP pressure and temptations.
