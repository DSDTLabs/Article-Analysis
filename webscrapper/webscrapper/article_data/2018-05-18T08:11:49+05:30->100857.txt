CHANDIGARH:   vice-chancellor Arun Kumar Grover has appealed to all members of the senate to attend its May 27 meeting to take a call on the quantum of punishment to a public administration teacher found guilty of sexual harassment. The decision requires two-third majority in a house of 93 but the attendance records sent with the appeal aren’t encouraging.

 
  
 
 The records are of the senate meetings from 2012 to 2018. In the senate meeting of April 1, the House had taken a poll to decide the quantum of punishment. Of 50 members present, 18 did not vote for the termination of the teacher’s services. They voted instead for his demotion, while 32 senators were in favour of dismissing the assistant professor with a possibility of future employment. The senate was undecided after four hours and had to adjourn its meeting for want of two-third majority on any side.
 
 “Taking a decision on the agenda item in question may require the presence of two-third of the total members of the senate. So, I appeal to you to go through the agenda papers in advance and consider attending the meeting on May 27,” the VC has written in his appeal letter to the senators. Of four complaints of sexual harassment against the assistant professor, he was proved guilty in two cases. One complaint was withdrawn and he apologised in another case.
 
 The PU calendar suggests three major punishments, including demotion, termination of service with a provision for future employment, and dismissal without any possibility of future hiring. The House had decided that the third option (termination without the possibility of future employment) should not be considered. It had decided to choose between the first and second option, though the vice-chancellor was clearly against giving preference to demotion over dismissal.
