BENGALURU: Kempegowda International Airport ( ) completed 10 years on Thursday. Over the past decade, Bangalore   (BIAL) has introduced various facilities to improve the passenger experience, including KSRTC Flybus, taxi zones, free baby stroller services and heli-taxis.  , managing director and CEO, BIAL, spoke to TOI about the airport expansion plans and challenges lying ahead. 
Excerpts:
 
 
 
 
 From serving 10 million passengers in 2008 to 26.9 million in 2018, we have steadily grown to become the third largest airport in the country. To keep up with such unprecedented growth and at the same time enable a seamless passenger experience is our greatest achievement.
 
 
 
 
 
 Having partnered with Accenture to set up a digital roadmap for the airport, BIAL aims to introduce innovative services and products. Passengers can expect a multimodal transport hub at the airport. The need of the hour is to integrate airport access into city planning to improve the transport system. The second terminal with a garden will blend with the ethos of Bengaluru as a Garden City.
 
 
 
 
 
 T2 is being designed as an integrated terminal to handle both domestic and international passengers. The final allocation of airline slots and traffic will depend on how the scenario evolves.
 
 
 
 
 In any large airport, mass transit connectivity plays a critical role in decongesting the roads. Similarly, as the Bengaluru airport grows, Metro connectivity to the airport will become important. BIAL is currently in discussion with AERA and we will have an update once the discussions conclude.
 
 
 
 
 Our long-term expansion plans include construction of terminal 2 and the advanced New South West Parallel Runway. Work on NSPR is expected to be over by September 2019. The new runway will be CAT III B ILS-enabled and cater to all types of aircraft.
