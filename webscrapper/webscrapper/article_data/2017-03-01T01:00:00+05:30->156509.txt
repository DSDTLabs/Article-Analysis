Actor-filmmaker Cheran, who last directed  , we hear, is all set to wield the megaphone again. A source says that he has a script ready and that he is considering   to play the lead in it. When contacted,   tells us, “It is true that I’m directing a film. I’m currently searching for actors that suit my characters. I’m in talks with Vijay   to play the lead in this yet-to-be-titled project. If everything goes well, we will join hands.” Cheran’s previous outing was released through his unique initiative C2H, which received mixed reports. Meanwhile, it has to be seen if Sethupathi, who has half a dozen films in his kitty, will give a nod to the project.
