COLVA: The trial in the rape and murder case of British national Danielle  , commenced before additional session judge   on Friday, with the examination of the complainant, Prashant Komarpant.

 Last month, the court ordered accused   to be charged with murder, rape, robbery and destruction of evidence in the case.
 
 The complainant deposed that on March 14 last year, while he was on his way from his residence to his fields at 7am, he saw the naked corpse of a woman lying on her back with her face smashed, covered with blood.
 
 Public prosecutor Jerry D’Costa then showed the complainant’s photographs at the scene of offence and asked him to identify himself in the pictures. Defence advocate Arun Bras D’Sa objected, stating that the photos were dark and hazy and hence it was impossible for the complainant to identify himself. 
 
 When the judge questioned the witness as to how he identified himself in the photos, the complainant said he did so on the basis of the clothes and the cap he was wearing. The cross examination was adjourned for April 13.
