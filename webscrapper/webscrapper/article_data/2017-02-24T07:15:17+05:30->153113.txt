MUMBAI: Thursday's results exploded the myth that Muslims vote en bloc. Presence of multiple Muslim candidates in community pockets led to a split in votes. Though Muslim or Muslim-supported   candidates won from predominantly Muslim areas in south Mumbai, the loss of Muslim candidates in several other such areas underlined the division of community votes.

 The Congress retained four out of five seats in the Muslim-dominated Mumbadevi-Mohammed Ali Road belt. “The Muslims by and large backed the Congress candidates here even as they rejected the MIM candidates,“ said Congress MLA Amin Patel.
 
 Madanpura, which has over 80% Muslims, gave SP an opening in south Mumbai with Rais Shaikh's victory. However, gangster Arun Gawli's daughter Geeta Gawli's victory in ward 212 (Dagdi Chawl-Agriparada) suggested he still has support in the community. That  's two Muslim candidates won showed a tilt of a section of the community towards the saffron party.
