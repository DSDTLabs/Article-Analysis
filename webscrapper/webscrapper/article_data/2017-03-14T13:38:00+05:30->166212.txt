Veteran actress   still remains the "apple of the eye" to her fans. 

 Her aura is so alive till today and that is what has brought the actress back on screen with Gauri Shinde's 'English Vinglish'. Eventually, the movie went on to score big numbers at the box office and was declared a hit. 
 
 Following her re-entry, the actress is showered with offers which she rejected promptly. Only she made an appearance in 'Puli' ,a trilingual starring Vijay, which of course fell flat at the ticket window.
 
 Now, the actress is again up to offer another "mother" centric movie titled 'Mom'. This movie too, is a trilingual and is being bankrolled by her producer husband, Boney Kapoor. The makers of the movie recently released the first look of 'Mom' and it is already going viral on social media. 
 
 Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Akshay Khanna, Abhimanyu Singh and Vikas Verma played other pivotal roles in the movie which has music by A R Rahman. The movie, directed by Ravi Udyavar is set for a release on July 14.
