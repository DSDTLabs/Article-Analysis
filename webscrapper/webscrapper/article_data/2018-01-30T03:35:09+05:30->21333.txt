MUMBAI: It seems the municipal corporation may fail to meet its   target this financial year too. BMC, which had lost its biggest source of revenue—octroi—last year with goods ands services tax replacing it, was banking on property tax to boost its earnings. However, there is still a shortfall of Rs 1,880 crore from the target set for 2017-18.

 According to officials from the civic assessment and collector department, the property tax collected so far this financial year (2017-18) has been approximately Rs 3,320 crore. Last fiscal, till January, the BMC had earned approximately Rs 3,380 crore from property tax. In 2017-18, the BMC has set a Rs 5,200 crore target .
 
 In 2016-17, too, the property tax department had failed to meet its target. Till March 31, 2017, Rs 4,845 crore was collected in property tax as against the target of Rs 5,200 crore.
 
 With the   2018-19 scheduled on February 2, sources said, there is a possibility that the BMC may propose additional taxes to bridge the financial gap. BMC is the richest civic body in the country; it’s budget size in 2017-18 was Rs 25,141 crore. “We do not expect the size of the BMC Budget 2018-19 to either increase or reduce drastically,” said a senior civic official. The 2017-18 BMC Budget had witnessed a drop of almost Rs 10,000 crore, considering the 2016-17 budget, which was Rs 37,052 crore. 
 
 A civic official said they are working hard to meet this fiscal’s target for property tax collection. “In fact, on September 30, 2017, the deficit was very high, but we managed to bring it down by January,” said the official. “One of the major problems we face is that this is not a regular bill, like phone bill which can be disconnected in case of non-payment. Also, in many homes in south Mumbai, the bill does not reach the property owner, but the tenant.”
 
 The official added: “We take action against defaulters too. We first sent a warning letter and if they do not comply, we crack down on them either by sealing the property or disconnecting the water supply.”
 
 Another trend that officials have observed is that many citizens rush to pay the property tax in the last few days of the year. Last year, the municipal corporation had collected Rs 375 crore on March 31 alone.
