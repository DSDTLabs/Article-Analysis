NEW DELHI:   (NCB) is baffled at the sudden spike in cocaine being smuggled into the capital. The current seizure is the fourth in just one month and three of the accused were found to have swallowed the  .

 The supply and consumption of heroin has mysteriously dipped indicating how   addicts of the capital are more interested in snorting the white powder instead of jabbing the similar-looking drug. On January 11, NCB seized 975 grams of cocaine and on January 20, 2.975kg. On February 3, a staggering recovery of 4.02kg was made. Along with Wednesday’s recovery, the worth of seized cocaine has already crossed the Rs 50-crore mark.
 
 On the other hand, only two seizures of heroin have taken place during the same period and both consignments were less than a kilo and valued around Rs 1-2 crore. On January 9, NCB seized 785 grams and on January 28, 575 grams.
 
 Rajinder Pal Singh, deputy director general of NCB, attributes the growing detections to a better passenger screening and effective profiling system. 
 
 These seizures have also led the cops to identify the new epicentre of global cocaine cartels—Lome. The name of this capital city of the east African country, Togo, has come up in all operations conducted this year.
 
 Sources say that lax security at African airports, particularly Addis Ababa and Lome, have made them attractive places for cocaine transit. 
 
 The interrogation and details fished out from the passports of the arrested men and women reveal that cocaine consignments from Peru, Bolivia and Columbia first go to Brazil. From here, chartered flights are used to ship them to Africa. Most of the consignment is for Lome and Addis Ababa.
