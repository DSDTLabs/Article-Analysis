PUNE: Data provided by the   has revealed a dip in the number of vehicle registrations during   this year, which fell on Sunday.

 According to the RTO, a total of 5,350 vehicles — of different types — were registered with the office over the past three days, including Sunday. On Sunday alone, the   registered 113 twowheelers and 13 cars. But last year, the RTO registered a total of 605 vehicles on Gudi Padwa.
 
 
 But an RTO official said the registration process was still on. “We are talking figures so far. With registrations still on, it’s obvious the number of vehicles registered will only increase,” he said.
 
  resident Ravi Kadlag, who purchased a bike on Saturday, ensured he got the registration done on Sunday. “I have been wanting to buy a two-wheeler for over a month. But my parents asked me to wait until Gudi Padwa,” Kadlag, who works with a city travel agency, said.
 
 But an official of a twowheeler showroom at   admitted Sunday sales were low. “However, we have been seeing good numbers over the past three to four days. People tend to buy a new vehicle just before the festival. They only ensure registrations are done on the Gudi Padwa day. I am unable to provide exact figures, but we have sold over 300 units in the past three days,” the showroom official said.
 
 RTO officials said they were working until late on Sunday. “We decided to stay open on Sunday. It is an important day and people would want registrations done,” an official told TOI late on Sunday evening.
