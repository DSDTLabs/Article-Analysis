CHENNAI: A medical lab owner in Pudukkottai district of   was arrested on Monday for buying a six-month-old boy of a woman in   district. Four others, including two women, were also arrested in connection with the incident. 

 Police said P Kanaga, 34, of Kilaneri village in Madurai district had a daughter. She was a daily wage earner. While she was struggling to make both ends meet, a male child was born to her six months ago. Her husband, Palani Kumar, had deserted her before the second child was born. 
 
 Kanaga narrated her hardships to her neighbour A Rebecal, who works in a church. Rebecal gave her the idea of giving the child to someone who is childless so that the boy may get a better care. 
 
 Kanaga found it a good idea. However, she didnâ€™t realise that Rebecal was planning to make some money by selling the baby to someone. 
 
 Rebecal approached N Ramkumar of CAS Nagar in Avaniyapuram. They often took the boy away from the mother to show him to some potential buyers.
 
 Ramkumar with the help of a few   contacted Mani of Machavadi in Pudukottai district. Mani, who is running a medical lab, is a married man and has a daughter aged 12. He always wanted to have son. But he could not beget a son on his wife. 
 
 Mani negotiated with the middlemen and bought the boy for Rs 2.5 lakh. The money was shared among the middlemen. 
 
 When Kanaga learnt about the sale, she picked up a quarrel with Rebecal. She approached the Avaniyapuram police and filed a case.
 
 The police arrested Mani, 39, Rebecal, 57, Ramkumar, 33, J Suresh, 42, of Avaniyapuram and Indirani. They were searching for two others -- Janikiraman and Vairamuthammal -- in connection with the case.
