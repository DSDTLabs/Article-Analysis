 Students will be assessed in a written test on five subjects, including mathematics, English, social and natural sciences, and modern Indian languages. 
 
 Till now, NCERT held NAS once in three years, but from 2018-19, it will be held across the country every year. The survey will decide students of which state board are performing well. 
 
 District education officer (DEO) Ramkumar Falaswal said, “Heads of all participating schools are being alerted about the survey, so their students can prepare for it.”
 
 In past surveys, an improvement was reported in learning achievement levels of students, though they also revealed that mathematics and science are weak points for many students of both private and government schools.
 
 The DEO or sub-divisional education officer (SDEO) will hand over test material to heads of sampled schools at least three days before the date of the test.
 
 The findings will be used to plan and formulate policies and pedagogical interventions to improve student’s learning.
