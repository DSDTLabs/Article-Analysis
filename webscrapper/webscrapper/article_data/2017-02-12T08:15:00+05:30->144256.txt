JEWAR: Enthusiasm was high among senior citizens and the physically challenged who turned up to cast their votes as early as 8am on polling day. Many turned up at the spot, held by younger family members. In Parsaul village of  , of the Bhatta-Parsaul fame, 105-year-old Daryab Singh, possibly the oldest voter in the district, came out to cast his vote.

 Supported by a relative, Singh, who is hard of hearing, flashed a broad smile as he showed his inked finger. Chhotte Singh (90) walked almost a kilometre to the polling booth to cast his vote at Parsaul village’s Kisan Inter College. Nonagenarians and octogenarians turned up at the various polling booths to cast their votes. While the physically challenged were allowed to cast their votes before the others in the queue, issues like unclear photographs on the voter’s slip delayed some of them.
 
 While the district administration had said that wheelchairs would be provided at some booths,many elderly and disabled voters in villages of Jewar and Dadri could not get the facility. Booths, especially in rural areas, did not have ramps or wheelchairs. 
 
 Elsewhere, in Raj Nagar and Kavi Nagar areas of Muradnagar constituncy, a sizeable number of senior citizens turned up to vote. “As many as 60 votes have been cast so far, out of which 30% were elderly (60-plus)," said Sushir Narang, BJP agent from Raj Nagar.
