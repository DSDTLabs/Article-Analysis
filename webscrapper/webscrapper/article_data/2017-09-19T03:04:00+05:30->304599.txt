Panaji: The state-appointed lifeguard agency Drishti Lifesaving, on Monday, issued a safety   to locals and tourists for the next 96 hours in view of the heavy showers that are expected to continue over the coming days. 

 The agency has said that the weather and sea conditions are expected to be rough and has, therefore, strictly warned all citizens against venturing into the sea or indulging in water sports activities of any kind for the next few days. 
 
 “It is advisable to steer clear of the high tide line. Even wading into the sea can be risky,” the advisory stated. 
 
 Red flags have been erected across all beaches under Drishti’s surveillance, indicating these areas as strictly non-swim zones.
