KOLKATA: For those who miss the extended-family feeling, especially during Durga Puja, welfare associations (RWAs), or complexes, offer the next best thing. These RWAs bring people closer and give them the warmth of a family with many members. Connected at heart, residents in these complexes organize festivals as one big family and the best ones get their names on the top when it comes to unique competitions like Times Pujo Barir Shera Pujo (PBSP).

 In its 17th edition this year, PBSP will reach out to more than 250 such RWAs in all four regions of the city. Based on a number of parameters, the initial round of judging by Government Art College students will commence on Shashthi. The second round will see the senior students of the college shortlist 80 complexes. The final round of judging by celebrities on Ashtami will decide which pujas among 20 selected RWAs are the best in various categories. 
 
 The novelty factor this year is the number of new parameters included for judging the best pujas. These parameters have been fixed in keeping with contemporary needs such as cleanliness on the puja premises, energy-saving initiatives, best innovation and housing complex CSR activities. The existing ones, like every year, include best idol, pandal décor, idol’s ornaments, cultural programmes and TOI branding at the pandals.
 
 This year, PBSP is powered by Amit International with comfort partner Khadim’s;   partner National Insurance Company Ltd; lifestyle partner Johnson Tiles; entertainment partner Inox; jewellery partner Senco Gold & Diamonds and Shera Bhog partner IFB Appliances. The event is being organized in association with Goenka Inc., LIC   Ltd, Pincon Mustard Oil, Santra Publication and SRMB Real Edge and co-sponsored by GKB Opticals.
