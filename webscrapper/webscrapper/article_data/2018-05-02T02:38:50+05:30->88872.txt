KALYAN:   late on Monday intercepted a tempo on the   highway and seized around 7.5 tonnes of meat, suspected to be beef. Tempo driver Mohammed Ansari (40) has been arrested, a police official said.

Later, police along with local civic officials disposed of the seized meat by burying it into the soil, Surve said. "We have arrested the driver and are interrogating him to find out since when he was involved in meat transportation since he did not have the requisite licence when we caught him," Surve added.
