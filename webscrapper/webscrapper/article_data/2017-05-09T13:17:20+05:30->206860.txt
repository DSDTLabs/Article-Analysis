KOLHAPUR: Several parts of the city ran dry on Monday due to the pipeline work near Puikhadi water treatment plant. The situation in ward E was worse and the corporators had to resort for private water tankers.

 The civic body had earlier informed the residents about the water cut in A,B and E wards of the city. A 800 mm diameter water pipeline from   pumping station had to be replaced and connected to 1,100 mm pipeline. The repair work was completed by evening.
 
 Areas falling under the   in ward E were deployed only two tankers. The corporators had to struggle to get those two tankers on time.
 
 A corporator from Salokhenagar, Pratiksha Patil said, “We have been facing water cut in our area since Sunday afternoon. Only two tankers have been deployed till now. We had to struggle to get even one trip of the water tanker here.”
 
 On the other hand, the residents in wards A and B did not have to struggle for water. The   Municipal Corporation ( ) had deployed six water tankers in the area. Moreover, the water was stored in the high rise water tankers located in the area. The water supply department claims that the residents of E ward will not have to face irregularality in water supply anymore.
 
 S K Kulkarni, chief hydraulic engineer of KMC said, “The residents of E ward suffer the most during cuts because are only few tanks available for storage in that area. After the repair in this pipeline, the ward E residents will get enough water. During water cuts, tankers are deployed across different wards and by the time it reaches E ward there is not enough water to serve the residents there.”
 
 “We cannot speculate the demand in a particular area. Tankers are deployed depending on the size and the population of the area. We will make sure that enough water is provided across the wards by Monday evening. The water supply be normalised from Tuesday morning, he added.”
