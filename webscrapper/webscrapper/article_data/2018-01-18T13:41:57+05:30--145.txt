NAGPUR: The state information technology secretary (adjudicating officer) has directed   company and its franchise to pay Rs 10,000 to a complainant for causing mental agony to him by blocking his   card and issuing a duplicate one to a fraudster based on fake documents.

 “The respondents have definitely been non-serious and negligent in implementing and maintaining reasonable security practices and procedures regarding scrutiny of documents, confirmation of facts, ensuring availability of   footage. They created conducive environment for the fraudster to get unauthorized access to the SIM carrying data/information, and related to personal and business entitlements of the complainant with mala fide intention, to cause wrongful loss to the complainant,” principal secretary   ruled.
 
 The adjudicator further held that irreversible consequences could have been avoided by the alert complainant himself by lodging a complaint. He made it imperative to pay a compensation failing which a compound interest of 12% monthly would be chargeable.
 
 Complainant Nirmalkumar Athawale’s mobile services were abruptly stopped by the service provider on June 1, 2015. He lodged a complaint the very next day with the franchise through counsel and cyber law consultant  , and even with the police to prevent any misuse of his card.
 
 On further investigation, it came to light that the services were blocked on the basis of fake documents submitted to the company. As if this was not enough, the company had even issued a duplicate SIM card to a fraudster on the same date, without properly verifying the documents submitted by him.
 
 The next day, the complainant was able to resume his services after persistent follow-ups with the mobile service provider.
