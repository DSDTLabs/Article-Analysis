LUCKNOW: Under the new excise policy which has come into effect from April 1, the timings of liquor shops have been slashed by three hours daily across UP. Earlier, the shops were allowed to remain open from 9 am to 11pm but as per the new policy, liquor vendors would now start the day at 12 noon and wind up by 10pm. 

 The change in timing, coupled with supply crunch, has resulted into unprecedented overcrowding outside liquor shops between 9.30pm and 10pm on a daily basis.
 
 The state excise department, however, emphasized that the reduced business hours would not impact revenue as the changed policy would keep curb smuggling and spurious liquor trade henceforth.
 
 UP excise minister   maintained that the liquor supply hit a roadblock due to hiccups in introducing track-and-trace system. Singh, who is   from Bansi, Siddharthnagar, said that in the new policy, government has done away with holograms and introduced bar codes instead.
 
 "Movement of consignment between brewery and bonded warehouse can be tracked live and through track-and-trace system it would also be known when exactly was liquor manufactured and bottled. But since it is a software-based system, its implementation is taking some time. The demand and supply gap would be stabilized within three to four days," assured Singh over the phone and added that the situation would improve by Monday.
 
 Liquor traders, however, are facing financial pressure.  , who was awarded a shop in   area of the city in the e-lottery draw, said that beer business has been hit the most. "Traders have suffered losses of lakhs of rupees in last 10 days due to excise department's lack of preparedness. And that too when we paid double this time to get license," said Maurya.
 
 The department had asked all applicants to deposit security fee along with the applications this time and raked in lot of money.
