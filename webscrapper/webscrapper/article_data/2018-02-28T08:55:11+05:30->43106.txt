CHARMINAR: Telangana   Medical Officers Association (TUMOA) has urged the state government to open Sir Nizamat Jung Hospital at Narayanguda.

 Dr AA Khan, general secretary, TUMOA, said   consisting of 120 beds is yet to start operation, though land for the hospital was endowed by   for promoting Unani medicine. “Nizam Jung Bahadur endowed more than 3,000 square yards land for promotion of Unani medicine and construction of Unani Shifa Khana in Narayanguda. But the hospital building has turned into a godown. The first and second floor and cellars are dumped with expired medicines,” said Khan.
 
 “The authorities got permission to store several medicines in the hospital building, but in return, neither the director nor additional director helped,” added Khan.
 
 The association further told 
  that members had visited the hospital and found several medicine bottles and cartons kept in the building.
 
 “We want the government to open a Unani hospital in the new city as well so that many people can avail the facility,” he added.
 
 “The association wants the hospital to be started as soon as possible, but the present authorities are taking it easy. We want the concerned authorities to remove medicines from the building. Those behind this neglect must be suspended,” said a TUMOA official.
 
 Earlier, the association members met AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi and Charminar MLA   with regard to Unani teaching, promotions and other issues. “We met AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi and Charminar MLA Pasha Quadri regarding our problems. Both of them have assured us to raise this issue in THE coming assembly session,” added Khan.
