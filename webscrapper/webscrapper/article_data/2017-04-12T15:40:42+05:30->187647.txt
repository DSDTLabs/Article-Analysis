The first half of the   starrer   is quite engaging, and it is filled with many gripping scenes, that could keep the audience in the edge-of-their-seats. 

 The film, which is 2 hours 17 minutes, delves deep into how demonetisation has affected people from different ladders of the society. That said, the focal point of the movie is on the upper-class Malayalis.
 
  
  
 Mammootty plays the role of a Kasaragod-based business man Nithyananda Shenoy. He is a daredevil in every aspect, who prefers to take befitting steps in life. He looks extremely elegant, and handles the slang with finesse. Nithyananda Shenoy is the paradigm of style and substance. 
 
 Ineya does a convincing job as the Tamilian Sundari, the mother of an eighth grader Muthuvel. 
 
 Though the Kasaragod slang isn't much easy to understand at many junctures, but it's not largely a hindrance to get into the mood of the film, which traverses various timeframes. 
 
 At the intermission, the film indeed evokes a sense of curiosity and excitement on what would happen to the 'that key factor' of the story, everyone is on the lookout for.
