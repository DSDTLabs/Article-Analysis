AHMEDABAD: For the past month, 12-year-old   has been wearing a pastel coloured helmet while cycling to school. This is no fad but an example of a citizen being responsible for his own safety. “What if I fall from the bicycle? I have to ensure my safety,” said Nirav, who is among 3,000 students in Ahmedabad who have not just taken to wearing helmets while on a two-wheeler, even when riding pillion, but have also encouraged their parents to wear helmets.

 These students attended a series of traffic safety and awareness workshops for schoolchildren and their parents. “My father hardly wore a helmet while using a two wheeler,” said Madhavi Patel, a class VIII student of a city-based school, who attended the workshop
 
  
  This initiative was undertaken by city-based educationist, Geetika Saluja, to spread awareness at more than 20 schools in the city. She said, “The idea was to not just educate children about traffic safety. It was to ensure their safety as well. We conducted workshops to encourage students to wear helmets even when they ride pillion with their parents as the habit of wearing a helmet won’t come instantly as they turn 18 and get a driving licence.”
 
 Saluja also facilitated the distribution of some 3,000 helmets to such students, which they could claim after showing a copy of a parent’s driving licence. “It is heartening to see how the kids not just put on helmets themselves but also encouraged their parents to do so,” she says.
 
 “Some students at our school are sensitized and now wear helmets even when they ride bicycles to school,” said Mihir Desai, director, Nest Public School, Ranip.
 
 “I did neglect wearing a helmet, especially for short distances, but after attending the workshop and my son spoke to me about the safety of the pillion rider, I am determined to make sure that I and any companion put on helmets when on the road,” said  , who works for a private company.
