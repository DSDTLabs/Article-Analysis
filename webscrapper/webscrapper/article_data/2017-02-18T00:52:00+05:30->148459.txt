Hyderabad: Neredmet police on Friday arrested a 22-year-old labourer for eloping with a 17-year-old girl and marrying her.

 The accused, Anjaneyulu of Vanaparthi in Mahbubnagar district, was in love with the   girl from Vanaparthi. The girl’s family members were against the relationship and sent her to stay with a relative in Vayupuri Colony, Neredmet, last year. 
 
 However, despite the distance from the victim, Anjaneyulu managed to contact her. In June 2016, he took her away from her relative’s house, Neredmet inspector M Jagdish Chander said. Anjaneylu later married the girl and started living with her. 
 
 Based on a complaint lodged by the girl’s family, police managed to trace the couple at Neredmet on Friday. “We have arrested Anjaneylu under section 366 A (Kidnapping a minor girl) and section 376 (Rape) of the IPC. The girl was sent to state home for rehabilitation,” the inspector said. tnn
