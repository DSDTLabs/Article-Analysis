GREATER NOIDA: Two months after the  , a visit to   on   indicates that nothing has changed. The road from Jewar leads straight to Kakod, some 25 km away. Sabota village is merely one kilometer from the Yamuna expressway.

 The road wore a deserted look in the afternoon on Sunday. There were no police personnel or any police van on the stretch. DGP Sulkhan Singh had visited the spot in June and promised that the stretch will have proper lighting system but there is none at place till now. 
 
 “The police had beefed up patrolling for a few days after the gang rape. As the matter settled down, they have reduced their patrolling. Travelling through the route is a serious threat, especially at night,” said Radhe Mohan, a local resident.
 
 The road divides the two villages of Sabota Mustafabad and Ramner —on left and right side where the incident took place. There is a police chowki in Ranhera some 10 kilometres away. There was a police constable at the chowki who said that they go for patrol in the evening.
 
 Local residents said that incidents of loot and robbery were frequent in May, June and July. In March and April, farmers visit the fields due to harvesting season. The following months are dull period and hence criminals commit crime and fled. “We have improved patrolling in the area ever since the crime. We will talk to the concerned authority to lit up the road,” said a police officer.
