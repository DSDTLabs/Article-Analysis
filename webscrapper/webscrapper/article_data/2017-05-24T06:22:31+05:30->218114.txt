LUCKNOW: The   has directed   to prepare database of medical stores and pharmacists in whose name the stores are registered in order to ascertain how genuine the person running   is. It granted three months to state government to complete the task and also ordered to connect database with   of owners and pharmacists. It further directed the state authorities to take action against dubious or unqualified persons running medical stores and furnish report in the court after a month.

 Petitioners had alleged that registered pharmacists were very few compared to the large number of medicine retail shops. “It is mandatory for every medicine shop to have a registered pharmacist but unqualified persons or those using registration certificate of others are operating shops but the state government has not taken any preventive steps,” said the PIL. 
 
 Government counsel said a meeting was held on March 22 in which it was decided to prepare database of registered pharmacists. The court directed secretary, medical, health and family welfare to issue necessary instructions to all concerned drug inspectors and drug licensing authority to bring requirement for registered pharmacists to the notice of all drug retailers.
 
 The bench directed state to ensure if there is any duplication or fictitious or unauthorised persons were running retail medical shops and if such cases were found, appropriate action be taken within one month after preparation of database.
