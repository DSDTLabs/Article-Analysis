BATHINDA: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) activists protested outside Rampura Phul police station against the registration of a case against its candidate from the constituency, Manjit Singh, for allegedly trespassing and assaulting a Congress worker on March 13 who had defected from the Arvind Kejriwal-headed outfit.

 At the protest, AAP MP Sadhu Singh and party MLAs Rupinder Kaur Ruby (Bathinda Rural), Jagdev Singh Kamalu (Maur), Manjit Singh (Nihal Singh Wala), and   Meet Hayer (Barnala) described the case as “politically motivated”. They demanded cancellation of the case. However, police rubbished the charge.
 
 Manjit was booked for house tresspass and causing hurt on March 13, after a complaint by Congress worker Jaskaran Bansal. He had alleged that Manjit and his supporters barged into his house and assaulted him.
 
 Even as Sadhu Singh claimed that Manjit had been booked on political considerations, Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP)   said they had enough evidence to book the AAP leader. “The case has been registered on merit. There is proof showing that the AAP leader barged into Bansal’s house with his supporters and beat him up,” the SSP said. 
 
 Sadhu Singh said the FIR was “sheer injustice with our senior leader”. “Manjit had not entered Bansal’s house. In fact, he had gone to his neighbour’s place and AAP volunteer  . Congress has started victimizing AAP leaders. We will not tolerate this at any cost,” he said, while addressing party workers at the protest.
 
 Ruby described the case as the fallout of “vendetta politics” practised by the Congress. “We will oppose all such misadventures,” she said.
