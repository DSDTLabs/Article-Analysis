HYDERABAD: Power consumption hit all-time high in   with Discoms saying that on Monday they supplied 201 million units (more than 9,950 MW) surpassing previous high of 197 million units this year. 

 The power consumption in the state has increased sharply in February with the rise in day temperature. Increase in demand from domestic sector coupled with 24-hour power supply to agriculture has resulted in a steep hike in the overall power demand. As   season picks up, the state power utilities are anticipating more than 11000 MW power demand. Earlier, it was estimated that the overall demand will not be more than 10,000 MW.
 
 "We have revised the estimates as the power consumption is showing a steep upward movement due to increased industrial and agriculture consumption. Industries, domestic and agriculture sectors are provided 24-hour power supply without any restrictions. No other state in the country is able to achieve this," D  , chairman and managing director of Telangana Transco and   told TOI. 
 
 Power consumption in the state has reported a record high of 185 million units on April, 1, 2017 after the formation of the state. This was surpassed to touch 197 million units in September, 2017. While thermal power stations have contributed 3092 MW per day, Hydel stations delivered 687 MW power and Solar power stations 2164 MW to the state grid. 
 
 Inter-state generating stations have supplied 3,950 MW while bilateral agreements have delivered 1259 MW to Telangana. To meet sudden spurt in the power demand, the power utilities are purchasing about 750 MW power from power exchanges during the peak time.
 
 The Transco has made elaborate arrangements to handle huge spike in the power demand by strengthening transmission and distribution lines by spending over 1600 crore.
