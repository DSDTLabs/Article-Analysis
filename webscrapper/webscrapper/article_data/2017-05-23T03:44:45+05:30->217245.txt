GURUGRAM: The boundary wall of the newly constructed towers of  ,  , collapsed during the rain and thunderstorm on Sunday evening. 

 The boundary wall, 6ft high and 120ft long, was built to separate the under-construction towers from  , a residential society. 
 
 The collapse has given rise to doubts about the construction material being used by the builder. Both residents and home buyers questioned the safety measures being taken by the builder. “The construction work began in 2013-14. The boundary wall gave way in just three years. I’m one of those who have booked a flat in the project, and this incident has left me worried about the construction material the builder is using in the towers,” said  , a resident of Parsavnath Exotica, who has also bought an apartment in the new towers.
 
 “It is disgusting to see a boundary wall coming down after showers that lasted only for half an hour. Fortunately, there were no cars parked nearby,” said Monisha, a resident of Parsavnath Exotica. 
 
 The developer, though, called it a minor incident as there was no loss of property or life. “Currently, there are only labourers working at the spot. The wall collapse happened due to soil erosion. Such incidents can happen anywhere. Construction of towers can’t be compared to construction of the boundary wall, as the latter is unstructured,” said Vivek Garg, vice-president of Parsavnath.
