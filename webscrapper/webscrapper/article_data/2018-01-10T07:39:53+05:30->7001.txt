CHANDIGARH: Two persons, one from each faction, were killed when two groups clashed with over a six-year-old issue in Namunda village of Samalkha sub-division of Panipat on Monday.

 Heavy police deployment was made in the village after police handed over bodies of both the deceased following their postmortem. Police have booked 22 people in two different cases of murder, rioting and assault, registered against members of both the groups.
 
 Three persons, including Rajinder and  , brothers of Dharminder Singh, and one Tara Chand, brother of Jagdish, have been arrested. “Both the families are immediate neighbours. After making three arrests, we are now looking at the role of others who are directly involved in the incident,’’ said Panipat SP  .
 
 According to information, families of Dharminder and Jagdish Chand had clashed with each other six year ago over the issue of parking of Dharminder’s car near Jagdish’s house. While the issue was resolved, the two families reportedly continued to hold a grudge against one another.
 
 On Monday night, Dharminder’s car in which his brother Rajinder was also seated, brushed against Jagdish and his father. This triggered a fresh clash.
 
 Jagdish and his family members, including his brothers, sons and nephews, lynched Dharminder.
 
 Meanwhile, enraged over the death of his elder brother, Rajinder went home and returned with a licenced gun and opened fire on Jagdish and his family members. Jagdish died on the spot and some family members suffered pellet injuries.
 
 Police was called and senior officers, including SP Rahul Sharma rushed to the spot. Forensic experts also reached the scene of crime to collect evidence.
