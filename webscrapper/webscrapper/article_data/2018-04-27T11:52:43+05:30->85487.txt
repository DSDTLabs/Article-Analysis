GUWAHATI:Barely days after kicking up a storm with his remark that Internet existed even in the days of Mahabharata, Tripura chief minister Biplab Deb on Thursday said   doesn’t represent Indian beauty, only Aishwarya Rai does.

 Claiming that the decision to award Miss World and Miss Universe titles to Indian women five years in a row was market-driven, Deb said only Aishwarya Rai was a quintessential representative of Indian beauty.
 
 Speaking at a design workshop in Agartala, Deb said, “Indian beauty should ideally look like Goddesses Lakshmi and Saraswati. Diana Hayden did not deserve to win the Miss World crown. Actually, it was part of a fixed plan which was hatched keeping in mind the interests of the international market. Aishwarya Rai’s victory was well deserved as she represents the quintessential Indian woman.”
 
 “Indian women did not use cosmetics or shampoo. We washed our hair with ‘methi’ water to prevent hairfall and bathed with mud. Beauty contest organisers are international marketing mafia that tried to capture a market of 125 crore Indians with their move,” Deb said, adding that Indian women no longer win international beauty contests as organisers have already captured the market.
 
 Deb’s media advisor Sanjay Mishra told TOI, “The chief minister made the remark on Diana Hayden in the context of how international cosmetic companies fix the outcome of beauty pageants to capture the market in a particular country. The chief minister was only trying to promote India’s own traditional ways.”
