Ahmedabad: The government of Japan expects Indian tourist footfall in Japan to reach 40 million by 2020. Ryoji Noda, consul general of Japan in Mumbai, who inaugurated an exclusive exhibition on tourism in Japan in Ahmedabad on Monday, said the Land Of The Rising Sun has a lot to offer on its tourist landscape. 

 The exhibition ‘Japan Calling’, was put together by Japan Information and Study Centre, Ahmedabad Management Association (AMA) and Indo Japan Friendship Association (IJFA) – Gujarat, at AMA and will conclude on Tuesday.
 
 
 “After Japan PM, Shinzo Abe, visited Gujarat in 2017, there has been greater interest in promoting tourism so that it will facilitate cultural and people-to-people interaction between India and Japan. In fact, Gujarat and Japan have strong bilateral collaboration with major Japanese investments in Gujarat including the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar Metro and High-Speed Rail connectivity from Ahmedabad to Mumbai,” said Noda.
 
 Mukesh Patel, president, IJFA – Gujarat, said, who was also present at the inauguration ceremony, said, “With increasing business collaborations between Japan and Gujarat, it is imperative to boost tourism so that people in the two regions know and interact with one another.”
 
 Currently, the number of Indians travelling to Japan is 1.2 lakh, which is quite low, says Kenichi Takano, executive director, Japan National Travel Organisation (JNTO). “The number of tourists from China are six times higher than what Japan has been getting from India. We have a lot to offer in terms of tourism including heritage, monuments, festivals and cultures and scenic landscapes,” he explained.
