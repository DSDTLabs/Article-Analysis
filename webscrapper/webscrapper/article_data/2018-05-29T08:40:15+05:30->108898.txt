KOCHI:   virus cases in the state maybe under control now, but   (WHO) makes it clear that it is a latent disease that could resurface months to years after initial infection.

 
 “Patients typically present late in the clinical course of disease which decreases the likelihood of successful treatment,” says WHO’s draft   (R&D) Roadmap released in May 2018.
 
 After the disease is confirmed, then there is no medicine for Nipah virus as “economic incentives to invest in Nipah research are not readily apparent, as the disease primarily occurs in under-resourced areas of   and disease incidence is low,” the document adds.
 
 Referring to the two drugs that the state government is relying on –– Ribavirin and human monoclonal antibody (mAb) from   — to treat the disease, WHO admits that though it is an option, their efficacy is not yet known.
 
 “There are currently no vaccines or treatments approved for human use in Nipah virus cases. Though studies show that Ribavirin is an accepted or approved treatment for several viral infections, including Nipah, there are also studies against it that showed that Ribavirin treatment only delayed but did not prevent death,” said Dr   S, Center for Public Health, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Kochi.
 
 “Ideally, to be effective, these medicines should be given to patients at the initial stage of the disease. But we are not able to detect cases early to start early treatment,” added Dr   R, head, Department of Infectious Diseases, Kottayam Medical College.
