MARGAO: Governor Mridula Sinha on Thursday urged women to focus on inner personality development rather than be unduly obsessed with the fight for women’s equality, even as she expressed her disapproval towards objectification of women.

 “Instead, the virtues which a woman nurtures within herself should lead to development of a virtuous society thereby leading to glorification of our country,” Sinha said while addressing a gathering on the occasion of International Women’s Day celebrations at Ravindra Bhavan,  . Pointing out that women have always been placed on a higher pedestal in our country since Vedic times, Sinha called for standing against women’s exploitation. 
 
  collector Anjali Sehrawat spoke on the need for women empowerment and creating equal opportunities for women. 
 
 Internationally acclaimed fashion designers, Riddhi and Siddhi Mapxencar, and Verma D’Mello, and well-known Goan singer   were felicitated by Sinha. President of Ravindra Bhavan, Margao, Prashant Naik, and   chairperson Babita Angle Prabhudessai were present.
