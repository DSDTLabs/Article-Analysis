KOCHI: With only one-and-a-half months left to meet the deadline set by the state government to the amnesty scheme for   to pay their taxes in Kerala, only 53 vehicles have been registered in the district so far.

 
 It has been found that 251 vehicles, including high-end and ordinary cars registered in Puducherry, in the district need to be registered to Kerala. With 53 vehicles registered under the Assignment of   (RMA), motor vehicles department (MVD) has garnered Rs 5crore.
 
 
 “Vehicle owners from Kerala who have registered their vehicle in the Union Territory secure noobjection certificate (NOC) from   for registration in the home state. As the government is hell bent on zeroing in on these vehicles, owners pay tax even before securing   from Puducherry,” said an MVD official in  .
 
 The MVD has issued a showcause notice to 112 vehicle owners in the district and the process on the rest of the vehicles is progressing.
 
 The state government in the budget had announced the amnesty scheme and asked owners to register the vehicles, which were registered in Puducherry, in the home state before April 30.
 
 If the owner fails to follow the scheme, the government will take legal procedures against the owner.
