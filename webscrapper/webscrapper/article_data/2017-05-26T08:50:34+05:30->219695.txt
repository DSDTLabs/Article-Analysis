CHENNAI: In the second time in less than a month, food safety officers on Thursday caught   selling   unlabelled and soiled   at two government hospitals in   here. 

 Based on a tip-off, food safety officers landed at the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and found a vendor selling water on the campus at Rs 8 a bottle. Another man was caught selling water on the pavement just outside the Institute of Child Health from a container that had multiple labels. Around 40 cans were seized.
 
 Food safety officer A Chandrasekaran, who inspected the hospitals along with two other officers, said four samples were collected and sent for testing. “Last time, the vendors were just let off with a warning. This time, if the samples are found to be non-potable, the department can take action,” he said. 
 
 During questioning, the vendors said they had bought the water cans from a dealer nearby for Rs 40. The water was then sold to patients and their attendants.
 
 On May 11, food safety officers caught the same two vendors selling water from soiled cans in the hospitals.
