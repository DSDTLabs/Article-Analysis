Chandigarh: Discussions between the faculty of United Kingdom-based Nottingham Business School (NBS) and PU’s University Business School (UBS) came to an end here on Saturday.

 During their four-day visit to  , NBS representatives Martin Jones and Banita Lal had discussed subjects ranging from joint academic events to student and faculty exchange with their counterparts at UBS. On the last day, Jones, the head of department of accounting and finance at NBS, presented many possibilities for collaborative activities that had been thrashed out over the four days of meetings with faculty from different specializations, research scholars, students and alumni of University Business School. These included development of case studies, joint research and conferences, student exchange visits to develop a cross-cultural perspective, sharing teaching resources through arrangements like global-classroom facility, jointly developing and sharing online resources, and cross-institutional support for the doctoral programme.
 
 PU vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar Grover, in his presidential address, emphasized the “critical juncture” that public universities were at. “They are facing great competition and have to think innovatively and work hard to stay at the top,” he said, asking UBS’s faculty to “seize the wonderful opportunities coming its way”. 
 
 He said Panjab University’s good standing had brought it strong partnerships from the Midlands Cluster in the UK – universities from Nottingham and Birmingham. Nottingham Trent University, since the signing of the MoU with Panjab University two and a half years ago, has initiated and facilitated multiple faculty and student visits, he added.
 
 Prof Grover discussed the importance of a joint international MBA programme offered by UBS and NBS, and its benefits for both institutions. UBS chairperson Professor Deepak Kapur assured the vice-chancellor that UBS would indeed move forward on these lines.
