BENGALURU: Pointing out that policies of   in the name of globalization, led by the US, are rapidly depleting the rights of Dalits, women and other backward sections of society, Kannada writers said on Saturday that these policies have become tools to reinforce inequalities. 

 "If there was globalization without privatization, without the US leading it, one could probably accept it, for exchange of knowledge and technology is not a new thing introduced in the 1990s. However, the US, which blackmails countries with its defence capabilities -- Iran and   are just examples -- has ensured nothing but inequality,"   Banjagere Prakash said, at the 'Reclaiming Social Justice, Revisiting Ambedkar' conference to mark the 126th birth anniversary of B R Ambedkar.
 
  Terming the US the "Brahmin of the world", he said: "Just like Brahmins, the US holds on to knowledge, sometimes even such knowledge that's not its own, by way of patents, and thrives by creating inequality. The upper caste ruling class in India is toeing the line to reinforce inequalities of the caste system that our Constitution aims to remove."
