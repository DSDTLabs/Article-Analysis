 Top SIT sources said that with the verdict out in June 2016, they have already crossed the 90-day deadline for appeal in the high court of Gujarat.
 
 “Now even if the state home department sanctions the appeal in the case, reasons for delay will have to be explained,” said a top investigator.
 
 SIT sources said they have sent several reminders to the state home department with the latest sent about a fortnight ago. The reminder seeks capital punishment for 11 convicts who have been sentenced to life imprisonment, enhancement of punishment for 13 and challenge of the acquittal of 13 out 36 accused - including BJP corporator Bipin Patel.
 
 It is worthy to note that 69 people were killed - including former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri in the Gulbarg Society massacre during the riots which broke out after the Godhra train burning incident at Godhra railway station in February 2002. Fifty-nine people had been burnt to death in the train burning.
 
 The investigation was handed over to SIT and about 66 accused were arrested in the case. The SIT court had convicted 24 while 36 were acquitted in June 2016. The court had rejected the charge of criminal conspiracy against all 66 accused.
 
 Rupa Mody, mother of “Parzania” boy Azhar Mody, who was killed in the Gulbarg massacre, has recently appealed in the Gujarat high court against acquittal of 36 accused and also for enhancement of punishment of the convicts.
