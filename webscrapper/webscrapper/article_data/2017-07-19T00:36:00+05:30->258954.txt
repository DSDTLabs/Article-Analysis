Chandigarh: The municipal corporation here on Tuesday submitted an amended proposal of an MoU to the National Green Tribunal (NGT).

 Jaiprakash Associates Limited, which runs the garbage processing plant at Dadumajra, has framed an MoU in which the civic body has made certain changes. The case is listed for hearing on July 29. Asha Jaswal, mayor, on Monday had conducted a meeting of all councillors to discuss the MoU between the MC and Jaiparkash Associates Ltd. It was decided that the company would set up a compost plant of 300 MT capacity on the existing premises at Dadumajra within three months at its own cost and shall make it fully operational within six months. The company will have to take steps to improve the functioning of the existing plant, which at present is running at sub-optimum capacity.
 
 The MC will continue to pay the tipping fee against an equal amount of bank guarantee, subject to inspection of the plant by a competent court of arbitration and a high-power independent committee constituted by the NGT with regard to its functioning at regular intervals and shall submit its report to it. The company will upgrade the existing RDF plant to its optimum capacity within three weeks. The MCC will restrict the supply of waste to 100-150 MT per day till July 30. In case the company fails to fulfil its agreements within the prescribed time limit, the plant will be handed to the MC free of cost.
 
 As per official record, the city generates around 400 tonnes of municipal solid waste daily. Jaiprakash Associates Limited is running the Dadumajra garbage processing plant, which processes approximately 75 per cent of the garbage while the rest is being thrown at the dumping ground. The corporation entered a contract with the firm in 2005 but have been at the loggerheads over various issues.
