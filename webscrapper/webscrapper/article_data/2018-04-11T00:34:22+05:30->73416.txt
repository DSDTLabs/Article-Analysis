Chennai: Three   stations that will link a part of North Chennai with the underground transit hub at Central Metro covering a distance of about 5kms are almost ready. But commuters may have to wait till the end of this year, as Chennai Metro Rail will open the line along with the nearly 5 km stretch on Anna Salai between Central Metro and AG-DMS.

 A metro rail official said work in three underground stations of corridor 1- Washermenpet, Mannadi and High Court stations are nearing completion. Critical electrical and electronic systems required to operate trains are being installed. “Tracks have been laid and installation of OHE and signalling systems are underway,” said the official.
 
 However, the stations will not open unless four underground stations that connects a part of Anna Salai- May Day Park, Government Estate, LIC and Thousand Lights are ready. At present, construction of the stations are in full swing. “Since the stretch between Washermenpet to Central Metro and the Anna Salai line is part of the same corridor, we will not be able to operate trains unless all systems are installed till AG-DMS,” an official said. Once the underground line along Anna Salai is ready, it will connect Washermenpet up to Airport via Anna Salai and a part of GST Road. Commuters will also be able to reach Airport from Central Metro via the line under Poonamallee High Road through a direct service.
 
  “Some of the features and systems in the upper track towards Poonamallee high road and the lower track towards Anna Salai are connected. So, we have to get both the track levels ready before we begin operations at Central,” an official said.
 
 Some of these stations on Anna Salai is being linked with the existing pedestrian subways for easy access for both pedestrians and commuters. Pedestrians will also be able to use underground metro rail stations to cross the main junctions at Teynampet and Nandanam through the non-paid area where there are no pedestrian subways.
