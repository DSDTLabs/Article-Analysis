 The album begins with Kadhal Project, that starts on a melodious note, giving you a false impression that it will be a melody. But Benny Dayal gives the required punch to this western track. A hummable track, the other singers include Keerthana Vaidyanathan, Sharanya Gopinath, Yazin Nizar. The composer does have a classical inclination that is evident in the violin interlude. Keerthana and Sharanya do their best. Benny also gets a chance to show his classical expertise in the second charanam. The fusion of western and classical tunes makes this one a good listen. 
 
 Yavvana is one track that is already a hit on radio channels. An out-and-out romantic number, this one has prominent drum and guitar portions. And to add to the beauty, Kalyani Nair’s mellifluous voice gives the melody its soul, as opposed to Yazin Nizar, who enhances the track with his raw voice. The lyrics by Madhan Karky are also a plus. There is also a reprise version by Keerthana Vaidyanathan, which is sure to stir some emotions in the listener. With minimal instruments and a beautiful flute bit, we give this version also a thumbs-up. 
 
 After all the romance comes an electronic track, Sangu. Crooned by the composer himself, this one is heavy on guitar and drum. Simon has also used subtle kuthu beats in the track. There is also an Area Version of the song, with almost similar instruments. We think this version is a wasted effort. The lyrics, however, are different and written by Rokesh. Finally, there is In Search For Sathya — a theme song that begins with eerie violin portions. The tempo fastens and has that mystery element in it. The theme is a little quirky and has been well-orchestrated. Overall, the album impresses.
