PATNA: The Mother’s Day was celebrated in the city on Sunday with many restaurants lining up   on the occasion.

 “We usually do not have customers waiting for tables in the morning hours, but as it was Mother’s Day, our restaurant remained 80% booked. We had special dishes for the occasion, which included Parsi cuisine Aamchi Rustam Biryani, Bengal’s famous sarson (mustard) fish and Tamil Nadu’s chicken Chettinad, among others. We also launched a pan kulfi on the occasion that was well loved by the mothers,” sad Rupa Sinha, owner of a restaurant near Maurya Lok Complex.
 
 Another restaurant in Bandar Bagicha had planned the day filled with fun. “A large number of customers turned up to celebrate Mother’s Day since morning. A special buffet was arranged where mothers could order ‘all you can drink free mocktails’. Every mother who came received a rose and a chocolate,” said general manager of the restaurant Debdutta Bapuji.
 
 Reshu Agarwal, an event manager, made a special sugar-free ‘halwa cake’ for her mother whose mother Saroj Agarwal cooked a special breakfast for Reshu and her brother. “Our firm had also put up a stall on Exhibition Road where children could get a picture with their mothers with a ‘Pyaari Maa’ backdrop. We gave the children small gifts for their mothers,” she said.
 
 All were not lucky to spend and enjoy the day with their mothers. Delhi-based lawyer Tulika Singh’s mother is a family counsellor based in Patna. “I sent her a pair of earrings on the occasion. She will be visiting me by the end of the month,” said Tulika over phone. 
 
 Similarly, Dr Nikhat Alam celebrated a lonely Mother’s Day. All three of her daughters are in the US. “They all sent me sweet wishes. All are planning to come for Eid,” she said.
