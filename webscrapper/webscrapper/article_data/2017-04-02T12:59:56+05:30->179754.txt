COIMBATORE: The deadlock over the   highway   would soon be resolved and the project would be completed within two months, a senior official of the   told TOI here on Saturday.

 While work on the Kerala side has been completed, that at the Tamil Nadu has been pending for more than seven years. “The contractor has resumed the work and it is going on at a fast pace. The project would be completed within two months. We just need to make some small repair works, paint the roads and install road safety boards on the road. The stretch will not have any toll plazas and will be free for the public,” the official said.
 
 The 12.16km stretch will have four-lanes and two service roads. The project was supposed to be completed by March, 2013. However, work was stuck for two years due to litigations between the government and L&T. The project is currently being carried out by IVRCL Infrastructures and Projects Ltd.
 
 “The state and the central government did not sanction funds for the project. The entire project cost as per agreement was Rs 852cr. But the actual project estimate is Rs 1,100cr,” the official added.
 
 Road users welcomed the news. “The drive from   to Walayar is extremely dangerous. Several times, I had narrow escape from accidents. The road is very narrow and highly uneven. We are not even aware when and where we are supposed to take a diversion. At some places, the road is two-lane. It becomes more dangerous at night,” said Parveen R, a regular commuter.
 
 Agrees textile factory owner Arvind Subramanian, a resident of Tirupur, who often takes the route to meet his clients in Kerala. “I just spent more than Rs 40,000 on my car as the suspension was damaged after a recent trip through the stretch. The road on the Kerala side is very smooth. But on the Tamil Nadu side, it is a mess. I am forced to drive at a speed of only 40kmph, eventhough it is a highway, as I fear for my life,” Arvind told TOI.
