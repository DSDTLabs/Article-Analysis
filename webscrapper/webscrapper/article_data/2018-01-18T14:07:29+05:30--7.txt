MANGALURU: Minister for food and civil supplies UT   on Wednesday welcomed the Union government’s decision to withdraw   subsidy. 

 He said only the agents were benefitting by the subsidy, and not the people.
 
 Speaking to reporters here, Khader said that only the agencies which arranged Haj tours for Muslims made money out of Haj subsidy scheme. “ I welcome the move and there is nothing wrong in cancelling the subsidy. According to Islam, those who wish to go to Haj, have to make their own financial arrangements. Earlier, the beneficiaries, who availed the subsidy, were made to fly mandatorily in   flights but now there will be no such restrictions. It will lead to a fair competition in the aviation industry. At the same time, pilgrims can book tickets six months in advance and it will also help them get tickets at a much cheaper and discounted rate,” he added.
 
 In 2012, the   had ordered that the subsidy be stopped in a phased manner in five years. Finally, it has ended. However, some people to score brownie points with an intention of catering to a particular community, are claiming that it is a bold move.
