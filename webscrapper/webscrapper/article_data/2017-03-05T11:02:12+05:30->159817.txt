LUCKNOW: Property worth several lakh rupees was gutted in the fire that broke out in Aminabad market, engulfing three shops of readymade garments on Saturday morning. Twelve fire tenders were deployed to contain the fire. According to police, at 7.15 am, fire broke out at a readymade garment shop (near Madhur Milan Hotel) owned by Umesh Kumar. Pavement-dwellers and vendors spotted smoke billowing out of the shop and alerted the shop owner and the police. 

 By the time the fire team and policemen reached the place, the fire had spread further and reached two other garment stores. Soon the flames were leaping high, scaring those around. The fire could be doused after hours of effort by firemen. "Luckily, the fire was controlled in time so more damage could be averted," said chief fire officer AB Pandey.
