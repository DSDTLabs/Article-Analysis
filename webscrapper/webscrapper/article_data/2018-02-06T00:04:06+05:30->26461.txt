Salem: A transsexual who was accused of pushing two men from a running train was arrested and lodged in the Salem central prison on Monday. 

 According to the Jholarpet railway police, K Sathyanarayanan, 32 and his friend Karam Veera Babu, 31, fell from the Alleppey-bound Dhanbad Express near Samalpatty in Krishnagiri district on Friday. Sathyanarayanan succumbed to the injuries on the spot and Karam Veera Babu was taken to the Uthankarai Government Hospital. When Babu regained consciousness, he told railway police a transsexual pushed them from the train after they refused to give her money. 
 
 Based on the statement, the railway police registered a case and identified the transsexual, Shwetha, from the photos available with them. “We have managed to identify Shwetha with the help of other passengers,” said a railway officer.
 
 Meanwhile on Sunday, Shwetha attempted to commit suicide at her home in Tirupathur in Vellore district by consuming poison. Shewtha’s friends found her and took her to the government hospital in Tirupathur. 
 
 After the recovery, Shwetha surrendered before the Jholarpet VAO on the same evening. The VAO informed the Uthankarai police, who took custody of Shwetha and lodged her at the prison. 
 
 The case has been booked under sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC.
