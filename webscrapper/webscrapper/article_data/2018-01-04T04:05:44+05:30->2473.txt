NEW DELHI:   organisations from across the country have called for protests across the nation against “attacks on the community” following incidents of violence in   this week as well as against other incidents in different states. Some of those championing the cause will sit in a dharna on   here on Friday against the recent Maharashtra incident and to demand the release of Bhim Army leader Chandra Shekhar who is custody in Uttar Pradesh. 

 While Dalit leaders have said that they will protest peacefully to remind the government that their issues are not being addressed, they have also questioned the authorities on “why Chandra Shekhar is being held under the National Secrets Act, when there is nothing to prove his crime.” Dalit activist Ashok Bharti said that under NSA, Chandra Shekhar will remain jailed for the next 11 months. 
 
 “There are 84 SC MPs and 47 ST MPs today and about 700 SC\ST MLAs in the country and we have a Dalit President at present. Yet, why do they fail to protect interest of Adivasis and Dalits? Are they morally obliged or stooges of the establishment,” asked Bharti while speaking to TOI.
